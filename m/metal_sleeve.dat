25|$|The WC-130H {{airframes}} {{flown by}} the 53d WRS were originally built in 1964–65 as C-130Es. Hurricane Andrew had also demonstrated {{a need for}} upgraded models to continue the Hurricane Hunter mission, and funding for ten replacements was authorized by Congress in FY1998. On 11 October 1999, the 53d WRS received its first Lockheed WC-130, and flew its first hurricane mission in the new model on 16 November, into Hurricane Lenny. Problems with the new model, primarily damage to its composite material 6-bladed propellers from hail and ice {{and a lack of}} sensitivity in its color radar images, delayed its Initial Operational Capability until just before the 2005 hurricane season. The propeller problem was overcome by bonding a <b>metal</b> <b>sleeve</b> to the leading edge of each blade and the radar issue by changes in the radar software coding.|$|E
2500|$|When {{dealing with}} rubber {{components}} with mold bonded metal sleeves, swaging {{provides a more}} controlled and cost-effective alternative to 'shooting' the rubber part into a <b>metal</b> <b>sleeve,</b> where an intensive and less dependable secondary operation is needed to finish the product. [...] A metal can with a bonding component (such as phosphate) is painted to the inside diameter, and molten rubber is injected into the <b>metal</b> <b>sleeve.</b> This creates a product that when cooled may be swaged to the desired size. [...] The second {{reason for this is}} that the product is more reliable, and during the swaging process the rubber is more relaxed when the outside can to which the rubber is bonded has its diameter reduced, changing the springrate (K) values and damping coefficient (C) of the rubber. [...] After swaging, any inconsistencies in the metal and rubber have been minimized.|$|E
2500|$|Albini [...] "sorta conned" [...] small local label Fever Records into {{financing}} the next Big Black EP, bringing in drummer Pat Byrne of Urge Overkill {{to play on}} the sessions as accompaniment to the drum machine, which they dubbed [...] "Roland" [...] for album credits. Albini achieved a signature [...] "clanky" [...] sound with his guitar by using metal guitar picks notched with sheet metal clips, creating the effect of two guitar picks at once. The Bulldozer EP was recorded with engineer Iain Burgess and released in December 1983, with the first two hundred copies packaged in a galvanized sheet <b>metal</b> <b>sleeve</b> in homage to Public Image Ltd.'s Metal Box. Many of the EP's lyrics depicted scenarios drawn from Albini's midwest upbringing, such as [...] "Cables", which described the slaughtering of cows at a Montana abattoir, and [...] "Pigeon Kill", about a rural Indiana town that dealt with an overpopulation of pigeons by feeding them poisoned corn.|$|E
30|$|The {{manufacturing}} tolerance of the <b>metal</b> <b>sleeves</b> {{and of the}} osteotomy drills {{may need to be}} included into the consideration of the errors. As an example, the company Blue Sky Bio (Blue Sky Bio, LLC, USA) [23], with as much as 75 different diameters of <b>metal</b> <b>sleeves</b> gives a {{manufacturing tolerance}} of its products of ±[*] 50  μm. The clearance value should be estimated taking into account the expected manufacturing tolerances.|$|R

50|$|The flatrods (Feldgestänge) {{themselves}} {{were used to}} transfer power over greater distances between the main engine and the pump rods. Iron collars (Kunstringe) were fitted onto the wheel axles, connecting pipes (Ansetzröhren) and <b>metal</b> <b>sleeves</b> (Ansteckkielen) as well as {{certain parts of the}} wooden flatrods. The actual rods (Kunststangen) were long squared timbers that transmitted the power horizontally or at an incline. They had articulated iron joints (Kunstschlösser or Stangenschlösser) that were designed such that they could be interleaved into one another and secured with bolts or screws.|$|R

The tachiuchi/tachiuke would be reinforced with metal rings (naginata dogane or semegane), and/or <b>metal</b> <b>sleeves</b> (sakawa) and wrapped with cord (san-dan maki). The end of the shaft has a heavy metal end cap (ishizuki or hirumaki). When not in use the blade would be covered with a wooden sheath.|$|R
5000|$|Version one {{was based}} on Ford's 2.3-liter Pinto engine and weighed 152 lb (vs. 415 lb for its cast iron counterpart). It was {{designed}} to produce [...] at 9200 rpm. It was composed of <b>metal</b> cylinder <b>sleeves,</b> <b>metal</b> combustion chamber tops, metal piston crowns, bearings, valves and seats, and a stock 2.3L Pinto crankshaft.

5000|$|High-power motor {{reliability}} {{was a significant}} issue in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with catastrophic engine failures occurring relatively frequently (est. 1 in 20) in motors of L class or higher. At costs exceeding $300 per motor, the {{need to find a}} cheaper and more reliable alternative was apparent. Reloadable motor designs (<b>metal</b> <b>sleeves</b> with screwed-on end caps and filled with cast propellant slugs) were introduced by Aerotech and became very popular over the span of a few years. These metal containers needed only to be cleaned and refilled with propellant and a few throw-away components after each launch. The cost of a [...] "reload" [...] was typically half of a comparable single use motor. While catastrophes at take-off (CATOs) still occur occasionally with reloadable motors (mostly due to poor assembly techniques by the user), the reliability of launches has risen significantly.|$|R
5000|$|The grenade {{was unusual}} but not unique, {{in that it}} had an {{optional}} [...] "jacket" [...] - a thick <b>metal</b> fragmentation <b>sleeve</b> weighing an average of 270 grams. When fitted over the grenade the sleeve improves the kill radius by producing a number of diamond-shaped, heavier fragments. With the jacket installed the grenade {{was said to be}} in [...] "defensive" [...] mode.|$|R
30|$|Low-cost {{technologies}} for the in-office production of 3 d guides already exist (SLA and FDM). A low-cost SLA 3 d printer is advertised {{as the ideal}} for a dental practice with the same printer being tested for training in medical procedures [19]. Freeware for the design and the low-cost export of an STL file of the guide is available. The <b>metal</b> <b>sleeves</b> that are usually incorporated into the guide {{in order to accommodate}} the drill are offered in large numbers of internal and external dimensions. The dentist, almost by definition, possesses a high level of engineering and material skills [20]. He/she is currently able to accommodate their surgical need with a low-cost, fast-produced and fully CAD/CAM surgical guide. In the present study, we focus on the errors made during the manufacturing of such a guide and especially those depending on the way the metal components of the guide interrelate with the osteotomy bur and with the planned position of the implant. However, it should be stressed that {{the results of this study}} remain relevant for every implant surgical guide irrespective of the way it is manufactured, 3 d-printed or other.|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{technique has}} been developed for imposing controlled multi-axial loading on cylindrical ceramic specimens. The multi-axial loading is achieved by superposing passive lateral confinement upon axial compression. Descriptions of the experimental technique, as well as experimental results for a machinable glass ceramic, Macor, are presented. The axial compression was applied using a Kolsky (split Hopkinson) pressure bar modified to apply a single loading pulse. Experiments were also conducted under quasi-static conditions using a servo-hydraulic load frame. The specimens were confined laterally using shrink-fit <b>metal</b> <b>sleeves.</b> The confining pressure ranges from 10 to 230 MPa. Under both quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions, the experimental {{results showed that the}} failure mode changes from fragmentation by axial splitting without confinement to localized faulting under moderate lateral confinement (10 – 120 MPa). The process of fault initiation was characterized in detail for specimens under moderate confinement. Based on the experimental results, a compressive failure mechanism was proposed for brittle materials under moderate lateral confinement. The Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion was found to fit the experimental strength data. The failure criterion is shown to be consistent with the analytical results from a micromechanical model for brittle failure. Transition from brittle to ductile behavior was observed under high confinement (230 MPa) ...|$|R
30|$|It is {{the aim of}} {{this paper}} to compute the maximum errors in the {{positioning}} of the implants with relation to the basic mechanical components of a 3 d surgical guide/surgical kit combination taking into account the positional and dimensional properties of the guide’s <b>metal</b> part (<b>sleeve)</b> and the dimensional properties of any osteotomy bur used. The analytical equations for the bespoke computation of the errors for any conceivable combination of the relevant parameters will be provided. Reference tables will be reported facilitating the in-office production of any 3 d surgical implant guide.|$|R

50|$|Care must {{be taken}} when {{controlling}} most double acting telescopic design cylinders. The effective retraction area is often {{much less than the}} extension area. Thus if the hydraulic fluid return line is blocked during extension apressure intensifying effect can occur causing seal failure or even causing the <b>metal</b> <b>sleeve</b> to balloon outward. The cylinder could thus be rendered unable to retract because of failed seals or jam in position due to binding.|$|E
50|$|The {{first product}} created was for Suzuki’s GSX-R750, when R&G {{developed}} a round-shaped protector constructed from high-density Polyethylene (HDPE).

This initial protector used a thin <b>metal</b> <b>sleeve</b> inside, meaning strength was increased while also allowing the fitter to torque the protector. The bung also used a particular grade of steel bolt that helped absorb an impact by bending, rather than snapping or twisting its mounting point on the bike.|$|E
