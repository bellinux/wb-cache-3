50|$|Lautering is the {{separation}} of the wort (the liquid containing the sugar extracted during mashing) from the grains. This is done either in a mash tun outfitted with a false bottom, in a lauter tun, or in a <b>mash</b> <b>filter.</b> Most separation processes have two stages: first wort run-off, during which the extract is separated in an undiluted state from the spent grains, and sparging, in which extract which remains with the grains is rinsed off with hot water. The lauter tun is a tank with holes in the bottom small enough to hold back the large bits of grist and hulls. The bed of grist that settles on it is the actual filter. Some lauter tuns have provision for rotating rakes or knives to cut into the bed of grist to maintain good flow. The knives can be turned so they push the grain, a feature used to drive the spent grain out of the vessel. The <b>mash</b> <b>filter</b> is a plate-and-frame filter. The empty frames contain the mash, including the spent grains, and have a capacity of around one hectoliter. The plates contain a support structure for the filter cloth. The plates, frames, and filter cloths are arranged in a carrier frame like so: frame, cloth, plate, cloth, with plates {{at each end of the}} structure. Newer mash filters have bladders that can press the liquid out of the grains between spargings. The grain does not act like a filtration medium in a <b>mash</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mashing is {{the process}} of mixing milled, usually malted, grain with water, and heating it with rests at certain {{temperatures}} to allow enzymes in the malt to break down the starches in the grain into sugars, especially maltose. Lautering is the separation of the extracts won during mashing from the spent grain to create wort. It is achieved in either a lauter tun, a wide vessel with a false bottom, or a <b>mash</b> <b>filter,</b> a plate-and-frame filter designed for this kind of separation. Lautering has two stages: first wort run-off, during which the extract is separated in an undiluted state from the spent grains, and sparging, in which extract that remains with the grains is rinsed off with hot water.|$|E
50|$|In 1970 the {{distillery}} {{was greatly}} expanded, and an entire new building with six new stills {{was taken in}} operation. The four older stills remained in operation alongside the new stills. The old side of the distillery was then updated over the next decade. First, new installations for milling, mashing and fermentation were built in 1973, and in 1975 the distillery added a dark grains plant, which produces cattle feed from the draff. In 1984 the old side of the distillery was mothballed, and the new side followed the next year, temporarily ending production entirely. The new side of the distillery resumed production in 1991. The old side didn't resume production, and was demolished in 1999. In 2000 a <b>mash</b> <b>filter</b> press was installed in the distillery, which is unique in Scottish malt whisky production; all other Scottish whisky distilleries use mash tuns.|$|E

40|$|Brewing with unmalted barley {{can reduce}} the use of raw materials, thereby {{increasing}} {{the efficiency of the}} brewing process. However, unmalted barley contains several undesired components for brewing and has a low enzymatic activity. Pearling, an abrasive milling method, has been proposed as a pre-treatment for barley to remove some of its undesired components, while maintaining its β-amylase activity. The potential of combining pearling with using barley/malt mixtures for brewing was studied. Filtration was performed either in a <b>mash</b> <b>filter</b> or in a lauter tun. The effects of the different barley/malt ratios, degree of pearling and two different filter types on compositional and quality parameters were assessed.

40|$|This paper analyses, in a {{full-scale}} industrial process, the flavonoids, non-flavonoids, tannins and non tannins in all malt worts and in maize adjunct worts and their fate during the main brewing steps. The effect on wort phenols {{of two different}} wort separation technologies, a <b>mash</b> <b>filter</b> (Meura 2001) and a lauter tun (Steinecker FVAS 26), were also investigated. The results obtained showed that total phenols are lower in maize-adjunct, than in all-malt worts (542 mg/L and 730 mg/L, respectively), and that non tannins are the main phenolic components: 91 % of the total in all-malt and 82 % in maize-adjunct worts, respectively. The overall brewing process reduces the initial content of total phenols by 50 %, and the highest reduction is on tannins and flavonoids. After the brewing process, total phenols in beer were 336. 5 mg/L in all-malt and 280 mg/L in maize adjunct. In moderate drinkers they contribute to 10 – 20 % of the total phenolic daily intake accounting for around 4 – 8 % of the total antioxidant capacity of the diet. As regards the influence of lauter tun and <b>mash</b> <b>filter</b> on phenols, our results showed their great depletion when using lauter tun, and suggested that the brewing process may be adapted in order to overcome the high impact of lauter tun on phenols...|$|E
40|$|Brewing with {{fractionated}} barley Beer is a globally consumed beverage, {{which is}} produced from malted barley, water, hops and yeast. In recent years, {{the use of}} unmalted barley and exogenous enzymes have become more popular because they enable simpler processing and reduced environmental impact. Raw barley, however, contains less endogenous enzymes and more undesired components {{for the use of}} beer brewing, compared to malted barley.   The overall aim of this thesis is to investigate how barley can be fractionated to optimize the use of resources for the beer brewing process, while maintaining the quality of the brewed beer. A resource use efficiency analysis was performed to verify the presumed benefits on the environmental sustainability of the proposed process change. The work was based on the hypothesis that fractionation of the unprocessed barley will reduce the amount of undesired components, which leads to improvements in the brewing process based on partial or no malting. Fractionation can be performed by milling and separation, which requires physical disentanglement of the components. This fractionation can be influenced by properties of the components of the material, such as the glass transition temperature (Stuart et al.). Fractionation by abrasive milling, also known as pearling, is another possibility: here one makes use of the spatial distribution of components in the kernels. In case of barley for brewing this technique is especially promising as most of the undesired components are in the outer layer of the kernel. In addition, the removal of bran from the barley reduces the amount of water needed in the process. It will also reduce the volume of spent grains, hence reducing wastes and energy required for drying the spent grains. A disadvantage of pearling is however that it lowers the ability of the barley kernel to produce enzymes. This leads to the need of the addition of exogenous enzymes, as is the case when the malting step is omitted.   Chapter 2 describes the glass-to-rubber transition of protein and starch isolated from the barley endosperm, for different moisture levels. The hypothesis for this chapter is that dry fractionation by milling is facilitated by milling conditions in which the protein is in a rubbery state and the starch in a glassy state. Two methods were used to measure the Tg; differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermo-mechanical compression tests (TMCT). The methods gave different results due to the differences in moisture content range, and heating rates, which may lead to conformational changes of the protein. The value of the Tg of partially crystalline materials, such as starch in barley, was not unambiguous when using TMCT because the mechanical effect of expansion of these materials was smaller. For both results, the Tg lines were modelled using the Gordon-Taylor equation. Based on sorption isotherms, it was concluded that moisture does not distribute evenly over the protein and starch in the kernel. Starch absorbs more moisture than protein at given water activities. This required a correction of the Tg lines. After this correction, the glass transition lines of starch and protein were closer together. The expectation is therefore that achieving good separation between the components based on having one glassy component and one rubbery component is challenging. For this reason, another dry fractionation technique, pearling, was considered. Chapter 3 describes the chemical composition of the barley and of fractions removed by pearling. Pearling was shown to selectively remove insoluble fibre, ash, protein and polyphenols, while the β-amylase activity and starch content of the remaining kernel was hardly affected. For example, removing the outer 5 % of the kernel reduced insoluble arabinoxylans (15 %), insoluble fibres (23 %), ash (19 %), polyphenols (11 %) and water holding capacity of the non-starch components (25 %), while only lowering starch content by 0. 20 %. The water holding capacity of the barley fractions was strongly related to the fibre content. This indicates that when the fibre content in the mash was reduced by pearling, the spent grains will take up less water, leading to less wort and sugar losses in this waste stream, and hence better use of the raw materials and less wastes. Chapter 4 compares a traditional brewing process to an enzyme-assisted brewing process with respect to their resource use efficiency, which is one aspect of the sustainability of the processes. The use of exogenous enzymes is found to be more efficient than producing enzymes through the malting process. The exergetic efficiency of the conventional malting process was 77 %. The main losses stem from the use of natural gas for removal of moisture from the barley in the kilning process, and from the loss of starch in the germination process. In case of the use of exogenous enzymes, it was concluded that the chemical exergy content of the enzymes was not a good measure for the exergy content of the enzymes. Instead, we proposed to use the cumulative exergetic consumption in the enzyme production rather than just the chemical exergy content of the enzymes. This cumulative exergetic consumption in the production of the enzymes was ± 30 times higher than their standard chemical exergy. This shows that the cumulative exergetic costs of minor components should be taken into account if a process uses them in significant quantities. This can be done by extending the system boundaries to include the production process of the purified components. The exergy efficiency of the enzyme formulation production process ranges between 20 % and 42 % depending on whether the by-product of the fermentation broth was considered as useful as the enzyme product. Even though the cumulative exergy consumption of the process was 30 times the standard chemical exergy of the dry enzyme, the total exergy input (i. e. both wasted and destroyed) for the production of 100 kg of beer was still larger for the conventional malting process (441 MJ) than for the enzyme-assisted process (354 MJ). In addition, beer produced using exogenous enzymes reduces the use of water by 7 %, of raw materials by 14 %, and of natural gas by 78 %. Thus, the exergy loss of the enzyme production process is more than compensated by the prevention of exergy loss in the total beer brewing process. Chapter 5 describes brewing tests using malted, unmalted and pearled, unmalted barley kernels. Brewing with unmalted barley saves material, energy and water in the malting stage but may result in complications during processing. Pearling mitigates these problems. Exogenous enzymes were used to compensate for the low enzyme activity in unmalted barley. Lautertun filtration and mash filtration were considered as filtration methods. Principle component analysis was performed on the chemical composition of the wort and the various spent grains, to investigate the effect of the malt-to-barley ratio, the degree of pearling and the filter method. A <b>mash</b> <b>filter</b> is optimal for this type of process, and we identified a window of operation in which optimal use is made of the raw materials while maintaining the end product quality, judged on basis of 4 quality parameters. The concluding chapter 6 presents a general discussion of all results described in this thesis. In addition, the benefits of pearling over that of milling and fractionation, and the effect of pearling on milling properties were discussed. Furthermore, it explores the advantages in environmental sustainability that can be achieved by pearling. Pearling as a pre-treatment for malting reduces the enzyme activity of germinating barley, and therefore the mash quality. This thesis provides insights in how pre-treatment of barley can make beer brewing more efficient in the use of resources. It stresses the need to optimally use all material streams in a process, to be able to design an environmentally sustainable process, and it shows that efficient resource use is key for achieving this. Additionally the value of enzymes as processing aids was discussed. A clear result is that one needs to include the resource use in the production of enzymes or other processing aids, when analyzing the environmental sustainability of a process, since this can be significant in the overall process.    ...|$|E
50|$|When kilning is complete, {{the grains}} are now termed malt, {{and they will}} be milled or crushed to break apart the kernels and expose the cotyledon, which {{contains}} the majority of the carbohydrates and sugars; this makes it easier to extract the sugars during mashing. Milling also separates the seed from the husk. Care must be taken when milling to ensure that the starch reserves are sufficiently milled without damaging the husk and providing coarse enough grits that a good filter bed can be formed during lautering. Grains are typically dry-milled with roller mills or hammer mills. Hammer mills, which produce a very fine mash, are often used when <b>mash</b> <b>filters</b> are going to be employed in the lautering process because the grain does not have to form its own filter bed. In modern plants, the grain is often conditioned with water before it is milled to make the husk more pliable, thus reducing breakage and improving lauter speed.|$|R
40|$|Fine milling in {{combination}} with thinbed <b>mash</b> <b>filters</b> has been introduced into the brewing industry more than 20 years ago. Although clearest worts can be obtained at highest gravity, {{in combination}} with high extract yield and improved starch conversion, a majority of brewers still use the conventional coarse milling {{in combination with}} lautertuns. Brewers seem still afraid having a negative impact of fine milling on wort and beer quality {{especially with regard to}} over extraction of polyphenols, proteins and oxidative enzymes. A lack of detailed data comparing both wort production methods could be a reason. In this study, the faster wort filtration as well as higher extract yield has been confirmed when using fine milling and a thin bed filter. A higher concentration of fermentable sugar led to this increased yield and not an increased level of proteins and polyphenols. On the contrary, fine milling in combination with thicker mash and thin bed filtration results in a lower level of haze sensitive protein in the pitching wort in comparison to coarse grist and the use of a lautertun. No striking differences have been found comparing analyses of fresh beer. Also during forced ageing of the beers at 30 [*]°C, no difference in the formation of flavour negative compounds or degradation of bitterness has been noticed. Both wort production methods result in highly comparable beers with equal flavour stability. status: publishe...|$|R

30|$|Malted barley, {{the most}} common {{ingredient}} used to produce beer, is made by germinating barley. Afterwards, the grains are dried and crushed to remove the germ. This mixture is then treated in hot water, at 70 – 74  °C where the grain starch is converted to fermentable sugars (<b>mashing</b> step). The <b>filtered</b> sugar-rich liquid {{also known as the}} wart is fermented to produce beer, and the rejected retentate is known as the brewers’ spent grain. World beer production was reported to be 193 billion liters in 2014 and the globally leading countries in beer production are China, United States and Brazil (FAO 2017). Furthermore, for every 100  L of beer produced 20  kg of BSG is generated during processing (Mussatto et al. 2006). Thus, BSG is generated in massive quantities throughout the world. BSG accounts for approximately 85 % of the by-products generated in the brewery industry (Mussatto et al. 2006) and for 30 – 60 % of BOD (biological oxygen demand) and suspended solids generated by a typical brewery (Aliyu and Bala 2010).|$|R
