5|$|Rhabdomyolysis {{may cause}} kidney failure by several mechanisms. The most {{important}} is the accumulation of myoglobin in the kidney tubules. Normally, the blood protein haptoglobin binds circulating myoglobin and other heme-containing substances, but in rhabdomyolysis the quantity of myoglobin exceeds the binding capacity of haptoglobin. <b>Myoglobinuria,</b> the presence of myoglobin in the urine, occurs when the level in plasma exceeds 0.5–1.5mg/dl; once plasma levels reach 100mg/dl, the concentration in the urine becomes sufficient {{for it to be}} visibly discolored and corresponds with the destruction of about 200grams of muscle. As the kidneys reabsorb more water from the , myoglobin interacts with Tamm–Horsfall protein in the nephron to form casts (solid aggregates) that obstruct the normal flow of fluid; the condition is worsened further by high levels of uric acid and acidification of the filtrate, which increase cast formation. Iron released from the heme generates reactive oxygen species, damaging the kidney cells. In addition to the <b>myoglobinuria,</b> two other mechanisms contribute to kidney impairment: low blood pressure leads to constriction of the blood vessels and therefore a relative lack of blood flow to the kidney, and finally uric acid may form crystals in the tubules of the kidneys, causing obstruction. Together, these processes lead to acute tubular necrosis, the destruction of the cells of tubules. Glomerular filtration rate falls and the kidney is unable to perform its normal excretory functions. This causes disruption of electrolyte regulation, leading to a further rise in potassium levels, and interferes with vitamin D processing, further worsening the low calcium levels.|$|E
5|$|If an {{underlying}} muscle disease is suspected, for instance {{if there is}} no obvious explanation or there have been multiple episodes, {{it may be necessary to}} perform further investigations. During an attack, low levels of carnitine in the blood and high levels of acylcarnitine in blood and urine may indicate a lipid metabolism defect, but these abnormalities revert to normal during convalescence. Other tests may be used at that stage to demonstrate these disorders. Disorders of glycolysis can be detected by various means, including the measurement of lactate after exercise; a failure of the lactate to rise may be indicative of a disorder in glycolysis, while an exaggerated response is typical of mitochondrial diseases. Electromyography (EMG) may show particular patterns in specific muscle diseases; for instance, McArdle's disease and phosphofructokinase deficiency show a phenomenon called cramp-like contracture. There are genetic tests available for many of the hereditary muscle conditions that predispose to <b>myoglobinuria</b> and rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
25|$|Mutations of the M subunit {{have been}} linked to the rare disease exertional <b>myoglobinuria</b> (see OMIM article), and {{mutations}} of the H subunit have been described but do not appear to lead to disease.|$|E
25|$|Markedly {{elevated}} CPK levels or if a myopathy {{is suspected}} or diagnosed after dosing of atorvastatin has begun. Very rarely, atorvastatin may cause rhabdomyolysis, {{and it may}} be very serious leading to acute renal failure due to <b>myoglobinuria.</b> If rhabdomyolysis is suspected or diagnosed, atorvastatin therapy should be discontinued immediately. The likelihood of developing a myopathy is increased by the co-administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, niacin, and azole antifungals.|$|E
25|$|A {{complete}} {{lactate dehydrogenase}} enzyme {{consists of four}} protein subunits. Since the two most common subunits found in lactate dehydrogenase are encoded by the LDHA and LDHB genes, either variation of this disease causes abnormalities {{in many of the}} lactate dehydrogenase enzymes found in the body. In the case of lactate dehydrogenase-A deficiency, mutations to the LDHA gene results in the production of an abnormal lactate dehydrogenase-A subunit that cannot bind to the other subunits to form the complete enzyme. This lack of a functional subunit reduces the amount of enzyme formed, leading to an overall decrease in activity. During the anaerobic phase of glycolysis (the Cori Cycle), the mutated enzyme is unable to convert pyruvate into lactate to produce the extra energy the cells need. Since this subunit has the highest concentration in the LDH enzymes found in the skeletal muscles (which are the primary muscles responsible for movement), high-intensity physical activity will lead to an insufficient amount of energy being produced during this anaerobic phase. This in turn will cause the muscle tissue to weaken and eventually break down, a condition known as rhabdomyolysis. The process of rhabdomyolysis also releases myoglobin into the blood, which will eventually end up in the urine and cause it to become red or brown: another condition known as <b>myoglobinuria.</b> Some other common symptoms are exercise intolerance, which consists of fatigue, muscle pain, and cramps during exercise, and skin rashes. In severe cases, <b>myoglobinuria</b> can damage the kidneys and lead to life-threatening kidney failure. In order to obtain a definitive diagnosis, a muscle biopsy may be performed to confirm low or absent LDH activity. There is currently no specific treatment for this condition.|$|E
500|$|As {{detectable}} {{levels of}} myoglobinemia and <b>myoglobinuria</b> occur, blood tests and urine tests may show {{elevated levels of}} myoglobin. For example, a urine test strip may reveal a positive result for [...] "blood", even though no red blood cells can be identified on microscopy of the urine; this occurs because the reagent on the test strip reacts with myoglobin. The same phenomenon may happen in conditions that lead to hemolysis, the destruction of red blood cells; in hemolysis the blood serum is also visibly discolored, while in rhabdomyolysis it is normal. If kidney damage has occurred, microscopy of the urine also reveals urinary casts that appear pigmented and granular.|$|E

5000|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of <b>myoglobinuria</b> are usually nonspecific and needs some clinical prudence.Therefore, among the possible signs {{and symptoms}} to look for would be: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Myoglobinuria</b> is the {{presence}} of myoglobin in the urine, usually associated with rhabdomyolysis or muscle destruction. Myoglobin is present in muscle cells as a reserve of oxygen.|$|E
50|$|Clinical {{laboratory}} changes include {{evidence of}} rhabdomyolysis (elevated CK and AST, <b>myoglobinuria)</b> and low blood selenium levels. On necropsy, muscles are pale with areas of necrosis and edema evidenced as white streaks.|$|E
50|$|Dark brown: Intake {{of certain}} {{medications}} or other substances; damaged muscle (<b>myoglobinuria)</b> from extreme exercise or other widespread damage; altered blood; intake of phenolic substances; inadequate porphyrin metabolism; melanin from melanocytic tumors.|$|E
50|$|Mutations of the M subunit {{have been}} linked to the rare disease exertional <b>myoglobinuria</b> (see OMIM article), and {{mutations}} of the H subunit have been described but do not appear to lead to disease.|$|E
50|$|Muscle tissue {{destruction}} {{can lead}} to <b>myoglobinuria,</b> with renal failure following in severe cases; {{this is similar to}} burns from electric current. Urinalysis and serum CPK, BUN and creatine tests are used to check for this condition.|$|E
50|$|The {{diagnosis}} is often made {{based on the}} medical history, blood samples, and a urine sample. The absence of urine RBCs and RBC casts microscopically despite a positive dipstick test suggests hemoglobinuria or <b>myoglobinuria.</b> The medical term for RBCs in the urine is hematuria.|$|E
50|$|<b>Myoglobinuria</b> {{pathophysiology}} {{consist of}} a series of metabolic actions in which damage to muscle cells affect calcium mechanisms, thereby increasing free ionized calcium (cytoplasm). This in turn affects several enzymes that are calcium dependent, thereby compromising the cell membrane, which in turn causes the release of myoglobin.|$|E
50|$|Deficiency in PFK {{leads to}} glycogenosis type VII (Tarui's disease), an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder characterised by severe nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps and <b>myoglobinuria</b> {{in response to}} bursts of intense or vigorous exercise. Sufferers are usually able to lead a reasonably ordinary life by learning to adjust activity levels.|$|E
50|$|Equine {{atypical}} myopathy, {{also known}} as atypical <b>myoglobinuria,</b> or EAM is a mortal disease of horses (equidae) characterized by acute rhabdomyolysis. It {{is believed to be}} caused by the ingestion of the seeds (or young shoots) of Acer pseudoplatanus in Europe and Acer negundo in America. EAM has a high mortality rate and numerous fatalities have occurred.|$|E
5000|$|The adult myopathic form of {{this disease}} was first {{characterized}} in 1973 by DiMauro and DiMauro. It {{is the most common}} inherited disorder of lipid metabolism affecting the skeletal muscle of adults. CPT II deficiency is also the most frequent cause of hereditary <b>myoglobinuria.</b> [...] Symptoms of this disease are commonly provoked by prolonged exercise or periods without food.|$|E
50|$|The {{onset of}} this disease is usually noticed in childhood, but often not {{diagnosed}} until {{the third or fourth}} decade of life. Symptoms include exercise intolerance with muscle pain, early fatigue, painful cramps, and myoglobin in the urine (often provoked by a bout of exercise). <b>Myoglobinuria</b> may result from the breakdown of skeletal muscle known as rhabdomyolysis, a condition in which muscle cells breakdown, sending their contents into the bloodstream.|$|E
5000|$|Markedly {{elevated}} CPK levels or if a myopathy {{is suspected}} or diagnosed after dosing of atorvastatin has begun. Very rarely, atorvastatin may cause rhabdomyolysis, {{and it may}} be very serious leading to acute renal failure due to <b>myoglobinuria.</b> If rhabdomyolysis is suspected or diagnosed, atorvastatin therapy should be discontinued immediately. The likelihood of developing a myopathy is increased by the co-administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, niacin, and azole antifungals.|$|E
50|$|Tarui {{disease is}} a {{glycogen}} storage disease with symptoms including muscle weakness (myopathy) and exercise induced cramping and spasms, <b>myoglobinuria</b> (presence of myoglobin in urine, indicating muscle destruction) and compensated hemolysis. ATP is a natural allosteric inhibitor of PFK, {{in order to prevent}} unnecessary production of ATP through glycolysis. However, a mutation in Asp(543)Ala can result in ATP having a stronger inhibitory effect (due to increased binding to PFK’s inhibitory allosteric binding site).|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} to use an ammonia sulphate precipitation test in order to distinguish between hemoglobinuria and <b>myoglobinuria.</b> This consists of adding 2.8gr of ammonia sulphate to 5 ml of centrifuged urine, mixing well and after 5 minutes filtering the sample and centrifuging again. The hemoglobin precipitates out with the ammonia sulphate but not the myoglobin. Analysis of the supernatant for blood with a test strip will give a positive if myoglobin is present and a negative if hemoglobin is present.|$|E
50|$|Lactate {{dehydrogenase}} A catalyzes the inter-conversion of pyruvate and L-lactate with concomitant inter-conversion of NADH and NAD+. LDHA {{is found}} in most somatic tissues, though predominantly in muscle tissue and tumours, and belongs to the lactate dehydrogenase family. It {{has long been known}} that many human cancers have higher LDHA levels compared to normal tissues. It has also been shown that LDHA {{plays an important role in}} the development, invasion and metastasis of malignancies. Mutations in LDHA have been linked to exertional <b>myoglobinuria.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sea {{snake venom}} can cause damage to {{skeletal}} muscle with consequent <b>myoglobinuria,</b> neuromuscular paralysis or direct renal damage. The venoms of significant species of sea snake are neutralised with Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Ltd (of Melbourne, Australia) sea snake (Enhydrina schistosa) antivenom. If that preparation is not available, tiger snake or polyvalent antivenom should be used. No deaths {{have been recorded}} from bites in Australian waters. The E. schistosa antivenom was tested specifically on Pelamus platurus, and it effectively neutralised the venom.|$|E
50|$|Tarui's disease - An {{inborn error}} of {{glycogen}} metabolism characterized by phosphofructokinase deficiency in the muscles, associated with abnormal deposition of glycogen in muscle tissues. Tarui disease typically {{manifests itself in}} childhood with exercise intolerance and anaemia. The fatal variant normally onsets within {{the first year of}} life, and all reported cases have died before the age of four. The adult variant normally sets in in late adulthood in the form of progressive limb muscle weakness without <b>myoglobinuria</b> or cramps.|$|E
5000|$|Patients may {{exhibit a}} “second wind” phenomenon. This is {{characterized}} by the patient’s better tolerance for aerobic exercise such as walking and cycling after approximately 10 minutes. [...] This is attributed to the combination of increased blood flow and the ability of the body to find alternative sources of energy, like fatty acids and proteins. In the long term, patients may exhibit renal failure due to the <b>myoglobinuria,</b> and with age, patients may exhibit progressively increasing weakness and substantial muscle loss.|$|E
50|$|Classic {{phosphofructokinase}} deficiency is {{the most}} common type of this disorder. This type presents with exercise-induced muscle cramps and weakness (sometimes rhabdomyolysis), <b>myoglobinuria,</b> as well as with haemolytic anaemia causing dark urine a few hours later.Hyperuricemia is common, due to the kidneys' inability to process uric acid following damage resulting from processing myoglobin. Nausea and vomiting following strenuous exercise is another common indicator of classic PFK deficiency. Many patients will also display high levels of bilirubin, which can lead to a jaundiced appearance. Symptoms for this type of PFK deficiency usually appear in early childhood.|$|E
50|$|Hospitalization and IV {{hydration}} {{should be}} the first step in any patient suspected of having <b>myoglobinuria</b> or rhabdomyolysis. The goal is to induce a brisk diuresis to prevent myoglobin precipitation and deposition, which can cause acute kidney injury. Mannitol can be added to assist with diuresis. Adding sodium bicarbonate to the IV fluids will cause alkalinzation of the urine, believed to reduce the breakdown of myoglobin into its nephrotoxic metabolites, thus preventing renal damage. Often, IV normal saline is all that is needed to induce diuresis and alkalinize the urine.|$|E
50|$|No nephrotoxins (kidney toxins) have so {{far been}} {{isolated}} from inland taipan snake venoms, but renal (kidney) impairment or acute renal failure can occur secondary to severe rhabdomyolysis. Taipan snake venom does contain myotoxins that cause myolysis (rhabdomyolysis, muscle damage); the urine of a bite victim often turns reddish-brown as their muscles dissolve and are passed through the kidneys (<b>Myoglobinuria).</b> The kidneys are often badly damaged by filtering so much tissue debris out of the blood, and kidney failure is a common complication in serious cases where there is significant envenoming.|$|E
50|$|Onset is {{generally}} noted as childhood to early adult though some {{who may be}} mildly affected by the disorder may not know they have it. Patients with PGAM deficiency are usually asymptomatic, except when they engage in brief, strenuous efforts which may trigger myalgias, cramps, muscle necrosis and <b>myoglobinuria.</b> An unusual pathologic feature of PGAM deficiency is the association with tubular aggregates. The symptoms are an intolerance to physical exertion or activity, cramps and muscle pain. Permanent weakness is rare. The disease is not progressive and has an excellent prognosis.|$|E

50|$|Cocaine can be snorted, swallowed, injected, or smoked. Most deaths due {{to cocaine}} are {{accidental}} {{but may also}} be the result of body packing or stuffing with rupture in the gastrointestinal tract. Use of cocaine causes tachyarrhythmias and a marked elevation of blood pressure (hypertension), which can be life-threatening. This can lead to death from acute myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, or heart failure. Cocaine overdose may result in hyperthermia as stimulation and increased muscular activity cause greater heat production. Heat loss is also inhibited by the cocaine-induced vasoconstriction. Cocaine and/or associated hyperthermia may cause muscle cell destruction (rhabdomyolysis) and <b>myoglobinuria</b> resulting in renal failure. Individuals with cocaine overdose should be transported immediately to the nearest emergency department, preferably by ambulance in case cardiac arrest occurs en route. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, approximately 5000 deaths occur annually in the US due to cocaine overdose.|$|E
