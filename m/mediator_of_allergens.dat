40|$|Objectives: The main {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the levels of house dust mite (Der p 1), dog (Can f 1), cat (Fel d 1) and cockroach (Bla g 2) allergens in kindergartens localized in an urban agglomeration. Material and Methods: A quantitative analysis <b>of</b> <b>allergens</b> was carried out in settled dust samples collected by vacuuming the floor surface in three kindergartens (N = 84) and children's clothing (N = 36). The samples were collected in springsummer and autumn-winter periods as well as at the beginning and end of the week. The allergen dust concentration was determined by enzyme-linked immunoenzymatic assay (ELISA). Results: The mean geometric concentrations (±geometric standard deviations) <b>of</b> <b>allergens</b> Der p 1, Can f 1, Fel d 1 and Bla g 2 determined in kindergartens were: 0. 02 ± 3. 21 μg/g of dust; 0. 97 ± 4. 49 μg/g of dust; 0. 30 ± 4. 43 μg/g of dust and 0. 01 ± 3. 08 μg/g of dust, respectively. Younger classrooms (children aged from 3 to 4 years) were characterized by almost twice higher mean concentration <b>of</b> <b>allergen</b> Fel d 1, as compared to older classrooms (children aged from 5 to 6 years) (p < 0. 05). A significant impact of seasonality on the level <b>of</b> dog <b>allergen</b> Can f 1 was found (p < 0. 05). No significant weekly variation was found in average concentrations <b>of</b> the <b>allergens.</b> Children who had a dog and/or cat at home were characterized by high concentrations <b>of</b> <b>allergens</b> Can f 1 and Fel d 1 on their clothes (59. 2 ± 5. 39 μg Can f 1 /g of dust; 3. 63 ± 1. 47 μg Fel d 1 /g of dust), significantly higher than concentrations <b>of</b> <b>allergens</b> in children who did not have any pets (p < 0. 001).

Short-term exposure (5 – 12 days) to diesel exhaust particles (DEPs) (1 µg/cm 2), bacterial lipopolysaccharide endotoxin (0. 1 µg/cm 2) and benzyl benzoate (3. 2 µg/cm 2), at concentrations exceeding those expected in homes, had no significant effect on allergen transcription.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{recommend}} {{guidelines for}} the use <b>of</b> <b>allergen</b> immunotherapy to treat allergies in patients for whom allergen avoidance and drug therapy have not been sufficiently effective. OPTIONS: High-dose or low-dose allergen immunotherapy {{for the treatment of}} IgE-mediated allergy to insect stings, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma. OUTCOMES: Clinical evaluation of symptoms, objective measurement of reactions to nasal or bronchial allergen challenge, immunologic changes as a result <b>of</b> <b>allergen</b> immunotherapy and, among patients with anaphylactic reactions to stinging insects, clinical outcome of intentional sting challenge. EVIDENCE: A search of MEDLINE was conducted to identify articles that presented results <b>of</b> <b>allergen</b> immunotherapy. Proceedings <b>of</b> symposia held by international subcommittees and of consensus meetings, as well as references obtained from these sources, were reviewed. The articles were grouped according to their main subject: immunologic effects, specific allergies, the results of randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials, types <b>of</b> <b>allergen</b> extract and protocols for allergen immunotherapy, adverse effects and deficiencies <b>of</b> <b>allergen</b> immunotherapy. VALUES: Each member of the working group assessed the importance of such issues as basic immunologic effects, clinical efficacy, adverse effects and inappropriate use; the working group then arrived at a consensus. BENEFITS, HARMS AND COSTS: Implementation of these guidelines would lead to the appropriate use <b>of</b> <b>allergen</b> immunotherapy and control inappropriate treatment, which could result in adverse effects and increased costs of services for patients with allergies. RECOMMENDATIONS: Allergen immunotherapy with specific, standardized allergenic materials, administered in high-dose schedules, is effective in patients with an allergy to insect stings or allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and in some patients with asthma, who have been correctly diagnosed through a meticulous history corroborated by positive results of skin tests and for whom avoidance <b>of</b> the <b>allergen</b> and drug therapy are not sufficiently effective.

40|$|AbstractLow doses <b>of</b> {{environmental}} <b>allergens</b> {{have been}} proposed to increase bronchial hyperreactivity in sensitised individuals, without causing immediate asthmatic reactions. The primary aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate whether repeated low doses <b>of</b> <b>allergen,</b> that do not cause overt bronchoconstriction, cause augmented non-specific bronchial reactivity. A secondary aim was to evaluate whether any changes in reactivity are associated with increased variability of lung function, and whether signs of inflammatory activity could be found. To do this, mild asthmatic patients without regular symptoms, but with both immediate and late reactions in response to a high dose <b>of</b> inhaled cat <b>allergen</b> extract, were included in a double blind, placebo controlled, cross-over study in which a low dose <b>of</b> <b>allergen</b> was administered on four consecutive days (Monday to Thursday). The dose <b>of</b> <b>allergen</b> was individualised for each patient, and was calculated to be 25 % of the total dose given to produce an immediate and late response at screening. Repeated low dose allergen exposure produced a significant increase in methacholine reactivity compared to placebo, whereas FEV 1 in the morning did not significantly change during the allergen week. Each low dose allergen exposure caused small changes in FEV 1 (approximately 7 % drop), which was significant vs. placebo only on day 2 (Tuesday). During the <b>allergen</b> week, six <b>of</b> eight patients reported asthma symptoms on at least one occasion, and variability in lung function, measured with a portable spirometer, was increased. Repeated low doses <b>of</b> <b>allergen</b> also produced a significant increase of P-ECP vs. placebo, without a significant rise in circulating eosinophils. However, no significant changes in circulating CD 3, CD 4, CD 8, CD 19, or CD 25 cells were found, evaluated by FACS analysis. We conclude that low doses <b>of</b> <b>allergen</b> produce signs <b>of</b> a mild exacerbation of asthma, including increased bronchial reactivity to methacholine. This clinical model may be useful to evaluate both the pathophysiological mechanisms of asthma, and the effects of novel anti-asthma drugs...|$|R
