40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of central solar heating plants with seasonal storage (CSHPSS) to cover {{part of the}} heating demand of buildings with district heating in the residential sector is becoming an economically viable option that can contribute significantly to {{the reduction of the}} consumption of fossil fuels. The calculation of CSHPSS systems, with a highly dynamic behaviour, is a complex process in which climatic, demand and design data are required. Simple calculation methods can be used to perform feasibility and pre-design studies enabling an estimation of the annual result. A review of several simple methods that have been proposed for the evaluation and design of the main components of CSHPSS is presented. The methods share some characteristics: <b>main</b> <b>equipments</b> considered, dependence with solar radiation and heating demand; and differ in other aspects: design parameters of the <b>main</b> <b>equipments,</b> secondary equipment considered, degree of detail of climatic and demand input data and equations of the model used to calculate the performance of the system. In this paper a description of each method is presented and results obtained for a base case (installation that produce 50 % of the space heating demand for a community of 1000 dwellings in Zaragoza, Spain) are compared...|$|R

2500|$|Early Chinese armies were {{relatively}} small affairs. Composed of peasant levies, usually serfs {{dependent upon the}} king or the feudal lord of their home state, these armies {{were relatively}} ill-equipped. While organized military forces had existed along with the state, few records remain of these early armies. [...] These armies were centered around the chariot-riding nobility, who played a role akin to the European Knight as they were the main fighting force of the army. Bronze weapons such as spears and swords were the <b>main</b> <b>equipment</b> of both the infantry and charioteers. These armies were ill-trained and haphazardly supplied, meaning {{that they could not}} campaign {{for more than a few}} months and often had to give up their gains due to lack of supplies.|$|E

Research carried out enabled the researcher to administer survey forms and to observe the design and realisation of the equipment models. Results indicate that the <b>main</b> <b>equipments</b> are mills for cereals (millet, sorghum, corn) and fruit, huskers, ginners (grains removers) and oil expellers. These equipments are mainly operated {{at the level of the}} village units. They suffer from low spread. The technological parameters of the dimensioning are not always controlled (capacity, temperature, input and output particle size), as well as the technical parameters (shape, materials used, maintenance). The scale of manufacture and the lack of innovation in the design of these equipments do not allow the installation of real “small industries”. This situation delays the technological development not only of the city and the region, but also of Cameroon because the Far-North region is a great supplier of agricultural products (cereals, tubers, vegetables, oilseeds, fruits) of economic importance...|$|R
