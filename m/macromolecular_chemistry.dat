Here, recent achievements in the field of supramolecular gels that are formed via self-assembly of oligo- and polymeric units through reversible metal–ligand interactions are reviewed.

40|$|The current {{contribution}} {{serves as}} a critical update to a previous feature article from us (Macromol. Rapid Commun. 2012, 33, 958 - 971), and highlights the latest advances {{in the preparation of}} single chain polymeric nanoparticles and initial - yet promising - attempts towards mimicking the structure of natural biomacromolecules via single-chain folding of well-defined linear polymers via so-called single chain selective point folding and repeat unit folding. The contribution covers selected examples from the literature published up to ca. September 2015. Our aim is not to provide an exhaustive review but rather highlight a selection of new and exciting examples for single-chain folding based on advanced <b>macromolecular</b> precision <b>chemistry.</b> Initially, the discussion focuses on the synthesis and characterization of single-chain folded structures via selective point folding. The second part of the feature article addresses the folding of well-defined single-chain polymers by means of repeat unit folding. The current state of the art in the field of single-chain folding indicates that repeat unit folding-driven nanoparticle preparation is well-advanced, while initial encouraging steps towards building selective point folding systems have been taken.

40|$|Several small alkylammonium ions can eliminate, or even reverse, {{the usual}} {{dependence}} of the DNA transition temperature on base composition. For example, in 3 M tetramethylammonium chloride, or 2. 4 M tetraethylammonium chloride, DNAs of different base compositions all melt at a common temperature, and with a greatly decreased breadth of transition reflecting only the sequence-independent components of melting cooperativity. At still higher concentrations of such additives, dG·dC-rich DNAs melt at lower temperatures than dA·dT-rich molecules. Circular dichroism spectra show that these additives alter {{the structure of the}} DNA double helix very little at room temperature. This differential (base-specific) effect on helix stability is investigated with several small additives related to the tetraalkylammonium ions. Additives larger than tetraethylammonium ion have little differential effect on helix stability. Preferential binding of ions to dA·dT base pairs, requiring fit into a “groove” of DNA, is consistent with these data and with equilibrium binding studies. These differential effects can be distinguished from general destabilizing effects, which are independent of specific features of <b>macromolecular</b> conformation or <b>chemistry.</b> Possible experimental uses of this ability to alter the base-composition-dependent components of the stability of the DNA helix are discussed, as well as the insight this phenomenon provides into the molecular basis for the differential stability of dA·dT and dG·dC base pairs...|$|R

40|$|The {{postgraduate}} study of macromolecular sciences (PSMS) was {{established at the}} University of Zagreb in 1971 as a university study {{in the time of}} expressed interdisciplinary permeation of natural sciences - physics, chemistry and biology, and application of their achievements in technologicaldisciplines. PSMS was established by a group of prominent university professors from the schools of Science, Chemical Technology, Pharmacy and Medicine, {{as well as from the}} Institute of Biology. The study comprised basic fields of <b>macromolecular</b> sciences: organic <b>chemistry</b> of synthetic macromolecules, physical chemistry of macromolecules, physics of macromolecules, biological macromolecules and polymer engineering with polymer application and processing, and teaching was performed in 29 lecture courses lead by 30 professors with their collaborators.

During 9 years of existence of PSMS the MSci grade was awarded to 37 macromolecular experts. It was assessed that the PSMS some thirty years ago was an important example of modern postgraduate education as compared with the international postgraduate development.

40|$|The {{attachment}} of microbial {{cells to}} solid substrata {{is a primary}} ecological strategy {{for the survival of}} species and the development of specific activity and function within communities. An hypothesis arising from a biological sciences perspective may be stated as follows: The attachment of microbes to interfaces is controlled by the macromolecular structure of the cell wall and the functional genes that are induced for its biological synthesis. Following logically from this is the view that diverse attached cell behaviour is mediated by the physical and chemical interactions of these macromolecules in the interfacial region and with other cells. This aspect can be reduced to its simplest form by treating physico-chemical interactions as colloidal forces acting between an isolated cell and a solid or pseudo solid substratum. These forces can be analysed by established methods rooted in DLVO (Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey and Overbeek) theory. Such a methodology provides little insight into what governs changes in the behaviour of the cell wall attached to surfaces, or indeed other cells. Nor does it shed any light on the expulsion of macromolecules that modify the interface such as formation of slime layers. These physical and chemical problems must be treated at the more fundamental level of the structure and behaviour of the individual components of the cell wall, for example biosurfactants and extracellular polysaccharides. This allows us to restate the above hypothesis in physical sciences terms: Cell attachment and related cell growth behaviour is mediated by <b>macromolecular</b> physics and <b>chemistry</b> in the interfacial environment. Ecological success depends on the genetic potential to favourably influence the interface through adaptation of the macromolecular structure. We present research that merges these two perspectives. This is achieved by quantifying attached cell growth for genetically diverse model organisms, building chemical models that capture the variations in interfacial structure and quantifying the resulting physical interactions. Experimental observations combine aqueous chemistry techniques with surface spectroscopy in order to elucidate the cell wall structure. Atomic force microscopy methods quantify the physical interactions between the solid substrata and key components of the cell wall such as macromolecular biosurfactants. Our current approach focuses on considering individually mycolic acids or longer chain polymers harvested from cells, as well as characterised whole cells. This approach allows us to use a multifactorial approach to address the relative impact of the individual components of the cell wall in contact with model surfaces. We then combine these components to increase complexity step-wise, while comparing with the behaviour of entire cells. Eventually, such an approach should allow us to estimate and understand the primary factors governing microbial cell adhesion. Although the work addresses the cell–mineral interface at a fundamental level, the research is driven by a range of technology needs. The initial rationale was improved prediction of contaminant degradation in natural environments (soils, sediments, aquifers) for environmental cleanup. However, this area of research addresses a wide range of biotechnology areas including improved understanding of pathogen survival (e. g., in surgical environments), better process intensification in biomanufacturing (biofilm technologies) and new product development...|$|R
