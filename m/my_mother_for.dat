Mao ordered Peng to be criticized for forty days for the [...] "failings" [...] of the Hundred Regiments Campaign (even though Mao had supported it, and afterwards praised its successes). Peng was not allowed to reply, and was forced to make a self-criticism. Privately, Peng resented Mao's criticism of him, and in 1959 once told Mao: [...] "At Yan'an, you fucked <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>for</b> forty days." ...|$|E

6000|$|So he ran in, {{filled with}} wonder and great gladness. But {{when he saw}} her who was waiting there, he laughed scornfully and said, 'Why, where is <b>my</b> <b>mother?</b> <b>For</b> I see none here but this vile beggar-woman.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{weary of}} those high titles whereof I have heard {{more than enough}} to-day. Call me Tua, O <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>for</b> so you have ever been to me, from whose breast I drew the milk of life." ...|$|E

[...] "Mrs. Raynor, {{who spends}} her summers {{in that house}} over there, is <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> Her brother is here, too, and she has some friends with her. Mother Anastasia was away {{recently}} on a little jaunt, {{and when she came}} back she said that I looked tired and wan, and that I ought to go to <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> <b>for</b> a fortnight. So I came. That was all simple enough, you see." ...|$|R

60|$|Then {{he said to}} his mother: 'Rest gently, <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>for</b> I go to make a {{home for}} myself and become a hero.' Then, {{entering}} his hut he took Nu-endo, his iron hammer, and throwing the sack over his shoulder, he went away.|$|E
60|$|Then would I seek <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>for</b> comfort. She was {{the more}} ready to give it because of her {{profound}} conviction that if I was found out—that is, if readers discovered how frequently and in how many guises she appeared in my books—the affair would become a public scandal.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mrs Finching {{has been}} telling me, sir,' said Arthur, after making his acknowledgments; the relict of the late Mr F. {{meanwhile}} protesting, with a gesture, against his use of that respectable name; 'that she hopes occasionally to employ the young needlewoman you recommended to <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> <b>For</b> which I have been thanking her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because it is unbearable--unbearable <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and <b>for</b> me, and <b>for</b> us all. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> {{thinks that}} some terrible thing has {{happened}} to the property; but if so, why should I not be told?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If your ladyship {{does not}} like Shakspeare, you will not quarrel with <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>for</b> being {{indifferent}} to him, too," [...] said George.

6000|$|... "I {{must say}} it, {{and say it}} with pleasure. Mrs. Norris is much better fitted than <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>for</b> having the charge of you now.

6000|$|... "Now I {{will ride}} on ahead, Annie, and prepare <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>for</b> your coming.

6000|$|If summer {{brings a}} flower so lovable [...] Of such a meditative restfulness [...] As this, {{with all her}} roses and carnations.

60|$|My throat ached with pity {{whenever}} I {{received a}} letter from <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>for</b> she never failed to express a growing longing for her sons, neither of whom could be with her. To do our chosen work a residence in the city was necessary, and so it came about that all my victories, all my small successes were shadowed by my mother's failing health and loneliness.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} take off <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> {{bracelet}} <b>for</b> {{a gift from}} a man I never knew," [...] she said. [...] "I hate diamonds. I wish those who like such things might have them." ...|$|R
60|$|Next morning I confessed {{everything}} to <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> and, <b>for</b> several months afterwards, was a reformed character. Indeed, the pendulum of my conscience swung too far the other way, and I grew exaggeratedly remorseful and unhealthily moral.|$|R

60|$|I {{have your}} sweet letter about Ulysses, the leaves, and the Robins. I have been feeling so wearily on this journey, the want of what--when I had it, I used--how often! {{to feel a}} burden--the claim of <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>for</b> at least a word, every day. Happy, poor mother, with two lines--and I--sometimes--nay--often--thinking it hard to have to stay five minutes from what I wanted to do--to write them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot admit," [...] he said, [...] "that I {{did wrong}} in forgetting <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>for</b> that fateful {{quarter of an}} hour.

6000|$|Aline shrugged her shoulders. [...] "You {{had better}} ask Sir Ralph and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>for</b> their views about me, Albert. It {{is not for}} a maid {{to make her own}} marriage, but a valiant knight like {{yourself}} can manage your own affairs, Methought perhaps that you would have to tell us that the Fleming's fair daughter was to assist you in the management of the castle that her father has given you." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother's</b> demand <b>for</b> <b>my</b> {{presence}} did not arise--I soon learned--from any {{return of}} her malady, {{but from a}} desire for news of my courtship. [...] "Where's my new daughter? Why didn't you bring her?" [...] she demanded.|$|R
60|$|MY DEAR BOB,--Yours {{received}}. I {{have received}} a communication by same mail from <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> clamouring <b>for</b> news, which I must answer as soon as I've done this. Of course, I shall paint your game in lively colours.|$|R
