40|$|AbstractMinimally <b>invasive</b> {{percutaneous}} <b>treatment</b> robots {{have become}} a popular area in medical robotics. <b>Minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>treatments</b> {{are an important part}} of modern surgery; however percutaneous treatments are a difficult procedure for surgeons. They must carry out a procedure that has limited visibility, tool maneuverability and where the target and tissue surrounding it move because of the tool. Robot technology can overcome those limitations and increase the success of <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> percutaneous <b>treatment.</b> In this paper we will present a review of the current state-of-the-art in robotic insertion needle for <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>treatments,</b> focusing on the limitations and challenges still open for their use in clinical application...|$|R

50|$|Interventional {{oncology}} {{procedures are}} generally divided between diagnostic procedures that help obtain tissue diagnosis of suspicious neoplasms and therapeutic ones that aim to cure or palliate the tumour. Therapeutic interventional oncology procedures may be classified further into ablation techniques that destroy neoplastic tissues by delivery of {{some form of}} heat, cryo or electromagnetic energy and embolization techniques that aim to occlude the blood vessels feeding the tumour and thereby destroy it by means of ischemia. Both ablation and embolization techniques are <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>treatment,</b> i.e. they may be delivered through the skin (in a percutaneous way) {{without the need for}} any skin incisions or other form of open surgery. Hence, most treatments are nowadays offered as day case or outpatient appointments and patients may enjoy rapid recovery and minimal pain and discomfort with low rates of complications.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} long-term {{effectiveness and}} safety of conservative and <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> outpatient <b>treatments</b> for female stress urinary incontinence (SUI) through {{a review of the}} literature. Methods. PubMed was searched for reports on prospective clinical trials with at least 12 -month follow-up of <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>treatments,</b> pelvic floor rehabilitation, or pharmacotherapy in women with SUI. Each report was examined for long-term rates of effectiveness and safety. Results. Thirty-two clinical trial reports were included. Prospective long-term studies of pelvic floor rehabilitation were limited but indicated significant improvements with treatment adherence for at least 12 months. Poor initial tolerability with duloxetine resulted in substantial discontinuation. Most patients receiving transurethral radiofrequency collagen denaturation or urethral bulking agents reported significant long-term improvements, generally good tolerability, and safety. Conclusions. Conservative therapy is an appropriate initial approach for female SUI, but if therapy fails, radiofrequency collagen denaturation or bulking agents may be an attractive intermediate management step or alternative to surgery...|$|R
