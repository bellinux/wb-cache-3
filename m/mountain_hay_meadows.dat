40|$|Abstract. Trisetum flavescens has {{relatively}} {{wide distribution}} in the country, but seldom dominates in the communities. It has not been studied syntaxonomically so far. On the basis of 37 relevés the current analysis reveals that T. flavescens communities {{are related to the}} Arrhenatheretum elatioris association. While otherwise similar to the Central European Arrhenatheretum elatioris, {{a significant portion of the}} species composition belongs to the Balkan floristic elements. Additionally, the presence of many south affiliated species is observed. This finding ascertains a Central-Balkan variant of the association which has not been reported so far. Some of the ecological peculiarities of the studied sites in the Rhodopes are very similar to those of Triseto-Polygonion in Central Europe, but we have failed to find sufficient proofs for the presence of the alliance in Bulgaria. The studied vegetation has high floristic diversity. It is maintained as hay meadows. The conservation value of the Arrhenathreretum elatioris merits protection under the Habitats Directive by means of an extension of the definition of Habitat 6520 to include Arrhenatherion as well.

40|$|Cynosurion cristati grasslands are {{semi-natural}} habitats {{that have}} developed on mesotrophic soils with a good water supply and are found from the basal up to the mountain vegetation belts. Differences between the various communities of these grasslands in the European continent have not been fully investigated; in Italy, {{there is a lack}} of knowledge of the mesophilous pastures in the central and southern Apennines. In order to shed light on the Cynosurion <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> and grasslands in the central Apennines, we considered phytosociological data from the Lepini and Prenestini mountains (central Italy, Tyrrhenian sector) : 58 original releves and a synoptic table containing similar associations throughout the Italian peninsula were analysed using multivariate methods (hierarchical classifications and principal coordinates analysis). Two new associations were distinguished: Hordeum bulbosum meadows, grazed after being mown (Trifolio molinerii-Hordeetum bulbosi), and heavily grazed, unmown pastures with several thorny species (Centaureo calcitrapae-Lolietum perennis). Both these associations have been assigned to Cynosurion cristati, though they differ from the European coenoses owing to the presence of Festuco-Brometea and Helianthemetea guttati species. Further investigations are warranted to clarify the overall syntaxonomical position of the Italian coenoses in relation to the ecological and phytogeographic variations of Cynosurion, which are considered to be related to traditional land use in <b>mountain</b> agricultural systems. <b>Hay</b> <b>meadows,</b> which are important elements of landscape and biodiversity conservation, particularly feel the negative effects of land abandonment and land use change...|$|R

The research was conducted in several areas of Mures County. The studied grasslands were classified into two types of Natura 2000 habitats: 6510 Lowland hay meadows (Alopecurus pratensis, Sanguisorba officinalis) and 6520 <b>Mountain</b> <b>hay</b> <b>meadows.</b> The identified phytocoenosis belong to two plant associations: Arrhenatheretum elatioris Br. -Bl.

The analysis of data collected in the field reveals that the current state of conservation of the two types of habitat is good and very good. Habitats in a good and very good state of preservation is distinguish by a great floristic composition: approx. 100 - 150 cormophyte species with good and very good forage value.

The RDP 2014 - 2020 offers the possibility to include environmental benefits and externalities as elements that drive decision-making. Such benefits and externalities include the ecosystem services (ES) provided by farming practices in semi-natural ecosystems such as alpine pastures and <b>mountain</b> <b>hay</b> <b>meadows.</b> An approach based on ES is proposed to support and to account for AEC measures in the Autonomous Province of Trento, relying on decision models and scenario analysis.

The decision framework consists of livestock management and alpine grassland use; its objective is the sustainable production of fodder, compatible with conservation of grassland biodiversity. In addition to habitat for biodiversity, other ES such as water purification, aesthetic and recreation value will be considered in subsequent steps. The need for simplification and reliability, along with data scarcity, strongly limits the degree of sophistication and makes it challanging to create a tool, which is accurate and easy-to-use at the same time. </p...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the influence of cutting frequency, harvest season and nitrogen fertilization on yield and floristic composition of the herbage harvested from a mountain meadow. The meadow was divided into 22 plots, each receiving a different N P K fertilization treatment. The study lasted seven years, and during the first three years (1985 - 1987) each plot was harvested twice per year (June and September) according to a traditional harvest system, whereas in the years 1989 - 1991 each plot was harvested three times per year (spring, summer and autumn) following a more intensive harvest system. Nitrogen fertilizer favoured the development of the grasses in spring, thus reducing the proportion of legumes in the two cut harvest system, whereas grasses reached an advanced stage of maturity before the first cut in late June. However, the three cut harvest system entailed an earlier first cut in spring. As a result, the production of legume biomass was significantly increased both in the first cut and in the subsequent regrowths. No significant response in total herbage production to the N fertilizer was observed in the more intensive harvest system. Therefore, the three cut harvest system without nitrogen fertilization seemed to be the most suitable practice for the management of these botanically-complex mountain meadows. These results may contribute to design fertilization and management practices of <b>mountain</b> <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> to optimize their productivity and sustainability...|$|E

40|$|Nitrogen (N) {{deposition}} is a {{major threat}} to biodiversity of many habitats in the lowlands. In mountain habitats, however, the effect of N deposition on biodiversity is not well understood. Here, data from the biodiversity monitoring of Switzerland were used to investigate whether high N deposition is negatively related to species richness and community uniqueness of vascular plants and bryophytes in mountain grassland. The total species diversity, as well as the diversity of three subsets of species (i. e. oligotrophic species, eutrophic species and targeted grassland species according to conservation objectives of the Swiss authorities) were analyzed. Overall, the empirical data from the present study indicate that the currently expert-based range of the critical load of N deposition below which harmful effects on sensitive ecosystems should not occur (upper bound is currently at 20 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1) is set too large for <b>mountain</b> <b>hay</b> <b>meadows.</b> Negative relations between N deposition and species richness and community uniqueness in mountain grassland were found already at 10 – 15 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1. The results suggest that the negative effect of N deposition on plant diversity is mainly due to a decrease of oligotrophic plant species {{and to a lesser extent}} to an increase in eutrophic plant species. While for bryophytes, the decrease of community uniqueness is related to changes in both oligotrophic and eutrophic species. Furthermore, because plant species richness of target species for conservation was negatively related to N deposition, airborne N deposition is likely to defeat conservation efforts in mountain grassland...|$|E
40|$|A {{higher risk}} of future range losses {{as a result of}} climate change is {{expected}} {{to be one of the}} main drivers of extinction trends in vascular plants occurring in habitat types of high conservation value. Nevertheless, the impact of the climate changes of the last 60 years on the current distribution and extinction patterns of plants is still largely unclear. We applied species distribution models to study the impact of environmental variables (climate, soil conditions, land cover, topography), on the current distribution of 18 vascular plant species characteristic of three threatened habitat types in southern Germany: (i) xero-thermophilous vegetation, (ii) mesophilous mountain grasslands (<b>mountain</b> <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> and matgrass communities), and (iii) wetland habitats (bogs, fens, and wet meadows). Climate and soil variables were the most important variables affecting plant distributions at a spatial level of 10 × 10 km. Extinction trends in our study area revealed that plant species which occur in wetland habitats faced higher extinction risks than those in xero-thermophilous vegetation, with the risk for species in mesophilous mountain grasslands being intermediary. For three plant species characteristic either of mesophilous mountain grasslands or wetland habitats we showed exemplarily that extinctions from 1950 to the present day have occurred at the edge of the species’ current climatic niche, indicating that climate change has likely been the main driver of extinction. This is largely consistent with current extinction trends reported in other studies. Our study indicates that the analysis of past extinctions is an appropriate means to assess the impact of climate change on species and that vulnerability to climate change is both species- and habitat-specific...|$|E
40|$|In the drier {{regions of}} the European Alps, {{traditional}} land-use of montane and subalpine meadows, i. e. extensively managedwith solid manure application and irrigation via water channels, is currently shifting towards application of slurry and aerialirrigation. The impact of these new practices upon biodiversity remains poorly understood and calls for quantitative assessmentsof their effects. Relying on a full block design, we tested the effects of six management treatments corresponding to an increasinggradient of farming intensification (fertilisation with slurry and/or irrigation with sprinklers) on Auchenorrhyncha (Hemiptera) communities occurring in the inner Swiss Alps. The experimental set up consisted of: control plots (no fertiliser, no irrigation;C-plots); plots that received only fertiliser (F-plots); plots that were only irrigated (I-plots); and plots that received low-, medium-and high-input of fertiliser and water (F + I 1 / 3 -plots; F + I 2 / 3, F + I 3 / 3 -plots; 3 / 3 corresponds here to the input level necessaryfor achieving maximum theoretical hay yield locally). After two years of experimental treatment (2012), plots that were onlyfertilised or only irrigated showed {{no change in the}} population sizes of Auchenorrhyncha, while plots that received low-, medium-and high-input of fertiliser and water harboured significantly higher abundances (1. 9, 1. 5 and 1. 4 times higher, respectively),biomass (1. 8, 1. 6 and 1. 8 times higher, respectively), as well as species richness (+ 27 – 30 %, on average) than control plots. Abundances and species richness were also higher in plots with low-input of fertiliser and water compared to fertilised onlyplots. Monophagous and oligophagous species were most abundant in plots with low-input of fertiliser and water. Medium- andhigh-input treatments (F + I 2 / 3 and 3 / 3) increased the number of generalist (eurytopic) species, while only low-input treatment(F + I 1 / 3) boosted the more specialised (stenotopic) species.

What {{are the main}} environmental gradients that drive patterns of species composition? Is it possible to classify these grasslands to phytosociological alliances that reflect management practices? Location: Western and Central Europe (excluding the Alps and Carpathians). Methods: A database of 21 400 vegetation plots of mesic grasslands across Western and Central Europe was compiled. After geographically stratified resampling, semi-supervised classification based on the K-means algorithm was applied to assign a subset of plots into 32 a priori association-level vegetation types and to search for new types within the subset of non-assigned plots. The vegetation plots assigned into the final vegetation types were submitted to another K-means classification to show the grouping into higher-level vegetation types. Results: A total of 36 associations were distinguished in the resampled subset of 8277 vegetation plots and were grouped into four large groups: (1) eutrophic and intensively managed <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> and permanent pastures; (2) nutrient-rich grasslands developed from recently abandoned fields or managed under irregular practices of mowing and manuring; (3) non-eutrophic lowland and submontane hay meadows; (4) extensively managed pastures and Atlantic grazed <b>hay</b> <b>meadows.</b> A PCoA of the associations of these four groups showed that extensively managed pastures were floristically more similar to non-eutrophic <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> than to permanent intensively managed pastures, which was more obvious in the Atlantic region than in Central Europe. Species composition of the lowland <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> was clearly differentiated according to biogeographic sectors. Other floristic differences were related to climate, altitude, soil base status and topography. Conclusions: This analysis challenges the traditional concept of mesic grassland alliances separating <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> from pastures. New classification should be based mainly on the differences in management intensity rather than in management practice. Consequently, nutrient-poor extensive pastures, which currently are not considered in the European Habitats Directive, should receive the same conservation attention as low-intensive <b>hay</b> <b>meadows,</b> because both types of vegetation can be equally species-rich and do not differ substantially in floristic composition from each other...|$|R

Interrelationships between the landscape and vegetation were revealed by combining research at three hierarchical levels, i. e. the landscape, biotope and species levels. A descriptive and analytical technique based on CIR aerial photo interpretation was developed for the landscape mesoscale. The historical background of the landscape and former biotope patterns were described, since traditional and sustained management is an important parameter in the landscape ecological analysis.
