40|$|Australian cotton is {{well known}} for its high and {{consistent}} quality, although agronomy, physiology and breeding research continues to ensure Australian cotton stays competitive from a quality standpoint. The testing of fiber in yarn and fabric form means the selection of new cultivars and field treatments is based on outcomes important to the end user. Such field experimentation inevitably produces large numbers of small (< 1 kg) lint samples that need to be processed through to yarn and fabric. To meet this need, an alternative miniature spinning system which is actually a hybrid spinning system was created utilizing a combination of the ‘Shirley ’ miniature spinning plant and industrial-scale spinning machinery. This process uses the miniature system for carding and a single drawing passage, while industrial-scale machinery are employed for a second draw passage, the creation of twisted roving and ring spinning. The experimental sample required for this protocol is small, being only 170 g. This study showed that {{there was no significant difference}} between industrial-scale and the new hybrid miniature spinning system for yarn strength for both Upland and Pima cotton, although the miniature spinning protocol produced yarns that were less even. We conclude that this miniature spinning system is adequate for assessing the strength of <b>medium</b> <b>count,</b> carded ring spun yarns manufactured from small amounts of lint...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Samples of {{groundwater}} and the enclosing sediments were com-pared for densities of bacteria using direct (acridine orange direct staining) and viable (growth on 1 % PTYG <b>medium)</b> <b>count</b> methodology. Sediments {{to a depth}} of 550 m were collected from boreholes at three sites on the Savannah River Site near Aiken, South Carolina, using techniques to insure a minimum of surface contamination. Clusters of wells screened at discreet intervals were established ateach site. Bacterial densities in sediment were higher, by both direct and viable count, than in groundwater samples. Differences between direct and viable counts were much greater for ground-water samples than for sediment samples. Densities of bacteria in sediment ranged from less than 1. 00 x 106 bacteria/g dry weight (gdw) up to 5. 01 x 10 s bacteria/gdw for direct counts, while viable counts were less than 1. 00 x 103 CFU/gdw to 4. 07 x 107 CFU/gdw. Bacterial densities in ground-waterwere 1. 00 x 103 - 6. 31 x 104 bacteria/ml and 5. 75 [...] 4. 57 x 102 CFU/ ml for direct and viable counts, respectively. Isolates from sediment were also found to assimilate a wider variety of carbon compounds than ground-water bacteria. The data suggest that oligotrophic aquifer sediments have unique and dense bacterial communities that are attached and not reflected in groundwater found in the strata. Effective in situ bioremediation of contamination in these aquifers may require sampling and characterization of sediment communities...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to analyse}} {{the changes in}} the hand weaving {{industry}} in South India, especially in Tamil districts under British rule. The bulk import of British cotton products into India in the nineteenth century seriously hit the hand weaving of white men's clothes with its high count yarns for the urban consumption; but the production of rough cloth for the rural population and of clothing for women, especially that of high quality, did not suffer so seriously. After the 1920 s, the cotton mills in India rapidly increased their production of cloth, which caused serious competition with the handloom products made of <b>medium</b> <b>count</b> yarn. Many handloom weavers were forced to adapt by shifting their products to, i) coloured cloth using high count yarns, silk threads and gold threads (zari) for upper-class consumers, ii) coloured cloths woven with artificial silk yams and mercerized yarns demanded by the lower-class rural people for ceremonial occasions, iii) coloured cloth for export, and iv) rough cloths for labouring women. It {{is important to note that}} changes in the variety of the handloom products were not only influenced by the competition from mill products, but also by the changes in clothing fashions for each class of people. Some changes brought about an increase in the demand for the mill products: a reduction in the number of people wearing Angave-stram and turbans; the increasing use of shirts and hosiery products, and of drill shorts in place of dhotis; the popularization of mill made light-coloured sarees among the middle-class young ladies in urban areas, etc. On the other hand, there were also some important trends which caused an increase in the demand for the handloom products: the increasing use of the bodice by women, which increased the demand for Madras Kaili production; the increasing use of cloth in general by lower-class people including depressed-caste people, especially that of artificial silk sarees for ceremonial occasions. Our interviews in some hand weaving centres reveal that the lower-class people who used to demand artificial silk sarees are now gradually purchasing a low-quality, cheaper variety of silk sarees for ceremonial occasions...|$|E
40|$|Authors: Graham Anderson and Eric J. Jenkinson Corresponding author ([G. Anderson@bham. ac. uk](G. Anderson@bham. ac. uk)) ### INTRODUCTION The {{generation}} of functionally competent T-cells from their progenitors involves {{a series of}} developmental events including proliferation, differentiation, and survival. T-cell development is a non-cell-autonomous event, and requires interactions with thymic stromal cells. Fetal thymus organ cultures provide an in vitro system in which isolated embryonic thymus lobes can be maintained in culture, allowing the study of T-cell development as well as thymic stromal cell function. This system remains the only in vitro system that supports a complete program of T-cell development, including positive and negative selection of the developing T-cell receptor repertoire. Modifications of the basic fetal thymus organ culture system, such as hanging drop cultures and reaggregate thymus organ cultures, provide useful systems to analyze thymus colonization and thymic stromal cell function, respectively. ### MATERIALS **Reagents** *All media should be prewarmed to 37 °C before use*. 1. 10 % CO 2 in air, contained in gas cylinder - 2 ′-deoxyguanosine (dGuo) (Sigma-Aldrich, D 0901) - *Prepare a 9 mM stock in 1 X PBS. It takes ~ 1 h at 37 ºC for the dGuo to dissolve. Mix the solution well during this period. Dilute the dGuo stock to a final concentration of 1. 35 mM in 1 X PBS (see Step 3) *. - Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) for thymus organ culture - 70 % ethanol - Mice, pregnant female (gestational age E 14 -E 16) - 1 X PBS (Ca++/Mg++-free) - RF 10 -H medium - 10 X trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, T 4674) - *Prepare a 1 X trypsin solution by diluting the 10 X stock in Ca++/Mg++-free PBS containing 0. 02 % EDTA*. ### Equipment 1. Artiwrap sponges, 1 cm 2 (Medipost Ltd.) - Aspirator tube assembly (Sigma-Aldrich, A 5177) - Boxes (rectangular, plastic) with fitted lids (Watkins and Doncaster, E 6052) - Bunsen burner, fish-tail - Filters (isopore membrane) with 0. 8 -μm pore size (Millipore, ATTP 01300) - Forceps, watchmaker, Dumont # 5 (TAAB) - Incubator, preset to 37 °C - Microcentrifuge - Microcentrifuge tubes, 1. 5 mL - Micropipette, 1 mL - Microscope (stereo-dissecting) with magnification range 0. 8 X- 5 X (e. g., Zeiss, Stemi SV) - Petri dishes, 90 -mm diameter, sterile bacteriological grade (Sterilin) - Plate inserts for multiwell plates (e. g., for a six-well plate, use Millicell 0. 4 -μm plate inserts; Millipore, PICM 03050) (optional; see Step 2. i) - Plates, Terasaki (Sterilin) - Scissors, surgical - Tape - Tubing, glass, to make capillary pipettes (Fisher Scientific UK, FB 51460) - Vortex mixer ### METHOD The standard fetal thymus organ culture (FTOC) method described in Steps 1 and 2 can be modified to study thymus colonization using hanging drop cultures (Steps 3 - 5; Jenkinson et al. 1982). In addition, reaggregate thymus organ cultures (RTOC) can be used, in which three-dimensional organ cultures are generated from defined mixtures of thymic stromal cells and thymocytes (Steps 6 - 16). This latter method is particularly useful in studying thymic stromal cell function {{and the development of}} an individual cohort of thymocytes at a defined developmental stage. **Fetal Thymus Organ Culture (FTOC) ** 1. To dissect fetal thymus lobes: - i. Swab the abdominal region of a sacrificed female mouse using 70 % ethanol. Reflect the skin using scissors and forceps, and cut through the abdominal wall to reveal the uterus. Separate the uterus from its attachments at the two uterine horns laterally, and from the bladder anteriorly. - ii. Transfer the uterus to a 90 -mm Petri dish. Using scissors and forceps, cut open the uterus lengthwise to remove the embryos. - iii. Place the embryos in a Petri dish containing 1 X PBS to wash off any blood. Use forceps to remove the placenta and membranes from each embryo. - iv. Place the embryos in a Petri dish containing RF 10 -H medium. Decapitate the embryos by pinching them with forceps just below the chin. Place each embryo on its back, and open the anterior surface of the chest wall by placing the tips of a closed pair of forceps into the chest cavity and allowing the forceps to open. - v. Under the dissecting microscope, remove the entire thoracic tree [...] heart, lungs, trachea, thymus lobes [...] by grasping below the heart. Place the thoracic trees in a Petri dish containing fresh RF 10 -H medium. *See Troubleshooting*. - vi. Check each tree for the presence of the two thymus lobes. Remove the thymus lobes from the thoracic tree using forceps. - *Thymus lobes appear as oval encapsulated organs {{on either side of the}} trachea (Fig. 1). See Troubleshooting*. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1 **. Position of the fetal thymus lobes in the thorax. (a) When the embryo is placed on its back and the anterior chest wall is opened, the two thymus lobes can be seen lying above the heart (H, heart; L, liver). (b) These lobes can be individually dissected as encapsulated organs. 2. To prepare fetal thymus organ cultures: - i. Place 4 mL of prewarmed DMEM in a 90 -mm Petri dish, and use forceps to place two 1 -cm 2 Artiwrap sponges and two 0. 8 -μm filters into the dish. Make sure that the medium wets the filters from below. - *See Troubleshooting. As an alternative to the sponge-and-filter method, multiwell plate inserts with membranes of the appropriate pore size can be used*. - ii. Prepare a finely drawn glass pipette by heating the glass tubing in a Bunsen flame, and allow the pipette to cool before attaching to the aspirator tube. - iii. Using a mouth-controlled glass pipette from Step 2. ii, pick up the thymus lobes individually and transfer them to the surface of the filters. - *See Troubleshooting. As an alternative approach to the glass pipette method, fine forceps can be used*. - iv. Place up to three 90 -mm Petri dishes into a plastic rectangular box containing H 2 O and a Petri dish lid as a support. Gas the boxes for 10 min with a mixture of 10 % CO 2 in air, seal with tape, and incubate at 37 ºC. - *The length of incubation depends on the experiment; it is typically 5 - 10 d. See Troubleshooting*. **Hanging Drop Cultures** 3. Isolate and set up in organ culture E 14 -E 15 fetal thymus lobes as described in Steps 1 and 2. To eliminate endogenous thymocytes from the lobes, grow organ cultures in the presence of 1. 35 mM 2 ′-deoxyguanosine (dGuo) at 37 °C for 5 - 7 d (Jenkinson et al. 1982). 4. Resuspend the thymocyte population of interest (e. g., fetal liver T-cell progenitors, CD 4 − 8 − thymocyte subsets) in 20 μL of prewarmed DMEM, and transfer the cell(s) to a single Terasaki well. The number of the transferred cells at the outset of culture can be as few as one per well, but is typically around 2000. Place a single dGuo-treated lobe in each well, and invert the plate by turning it over, so that the medium forms a hanging drop in the plate. 5. Culture overnight, as for FTOC (see Step 2. iv). Colonized lobes can then be removed from the Terasaki plate and analyzed immediately to study thymus colonization, or transferred to normal FTOC to reveal the developmental potential of the introduced cells. **Reaggregate Thymus Organ Cultures (RTOC) ** 6. Prepare dGuo-treated FTOC (see Step 3), and transfer the lobes to a dish of prewarmed RF 10 -H medium. 7. Using a 1 -mL micropipette, transfer the lobes to a 1. 5 -mL microcentrifuge tube with no more than 20 lobes per tube, and allow them to sink to the bottom. 8. Remove the medium, and wash the lobes three times in 1 -mL volumes of prewarmed 1 X PBS. 9. Resuspend the lobes in 600 μL of prewarmed 1 X trypsin solution, and incubate the lobes at 37 ºC for 10 min. 10. Pipette the lobes using a 1 -mL micropipette, and return them to the incubator for an additional 5 min. 11. Pipette the lobes again until they completely disperse. Neutralize the trypsin by adding 400 μL of RF 10 -H medium. Centrifuge and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of RF- 10 H <b>medium.</b> <b>Count</b> the cells. *See Troubleshooting*. 12. Mix together appropriate numbers of thymocytes and stromal cells in a 1. 5 -mL microcentrifuge tube, and centrifuge. - *To prepare RTOC, thymic stromal cells obtained as above need to be mixed with the desired thymocyte population (Jenkinson et al. 1992). In a typical experiment, ~ 7. 5 × 10 e 5 thymic stromal cells can be mixed with 7. 5 × 10 e 5 CD 4 + 8 + thymocytes*. 13. Remove the supernatant from the cell pellet. - *It is essential that all of the liquid is removed from the cell pellet prior to reaggregation*. 14. Vortex the cell pellet for 5 sec. - *This disrupts the pellet and forms a thick cell slurry*. 15. Using a mouth-controlled glass pipette (from Step 2. ii), transfer the slurry to the center of a 0. 8 -μm filter in a Petri dish. - *Where mouth pipetting is not possible, the cell slurry can be drawn up into a small pipette tip using a hand-controlled micropipette, and gently expelled onto the filter surface. See Troubleshooting*. 16. Culture as for standard FTOC (see Step 2. iv). ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: When removing the thoracic tree from the embryos, thymus lobes are left in the chest cavity. **[Step 1. v]** - **Solution**: It is important to grasp the heart (a red, apple-shaped organ) firmly. Sharp straight forceps also help; if forceps are blunt or bent, fine dissection is difficult. - **Problem**: Instruments become sticky with congealed blood and tissue during the preparation of large numbers of embryos, making it difficult to manipulate dissected lobes. **[Step 1. vi]** - **Solution**: Wash the instruments regularly with 70 % alcohol and allow them to air-dry before use. - **Problem**: Large areas of the bottom of the Petri dish are not covered by medium. **[Step 2. i]** - **Solution**: Make sure the volume of medium is accurate; insufficient medium in the dishes can adversely affect organ cultures. This may also be due to sponge supports that are too large and consequently soak up the medium. - **Problem**: Filters slip off the sponge supports and sink. **[Step 2. i]** - **Solution**: Adding too much medium to the Petri dish increases the depth of the medium, which can cause filters to float off their support and sink. Make sure the volume of medium is accurate. Also, use sponge supports that are larger in area than the filters. - **Problem**: A large volume of medium is transferred to the filter during the placement of lobes on the filter. **[Step 2. iii]** - **Solution**: Use a fine mouth-controlled glass pipette to transfer the lobes. The diameter of the glass pipette should be approximately half the size of the thymus lobe. If forceps are used, medium is easily transferred to the filter, which can submerge the lobes. - **Problem**: Explanted lobes fuse together during culture. **[Step 2. iv]** - **Solution**: Leave enough space between explanted lobes to allow for growth. Place no more than six lobes on each filter, and arrange the lobes like the dots on a die. - **Problem**: dGuo-treated thymus lobes do not digest completely in trypsin. **[Step 11]** - **Solution**: It is important to digest the lobes in small batches (typically 20 lobes) rather than as one large batch. If they are not digested completely after 15 min, transfer the lobes back to 37 ºC for an additional 5 min. - **Problem**: When making RTOC, the cell slurry spreads out on the filter surface and intact lobes fail to form. **[Step 15]** - **Solution**: If even a small volume (2 μL) of liquid is left on the cell pellet prior to reaggregation, the slurry is too thin and will spread out. During Step 13, remove the supernatant in stages using a micropipette set at 200 μL. ### DISCUSSION The use of isolated thymus lobes between E 14 and E 16 is optimal for fetal thymus organ culture. Thymus lobes after E 16 of gestation are large, a factor that often can lead to considerable necrosis in the explanted tissue. Maintaining the organ cultures in a 4 -mL volume of culture medium allows the cultures to be kept for several weeks without the need for replacement of the spent medium. While cultures can be maintained in CO 2 incubators, the use of sealed tissue culture boxes that are individually gassed results in cultures that are unaffected by repeated openings of incubator doors. Humidity is also maintained, which helps prevent evaporation of the medium in longer-term cultures; thus, fetal thymus organ cultures can be maintained in these culture conditions for several weeks. As a general rule, if E 15 fetal lobes are explanted, maturation from the CD 4 − 8 − to the CD 4 + 8 + stage is readily detectable after 4 d in culture. Cohorts of CD 4 + 8 − and CD 4 − 8 + cells first appear around days 7 - 8 of culture, and can be used to study selection events operating on CD 4 + 8 + thymocytes. For reaggregate thymus organ culture, the number of dGuo FTOC lobes used depends upon the experiment being performed. Typically, in order to study the positive selection of a cohort of CD 4 + 8 + thymocytes, we would use 10 - 15 E 15 dGuo FTOCs to generate a singe RTOC, and harvest after 5 d of culture, when cohorts of CD 4 + 8 − and CD 4 − 8 + cells are detectable.

Most samples were negative in coliform test, except five samples had coliform MPN ranging from 0. 5 /g. to 0. 8 /g. A total of 144 isolates of psychrophiles from 12 samples was tentatively identified {{to be members of}} Staphylococcus species. About 82. 2 % of the isolates belong to the Subgroup VI Staphylococcus according to Baird-Parker's classification. Another 17. 8 % of the isolates resembled Subgroup VI Staphylococcus except in phosphatase test...|$|R

In {{view of its}} success, Dr. Fehrer then created the DREF 3, which was designed for the <b>medium</b> yarn <b>count</b> range and made its debut at the ITMA ’79 in Hanover, before entering serial production in 1981.|$|R
30|$|The Adaptive Transmission Power (ATP) {{protocol}} {{presented in}} [21] {{is based on}} nodes listening to the <b>medium</b> and <b>counting</b> the collisions that occur in this period. Depending on this value {{and the number of}} neighbours, a node decreases or increases its transmission power appropriately. In [21], the threshold for the number of neighbours is set to 30, when this value is exceeded the transmit power is controlled using ATP.|$|R
30|$|Bacterial {{contamination}} {{upon the}} opening of injection needles was examined in two materials, paper and plastic. Various concentrations of Staphylococcus aureus were applied to the mount and were maintained under wet or dry conditions. Injection needles were opened using the peel-apart or push-off top method. Needle hub contamination was examined using agar <b>medium</b> colony <b>counting.</b> Clinically assumed conditions (the hands and saliva of anesthesiologists) were also evaluated. Data were statistically examined using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel, Jonckheere, and Fisher’s exact tests.|$|R

This idea substantiated by gamma ray observations led {{to the discovery of}} nearby molecular cloud complexes. The reddening studies indicate that one of them lies between 80 and 140 pc from the Sun. From CO observations, its molecular mass is estimated to be a few 1000 stellar mass units...|$|R
40|$|Spirochetes are {{markedly}} {{prevalent in}} periodontal disease {{but are not}} included as predominant cultivable organisms because of the inability to quantify them by viable count. A successful method was developed for enumerating viable oral spirochetes in pure culture as colony-forming units (CFU) in new oral spirochete (NOS) medium with 0. 7 % agarose and using small tissue-culture flasks. Three species of oral spirochetes in log-phase growth in NOS broth were used for evaluation of the method. Reliable, consistent and reproducible viable counts of pure spirochete cultures were obtained. This method was extended to enumerate viable oral spirochetes from periodontal pockets. The antibiotic rifampin (20 $ mu$g/ml) {{was found to be}} an excellent selective agent for such a count when added to NOS-agarose <b>medium.</b> <b>Counts</b> of cultivable oral spirochetes from 10 subgingival plaque samples ranged from 12. 5 % to 28. 2 % of the total cultivable anaerobic bacteria. In addition, by the use of this method thirteen new oral spirochetes were isolated. The viable count technique was modified and employed to study the locomotion of spirochetes. Migration of oral spirochetes out of NOS-Bacto agar medium into NOS-agarose medium was observed and two locomotory phenotypes of oral spirochetes were detected...|$|R

The method is based on limited multiplication of A. brasilense in convential semi-solid <b>medium</b> and <b>counting</b> of the bacteria in the enriched medium by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or by Most Probable Number (MPN) techniques. The method {{can be used as a}} complementary procedure to ELISA and MPN techniques when low numbers of A. brasilense are present in the roots...|$|R
40|$|Background Pretreatment {{platelet}} count {{has been reported}} as a potential tool to predict survival outcome in several solid tumors. However, the predictive value of pretreatment {{platelet count}} remains obscure in de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia (M 3). Methods We conducted a retrospective review of 209 patients with de novo non-M 3 AML in our institute {{over a period of}} 8 years (2007 – 2015). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the optimal platelet (PLT) cutoff in patients. We analyzed the overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) using the log-rank test and Cox regression analysis. Results By defining the platelet count 50 ×  109 /L and 120 ×  109 /L as two cut-off points, we categorized the patients into three groups: low (120 ×  109 /L). On univariate analysis, patients with <b>medium</b> platelet <b>count</b> had longer OS and DFS than those with low or high platelet count. However, the multivariate analysis showed that only longer DFS was observed in patients with <b>medium</b> platelet <b>count</b> than those with low or high platelet count. Conclusion Our findings indicate that pretreatment platelet count has a predictive value for the prognosis of patients with non-M 3 AML...|$|R
