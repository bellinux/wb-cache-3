40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> {{control of a}} low-speed vehicle. Several topics are studied in detail: (1) vehicle error-state model for <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> based on Ackerman steering and (2) <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> control of a low-speed vehicle using fuzzy logic. Independently written research papers address each topic. The first paper presents a second order 2 ̆ 2 error-state 2 ̆ 2 kinematic model based on Ackerman steering appropriate for studying the <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> control of low-speed vehicles traversing on roads of constant curvature. <b>Lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> control of vehicles is {{of great interest to}} the Advanced Vehicle Control Systems (AVCS) Division of the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) community. Both linear and nonlinear models are derived in detail. The error states considered are the vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s lateral error and heading error measured with respect to the instantaneous road centerline tangent. In addition to the derivation, both simulation and experimental results are presented with very good correspondence being achieved. The second paper investigates the performance of several different controllers used to perform <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> control of a low-speed vehicle described as a linear nonminimum-phase 2 ̆ 2 error-state 2 ̆ 2 bicycle model based on Ackerman steering. Both a conventional type I proportional-integral (PI) controller and a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) are considered. The PI controller is designed using standard techniques and the two-level FLC / PI controller adjusts both proportional and integral feedback control gains around the baseline values based on heuristics and the current conditions as measured by the lateral error. Time-based simulations using MATLAB / SIMULINK permit a comparison between both controllers for several different simulation scenarios of interest. Primary performance metrics considered were percent overshoot and settling time in response to a step input. In general, the two-level FLC / PI controller performed better; 6...|$|R

40|$|A <b>lateral</b> entry <b>guidance</b> is {{designed}} based on azimuth error and crossrange error for a low L/D ratio lunar return vehicle. The conventional technique {{to determine the}} bank sign is according to the crossrange error, which might cause large crossrange deviation during Kepler phase if azimuth error at skip out point is large. This paper develops a combined <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> logic to minish accumulate crossrange error caused by azimuth error during Kepler phase. The lateral logic decides the value of crossrange threshold by constantly predicting the crossrange at skip out point. The azimuth error at skip out point is regulated to a small value by only one bank reverse through online adjusting reversal threshold. The effect of earth rotation is compensated by moving the landing site to opposite direction. During the second entry, the lateral logical {{is designed}} based on the crossrange error to achieve precise lateral control. The <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> logic is validated by numerical simulations. Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> logic can deliver the vehicle to the desired landing site {{in the presence of}} large initial dispersions and disturbance. </p...|$|R
40|$|A <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> {{algorithm}} {{which controls}} {{the location of}} the line of intersection between the actual and desired orbital planes (the hinge line) is developed for the aerobraking phase of a lift-modulated orbital transfer vehicle. The on-board targeting algorithm associated with this <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> algorithm is simple and concise which is very desirable since computation time and space are limited on an on-board flight computer. A variational equation which describes the movement of the hinge line is derived. Simple relationships between the plane error, the desired hinge line position, the position out-of-plane error, and the velocity out-of-plane error are found. A computer simulation is developed to test the <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> algorithm for a variety of operating conditions. The algorithm does reduce the total burn magnitude needed to achieve the desired orbit by allowing the plane correction and perigee-raising burn to be combined in a single maneuver. The algorithm performs well under vacuum perigee dispersions, pot-hole density disturbance, and thick atmospheres. The results for many different operating conditions are presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were (i) to compare the reproducibility of lateral tooth contacts of casts mounted in a semi-adjustable articulator when condylar guidance was set by different methods and (ii) to assess the margin of error of the variations of condylar <b>guidance</b> without changing <b>lateral</b> tooth contacts, {{depending on the type of}} <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance.</b> In subjects with different types of <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance,</b> intraoral <b>lateral</b> tooth contacts identified with occlusal registration strips were compared with those identified by use of a semi-adjustable articulator, setting the condylar guidance in four different ways: using protrusive wax wafers, by axiography and by adding and subtracting 5 degrees from the value of condylar guidance obtained by protrusive wax wafers. Tolerance to variations of condylar <b>guidance</b> without changing <b>lateral</b> tooth contacts was determined by increasing and decreasing the value of condylar <b>guidance</b> until <b>lateral</b> tooth contacts changed. Different ways of setting condylar guidance on a semi-adjustable articulator give rise to different values of condylar guidance in the same subject. The occlusal repercussions of these variations of condylar guidance values depend on the type of <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance.</b> Canine protection had the greatest tolerance to variations in the setting of condylar <b>guidance</b> without changing <b>lateral</b> occlusal contacts...|$|R

40|$|A {{variable}} look-ahead controller for the <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> {{of vehicles}} for Automated Highway Systems is proposed. The control {{objective is to}} make the lateral error at a certain point ahead of the vehicle zero. The distance of this point from the vehicle is called the look-ahead distance. An input-output linearization controller to achieve this objective is proposed. It is shown that the yaw internal dynamics can be damped at all longitudinal velocities if the look-ahead distance is a certain quadratic function of the longitudinal velocity. 1 This work was supported by California PATH (Partners for Advanced Transit and Highways) Program. 1 Introduction This paper presents a lateral controller for four wheeled vehicles in the context of Automated Vehicle Systems (AHS). The earliest research in the automated lateral control of vehicles took place in early 1960 's and 1970 's (Gardels, 1960, Fenton, 1976).

50|$|Lateral {{navigation}} (LNAV) {{refers to}} navigating over a ground track with guidance from an electronic device {{that gives the}} pilot (or autopilot) error indications in the lateral direction only {{and not in the}} vertical direction. In aviation, lateral navigation is one of two guidance types: linear guidance and angular guidance. In linear guidance, the aircraft's deviation to the left or right of the desired ground track is given as a distance between the aircraft's current position and the desired track. In angular guidance, the error indication is given in degrees of angle from the desired line relative to a ground-based navigation device. To provide an illustration, as the aircraft approaches the ground device with a constant angular error, its distance to the desired ground line decreases. In the context of aviation instrument approaches, an LNAV approach (one that uses lateral navigation) is implied to be a GPS-based approach and to have linear <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance.</b> A VOR-based approach will have angular <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{design and}} {{performance}} evaluation of an entry guidance algorithm for future space transportation vehicles is presented. The guidance concept is {{to plan and}} track aerodynamic acceleration. This concept, on which the longitudinal entry guidance for the Space Shuttle Orbiter is based, is extended to integrated longitudinal and <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance.</b> With integrated longitudinal and <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance,</b> more extreme points in the landing footprint can be reached accurately; in particular, the cross-range capability is extended. The guidance algorithm consists of two components: a trajectory planner and a trajectory tracking law. The planner generates reference drag acceleration and heading angle profiles, along with reference state and bank angle profiles. The planner executes onboard and is capable of generating updates as the entry evolves. The tracking law, based on feedback linearization, commands the angles of bank and attack required to follow the reference drag and heading angle profiles. The planner and tracking law are described, along with additional higher level logic included in the algorithm. Extensive simulations {{for a set of}} return-from-orbit entries, including ones requiring large cross range, demonstrate that this algorithm consistently achieves the desired target conditions within allowable tolerances and satisfies all other entry constraints.

More significantly however it means the safety of the aircraft is still dependent on the ILS during rollout. Furthermore, as it taxis off the runway and down any parallel taxiway, it itself acts a reflector and can interfere with the localiser signal.
