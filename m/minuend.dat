25|$|Unlike addition, {{subtraction}} is not commutative, so {{the order}} of numbers in the operation will change the result. Therefore, each number is provided a different distinguishing name. The first number (5 in the previous example) is formally defined as the <b>minuend</b> and the second number (3 in the previous example) as the subtrahend. The value of the <b>minuend</b> {{is larger than the}} value of the subtrahend so that the result is a positive number, but a smaller value of the <b>minuend</b> will result in negative numbers.|$|E
25|$|Write the <b>minuend</b> (the {{largest number}} {{you want to}} diminish) and remove from it all the digits {{appearing}} in the subtrahend (the smallest number). In case the digit to be removed {{does not appear in}} the <b>minuend,</b> then borrow it by expanding the unit just larger. Repeat until all the digit of the subtrahend have been removed.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{of finding}} the {{difference}} digit by digit, one can count up the numbers between the subtrahend and the <b>minuend.</b>|$|E
50|$|Five {{subtraction}} {{problems for}} each heat, each problem having six- to eight-digit <b>minuends</b> and subtrahends. The soroban {{won in the}} first and third heats; the second heat was a no contest.|$|R
25|$|Formally, {{the number}} being {{subtracted}} {{is known as}} the subtrahend, while the number it is subtracted from is the <b>minuend.</b> The result is the difference.|$|E
25|$|The same change method {{uses the}} fact that adding or {{subtracting}} the same number from the <b>minuend</b> and subtrahend {{does not change the}} answer. One adds the amount needed to get zeros in the subtrahend.|$|E
25|$|The partial {{differences}} {{method is}} different from other vertical subtraction methods because no borrowing or carrying takes place. In their place, one places plus or minus signs {{depending on whether the}} <b>minuend</b> is greater or smaller than the subtrahend. The sum of the partial differences is the total difference.|$|E
25|$|As a final caution, the {{borrowing}} method gets a bit complicated {{in cases}} such as , where a borrow cannot be made immediately, and must be obtained by reaching across several columns. In this case, the <b>minuend</b> is effectively rewritten as , by taking a 100 from the hundreds, making ten 10s from it, and immediately borrowing that down to nine 10s in the tens column and finally placing a 10 in the ones column.|$|E
2500|$|Subtraction is {{the inverse}} of addition. Subtraction finds the {{difference}} between two numbers, the <b>minuend</b> [...] minus the subtrahend. If the <b>minuend</b> {{is larger than the}} subtrahend, the difference is positive; if the <b>minuend</b> is smaller than the subtrahend, the difference is negative; if they are equal, the difference is0.|$|E
2500|$|How [...] "Elegant" [...] works: In {{place of}} an outer [...] "Euclid loop", [...] "Elegant" [...] shifts {{back and forth}} between two [...] "co-loops", an A > B loop that computes A ← A − B, and a B ≤ A loop that computes B ← B − A. This works because, when at last the <b>minuend</b> M is {{less than or equal to}} the {{subtrahend}} S ( [...] Difference = <b>Minuend</b> − Subtrahend), the <b>minuend</b> can become s (the new measuring length) and the subtrahend can become the new r (the length to be measured); in other words the [...] "sense" [...] of the subtraction reverses.|$|E
2500|$|Subtraction is the {{mathematical}} operation which describes a reduced quantity. The {{result of this}} operation {{is the difference between}} two numbers, the <b>minuend</b> and the subtrahend. As with addition, subtraction can have a number of interpretations, such as: ...|$|E
2500|$|Subtraction {{is neither}} {{commutative}} nor associative. For that reason, {{it is often}} helpful to look at subtraction as addition of the <b>minuend</b> and {{the opposite of the}} subtrahend, that is [...] When written as a sum, all the properties of addition hold.|$|E
2500|$|To {{subtract}} {{a binary}} number y (the subtrahend) from another number x (the <b>minuend),</b> the ones' complement of y {{is added to}} x and one {{is added to the}} sum. The leading digit [...] "1" [...] of the result is then discarded.|$|E
2500|$|Subtraction {{of natural}} numbers is not closed. The {{difference}} {{is not a}} natural number unless the <b>minuend</b> is {{greater than or equal}} to the subtrahend. For example, 26 cannot be subtracted from 11 to give a natural number. Such a case uses one of two approaches: ...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>minuend</b> is 704, the {{subtrahend}} is 512. The <b>minuend</b> digits are , [...] and [...] The subtrahend digits are , [...] and [...] Beginning at the one's place, 4 is {{not less}} than 2 so the difference 2 is written down in the result's one's place. In the ten's place, 0 is less than 1, so the 0 is increased by 10, and the difference with 1, which is 9, is written down in the ten's place. The American method corrects for the increase of ten by reducing the digit in the minuend's hundreds place by one. That is, the 7 is struck through and replaced by a 6. The subtraction then proceeds in the hundreds place, where 6 is {{not less than}} 5, so the difference is written down in the result's hundred's place. We are now done, the result is 192.|$|E
2500|$|... {{where each}} s'i and m'i is a digit, {{proceeds}} by writing down , , and so forth, {{as long as}} s'i does not exceed m'i. Otherwise, m'i is increased by 10 and some other digit is modified to correct for this increase. The American method corrects by attempting to decrease the <b>minuend</b> digit m'i+1 by one (or continuing the borrow leftwards {{until there is a}} non-zero digit from which to borrow). The European method corrects by increasing the subtrahend digit s'i+1 by one.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{additions}} method, a 10 is borrowed to {{make the}} 6 into 16, {{in preparation for the}} subtraction of 9, just as in the borrowing method. However, the 10 is not taken by reducing the <b>minuend,</b> rather one augments the subtrahend. Effectively, the problem is transformed into [...] Typically a crutch of a small one is marked just below the subtrahend digit as a reminder. Then the operations proceed: 9 from 16 is 7; and 40 (that is, [...] ) from 80 is 40, or 47 as the result.|$|E
50|$|If {{there are}} not enough dots in a <b>minuend</b> position, a bar is {{replaced}} by five dots. If {{there are not}} enough bars, a dot is removed from the next higher <b>minuend</b> symbol in the column and four bars are added to the <b>minuend</b> symbol which is being worked on.|$|E
50|$|Subtraction is {{the inverse}} of addition. Subtraction finds the {{difference}} between two numbers, the <b>minuend</b> minus the subtrahend. If the <b>minuend</b> {{is larger than the}} subtrahend, the difference is positive; if the <b>minuend</b> is smaller than the subtrahend, the difference is negative; if they are equal, the difference is 0.|$|E

50|$|In quote notation, to subtract, just subtract. There are no sign or {{magnitude}} comparisons, and {{no common}} denominators. When a <b>minuend</b> digit {{is less than}} the corresponding subtrahend digit, do not borrow from the <b>minuend</b> digit to its left; instead, carry (add one) to the subtrahend digit to its left. Here are some examples.|$|E
50|$|Write the <b>minuend</b> (the {{largest number}} {{you want to}} diminish) and remove from it all the digits {{appearing}} in the subtrahend (the smallest number).

50|$|To {{multiply}} a sum (or difference) by a factor, each summand (or <b>minuend</b> and subtrahend) is {{multiplied by}} this factor {{and the resulting}} products are added (or subtracted).|$|E
5000|$|If the subtrahend, y, {{has fewer}} digits than the <b>minuend,</b> x, leading zeros must be {{added in the}} second method. These zeros become leading nines when the {{complement}} is taken. For example: ...|$|E
