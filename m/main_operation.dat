5|$|On {{the right}} {{flank of the}} 2nd Canadian Division, the 12th Canadian Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Division {{executed}} a diversionary operation which proved successful in drawing German retaliatory fire away from the <b>main</b> <b>operation.</b> Four hours later, the 11th Canadian Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Division attempted to exploit the weakened German force by pushing strong patrols towards the centre of Lens. This ultimately failed as the Germans used local counter-attacks across the 4th Canadian Division's front to drive the patrols back to the city's outskirts.|$|E
5|$|Operation Rösselsprung was a coup de <b>main</b> <b>operation,</b> {{involving}} {{direct action}} {{by a combined}} parachute and glider-borne assault by the 500th SS Parachute Battalion and a planned subsequent link-up with ground forces of the XV Mountain Corps converging on Drvar. The airborne assault was preceded by heavy bombing of the town by the Luftwaffe. The ground forces included Home Guard forces of the Independent State of Croatia. Tito, his principal headquarters staff and the Allied military personnel escaped, despite their presence in Drvar {{at the time of}} the airborne assault. The operation failed due to a number of factors, including Partisan resistance in the town itself and along the approaches to Drvar. The failure of the various German intelligence agencies to share the limited intelligence available on Tito's exact location and the lack of contingency planning by the commander of the German airborne force also contributed to the unsuccessful outcome for the Germans.|$|E

5|$|The 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division resumed Operation Martlet at 0650, {{although}} much of its artillery support from VIII Corps was diverted to the <b>main</b> <b>operation.</b> The Germans were able to slow the British advance and then launched an armoured riposte. This initially gained ground but was stalled when British armour moved up and the two sides duelled in the confined terrain. Informed during the afternoon that a big British offensive was under way further east, SS-Standartenführer Kurt Meyer of 12th SS Panzer called off the counter-attack and ordered his tank companies {{to return to their}} positions south of Rauray. During {{the rest of the day}} the 49th Division was able to make progress, eventually halting just north of Rauray.|$|E

While the <b>main</b> <b>operation</b> continued to use a variant of the red and ivory livery introduced in 1986, Red Admiral vehicles were painted into a red and black colour scheme. However, Citybus still faced strong competition from Southdown and People's Provincial, two former NBC subsidiaries which were now independent, and its finances were never entirely secure during its year of operation in this form.|$|E
25|$|Also {{prior to}} the passage of the Act, there were many relaxations to the Glass–Steagall Act. For example, a few years earlier, {{commercial}} Banks were allowed to pursue investment banking, and before that banks were also allowed to begin stock and insurance brokerage. Insurance underwriting was the only <b>main</b> <b>operation</b> they weren't allowed to do, something rarely done by banks even after the passage of the Act. The Act further enacted three provisions that allow for bank holding companies to engage in physical commodity activities. Prior to the enactment of the Act those activities were limited to those that were so closely related to banking to be considered incidental to it. Under GLBA depending on the provision the institution falls into, bank holding companies can engage in physical commodity trading, energy tolling, energy management services, and merchant banking activities.|$|E
25|$|The Allied forces {{participating}} in the operation were the U.S. First and Ninth Armies, assigned to Omar Bradley's 12th Army Group. The First Army's units for the operation consisted of the V and VII Corps, that latter assigned for the main thrust through the Hürtgen Forest, with V Corps protecting its southern flank. For the upcoming offensive, both armies were heavily reinforced. Total strength of the First Army rose from about 250,000 in September to about 320,000 before the offensive, although only about 120,000 troops would participate in the <b>main</b> <b>operation.</b> The First Army's tank strength was about 700 tanks. In October the Allies suffered from major supply shortcomings, but by early November those had been mostly resolved. The Ninth Army was somewhat smaller, consisting mainly of the XIX Corps and some independent divisions, with the XIII Corps in reorganization. As support for the ground operations, the Allies planned their largest tactical bombing of the war, employing more than 4,500 planes.|$|E

500|$|In April1944, {{under the}} command of 1st Airborne Corps, the brigade took part in Exercise Mush, in the {{counties}} of Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Wiltshire. This was an airborne military exercise spread over three days involving the 1st and 6th Airborne Divisions. Unknown to the men of the 6th Airborne, it was a full-scale rehearsal for the division's involvement in the imminent Normandy invasion. During the invasion, the division's two parachute brigades would land just after midnight on 6June, while the 6th Airlanding Brigade arrived later in the day just before dark. The division's objective was to secure the left flank of the invasion area, by dominating the high ground in the area between the rivers Orne and Dives. [...] For their part in the operation, the 5th Parachute Brigade had to capture intact the Caen Canal and the River Orne bridges. To assist the brigade in its mission, 'D' Company from the 2nd Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry was taken under its command to carry out a coup de <b>main</b> <b>operation</b> on the bridges.|$|E

The <b>main</b> <b>operation</b> began on 26 December with a naval barrage on the Japanese positions on Cape Gloucester by United States Navy (USN) and Royal Australian Navy (RAN) warships from Task Force 76, followed by air attacks by planes from the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). These attacks and an aerial smoke screen were followed by the landing of the 1st Marine Division, at Yellow Beach 1 & 2, to the east near Silimati Point and Borgen Bay, about [...] southeast of the airfield, and a diversionary landing at Green Beach, to the west at Tauali, about [...] from Cape Gloucester. The main assault was focused on Silimati Point with only a single battalion landing in the west. The landing force came ashore aboard craft of various types including APDs, LSTs and LCIs.|$|E
2500|$|The Wendy's Company traces {{its history}} back to several predecessors, {{the oldest of}} which (Deisel-Wemmer Co., a cigar {{manufacturer}} and importer based in Ohio) was founded in 1884. By January 23, 1929, Deisel-Wemmer incorporated as Deisel-Wemmer-Gilbert Corporation (DWG) when acquired by an investment group. DWG was a small outfit and just to keep up market share purchased other small cigar companies like Odin cigars in 1930 and the Bernard Schwartz Cigar Corporation in 1939. The Company on May 15, 1946, {{changed its name to}} a simple name, DWG Cigar Corporation. Another series of acquisitions started in 1948 with the Nathan Elson Company following with A. Sensenbrenner & Sons in 1955 and in 1956 Chicago Motor Club Cigar and Reading, Pennsylvania-based Yocum Brothers. With the weakening of the cigar market due to medical advisories, many smokers switch to cigarettes, which were then believed to be safer. DWG then steamlined cigar operations and began looking for other businesses that might suite DWG's wholesale and distribution strength. The New York Stock Exchange delisted DWG in 1965 after an attempt at purchasing Allegheny Pepsi bottling company failed. DWG, thus free from NYSE reporting requirements, [...] sold their remaining cigar operations or closed them in 1966. [...] Renamed as DWG Corporation, DWG used its cash from the cigar operation sale to purchase a 12% share of the National Propane Corporation. [...] Security Management Company, headed by Victor Posner, a major investor in DWG saw potential with the company as it was bold to sell its <b>main</b> <b>operation.</b> [...] Posner saw it as a good takeover vehicle and became the controlling interest of DWG.|$|E

60|$|If the {{existing}} mental characteristics {{of women are}} thus valuable even in aid of speculation, they are still more important, when speculation has done its work, for carrying out the results of speculation into practice. For the reasons already given, women are comparatively unlikely {{to fall into the}} common error of men, that of sticking to their rules in a case whose specialities either {{take it out of the}} class to which the rules are applicable, or require a special adaptation of them. Let us now consider another of the admitted superiorities of clever women, greater quickness of apprehension. Is not this pre-eminently a quality which fits a person for practice? In action, everything continually depends upon deciding promptly. In speculation, nothing does. A mere thinker can wait, can take time to consider, can collect additional evidence; he is not obliged to complete his philosophy at once, lest the opportunity should go by. The power of drawing the best conclusion possible from insufficient data is not indeed useless in philosophy; the construction of a provisional hypothesis consistent with all known facts is often the needful basis for further inquiry. But this faculty is rather serviceable in philosophy, than the main qualification for it: and, for the auxiliary as well as for the <b>main</b> <b>operation,</b> the philosopher can allow himself any time he pleases. He is in no need of the capacity of doing rapidly what he does; what he rather needs is patience, to work on slowly until imperfect lights have become perfect, and a conjecture has ripened into a theorem. For those, on the contrary, whose business is with the fugitive and perishable--with individual facts, not kinds of facts--rapidity of thought is a qualification next only in importance to the power of thought itself. He who has not his faculties under immediate command, in the contingencies of action, might as well not have them at all. He may be fit to criticize, but he is not fit to act. Now it is in this that women, and the men who are most like women, confessedly excel. The other sort of man, however pre-eminent may be his faculties, arrives slowly at complete command of them: rapidity of judgment and promptitude of judicious action, even in the things he knows best, are the gradual and late result of strenuous effort grown into habit.|$|E
