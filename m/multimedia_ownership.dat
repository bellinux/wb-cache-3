30|$|These days, {{the growth}} of {{multimedia}} technologies and the attractiveness of the Internet are dramatically increasing. Multimedia technologies are key players in this digital information age. Data communication and information exchange between people are done in digital form and mostly over the open Internet. This means information exchange allows a third party to access all types of multimedia information. Easy accessibility of multimedia information threatens privacy, {{and there is no}} guarantee for <b>multimedia</b> <b>ownership</b> and integrity. In general, the reliability, security, integrity, and confidentiality of multimedia information are under risk while in digital form, especially on the Internet. Other than these risks, there are cases where important metadata such as encrypted patient information or digital signature for a file is accidentally deleted or the image itself is maliciously doctored. Reversible data hiding (RDH) provides a mitigation methodology for those types of scenarios by allowing users to hide a payload into their cover media. It does {{it in a way that}} the original cover image can be recovered without any distortion. For some applications such as medical and military imaging, where even the slightest distortion is not desired, RDH can be useful.|$|E

40|$|Online {{media have}} a short history. Only twenty years has passed with the moment the first {{telecommunication}} media appeared (mainly in the US). However, web journalism as an independent type of convergent journalism began to evolve relatively recently. We will examine its features {{in this article as}} an example of new music media journalism. First of all, it features such as universalism, <b>ownership</b> <b>multimedia</b> forms (e-journal, online-radio, online-TV, web portal, etc.) and hypertext, personalization, increased interactivit...|$|R
50|$|In 1997 {{the station}} moved to 91.6FM and {{subsequently}} {{became known as}} 91.6FM The Fish. This shift, under new management and <b>ownership,</b> (<b>MultiMedia</b> Services, Taupo) saw the station change genre to a more AC mix than the 'loose' format they had on 94.3FM. The former 94.3FM frequency, which was leased from Iain Stables, was sold to RadioWorks to broadcast The Rock into Taupo. In 2000 the station was purchased by The Northland Radio Company a company which operated KCC FM in the Northland region, one in Rotorua (The Mix 94.3FM) and another in Taupo (The Mix 95.9FM). They renamed The Fish to Taupo's 91.6FM. Later in 2000 the station {{was taken over by}} The Radio Network and closed down and replaced with Radio Hauraki.|$|R
5000|$|The Gannett Company bought Multimedia in 1995. As Gannett {{had owned}} The Cincinnati Enquirer since 1979 (and remains the newspaper's owner to this day), {{the company had}} to obtain a {{temporary}} waiver of an FCC cross-ownership rule which prohibited common ownership of a television station and a newspaper in the same market in order for Gannett to close on the Multimedia group. When the waiver expired in December 1996, Gannett opted to keep the Enquirer and swap WLWT and KOCO-TV in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma to Argyle Television Holdings II in exchange for WGRZ in Buffalo, New York and WZZM in Grand Rapids, Michigan, a deal which was finalized in January 1997. Argyle merged with the broadcasting unit of the Hearst Corporation to form Hearst-Argyle Television in August 1997. Hearst had owned WDTN (the former WLWD) since 1981, but the merged company opted to keep the larger WLWT and sell WDTN the next year. WLWT's licensee name under <b>Multimedia</b> and Gannett <b>ownership,</b> [...] "Multimedia Entertainment, Inc.", survives to this day as the licensee name for WGRZ. In 1996, WKRC-TV and WCPO-TV traded networks, leaving WLWT as the only Cincinnati television station to never change its affiliation. Additionally, the purchase by Hearst made WLWT sister stations with Hearst flagship stations WTAE-TV in Pittsburgh and WBAL-TV in Baltimore, leading to all three stations to have a friendly rivalry with each other during the NFL season, as all three local NFL teams (Cincinnati Bengals, Pittsburgh Steelers, Baltimore Ravens) are division rivals in the AFC North.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} impact of {{convergence}} of media and technologies on the management of news organisations and journalists' working practices. Despite being heralded as a new 'revolution' for media, convergence and its relationship with news production has been under researched. This study seeks to address this gap and focuses on the implications of convergence for the production and distribution of news in print and broadcasting organisations. Convergence is approached from a non deterministic perspective and defined as {{a complex set of}} technological, economic, managerial and occupational changes largely associated with the blurring of media industries, concentration of <b>ownership,</b> <b>multimedia</b> production processes and the digitisation of news production and distribution. This is an empirical study on newsroom practices based on interviews with senior managers and journalists in five organisations: BBC News, Sky News, Financial Times, The Guardian, and APTN. The analysis, which provides the professionals' perspective on the changes, is organised around two levels: the first is concerned with the managerial decision-making and the restructuring of production processes as a result of convergence, while the second level, drawing from the field of news production studies, investigates how the new production environment affects journalistic practices. As a consequence of the blurring boundaries between diverse media, this study observes a transformation in the management philosophy and mission of traditional news organisations. There is an impetus towards multimedia production and distribution which is achieved through newsroom integration and work reorganisation. Consequently a more demanding working environment requires more versatility from journalists, challenging traditions of media separation in production and culture, and sets the conditions for the detachment of news from its medium specific formats. At another level, new media facilitate dialogue between journalists and the audience transforming their relationship and forcing journalists to reconsider their role as both 'gateopeners' and 'gatekeepers' of information...|$|R
