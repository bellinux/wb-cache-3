Although the state of Georgia does not contribute to MARTA's operational funding, it still has voting members on the MARTA board. A similar situation existed for both Clayton and Gwinnett counties during most of MARTA's history; {{as a consequence of}} passing the authorization referendum but not the funding referendum. Gwinnett County have representation on the MARTA Board of Directors without paying into the system. This situation became controversial in 2004 when Gwinnett's representative Mychal Walker was found to have accepted US$20,000 from a lobbyist trying to secure a US$100,000,000 contract with MARTA. Despite the controversy, as well as a MARTA board ruling that Walker violated the MARTA ethics policy, the Gwinnett County Commission initially failed to remove <b>Mr.</b> <b>Walker</b> from his position on the MARTA Board. Eventually, the state legislature was called upon to change the law governing MARTA's Board to allow for the removal of a member whose appointing county did not act on a request for removal. Before the new law could be used, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Walker</b> was arrested on an unrelated child support violation, which resulted in his firing by the Gwinnett County Commission.|$|E

The Mercury wrote in its obituary on 15 June 1886: [...] "Cricketers will learn with regret of the death, after a very short illness, of Mr. William Holden Walker, {{one of the oldest}} votaries of this thoroughly English game in the colony... <b>Mr.</b> <b>Walker,</b> who previous to his departure from England, {{was a member of the}} well-known Walker Team, brought cricketing into great prominence in Launceston... His efforts in the cause of cricket are so well known that they require no comment, but his sudden demise will cause a pang among the many friends who admired his genial and gentlemanly temperament." ...|$|E

The New York Times, reviewing the second volume, tutted of Walker's passion for his subject, [...] "Mr. Walker can see only the good, and will stand for no criticism of his hero", but still called Walker's extensive research [...] "incredible.... <b>Mr.</b> <b>Walker</b> seems to know everything about Liszt, and anything connected with Liszt, during every single day of the long life of that genius." [...] The Washington Post music critic Tim Page, including the third volume in his best books of the year list, called it [...] "unquestionably a landmark" [...] and [...] "meticulously detailed, passionately argued and sometimes wrenchingly moving".|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} the term [...] "combination game" [...] is made by C. W. Alcock in 1874 when he states that [...] "Nothing succeeds better than what I may call a 'combination game'." [...] Alcock is referring to an early system of cooperation known as 'backing up' which he defines as a... "process of following closely on a fellow player, to assist him if required, and to take the ball if he be attacked or prevented from continuing his onward course." [...] Although a keen dribbler, Alcock is notable as being the first footballer ever to be ruled offside on 31 March 1866, confirming that players were probing ways of exploiting the new offside rule right from the start. As early as 1870 Alcock stated that he preferred playing football in a [...] "scientific" [...] way. [...] An example of this was reported in a contemporary account of the November 1870 football match between England and Scotland [...] "Mr Alcock made a splendid run ... and being cleverly supported by <b>Mr</b> <b>Walker,</b> a goal was obtained ... by the latter" [...] A further contemporary reference shows that Alcock himself was playing [...] "in concert" [...] with his teammates during the 1871 international match between England and Scotland: ...|$|E

She was evidently in earnest. Winterbourne overtook Daisy and her companion, and, offering the young girl his hand, told her that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Walker</b> had made an imperious claim upon his society. He expected that in answer she would say something rather free, something to commit herself still further to that [...] "recklessness" [...] from which <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Walker</b> had so charitably endeavored to dissuade her.

The exact nature of the misunderstanding he did not know, even though he was <b>Mr.</b> <b>Walker,</b> but had little doubt that it referred in some way to Grace Crawley. If the archdeacon's objection to Grace arose from the imputation against the father, that objection would now be removed, but the abolition of the posters could not as yet have been owing to any such cause as that. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Walker</b> found the major at the gate of the farmyard attached to Cosby Lodge, and perceived that at that very moment he was engaged in superintending the abolition of sundry other auctioneer's bills from sundry other posts.

In contrast to this, all the administrators who are men are much older and do not have as big a role as <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Walker</b> in making decisions.
