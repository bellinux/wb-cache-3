The PSMs were diluted dynamically to provide calibration mixtures of dry and humidified ammonia atmospheres of known composition in the nmol mol− 1 range and were employed as part of establishing a <b>metrological</b> <b>traceability</b> <b>chain</b> to improve the reliability and accuracy of ambient ammonia measurements.

Globalization requires that laboratory medicine results should be transferable between methods in the interests of patient safety. International collaboration is necessary to deliver this requirement. That collaboration should be based on traceability in laboratory medicine and the adoption of higher order international commutable reference materials and measurement procedures. Application of the <b>metrological</b> <b>traceability</b> <b>chain</b> facilitates a universal approach. The measurement of serum cholesterol and blood HbA 1 c serve as examples of the process of method standardization where an impact on clinical outcomes is demonstrable. The measurement of plasma parathyroid hormone and blood HbA 2 serve as examples where the current between-method variability is compromising patient management and method standardization and/or harmonization is required. Challenges to the widespread adoption of traceability in laboratory medicine include the availability of reference materials and methods, geographical differences, the use of variable units, complex analytes and limited global coordination. The global collaboration requires the involvement of several different stakeholder groups ranging from international experts to laboratory medicine specialists in routine clinical laboratories.

40|$|A {{metrological}} {{background for}} investigating out-of-specification (OOS) test results of chemical composition is discussed. When an OOS test result is identified, {{it is important}} to determine its root causes and to avoid reoccurrence of such results. An investigation of the causes based on metrological concepts is proposed. It includes assessment of validation data of the measurement process and its <b>metrological</b> <b>traceability</b> <b>chains,</b> evaluation of measurement uncertainty, and related producer’s and consumer’s risks. This approach allows distinguishing between OOS test results that indicate an actual change in chemical composition of an analyzed object, and OOS test results that are metrologically related with a certain confidence probability, i. e., caused by measurement problems, while the analyzed object still meets the specification requirements at the time of testing. Practical examples illustrating applications of the described approach in environmental and food analysis, as well in drug analysis and stability study of drug products, are described. Acceptance limits, warning and actionlines for the test results, and corresponding producer’s and consumer’s risks are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The PhD {{activity}} {{described in}} the present work concerned the determination of organic micropollutants in food matrices at trace level, with the aim of correctly evaluating the measurement uncertainty and establishing <b>metrological</b> <b>traceability</b> for the results of these measurements. The <b>metrological</b> <b>traceability</b> of organic micropollutants measurements is a relevant issue due to the potential adverse effects that these substances can act on human health and on natural ecosystems. Many organic micropollutants have been classified as Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), in the framework of the Stockholm Convention (2001) [1]. The research activity was addressed to the study of some food matrices and the attention was focused on two different matrices, green tea powder and milk, and on two organic molecules: - endosulfan, an organochlorine pesticide banned in 2011 due to its toxicity, analysed in green tea; - melamine, a molecule commonly used in the plastic industry which became famous for its fraudulent use as adulterant of the protein content of milk in 2008. Ad hoc methods were developed for the extraction of these molecules from food samples and for their quantification by means of two different analytical techniques: - gaschromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), for the analysis of endosulfan; - Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) spectroscopy for the analysis of melamine. For the development of these methods a metrological approach was adopted and correct <b>metrological</b> <b>traceability</b> <b>chains</b> to the SI units were established, considering all the steps which constitute an analytical method. The activity concerning the Organochlorine Pesticides (OCPs) started for the participation in 2012 in an international comparison carried out in the framework of the Comité Consultatif pour la Quantité de Matière (CCQM), namely the "Pilot Study CCQM-P 136 Mid-Polarity Analytes in Food Matrix: Mid-Polarity Pesticides in Tea". <b>Metrological</b> <b>traceability</b> was established using suitable Certified Reference Materials (CRMs), both for the calibration of the analytical instrumentation and for the evaluation of the recovery efficiency of the analytes from the matrix. For the uncertainty evaluation, two approaches were followed: the classical GUM approach based on the law of propagation of uncertainty [2] and the Monte Carlo method [3]. The activity for the determination of melamine in milk consisted in the set up of an extraction procedure followed by the analysis by means of Raman spectroscopy, performed after mixing the samples with gold nanoparticles. Their synthesis is carried out in order to obtain particles having a diameter of 40 nm and a negatively charged surface, which allows their interaction with the melamine molecules (positively charged at acidic pH). These agglomerates are responsible for the amplification of the Raman signal by means of the SERS effect, which generates a considerable intensity enhancement of the Raman signal when the sample is put in contact with a metallic irregular surface or constituted of metallic nanoparticles. This procedure was validated by studying different parameters (linearity, repeatability, limit of detection, limit of quantification and recovery). The developed method allows the quantification of melamine in milk samples in accordance with the European law limits, fixed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, due to its potential toxicity, to 1 mg/l for powder infant formula and 2. 5 mg/l for other foods and animal feed [4]. For the determination of the calibration curve of the Raman spectrophotometer and of the uncertainties of the related coefficients, an algorithm based on Total Weighted Least Squares [5] was used, which takes into account the uncertainty contributions deriving from the instrumental repeatability and the calibration solutions used to calibrate the measuring instrument.

40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction: <b>Metrological</b> <b>traceability</b> is {{a little-known}} and little-discussed {{metrology}} theme in clinical laboratories, {{although it is}} the basis for comparable results. It is associated with certified reference material (CRM) and reference method (RMet). When it is used in the supply chain by diagnostic kit manufacturers, it ensures accuracy of the results yielded by laboratories. Objective: This study shows the availability of information on <b>metrological</b> <b>traceability</b> provided by diagnostic kit manufacturers. Method: It was done with the information obtained in kits of glucose, urea, creatinine, uric acid and cholesterol participants in a proficiency testing program throughout 2012 and 2013. Results and conclusion: In the research, 18 producers of reference materials (RMs) and 204 measurands available for laboratory medicine were found. In the study of <b>metrological</b> <b>traceability,</b> the preferential use of CRM was demonstrated by kit manufacturers (glucose 60 %, urea 69 %, creatinine 60 %, uric acid 50 %, and cholesterol 43 %). An important factor {{is that there are a}} significant number of kits that do not report traceability (glucose 16 %, urea 19 %, creatinine 16 %, uric acid 13 %, and cholesterol 5 %), although it is a requirement for product registration in Brazil.

40|$|<b>Metrological</b> <b>traceability</b> of {{measurement}} results {{is a key}} requirement for the comparability of such data {{in time and space}} and with legal or product specifications. Similarly, traceability of the certified values of a certified reference material is a prerequisite for its usefulness. Consequently, the statement on <b>metrological</b> <b>traceability</b> of the certified value of the specified property is a requirement of the ISO Guide series on Reference Materials. The establishment of the traceability of a value assigned to a property of a reference material to a stated reference is pivotal to the use of this material. <b>Metrological</b> <b>traceability</b> is related to a combination of four attributes which are assigned to a clearly identified matrix: description of the property, description of the quantity/kind-of-quantity, a number with its corresponding uncertainty and the measurement unit. The first two items define the identity of the measurand, whereas the latter two describe value that is assigned to this measurand. Therefore, the concept of traceability rests on two anchor points, namely identity and quantity value. The identity of a measurand van be defined by its structure alone or by an operational/procedural definition, the quantity value of the measurand can refer to the SI, or to an artefact, if standards of arbitrary values have been used for the calibration of equipment (e. g. WHO standards; international units etc.). The presented approach splits traceability statements of certified reference materials into a description of the identity of the measurand an the quantity value and provided a solution to overcome the conflict whether a measurement result should be declared as traceable to the SI or traceable to a method.

40|$|Metrology in {{chemistry}} {{has its own}} features which distinguish it from classical metrology. In particular, the application of metrological concepts to the determination of organic pollutants in different matrices is a challenge. In fact, it deals with {{an enormous amount of}} different compounds, which are present at various concentrations, often at trace level, and can interact with the matrix constituents. For such kinds of measurements, the achievement of <b>metrological</b> <b>traceability</b> is a non trivial aspect and one of the tasks to be carried out is the evaluation of measurement uncertainty taking into consideration all relevant contributions. At I. N. Ri. M. a research activity dealing with organic analysis has started. The first analytes taken into account are polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The choice is due to their relevance as environmental pollutants, a reason that led to their inclusion among the twelve classes of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), selected by United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) under the Stockholm Convention on POPs in 1997. Traceable PCBs standards of different congeners in iso-octane are prepared by accurate weighing by diluting certified reference materials. A correct uncertainty budget is developed taking into account all the possible uncertainty sources, deriving both from the reference materials and from the weighing process. The PCBs are determined by a gas-chromatograph coupled with a single quadrupole mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The interpretation of mass spectra obtained in scan mode allows the identification of the different congeners. GC-MS is calibrated using the traceable standard solutions prepared by weighing. The PCBs congeners amount in unknown samples is determined by comparing the ion current generated by each congener with respect to the calibration curve, assuring <b>metrological</b> <b>traceability</b> of results.
