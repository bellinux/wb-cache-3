(U–Th) –Pb monazite ages are reported from the high-grade nappes of the Andrela ˆ ndia Nappe Complex to better constrain the high-temperature retrograde evolution. For residual HP granulites from the uppermost Tre ˆ s Pontas–Varginha Nappe, (U–Th) –Pb ages ofc. 662 and 655 Ma from low yttrium monazite inclusions in the rims of, or associated with garnet are interpreted to date the late-stage close-to-peak prograde evolution, whereas an age of c. 648 Ma from a similar low yttrium monazite inclusion is interpreted to record post-peak recrystallization with melt via factures in garnet. For the same nappe, ages of 640 – 631 Ma retrieved from higher yttrium areas or cores in monazite grains that occur both as inclusions in garnet and in the matrix are interpreted to record growth of monazite either by local breakdown of garnet (±older monazite) and mass exchange with a matrix <b>melt</b> <b>reservoir</b> along cracks or growth from residual melt in the matrix as it crystallized during high-pressure, closeto-isobaric cooling close to the solidus, the temperature of which, at a given pressure, varies with bul...|$|E
40|$|The Late Cretaceous Mount Givens pluton, {{located in}} the central Sierra Nevada batholith, is {{noteworthy}} for its large size (~ 1400 km 2) and relative compositional and textural homogeneity. The pluton {{is characterized by a}} 30 km wide, ellipse-shaped northern lobe (ca. 98 - 91 Ma) that connects with a long mass (ca. 95 - 91 Ma) about 15 km wide and extends 50 km SE. Zircon trace elements and d 18 O and eHf from a sample suite representative of the observable petrologic diversity of the pluton document significant heterogeneities. All zircons have high Ti-in-zircon model temperatures (850 - 1000 °C), pronounced negative Eu anomalies, and concave down MREE and HREE patterns, indicating initial melts were undersaturated in zircon and that zircon growth occurred during ascent or emplacement of Mount Givens magmas. Zircon trace elements record appreciable variation, and suggest that crystal transfer was ongoing throughout pluton growth. Significant variations in O and Hf isotopes require mixing of multiple, isotopically distinct sources. Longitudinal variation in both systems suggests increasing mantle contributions in the eastern portion of the pluton. A clear decrease in isotopic variability at all scales in post- 95 Ma samples indicates that later magmas were more thoroughly mixed prior to emplacement. This increase in zircon isotopic homogeneity paired with the narrow timespan of intrusion hints that the inner portion of the northern lobe may have existed as a large <b>melt</b> <b>reservoir...</b>|$|E
40|$|We present {{trace element}} data for HFSE-rich {{minerals}} (titanite, eudialyte, Ti-bearing andradite, zircon) from plutonic rocks of the Eocene Tamazeght complex, High Atlas Mountains, Morocco. In most lithologies {{significant amounts of}} titanite are present and as such, titanite fractionation {{played a major role}} in the evolution of the HFSE budget of the whole complex. By combining our data with published titanite-melt partition coefficients we explore the effects of titanite fractionation on the evolution of geochemical parameters (Zr/Hf, Nb/Ta, La/Lu and Th/U ratios) during differentiation of silicate melts in detail. Based upon this, we further discuss the genetic relationships between the various rock types present in the Tamazeght complex and show that the above-mentioned element ratios can potentially be useful for distinguishing geochemically distinct <b>melt</b> <b>reservoirs</b> within a given plutonic rock suite. Zircon, eudialyte and Ti-bearing andradite are generally rare or are restricted to localized rock units. Despite their scarcity, each of them can have a significant effect upon the HFSE budget in their evolving magmas. Here, we derive first estimations of eudialyte-melt partition coefficients for REE. Application of these data to eudialyte-bearing rocks of the Ilímaussaq complex (South Greenland), and comparing the results to published estimations for the parental melts of these rocks yields consistent results and demonstrates the reliability of our estimations. 20 page(s...|$|R

Our study reveals that the chondrules are of diverse mineralogy with variable olivine-pyroxene ratios (Type II), igneous melt textures developed under variable cooling rates and formed through melt fractionations from two different <b>melt</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> Based on the experimental analogues, mineralogical associations and phase compositions, {{it is suggested that}} the Dergaon chondrules reflect two contrasting environments: a hot, dust-enriched and highly oxidized nebular environment through melting, without significant evaporation, and an arrested reducing environment concomitant with major evaporation loss of alkali and highly volatile trace elements. Coexistence of chlorapatite and merrillite suggests formation of the Dergaon matrix in an acidic accretionary environment. Textural integration and chemical homogenization occurred at ∼ 1 atmospheric pressure and a mean temperature of 765  °C mark the radiogenic thermal event. Equilibrated shock features (olivine mosaicism, diaplectic plagioclase, polycrystalline troilite) due to an impact-induced thermal event reflect a shock pressure > 45  GPa and temperature of 600  °C.

40|$|We report {{results from}} a seismic {{refraction}} experiment across three sections of the Western Galápagos Spreading Center (WGSC) with contrasting axial morphology. Tomography models show {{the presence of an}} axial low velocity zone at the three study areas. After correcting for thermal effects, we estimate the melt content within these regions. At each of the three sites, the largest <b>melt</b> <b>reservoir</b> is located at or just below the Moho, which is 5. 25 km deep at site GALA- 1 within an axial-valley morphological domain, 6 km deep at GALA- 2 in a morphological transitional domain, and 7. 5 km deep at GALA- 3 within the axial-high domain. The tomography model does not require melt above the Moho at GALA- 1, nor at GALA- 2, where we find little evidence for crustal melt between the Moho and a melt lens previously imaged at 2. 8 km depth. In contrast, at GALA- 3 the low velocity anomaly requires the presence of a few percent melt throughout the crust, with two distinct crustal reservoirs: one {{at the level of the}} seismically imaged melt lens reflector (1. 6 km deep), and a deeper one at 3 – 4 km depth. The differences in axial melt content and distribution between the three sites are consequences of variations in magma supply, with lower magma supply resulting in less frequent upward migration of melt from the main Moho reservoir to crustal levels. At higher melt supply, transfer of melt to the crust above the main Moho reservoir becomes more frequent, resulting in the formation of distinct crustal melt reservoirs...|$|E
40|$|Rifting along southeastern Eurasia in the Late Cenozoic {{led to the}} {{formation}} of a magma-poor rifted margin facing the South China Sea to the southeast and the Philippine Sea to the east. Further rifting along the outer part of the margin during the middle to late Miocene was accompanied by an extensive episode of intraplate flood volcanism that formed the Penghu Archipelago. Previous geophysical studies in the area of the strait have focused primarily on the shallow structures of the rift basins and the depth to the Moho. In this study we present the regional-scale 3 -D S wave structure of the Taiwan Strait that is derived from a joint Chinese and Taiwanese 3 -D ambient noise tomography study. The S wave model shows a thinning of the crust beneath the rift basins where, locally, thin high-velocity layers suggest the presence of intrusive bodies. The rift basin and the foreland basin along the west coast of Taiwan are imaged as low-velocity zones with thicknesses between 5 and 10 km and extending eastward beneath the Taiwan mountain belt. In the upper 10 km of the crust, the basaltic rocks of the Penghu Archipelago are imaged as a high-velocity zone that, with depth, becomes a relatively low-velocity zone. We interpret this low-velocity zone in the lower crust and upper mantle beneath the Penghu Archipelago to image a thermal anomaly related to the still cooling magma feeding system and the <b>melt</b> <b>reservoir</b> area that fed the flood basalts at the surface. © 2016.

Results for Li, Na, V, Cr, Fe and Zn are from diffusion of these elements out of the olivine, starting from their indigenous concentrations; those for all other elements are from diffusion into the olivine, from the silicate <b>melt</b> <b>reservoir.</b> Our 25 -day experiment produced diffusion profiles 50 to > 700 μm in length, which are sufficiently long that precise analyses could be achieved by scanning laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, even at concentration levels well below 1 μg g^− 1. For the divalent cations Ca, Mn, Fe and Ni, profiles were also obtained by electron microprobe analysis. The results of the two methods agree well with each other, and are consistent with divalent cation diffusion coefficients previously determined using different experimental methodologies. Olivine/melt partition coefficients retrieved from the data are also consistent with other published partitioning data, indicating that element incorporation and transport in olivine in our experiment occurred via mechanisms appropriate to natural conditions. Most of the examined trace elements diffuse through olivine at similar rates to the major octahedral cations Fe and Mg, showing that cation charge and radius have little direct influence on diffusion rates. Aluminium and P remain low and constant in the olivine, implying negligible transport at our analytical scale, hence Al and P diffusion rates that are at least two orders of magnitude slower than the other cations studied here. All determined element diffusivities are anisotropic, with diffusion fastest along the [001] axis, except Y and the REEs, which diffuse isotropically. The results suggest that element diffusivity in olivine is largely controlled by cation site preference, charge balance mechanisms and point-defect concentrations. Elements that are present on multiple cation sites in olivine (e. g. Be and Ti) and trivalent elements that are charge-balanced by octahedral site vacancies tend to diffuse at relatively fast rates...|$|E
40|$|Our {{ability to}} monitor volcanoes (using seismic signals, ground deformation, gas fluxes, or other ground and {{satellite}} based observations) {{as well as}} our understanding of <b>melt</b> <b>reservoirs</b> that feed eruptions have evolved tremendously in recent years. The complex plumbing systems that are thought to feed eruptions are, however, difficult to relate to the monitoring signals. Here we show that the record preserved in compositional zoning of erupted minerals may be used to reconstruct sections of the plumbing system. Kinetic modeling of such zoning can yield information on the residence time of magma in different segments of the plumbing systems. This allows a more nuanced evaluation of the link between observed monitoring signals or eruption styles and the magmatic processes and movement of batches of melts at depth. The approach is illustrated through a study of the compositional zoning recorded in olivine crystals from the 1991 – 1993 SE-flank eruption products of Mt. Etna (Sicily). The zoning patterns in crystals reveal that the plumbing system of the volcano consisted of at least three different magmatic environments between which magma was transported and mixed in the year or two preceding the start of eruption. Quantification of this history indicates that two main pathways of melt migration and three timescales dominated the dynamics of the system. Combination of this information with the timing of observation of various monitoring signals allows a reconstruction of the dynamic evolution of this section of the plumbing system during {{the early stages of the}} 1991 – 1993 eruption. It is seen, for example, how the migration of melt through the same sections of the plumbing system can cause pre-eruptive triggering, enhance Strombolian activity, and through the ensuing eruption cleanse and flush the plumbing system. Different kinds of mixing occur simultaneously at different sections of the plumbing system on different timescales (a few days up to two years) ...|$|R

40|$|Li {{contents}} [Li] and {{isotopic composition}} (delta Li- 7) of mafic minerals (mainly amphibole and clinopyroxene) from the alkaline to peralkaline Ilimaussaq plutonic complex, South Greenland, track {{the behavior of}} Li and its isotopes during magmatic differentiation and final cooling of an alkaline igneous system. [Li] in amphibole increase from 3000 ppm in Na-amphiboles of the highly evolved units. In contrast, [Li] in clinopyroxene are comparatively low (< 85 ppm) and do not vary systematically with differentiation. The distribution of Li between amphibole and pyroxene {{is controlled by the}} major element composition of the minerals (Ca-rich and Na-rich, respectively) and changes in oxygen fugacity (due to Li incorporation via coupled substitution with ferric iron) during magmatic differentiation. delta(7) Li values of all minerals span a wide range from + 17 to - 8 parts per thousand, with the different intrusive units of the complex having distinct Li isotopic systematics. Amphiboles, which dominate the Li budget of whole-rocks from the inner part of the complex, have constant delta Li- 7 of + 1. 8 +/- 2. 2 parts per thousand (2 sigma, n = 15). This value reflects a homogeneous <b>melt</b> <b>reservoir</b> and is consistent with their mantle derivation, in agreement with published O and Nd isotopic data. Clinopyroxenes of these samples are consistently lighter, with Delta Li- 7 (amph-cpx). as large as 8 parts per thousand and are thus not in Li isotope equilibrium. These low values probably reflect late-stage diffusion of Li into clinopyroxene during final cooling of the rocks, thus enriching the clinopyroxene in 6 Li. At the margin of the complex delta(7) Li in the syenites increases systematically, from + 2 to high values of + 14 parts per thousand. This, coupled with the observed Li isotope systematics of the granitic country rocks, reflects post-magmatic open-system processes occurring during final cooling of the intrusion. Although the shape and magnitude of the Li isotope and elemental profiles through syenite and country rock are suggestive of diffusion-driven isotope fractionation, they cannot be modeled by one-dimensional diffusive transport and point to circulation of a fluid having a high 67 Li value (possibly seawater) along the chilled contact. In all, this study demonstrates that Li isotopes can be used to identify complex fluid- and diffusion-governed processes taking place during the final cooling of such rocks. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this dissertation depicts past and present signatures of melt distribution at fast and intermediate spreading centers. The primary goal of the studies included in this thesis is to provide better understanding of melt distribution and variation in melt physical properties within and {{at the base of}} oceanic crust formed at these spreading centers. Furthermore, this work examines effects that melt presence might have on formation and structural characteristics of oceanic crust. To explore the above we use geophysical data collected during two expeditions conducted along the Juan de Fuca Ridge (intermediate) and the East Pacific Rise (fast). The major part of the thesis is based on the work conducted on high resolution reflection seismic data that investigate present day intracrustal melt distribution along the East Pacific Rise (EPR) axis extending between 8 º 20 ’ and 10 º 10 ’N. Here, the character of the <b>melt</b> <b>reservoir</b> is examined from different aspects and by using different seismic data analysis methods. By systematic analysis of the seismic reflection data, we show that the axial melt lens (AML) is segmented at different segment scales. Locations of the mapped disruptions in the AML correspond to previously identified tectonic discontinuities well expressed in the seafloor bathymetry. The above result corroborates genetic relationship between tectonic and magmatic segmentation. To examine melt distribution along the EPR, {{here for the first time}} we use amplitude variation with angle of incidence (AVA) crossplotting technique that was developed by oil and gas industry experts to look for presence of hydrocarbons. Further data examination for the first time for the mid-ocean ridges show presence of deeper lenses (lenses that are present below the AML). Presence of gaps in these sub-events and their collocation with what is believed to be the location of origin of the last documented eruption occurred in 2005 - 06, may shed light on the mechanisms behind the mid-ocean ridges volcanic processes. To explore variation in crustal structure and melt distribution at present day along the Juan de Fuca Ridge and relicts of past melt presence near ridge propagators wakes, a combination of gravity and multi-channel seismic data was used. Gravity modeling, constrained by seismic data, showed that robust topography (shallow axial depth and wide axial high) and thicker crust observed for the southern portion of this ridge system originate from enhanced melt supply at the base of the crust. In addition, prominent crustal thickening on the younger crust side of the inner propagators wakes (now on the ridge flanks) is brought into relationship with collocated frozen magma lenses imaged at the base of the crust. Spatial relationship of the two argues for their causal relationship at the time of the crustal formation on the axis. Our study suggests that these frozen lenses represent the record of once molten reservoir that most probably actively participated in the formation of the thicker crust...|$|E

A supraglacial lake-depth {{retrieval}} {{function is}} developed, {{based on the}} correspondence between moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance and water depth measured during raft surveys. Individual lake depth, area and volume statistics, including short-term temporal changes for Greenland’s southwestern ablation region, were compiled for 2000 – 05. The maximum area of an individual lake {{was found to be}} 8. 9 km 2, the maximum volume 53. 0 106 m 3 and the maximum depth 12. 2 m, sampling over 0. 0625 km 2 pixel areas.

The importance of <b>melt</b> lake <b>reservoirs</b> to Greenland ice-sheet flow may be a feedback between abrupt lake drainage events and ice dynamics. Lake-outburst volumes up to 31. 5106 m 3 d– 1 are capable of providing sufficient water via moulins to hydraulically pressurize the subglacial environment. Since the overburden pressure {{at the base of a}} flooded moulin is greater than that provided by ice, lake-outburst events seem capable of exerting sufficient upward force to lift the ice sheet locally, if water flow in the subglacial environment is constrained laterally.

40|$|Stretchability {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} functional properties of Mozzarella cheese, but no objective and widely accepted technique exists for evaluation; most of the cheese stretchability tests are influenced by the ambient conditions. This paper demonstrates a technique, which is novel and relatively simple, to evaluate the stretchability of Mozzarella cheese objectively. In an oil bath, melted cheese is stretched by a hook probe, controlled by an Instron tensile tester (Instron Corp., Norwood, MA); cheese strands are lifted from the <b>melted</b> cheese <b>reservoir</b> to a stretch length of 300 mm, when the load and extension data are recorded by the Instron tensile tester. This test overcomes other tests' drawbacks, such as subjective stretching speeds and variations in ambient temperature and humidity. Through the test comparison on standard Mozzarella, the modified stretching test in an oil bath has greater repeatability than the original test without oil bath. From the load and extension curve, the yield load is measured to evaluate the stretchability. In the meantime, the inversion point extension of necking is also measured based on polymer study, producing more repeatable results than the yield load. The modified 3 -prong hook test was applied to Mozzarella cheese samples with different processing conditions, including the screw conditions (screw time, speed, and temperature), draining pH, calcium content, and fat content, and significant differences were found between these samples and the control sample...|$|R
40|$|A {{correlation}} between the USU stretch test and the pizza fork test would allow the stretch properties of Mozzarella cheese to be measured objectively. The Utah State University (USU) Stretch Test uses a modified texture-profile analyzer to pull strands of cheese from a <b>melted</b> <b>reservoir,</b> measuring the load exerted on the probe during stretching. Parameters measured by the USU stretch test include Melt Strength (FM), which is the maximum load exerted on the probe, Stretch Load (SL), which is the load exerted on the probe at any specified point following FM, and Stretch Extension (SE), which {{was defined as the}} extension of the probe at a selected load. To begin with, it was determined that the greatest repeatability and cheese performance was obtained by tempering 50 g of shredded cheese for 45 min at 65 °C and using a three-pronged hook with a diameter of 25 mm as the probe. These conditions were then applied in a correlation study in which a low correlation was seen between the USU stretch test and the pizza fork test, with the greatest correlation being seen with FM (R 2 = 0. 22). A more extensive look at the effect of the tempering temperature used in the USU stretch test on the degree of {{correlation between}} the two tests was conducted by tempering cheeses at 65, 70, 75, 80, and 85 °C. In this experiment, the highest {{correlation between the}} two tests was seen at both 80 and 85 °C. Values of R 2 at 80 °C for SL 10 - 15 and SEF (Stretch Extension at FM) were 0. 75 and 0. 70, respectively. At 85 °C, the highest degree of correlation was seen at SL 10 - 15 (R 2 = 0. 72) and SE 0. 1 (R 2 = 0. 69). A multiple linear correlation study was also conducted. A high degree of correlation between the USU stretch test and the pizza fork test was seen at 80 °C when two parameters were used (SEF and SL 22, R 2 = 0. 85, Adj. R 2 = 0. 80) and when four parameters were used (FM, slope from 10 to 20 em, SE 0. 1, and SL 22, R 2 = 0. 97, Adj. R 2 = 0. 93). A set of cheese was then analyzed by the USU stretch test and the pizza fork test at three different intervals of aging (21, 40, and 60 days after manufacture). This data was combined with previously collected data to show that the USU stretch test can be used to characterize the functional properties of a cheese using the parameters of FM, SEF, as well as SE 0. 1. It was concluded that the USU stretch test can provide a better characterization of a pizza cheese than can the pizza fork test. Whereas the pizza fork test is only able to record the distance that the cheese can stretch, the USU stretch test is capable of measuring a variety of parameters, which provides not only an indication of how far the cheese will stretch, but also other important functional properties related to the cheese, such as viscosity, elasticity, and the thickness of the strands being stretched...|$|R

The model proved to be suitable to simulate the typical discharge seasonality of a heavily glaciated basin. The performance of the model was also tested by simulating discharge in the whole Swiss Rhone basin, in which glaciers contribution is not negligible, in fact, in summer, about the 40 % of the discharge is due to glacier melt.

40|$|Tide gauge {{records of}} recent sea-level change along the U. S. east coast have {{received}} significant attention {{within the literature}} of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). Geographic trends in these tide gauge rates are not reduced by a GIA correction based on a commonly adopted radial viscosity profile (characterized, in particular, by a lower mantle viscosity ~ 1 - 2 × 1021  Pa s), and {{this has led to}} speculation that the residual trends reflect contributions from neotectonics or oceanographic processes. While the trends can be significantly reduced by adopting an Earth model with a stiffer lower mantle, such a model appears to be incompatible with independent constraints from post-glacial decay times in Hudson Bay. We use a finite-element model of the GIA process to investigate whether 3 -D viscosity variations superimposed onto the "common" radial viscosity profile may provide a route to reconciling the east coast sea-level trends. We find that the specific 3 -D structure we impose has little impact on the geographic trends in the GIA-corrected rates. However, we do find that the imposed lateral variations in lower mantle viscosity introduce a nearly uniform upward shift of 0. 5  mm/yr in GIA-induced sea-level rates along the U. S. east coast. Thus, inferences of regional (U.

5000|$|Many {{different}} {{theories have}} been advanced for how floods of water {{came to be}} released {{with the formation of}} chaotic terrain. Evidence for the involvement of water has been found—minerals associated with water, such as grey, crystalline hematite and phyllosilicates, are present in chaos regions. [...] Many explanations for the creation of chaos involve the sudden <b>melting</b> of giant <b>reservoirs</b> of ground ice. Some researchers have suggested that a frozen layer, called a cryosphere, developed over a long time period and then something triggered it to rupture and melt suddenly. The rupturing event may have been impacts,magma movements, seismic activity, [...] volcanic tectonic strains, [...] increased pore pressure, or the dissociation of clathrates. A clathrate composed of carbon dioxide and methane could have explosively dissociated, thereby liquefying water-saturated sediments. A variation of this idea of a cryosphere is that an aquifer was created along with the cryosphere. As more and more ice was added resulting in a thicker cryosphere, the water in the aquifer became pressurized. [...] When something like an impact or movement of magma broke or melted the cryosphere, floods of water under great pressure were released. However, further calculations showed that the great channels could not have been produced with just a single discharge.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Throughout {{many of the}} world’s {{mountain}} ranges snowpack accumulates during the winter and into the spring, providing a natural reservoir for water. As this <b>reservoir</b> <b>melts,</b> it fills streams and recharges groundwater for over 1 billion people globally. Despite its importance to water resources, {{our understanding of the}} storage capacity of mountain snowpack is incomplete. This partial knowledge limits our abilities to assess the impact that projected climate conditions will have on mountain snowpack and water resources. While understanding the effect of projected climate on mountain snowpack is a global question, it can be best understood at the basin scale. It is at this level that decision makers and water resource managers base their decisions and require a clarified understanding of basin's mountain snowpack. The McKenzie River Basin located in the central-western Cascades of Oregon exhibits characteristics typical of many mountain river systems globally and in the Pacific Northwestern United States. Here snowmelt provides critical water supply for hydropower, agriculture, ecosystems, recreation, and municipalities. While there is a surplus of water in winter, the summer months see flows reach a minimum and the same groups have to compete for a limited supply. Throughout the Pacific Northwestern United States, current analyses and those of projected future climate change impacts show rising temperatures, diminished snowpacks, and declining summertime streamflow. The impacts of climate change on water resources presents new challenges and requires fresh approaches to understanding problems that are only beginning to be recognized. Climate change also presents challenges to decision makers who need new kinds of climate and water information, and will need the scientific research community to help provide improved means of knowledge transfer.

40|$|The {{presence}} and spread of clinically important antibiotic-resistant bacteria in reservoirs from natural environments {{are not well}} studied compared to the clinical environments. The overall aim of this project was to study the presence of clinically important antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a reservoir from natural environments. Wild birds were chosen not only as indicators {{of the level of}} antibiotic resistance in surrounding natural bacterial populations, but also since birds can act as vectors of several potential pathogens including enteropathogens and because they by migration have an ability to spread these pathogens across geographical regions. The studies in this thesis showed that wild birds carry antibiotic-resistant enterobacteriaceae. The levels and spectrum of antibiotic resistance varies between different bird populations and geographical regions. In bird populations without interaction with human activities throughout the year, antibiotic resistance is lacking. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria could however probably be dispersed to remote regions by bird migration. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and especially CTX-M types are found in comparable high levels in gull populations considering the recent emergence of these resistance genes in clinical settings. The CTX-M types found in wild birds are the same types that are found in clinical settings and in food producing animals from the same regions. ESBL-producing E. coli isolated from Yellow-legged Gulls are genetically heterogenous, reflecting that these resistance genes are present across the full E. coli genetic diversity. In wild birds CTX-M are found both in E. coli strains with previously known “human signature” as well as “novel” strains. This indicates that these genes are indeed very mobile and rapidly dispersing both through horizontal gene transfer and through successful clones. The findings in this thesis indicate that bird colonies could act as <b>melting</b> pots and <b>reservoirs</b> for new resistance types and that wild birds could act as important indicators of the level of antibiotic resistance dispersal in natural environments...|$|R
40|$|International audienceChemical {{weathering}} of basalts in the Putorana Plateau, Central Siberia, {{has been}} studied by combining chemical and mineralogical analysis of solids (rocks, soils, river sediments, and suspended matter) and fluid solution chemistry. Altogether, 70 large and small rivers, 30 soil pore waters and groundwaters and over 30 solids were sampled during July to August 2001. Analysis of multiannual data on discharge and chemical composition of several rivers of the region available from the Russian Hydrological Survey allowed rigorous estimation of mean annual major element concentrations, and dissolved and suspended fluxes associated with basalt weathering. For the rivers Tembenchi and Taimura that drain monolithologic basic volcanic rocks, the mean multiannual flux of total dissolved cations (TDS_c = Ca + Mg + Na + K) corrected for atmospheric input is 5. 7 ± 0. 5 t/km 2 /yr. For the largest river Nizhniya Tunguska?draining essentially basic rocks?the TDS_c is 6. 1 ± 1. 5 t/km 2 /yr. The overall CO 2 consumption flux associated with basalt weathering in the studied region (? 700, 000 km 2) achieves 0. 08 × 1012 mol/yr, which represents only 2. 6 % of the total CO 2 consumption associated with basalt weathering at the Earth?s surface. The fluxes of suspended matter were estimated as 3. 1 ± 0. 5, 9. 0 ± 0. 8, and 6. 5 ± 2. 0 t/km 2 /yr for rivers Taimura, Eratchimo, and Nizhniya Tunguska, respectively. Based on chemical analyses of river solutes and suspended matter, the relative dissolved versus particulate annual transport of major components is Cinorg ? Corg > Na + K > Ca > Mg > Si > Fe ? Mn ? Ti ? Al which reflects the usual order of element mobility during weathering. According to chemical and mineralogical soil and sediment analyses, alteration of basalt consists of (1) replacement of the original basaltic glass by Si-Al-Fe rich amorphous material, (2) mechanical desegregation and grinding of parent rocks, leading to accumulation of ?primary? hydrothermal trioctahedral smectite, and (3) transformation of these trioctahedral (oxy) smectites and mixed-layer chlorite-smectite, into secondary dioctahedral smectite accompanied by removal of Ca, Mg, and Fe, and enrichment in Al. No vertical chemical differentiation of fluid and solid phases within the soil profile was identified. All sampled soil pore waters and groundwaters {{were found to be}} close to equilibrium with respect to chalcedony, gibbsite, halloysite, and allophanes, but strongly supersaturated with respect to goethite, nontronite, and montmorillonite. Over the annual cycle, the contribution of atmospheric precipitation, permafrost <b>melting,</b> underground <b>reservoirs,</b> litter degradation, and rock and soil mineral weathering for the overall TDS_c transport in the largest river of the region (Nizhniya Tunguska) is 9. 3 ± 3, 10 ± 5, 10. 5 ± 5, 25 ± 20, and 45 ± 30 %, respectively. In the summertime, direct contribution of rocks and soil mineral weathering via solid/fluid interaction does not exceed 20 %.

Composition and crystallization conditions of primary magmas in equilibrium with olivine Fo 90 - 92 were inferred from high-temperature microthermometric quench experiments, low-temperature microthermometry of fluid inclusions and simulation of the reverse path of olivine fractional crystallization based on major element composition of melt inclusions. Primary magmas parental for the Miocene shield basalts range from transitional to alkaline picrites (14. 7 – 19. 3 wt% MgO, 43. 2 – 45. 7 wt% SiO 2). Crystallization of these primary magmas {{is believed to have}} occurred over the temperature range 1490 – 1150 °[*]C at pressures ≈ 5  kbar producing olivine of Fo 80. 6 - 90. 2, high-Ti chrome spinel [Mg/ (Mg+Fe 2 +) = 0. 32 – 0. 56, Cr/(Cr+Al) = 0. 50 – 0. 78, 2. 52 – 8. 58 wt% TiO 2], and clinopyroxene [Mg/(Mg+Fe) = 0. 79 – 0. 88, Wo 44. 1 - 45. 3, En 43. 9 - 48. 0, Fs 6. 8 - 11. 0] which appeared on the liquidus together with olivine≈Fo 86. Redox conditions evolved from intermediate between the QFM and WM buffers to late-stage conditions of NNO+ 1 to NNO+ 2. The primary magmas crystallized in the presence of an essentially pure CO 2 fluid. The primary magmas originated at pressures > 30 kbar and temperatures of 1500 – 1600 °[*]C, assuming equilibrium with mantle peridotite. This implies melting of the mantle source at a depth of ≈ 100  km within the garnet stability field followed by migration of <b>melts</b> into magma <b>reservoirs</b> located at the boundary between the upper mantle and lower crust.

40|$|For mountainous regions, such as Northern Utah, {{the winter}} snow pack {{predominantly}} determines the water availability for the agricultural growing season. During {{the growing season}} the precipitation is generally scarce and infrequent. Irrigation is made possible through the capturing of snow <b>melt</b> in the <b>reservoirs</b> and/or diversions of runoff in the rivers. The spring runoff predictions are used by the irrigators to anticipate the seasonal water availability, and manage the farm and cropping pattern accordingly. Irrigation management and the decisions taken by irrigators differ depending on the quantity of water available. Irrigation scheduling and crop rotations are {{a few examples of}} irrigation management subject to change depending on the availability of water. These management decisions impact the ET and the runoff from the system and ultimately the regional hydrology. These components of the water balance can be evaluated using remote sensing, irrigation diversions, and water flow data. This study examines the irrigation management and performance of the Bear River Canal Company, which is an agricultural irrigation district located in Northern Utah. This region is characterized by a cycle of wet and dry years, which makes it possible to compare the performance at different levels of water availability. Satellite imagery from the past decade covers a few dry years (for example 2004), wet years (for example 2011) and normal years (for example 2009). The two source energy balance model (TSM) is used to estimate the ET of this agricultural area throughout the irrigation season. Further calculations are performed to determine the irrigation efficiency and depleted fraction of this irrigation system, using canal diversion data. The results from this study give insight on the management and performance of irrigation systems at different levels of water availability. This information will be relevant to decision-makers to understand the current trends in irrigation management and modifications that need to be made to cope with potential influences of climate change in this region...|$|R

40|$|Campi Flegrei caldera, {{within the}} Neapolitan area of Italy, is {{potentially}} {{one of the}} most dangerous volcanoes in the world, and during the last decade it has shown clear signs of reactivation, marked by the onset of uplift and changes in the geochemistry of gas emissions. We describe a 30 -year-long data set of the CO 2 –He–Ar–N 2 compositions of fumarolic emissions from La Solfatara crater, which is located in the center of the caldera. The data display continuous decreases in both the N 2 /He and N 2 /CO 2 ratios since 1985, paralleled by an increase in He/CO 2. These variations cannot be explained by either processes of boiling/condensation in the local hydrothermal system or with changes in the mixing proportions between a magmatic vapor and hydrothermal fluids. We applied the magma degassing model of Nuccio and Paonita (2001, Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 193, 467 – 481) using the most recent inert-gas solubilities in order to interpret these peculiar features in accordance with petrologic constraints derived from the ranges of the <b>melt</b> compositions and <b>reservoir</b> pressures at Campi Flegrei. The model simulations for mafic melts (trachybasalt and shoshonite) show a remarkably good agreement with the measured data. Both decompressive degassing of an ascending magma and mixing between magmatic fluids exsolved at various levels along the ascent path can explain the long-term geochemical changes. Recalling that (i) a sill-like reservoir of gases at a depth of 3 – 4 km seems to be the main source of ground inflation and (ii) there is petrologic and geophysical evidence for a reservoir of magma at about 8 km below Campi Flegrei, we suggest that the most-intense episodes of inflation occur when the gas supply to the sill-like reservoir comes from the 8 km-deep magma, although fluids exsolved by magma bodies at shallower depths also contribute to the gas budget. Our work highlights that, in caldera systems where the presence of hydrothermal aquifers commonly masks the magmatic signature of reactive volatiles, inert gases are the preferred species to use when seeking information on the melt composition, dynamics, and structure of the plumbing systems...|$|R
40|$|Analyses of enriched mantle (EM) -basalts, using lithophile element-based isotope systems, {{have long}} {{provided}} evidence for discrete mantle reservoirs with variable composition. Upon partial <b>melting,</b> the mantle <b>reservoir</b> imparts its isotopic fingerprint upon the partial melt produced. However, it has increasingly been recognised {{that it may}} not be simple to delimit these previously well-defined mantle reservoirs; the “mantle zoo” may contain more reservoirs than previously envisaged. Here we demonstrate that a simple model with varying contributions from two populations of compositionally distinct mantle sulphides can readily account for the observed heterogeneities in Os isotope systematics of such basalts without additional mantle reservoirs. Osmium elemental and isotopic analyses of individual sulphide grains separated from spinel lherzolites from Kilbourne Hole, New Mexico, USA demonstrate that two discrete populations of mantle sulphide exist in terms of both Re–Os systematics and textural relationship with co-existing silicates. One population, with a rounded morphology, is preserved in silicate grains and typically possesses high [Os] and low [Re] with unradiogenic, typically sub-chondritic 187 Os/ 188 Os attributable to long term isolation in a low-Re environment. By contrast, irregular-shaped sulphides, preserved along silicate grain boundaries, possess low [Os], higher [Re] and a wider range of, but generally supra-chondritic 187 Os/ 188 Os ([Os] typically ⩽ 1 – 2 ppm, 187 Os/ 188 Os ⩽ 0. 3729; this study). This population is thought to represent metasomatic sulphide. Uncontaminated silicate phases contain negligible Os (< 100 ppt) therefore the Os elemental and isotope composition of basalts is dominated by volumetrically insignificant sulphide ([Os] ⩽ 37 ppm; this study). During the early stages of partial melting, supra-chondritic interstitial sulphides are mobilised and incorporated into the melt, adding their radiogenic 187 Os/ 188 Os signature. Only when sulphides armoured within silicates are exposed to the melt through continued partial melting will enclosed sulphides add their high [Os] and unradiogenic 187 Os/ 188 Os to the aggregate melt. Platinum-group element data for whole rocks are also consistent with this scenario. The sequence of (i) addition of all of the metasomatic sulphide, followed by (ii) the incorporation of small amounts of armoured sulphide can thus account for the range of both [Os] and 187 Os/ 188 Os of EM-basalts worldwide without the need for contributions from additional silicate mantle reservoirs...|$|R
40|$|The 2010 {{eruption}} of Merapi (VEI 4) was the volcano’s largest since 1872. In {{contrast to the}} prolonged and effusive dome-forming eruptions typical of Merapi’s recent activity, the 2010 eruption began explosively, before a new dome was rapidly emplaced. This new dome was subsequently destroyed by explosions, generating pyroclastic density currents (PDCs), predominantly consisting of dark coloured, dense blocks of basaltic andesite dome lava. A shift towards open-vent conditions in the later stages of the eruption culminated in multiple explosions and the generation of PDCs with conspicuous grey scoria and white pumice clasts resulting from sub-plinian convective column collapse. This paper presents geochemical data for melt inclusions and their clinopyroxene hosts extracted from dense dome lava, grey scoria and white pumice generated during {{the peak of the}} 2010 eruption. These are compared with clinopyroxene-hosted melt inclusions from scoriaceous dome fragments from the prolonged dome-forming 2006 eruption, to elucidate any relationship between pre-eruptive degassing and crystallisation processes and eruptive style. Secondary ion mass spectrometry analysis of volatiles (H 2 O, CO 2) and light lithophile elements (Li, B, Be) is augmented by electron microprobe analysis of major elements and volatiles (Cl, S, F) in melt inclusions and groundmass glass. Geobarometric analysis shows that the clinopyroxene phenocrysts crystallised at depths of up to 20 km, with the greatest calculated depths associated with phenocrysts from the white pumice. Based on their volatile contents, melt inclusions have re-equilibrated during shallower storage and/or ascent, at depths of ~ 0. 6 – 9. 7 km, where the Merapi magma system is interpreted to be highly interconnected and not formed of discrete magma <b>reservoirs.</b> <b>Melt</b> inclusions enriched in Li show uniform “buffered” Cl concentrations, indicating the presence of an exsolved brine phase. Boron-enriched inclusions also support the presence of a brine phase, which helped to stabilise B in the melt. Calculations based on S concentrations in melt inclusions and groundmass glass require a degassing melt volume of 0. 36 km 3 in order to produce the mass of SO 2 emitted during the 2010 eruption. This volume is approximately an order of magnitude higher than the erupted magma (DRE) volume. The transition between the contrasting eruptive styles in 2010 and 2006 is linked to changes in magmatic flux and changes in degassing style, with the explosive activity in 2010 driven by an influx of deep magma, which overwhelmed the shallower magma system and ascended rapidly, accompanied by closed-system degassing...|$|R
40|$|Over time high K/Ca {{continental}} crust {{produces a}} unique Ca isotopic reservoir, with measurable 40 Ca excesses compared to Earth's mantle (Ca= 0). Thus, values of Cai > 1 indicate a significant crustal {{contribution to a}} magma. Values of Cai (< 1) indistinguishable from mantle Ca indicate that the Ca in those magmas is either directly from the mantle, or is from partial melting of newly formed crust. So, whereas 40 Ca excesses clearly define crustal contributions, mantle-like 40 Ca/ 44 Ca ratios are not as definitive. Here we present Ca isotopic measurements of intermediate to felsic igneous rocks from the western United States, and two crustal xenoliths found within the Fish Canyon Tuff (FCT). The two crustal xenoliths found within the 28. 2 Ma FCT of the southern Rocky Mountain volcanic field (SRMVF) yield Ca values of ~ 4 and ~ 7. 5, respectively. The 40 Ca excesses of these possible source rocks are due to long-term in situ 40 K decay and suggest that they are Precambrian in age. However, the FCT (Cai ~ 0. 3) is within uncertainty of the mantle 40 Ca/ 44 Ca. Together, these data indicate that little Precambrian crust {{was involved in the}} petrogenesis of the FCT. Nd isotopic analyses of the FCT imply that it was generated from 10 - 75 % of an enriched component, and the Ca isotopic data appear to restrict that component to newly formed lower crust, or enriched mantle. However, the Ca isotopic data do permit assimilation of some crust with low Ca/Nd; decreasing the 143 Nd/ 144 Nd without adding much excess 40 Ca to the FCT. Several other large tuffs from the SRMVF and from Yellowstone have Cai indistinguishable from the mantle. However, a few large tuffs from the SRMVF show significant 40 Ca excesses. These tuffs (Wall Mountain, Blue Mesa, and Grizzly Peak) are likely sourced from near, or within the Colorado Mineral Belt. New isotopic measurements of Mesozoic and Tertiary granites from across the northern Great Basin show a range of Cai from 0 to ~ 3. In these samples Cai is generally correlated with Sri and is broadly negatively correlated with Ndi. However, for granites with similar Ndi at a given general location Cai can vary significantly (1 to 2 epsilon units). In rocks where low Ndi could also be due to <b>melting</b> from enriched <b>reservoirs</b> in the mantle lithosphere, the combination of high Cai with low Ndi clearly identifies crustal melts...|$|R
40|$|Thirty-two new {{single crystal}} ages {{document}} 400 000 years of widespread explosive volcanism of historically active Nemrut Volcano towering over huge alkaline Lake Van (Eastern Anatolia). The dated deposits {{were selected to}} monitor the volcanic and compositional evolution of Nemrut Volcano through time and thus to provide a rigorous temporal framework for the tephra record of the PaleoVan Drilling Project. Tephra samples were taken from large-volume deposits or those that occur in medial to distal localities, well-exposed stratigraphic sections or from the initial phase of an eruptive sequence. Mainly fallout deposits were chosen because most ignimbrites show more complex and corroded feldspar populations owing to compositional zoning and magma mixing. Moreover, fallout deposits held the promise to be more clearly identifiable with-and correlatable to-> 300 tephra layers in the PaleoVan drill cores, even though commonly in amounts marginal or insufficient in thickness to allow well-supported single crystal dating. The crystals dated are dominantly anorthoclase, the main phenoctyst phase in the trachytic to rhyolitic, slightly to strongly peralkaline Nemrut magmas. Ages obtained so far range from ca. 400 ka to ca. 30 ka for Nemrut Volcano. The causes of {{significant changes in the}} frequency, volume and composition of tephra layers per unit time are discussed in terms of external (erosion, climate changes, geodynamic factors) and internal forcing (changes in magma supply and composition and incubation periods preceding large volume rhyolitic eruptions). For example, the low frequency of tephra layers deposited prior to ca. 200 ka may be due to low explosive activity, severe erosion between MIS 9 and MIS 11, or both. Nevertheless, the overall frequency of explosive eruptions appears to have increased during the past ca. 200 ka. We also recognize a slight peak in explosive eruptions during warm periods (e. g. MIS 5 and MIS 7) and speculate on lithospheric unloading triggering increased partial <b>melting</b> or magma <b>reservoir</b> unloading following massive glacier melting. The ages of 5 dated ignimbrites span ca. 250 000 years suggesting that Nemrut Volcano went through a polycyclic evolution with multiple caldera collapses and major pyroclastic flow eruptions, the oldest dated so far as 265 ka. The widely held view of the impressive Nemrut Caldera now dated to have formed at ca. 30 ka, as the main paroxysmal event during the evolution of the volcano is no longer tenable. Distinct and coherent compositional characteristics, especially in trace element concentrations, characterize several groups of trachytic tephras. We speculate that the growth of Nemrut Volcano caused the isolation of the Lake Van basin. On account of their mineralogical (anorthoclase, hedenbergite, fayalite, aenigmatite) and alkalic chemical compositions and large volume, dated Nemrut fallout tephras are likely to represent excellent markers in lakes and other sites of paleoclimatological or archeological interest in neighboring countries to the northeast of Lake Van as far as the Caspian Sea in what may be called the East Anatolian Tephra Provinc...|$|R
