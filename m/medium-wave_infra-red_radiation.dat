40|$|The authors {{show that}} the mean global {{temperature}} – and, therefore, climate – is determined mainly by the reflected portion of the total heat received from the Sun. The heat reflected directly by <b>infra-red</b> <b>radiation</b> is insufficient for maintenance of the temperature necessary for the Earth life, since it is limited by absorption windows created by green-house gases (mainly water molecules). The deficient heat is transported by a strong vertical convective air stream – {{a component of the}} total air circulation. This heat – limited only by Newton’s law – is delivered to the upper troposphere layers not containing water molecules, from where it is dissipated, practically unlimitedly, at the <b>infra-red</b> <b>radiation</b> wavelengths corresponding to cooled media. The convection, in compliance with Newton’s law, creates a negative feed-back, which stabilizes the processes of temperature changes on the Earth reducing them by half...|$|R

40|$|The Inkjet {{printing}} {{technology is a}} direct patterning technique to deposit functional materials with high precision and accuracy. This deposition technology {{is often used to}} manufacture conductive electrodes for different active and passive electronic devices on flexible foils. It is an up-scalable process in terms of printing devices from low (via. Sheet-to-Sheet, S 2 S platform) to high (via. Roll-to-Roll platform) quantities. For manufacturing of these conductive electrodes and hence electronic devices through the R 2 R platform, a suitable post-treatment/curing methodology is very much desired. In this work, the focus is concentrated on the curing methodology using the <b>Infra-red</b> <b>radiation</b> for both the inkjet-printed conductive electrodes and insulator layer, for completing a “proof of concept” Metal-Insulator-Metal (MIM) electronic device structure over the R 2 R platform. A conductive silver nano-particle and a polymeric dielectric ink are used to print the top and bottom conductive electrodes, with a middle insulator layer for the MIM structure respectively. It is observed that not only the printed silver electrode layers (both top and bottom) can be cured {{with the help of the}} <b>Infra-red</b> <b>radiation,</b> but also the insulator layer. Additionally, the layers constituting the MIM device structure is cured with the conventional curing methodology which in this case is thermal curing using a convection oven. This curing procedure for the printed functional layers is generally performed for the S 2 S manufacturing process. The conductive electrodes are then electrically characterized by measuring the sheet resistance (on the foil and dielectric layer) as a function of the un-conventional <b>Infra-red</b> <b>radiation</b> and conventional oven curing methodologies. The cured layers for both the conductive electrodes and insulator layers are morphologically analyzed for the layer thickness and homogeneity. The electrical performance of the cured insulator in form of the obtained capacitance from the MIM passive device is compared for the two mentioned curing methodologies...|$|R
5000|$|The {{photothermal}} mechanism manifests itself, {{besides the}} photoacoustic effect, also by other physical changes, notably emission of <b>infra-red</b> <b>radiation</b> {{and changes in}} the refraction index. Correspondingly, it may be detected by various other means, described by terms such as [...] "photothermal radiometry", [...] "thermal lens" [...] and [...] "thermal beam deflection" [...] (popularly also known as [...] "mirage" [...] effect) (see Photothermal spectroscopy. These methods parallel the photoacoustic detection. However, each method has its special range of application.|$|R

50|$|After the {{detection}} of <b>infra-red</b> <b>radiation</b> by William Herschel in 1800 and of Ultraviolet radiation by Johann Wilhelm Ritter, solar spectrometry began in 1817 when William Hyde Wollaston noticed that dark lines appeared in the solar spectrum when viewed through a glass prism. Joseph von Fraunhofer later independently discovered the lines and they were named Fraunhofer lines after him. Other physicists discerned that properties of the solar atmosphere could be determined from them. Notable scientists to advance spectroscopy were David Brewster, Gustav Kirchhoff, Robert Wilhelm Bunsen and Anders Jonas Ångström.|$|R
40|$|An {{electromagnetic}} wake of <b>infra-red</b> <b>radiation</b> can {{be generated}} by an intense laser pulse, propagating through an underdense plasma {{in the presence of}} a magnetostactic undulator. As opposed to undulator radiation from a charged bunch propagating in a periodic magnetic field, here radiation comes from almost stationary plasma electrons, ponderomotively pushed by the laser pulse. Such laser-driven undulator radiation can be produced by either a single ultra-short pulse, or by two frequency-detuned long pulses. In the latter case the difference frequency is efficiently produced by quasi phase-matched optical heterodyning...|$|R
