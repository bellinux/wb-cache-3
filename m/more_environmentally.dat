5|$|The {{advanced}} {{clean car}} rules program {{was made to}} reduce tail pipe emissions. The Air Resources Board approved the program to control emissions for newer models from the year 2017 to 2025. Some of their goals by 2025 are to have <b>more</b> <b>environmentally</b> superior cars to be available in different models and different types of cars. New automobiles will emit 34 percent fewer global warming gases and 75 percent fewer smog-forming emissions. And if fully implemented consumers can save an average of $6,000 {{over the life of}} the car.|$|E
5|$|The {{trend towards}} more {{intensive}} farming {{began to be}} partially reversed {{by the end of}} the century as <b>more</b> <b>environmentally</b> friendly practices were encouraged by government and European Union grants. For example, Richard Zawadzki, owner of Balfour Mains (the largest farm on the island), ceased to breed livestock (instead keeping animals bred elsewhere) and grew less grain (some barley is still grown on the farm). Instead, some of the land is now managed under a Habitat Creation Scheme, which aims to encourage natural vegetation, wild flowers and nesting birds by limiting grazing and reducing the use of chemical fertilisers.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{its lack}} of {{commercial}} success {{when it was first}} released, the C5 gained an unexpected degree of cult status in the later years. Collectors began purchasing them as investment items, reselling them for considerably more than their original retail price. One such investor, Adam Harper, bought 600 C5s from a film company as a speculative investment in 1987. He sold all but four within two years, selling them to customers who wanted a novel or <b>more</b> <b>environmentally</b> friendly form of transportation. He also found willing customers among drivers who had been banned from the road, as the C5 did not need a driving licence or vehicle tax. According to Harper, C5s could be resold for as much as £2,500 – more than six times the original retail price. By 1996, a Special Edition C5 in its original box was reported to be worth more than £5,000 to collectors.|$|E
5|$|In road {{snow and}} ice control, brine is often used as an anti-icer rather than a de-icer. A vehicle carries a tank of brine, which is sprayed on the road surface before or {{at the onset of}} the storm. This keeps {{snow and ice}} from {{adhering}} to the surface and makes mechanical removal by plows easier. Solid salt is also wetted with brine or other liquid deicer. This speeds de-icing action and helps keep it from bouncing off the pavement into the gutter or ditch. Brine acts faster than solid salt and does not require compression by passing traffic to become effective. The brine is also <b>more</b> <b>environmentally</b> friendly, as less salt is required to treat the same length of road.|$|E
5|$|Just to {{the south}} of the castle is the {{restored}} 18th-century castle watermill. In 2010 the castle received 128,242 visitors. Dunster Castle has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building and Scheduled Ancient Monument. The castle has required continuing maintenance work, in particular to its roof, itself an important historical feature. Efforts have been made to gradually redecorate the castle in a period style, using reproductions of original wallpapers and materials. The National Trust installed solar panels behind the battlements on the roof in 2008 to provide electricity and make the premises <b>more</b> <b>environmentally</b> friendly. This {{was the first time the}} National Trust have taken this approach to a Grade I listed building, and it is expected to save 1,714kg (3,778lb) of carbon a year. In 2015, the National Trust announced plans to make the 19th-century reservoir open to the public.|$|E

5|$|Some of the cleaner energy {{facilities}} in Boston include the Allston green district, with three ecologically compatible housing facilities. Boston is also breaking ground on multiple green affordable housing facilities {{to help reduce}} the carbon footprint of the city while simultaneously making these initiatives financially available to a greater population. Boston's climate plan is updated every three years and was most recently modified in 2013. This legislature includes the Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance, which requires the city's larger buildings to disclose their yearly energy and water use statistics and partake in an energy assessment every five years. These statistics are made public by the city, thereby increasing incentives for buildings to be <b>more</b> <b>environmentally</b> conscious.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{problems}} for filming is the environmental impact they would cause, particularly with explosions. Location manager Jaco Espach often coordinated with a special effects team to use <b>more</b> <b>environmentally</b> friendly methods. In order to film sequences involving firearms and explosives in private property, the series crew often negotiated with property owners, as well as notifying all neighbouring properties, local police and the local hospital. In the city, leaflets were distributed to the filming location a week in advance. In airport scenes, the crew would inform the aviation authorities. The action sequences {{in the beginning of the}} first episode took five days to shoot, and was filmed in the Johannesburg suburb of Yeoville. On the scenes filmed on the Kalahari, filming temporarily halted due to the spotting of venomous snakes in the area. After they retreated from some rainfall, the crew swept the area to remove them and filming continued.|$|E

25|$|Green {{biotechnology}} is biotechnology {{applied to}} agricultural processes. An {{example would be}} the selection and domestication of plants via micropropagation. Another example is the designing of transgenic plants to grow under specific environments in the presence (or absence) of chemicals. One hope is that green biotechnology might produce <b>more</b> <b>environmentally</b> friendly solutions than traditional industrial agriculture. An {{example of this is}} the engineering of a plant to express a pesticide, thereby ending the need of external application of pesticides. An example of this would be Bt corn. Whether or not green biotechnology products such as this are ultimately <b>more</b> <b>environmentally</b> friendly is a topic of considerable debate.|$|E

40|$|Architecture uses {{technology}} to achieve certain functional, cultural, social, economic, and other goals. In turn, technology transforms the discipline. Information technologies promise to change design processes, practices, and products. The first uses of computing {{in the service}} of architecture have been rather timid, mimicking older practices. This is changing rapidly: new design and evaluation tools allow architects to imagine new building forms, <b>more</b> responsive (and <b>environmentally</b> <b>more</b> responsible) buildings, even radically new types of environments that blend physical with virtual space.
