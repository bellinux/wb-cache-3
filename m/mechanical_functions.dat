We {{hypothesized}} that {{the time course of}} the recovery of atrial systolic function {{may be related to the}} duration of atrial fibrillation before cardioversion and sought to study noninvesively the recovery of left atrial <b>mechanical</b> <b>function</b> utilizing serial transthoracic Doppler studies. Background. Recovery of atrial <b>mechanical</b> <b>function</b> may be delayed for several weeks after successful cardioversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. Methods. After successful cardioversion, 60 patients with atrial fibrillation of brief (≤ 2 week, 17 patients), moderate (> 2 to 6 weeks, 22 patients) or prolonged (> 6 weeks, 21 patients) duration were followed up with serial transmitral pulsed Doppler echocardiography immediately (60 patients) and at 24 h (45 patients), 1 week (41 patients), 1 month (31 patients) and > 3 months (30 patients) after cardioversion. Results. Atrial <b>mechanical</b> <b>function</b> is greater immediately and at 24 h and 1 week after cardioversion in patients with “brief” compared with “prolonged” atrial fibrillation. In all groups, atrial <b>mechanical</b> <b>function</b> increases over time, ultimately achieving similar levels. Full recovery of atrial <b>mechanical</b> <b>function,</b> however, is achieved within 24 h in patients with brief atrial fibrillation, within 1 week in patients with moderate-duration atrial fibrillation and within 1 month in patients with prolonged atrial fibrillation. Conclusions. Recovery of left atrial <b>mechanical</b> <b>function</b> is related to the duration of atrial fibrillation before cardioversion. These findings have important implications for assessing the early hemodynamic benefit of successful cardioversion...|$|R

We hypothesized that beating heart radiofrequency left atrial ablation would result in minimal acute changes in left atrial hemodynamics. MethodsSix healthy subjects were studied. Combination pressure-conductance catheters were inserted into the left atrium and ventricle. With the use of the device, atrial ablation was performed on the beating heart without cardiopulmonary bypass, including electrical isolation of the posterior left atrium and atrial appendage myocardium. Simultaneous left-sided heart pressure–volume and intracardiac echocardiography data were acquired before ablation, after left atrial appendage ablation alone, and after all ablation (with and without appendage occlusion). The derived indices of left-sided heart <b>mechanical</b> <b>function</b> were examined. ResultsRelative to baseline, no significant diminishment in pressure–volume or intracardiac echocardiography-derived indices of global left-sided heart <b>mechanical</b> <b>function</b> were observed after ablation, with or without appendage occlusion.

A significant diminishment of atrial appendage systolic flow was noted after appendage ablation in association with spontaneous echocardiographic contrast in this region. ConclusionsIn this model, ablation does not seem to compromise global left-sided heart <b>mechanical</b> <b>function.</b> However, these findings mask regional diminishment in atrial appendage systolic function.

40|$|Appropriate <b>mechanical</b> <b>function</b> of the uterine cervix is {{critical}} for maintaining a pregnancy to term so that the fetus can develop fully. At the end of pregnancy, however, the cervix must allow delivery, which requires it to markedly soften, shorten and dilate. There are multiple pathways to spontaneous preterm birth, the leading global {{cause of death in}} children less than 5 years old, but all culminate in premature cervical change, because that is the last step in the final common pathway to delivery. The mechanisms underlying premature cervical change in pregnancy are poorly understood, and therefore current clinical protocols to assess preterm birth risk are limited to surrogate markers of <b>mechanical</b> <b>function,</b> such as sonographically measured cervical length.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} left atrial <b>mechanical</b> <b>function</b> recovery and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) release following successful cardioversion of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). BackgroundAtrial fibrillation is characterized by functional deterioration, loss of atrial contraction, and elevation of plasma ANP levels. The response of ANP release toward atrial <b>mechanical</b> <b>function</b> after cardioversion of AF has not been fully examined. MethodsWe examined 29 patients with successfully cardioverted persistent AF in whom sinus rhythm was maintained for at least 30 days after cardioversion. We assessed <b>mechanical</b> <b>function</b> of the left atrium at 24 h and 7 and 30 days after cardioversion and evaluated plasma ANP level at the same time. Atrial <b>mechanical</b> <b>function</b> was assessed during echocardiographic examination by means of the peak velocity of the transmitral A-wave, early transmitral to atrial flow velocity ratio, and atrial filling fraction (AFF). The plasma ANP level was determined by the radioimmunoassay method. ResultsPlasma ANP levels were significantly reduced from 59. 4 ± 16. 6 pg/ml to 31. 1 ± 9. 2 pg/ml at 24 h after successful cardioversion. Within 30 days, we noted progressive improvement of atrial systolic function (increase in AFF from 21 % to 31 %, p < 0. 05). At the same time, plasma ANP levels gradually increased from 31. 1 ± 9. 2 pg/ml at 24 h to 36. 9 ± 12. 8 pg/ml on day 30 following cardioversion (p < 0. 05). ConclusionsPlasma ANP levels significantly decreased in patients with persistent AF after successful cardioversion. In the 30 days after cardioversion, gradual elevation of plasma ANP concentration was observed concomitantly with an increase of AFF. Plasma ANP release after successful cardioversion of persistent AF might be due to recovery of atrial <b>mechanical</b> <b>function...</b>|$|R

40|$|The need to {{regenerate}} tissue is paramount, {{especially for the}} heart that lacks the ability {{to regenerate}} after injury. The urinary bladder extracellular matrix (ECM), when used to repair a right ventricular defect, successfully regenerated some <b>mechanical</b> <b>function.</b> The objective {{of the current study}} was to determine whether the regenerative effect of ECM could be improved by seeding the patch with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) enhanced to differentiate down a cardiac linage. hMSCs were used to form three-dimensional spheroids. The expression of cardiac proteins was determined in cells exposed to the spheroid formation and compared with nonmanipulated hMSCs. To determine whether functional calcium channels were present, the cells were patch clamped. To evaluate the ability of these cells to regenerate <b>mechanical</b> <b>function,</b> the spheroids were seeded on ECM and then implanted into the canine heart to repair a full-thickness right ventricular defect. As a result, many of the cells spreading from the spheroids expressed cardiac-specific proteins, including sarcomeric α-actinin, cardiotin, and atrial natriuretic peptide, as well as the cell cycle markers cyclin D 1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. A calcium current similar in amplitude to that of ventricular myocytes was present in 16 % of the cells. The cardiogenic cell-seeded scaffolds increased the regional <b>mechanical</b> <b>function</b> in the canine heart compared with the unmanipulated hMSC-seeded scaffolds. In addition, the cells prelabeled with fluorescent markers demonstrated myocyte-specific actinin staining with sarcomere spacing similar to that of normal myocytes. In conclusion, the spheroid-derived cells express cardiac-specific proteins and demonstrate a calcium current similar to adult ventricular myocytes. When these cells are implanted into the canine heart, some of these cells appear striated and <b>mechanical</b> <b>function</b> is improved compared with the unmanipulated hMSCs. Further investigation will be required to determine whether the increased <b>mechanical</b> <b>function</b> is due to a differentiation of the cardiogenic cells to myocytes or to other effects...|$|R

40|$|Changes in <b>mechanical</b> <b>function</b> in {{the heart}} {{have been shown to}} be {{associated}} with different mechanisms of heart failure. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>function</b> is disrupted in dyssynchronous heart failure, as the timing of contraction in altered in different regions of the heart, preventing a uniform contraction. This dyssynchrony can be simulated using regional ventricular pacing, which also alters <b>mechanical</b> <b>function.</b> One purpose of the work presented here was to determine the effects of the altered cardiac muscle mechanics that arise due to regional ventricular pacing. It was found that a prestretch associated with dyssynchronous contraction can affect tension and work production in isolated cardiac muscle. The timing and magnitude of this stretch was also found to be of importance. Ultimately, the results could mostly be explained by a few well known muscle mechanics mechanisms: time-varying stiffness, the force-velocity relation, and shortening deactivation. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is another cause of heart failure, which can be brought about by mechanical dysfunction. The work presented here proposes a novel mechanism for contractile dysfunction associated with cardiac vinculin deletion, which is a precursor to dilated cardiomyopathy. It was shown that an increase in lattice spacing due to vinculin deletion increased transverse systolic stiffness and explains the altered systolic wall strains associated with vinculin deficiency.
