500|$|Act II {{begins with}} Midas enamored {{with his new}} power of turning things to gold. However, his courtiers {{complain}} of being forced to wear heavy golden clothing. Midas rebukes them, saying [...] "I am a God!". But Midas himself begins to experience the problems of turning everything he touches to gold: he cannot eat, for example. He starts to regret his wish, saying [...] "Oh! fool! to wish to change all things to gold! / Blind Ideot that I was!". Midas prays to Bacchus to take away his power, begging [...] "Make me a hind, clothe me in ragged skins— / And let <b>my</b> <b>food</b> be bread, unsavoury roots, / But take from me the frightful curse of gold". Midas has his courtiers sacrifice to the gods {{to see if he}} can be relieved of his curse; Bacchus relents and tells him to bathe in the river. The courtiers find it strange that he does not remove his crown while he swims; one of them resolves to peek under his crown while he is sleeping. Returning from his swim, Midas celebrates nature, saying gold [...] "is a sordid, base and dirty thing;— / Look at the grass, the sky, the trees, the flowers, / These are Joves treasures & they are not gold".|$|E

When he was shooting the scene where he and McDonnell eat at a Chinese restaurant, Robinson told him he could do anything he wanted to make her laugh. [...] "Dangerous words. It set the tone for the rest of the shoot," [...] he recalls. [...] "I played with <b>my</b> <b>food.</b> I made up lines (including one about pounding chicken breasts in the kitchen during our second date)." [...] The rest of the cast and crew felt similarly. Near the end of the shoot Robinson said the only way it could have been better would have been if the lab lost the film, so they would have had to do it all over again.|$|E

2500|$|The Transformer {{brothers}} {{also knew}} where he was, but he didn't look and just held his pole steady. The brothers came and landed {{on the side of}} the canoe.

[...] He tells the three men, [...] "I have a house right here, right there in that little bay. You bring your canoe over and come up ashore." [...] He pulled up his pole and had a lot of the moss ready. In the house, he had a big fire ready and a mountain of rock underneath, already hot. He took some sticks and grabbed the hot rocks and put them in a bowl that was filled with water. When the rocks were dropped in, the water began to boil. He took the boiling water and placed the moss inside and then made soup. The tells the men to have a seat on his bench with his big hyu7kem plate. This was the first hyu7kem plate made because he knew these men were coming. It made this plate really fancy, and fed them with three Mountain Goat horn spoons. The three men ate the moss.|$|E
