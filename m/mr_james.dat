5|$|Lord Rosebery had {{purchased}} Craigiehall {{as a home}} for his second son Neil Primrose MP, {{who was killed in}} Gaza during the First World War. In 1926 Rosebery therefore decided to lease the house and policies, although the agricultural lands continue to be farmed as part of Lord Rosebery's neighbouring Dalmeny estate. The lease was taken by <b>Mr</b> <b>James</b> Morton, an Edinburgh textile manufacturer, who commissioned Robert Lorimer to make various alterations, the property having stood empty for ten years. Lorimer added the oriel window on the south front, and modernised many of Bruce's remaining interiors. A water turbine was constructed in the bath house to provide electricity.|$|E

She also inquired about local hotels. A few moments after their departure, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>James</b> {{received a phone call from}} a woman asking if [...] "Miss Virginia Carpenter" [...] was there. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>James</b> learned the next morning about Carpenter's disappearance and reported her sighting to the police.

25|$|During {{demolition}} it {{was noted}} that the stonework in the lower story of Chapelton (old) House was noticeably older than the upper story as would be expected if Laigh Chapelton had developed into Chapelton when it acquired an owner with greater financial means, <b>Mr.</b> <b>James</b> McAlister (or MacAlester), who added first a new 'mansion house', later an upper story to the old farm, developed the ornamental gardens and probably built the bridge over the river with the associated 'ha-ha' (see the section on the estate gardens and landscape).|$|E

Three portraits were exhibited in the artist's studio in the Tiffany and Company Building, those of <b>Mr.</b> and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>James</b> A. Baker and their daughter, of Houston, Texas.

50|$|The Court of Appeal decision, read by Mummery LJ, {{dismissed}} Mrs James’ {{appeal and}} held the tribunal was entitled to find <b>Mrs</b> <b>James</b> was not the council’s employee, because there was neither an express nor an implied contract.

To imply a contract a tribunal must ask whether {{it is necessary to}} do so, and the tribunal was not perverse in holding it was unnecessary. The council providing work, its payments to the employment agency and the performance of work by <b>Mrs</b> <b>James</b> were all explained by their respective express contracts with the agency.|$|R
