5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless {{body fluid}} {{found in the}} brain and spinal cord. It is {{produced}} in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the brain, and absorbed in the arachnoid granulations. There is about 125mL of CSF at any one time, and about 500mL is generated every day. CSF acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain, providing basic <b>mechanical</b> <b>and</b> immunological protection to the brain inside the skull. The CSF also serves a vital function in cerebral autoregulation of cerebral blood flow.|$|E

5|$|Groves and {{the wartime}} {{director}} of the Los Alamos Laboratory, Robert Oppenheimer, had begun the move of ordnance functions to Sandia in late 1945. The laboratory's ordnance engineering division, known as Z Division, after its first director, Jerrold R. Zacharias, was split between Los Alamos and Sandia. Between March and July 1946, Z Division relocated to Sandia, except for its mechanical engineering (Z-4) section, which followed in February 1947. Z Division worked on improving the <b>mechanical</b> <b>and</b> electrical reliability of the Mark 3 Fat Man bomb, but this work was disrupted by the Crossroads tests.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to water, <b>mechanical,</b> <b>and</b> candle clocks, incense clocks {{were used in}} the Far East, and were fashioned in several different forms. Incense clocks were first used in China around the 6th century; in Japan, one still exists in the Shōsōin, although its characters are not Chinese, but Devanagari. Due to their frequent use of Devanagari characters, suggestive of their use in Buddhist ceremonies, Edward H. Schafer speculated that incense clocks were invented in India. Although similar to the candle clock, incense clocks burned evenly and without a flame; therefore, they were more accurate and safer for indoor use.|$|E

In order to accommodate newly added French and Latin classes, Manual was expanded to a four-year school in 1901. In 1911, Manual became the first school in Kentucky to serve lunches to students.|$|E
5|$|Mechanical gun games {{existed before}} the {{emergence}} of electronic video games, {{as far back as}} the 1920s. The first light guns appeared in the 1930s, with the Seeburg Ray-O-Lite. Games using this toy rifle were <b>mechanical</b> <b>and</b> the rifle fired beams of light at targets wired with sensors. These evolved throughout subsequent decades, culminating in games such as Sega's electro-mechanical arcade game Periscope, the company's first successful game, released in 1966. It required the player to target cardboard ships.|$|E

5|$|Rideau Cottage is a two-level, 22-room Georgian Revival building. Originally, the {{structure}} had 14 rooms {{on a single}} floor. An 1872 remodel, using a different brick, added both the second level and a verandah on three sides of the ground floor. During that remodel, the exterior brick of the first floor was covered in stucco painted to appear like brick. (When the verandah was removed some time later, the stucco remained.) Between 1999 and 2000, the building underwent major renovations to the basement, roof and interior finishes, and the <b>mechanical</b> <b>and</b> electrical systems were upgraded. Outside, the stucco was removed and each brick and joint was individually dyed to give a uniform appearance. It was again renovated in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Subwoofer {{output level}} can be {{increased}} by increasing cone surface area or by increasing cone excursion. Since large drivers require undesirably large cabinets, most subwoofer drivers have large excursions. Unfortunately, high excursion, at high power levels, tends to produce more distortion from inherent <b>mechanical</b> <b>and</b> magnetic effects in electro-dynamic drivers (the most common sort). The conflict between assorted goals can never be fully resolved; subwoofer designs are necessarily compromises. Hofmans's Iron Law (the efficiency of a woofer system is directly proportional to its cabinet volume and to the cube of its cutoff frequency) applies to subwoofers just as to all loudspeakers.|$|E
