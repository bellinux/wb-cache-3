25|$|In <b>microwave</b> <b>ovens,</b> the {{waveguide}} {{leads to}} a radio frequency-transparent port into the cooking chamber.

This is not always effective for larger objects in the chamber, and most modern <b>microwave</b> <b>ovens</b> also include a rotating table for the food to sit on, called a turntable.|$|E

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of drying leaf samples using <b>microwave</b> <b>oven</b> on the foliar concentrations of macronutrients of brachiaria grass, cane sugar and guava. For this, a study was carried out in a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement, with three plant species and two drying methods, <b>microwave</b> <b>oven</b> and forced-air circulation oven, arranged in a randomized block design with six replications. Leaf samples were analyzed for determining their macronutrient levels. The drying methods did not affect foliar concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and magnesium in all three species studied.

25|$|At low frequencies, {{molecules}} in polar dielectrics are polarized by an applied electric field, which induces periodic rotations. For example, at the microwave frequency, the microwave field causes the periodic rotation of water molecules, sufficient to break hydrogen bonds. The field does {{work against the}} bonds and the energy is absorbed by the material as heat. This is why <b>microwave</b> <b>ovens</b> work very well for materials containing water. There are two maxima of the imaginary component (the absorptive index) of water, one at the microwave frequency, and the other at far ultraviolet (UV) frequency. Both of these resonances are at higher frequencies than the operating frequency of <b>microwave</b> <b>ovens.</b>|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s, Litton bought Studebaker's Franklin Manufacturing assets, {{which had}} been {{manufacturing}} magnetrons and building and selling <b>microwave</b> <b>ovens</b> similar to the Radarange. Litton then developed a new configuration of the microwave: the short, wide shape that is now common. The magnetron feed was also unique. This resulted in an oven that could survive a no-load condition: an empty microwave oven where {{there is nothing to}} absorb the microwaves. The new oven was shown at a trade show in Chicago, and helped begin a rapid growth of the market for home <b>microwave</b> <b>ovens.</b> Sales volume of 40,000 units for the U.S. industry in 1970 grew to one million by 1975.

40|$|AbstractComparison of drying {{characteristics}} of Thompson seedless grapes using combined <b>microwave</b> <b>oven</b> and hot air cabinet dryer was investigated. The drying rate curves indicated {{the absence of}} a constant-rate drying period in all drying methods. Within a certain microwave power range (75 – 900 W in the current study), increasing microwave power speeds up the drying process, thus shortening the drying time. No benefits were seen when increasing drying time from 30 to 120 min when grapes drying started in hot air cabinet dryer and finished in <b>microwave</b> <b>oven</b> for 1 min at any power level. The higher value of energy consumption during grapes drying belonged to hot air cabinet dryer alone as drying method with value of 564. 5 MJ/kgwater evaporated. The average total soluble solids was 90. 4 ° Brix when drying was achieved by <b>microwave</b> <b>oven</b> followed by hot air cabinet dryer, meanwhile, it was 90. 2 ° Brix when drying was achieved by hot air cabinet dryer followed by <b>microwave</b> <b>oven.</b> The total soluble solid was 92 ° Brix when drying process started and finished in hot air cabinet dryer alone. The average drying ratio was 4. 21 when drying was achieved by <b>microwave</b> <b>oven</b> followed by hot air cabinet dryer; meanwhile, it was 4. 19 when drying was achieved by hot air cabinet dryer followed by <b>microwave</b> <b>oven.</b> The hot air cabinet drying method had higher drying constant ‘k’ compared to the other two methods. The <b>microwave</b> <b>oven</b> followed by hot air cabinet dryer as a drying method achieved 78 % of the optimum selection percentage.
