Convective motion carries energy {{toward the surface}} through the <b>mass</b> <b>movement</b> of plasma. This mass of plasma carries {{a portion of the}} angular velocity of the star. When turbulence occurs through shear and rotation, the angular momentum can become redistributed to different latitudes through meridional flow.|$|E

5|$|In 1980 a {{political}} crisis emerged in Poland {{with the emergence}} of the Solidarity <b>mass</b> <b>movement.</b> By the end of October, Solidarity had 3 million members, and by December, had 9 million. In a public opinion poll organised by the Polish government, 89% of the respondents supported Solidarity. With the Polish leadership split on what to do, the majority did not want to impose martial law, as suggested by Wojciech Jaruzelski. The Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc was unsure how to handle the situation, but Erich Honecker of East Germany pressed for military action. In a formal letter to Brezhnev, Honecker proposed a joint military measure to control the escalating problems in Poland. A CIA report suggested the Soviet military were mobilising for an invasion.|$|E

5|$|Beginning with late 1987 the Caucasus {{region was}} {{experiencing}} {{a surge in}} political turmoil with large and near constant demonstrations being held {{in the capital of}} Yerevan beginning in February 1988. For the fifteen months prior to the earthquake and at times up to hundreds of thousands of protesters, represented by the Karabakh Committee, were demanding both democracy and the unification of Nagorno-Karabakh (administered by Soviet Azerbaijan but disputed autonomous territory with an 80% Armenian majority and the Azerbaijani minority) in the mountains of the Karabakh region. The unrest and the opposition movement began in September 1988 with negotiations between the Karabakh Committee and Gorbachev taking place throughout most of 1989. The relationship between the Soviet authorities and the Armenian society took {{a turn for the worse}} in March and the developments climaxed in November when a state of emergency was declared, along with a nighttime curfew, and a <b>mass</b> <b>movement</b> of up to 50,000 Armenians fleeing ethnic violence arrived from Azerbaijan.|$|E
5|$|Crispi was {{replaced}} {{as prime minister}} by Antonio Di Rudinì in February 1891, who was succeeded by Giovanni Giolitti in May 1892. On January 20, 1893, when peasants of Caltavuturo occupied communal land that they claimed was theirs, local authorities killed 13 and wounded 21 in the Caltavuturo massacre. Disturbances continued throughout the year. The Fasci started out as urban movements, animated by artisans, which evolved into a more popular and combative <b>mass</b> <b>movement</b> with the adherence of sulphur miners, and in a later stage with the involvement of peasants and sharecroppers. In the autumn of 1893, labour conflicts in the cities and the mines came together with the protests and claims of the farmers. The movement reached its greatest breadth in the manifestations against taxes, involving the lowest tiers {{of the city and}} the countryside, becoming difficult, if not impossible, to control by its leaders.|$|E
5|$|On 13 December 1981, {{claiming}} {{that the country was}} on the verge of economic and civil breakdown, and alleging a danger of Soviet intervention, General Wojciech Jaruzelski began a crack-down on Solidarity. Martial law was declared, the free labor union was suspended and most of its leaders detained. Several thousand citizens were interned or imprisoned and much larger numbers were subjected to various forms of harassment. Polish state militia (Milicja Obywatelska, the police) and paramilitary riot police ZOMO suppressed the strike action and demonstrations. Military forces entered industrial enterprises to clamp down on the independent union movement. A series of violent attacks included the pacification of Wujek Coal Mine during which 9 people were killed. The martial law offensive was directed primarily against workers and their Union; they, rather than intelligentsia activists, were the object of the most brutal treatment. The authorities succeeded in imposing on members of Solidarity an individual and collective trauma, from which the broken <b>mass</b> <b>movement</b> would not be able to recover. The Catholic Church strove to exert on Solidarity a moderating influence both before and after the martial law.|$|E

5000|$|While <b>mass</b> <b>movements</b> {{are usually}} some blend of nationalist, {{political}} and religious ideas, Hoffer argues there are two important commonalities: [...] "All <b>mass</b> <b>movements</b> are competitive" [...] and perceive the supply of converts as zero-sum; and [...] "all <b>mass</b> <b>movements</b> are interchangeable." [...] As examples of the interchangeable nature of <b>mass</b> <b>movements,</b> Hoffer cites how almost 2000 years ago Saul, a fanatical opponent of Christianity, became Paul, a fanatical apologist and promoter of Christianity. Another example occurred in Germany during the 1920s and the 1930s, when Communists and Fascists were ostensibly bitter enemies but in fact competed for {{the same type of}} angry, marginalized people; Nazis Adolf Hitler and Ernst Röhm, and Communist Karl Radek, all boasted of their prowess in converting their rivals.|$|R

25|$|As an {{avalanche}} moves down a slope it follows a certain pathway that {{is dependent on}} the slope's degree of steepness and the volume of snow/ice involved in the <b>mass</b> <b>movement.</b> The origin of {{an avalanche}} is called the Starting Point and typically occurs on a 30–45 degree slope. The body of the pathway is called the Track of the avalanche and usually occurs on a 20–30 degree slope. When the avalanche loses its momentum and eventually stops it reaches the Runout Zone. This usually occurs when the slope has reached a steepness that is less than 20 degrees. These degrees are not consistently true {{due to the fact that}} each avalanche is unique depending on the stability of the snowpack that it was derived from as well as the environmental or human influences that triggered the <b>mass</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E

40|$|An {{automated}} {{approach to}} identifying landslides {{using a combination}} of high-resolution satellite imagery and digital elevation derivatives is offered as an alternative to aerial photographic interpretation.

Dividing the classification by process into debris slides, debris flows, and rock slides makes the method far more useful than methods that group all <b>mass</b> <b>movements</b> together. A hierarchical classification scheme is utilized to eliminate areas that are not of interest and to identify areas where <b>mass</b> <b>movements</b> are probable. A supervised classification is then conducted using spectral, shape, and textural properties to identify failures that were greater than 1 ha in area. The resulting accuracy was 90 percent for debris slides, 60 percent for debris flows, and 80 percent for rock slides...|$|R
