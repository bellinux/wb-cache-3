5|$|Another study {{suggested}} that EFS {{might contribute to}} acute rheumatic fever susceptibility. In this work, peripheral blood <b>mononuclear</b> cells (PBMCs) from patients with rheumatoid heart disease (RHD) and control subjects that had never experienced acute rheumatoid fever were stimulated with rheumatogenic and non-rheumatogenic group A streptococci (GAS) strains. EFS {{was one of only}} four genes with significantly increased expression in both arms of the study: 1) RHD patient versus control PBMCs after stimulation of both groups with rheumatogenic GAS and 2) RHD patient PBMC stimulated with rheumatogenic versus non-rheumatogenic GAS.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} classification {{is based}} on Adl etal. 2005, while the classes and further divisions on Dykstra and Keller 2000, who included the Myxogastria in Mycetozoa. The sister taxon is the subclass Dictyostelia. Together with the Protostelia they formed the taxon of the Eumycetozoae. Other subclasses differ from the other species mainly {{in the development of}} fruit bodies; while Protostelia create a separate fruit body from each single <b>mononuclear</b> cell, Dictyostelia develop cell complexesthe so-called pseudo-plasmodiafrom separate cells, which then become fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|Viruses {{may reach}} the lung {{by a number}} of {{different}} routes. Respiratory syncytial virus is typically contracted when people touch contaminated objects and then they touch their eyes or nose. Other viral infections occur when contaminated airborne droplets are inhaled through the mouth or nose. Once in the upper airway, the viruses may make their way in the lungs, where they invade the cells lining the airways, alveoli, or lung parenchyma. Some viruses such as measles and herpes simplex may reach the lungs via the blood. The invasion of the lungs may lead to varying degrees of cell death. When the immune system responds to the infection, even more lung damage may occur. Primarily white blood cells, mainly <b>mononuclear</b> cells, generate the inflammation. As well as damaging the lungs, many viruses simultaneously affect other organs and thus disrupt other body functions. Viruses also make the body more susceptible to bacterial infections; in this way, bacterial pneumonia can arise as a co-morbid condition.|$|E
25|$|Pharmacodynamics are {{measured}} by measuring proteasome inhibition in peripheral blood <b>mononuclear</b> cells. The much greater sensitivity of myeloma cell lines and mantle cell lines to proteasome inhibition compared with normal peripheral blood <b>mononuclear</b> cells {{and most other}} cancer cell lines is poorly understood.|$|E
25|$|The manganate(IV) anion {{has been}} {{prepared}} by radiolysis of dilute solutions of permanganate. It is <b>mononuclear</b> in dilute solution, and shows a strong absorption in the ultraviolet and a weaker absorption at 650nm.|$|E
25|$|Interleukins {{are another}} {{potential}} family of scar-inducing cellular messengers. Particularly, interleukin-1, a protein produced by <b>mononuclear</b> phagocytes, helps {{to initiate the}} inflammatory response in astrocytes, leading to reactive astrogliosis {{and the formation of}} the glial scar.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, it {{was shown}} {{that the amount of}} {{telomerase}} activity significantly increased following psychological stress. Across the sample of patients telomerase activity in increased peripheral blood <b>mononuclear</b> cells by 18% one hour {{after the end of the}} stress.|$|E
25|$|Further, the {{offspring}} of semi-supercentenarians (subjects who reached an age of 105–109 years) have a lower epigenetic age than age-matched controls (age difference=5.1 years in peripheral blood <b>mononuclear</b> cells) and centenarians are younger (8.6 years) than expected based on their chronological age.|$|E
25|$|Microglia are {{specialized}} macrophages {{capable of}} phagocytosis that protect neurons {{of the central}} nervous system. They are derived from the earliest wave of <b>mononuclear</b> cells that originate in yolk sac blood islands early in development, and colonize the brain shortly after the neural precursors begin to differentiate.|$|E
25|$|Response to {{infection}} by Leishmania donovani varies a great deal, {{not only by}} the strength but also by the type of the patient's immune reaction. People with a history of infection by strains of leishmania that cause visceral leishmaniasis show a continuum of immune responses from protective to non-protective. Those who acquired protective immunity (skin test positive) without ever having visceral leishmaniasis have a strong type 1 CD4+ response to leishmania antigens. Antigen specific interferon-gamma and proliferation, as well as the ability to kill intracellular leishmania, are hallmarks of protective immunity. Because visceral leishmaniasis patients lack these responses to leishmania and other antigens, they usually die of secondary infections if left untreated. In addition, increased interleukin-10 secretion is characteristic of the disease. Addition of interleukin-12, anti-interleukin-10, or anti-interleukin-4 to peripheral blood <b>mononuclear</b> cells from acute patients sometimes increases interferon-gamma secretion and proliferation. Acute patient peripheral blood <b>mononuclear</b> cells include CD8+ T regulatory cells that decrease interferon-gamma secretion and proliferation responses to leishmania and other antigens and increase interleukin-10 secretion when added to autologous peripheral blood <b>mononuclear</b> cells harvested after successful treatment. Thus, the CD8+ T regulatory cells reproduce the immune response characteristic of visceral leishmaniasis. CD8+ T regulatory cells are also associated with post kala azar dermal leishmaniasis. Addition of interleukin-12 or interferon-gamma does not prevent CD8+ T regulatory activity. The dominance of type 1 CD4+ T cells in skin test positive adults maybe explained by their secretion of factors that inhibit and kill CD8+ T regulatory cells. Successfully treated patients rarely develop visceral leishmaniasis a second time. Their peripheral blood <b>mononuclear</b> cells show a mixed T1/T2 CD4+ and CD8+ T suppressor response but do have the ability to kill intracellular leishmania.|$|E
25|$|Amastigote form {{found in}} the <b>mononuclear</b> {{phagocyte}} and circulatory systems of humans. It is an intracellular and non-motile form, being devoid of external flagellum. The short flagellum {{is embedded in the}} anterior end without projecting out. It is oval in shape, and measures 3–6µm in length and 1–3µm in breadth. The kinetoplast and basal body lie towards the anterior end.|$|E
25|$|LGV is {{primarily}} an infection of lymphatics and lymph nodes. Chlamydia trachomatis is the bacterium responsible for LGV. It gains entrance through {{breaks in the}} skin, or it can cross the epithelial cell layer of mucous membranes. The organism travels {{from the site of}} inoculation down the lymphatic channels to multiply within <b>mononuclear</b> phagocytes of the lymph nodes it passes.|$|E
25|$|Epigenetic {{modifications}} such as DNA methylation {{have been}} implicated in cardiovascular disease, including atherosclerosis. In animal models of atherosclerosis, vascular tissue as well as blood cells such as <b>mononuclear</b> blood cells exhibit global hypomethylation with gene-specific areas of hypermethylation. DNA methylation polymorphisms {{may be used as}} an early biomarker of atherosclerosis since they are present before lesions are observed, which may provide an early tool for detection and risk prevention.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{mechanisms}} by which NO has been demonstrated to affect the biology of living cells. These include oxidation of iron-containing proteins such as ribonucleotide reductase and aconitase, activation of the soluble guanylate cyclase, ADP ribosylation of proteins, protein sulfhydryl group nitrosylation, and iron regulatory factor activation. NO has been demonstrated to activate NF-κB in peripheral blood <b>mononuclear</b> cells, an important transcription factor in iNOS gene expression in response to inflammation.|$|E
25|$|The spleen plays {{important}} roles in regard to red blood cells (also referred to as erythrocytes) and the immune system. It removes old red blood cells and holds a reserve of blood, which can be valuable in case of hemorrhagic shock, and also recycles iron. As {{a part of the}} <b>mononuclear</b> phagocyte system, it metabolizes hemoglobin removed from senescent red blood cells (erythrocytes). The globin portion of hemoglobin is degraded to its constitutive amino acids, and the heme portion is metabolized to bilirubin, which is removed in the liver.|$|E
25|$|The spleen synthesizes {{antibodies}} in {{its white}} pulp and removes antibody-coated bacteria and antibody-coated blood cells {{by way of}} blood and lymph node circulation. A study published in 2009 using mice found that the spleen contains, in its reserve, half of the body's monocytes within the red pulp. These monocytes, upon moving to injured tissue (such as the heart), turn into dendritic cells and macrophages while promoting tissue healing. The spleen is a center of activity of the <b>mononuclear</b> phagocyte system and can be considered analogous to a large lymph node, as its absence causes a predisposition to certain infections.|$|E
25|$|Papillomaviruses {{are usually}} {{considered}} as highly host- and tissue-tropic, and {{are thought to}} rarely be transmitted between species. Papillomaviruses replicate exclusively in the basal layer of the body surface tissues. All known papillomavirus types infect a particular body surface, typically the skin or mucosal epithelium of the genitals, anus, mouth, or airways. For example, human papillomavirus (HPV) type 1 tends to infect the soles of the feet, and HPV type 2 the palms of the hands, where they may cause warts. Additionally, there are descriptions {{of the presence of}} papillomavirus DNA in the blood and in the peripheral blood <b>mononuclear</b> cells.|$|E
25|$|Mesenchymal {{stem cells}} and cord blood CD34+ cells have been {{proposed}} to treat autism, but this proposal has not been tested. They may represent a future treatment. Since immune system deregulation has been implicated in autism, mesenchymal stem cells show the greatest promise as treatment for the disorder. Changes in the innate and adaptive immune system have been observed. Those with autism show an imbalance in CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells, {{as well as in}} NK cells. In addition, peripheral blood <b>mononuclear</b> cells (PBMCs) overproduce IL-1β. MSC mediated immune suppressive activity could restore this immune imbalance.|$|E
25|$|The spleen synthesizes {{antibodies}} in {{its white}} pulp and removes antibody-coated bacteria and antibody-coated blood cells {{by way of}} blood and lymph node circulation. A study published in 2009 using mice found that the red pulp of the spleen forms a reservoir that contains {{over half of the}} body's monocytes. These monocytes, upon moving to injured tissue (such as the heart after myocardial infarction), turn into dendritic cells and macrophages while promoting tissue healing. The spleen is a center of activity of the <b>mononuclear</b> phagocyte system and can be considered analogous to a large lymph node, as its absence causes a predisposition to certain infections.|$|E
25|$|Dysregulation of {{apoptosis}} (programmed cell death) {{is believed}} {{to play a role}} in the pathogenesis of a variety of autoimmune diseases, though its role in SS is controversial. Both the Fas and Fas ligand proteins are overexpressed in primary SS patients, while expression of BCL-1, which is known to downregulate apoptosis, was found to be significantly reduced in acinar and ductal epithelial cells of SS patients compared to healthy people. In situ studies did not show increased apoptosis among glandular epithelial cells, but did show reduced apoptosis among infiltrating <b>mononuclear</b> cells. Reduced apoptosis was also implicated in the accumulation of autoreactive B-cells found in the glands. The relationship of autoantibodies expressed in SS with apoptosis is still being researched.|$|E
25|$|This form is {{less common}} and affects puppies {{infected}} in the uterus or shortly after birth until about 8 weeks of age. The virus attacks {{the heart muscle}} and the puppy often dies suddenly or after {{a brief period of}} breathing difficulty due to pulmonary edema. On the microscopic level, there are many points of necrosis of the heart muscle that are associated with <b>mononuclear</b> cellular infiltration. The formation of excess fibrous tissue (fibrosis) is often evident in surviving dogs. Myofibers are the site of viral replication within cells. The disease {{may or may not be}} accompanied with the signs and symptoms of the intestinal form. However, this form is now rarely seen due to widespread vaccination of breeding dogs.|$|E
25|$|Once {{inside the}} human host, promastigotes invade macrophages. Inside the cells they {{transform}} {{back into the}} smaller amastigote form. The amastigotes replicate in the most hostile part of the macrophage cell, inside the phagolysosome, whose normal defensive response {{they are able to}} prevent. After repeated multiplication, they break down their host cell by sheer pressure of mass, but there is some recent speculation that they are able to leave the cell by triggering the exocytosis response of the macrophage. The daughter cells protozoans then migrate to fresh cells or through the bloodstream to find new hosts. In this way the infection is progressive, spreading to the host's <b>mononuclear</b> phagocyte system, particularly the spleen and liver. The free amastigotes in peripheral tissues are then ingested by sandfly to enter another cycle.|$|E
25|$|Leishmania donovani is {{a species}} of {{intracellular}} parasites belonging to the genus Leishmania, a group of haemoflagellate kinetoplastids that cause the disease leishmaniasis. It is a human blood parasite responsible for visceral leishmaniasis or kala-azar, the most severe form of leishmaniasis. It infects the <b>mononuclear</b> phagocyte system including spleen, liver and bone marrow. Infection is transmitted by species of sandfly belonging to the genus Phlebotomus in Old World and Lutzomyia in New World. Therefore, the parasite is prevalent throughout tropical and temperate regions including Africa (mostly in Sudan), China, India, Nepal, southern Europe, Russia and South America. It is responsible for thousands of deaths every year and has spread to 88 countries, with 350 million people at constant risk of infection and 0.5 million new cases in a year.|$|E
25|$|From Unigene's EST cDNA Tissue Abundance {{display and}} Protein Atlas, CXorf66 has a {{moderately}} high expression levels in testes, {{in addition to}} higher expression levels in fetus tissue in comparison to other developmental stages. CXorf66 protein also has a notable low presence in both the control endometrium total RNA and endometriosis total RNA. CXorf66 has been portrayed to have notable presence in the plasma and platelet. Based upon PaxDb data, CXorf66 has been found ranking in the top 5% for one study of human plasma and in the top 25% for another study conducted with human platelet. In addition to this, {{there has been a}} noticeable 60–100% CXorf66 protein presence in both non-failing and dilated cardiomyopathy septum tissue. Furthermore, CXorf66 has a ~75% protein presence in peripheral blood <b>mononuclear</b> cells.|$|E
25|$|The aging {{red blood}} cell {{undergoes}} changes in its plasma membrane, making it susceptible to selective recognition by macrophages and subsequent phagocytosis in the <b>mononuclear</b> phagocyte system (spleen, liver and lymph nodes), thus removing old and defective cells and continually purging the blood. This process is termed eryptosis, {{red blood cell}} programmed cell death. This process normally occurs {{at the same rate}} of production by erythropoiesis, balancing the total circulating red blood cell count. Eryptosis is increased {{in a wide variety of}} diseases including sepsis, haemolytic uremic syndrome, malaria, sickle cell anemia, beta-thalassemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, phosphate depletion, iron deficiency and Wilson's disease. Eryptosis can be elicited by osmotic shock, oxidative stress, energy depletion as well as a wide variety of endogenous mediators and xenobiotics. Excessive eryptosis is observed in red blood cells lacking the cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I or the AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK. Inhibitors of eryptosis include erythropoietin, nitric oxide, catecholamines and high concentrations of urea.|$|E
500|$|Tissue biopsy is {{not usually}} required, unless to rule out other {{suspected}} conditions such as oral squamous cell carcinoma. The histopathologic appearance is not pathognomonic (the microscopic appearance is not specific to the condition). Early lesions have a central zone of ulceration covered by a fibrinous membrane. In the connective tissue deep to the ulcer there is increased vascularity and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, histiocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The epithelium {{on the margins of}} the ulcer shows spongiosis and there are many <b>mononuclear</b> cells in the basal third. There are also lymphocytes and histiocytes in the connective tissue surrounding deeper blood vessels near to the ulcer, described histologically as [...] "perivascular cuffing".|$|E
2500|$|A {{portion of}} the {{nucleotides}} is additionally phosphorylated to the triphosphate forms. These [...] bind to GTP-binding protein Rac1, blocking synthesis of the protein Bcl-xL and thus sending activated Tcells and <b>mononuclear</b> cells into apoptosis (a kind of programmed cell death). Increased apoptosis of <b>mononuclear</b> cells is seen in inflammatory bowel disease patients treated with azathioprine.|$|E
2500|$|In their pre-domestication natural state, {{cats are}} solitary animals {{and do not}} share space (hunting areas, rest areas, {{defecation}} sites, etc.). Domestic cats living in a group therefore have a much higher epidemiological risk of mutation. After this mutation, the FCoV acquires a tropism for macrophages [...] (see also: immune cells, leucocyte, monocyte, dendritic cells, <b>mononuclear</b> cell, antigen-presenting cell) while losing intestinal tropism.|$|E
2500|$|The {{question}} of whether geriatrics (patients over 65) react the same as patients under 65 has not been sufficiently examined. [...] Coagulation issues and inflammation of atherosclerotic plaques are known to occur {{as a result of}} G-CSF injection. G-CSF has also been described to induce genetic changes in <b>mononuclear</b> cells of normal donors. There is evidence that myelodysplasia (MDS) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) can be induced by GCSF in susceptible individuals.|$|E
2500|$|Granulocytes are {{distinguished}} from agranulocytes by their nucleus shape (lobed versus round, that is, polymorphonuclear versus <b>mononuclear)</b> {{and by their}} cytoplasm granules (present or absent, or more precisely, visible on light microscopy or not thus visible). The other dichotomy is by lineage: Myeloid cells (neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils) are {{distinguished from}} lymphoid cells (lymphocytes) by hematopoietic lineage (cellular differentiation lineage). Lymphocytes can be further classified as T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells.|$|E

2500|$|The term {{thrombocyte}} (clot cell) [...] {{came into}} {{use in the}} early 1900s and is sometimes used as a synonym for platelet; but not generally in the scientific literature, except as a root word for other terms related to platelets (e.g. [...] thrombocytopenia meaning low platelets). Thrombocytes are cells found {{in the blood of}} non-mammalian vertebrates. They are the functional equivalents of platelets, but circulate as intact <b>mononuclear</b> cells, and are not simply cytoplasmic fragments of bone marrow megakaryocytes.|$|E

2500|$|Gaucher's {{disease or}} Gaucher disease (...) (GD) is a genetic {{disorder}} in which glucocerebroside (a sphingolipid, {{also known as}} glucosylceramide) accumulates in cells and certain organs. The disorder is characterized by bruising, fatigue, anemia, low blood platelet count and enlargement of the liver and spleen, and {{is caused by a}} hereditary deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (also known as glucosylceramidase), which acts on glucocerebroside. When the enzyme is defective, glucocerebroside accumulates, particularly in white blood cells and especially in macrophages (<b>mononuclear</b> leukocytes). Glucocerebroside can collect in the spleen, liver, kidneys, lungs, brain, and bone marrow.|$|E
2500|$|Platelets, {{also called}} thrombocytes ( [...] + , [...] "blood clot cell"), are a {{component}} of blood whose function (along with the coagulation factors) is to stop bleeding by clumping and clotting blood vessel injuries. Platelets have no cell nucleus: they are fragments of cytoplasm that are derived from the megakaryocytes of the bone marrow, and then enter the circulation.
