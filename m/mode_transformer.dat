5000|$|The UK Wireless World {{magazine}} of March 1970 published a detailed Capacitor-discharge Ignition system as an electronic hobby build project by R.M. Marston. The circuit {{of this system}} {{was similar to the}} Winterburn patent in that it used a push-pull converted switch mode oscillator for energy transfer to a store - discharge capacitor and conventional contact breakers to initiate a thyristor triggering discharge of the charged CD capacitor. It was stated to offer several advantages over conventional ignition. Among which: better combustion, easy starting even under subzero conditions, immunity to contactor (points) bounce and 2% - 5% fuel economy. Subsequent letters to Wireless World ( [...] March & May 1970), with Mr. Marston’s replies, further discussed aspects of the design and build. In July 1971 Mr. A.P. Harris, undergraduate of the City University London made a detailed electrical engineering analysis of the Marston design as well as automotive engine measurement trials to verify fuel economy. These confirmed the benefits of the CD ignition system. However, he found that the core ingredient of the CD design rested on careful hand winding of the switch <b>mode</b> <b>transformer</b> and appropriate selection of oscillator transistors and choice of oscillator frequency.|$|E

Ionization of the low number density aromatic molecules, that generally have lower ionization energies than naphthenic/paraffinic molecules, leads to the propagation of 2 nd mode streamers with velocities on the order of 1 km/s. As the applied voltage is increased, the ionization of the main hydrocarbon molecules in transformer oil, high number density naphthenic/paraffinic molecules, dominates producing high electric field levels and space charge at the streamer tip. This ultimately leads to the propagation of the 3 rd mode streamer with velocities on the order of 10 km/s. ABB Corporate Researc...|$|R

40|$|Department of Electrical EngineeringOptical {{interconnection}} {{is considered}} {{as an alternative}} solution to electrical interconnection since the former can overcome limits of the latter. Low power consumption and high-speed data transmission are expected from optical interconnection. Matrix switches are {{an important element of}} optical interconnection, and conventional on-chip matrix switches are based on silicon strip waveguides. Since such switches are controlled by using the plasma dispersion effect, there are a few disadvantages such as the loss concomitant with the effect and limited switching speed. The disadvantages may be removed if on-chip matrix switches are constructed from silicon slot waveguides with electro-optic polymer filling their slots. This is because the electro-optic effect has better tuning properties than the plasma dispersion effect. For matrix switches based on silicon slot waveguides, intersections of silicon slot waveguides must be developed. This research theoretically investigates compact efficient intersections of silicon slot waveguides. The proposed intersection consists of mode transformers between slot waveguides and multimode strip waveguides, which are connected to a crossing of the multimode waveguides. In the <b>mode</b> <b>transformer,</b> the rails of the slot waveguide are linearly tapered to be connected to the multimode strip waveguide, and the slot is terminated within the tapering region. The <b>mode</b> <b>transformer</b> converts the slot waveguide mode into even transverse-electric (TE) modes. Because of multimode interference among the even TE modes in the crossing, the intersection can work efficiently. How to design the intersection is explained. The throughput, crosstalk, and reflectance of the intersection are – 0. 078 dB, – 41 dB and – 36 dB, respectively, at a wavelength of 1. 55 μm. In the wavelength interval between 1. 5 μm and 1. 6 μm, the throughput is larger than – 0. 17 dB, the crosstalk is smaller than – 40 dB, and the reflectance is smaller than – 29 dB. The performance of the intersection is better than those of previous intersections of silicon slot waveguides. The footprint is 79. 2 μm 2, which is just less than 33 % of those of previous intersections. Finally, the fabrication tolerance of the intersection is discussed. It is demonstrated that the intersection is quite tolerable to fabrication errors. ope...|$|E

One of the recent new ideas within this field {{is based on the}} alternative formation of the subwavelength sized (quasi) periodic structures, manifesting as an effective medium with respect to propagating light.

Our contribution is devoted to a detailed numerical analysis and design considerations of Bragg filtering structures based on SWG idea. Based on our previous studies where we have shown impossibility of application of various 2 and 2 ̆ 01 c 2. 52 ̆ 01 d dimensional methods for the proper numerical analysis, here we effectively use two independent but similar in-house approaches based on 3 D Fourier modal methods, namely aperiodic rigorous coupled wave analysis (aRCWA) and bidirectional expansion and propagation method based on Fourier series (BEX) tools. As it was recently demonstrated, SWG Bragg filters are feasible. Based on this idea, we propose, simulate, and optimize spectral characteristics of such filters. In particular, we have investigated several possibilities of modifications of original SWG waveguides towards the Bragg filtering, including firstly - simple single-segment changes in position, thickness, and width, and secondly - several types of Si inclusions, in terms of perturbed width and thickness (and their combinations). The leading idea was to obtain required (e. g. sufficiently narrow) spectral characteristic while keeping the minimum size of Si features large enough.
