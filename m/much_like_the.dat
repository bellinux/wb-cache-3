5|$|Flagella are {{semi-rigid}} cylindrical {{structures that}} are rotated and function <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> propeller on a ship.

5|$|Although {{generally}} a peaceful bird, which lives quite happily alongside humans, the willie wagtail will defend its nest aggressively. Willie wagtails {{are known to}} swoop at passers by, <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Australian magpie.

Although different countries might have used units of measure with the same name, such as the foot, or local language equivalents such as pied, Fuß, and voet, there was no consistency in the magnitude of those units, nor in the relationships with their multiples and submultiples, <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> modern-day differences between the US and the UK pints and gallons.|$|E
5|$|Hot Jupiters, due {{to their}} extreme proximities to their host stars, {{have been shown to}} be losing their atmospheres into space due to stellar radiation, <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> tails of comets. These planets may have vast {{differences}} in temperature between their day and night sides that produce supersonic winds, although the day and night sides of HD 189733 b appear to have very similar temperatures, indicating that that planet's atmosphere effectively redistributes the star's energy around the planet.|$|E
