Uglow notes one critic's suggestion that Bewick may have <b>meant</b> <b>we</b> are looking at the scene through a playfully smudged window, as well as drawing our attention to Bewick, the maker. Adrian Searle, writing in The Guardian, describes the tiny work as [...] "A visual equivalent to the sorts of authorial gags Laurence Sterne played in Tristram Shandy, it is a marvellous, timeless, magical joke".|$|E
500|$|The Santa Fe National Forest's rocky {{terrain and}} steep {{inclines}} proved difficult for conventional camera equipment—such as cranes and dollies—which resulted {{in much of}} the film's scenes being shot by the camera operators, who were rigged to aerial ski lifts above the action. [...] "The location we picked was on top of the ski area above 12,000 feet in Santa Fe, and the high altitude made it extremely physically demanding", Schleissler explained. [...] "All our equipment had to be hand-carried into some of our remote locations, which <b>meant</b> <b>we</b> had to limit ourselves to the bare minimum...No one ever hiked to the set empty-handed, including our producers. It was one big team effort that made us a close film family." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{significance}} of the fixture for the two clubs was increased by the fact that, had Arsenal avoided defeat, they would have extended their unbeaten league run to 50 matches. Wenger told reporters at his press conference that he felt no increased pressure, though added the team's midweek draw in the UEFA Champions League at Panathinaikos increased expectation. He admitted his team's behaviour in the fixture last season was unacceptable, but pointed out [...] "...the best response we gave was to win the fair play table. That <b>meant</b> <b>we</b> took responsibility for what we did and we have improved our attitude." [...] Wenger believed United's strengths lay in creativity, {{and did not want}} to set his team out to nullify, rather to [...] "...play our game based on speed and technique." ...|$|E
500|$|By 12 o'clock when I came in {{it looked}} as if we'd lost control of the whole thing. My first {{decision}} was to send a Governor 5 back up to the remand prison {{to see if we could}} hold it, but it was too late. That decision, had it been taken half an hour earlier, would have <b>meant</b> <b>we</b> could have held the remand prison, meaning we could have kept another 400 locked up. Assuming the doors would have held, that sort of thing. But we had about 200 staff on duty, and we must have lost nine or ten casualties of one sort or another and then you lose staff getting the casualties out. We didn't have a lot of the staff come pouring in until about 1 o'clock. I tell you what really bugged us was there an element of April Fool about it. We rang staff up about it, who said [...] "You must be joking, is this an April Fool?" [...] That's what happened when they rang up my home, my son thought it was an April Fool.|$|E
500|$|By April 2013, filming was {{scheduled}} to begin in early 2014 at Shepperton Studios in England. At the Hollywood premiere of Iron Man 3, Whedon {{said that he had}} completed a draft of the script, started the storyboard process, and met with actors. Whedon also mentioned that he wrote with Downey in mind and included a [...] "brother/sister act" [...] from the comic books, later confirming that he was referring to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. Whedon explained his rationale for including the characters in the film saying, [...] "their powers are very visually interesting. One of the problems I had on the first one was everybody basically had punchy powers … 's got super speed. [...] can weave spells and a little telekinesis, get inside your head. There's good stuff that they can do that will help sort of keep it fresh," [...] though cautioned he was not throwing in more characters for the sake of doing that. Whedon stated that the twins allowed him to add more conflict: [...] "They don't like America, and they don't like the Avengers… The Avengers are like a world power, and not everybody's on board with the Avengers coming in and starting fights, even in the name of justice. So you need that dissenting voice, and you need to understand it and sympathize with it." [...] Because Marvel Studios shares the film rights to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch with 20th Century Fox and had to avoid conflict with Fox's X-Men films, Whedon introduced two important characters into the Marvel Cinematic Universe completely on his terms for the first time, which allowed him to connect their origin stories to the universe that they created and avoid the concept of mutants. Whedon relished at the storytelling opportunities by introducing a character with telepathic powers, explaining, [...] "it <b>meant</b> <b>we</b> could spend a little time inside the Avengers' heads—either their past or their impressions of what's going on, or their fears, or all of the above." [...] By May, Downey had entered negotiations to extend his contract with Marvel Studios and reprise his role as Iron Man in the film. A month later, Downey signed on to return for the then-untitled Avengers sequel, as well as a third Avengers film.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was decided}} that the series would {{conclude}} with the destruction of Liberator, the scenes for which were filmed on the series' final day of recording, Friday 7 March 1980. Special effects designer Jim Francis, who had the task of destroying the sets on camera, recalled; [...] "It was a big set to destroy. [...] All the pyrotechnics and the big beams dropping from the ceiling could only be done once, which <b>meant</b> <b>we</b> couldn't rehearse it. Everybody did what they were told, and it looked great".|$|E
2500|$|In a Stylist magazine, Duffy said of {{becoming}} poet laureate, [...] "There's no requirement. I do get {{asked to do}} things and so far I've been happy to do them."

I met her before I became poet laureate but when I was appointed I had an 'audience' with her which <b>meant</b> <b>we</b> were alone, at the palace, for the first time. We chatted about poetry. Her mother was friends with Ted Hughes whose poetry I admire a lot. We spoke about his influence on me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the failed}} effort {{to record a}} new studio album, the Police {{effectively}} disbanded. In the liner notes to the Police's box set Message in a Box, Summers explains: [...] "The attempt to record a new album was doomed from the outset. The night before {{we went into the}} studio Stewart broke his collarbone falling off a horse and that <b>meant</b> <b>we</b> lost our last chance of recovering some rapport just by jamming together. Anyway, it was clear Sting had no real intention of writing any new songs for the Police. It was an empty exercise." ...|$|E

2500|$|An early {{decision}} on Rouse's part was that The Suffering {{be more of}} an action game than a traditional survival horror. This had implications {{for much of the}} design work on the game, as [...] "it <b>meant</b> <b>we</b> were going to focus more on combat and avoid the long cutscenes, frail central characters, clumsy controls, fixed camera angles, and sparse ammo of many console horror games." [...] Another early decision was to keep the central character as much of a mystery as possible, implying only his strength and little else. Artist Mike Nichols says, [...] "We didn't really want a character that looked of any particular nationality or race. He really is almost Neanderthal in appearance. He's very primal. We wanted that strength to come through." ...|$|E
2500|$|The songwriting {{for a new}} album, Start {{from the}} Dark, began early in 2003. [...] "It {{was just a matter}} of moving forward and writing songs for the new album," [...] Tempest said, [...] "That was always our intention. We thought that if we were gonna make a comeback, we wanted to do it properly, and that <b>meant</b> <b>we</b> wanted to write and record some new songs, a new album." [...] For the {{recording}} of Start from the Dark, the band decided to work with producer Kevin Elson, who had also produced The Final Countdown. [...] "We could either go with a younger producer, or we could go with someone that we knew, someone experienced who is on the same wavelength as the band," [...] Tempest said, [...] "So in the end we decided that Kevin would be the perfect choice." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. On {{the way back to}} pit lane, Buemi declared to commentator Dario Franchitti his satisfaction with his success but admitted the victory was handed to him [...] "on a plate" [...] He later felt Rosenqvist was the deserving victor but was happy with the pace of his car: [...] "I think we were {{more or less the same}} pace [...] I’m very happy with that result, it just tastes a little bit different than normal." [...] Rosenqvist believed in the short-term he would look back at the whole race weekend positively for himself and Mahindra but was [...] "disappointed" [...] about his second-place result: [...] "Today, we were under pressure from Sébastien, we knew that we would be close as they looked very strong compared to yesterday. I knew that I had to drive a perfect race, every corner we had to drive perfect. I think we did a great job." [...] Third-place finisher di Grassi praised the track and the race weekend but acknowledged his team did not have the pace to stay with both Mahindra cars. However, he spoke of his enjoyment with his battle against Vergne and claimed his car was quicker in the second race: [...] "Yesterday we found some pace, which <b>meant</b> <b>we</b> could keep up a little bit with these guys, but we need to improve. There is still a couple of tenths we need to find to be able to fight [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Vergne was happy with his maiden victory, saying it felt [...] "extremely satisfying" [...] as he endured a difficult season and it would improve his team's confidence in the future, [...] "There were mistakes as a team but nevertheless, to get second places, double podiums and then a win today is an amazing feeling." [...] He stated the win would put Techeetah's personnel in a positive state of mind {{and that they would}} return for the following the season as a stronger force in the series. Rosenqvist revealed that Bird was his main rival over the race weekend and that his focus was to secure third place in the Drivers' Championship. Nevertheless, he was delighted to finish in the top three driver's standings in his maiden Formula E season, [...] "I think it speaks volumes about the kind of effort we have made as a team. Big, warm thanks to Mahindra Racing for putting their trust in me and for giving me the tools to achieve this.” Third-place finisher López spoke of his pleasure finishing in the position following his first race retirement, [...] "I could tell straightaway what a difference the team had made to the car since my last race and it was frustrating our qualifying group <b>meant</b> <b>we</b> were unable to show this. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the race and of course the whole season, as well as working with the DS Virgin Racing team.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Lucas's {{decision}} to cast [...] "unknowns" [...] was not taken favorably {{by his friend}} Francis Ford Coppola and the studio. Lucas needed an established actor to play the important Obi-Wan Kenobi character. Producer Gary Kurtz said, [...] "The Alec Guinness role required a certain stability and gravitas as a character... which <b>meant</b> <b>we</b> needed a very, very strong character actor to play that part." [...] Before Guinness was cast, Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune (who starred in Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress) was considered for the role. According to Mifune's daughter, Mika Kitagawa, her father turned down Lucas' offers for Kenobi and Darth Vader because [...] "he was concerned about how the film would look {{and that it would}} cheapen the image of samurai... At the time, sci-fi movies still looked quite cheap as the effects were not advanced and {{he had a lot of}} samurai pride." [...] Guinness was one of the few cast members who believed that the film would be successful; he negotiated a deal for 2% of the one-fifth gross royalties paid to George Lucas, which made him quite wealthy in later life. He agreed to take the part of Kenobi on the condition that he would not have to do any publicity to promote the film. Lucas credited him with inspiring the cast and crew to work harder, saying that Guinness contributed significantly to the completion of the filming. Harrison Ford said, [...] "It was, for me, fascinating to watch Alec Guinness. He was always prepared, always professional, always very kind to the other actors. He had a very clear head about how to serve the story." ...|$|E
