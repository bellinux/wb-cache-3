China <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> reprocessing in the 1980s; a pilot plant is under construction at Lanzhou, where a temporary spent fuel storage facility has been constructed. Geological disposal has been studied since 1985, and a permanent deep geological repository was required by law in 2003. Sites in Gansu Province near the Gobi desert in northwestern China are under investigation, with a final site expected to be selected by 2020, and actual disposal by about 2050.|$|E
5|$|The {{sandwich}} {{has a high}} {{sodium and}} fat content, and has been specifically targeted by UK café chains {{in an effort to}} reduce salt and fat. Due to this, low-fat mayonnaise is a common substitute along with low salt bread and less fatty bacon. In 2009, seven large cafe chains in the UK <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> reducing salt and fat through similar substitutions. A more visible solution is to use turkey bacon in lieu of normal bacon. One of the variations on the BLT is the club sandwich, a two-layered sandwich in which one layer is a BLT. The other layer can be almost any sort of sliced meat, normally chicken or turkey.|$|E

5|$|The Rasi Salai Dam was {{completed}} in 1994, {{around the same time}} as the Pak Mun Dam, and received similar local complaints. The dam's central reservoir was occupied for two years by villagers, until a July 2000 decision opened the sluice gates. From 2003 to 2004, Living River Siam coordinated Thai Baan research in three districts: Amphoe Rasi Salai, Amphoe Rattanaburi, and Amphoe Phon Sai. The report examined village culture, ecology, biodiversity, agriculture, and food and water management. The impact of the closing and opening of the sluice gates was also examined. It was concluded that the dam reduced fish populations, but more importantly, flooded natural salt pits and spread them into rice and vegetable fields, destroying trees and crops. The government has not <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> keep the Rasi Salai Dam out of commission, but as of 2008 the gates have not yet been closed.|$|E

25|$|The deal caused lively {{international}} reactions. One of {{the main}} reasons for the frenzy was {{due to the fact that}} West Germany, an NPT signatory, <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> transfer nuclear technology to Brazil, headed by a military dictatorship that was not party to the NPT. In the years that followed the announcement, Brazil and West Germany were under strong pressure coming from not just the U.S., but also the United Kingdom, Canada, France, and the Soviet Union—countries which supported a restrictive position on nuclear sales and strongly opposed the export of advanced nuclear technology such as fuel reprocessing plants.|$|E

25|$|Many of Poland's {{political}} elites were in hiding from the Russians following an unsuccessful uprising in 1830 to 1831. Hundreds of military officers, nobles, and aristocrats were hiding as refugees in Austria, but the Emperor of Austria was {{under pressure to}} surrender them to Russia for execution. He had previously <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> keep them safe from the Russians, but wanted to avoid war. The U.S. Congress and President Andrew Jackson agreed to take several hundred Polish refugees. They arrived on several small ships, the largest single arrival being 235 refugees, including August Antoni Jakubowski. Jakubowski later wrote his memoirs in English, documenting his time as a Polish exile in America. He recalled that the refugees originally {{wanted to go to}} France, but the government refused to receive them, and under obligation by the Austrian authorities, they came to America.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} of Uzbekistan has acknowledged {{the extent of}} the country's environmental problems, and it has <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> address them in its Biodiversity Action Plan. But the governmental structures to deal with these problems remain confused and ill-defined. Old agencies and organizations have been expanded to address these questions, and new ones have been created, resulting in a bureaucratic web of agencies with no generally understood commitment to attack environmental problems directly. Various nongovernmental and grassroots environmental organizations also have begun to form, some closely tied to the current government and others assuming an opposition stance. For example, environmental issues were prominent points in the original platform of Birlik, the first major opposition movement to emerge in Uzbekistan. By the mid-1990s, such issues had become a key concern of all opposition groups and a cause of growing concern among the population as a whole.|$|E
25|$|Northern philanthropists {{continued}} to support black {{education in the}} 20th century, even as tensions rose within the black community, exemplified by Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. Du Bois, as to the proper emphasis between industrial and classical academic education at the college level. An example of a major donor to Hampton Institute and Tuskegee was George Eastman, who also helped fund health programs at colleges and in communities. Collaborating with Washington {{in the early decades}} of the 20th century, philanthropist Julius Rosenwald provided matching funds for community efforts to build rural schools for black children. He insisted on white and black cooperation in the effort, wanting to ensure that white-controlled school boards <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> maintain the schools. By the 1930s local parents had helped raise funds (sometimes donating labor and land) to create over 5,000 rural schools in the South. Other philanthropists, such as Henry H. Rogers and Andrew Carnegie, each of whom had arisen from modest roots to become wealthy, used matching fund grants to stimulate local development of libraries and schools.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of 43Street, the former alignment of Highway4 in Lethbridge was along Mayor Magrath Drive, cosigned with Highway5 to 3Avenue in south Lethbridge, which was then Highway3. [...] It was later signed as 24Avenue past Highway5 (Mayor Magrath Drive), becoming Scenic Drive and continuing in a northwest direction to Highway3 near downtown. [...] In 1992, 43Street in south Lethbridge was widened from two to four lanes, although it did not carry the Highway4 designation at this time. [...] Ordinarily, Alberta begins to consider upgrading to a divided highway when traffic levels reach 10,000 vehicles per day. [...] The majority of Highway4 remains well below this threshold, but it is a component of the CANAMEX Corridor in southern Alberta, to which Alberta had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> upgrading in the late 1980s. Plans for a divided highway were confirmed by 1989, and reiterated as a priority by annual reports published by Alberta Transportation through the 1990s. [...] The highway was the southernmost component of what was then called the Export Highway, which also included Highways2 and 3, which were given priority for twinning {{in the first half of}} the 1990s.
