5000|$|The {{purchases}} of Henning Berg and Jaap Stam {{as well as}} the emergence of Wes Brown limited his chances further during the late 1990s and he saw very little action with the first team. However, {{towards the end of the}} treble-winning 1998-99 season, May enjoyed a brief comeback as Ferguson rotated his squad to cope with the <b>mounting</b> <b>fixture</b> congestion and United were challenging for the league title, FA Cup and European Cup. He was also named in the starting line-up for the 1999 FA Cup Final as Stam was being rested for the Champions League Final against Bayern Munich.

A popular chant with the crowd was [...] "David May, superstar! Got more medals than Shearer!"

40|$|The {{standard}} method for estimating the rigid-body motion of arbitrary interaction devices with an infrared-optical tracking system involves attaching pre-defined geometric constellations of retroreflective or light-emitting markers, {{commonly referred to}} as “targets”, to all tracked objects. Optical markers of the same type are typically indistinguishable from each other, requiring the tracking system to establish their identities through known spatial relationships. Consequently, the specific geometric arrangement of markers across multiple targets has a considerable impact on the system’s overall performance and robustness. In this paper, we propose a simple new methodology for constructing optically tracked rigid-body targets. Our practicallyoriented approach employs an optimization heuristic to compute near-optimal marker arrangements.

30|$|Equal {{number of}} {{comparator}} implants (size 3.5  mm[*]×[*] 8  mm) were {{inserted in the}} other tibia/femur head of the animals after doing the osteotomy according to the manufacturer’s protocol as follows. After mobilizing the mucoperiosteal flap, the 3 -mm center punch was used to register a guide for the twist drill. The twist drill was used to establish the axial alignment of the implant and {{to assist in the}} guidance of the depth drill. The depth drills were sequentially used to create osteotomy to the subcrestal axial depth of 0.5  mm. The conical reamer was used to develop the conical shape of the implant body and to check the osteotomy depth. A counter-clockwise rotation was used to compress the bone in soft bone. The tap or thread cutter was used for dense bone to create the threads in the osteotomy. The thread cutter’s diameter corresponds to the implant diameter. To engage the implant into the implant placement tool, the square faces on the implant <b>fixture</b> <b>mount</b> were aligned with those on the implant placement tool, then pushed together. Using the handle (finger wheel), the implant was pulled out of inner vial and the plastic collar was discarded. The implant placement assembly was transferred to the osteotomy and the implant was secured into the osteotomy site. The implant placement was started with the handle and finally placed using the hand-ratchet. If excessive force was experienced, the osteotomy was rinsed out and the depth was checked by retapping. To disengage <b>fixture</b> <b>mount</b> from implant, the open-ended spanner was used to break the retention force of the <b>fixture</b> <b>mount</b> retention screw. The knurled top of the implant placement tool was turned by hand to fully disengage the <b>fixture</b> <b>mount</b> with the implant. Pushing down on the knurled top of the implant placement tool disengaged the <b>fixture</b> <b>mount.</b>|$|R
