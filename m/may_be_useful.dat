5|$|Behavioral therapy <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> {{for chronic}} pain. There are several types available, {{including}} operant conditioning, which uses reinforcement to reduce undesirable behaviors and increase desirable behaviors; cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps people identify and correct negative thinking and behavior; and respondent conditioning, which can modify an individual's physiological response to pain. Medical providers may develop an integrated program of behavioral therapies. The evidence is inconclusive {{as to whether}} mindfulness-based stress reduction reduces chronic back pain intensity or associated disability, although it suggests that it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> in improving the acceptance of existing pain.|$|E

5|$|Clindamycin <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> in {{skin and}} soft tissue infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA); many strains of MRSA are still {{susceptible}} to clindamycin; however, in the United States spreading from the West Coast eastwards, MRSA {{is becoming increasingly}} resistant.|$|E
5|$|Many {{over-the-counter}} treatments in {{many forms}} are available, which are {{often referred to as}} cosmeceuticals. Certain types of makeup <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> to mask acne. In those with oily skin, a water-based product is often preferred.|$|E
5|$|The dermal punch: A dermal punch is used {{to remove}} a {{circular}} area of tissue, into which jewellery is placed, and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> for larger cartilage piercings. They are popular for use in ears, though not legal for use by nonmedical personnel {{in some parts of}} the United States.|$|E

5|$|A {{high blood}} {{prolactin}} level {{within the first}} 20 minutes following a seizure <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> to help confirm an epileptic seizure as opposed to psychogenic non-epileptic seizure. Serum prolactin level is less useful for detecting focal seizures. If it is normal an epileptic seizure is still possible and a serum prolactin does not separate epileptic seizures from syncope. It is not recommended as a routine part of the diagnosis of epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{is usually}} treated with daily {{medication}} once a second seizure has occurred, while {{in those at}} high risk, medication may be started after the first seizure. Supporting people's self management of their condition <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful.</b> In drug-resistant cases different management options may be looked at including a special diet, the implantation of a neurostimulator, or neurosurgery.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{occurs in}} a number of other animals {{including}} dogs and cats and is the most common brain disorder in dogs. It is typically treated with anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital or bromide in dogs and phenobarbital in cats. Imepitoin is also used in dogs. While generalized seizures in horses are fairly easy to diagnose, it may be more difficult in non-generalized seizures and EEGs <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful.</b>|$|E
50|$|Artificial {{sunlight}} <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> in prevention, or {{minimizing the}} severity of jet lag.|$|R
50|$|Agitated {{patients}} are best treated with benzodiazepines, but antipsychotics such as haloperidol and olanzapine <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>useful.</b> The alpha-2 agonist dexmedetomidine <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> {{for treatment of}} agitation, but effects on heart rate and blood pressure are variable based on several studies and case reports. Lidocaine and intravenous lipid emulsion have been successfully used for serious ventricular tachyarrhythmias in several case reports.|$|R

5|$|For adults, {{the testing}} of electrolyte, blood glucose and calcium levels is {{important}} to rule out problems with these as causes. An electrocardiogram can rule out problems with {{the rhythm of the}} heart. A lumbar puncture <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> to diagnose a central nervous system infection but is not routinely needed. In children additional tests may be required such as urine biochemistry and blood testing looking for metabolic disorders.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen {{is highly}} soluble in many rare earth and {{transition}} metals and is soluble in both nanocrystalline and amorphous metals. Hydrogen solubility in metals {{is influenced by}} local distortions or impurities in the crystal lattice. These properties <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> when hydrogen is purified by passage through hot palladium disks, but the gas's high solubility is a metallurgical problem, contributing to the embrittlement of many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.|$|E
5|$|If {{the pain}} is still not managed adequately, short term use of opioids such as {{morphine}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful.</b> These medications carry a risk of addiction, may have negative interactions with other drugs, and have {{a greater risk of}} side effects, including dizziness, nausea, and constipation. The effect of long term use is unknown. Specialist groups advise against general long-term use of opioids for chronic low back pain.|$|E

5|$|In {{cases where}} infections {{are related to}} intercourse, taking {{antibiotics}} afterwards <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful.</b> In post-menopausal women, topical vaginal estrogen {{has been found to}} reduce recurrence. As opposed to topical creams, the use of vaginal estrogen from pessaries has not been as useful as low dose antibiotics. Antibiotics following short term urinary catheterization decreases the subsequent risk of a bladder infection. A number of vaccines are in development as of 2011.|$|E
5|$|Other {{drugs such}} as {{amantadine}} and anticholinergics <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> as treatment of motor symptoms. However, the evidence supporting them lacks quality, so they are not first choice treatments. In addition to motor symptoms, PD {{is accompanied by a}} diverse range of symptoms. A number of drugs have been used to treat some of these problems. Examples are the use of quetiapine for psychosis, cholinesterase inhibitors for dementia, and modafinil for daytime sleepiness.|$|E
5|$|Several {{drugs that}} target {{molecular}} pathways in lung cancer are available, {{especially for the}} treatment of advanced disease. Erlotinib, gefitinib and afatinib inhibit tyrosine kinase at the epidermal growth factor receptor. Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> in the treatment of bone metastases.|$|E

5|$|TgPVR21 mice have {{incorporated}} the human PVR at chromosome 13. These mice are {{less susceptible to}} poliovirus infection through the intracerebral route, possibly because they express decreased levels of hPVR.

5|$|The {{development}} of autonomous robots capable of constructing intricate structures without human assistance has {{been inspired by}} the complex mounds that termites build.
