5|$|When World War I {{broke out}} in 1914, Khrushchev was exempt from {{conscription}} {{because he was a}} skilled <b>metal</b> <b>worker.</b> He was employed by a workshop that serviced ten mines, and he was involved in several strikes that demanded higher pay, better working conditions, and an end to the war. In 1914, he married Yefrosinia Pisareva, daughter of the elevator operator at the Rutchenkovo mine. In 1915, they had a daughter, Yulia, and in 1917, a son, Leonid.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev {{was born}} in 1894 {{in the village of}} Kalinovka, which is close to the present-day border between Russia and Ukraine. He was {{employed}} as a <b>metal</b> <b>worker</b> during his youth, and he was a political commissar during the Russian Civil War. With the help of Lazar Kaganovich, he worked his way up the Soviet hierarchy. He supported Joseph Stalin's purges, and approved thousands of arrests. In 1938, Stalin sent him to govern Ukraine, and he continued the purges there. During what was known in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War (Eastern Front of World War II), Khrushchev was again a commissar, serving as an intermediary between Stalin and his generals. Khrushchev was present at the bloody defense of Stalingrad, a fact he took great pride in throughout his life. After the war, he returned to Ukraine before being recalled to Moscow as one of Stalin's close advisers.|$|E

5000|$|The {{union was}} founded in 1836 as a split from the [...] "Dublin Tinsmiths and Sheet <b>Metal</b> <b>Workers</b> Society". It {{remained}} very small for many years, with only forty members in 1896. It affiliated to the National Amalgamated Society of Sheet <b>Metal</b> <b>Workers,</b> but when in 1920 that federation became the National Union of Sheet <b>Metal</b> <b>Workers</b> and Braziers, it became independent again, adopting the name National Union of Sheet <b>Metal</b> <b>Workers</b> and Gas Meter Makers. In 1967, it adopted its final name, and by 1970 it had 943 members.|$|R

25|$|The Rigvedic {{society was}} not {{distinguished}} by occupations. Many husbandmen and artisans practised {{a number of}} crafts.

Similar observations hold for carpenters, tanners, weavers and others.|$|E

In addition, certain occupational groups of <b>metal</b> <b>workers</b> were found, for the first time, to be at increased risk of death from other types of cancer; these included leukemia (PMR = 356) and cancer of the rectum (PMR = 248) in <b>metal</b> mill <b>workers,</b> Hodgkin's disease in welders (PMR = 242) and multiple myeloma in machinists (PMR = 209) ...|$|R

25|$|Around seven-thousand years ago, {{the first}} sign of copper {{jewellery}} was seen. In October 2012 the Museum of Ancient History in Lower Austria revealed that they had found a grave of a female jewellery worker – forcing archaeologists to take a fresh look at prehistoric gender roles after it appeared to be that of a female fine <b>metal</b> <b>worker</b> – a profession that was previously thought to have been carried out exclusively by men.|$|E

25|$|A major {{controversy}} over the August 4 agreement erupted the day after it was signed. An African American sheet <b>metal</b> <b>worker,</b> Gilbert Foster, began work, which led to rumors that white workers would strike in protest. Despite an emergency meeting by federal and city officials with leaders of Sheet Metal Workers Local 65, 14 white sheet metal workers walked off the job on August 6. The workers argued that Foster was not a union-accredited sheet <b>metal</b> <b>worker,</b> and that union rules required him to work for at least seven days to prove his skills. Paul Ristau, business agent for Local 65, agreed that Foster had not yet become a union member, but said his application was being processed. The UFM threatened to picket if Foster was not employed, so A. Nabakowski Co., the sheet metal contractor, offered to keep Foster {{on the job and}} pay him if he reported to work. The following day, Nabakowski paid Foster to sit in a trailer. Local 65 ordered its men back to work, and 11 of them did so (under protest) on August 7. Foster himself agreed to perform whatever non-work, makework, or sheet metal work the company wanted, which short-circuited the UFM's demand that he work solely on sheet metal projects.|$|E
25|$|The workers now {{decided to}} open up the factory to outsiders, {{including}} journalists. This made them more popular. At first, Jacques Chérêque, the national leader of the CFDT metallurgist section, was wary of the Action Committee. At request of the striking workers, he sent a representative, Fredo Coutet, a <b>metal</b> <b>worker,</b> to discuss the strike with the local section of the CFTC. After a week, Coutet was convinced by his experience, but Chérêque remained wary. At that time, the workers were still skeptical about trying self-management, and requested an employer. Led by François Chérêque, the CFDT now tried to find an employer to buy the firm.|$|E

500|$|On 26 March 1913, Lindemann {{traveled}} {{with his parents}} to Flensburg for his medical examination at the Naval Academy at Mürwik. The strong financial background of his parents made him a suitable applicant for the Imperial Navy, as {{the costs associated with}} a naval education in 1909 were 800–1,000 Marks per year for eight years. By comparison, a <b>metal</b> <b>worker</b> earned 1,366 Marks annually and a teacher 3,294 Marks. Only 5 percent of the German population at the time earned more than 3,000 Marks annually. However, the doctor certified him as fit only for limited duties (...) , as pneumonia in childhood had left him unfit for service in U-boats. After a second examination, he was accepted on probation, and Lindemann became one of the 290 young men of [...] "Crew 1913" [...] (the incoming class of 1913). He was officially enlisted in the Imperial Navy as a [...] (midshipman) on 1 April 1913.|$|E
