40|$|Organic acids {{are present}} in all plants, {{supporting}} numerous and varied facets of cellular metabolism. The type of organic acid found, and the levels to which they accumulate are extremely variable between species, developmental stages and tissue types. Acidity plays important roles in the organoleptic properties of plant tissues, where examples of both enhanced and reduced palatability can be ascribed {{to the presence of}} specific organic acids. In fruits, sourness is generally attributed to proton release from acids such as citric, malic, oxalic, quinic, succinic and tartaric, while the anion forms each contribute a distinct taste. Acidity imposes a strong influence on crop quality, and {{is an important factor in}} deciding the harvest date, particularly for fruits where acidity is important for further processing, as in wine grapes. In the grape, as for many other fruits, malate is one of the most prevalent acids, and is an important participant in numerous cellular functions. The accumulation of malate is thought to be due in large part to de novo synthesis in fruits such as the grape, through <b>metabolism</b> <b>of</b> <b>assimilates</b> translocated from leaf tissues, as well as photosynthetic activity within the fruit itself. During ripening, the processes through which malate is catabolised are of interest for advancing metabolic understanding, as well as for potential crop enhancement through agricultural or molecular practices. A body of literature describes research that has begun to unravel the regulatory mechanisms of enzymes involved in malate metabolism during fruit development, through exploration of protein and gene transcript levels. Datasets derived from a series of recent microarray experiments comparing transcript levels at several stages of grape berry development have been revisited, and are presented here with a focus on transcripts associated with malate metabolism. Developmental transcript patterns for enzymes potentially involved in grape malate metabolism have shown that some flux may occur through pathways that are less commonly regarded in ripening fruit, such as aerobic ethanol production. The data also suggest pyruvate as an important intermediate during malate catabolism in fruit. This review will combine an analysis of microarray data with information available on protein and enzyme activity patterns in grapes and other fruits, to explore pathways through which malate is conditionally metabolised, and how these may be controlled in response to developmental and climatic changes. Currently, an insufficient understanding of the complex pathways through which malate is degraded, and how these are regulated, prevents targeted genetic manipulation aimed at modifying fruit malate metabolism in response to environmental conditions.

40|$|The {{import-export}} {{transition in}} sugar beet leaves (Beta vulgaris) occurred at 40 to 50 % leaf expansion and {{was characterized by}} loss in assimilate import and increase in photosynthesis. The <b>metabolism</b> and partitioning <b>of</b> <b>assimilated</b> and translocated C were determined during leaf development and related to the translocation status of the leaf. The import stage was characterized by C derived from either 14 C-translocate or 14 C-photosynthate being incorporated into protein and structural carbohydrates. Marked changes in the C partitioning were temporally correlated with the import-export conversion. Exporting leaves did not hydrolyze accumulated sucrose and the C derived from CO 2 fixation was preferentially incorporated into sucrose. Both source and sink leaves contained similar levels of acid invertase and sucrose synthetase activities (sucrose hydrolysis) while sucrose phosphate synthetase (sucrose synthesis) was detected only in exporting leaves. The results are {{discussed in terms of}} intracellular compartmentation of sucrose and sucrose-metabolizing enzymes in source and sink leaves...|$|R
40|$|Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) {{was shown}} {{to be present in}} a range of {{developing}} seeds by measurement of its activity and by immunoblotting. Its function was investigated during grape (Vitis vinifera L.) seed development. The maximum abundance of PEPCK coincided with the deposition of storage reserves. At this stage of development, immunohistochemistry showed that PEPCK was very abundant in a layer of cells located at the boundary of developing storage tissues and in the chalaza (close to the termination of the vascular supply to the seed) and was also present in the palisade layer of the seed coat (the inner layer of the outer integument). Earlier in development PEPCK was also present in the developing palisade layer and in the inner region of the nucellus which surrounds the developing endosperm. At later stages of development, PEPCK was located in the outer region of the endosperm. However, PEPCK was present in the phloem of the seed at all stages of development. Feeding of asparagine to developing grape seeds led to a strong induction of PEPCK. We suggest that, in developing grape seeds, both the chalaza and palisade tissue may distribute imported assimilates from the vasculature to the developing storage tissues and that PEPCK {{may play a role in}} the <b>metabolism</b> <b>of</b> nitrogenous <b>assimilates</b> during their delivery from the vasculature to the storage tissues...|$|R

30|$|Another {{difficult}} parameter to {{be determined}} is the pipe coefficient. An exact estimation of this parameter is possible only if all the fine roots of the root system are measured, {{as in the case}} of the G dataset; otherwise, it can be estimated fitting the distribution of fine roots at different distances from the tree stem (as shown in Fig.  4). Not surprisingly, the results of this study show that the estimated pipe coefficient is considerably different for the two datasets. Considering that the pipe coefficient is an index of how many fine roots are actively contributing to <b>metabolism</b> <b>of</b> the plant (<b>assimilating</b> water and nutrients), it could be argued that increased concurrence and unfavourable local stand characteristics (i.e. soil type) would lead to a reduction in metabolism and thus to a reduction in fine-root number and growth. However, the value of the pipe coefficient results is actually higher for the PN dataset than the G dataset because the total number of fine roots is concentrated in a smaller area occupied by the root system, resulting in low total number of fine roots.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Genetics. Plant Biotechnology)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. The main aim of {{the work}} {{presented}} in this thesis was to further {{our understanding of the}} role of Pyrrophosphate: fructose 6 -phosphate 1 -phosphotransferase (PFP) in sugarcane, by specifically investigating its potential contribution to phloem metabolism. PFP activity in sugarcane internodal tissue is inversely correlated to sucrose content across varieties that differ in their sucrose accumulation abilities. This apparent correlation is in contrast to previous studies that suggest PFP plays an insignificant role in metabolism. In {{the first part of this}} study an immunological characterisation of the two subunits of sugarcane PFP was conducted to establish whether it differ significantly from other plant species in terms of size and distribution. Both the alpha and beta subunit appears to be approximately sixty kilo Daltons in size and uniform in their relative distribution to each other in the various plant organs of sugarcane. Although the observed alpha subunit size is less than that predicted this could be explained at the hand of post translational modification, in essence the sugarcane PFP subunits appear similar than that described for other plants especially that of tobacco which was employed as a model system later on in this study. The only direct way to investigate PFP’s contribution to phloem metabolism is to alter its activity by recombinant DNA technologies. Therefore, in the second part of the study transformation systems were designed for both the constitutive and phloem specific downand up-regulation of PFP activity. For the down-regulation of activity a post transcriptional gene silencing system, i. e. a complementary strand intron hairpin RNA (ihpRNA) silencing system, was employed. A partial sequence of the PFP-beta subunit was isolated and used in vector construction. For the over-expression the Giardia lamblia PFP gene was used. The model plant tobacco was employed to investigate PFP’s effect on phloem <b>metabolism</b> and transport <b>of</b> <b>assimilate.</b> Transgene insertion was accomplished by means of Agobacterium mediated transformation and tissue specific manipulation of PFP activity was confirmed by in situ activity staining...|$|R
