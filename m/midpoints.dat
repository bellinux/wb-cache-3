5|$|Any {{triangle}} or quadrilateral (even non-convex) {{can be used}} as a prototile to form a monohedral tessellation, {{often in}} more than one way. Copies of an arbitrary quadrilateral can form a tessellation with translational symmetry and 2-fold rotational symmetry with centres at the <b>midpoints</b> of all sides. For an asymmetric quadrilateral this tiling belongs to wallpaper group p2. As fundamental domain we have the quadrilateral. Equivalently, we can construct a parallelogram subtended by a minimal set of translation vectors, starting from a rotational centre. We can divide this by one diagonal, and take one half (a triangle) as fundamental domain. Such a triangle has the same area as the quadrilateral and can be constructed from it by cutting and pasting.|$|E
5|$|The Pondicherry shark has {{a robust}} build and a {{moderately}} long, pointed snout. The large and circular eyes {{are equipped with}} nictitating membranes. Each nostril is broad with a small, narrow nipple-shaped lobe on the anterior rim. The arched mouth lacks conspicuous furrows or enlarged pores at the corners. The upper and lower jaws contain 14–15 and 12–14 tooth rows on either side respectively; in addition, there are one or two rows of small teeth at {{the upper and lower}} symphyses (jaw <b>midpoints).</b> The upper teeth have a single narrow, smooth-edged central cusp, flanked on both sides by very large serrations. The lower teeth are narrower and more upright than the uppers, and may be smooth to finely serrated. The five pairs of gill slits are fairly long.|$|E
5|$|The angles made by {{each pair}} of arcs {{at the corners of}} a Reuleaux {{triangle}} are all equal to 120°. This is the sharpest possible angle at any vertex of any curve of constant width. Additionally, among the curves of constant width, the Reuleaux triangle is the one with both the largest and the smallest inscribed equilateral triangles. The largest equilateral triangle inscribed in a Reuleaux triangle is the one connecting its three corners, and the smallest one is the one connecting the three <b>midpoints</b> of its sides. The subset of the Reuleaux triangle consisting of points belonging to three or more diameters is the interior of the larger of these two triangles; it has a larger area than the set of three-diameter points of any other curve of constant width.|$|E
50|$|A <b>midpoint</b> is a {{mathematical}} point halfway between two stellar bodies that tells an interpretative picture for the individual. There {{are two types}} of midpoints: direct and indirect. A direct <b>midpoint</b> occurs when a stellar body makes an aspect to the <b>midpoint</b> of two other stellar bodies with an actual physical body at the halfway point.In other words, a direct <b>midpoint</b> means that there is actually a stellar body in the natal chart lying in the <b>midpoint</b> of two other stellar bodies. An indirect <b>midpoint</b> occurs when a stellar body makes an aspect to the <b>midpoint</b> of two other stellar bodies without a physical body at this <b>midpoint.</b>|$|R

40|$|For a {{function}} defined on a convex {{set in a}} Euclidean space, <b>midpoint</b> convexity is the property requiring {{that the value of}} the function at the <b>midpoint</b> of any line segment is not greater than the average of its values at the endpoints of the line segment. <b>Midpoint</b> convexity is a well-known characterization of ordinary convexity under very mild assumptions. For {{a function}} defined on the integer lattice, we consider the analogous notion of discrete <b>midpoint</b> convexity, a discrete version of <b>midpoint</b> convexity where the value of the function at the (possibly noninteger) <b>midpoint</b> is replaced by the average of the function values at the integer round-up and round-down of the <b>midpoint.</b> It is known that discrete <b>midpoint</b> convexity on all line segments with integer endpoints characterizes L^-convexity, and that it characterizes submodularity if we restrict the endpoints of the line segments to be at ℓ_∞-distance one. By considering discrete <b>midpoint</b> convexity for all pairs at ℓ_∞-distance equal to two or not smaller than two, we identify new classes of discrete convex functions, called local and global discrete <b>midpoint</b> convex functions, which are strictly between the classes of L^-convex and integrally convex functions, and are shown to be stable under scaling and addition. Furthermore, a proximity theorem, with the same small proximity bound as that for L^-convex functions, is established for discrete <b>midpoint</b> convex functions. Relevant examples of classes of local and global discrete <b>midpoint</b> convex functions are provided. Comment: Appendix B is adde...|$|R
5|$|The pigeye shark {{is a very}} robust-bodied {{species with}} a short, broad, and rounded snout. The small and {{circular}} eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes. The anterior rims of the nostrils bear medium-sized flaps of skin. The mouth forms a wide arch and has barely noticeable furrows at the corners. There are 11–13 (usually 12) upper and 10–12 (usually 11) lower tooth rows on each side; in addition, there are single rows of tiny teeth at {{the upper and lower}} symphyses (jaw <b>midpoints).</b> The teeth are broad and triangular with serrated edges; those in the lower jaw are slightly narrower, more upright, and more finely serrated than those in the upper. The five pairs of gill slits are of moderate length.|$|E
5|$|The viper dogfish has a slender, {{cylindrical}} {{body and a}} moderately flattened head with a very short and blunt snout. Behind the large oval eyes are narrow, elliptical spiracles. The nostrils are nearly vertical slits. The jaws are long and narrowly triangular, and can be protruded from the head. The teeth are distinctively fang-like and widely spaced; the most anterior teeth are grooved lengthwise. Six to 10 upper and seven to 10 lower tooth rows occur on each side, along with a single tooth row at {{the upper and lower}} symphyses (jaw <b>midpoints).</b> The teeth are largest at the symphysis and decline in size towards the corners of the mouth. When the mouth is closed, the upper symphysial tooth overlaps the lower, while the lateral teeth interlock. Five gill slits are seen, with the fifth pair longer than the others.|$|E
5|$|True to its name, the winghead shark's cephalofoil {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} long, narrow, and gently swept-back blades. The width of the cephalofoil is equal to 40–50% of the shark's total length. The front of the cephalofoil has a slight indentation in the middle and a gentle bump on each side in front of the nostrils. Each nostril is roughly twice as long as the width of the mouth and extends along almost the entire leading margin of each blade. The circular eyes, located at the forward outer corners of the cephalofoil, are equipped with protective nictitating membranes. The relatively small, arched mouth contains 15–16 upper and 14 lower tooth rows on each side, and sometimes also a single row of tiny teeth at the upper and/or lower symphyses (jaw <b>midpoints).</b> The teeth are small and smooth-edged, with angled triangular cusps. Five pairs of gill slits are seen, with the fifth pair over the pectoral fin origins.|$|E

40|$|An L-system or Lindenmayer system {{consists}} of a grammar and an interpreter. The grammar contains an axiom, usually a short string, that the grammar expands into a long, complex string. The interpreter then renders the string into an object. A <b>midpoint</b> L-system is a generalization of L-systems to two-dimensional arrays of characters inspired by <b>midpoint</b> displacement fractals. This study presents a system for simultaneously evolving the rules and and interpreter for a <b>midpoint</b> L-system that encodes a desired landscape. Unlike a <b>midpoint</b> displacement fractal a <b>midpoint</b> L-system is deterministic and can be evolved to yield fixed, complex shapes. The fractal character of a <b>midpoint</b> L-system permits the storage of a large complex virtual landscape in a small data object. The level of detail rendered by an L-system can be changed rapidly and, with a fast graphics engine, dynamically. This study introduces <b>midpoint</b> L-systems, gives techniques for evolving them, and demonstrates those techniques on trial landscapes that resemble hills and craters. The application of this work is for virtual reality where <b>midpoint</b> L-systems will allow a designer to select from many rugged versions of a landscape without requiring vast amounts of storage or machine time to render them.
