2500|$|Achievements Until {{the early}} 1980s, {{there was not}} a single <b>municipal</b> <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant</b> in China. In that year, the country’s first <b>municipal</b> <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant</b> was built in the city of Nanjing. Subsequently, China engaged in what is {{possibly}} the largest wastewater treatment investment program in history. It has been estimated that in 2006 there was sufficient capacity to treat 52% of municipal residential wastewater. According to the State Environmental Protection Agency the rate of urban wastewater treatment reached 57% in that year. The government's goal to achieve a level of 60% for treatment of municipal wastewater by 2010 was surpassed. [...] By 2010, 77.5% of domestic waste water was treated. Between 2001 and 2004, the number of cities that charge wastewater tariffs has increased from 300 to 475 out of 661 cities. According to the Notice on the Construction Plan for the Nation's Urban Waste Water Treatment and Recycling Facilities presented in the 12th Five-Year Plan by the General Office of the State Council, which was promulgated on May 4, 2012, the waste water treatment rate in the PRC will further improve by 2015. By the end of 2015, the waste water treatment rate should increase to 100% for municipalities, provincial capital cities and cities specifically designated in the state plan, 85% for other cities, 70% for counties, and 30% for towns.|$|E

Companies that produce membrane bioreactors have different ways of approaching to development. So there has been the emergence of several types of membrane systems, materials and procedures in the proper functioning of membrane bioreactors. We have presented the most commonly used systems, which are already well proven for usage for <b>municipal</b> <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants,</b> since they have been in operation for several years. By studying the literature it showed that the usage of membrane bioreactors for <b>municipal</b> <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> still has some drawbacks. Particularly the operating costs are higher than by conventional biological <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants,</b> which is result of membrane exchange. Since the membrane bioreactors are not commonly used at this type of <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> the costs of installing the system are therefore also higher. Some of setbacks of membrane bioreactors can be found in intense maintance and cleaning of the membranes...|$|R
40|$|By {{surveying}} 63 central <b>municipal</b> <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> throughout Thailand, it {{was found}} that about 80 percent of them did not function as expected (Pollution Control Department, 2004). Most of the problems were inadequate performance and operational problems. Concerning the Songkhla Lake Basin, there are 2 central <b>municipal</b> <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> serving only 7 percent of the basin population. These two plants were not designed for nutrient removal which is similar to most industrial <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> in southern Thailand. The untreated nutrients have caused eutrophication problems in Songkhla Lake. In addition, the existing activated sludge processes which treat industrial wastewaters are facing problems of bulking and rising sludge resulting in inadequate treatment. The major reason for the bulking sludge problem was most likely an insufficient oxygen concentration. Aeration control system is urgently required...|$|R

50|$|Water {{privatization}} in Albania {{was initiated}} by the Albanian government in the early 2000s {{with the support of}} the World Bank and German development cooperation. The stated objective was to improve the quality and efficiency of urban water supply and sanitation. At the time, many households received water only for a few hours every day, utilities were overstaffed, water tariffs were low and many customers did not pay their water bills. There was no single <b>municipal</b> <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant</b> in the country of 3 million, which is among Europe's poorest countries. In 2002-03 three contracts were signed with foreign private operators covering six secondary cities. Water privatization never covered more than a fifth of the country’s population.

50|$|For the {{enrichment}} of the anammox organisms a granular biomass or biofilm system {{seems to}} be especially suited in which the necessary sludge age of more than 20 days can be ensured. Possible reactors are sequencing batch reactors (SBR), moving bed reactors or gas-lift-loop reactors. The cost reduction compared to conventional nitrogen removal is considerable; the technique is still young but proven in several fullscale installations. The first full scale reactor intended {{for the application of}} anammox bacteria was built in the Netherlands in 2002. In other wastewater treatment plants, such as the one in Germany (Hattingen), anammox activity is coincidentally observed though were not built for that purpose. As of 2006, there are three full scale processes in The Netherlands: one in a <b>municipal</b> <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant</b> (in Rotterdam), and two on industrial effluent.

50|$|Adding to the problem, a <b>municipal</b> <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant</b> (WWTP) {{operated}} by SADM in Montemorelos, 45 {{miles southeast of}} Monterrey, is unable to make the capital investment required to expand unit operations and processes and therefore cannot meet the current needs of a growing community resulting in a heavily overloaded plant producing effluent that does not meet discharge standards of 30 mg/l BOD and Total suspended solids (TSS). In response, biological treatment technologies were deployed at the Montemorelos 1 WWTP without further significant capital increases. Positive results were observed after utilizing the biological treatment. Specifically, after 8 weeks of treatment, the Montemorelos 1 WWTP monthly average of influent BOD decreased 49% from 318 mg/l to 161 mg/l and influent TSS decreased 20% from 228 mg/l to 184 mg/l. Effluent BOD decreased 92% from 116 mg/l to 9 mg/l and effluent TSS decreased 80% from 58 mg/l to 12 mg/l.|$|E

The proposed Rabun County Water Reclamation Facility, located at a former Fruit of the Loom plant in the headwaters of the watershed, would upgrade the Fruit of the Loom building's existing treatment plant, which was formerly an industrial wastewater facility, allowing it to treat domestic and industrial wastewater and act as the county's <b>municipal</b> <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant.</b> The LTWA outlined its primary concerns in comments submitted by the Southern Environmental Law Center on their behalf to the Georgia EPD during the 30-day permit draft comment period, calling for a public hearing to address whether the permit should be granted and to ensure that it contains appropriate provisions to protect downstream users of the river.|$|E

The residents continue to use the pyramid to purify their wastewater, but all other functions it was planned to serve has ceased. Of the 120 homes it serves, only 30 are occupied by their owners, and the rest are rented. The organization of owners bills for wastewater treatment the same as the <b>municipal</b> <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant</b> would. In fact, the pyramid purifies water for less money than the WWTP. The regular maintenance for wastewater treatment is performed by a landscaping company who also looks after the green space within the block. Once a week, a staff member checks all of the gauges to make sure the system is working properly. Once a year, all of the pumps are maintained by a technical company. In the event of a problem, the landscaping company is alarmed and comes to fix it. In the case of damages to the system, such a broken pump or broken window, the organization of owners pays for replacement.|$|E
