5|$|Bluebells {{are widely}} planted as garden plants, either among trees or in {{herbaceous}} borders. They flower {{at the same}} time as hyacinths, Narcissus and some tulips. Their ability to reproduce vegetatively, using bulb offsets and seed, means that they can spread rapidly, and <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> controlled as weeds.|$|E
5|$|Elemental {{tellurium}} is {{not considered}} particularly toxic; two grams of sodium tellurate, if administered, can be lethal. People exposed to small amounts of airborne tellurium exude a foul and persistent garlic-like odour. Tellurium dioxide {{has been used to}} treat seborrhoeic dermatitis; other tellurium compounds were used as antimicrobial agents before the development of antibiotics. In the future, such compounds <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> substituted for antibiotics that have become ineffective due to bacterial resistance.|$|E
5|$|In hepatic {{encephalopathy}} type C, {{the identification and}} treatment of alternative or underlying causes {{is central to the}} initial management. Given the frequency of infection as the underlying cause, antibiotics are often administered empirically (without knowledge of the exact source and nature of the infection). Once an episode of encephalopathy has been effectively treated, a decision <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made on whether to prepare for a liver transplant.|$|E

5|$|Pregnancy is {{associated}} with greater-than-normal risks in women with SCI, among them increased risk of deep vein thrombosis, respiratory infection, and urinary tract infection. Considerations exist such as maintaining proper positioning in a wheelchair, prevention of pressure sores, and increased difficulty moving due to weight gain and changes in center of balance. Assistive devices <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> altered and medications changed.|$|E
5|$|A {{preventative}} procedure (thoracotomy or thoracoscopy with pleurodesis) may be recommended {{after an}} episode of pneumothorax, with the intention to prevent recurrence. Evidence on the most effective treatment is still conflicting in some areas, and there is variation between treatments available in Europe and the US. Not all episodes of pneumothorax require such interventions; the decision depends largely on estimation {{of the risk of}} recurrence. These procedures are often recommended after the occurrence of a second pneumothorax. Surgery <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considered if someone has experienced pneumothorax on both sides ("bilateral"), sequential episodes that involve both sides, or if an episode was associated with pregnancy.|$|E

5|$|Potassium {{levels can}} {{fluctuate}} severely during {{the treatment of}} DKA, because insulin decreases potassium levels in the blood by redistributing it into cells via increased sodium-potassium pump activity. A {{large part of the}} shifted extracellular potassium would have been lost in urine because of osmotic diuresis. Hypokalemia (low blood potassium concentration) often follows treatment. This increases the risk of dangerous irregularities in the heart rate. Therefore, continuous observation of the heart rate is recommended, as well as repeated measurement of the potassium levels and addition of potassium to the intravenous fluids once levels fall below 5.3mmol/l. If potassium levels fall below 3.3mmol/l, insulin administration <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> interrupted to allow correction of the hypokalemia.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{the results}} of a search for giant planets in the {{globular}} cluster 47 Tucanae were announced. The lack of any successful discoveries suggests that the abundance of elements (other than hydrogen or helium) necessary to build these planets <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at least 40% of the abundance in the Sun. Terrestrial planets are built from heavier elements such as silicon, iron and magnesium. The very low abundance of these elements in globular clusters means that the member stars have a far lower likelihood of hosting Earth-mass planets, when compared to stars in the neighborhood of the Sun. Hence the halo region of the Milky Way galaxy, including globular cluster members, are unlikely to host habitable terrestrial planets.|$|E
5|$|In {{adults and}} {{children}} {{over the age of}} 12, linezolid is usually given every 12 hours, whether orally or intravenously. In younger children and infants, it is given every eight hours. No dosage adjustments are required in the elderly, in people with mild-to-moderate liver failure, or in those with impaired kidney function. In people requiring hemodialysis, care should be taken to give linezolid after a session, because dialysis removes 30–40% of a dose from the body; no dosage adjustments are needed in people undergoing continuous hemofiltration, although more frequent administration may be warranted in some cases. According to one study, linezolid <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> given more frequently than normal in people with burns affecting more than 20% of body area, due to increased nonrenal clearance of the drug.|$|E

5|$|Stabilizing {{the person}} is the first priority. Those with a {{depressed}} level of consciousness <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> intubated and mechanically ventilated. Blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and Glasgow Coma Scale are monitored frequently. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, admission to an intensive care unit may be preferable, especially since 15 percent may have further bleeding soon after admission. Nutrition is an early priority, with by mouth or nasogastric tube feeding being preferable over parenteral routes. In general, pain control is restricted to less-sedating agents such as codeine, as sedation may impact on the mental status and thus interfere {{with the ability to}} monitor the level of consciousness. Deep vein thrombosis is prevented with compression stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression of the calves, or both. A bladder catheter is usually inserted to monitor fluid balance. Benzodiazepines may be administered to help relieve distress. Antiemetic drugs should be given to awake persons.|$|E
5|$|The Prussian War Ministry was interested, {{but some}} initial {{skepticism}} {{could only be}} overcome {{through a series of}} successful demonstrations. The pigeons proved relatively indifferent to explosions, but during battle a dovecote <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> moved, and pigeons can take some time to orient to their new position. The problem of making carrier pigeons accept a displaced dovecote with only a minimum of retraining had been tackled with some success by the Italian army around 1880; the French artillery captain Reynaud solved it by raising the pigeons in an itinerant dovecote. There is no indication that Neubronner was aware of this work, but he knew there must be a solution as he had heard of an itinerant fairground worker who was also a pigeon fancier with a dovecote in his trailer. At the 1909 exhibitions in Dresden and Frankfurt he presented a small carriage that combined a darkroom with a mobile dovecote in flashy colors. In months of laborious work he trained young pigeons to return to the dovecote even after it was displaced.|$|E
5|$|The larvae {{of clothes}} moths (mainly Tineola bisselliella and Tinea pellionella) feed on fabrics and carpets, {{particularly}} those that are stored or soiled. The adult females lay batches of eggs on natural fibres, including wool, silk and fur, as well as cotton and linen in blends. The developing larvae spin protective webbing and chew into the fabric, creating holes and specks of excrement. Damage is often concentrated in concealed locations, under collars and near seams of clothing, in folds and crevices in upholstery and round the edges of carpets as well as under furniture. Methods of control include using airtight containers for storage, periodic laundering of garments, trapping, freezing, heating {{and the use of}} chemicals; mothballs contain volatile insect repellents such as 1,4-Dichlorobenzene which deter adults, but to kill the larvae, permethrin, pyrethroids or other insecticides <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used.|$|E
5000|$|Vacuuming an infested object {{can remove}} pests. It <b>is</b> {{important}} <b>to</b> {{ensure that the}} “materials are not fragile or deteriorated" [...] if they <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> vacuumed. Vacuuming should remove all of the hatched pest, but some eggs may remain {{as they can be}} microscopic. After the object has been vacuumed, it should be placed in a plastic bag isolating the object. During the isolation, the objects should <b>be</b> monitored <b>to</b> make sure that no pests remain on the object, and after the pests life cycle is completed the cleaning process <b>may</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> repeated.|$|R
50|$|On routers {{that have}} this capability, the default TCP or UDP ports {{preconfigured}} to relay WOL requests are usually ports 7 (Echo Protocol) and/or 9 (Discard Protocol). However this proxy setting must be enabled in the router, and port forwarding rules <b>may</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> configured in its embedded firewall {{in order to}} accept magic packets coming from the Internet side to these restricted port numbers, and to allow rebroadcasting them on the local network (normally to the same ports and the same TCP or UDP protocol). Such routers may also <b>be</b> configurable <b>to</b> use different port numbers for this proxying service.|$|R
50|$|Some games require large spaces, special {{objects and}} tools, {{quietness}} or many before-game and after-game needs. When aged, frail or disabled people ("special needs") are involved, existing games <b>may</b> <b>need</b> modification <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used.|$|R
5|$|The mainstays of {{treatment}} are removal {{from the source}} of lead and, {{for people who have}} significantly high blood lead levels or who have symptoms of poisoning, chelation therapy. Treatment of iron, calcium, and zinc deficiencies, which are associated with increased lead absorption, is another part {{of treatment}} for lead poisoning. When lead-containing materials are present in the gastrointestinal tract (as evidenced by abdominal X-rays), whole bowel irrigation, cathartics, endoscopy, or even surgical removal may be used to eliminate it from the gut and prevent further exposure. Lead-containing bullets and shrapnel may also present a threat of further exposure and <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> surgically removed if they are in or near fluid-filled or synovial spaces. If lead encephalopathy is present, anticonvulsants may be given to control seizures, and treatments to control swelling of the brain include corticosteroids and mannitol. Treatment of organic lead poisoning involves removing the lead compound from the skin, preventing further exposure, treating seizures, and possibly chelation therapy for people with high blood lead concentrations.|$|E
5|$|While {{individuals}} with tics are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods of time, doing so {{often results in}} tension or mental exhaustion. People with Tourette's may seek a secluded spot to release their symptoms, or {{there may be a}} marked increase in tics after a period of suppression at school or at work. Some people with Tourette's may not be aware of the premonitory urge. Children may be less aware of the premonitory urge associated with tics than are adults, but their awareness tends to increase with maturity. They may have tics for several years before becoming aware of premonitory urges. Children may suppress tics while in the doctor's office, so they <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> observed while they are not aware they are being watched. The ability to suppress tics varies among individuals, and may be more developed in adults than children.|$|E
5|$|In 627, Honorius was consecrated as {{archbishop}} by Paulinus of York at Lincoln. Honorius {{wrote to}} Pope Honorius I asking the pope {{to raise the}} see of York to an archbishopric, so that when one archbishop in England died, the other {{would be able to}} consecrate the deceased bishop's successor. The pope agreed, and sent a pallium for Paulinus, but by this time, Paulinus had already been forced to flee from Northumbria. When Paulinus, after the death of King Edwin of Northumbria in October 633, fled Northumbria, he was received by Honorius and appointed to the bishopric of Rochester. The papal letter is dated to June 634, and implies that news of Edwin's death had not reached the pope. This evidence may mean that the traditional date of Edwin's death <b>may</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> moved to October 634. The papal letter may also mean that the traditional date of consecration for Honorius may need re-dating, as the long gap between 627, when he {{is said to have been}} consecrated, and 634, when he finally received a pallium, is much longer than usually found. It may be that Honorius was consecrated closer to 634. The papal letter to Honorius is given in the Ecclesiastical History of the medieval writer Bede.|$|E
