50|$|Having reached Elba, the Genoese captain takes {{advantage}} of a local wind pattern to change direction and head straight towards the Bizertines. However, the newly recruited free-rowers of the two additional ships lack the skill and strength for these arduous manoeuvres and begin drifting with the wind. Andrea Doria must send two of his older galleys to tow the less experienced ships. Two-thirds of the Genoese ships are unable to face-off and run down the adversary in a timely fashion. Rather than letting the opportunity pass, Andrea Doria puts his nephew Filippino Doria {{in charge of the}} four slower ships and takes his <b>main</b> <b>galleys,</b> the Capitana and the Patrona straight towards the Bizertine to pin them down before the main force arrives.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a method}} to reduce {{production}} costs, Ford eliminated one of the <b>main</b> oil <b>galleys</b> from the block casting, resulting in the 335 series having two galleys versus the Windsor family's three. The result was an oil system {{very similar to the}} 385 series V8 engines. The two <b>main</b> oil <b>galleys</b> in the 335 series engine run along the lifter bores. Oil is fed from the filter to the number one main bearing followed by the number one cam bearing above. At the same time, it also feeds the right hand oil galley, feeding the right side lifter bank. The lifter bank has four galleys that lead to each of the remaining main bearings. After the oil feeds the main bearings, it feeds each corresponding camshaft bearing above. At the rear-most main bearing, the oil goes into the other galley which feeds the left lifter bank. [...] This system has proven to be adequate for street engines, but can fall short in high-revolution race use without modification.|$|R

Additionally the <b>main</b> oil <b>galley</b> was moved from near the oil pan to near the camshaft. Also the valvetrain became non-adjustable and the previsions for a mechanical fuel pump were eliminated. Cast aluminum rocker covers were fitted in place of stamped steel covers.|$|R

50|$|Pisa {{realized}} the strategic {{importance of the}} castle of Livorno which owned since 1103 and in 1377 the Doge Gambacorti of the Republic of Pisa built a quadrangular Fort called Quadratura dei Pisani (Quartered of the Pisans) on plans attributed to Puccio di Landuccio and Francesco di Giovanni Giordani. In 1392 this fort was connected to a wall in order to defend better {{the town and the}} Darsena. Livorno, in 1405, was sold to Genoa which reinforced the defences building three forts under the Quartered, afterwards Livorno was bought from Florence on August 28, 1421 at the price of 100.000 Tuscan florin.The project to build Fortezza Vecchia was commissioned to Antonio da Sangallo the Elder in 1506, the fortress had to incorporate the existing Pisan and Genovese constructions.The works started in 1518 on order of the Cardinal Giulio De’ Medici under the supervision by Nicolao da Pietrasanta. The construction was suspended since the popular revolt sent the Medici in exile and was resumed in 1530 on their return. Fortezza Vecchia is a massive fortification completed on April 1, 1534 under Alessandro de' Medici; it was built in red-brick with sloping walls and the interposition of clear stones, has a quadrangular plant with a perimeter of 1500 meters and was equipped with 24 cannons to protect each side. One of the corners directs inside to join the Quartered of the Pisans and Matilda and Genoa keep; the three others are protected by triangular bastions with rounded tips. The bastion toward north is called Capitana because there moored the <b>main</b> <b>Galley,</b> to east is Ampolletta since housed the sand-glass used to control the guard duty, to west is the Canaviglia derived from Cavaniglia the name of the commander of the galleys of the Grand Ducky of Tuscany. The land on the side toward the town was excavated in order to have the fortress surrounded by the sea for a better defence.Cosimo I de' Medici built in 1544 an imposing palace, overlooking the Vecchia Darsena, above the Quartered of the Pisans which went destroyed during World war II.The successor Francesco I de' Medici built a small palace toward the sea, later became Porto Mediceo, on the top of Canaviglia bastion situated at the entrance of Vecchia Darsena. On the opposite side was built a church dedicated to Saint Francis where on March 19, 1606 Ferdinando I de' Medici elevated Livorno to the status of city.Fortezza Vecchia changed its function to the coming of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine in 1737, by a defensive structure to a military college for officers of the Army of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany (1769) and afterwards in garrison (1795).|$|E

50|$|Many book {{collectors}} place {{maximum value}} on the earliest bound copies of a book—promotional advance copies, bound galleys, uncorrected proofs, and advance reading copies sent by publishers to book reviewers and booksellers. It is true that these are rarer than the production copies; but given that these were not printed from a different setting of type (just the opposite; the <b>main</b> purpose of <b>galleys</b> and proofs is to double-check the typeset matter {{that will be used}} for production), they are not different editions.|$|R
5000|$|Nordhavn is a {{trade name}} {{of a line of}} ocean-going trawler-styled motor vessel {{designed}} and produced by Pacific Asian Enterprises, Inc. of Dana Point, California. The vessels, ranging from 40 to 120 ft in length, are renowned for their structural strength and ability to cross oceans. They all have a raised forward pilothouse which is separate from the <b>main</b> salon and <b>galley,</b> or an aft deckhouse with the pilothouse raised on a second level above the salon. They also generally have full headroom in the engine room, and a single main engine with a [...] "wing" [...] 'get home' engine with separate prop shaft and a folding propeller. Nordhavn vessels are often purchased by liveaboards and a proportion of owners live aboard their vessel; often selling their homes to purchase a Nordhavn. Some models optionally have twin engines.|$|R
5000|$|Little {{is known}} on {{particular}} Byzantine ships during the period. The {{accounts of the}} 1437 journey by sea of the Byzantine delegation to the Council of Florence, by the Byzantine cleric Sylvester Syropoulos and the Greek-Venetian captain Michael of Rhodes, mention {{that most of the}} ships were Venetian or Papal, but also record that Emperor John VIII travelled on an [...] "imperial ship". It is unclear whether that ship was Byzantine or had been hired, and its type is not mentioned. It is, however, recorded as having been faster than the Venetian great merchant galleys accompanying it, possibly indicating that it was a light war galley. Michael of Rhodes also wrote a treatise on shipbuilding, which provided construction instructions and illustrations of the <b>main</b> vessels, both <b>galleys</b> and sailing ships, used by Venice and the other maritime states of the region {{in the first half of}} the 15th century.|$|R
