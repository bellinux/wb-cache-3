But, the virtual information is selfilluminating, has an unclear depth, and, depending on the visual background, the signal-noise ratio and the brightness contrast varies. We examined performance in a visual search task in which a 0 had to be found under O. The head-worn display was placed in front of the monitor so that the stimuli overed the same parts of the visual field. Performance on the head-worn display was worse than on the monitor. Searching a <b>mixed</b> <b>display</b> (half of the stimuli occurred on the monitor, half on the head-worn display) took more time than expected by unitary performances.

40|$|Food {{retailers}} {{can present}} specific products {{in a separate}} category (e. g., separate section for organic products) or integrated into the mainstream shelf. This study investigates how assortment organization influences consumers' variety perceptions and product choice. We argue and show that when an assortment is organized according to an individual's goal (e. g., organics), {{he or she is}} more likely to choose a product that is in line with his/her goal (e. g., choose an organic product), compared to when products are presented in a <b>mixed</b> <b>display</b> or when categories are unrelated to this goal. Moreover, the results of three experiments show that when assortments are organized according to a relevant goal, people perceive more variety in the category with goal-consistent products (an in-category heterogeneity effect), but tend to see less variety in the category with products that are not consistent with their goal (an out-category homogeneity effect). This implies that food retailers can direct consumers' choice, as well as consumers' perception of the assortment, through assortment organization. Size of the category is shown to be a boundary condition. </p...|$|E
40|$|To tempt {{consumers}} towards {{more sustainable}} food choices, ‘intermediately’ sustainable products (i. e., in between conventional and organic) have been introduced. This poses the managerial question {{how to best}} position this range of products. In an experiment with intermediately sustainable meat products, we show that the choice share of these intermediate products is high when price level and physical display signal a consistent positioning of these products. This implies {{that the effect of}} layout depends on the price level at which intermediately sustainable products are offered. When these products are offered at intermediate prices, displaying them in a separate section will increase choice (i. e., unique feature positioning). Yet, when intermediately sustainable products are offered at low prices, a <b>mixed</b> <b>display</b> in which intermediately sustainable and conventional products are dispersed will be more effective in increasing choice for the intermediately sustainable options (i. e., comparative positioning). These results show the importance of assortment display in affecting the sales potential of products, and how the most optimal display in-store depends on price level...|$|E

We describe NOMOS from two perspectives. First, we present its software architecture, highlighting its principal difference from comparable systems: its use of an OWL-based semantic annotation back-end which provides automatic inference capabilities and a well-defined method for layering datasets. Second, we describe how the system is used. For corpus development and annotation we present a typical use scenario involving the creation of a schema and specialization of the user interface. For processing and analysis we describe the GUI- and Java-based methods available, including a GUI for query construction and execution, and an automatically generated schema-conforming Java API for processing of annotations. Additionally, we present some specific annotation and research tasks for which NOMOS has been specialized and used, including topic segmentation and decision-point annotation of meetings. 1...|$|E
40|$|Background: Antimicrobial {{peptides}} (AMPs) are {{an ancient}} group of defense molecules. AMPs are widely distributed in nature (being present in mammals, birds, amphibians, insects, plants, and microorganisms). They display bactericidal {{as well as}} immunomodulatory properties. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of a combination of two AMPs (temporin B and the royal jellein I) against Staphylococcus epidermidis. Results: The temporin B (TB-KK) and the royal jelleins I, II, III chemically modified at the C terminal (RJI-C, RJII-C, RJIII-C), were tested for their activity against 10 different Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, alone and in combination. Of the three royal jelleins, RJI-C showed the highest activity. Moreover, the combination of RJI-C and TB-KK (<b>MIX)</b> <b>displayed</b> synergistic activity. In vitro, the <b>MIX</b> <b>displayed</b> low hemolytic activity, no NO 2 - production and the ability to curb the synthesis of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma to the same extent as acetylsalicylic acid.

40|$|Patterns {{of sexual}} mixing and {{heterogeneity}} {{in the number}} of sexual partners can have a huge effect on the spread of a sexually transmitted disease (STD). The sexual mixing network identifies all partnerships within a population over a given period and is a powerful tool in the study of such infections. Previous models assumed all links within the network to be concurrent active partnerships. We present a novel modelling approach in which we adapt the notion of a sexual contact network to a monogamous population by allowing the nature of the links to change. We use the underlying network to represent potential Sexual partnerships, only some of which are active at any one time. Thus serial monogamy can be modelled while maintaining the patterns of <b>mixing</b> <b>displayed</b> by the population. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

Our results show that a classic search asymmetry does not exist for spatial frequency; that, rather, both types of targets ‘pop out’; that search for a high spatial frequency target amongst high spatial frequency distractors is less efficient than search for a low spatial frequency target amongst low spatial frequency distractors; and that observers are partially able to limit their search to the relevant subset in <b>mixed</b> <b>displays.</b> Implications for the design of touch screen user interfaces are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Diapycnal {{mixing of}} ocean waters {{is crucial to}} the {{dynamics}} and associated heat transport of the meridional overturning circulation, yet uncertainty exists regarding the distribution and physical mechanisms of this mixing. This study uses a highly-idealized, single-hemisphere model of buoyancy-forced flow to examine the examine the effects of the transience of diapycnal mixing on the MOC. The strength of the MOC was found to be insensitive to mixing transience when mixing occurred uniformly on basin boundaries. For mixing that was highly localized in space, a ten-fold increase in transience, as compared with the time-invariant control, resulted in a decrease by about 20 % of MOC mass and heat transport. The degree of sensitivity in the highly localized case {{is likely to be a}} strong function of the surface restoring timescale for temperature.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a new approach}} to developing and delivering user interfaces for Web applications. This approach, termed Scalable User Interfaces (SUI), is designed to allow a developer to create a single user interface definition for a Web application which can then be consumed, rendered and used by any device on the network. These devices can range from small displays such as mobile telephones to the full desktop-sized monitor displays used by personal computers. The goal of Scalable User Interfaces is to allow a single specification to be deployed on all devices without the need for the developer to specify any device-specific vocabularies, transformations, hinting or style sheets such as previous work in automated rendering for <b>mixed</b> <b>displays</b> and work in platform-independent user interface specification.

The main objectives are to image and characterize the glacier’s inner structure and to quantitatively monitor the seasonal thawing of near-surface frozen materials (snow/firn). A multiattribute approach is used to characterize the subsurface through different attribute categories, including instantaneous and textural attributes considering not only amplitude-, phase- and frequency-related attributes, but also other more complex and integrated parameters.

40|$|The axion photon {{system in}} an {{external}} magnetic field, when for example considered with {{the geometry of}} the experiments exploring axion photon <b>mixing,</b> <b>displays</b> a continuous axion-photon duality symmetry in the limit the axion mass is neglected. The conservation law that follows from this symmetry is obtained. The magnetic field interaction is seen to be equivalent to first order to the interaction of a complex charged field with an external electric potential, where this ficticious "electric potential" {{is proportional to the}} external magnetic field. This allows to solve for the scattering amplitudes using already known scalar QED results. It is argued that in more generic conditions (not just related to these experiments) axion-photon condensation could be obtained for high magnetic fields.

40|$|The {{development}} of a novel electromagnetically (EM) actuated stirring method, for use in microbioreactors, is reported. Mixing in microbioreactors is critical to ensure even distribution of nutrients to microorganisms and cells. Magnetically driven stirrer bars or peristaltic mixing are the most commonly utilised mixing methods employed in completely liquid-filled microbioreactors. However the circular reactor shape required for mixing with a stirrer bar and frequently used for peristaltically mixed microbioreactors presents difficulties for bubble-free priming in a microfluidic bioreactor. Moreover the circular shape and the hardware required for both types of mixing reduces the potential packing density of multiplexed reactors.
