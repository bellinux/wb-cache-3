40|$|The {{evaluation}} {{and implementation of}} microprocessor energy <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> in the Frito-Lay Energy Management Program is discussed. Following thorough testing of a mini-computer based system in one <b>manufacturing</b> facility, energy <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> were designated for eighteen of Frito-Lay's plants. The detailed evaluation of the mini-computer showed that the system was cost effective; however, the unit provided {{a great deal more}} capacity than was necessary. The overall studies showed that effective utilization of a microprocessor capable of controlling up to 20 points was sufficient for the majority of our older plants. The controllers were designed to monitor and shed nonprocessing related loads only and were projected to show reductions in energy consumption of 4 % - 5 % per plant. At this conservative estimate, the internal rate of return on the investment was in excess of 30 %. Data from one facility having a unit on-line for approximately one year shows actual savings to be greater than 23 %. Based on current successes with the units, an expansion of the existing capabilities is being investigated...|$|R

40|$|<b>Management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> is a {{traditional}} research area where the rules and practices of management are examined on how they direct employee behavior. Currently, changes in the market are seen to affect companies' internal needs to modify their <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> which different consultancy companies have recognized as well. The meaning of the <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> design and coordination should be studied more in organizations. This study examines the relationship between <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> design and coordination and how they affect <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> functioning in a manufacturing company. The theoretical part adapts Tessier and Otley's (2012) research {{of the meaning of}} the design in the employee perception of the <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> <b>Management</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> elements, the use of controls, and the role and objective of <b>management</b> <b>control</b> have been selected as factors affecting <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> design. The coordination process of <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> has been studied less and therefore Ghoshal and Nohria's (1989) theory of coordination mechanisms is used in this thesis. The focus is on the formalization of the <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> and its impact on internal transparency, global transparency, flexibility and repair. This study provides insights in the relationship between <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> design and coordination and brings forward success factors and main challenges in the <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> formalization. Practical constructivism was selected as an ontological approach to the study and it was conducted as a qualitative single case study. Semi-structured interview was selected as a data generation method. Research data consists of 12 interview for senior managers and other upper white collar employees in the organization. Analysis was conducted through content analysis which was directed by more abstract descriptive analysis strategy. The most remarkable findings concluded that the MCS elements design, the objective of control and the use of controls are inter-related subjects in the MCS design, and without common coordination different controls do not work together harmoniously as a package and do not support common goal achievement. Several external and internal prohibiting factors of formalization, such as history, uncertainty and the lack of control mechanisms, were identified and development suggestions were given for the case company.

Previous studies exploring the relationship between <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> and strategy have found the relationship to be interrelated and that <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> can take either an interactive or diagnostic role. However, these studies are limited in their approach as they do not address <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> as a package, thus failing to capture the importance of informal <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> and the impact separate controls have on each other. Applying a case study design using semi-structured interviews, the study partly supports the findings of earlier studies emphasizing how <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> can be classified and used for both interactive as well as diagnostic purposes. The study however, expands the view of earlier research by emphasizing how diagnostic controls should be further classified as either enforcing or reinforcing <b>control</b> <b>systems,</b> as well as emphasizing the importance of timing for understanding the different roles of <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> in a strategy formulation process...|$|R

Social capital provides a comprehensive framework for examining the nature of social connections through its focus on both structural networks (bridging) and interpersonal relationships that predispose individuals towards mutually beneficial collective action (bonding). In doing so, social capital provides a means of considering how individuals react to <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> in terms of the social ties that exist both within the organization and external to the organization. Using a case study of a non-government organization, we show how social capital is implicated in efforts to attract economic capital and cultural capital.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems,</b> 'strategy and organisational learning in organisational response to environmental change. The ability to change or learn on an organisation-wide basis when faced with environmental change is critical to organisational survival. The three concepts of strategy, <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> and organisational learning provide insights into {{the ways in which}} organisations adapt to their environment and to environmental change. Although <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> and strategy are both commonly defined in terms of fitting the organisation to its environment, as is organizational learning, there have been few previous studies that have concentrated on the relationships between all three concepts. This empirical research was undertaken in local government in Victoria, an industry undergoing severe environmental turbulence. A naturalistic and interpretivist approach was taken in this research. Data was collected using a questionnaire administered across the industry to gain a broad view of the characteristics of the <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> within the industry, and to classify those systems. Case studies were used to establish how members of each classific environmental change, and {{to examine the relationship between}} system characteristics and organisational learning. The results indicated that the strategy variable as defined in this and previous research did not allow sufficient differentiation to explain differences in the ways in which local governments responded to change. However, the differences in <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> characteristics were sufficient to obtain a three level classification of <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> in local government. The case study results indicate that differences in <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> design and use are associated with differences in the ways that organisations respond to environmental change. Some <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> assist the organisation to be proactive in seeking innovative new paradigms to effect organisational learning and organisational change in the face of environmental change. Other <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> allow organisations to continue to operate using obsolete paradigm, and diminish the organisation's ability to learn and to change in response to environmental change. Organisations with <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> exhibiting the characteristics of strong planning techniques, high use of environmental scanning, scheduled and ad hoc service and program reviews, strong cost control techniques, efficiency and effectiveness based performance evaluation, formal staff development programs, participative decision making, an interactive use of planning and review processes and liaison devices to integrate departmental activities can better respond to environmental change. They are more likely to undertake paradigmatic change when old paradigms become obsolete than are organisations lacking these characteristics. Organisations which limit the use of strategic planning and service review to a few senior managers, with power delegated to a few senior managers, and which have weak planning processes. There are policy implications arising from the results of this research for authorities wishing to effect change in organisations under their control. Change may not be achieved by legislation and regulation alone. As a first step, it may be necessary for governments wishing to achieve change to assist organisations to modify their <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> can affect the ways in which environmental changes are perceived, and the ways in which the organisations learn in response to these changes, so change in <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> may be necessary to allow organisations to recognise that they do need to change processes, little environmental scanning, weak cost control and efficiency rather than effectiveness performance reviews have a reduced ability to learn on an organization wide basis when faced with environmental change...|$|R

This thesis is about how the <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> have been affected by the re-regulation. Research Problem: When former monopolistic companies are exposed to free competition, the <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> are affected. Companies that never have thought about competition now have to prepare for competitors and focus on keeping their customers. How does the <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> changes when a monopoly market is exposed to competition? Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to describe and analyze how the re-regulation of the pharmacy market has affected the <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> in Apoteket AB. Methodology: Through a qualitative case study, this thesis is based on five interviews with employees at different positions in Apoteket AB. A deductive approach of the case study has been used in the making of this thesis. Conclusion: This thesis has led to the conclusions that the <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> in Apoteket AB have change within result controls, action controls and personnel/cultural controls. It can also be concluded that the prices are unchanged, the opening hours have increased, the number of pharmacies in Apoteket AB has decreased and the customer service in Apoteket AB has increased...|$|R
40|$|Background and Problem: There {{have been}} {{multiple}} studies encouraging further research of <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> as a package. These studies imply {{that there has}} been focus towards specific controls instead of how different controls affect each other and work as a package. Organizations might find that the controls work properly independent of each other, but if they not consider how the controls affect each other this could result in incorrect conclusions. It is especially hard to make <b>management</b> <b>control</b> work properly in large corporations where middle level managers face pressure {{from other parts of the}} corporation, which creates a complexity within their <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> This thesis investigates how a <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> could be structured and identifies the main problem areas for a middle level management team. Aim of study: The aim of this thesis was to expand the empirical knowledge about problems arising within a <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> We conducted our research at a middle level management team to investigate the additional complexity within their <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> which arise when being a part of an organization within a corporate group. Methodology: This thesis is based on a case study in an organization, Tuve Plant, within a corporate group, Volvo Group. The empirical data was collected mainly through a qualitative approach, where one observation and three semi-structured interviews from parts of the middle level management team were conducted. Analysis and conclusion: In this study four main problem areas were identified: the integration of the controls, the culture, the work with sorting out the right information and the amount of measures. There were also lack of knowledge and problems with the integration of the controls indicating that the <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> were not being viewed as a package. To create a functional <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> this study highlights the importance of working with cultural <b>control</b> and information <b>system.</b> Cultural <b>control</b> since it has great impact on employee’ behavior, affecting the acceptance of different changes, and information as it decreases the risk of misfits between the actual work and main targets affecting the whole <b>system.</b> If these <b>controls</b> are working properly we argue that the <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> package will be improved since these controls support other controls. An important acknowledgement is that a middle level management team does not have the authority to make all decisions; we find that these restrictions increase the complexity of working with improvements in the <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
