40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is {{generalization}} of all possible usage directions of <b>monitoring</b> <b>modes</b> of power consumption in production activity. The concept of creating a system of <b>monitoring</b> <b>modes</b> of power consumption in the industrial enterprises was proposed in this publication. The measures that reduce power losses {{and the amount of}} payment for these losses, as well as and procedures for ensuring accuracy, efficiency and reliability of measurement data, which are coming from the automated systems of electric power metering were considered. The importance of monitoring and control of current technological parameters of power consumption modes in the industrial enterprises was proved. Several new current technological parameters of the power consumption regimes were developed. It is concluded that in an industrial plant, it is necessary to create an integrated automated system for <b>monitoring</b> power consumption <b>modes</b> (and eventually all energy resources) for conducting a set of measures aimed to improve the energy efficiency of the enterprise as a whole. ????? ?????? ???????? ????????? ???? ????????? ??????????? ????????????? ?????? ??????????? ??????? ?????????????????? ? ???????????????? ????????????. ? ??????????? ?????????? ????????? ???????? ??????? ??????????? ??????? ?????????????????? ?? ???????????? ????????????. ??????????? ????, ??????????? ?????? ?????????????? ? ?????? ?????? ?? ???, ? ????? ?????????, ?????????????? ????????, ????????????? ? ????????????? ????????????? ??????????, ??????????? ?? ?????????????????? ?????? ????? ??????????????. ???????? ???????? ??????????? ? ???????? ??????? ??????????????? ?????????? ??????? ?????????????????? ?? ???????????? ????????????. ??????????? ????????? ????? ??????? ??????????????? ?????????? ??????? ??????????????????. ?????? ????? ? ???, ??? ?? ???????????? ??????????? ?????????? ??????? ????????? ?????????????????? ??????? ??????????? ??????? ??????????????????

40|$|We {{describe}} a wearable orthosis and an associated algorithm for the simultaneous assessment {{and treatment of}} essential tremor, {{one of the most}} common movement disorders in humans involving an overactivity of the olivo-cerebellar pathways. A motor providing effective viscosity is fixed on a wearable orthosis in the upper limbs. The motor is controlled by a personal computer with software processing in real time the position and rate of rotation of the joint detected by a chip gyroscope. The orthosis can be used in a <b>monitoring</b> <b>mode</b> and in an active mode. The range of tremor suppression of the signals above the orthosis operational limit ranges from about 3 % (percentile 5) to about 79 % (percentile 95) in relation to energy in the <b>monitoring</b> <b>mode.</b> Considering both postural and kinetic, the mean tremor energy decreased from 55. 49 +/- 22. 93 rad 2 s(- 3) in the <b>monitoring</b> <b>mode</b> to 15. 66 +/- 7. 29 rad 2 s(- 3) in the active mode. Medians of power reduction were below 60 % for the wrist and the elbow. In addition to supplying new information on the interactions between kinematics, dynamics and tremor genesis, this non-invasive technique is an alternative to current therapies.

50|$|The GC-EI-MS can be {{incorporated}} {{for the analysis of}} biological fluids for several applications. One example is the determination of thirteen synthetic pyrethroid insecticide molecules and their stereoisomers in whole blood. This investigation used a new rapid and sensitive electron ionization-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method in selective ion <b>monitoring</b> <b>mode</b> (SIM) with a single injection of the sample. All the pyrethroid residues were separated by using a GC-MS operated in electron ionization mode and quantified in selective ion <b>monitoring</b> <b>mode.</b> The detection of specific residues in blood is a difficult task due to their very low concentration since as soon as they enter the body most of the chemicals may get excreted. However, this method detected the residues of different pyrethroids down to the level 0.05-2 ng / ml. The detection of this insecticide in blood is very important since an ultra-small quantity in the body is enough to be harmful to human health, especially in children. This method is a very simple, rapid technique and therefore can be adopted without any matrix interferences. The selective ion <b>monitoring</b> <b>mode</b> provides detection sensitivity up to 0.05 ng/ml. Another application is in protein turnover studies using GC-EI-MS. This measures very low levels of d-phenylalanine which can indicate the enrichment of amino acid incorporated into tissue protein during studies of human protein synthesis. This method is very efficient since both free and protein-bound d-phenylalanine can be measured using the same mass spectrometer and only a small amount of protein is needed (about 1 mg).|$|R
