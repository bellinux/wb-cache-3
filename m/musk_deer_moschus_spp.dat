40|$|Understanding {{the status}} and spatial {{distribution}} of endangered species in biologically and ethnologically diverse areas is important to address correlates of cultural and biological diversity. We developed models for endangered <b>musk</b> <b>deer</b> (<b>Moschus</b> <b>spp.)</b> abundance indices in and around protected areas inhabited by different ethnic groups in northwest Yunnan China to address different anthropogenic and management-related questions. We found that prediction of relative abundance of musk deer was best accomplished using ethnicity of settlements, conservation status and poaching pressure in an area. Musk deer were around 5 times more abundant in Tibetan regions relative to Lisu regions. We found no significant negative correlates of gathering and transhumance activities on musk deer abundance. Hunting pressure showed {{no significant differences between}} protected and non-protected areas, but showed significant differences among ethnic groups. Hunting pressures in areas adjacent to Lisu settlements was 7. 1 times more than in areas adjacent to Tibetan settlements. Our findings indicate protected areas in southwest China are not fully effective in deterring human disturbance caused by traditional practices. We suggest that conservation and management strategies should engage traditional culture and practices with a positive conservation impact. Better understanding of indigenous culture may open up new opportunities for species conservation in much wider tracts of unprotected and human-dominated lands. Traditional practices that are not destructive to biodiversity should be allowed as a way of providing a link between the local communities and protected areas thereby creating incentives for conservation...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Alpine <b>musk</b> <b>deer</b> (<b>Moschus</b> sifanicus) {{have evolved}} {{behavioural}} characteristics which {{have contributed to}} their sur-vival and proliferation in a unique environmental niche.

Thirty two adult captive <b>musk</b> <b>deer,</b> 19 males and 13 females, were observed from August 2002 to January 2003, at Xinglongshan <b>Musk</b> <b>Deer</b> Farm (XMDF) Gansu Province, China. The frequencies of 12 behavioural categories were recorded and compared between the two sexes. The results showed (1) that behavioural patterns were similar between female and male deer, (2) that female alpine <b>musk</b> <b>deer</b> can express male specific behaviour, such as tail-pasting and, (3) that gender differences in feeding and ruminating behaviour {{may be related to}} energy requirement and resource allocation patterns...|$|R
