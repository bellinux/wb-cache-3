30|$|In {{the latter}} case, only the Raman {{analysis}} of the red sample A 14 enabled us to make an unequivocal identification of the pigment responsible for the colour. The Raman absorptions at 1620, 1560, 1499, 1447, 1397, 1334, 1258, 1221, 1187, 1131, 1080, 990, 845, 799, 726, 620, 459, 386 and 344  cm− 1 were, in fact, attributable to a PR 3 <b>monoazo</b> <b>pigment</b> [23],[24].|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of our investigations on a playing card preserved at The Mu¯zih-i A¯ ynih va Rushana¯ı¯ in Yazd, Iran. Conducting micro X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (m-XRF), micro-Raman spectroscopy (m-Raman), infrared reflectography (IRR), ultraviolet fluorescence photography, radiography, and optical microscopy, various paints applied on the playing card were identified. According to our analytical studies, red, green, blue, black, and gold-like metallic paints were identified to be a red <b>monoazo</b> <b>pigment</b> (b-naphthol PR 53 : 1), chrome green, artificial ultramarine blue, carbon black, and brass powder (Dutch metal powder), respectively, dating the playing card to 1895 onward based on the manufacturing date of the red <b>monoazo</b> <b>pigment.</b> Barite was also shown to be mixed with the pigments as an extender. On the other hand, the portrait’s face of the playing card was peculiarly blackened. Our analytical approach toward characterizing the blackened face showed that the black paint was achieved by carbon black and, in other words, the face was not blackened due to the darkening of Pb-bearing pigments. Moreover, it was shown that there was no underdrawing under the black face and the black paint was most probably executed in the same time with the other paints. Considering the possible use of the playing card, it was suggested not to remove the blackened face in the cleaning process since the black paint {{was a part of the}} integrity of the playing card...|$|E
30|$|HPLC–DAD and HPLC–ESI–MS {{analyses}} {{confirmed the}} identification of β-naphthol and mono-azo pigments, and provided a positive identification of two β-naphthols (PO 5 and PR 1) and two <b>monoazo</b> <b>pigments</b> (PY 1 and PY 3).|$|R
30|$|Comparison {{with the}} {{reference}} materials, UV–Vis spectra from the literature, high resolution mass spectra, and tandem mass spectra interpretation revealed {{the composition of}} the colour. The paint contained a mixture of two β-naphthols (PO 5 and PR 1) and two <b>monoazo</b> <b>pigments</b> (PY 1 and PY 3) characterized by orange, red and yellow hues, employed to paint the polyurethane foam of the flower petals. In particular, PO 5, PR 1 and PY 3 were detected in the HPLC–DAD chromatogram (see Fig.  7). PY 1 (molecular ion [M-H]− at m/z[*]=[*] 339.199) was detected by HPLC-ESI-Q-ToF only, due to its lower concentration with respect to the other pigments, thanks to the high selectivity and sensitivity of the mass spectrometric analyser. PR 1 (C.I. 12070) and PO 5 (C.I. 12075) are amongst the most significant β-naphthols, which were first put on the market in 1885 and 1909, respectively. PY 1 (C.I. 11680, patented in 1909) and PY 3 (C.I. 11710) belong to the very common class of Hansa Yellows.|$|R
30|$|Also the “S”-shape {{spectrum}} of the dark yellow had an intense absorption band in the UV–vis region. In this case, however, the first derivative spectrum showed an intense maximum at 534  nm with a weak shoulder at 486  nm. These spectral features were possibly due {{to the presence of}} a mixture of a lead chromate yellow with a <b>monoazo</b> PY 3 <b>pigment</b> [22],[25]. This hypothesis was confirmed by the Raman {{spectrum of}} sample L 14 in which the bands of lead chromate (355 and 840  cm− 1), of calcite (451 and 988  cm− 1) and of <b>monoazo</b> PY 3 <b>pigment</b> (412, 622, 649, 747, 1035, 1140, 1188, 1275, 1310, 1338, 1387, 1566, 1600, 1615 and 1670  cm− 1) were easily detectable.|$|R
30|$|The results {{obtained}} {{enabled us to}} affirm that Gallizio in this work used traditional organic pigments, such as ultramarine blue, lithopone, and carbon black, as well as modern organic ones, such as monoazo PY 3 yellow <b>pigment,</b> PR 3 <b>monoazo</b> red <b>pigment,</b> and phthalocyanine blue PB 15. Pigments were applied by the artist using a PVAc binder on the canvases of the ceiling, while siccative oils and PVAc {{were found on the}} canvas of the wall. Wires, sand and traces of gunpowder were also observed, thus confirming Gallizio’s use of unconventional artists’ materials.|$|R
30|$|In {{considering}} FT-IR {{spectra of}} samples L 17 and L 18, instead, we could identify only the absorption bands {{due to the}} binder and to the BaSO 4. Thus, no useful information on the coloured compounds was obtained. The proof that a blue-yellow mixture {{was used for the}} green areas was obtained from the Raman analyses. Raman spectra of green samples, in fact, showed both the absorptions of a phthalo blue PB 15 pigment at 1530, 1450, 1139, 1106, 745 and 680  cm- 1 5 and the peaks due to a <b>monoazo</b> PY 3 <b>pigment</b> at 1613, 1543, 1494, 1425, 1385, 1337, 1310, 1189, 795, 395 and 142  cm− 1 [23],[24].|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of synthetic {{dyes and pigments}} into commerce in the late 19 th century was a stimulating time for experimental scientists in their laboratory formulations and for artists in their usage. Nowadays, the period of pioneering syntheses and employment of synthetic organic colouring materials is highly intriguing for scientific research and for conservation purposes in heritage science. In this work, a combination of spectroscopic and chromatographic methods has permitted the elucidation of the chemical composition of 16 early synthetic organic pigment powders from the Lefranc experimental laboratory collection dating 1890 - 1914. It can be hypothesized that the most successful of these formulations could have been finalized in paint tubes and released onto the market, meaning that they may even be found in artworks from the same period. Specifically, information from this crucial period of transition from the exclusive use of natural dyes/colourants (such as neoflavonoids and plant and insect anthraquinones) to the {{introduction of}} their synthetic counterparts (such as synthetic alizarin and purpurin, and acid stable cochineal, together with <b>monoazo</b> and diazo <b>pigments)</b> is confirmed through Raman/surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection. By means of X-ray fluorescence and mid-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, a combination of traditional and modern inorganic substrates has been identified (alum, kaolin, barium sulfate and metallic salts), while Raman has provided additional data regarding the possible complexation of these pigments in the form of lakes...|$|R
