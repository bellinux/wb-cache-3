On lifting its curtain he was, however, dismayed to see a kirtle there, and imagining {{that he must have}} fallen upon the ladies' quarters, he was retreating with an apology; when the sharp voice of Dame Idonea called out, [...] "Oh yes, <b>Master</b> <b>Page!</b> 'tis you that are at home here.

60|$|As soon as {{grace was}} over, {{she called her}} maitre d'hotel, and bade him look after that galimafre, and see {{that none of these}} fools were {{unreasonably}} cheated, {{and that there was no}} attempt at gulling the young ones with charms or fortune-telling, as well as to conclude the matter so as to give no excuse for the Italian fellow lingering to sup and sleep. She then retired to her cabinet to prepare her dispatches, which were to include a letter to Lord Walwyn. Though a nominal friendship subsisted between Elisabeth and the French court, the Huguenot chiefs always maintained a correspondence with England, and there was little danger but that the Duke de Quinet would be able to get a letter, sooner or later, conveyed to any man of mark. In the course of her letter, Madame de Quinet found it necessary to refer to Eustacie. She rang her little silver handbell for the hall. There, of course, <b>Master</b> <b>Page</b> had been engulfed in the galimafre, and not only forming one of the swarm around the pedlar, but was actually aping courtly grimaces as he tried a delicate lace ruffle on the hand of a silly little smirking maiden, no older than himself! But this little episode was, like many others, overlooked by Madame de Quinet, as her eye fell upon the little figure of Rayonette standing on the table, with her mother and two or three ladies besides coaxing her to open her mouth, and show the swollen gums that had of late been troubling her, while the pedlar was evidently expending his blandishments upon her.|$|E

6000|$|As he {{was thus}} muttering, his eye fell upon {{the branch of}} a pear-tree which drooped down for want of support, and at once forgetting his haste, the old man stopped and set seriously about binding it up. Roland Graeme had both readiness, {{neatness}} of hand, and good nature in abundance; he immediately lent his aid, and in {{a minute or two}} the bough was supported, and tied up in a way perfectly satisfactory to the old man, who looked at it with great complaisance. [...] "They are bergamots," [...] he said, [...] "and if you will come ashore in autumn, you shall taste of them--the like are not in Lochleven Castle--the garden there is a poor pin-fold, and the gardener, Hugh Houkham, hath little skill of his craft--so come ashore, <b>Master</b> <b>Page,</b> in autumn, when you would eat pears. But what am I thinking of--ere that time come, they may have given thee sour pears for plums. Take an old man's advice, youth, one who hath seen many days, and sat in higher places than thou canst hope for--bend thy sword into a pruning-hook, and make a dibble of thy dagger--thy days shall be the longer, and thy health the better for it,--and come to aid me in my garden, and I will teach thee the real French fashion of imping, which the Southron call graffing. Do this, and do it without loss of time, for there is a whirlwind coming over the land, and only those shall escape who lie too much beneath the storm to have their boughs broken by it." ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Master</b> <b>pages</b> are {{templates}} used {{to automatically}} copy or link elements and graphic design styles to {{some or all}} {{the pages of a}} multipage document. Linked elements can be modified without having to change each instance of an element on pages that use the same element. <b>Master</b> <b>pages</b> {{can also be used to}} apply graphic design styles to automatic page numbering. Cascading Style Sheets can provide the same global formatting functions for web <b>pages</b> that <b>master</b> <b>pages</b> provide for virtual paper pages. Page layout is the process by which the elements are laid on the page orderly, aesthetically, and precisely. Main types of components to be laid out on a page include , linked images that can only be modified as an external source, and embedded images that may be modified with the layout application software. Some embedded images are rendered in the application software, while others can be placed from an external source image file. Text may be keyed into the layout, placed, or (with database publishing applications) linked to an external source of text which allows multiple editors to develop a document at the same time.Graphic design styles such as color, transparency, and filters, may also be applied to layout elements. Typography styles may be applied to text automatically with style sheets. Some layout programs include style sheets for images in addition to text. Graphic styles for images may be border shapes, colors, transparency, filters, and a parameter designating the way text flows around the object called [...] "wraparound" [...] or [...] "runaround.
