40|$|Construction C (also {{known as}} Forney's <b>multi-level</b> <b>code</b> formula) forms a Euclidean code for the {{additive}} white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel from L binary code components. If the component codes are linear, then the minimum distance {{is the same}} for all the points, although the kissing number may vary. In fact, while in the single level (L= 1) case it reduces to lattice Construction A, a multi-level Construction C is in general not a lattice. We show that the two-level (L= 2) case is special: a two-level Construction C satisfies Forney's definition for a geometrically uniform constellation. Specifically, every point sees the same configuration of neighbors, up to a reflection of the coordinates in which the lower level code is equal to 1. In contrast, for three levels and up (L≥ 3), we construct examples where the distance spectrum varies between the points, hence the constellation is not geometrically uniform.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{effective}} coding for the Rayleigh fading channel is addressed. A signal transmitted over the Rayleigh fading channel experiences quasi-periodic deep fades in the signal amplitude, and random phase shifts. The fades in signal amplitude are {{the cause of}} error events and limit the bit error rate of an uncoded system to about 10 - 4 {{at a signal-to-noise ratio}} of 30 dB. For applications where a lower error rate is desired, more sophisticated methods of transmission and detection are required. We present an extensive generalised analysis of the probability of error of maximum likelihood sequence estimation techniques for the Rayleigh fading channel This analysis provides the criteria for good code design for the Rayleigh fading channel and we extend the recently developed area of geometrically uniform (GU) codes for the AWGN channel, to the Rayleigh fading channel, and present the results of searches for good GU trellis codes. The concept of geometric uniformity is extended to set of points to form geometrically uniform partitions of signal sets. The GU partitions readily allow powerful <b>multi-level</b> <b>codes</b> to be defined with good distance properties. <b>Multi-level</b> <b>codes</b> have the advantage of outperforming trellis codes in terms of decoding complexity at the cost of greater decoding delay.

40|$|AbstractA two-hop relay {{fading channel}} is considered, where only decoders possess perfect channel state {{information}} (CSI). Various relaying protocols and broadcasting strategies are studied. The {{main focus of}} this work is on simple relay transmission scheduling schemes. For decode-and-forward (DF) relaying, the simple relay cannot buffer multiple packets, nor can it reschedule retransmissions. This gives rise to consideration of other relaying techniques, such as amplify-and-forward (AF), where a maximal broadcasting achievable rate is analytically derived. A quantize-and-forward (QF) relay, coupled with a single-level code at the source, uses codebooks matched to the received signal power and performs optimal quantization. This is simplied by a hybrid amplify-QF (AQF) relay, which performs scaling, and single codebook quantization on the input. It is shown that the latter is optimal by means of throughput on the relay-destination link, while maintaining a lower coding complexity than the QF setting. A further extension of the AQF allows the relay to perform successive renement, coupled with a matched <b>multi-level</b> <b>code.</b> Numerical results show that for high SNRs the broadcast approach over AF relay may achieve higher throughput gains than other relaying protocols that were numerically tractable.

Over the past decade, turbo codes have been widely considered to be the most powerful error control code of practical importance. In the same time-scale, mixed voice/data networks have advanced further and the concept of global wireless networks, integrating satellite and terrestrial links, has emerged. Such networks present the challenge of optimising error control codes for different channel types, and for the different qualities of service demanded by voice and data. This thesis begins with an investigation of the optimisation of binary turbo codes through good interleaver design. An analysis is made of what makes a good interleaver, and a novel interleaver design is proposed. The design is a hybrid between random and deterministic designs and will be shown to exhibit a very low error floor; comparable with the best interleavers investigated here. The design, however, has simpler implementation than the other interleavers.

40|$|The use of {{multiple}} antennas at the transmitter and the receiver can significantly increase the data rate and reliability of communications over wireless channels. With constraints in practical implementations, transmission techniques are designed to achieve a certain trade-off between transmission rates and implementation complexity. Layered space time (LST) architecture achieves high data transmission rates in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with reasonable complexity through separate multi-user detection and decoding. However, LST architecture is suboptimal since the redundancy in error correcting codes is not fully exploited in detection. This suggests improvements to the existing LST design are possible. <b>Multi-level</b> <b>coding</b> (MLC), which achieves the channel capacity {{based on the information}} chain rule, has been applied in MIMO communications for improved performance. In practice, however, rate optimization is difficult to implement. In this thesis, we consider improved LST architecture that provides better performance without increasing the implementation complexity. For improved performance, we propose the use of multi-stage decoding (MSD) in the LST receiver. The use of MSD exploits the inherent redundancy in error correcting codes in data detection and effectively applies the idea of <b>multi-level</b> <b>coding</b> (MLC). In addition, we propose unequal transmit power allocation to achieve equal capacities among layers. The introduction of transmit power as an additional dimension in design adds more flexibility to the design process and improves performance without increasing implementation complexity. Based on the notion of unequal power allocation, an improved LST architecture is proposed. The power allocation required to achieve equal capacities among layers in LST architecture is derived. The theoretical analysis of the proposed unequal power allocation is carried out for both fast and quasi-static fading channels based on different criteria. Performance analysis of the proposed approach is conducted and its practical implementation is discussed. It is shown that the proposed architecture is flexible in terms of implementation and offers a convenient trade-off between capacity and implementation complexity. The difference between achievable capacity in the proposed architecture and theoretical limits is negligible and converges to a constant at high SNR.

It is shown that the soft-decision MSD reduces the decoding complexity drastically and it is suboptimum. The hard-decision MSD further simplifies the decoding while still maintaining a reasonable coding gain over the uncoded system, if the component codes are chosen properly. Finally, some basic 3 -level 8 -PSK modulation codes using BCH codes as component codes are constructed and their coding gains are found for hard decision multistage decoding...|$|R
