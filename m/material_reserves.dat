Optimization of operational control of the territorial offices, factories, and settlements of custody within the framework of the state <b>material</b> <b>reserve</b> is one of the most effective instruments to enhance the functioning of the whole system. To solve the problem of technological processes optimization of products acquisition and storage in manufacturings, plants and points of consignment storage of the state <b>material</b> <b>reserve,</b> a static economic-mathematical model was developed.

The storage of emergency supplies need to be expanded due to material loss and the change of social-economic circumstances. In this study, a multi-objective planning model that formulates the time-variant storage for disaster recovery is developed. The model takes the minimum storage equipment investment, the minimum storage expenditure and material value loss, and the minimum shortage risk cost as multiple objectives in every stage of <b>material</b> <b>reserve</b> expansion. The weights of objective functions in the integrated model are solved based on the rough set theory.
