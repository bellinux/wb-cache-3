Unsupervised clustering methods were used to classify patients into 6 cluster groups (designated A to F) that varied significantly in rates of resistant disease (RD; P <. 001), complete response (CR; P =. 023), and disease-free survival (DFS; P =. 023). Cluster A (n = 24), dominated by NPM 1 mutations (78 %), normal karyotypes (75 %), and genes associated with signaling and apoptosis, had the best DFS (27 %) and overall survival (OS; 25 % at 5 years). Patients in clusters B (n = 22) and C (n = 31) had the worst OS (5 % and 6 %, respectively); cluster B was distinguished by {{the highest rate of}} RD (77 %) and multidrug resistant gene expression (ABCG 2, MDR 1).

Steroid hormone was used in acute leukemia and myleran in chronic for antileukemic chemotherapy. 1. Before treatment, the megakaryocyte count was less than normal level in acute leukemia and on the contrary, greater in chronic. The megakaryocyte function decreased both in acute and chronic leukmias. 2. After treatment, the megakaryocyte count was found markedly increased in chronic leukemia and frequently above normal level in acute leukemia. The megakaryocyte function also increased towards normal level both in acute and chronic leukemias and the increase was more remarkable in acute leukemia than chronic. 3. At relapse of acute lymphocytic and <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemias,</b> both the megakaryocyte count and function showed no remarkable changes. 4. On the relation to the growth pattern, in acute leukemia, both the megakaryocyte count and function showed the tendency of decrease when the growth pattern proceeded from the intermediate pattern to the normal. In chronic leukemia, megakaryocyte function increased moderately and the count decreased markedly when the pattern proceeded from the normal pattern to the hypoplastic. From the results obtained and on the consideration of the hemorrhagic diathesis, it is advisable that in acute leukemia, antileukemic treatment {{should be given to}} maintain the normal pattern in bone marrow tissue culture and in chronic leukemia, administration of antileukemic agents is to be quitted as soon as the hypolastic pattern is observed and after a careful observation is paid on the bone marrow tissue clture findings and clinical signs and symptoms, the administration should be started again when the culture returns to the normal pattern...|$|R

40|$|The c-myb {{oncogene}} {{has been}} a target of retroviral insertional mutagenesis in murine <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemias.</b> One mechanism by which c-myb can be activated is through the integration of a retroviral provirus into the central portion of the locus, causing premature termination of c-myb transcription and translation. We had previously shown that a leukemia-specific c-Myb protein, truncated {{at the site of}} proviral integration by 248 amino acids, had approximately a fourfold-increased half-life compared to the normal c-Myb protein, due to its ability to escape rapid degradation by the ubiquitin- 26 S proteasome pathway. Here we provide evidence for the existence of more than one instability determinant in the carboxy-terminal region of the wild-type protein, which appear to act independently of each other. The data were derived from examination of premature termination mutants and deletion mutants of the normal protein, as well as analysis of another carboxy-terminally truncated protein expressed in leukemia. Evidence is provided that one instability determinant is located in the terminal 87 amino acids of the protein and another is located {{in the vicinity of the}} internal region that has leucine zipper homology. In leukemias, different degrees of protein stability are attained following proviral integration depending upon how many determinants are removed. Interestingly, although PEST sequences (rich in proline, glutamine, serine, and threonine), often associated with degradation, are found in c-Myb, deletion of PEST-containing regions had no effect on protein turnover. This study provides further insight into how inappropriate expression of c-Myb may contribute to leukemogenesis. In addition, it will facilitate further studies aimed at characterizing the specific role of individual regions of the normal protein in targeting to the 26 S proteasome...|$|R

RT-PCR using MORF forward and CBP reverse primers amplified a MORF-CBP fusion in which nucleotide 3103 of MORF was fused in-frame with nucleotide 284 of CBP. Nested RT-PCR with CBP forward and MORF reverse primers generated a CBP-MORF transcript in which nucleotide 283 of CBP was fused in-frame with nucleotide 3104 of MORF. Genomic analyses revealed that the breaks were close to Alu elements in intron 16 of MORF and intron 2 of CBP and that duplications had occurred near the breakpoints. A database search using MORF cDNA enabled us to construct an exon-intron map of the MORF gene. The MORF-CBP protein retains the zinc fingers, two nuclear localization signals, the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain, a portion of the acidic domain of MORF and the CBP protein downstream of codon 29. Thus, the part of CBP encoding the RARA-binding domain, the CREB-binding domain, the three Cys/His-rich regions, the bromodomain, the HAT domain and the Glu-rich domains is present. In the reciprocal CBP-MORF, part of the acidic domain and the C-terminal Ser- and Met-rich regions of MORF are likely to be driven by the CBP promoter.

An agar plate method has been developed for quantitating lysozyme activity in small samples (approximately 25 µl) of serum, urine, or other biological fluids.

40|$|This thesis {{aimed to}} define the role of {{reactive}} oxygen species (ROS), produced by the NADPH oxidase of myeloid cells, in the regulation of lymphocyte function with focus on ROS-induced dysfunction of natural killer (NK) cells and T lymphocytes in myeloid leukemia. In Paper I, a novel mechanism is presented by which specifically activated T lymphocytes evade inactivation by ROS after antigen presentation. Antigen-presenting dendritic cells were found to induce ROS-neutralizing thiols {{on the surface of}} antigen-specific T cells, but not on T cells that lacked antigen specificity. These findings may explain why antigen-specific T cells remain viable under conditions of oxidative stress. Paper II shows that subsets of leukemic cells recovered from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) produce and release ROS via a membrane-bound NADPH oxidase, and that ROS-producing leukemic cells initiate a PARP- 1 -dependent pathway of cell death (parthanatos) in NK cells and T cells. The results presented in Paper III demonstrate that treatment of AML patients with a NADPH oxidase inhibitor (histamine dihydrochloride) was preferentially efficacious among patients with <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemias</b> (FAB classes M 4 and M 5), in which cells of the leukemic clone expressed a ROS-producing NADPH oxidase and functional histamine H 2 receptors. The results presented in Paper IV imply that malignant cells recovered from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia utilize the ROS/PARP- 1 axis to induce NK cell parthanatos and that PARP- 1 inhibition maintains functions of T cells and NK cells under conditions of oxidative stress. Paper V aimed {{to define the}} intracellular pathways of ROS-induced PARP- 1 activation with ensuing cell death in lymphocytes.

Prior to perform the estimation on the autopsy materials the changes in the activity of the enzyme after the death have been checked on rats with {{a certain period of time}} after killing the animals. The tests proved that no change occurs in the activity in those preserved at 1 to 2 C in a ice chamber 24 hours after the death, though a marked decrease can be seen after 17 hours at 37 C. On the basis of this observation all the autopsy materials are taken within 8 hours after the death. As the results it has been found that the liver catalase decreases markedly in its activity in some disease as revealed by estimating with the slightly modified method of Bonichsen, Chance and Theorell. The liver tissues from 5 cases bearing malignant neoplasms and having tumors in the liver show a markedly low activity in catalase, 65. 7 % of the normal level in mean value, and the tumor tissues themselves in the liver are found to be extremely low in activity, 27. 5 %. A relatively low activity also can be seen in the liver from another tumor-bearing individuals, in which no metastasized tumor in the liver has been found, 82 % of the normal level.
