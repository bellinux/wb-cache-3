We determined the extinction coefficients at both high photon energy (3. 1 eV) and at the first excitonic transition band for CIS-QDs, {{ranging in size from}} 2. 5 nm to 5. 1 nm. Both coefficient trends displayed a power-law size dependence for the QDs. These data allow the in situ assessment of the CIS-QD concentration via routine optical absorption measurements, which is an important parameter for many applications.
