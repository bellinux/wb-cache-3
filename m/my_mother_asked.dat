6000|$|December 1841.--Wordsworth and Miss Fenwick {{spent the}} {{shortest}} {{day of the}} year with us; he brought with him his Epitaph on Southey, and as we sat round the fire after dinner, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>asked</b> him to read it to us, which he did in his usual impressive manner. He asked our impression of it. My mother ventured to tell him of one word, or rather two, which she thought might be altered with advantage. They were these: ...|$|E

He told her that they were protecting the wheat to prevent us from eating it, to which she answered angrily that hares must live somehow, especially when they had young ones to nurse. My father replied that men did not seem to think so, and perhaps they had young ones also. I see now that my father was a philosophic hare. But are you tired of my story? ...|$|E

60|$|We {{went home}} {{early in the}} evening. It was a very fine evening, {{and my mother and}} he had another stroll by the sweetbriar, while I was sent in to get my tea.

I took the opportunity of asking if she was at all acquainted with Mr. Brooks of Sheffield, but she answered No, only she supposed he must be a manufacturer in the knife and fork way.|$|E
60|$|In {{the first}} place, every one knew I was bitter poor; and I think, perhaps, {{it was my}} good mother's fault that I was bitter proud too.

If it was boys, and they ventured to sneer, I would beat them, or die for it; and many's the time I've been brought home well-nigh killed by one or more of them, on what, when <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>asked</b> me, I would say was 'a family quarrel.'

[...] "I know that there was some quarrel between our fathers, but when we heard of Sir Aubrey's death, both my father and mother thought that you would come to see us or would have written--for indeed it was not until after my father's death that we paid a visit to London.

In the morning she was pleased to send all 'the children' out on the beach, then free from the railway. It was a beautiful day, with the intensely blue South Devon sea dancing in golden ripples, and breaking on the shore with the sound Clarence loved so well, as, {{in the shade of}} the dark crimson cliffs, Emily sat at my feet and my brothers unfolded their strange discoveries into her lap. There was a kind of solemnity in the thing; we scarcely spoke, except that Emily said, 'Oh, will she come again,' and, as the tears gathered at sight of the pathetic petition in the old book, 'Was that granted?' ...|$|R

The similar things happened for my parents-in-law, they always mention the clothes, food, cooking devices, nearly all the things that I bought for them to their friends and relatives to show that they have a xiao daughter-in-law which would gain face for them. So I get a feeling that filial piety was not only a thing for me, but also an important aspect of the elders’ mianzi and their social life. I am happy {{to do the things that}} would maintain or enhance their mianzi. Personally, I think it may also help with keeping a good relationship with elders. (Teacher high school, 26) [...]...|$|R

Not long after I arrived at my host family 2 ̆ 7 s home, <b>my</b> host <b>mother</b> <b>asked</b> me whether or not I was 2 ̆ 2 evangelica 2 ̆ 2. I was somewhat confused by this question because it went against my previous assumption that the majority of Latin Americans-or at least Latin American Christians were Catholic. Knowing a minimal amount of Spanish and very little about the culture, I answered yes, essentially translating 2 ̆ 2 evangelica 2 ̆ 2 as 2 ̆ 2 Protestant 2 ̆ 2. I would soon learn, however, that the term 2 ̆ 2 evangelica 2 ̆ 2 had much deeper meaning and held quite different connotations to <b>my</b> host <b>mother</b> and to many other Latin Americans than my definition of Protestant did to me...|$|R

40|$|A {{few weeks}} ago <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> learned at her Greenwich, Conn., church that, beyond church grounds, Bibles cannot be {{purchased}} in the People’s Republic. Her informant was {{a man from the}} Bible Society of Singapore who gave an evening talk on the state of Christianity in China at my parents’ mainstream Protestant parish. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> soon <b>asked</b> her son in Beijing, me, about this fact over the phone and I couldn’t say either way: a Chinese-language Bible was not something I’d been actively looking for yet I could have sworn I’d spotted one in a shop a while back when living in China’s Northwest. Then again, that was a long decade ago. I am clearly no expert on the subject. Then on a recent morning in a basement bookstore in the National Library in Beijing a volume with a black binding and gold lettering caught my eye. I pulled it off the shelf. In no shape to identify the Chinese word for “Genesis” or for “Psalms”, I checked the volume’s opening passage: “Shen shuo: ‘Yao you guang’, jiu you le guang,” it read. God said: “Let there be light,” and there was light. I was holding a Bible. I took the book to the counter – its look was so plainly familiar it could have had the stamp of the Gideons on its cover– and {{without so much as a}} glance at my selection the cashier, while barking into a phone, rang it up. At fifty percent off, I thought, they’re practically giving these away – and in the very belly of the National Library of the People’s Republic of China, no less (a bookshop, it must be said, that was hardly as glamorous as its location might suggest, a labyrinthine afterthought with an uninspired selection).

60|$|That was in 1813, after I {{had left}} school, when I was already {{eighteen}} years of age, {{with a good}} forty hairs on my upper lip and every hope of more. I had changed since I left school, and was not so keen on games as I had been, but found myself instead lying about on the sunny side of the braes, with my own lips parted and my eyes staring {{just the same as}} Cousin Edie's used to do. It had satisfied me and filled my whole life that I could run faster and jump higher than my neighbour; but now all that seemed such a little thing, and I yearned, and yearned, {{and looked up at the}} big arching sky, and down at the flat blue sea, and felt that there was something wanting, but could never lay my tongue to what that something was. And I became quick of temper too, for my nerves seemed all of a fret, and when <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> would <b>ask</b> me what ailed me, or my father would speak of my turning my hand to work, I would break into such sharp bitter answers as I have often grieved over since.
