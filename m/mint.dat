5|$|Although {{usually more}} coins were struck at Philadelphia {{than at the}} other mints during the years the coin was struck in silver, only 12,450,181 were struck there in 1955, fewer than at the Denver <b>Mint</b> or at San Francisco. This was due to a sagging economy and a lackluster demand for coins that caused the <b>Mint</b> to {{announce}} in January that the San Francisco <b>Mint</b> would be shuttered {{at the end of}} the year. The 1955 dimes from the three facilities are the lowest mintages by date and <b>mint</b> mark among circulating coins in the series, but are not rare, as collectors stored them away in rolls of 50.|$|E

5|$|In late May 2007, 20th Century Fox {{struck a}} deal with the Franklin <b>Mint</b> to promote the movie by {{altering}} 40,000 U.S. quarters and releasing them into circulation. All of the altered quarters were minted in 2005 and honor the state of California as part of the 50 State Quarters program created by the U.S. <b>Mint.</b> The altered quarters feature the Silver Surfer on the reverse along with a URL to the movie's official website. Once the U.S. <b>Mint</b> became aware of the promotion, it notified the studio and the Franklin <b>Mint</b> that it was breaking the law by turning government-issued currency into private advertising.

5|$|Once Beach {{accepted}} the commission on March 12, 1928, Juliette Fraser's sketches were forwarded to him. On April 7, he sent completed models to the <b>Mint</b> and photographs to the Fine Arts Commission. Both the <b>Mint</b> and Houston responded with criticism, the former that {{the relief of}} the coin was high and difficult to reduce to coin-sized hubs. On April 19, <b>Mint</b> Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock wrote in a memorandum that the coin {{would be very hard}} to produce because the area of greatest relief on each side was in the same part of the design. Beach agreed to lower any high points that might cause the <b>Mint</b> difficulty.|$|E
5|$|Production resumed in 1934, due {{to another}} congressional act; this one {{requiring}} the <b>Mint</b> to purchase {{large quantities of}} domestic silver, a commodity whose price was at a historic low. This Act assured producers of a ready market for their product, with the <b>Mint</b> gaining a large profit in seigniorage, through monetizing cheaply purchased silver—the <b>Mint</b> in fact paid for some shipments of silver bullion in silver dollars. Pursuant to this authorization, over seven million silver Peace dollars were struck in 1934 and 1935. <b>Mint</b> officials gave consideration to striking 1936 silver dollars, and in fact prepared working dies, but as there was no commercial demand for them, none were actually struck. With <b>Mint</b> Chief Engraver Sinnock thinking it unlikely {{that there would be}} future demand for the denomination, the master dies were ordered destroyed in January 1937.|$|E
5|$|Silver half dimes {{had been}} struck {{from the early days}} of the United States <b>Mint</b> in the late 18th century. Those {{disappeared}} from circulation, along with most other coins, in the economic turmoil of the Civil War. In 1864, the <b>Mint</b> successfully introduced low-denomination coins, whose intrinsic worth did not approach their face value. Industrialist Joseph Wharton advocated coins containing nickel—a metal in which he had significant financial interests. When the <b>Mint</b> proposed a copper-nickel five-cent piece, Congress required that the coin be heavier than the <b>Mint</b> had suggested, allowing Wharton to sell more of the metal to the government.|$|E

5|$|The act {{provided}} for {{a maximum of}} 40,000 medals, to be struck at the Philadelphia <b>Mint,</b> from design models prepared by the Norse-American Centennial Commission. Medals would {{be turned over to}} a designated agent of the commission on payment of the cost of producing them. They were to be made subject to the provisions of section 52 of the Coinage Act of 1873. That section permitted medals of a national character to be struck at the Philadelphia <b>Mint,</b> but forbade <b>Mint</b> personnel from making dies for private medals, and was enacted after Philadelphia <b>Mint</b> Chief Coiner Franklin Peale had for some years run a private medals business on <b>Mint</b> premises, prior to his firing in 1854.|$|E
5|$|The dollars were {{produced}} every year between 1878 and 1904 {{at a total}} of 4 different mints. Each <b>mint,</b> {{with the exception of}} Philadelphia, has its own <b>mint</b> mark.

The dollars all bore a <b>mint</b> mark denoting their place of origin: 'P' for the Philadelphia <b>Mint,</b> 'D' for the Denver <b>Mint</b> and 'S' for the San Francisco <b>Mint.</b> The Anthony dollar was the first coin to bear a 'P' <b>mint</b> mark since the Jefferson nickel issued during World War II; other coins struck there were left without a mintmark to note their place of origin. In 1980, the 'P' <b>mint</b> mark was added to all other circulating coins, except the cent, struck in Philadelphia.|$|E
50|$|The {{design and}} {{specifications}} of the English penny were unchanged by the Union, and {{it continued to}} be <b>minted</b> in silver after 1707. Queen Anne's reign saw pennies <b>minted</b> in 1708, 1709, 1710, and 1713. These issues, however, were not for general circulation, instead being <b>minted</b> as Maundy money. The prohibitive cost of <b>minting</b> silver coins had meant the size of pennies had been reduced over the years, with the <b>minting</b> of silver pennies for general circulation being halted in 1660.|$|R
