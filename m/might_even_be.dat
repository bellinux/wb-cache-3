5|$|During World WarII, Brundage {{wrote to}} other IOC members {{that he had}} no {{objection}} to Soviet involvement in international sports, with representation on the IOC, if the USSR joined the international sports federations (ISFs). The IOC required that an NOC be independent of the government of the territory which it represents; there were concerns a Soviet NOC would not be. This was a problem not unique to communist states; a number of Latin Americans countries were starting to bring the local NOCs into the political structure, with an official naming the NOC chair—who <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> the country's political leader. This mixture of sports and politics worried Brundage.|$|E
5|$|In both {{of these}} works the candlelit setting had a realist justification. Viewing {{sculpture}} by candlelight, when the contours showed well and there <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> an impression of movement from the flickering light, was a fashionable practice described by Goethe. In the orrery demonstration the shadows cast by the lamp representing the sun were {{an essential part of}} the display, used to demonstrate eclipses. But there seems no reason other than heightened drama to stage the air pump experiment in a room lit by a single candle, and in two later paintings of the subject by Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo the lighting is normal.|$|E
5|$|In the afternoon, PT-41 and PT-32 {{made their}} way to Tagauayan, where they found PT-34. There was a {{discussion}} about whether to proceed to Mindanao, or wait for Permit. Bulkeley warned that the seas <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> higher. But, since there was no assurance that the submarine would make it, MacArthur decided to continue, departing in daylight at 18:00 so as to be sure to meet their air transport there. Since PT-32 had no fuel to make Mindanao, its passengers were divided between PT-41 and PT-34. Soon after they had departed, PT-35 belatedly arrived at rendezvous point. Akers found the crew of PT-32 there, and discovered that the other two boats had been and gone. He therefore set out for Cagayan de Oro as well.|$|E

25|$|In this view, {{countries}} may develop unsustainable economic bubbles or otherwise mishandle their national economies, and foreign exchange speculators made the inevitable collapse happen sooner. A relatively quick collapse <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> preferable to continued economic mishandling, {{followed by an}} eventual, larger, collapse. Mahathir Mohamad and other critics of speculation are viewed as trying to deflect the blame from themselves for having caused the unsustainable economic conditions.|$|E
25|$|So {{following}} a rough week during which {{it looked like}} the festival <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> cancelled for the year, the event was on again. The commercialization took further root with many more in-your-face sponsors and even the omnipresent MTV coming to Petrovaradin fortress {{for the first time to}} shoot a documentary on Novi Sad and the festival, as well as to publicize a human trafficking awareness campaign. The insatiable British music press also discovered the festival, resulting in some very affirmative reviews in NME and Mojo.|$|E

25|$|The main trunk {{roads were}} {{originally}} {{constructed by the}} Roman army. Responsibility for their regular repair and maintenance rested with designated imperial officials (the curatores viarum), though the cost {{would probably have been}} borne by the local civitas (county) authorities whose territory the road crossed.

However, the final results showed only a narrow lead for Scioli, with his 37.08% just ahead of Macri's 34.15%, leading to new elections on 22 November. Massa got the third place, with 21% of the vote, and both candidates sought to secure the voters that had voted for him. Both candidates were polarized on the opinion about the presidency of Cristina Kirchner: Scioli proposes to keep most of the Kirchnerite policies, and Macri to change them.

25|$|Perhaps Mary's {{failure to}} learn exactly what seeing red feels like {{is simply a}} failure of language, or a failure {{of our ability to}} {{describe}} experiences. An alien race with a different method of communication or description might be perfectly able to teach their version of Mary exactly how seeing the color red would feel. Perhaps it is simply a uniquely human failing to communicate first-person experiences from a third-person perspective. Dennett suggests that the description <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> possible using English. He uses a simpler version of the Mary thought experiment to show how this might work. What if Mary was in a room without triangles and was prevented from seeing or making any triangles? An English-language description of just a few words would be sufficient for her to imagine {{what it is like to}} see a triangle—she can simply and directly visualize a triangle in her mind. Similarly, Dennett proposes, it is perfectly, logically possible that the quale of what it is like to see red could eventually be described in an English-language description of millions or billions of words.|$|E

500|$|A study {{suggested}} that the echolocation subunits were mainly located in the central nervous system, while the subunits in the vocal apparatus were already present and capable of use before echolocation even evolved.

500|$|Portraiture, which survives {{mainly in}} the medium of sculpture, was the most copious form of {{imperial}} art. Portraits during the Augustan period utilize youthful and classical proportions, evolving later into a mixture of realism and idealism. Republican portraits had been characterized by a [...] "warts and all" [...] verism, but {{as early as the}} 2nd century BC, the Greek convention of heroic nudity was adopted sometimes for portraying conquering generals. Imperial portrait sculptures may model the head as mature, even craggy, atop a nude or seminude body that is smooth and youthful with perfect musculature; a portrait head <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> added to a body created for another purpose.

500|$|The subplot of [...] "The Mansion Family", where Mr. Burns gets {{a medical}} examination, was {{inspired}} by Swartzwelder's own visit to a Mayo Clinic.

500|$|However, in 1978 Ronald Lightbown, Keeper of Metalwork at the V Museum, {{rejected}} {{this theory}} on stylistic grounds, {{considering that the}} cup must have been created only shortly before it appeared in Charles VI's inventory in 1391. He says that [...] "in 1380 figure-style was a softly undulating, flowing style, with slender elongated figures and much use of serpentine or curving folds in the drapery, and with trailing dresses ending in sinuous Gothic hem-lines"—a style {{that can be seen}} in the miniature of the coronation of CharlesVI in 1380 illustrated above. In contrast, Lightbown says [...] "the figures on the cup are broad, some <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> called stocky, with soft drapery of cylindrical form, or of smooth, tight outlines. The folds are tubular and the hems of the robes are straight with no waving, trailing outlines. The style in fact is the 'Italianate' manner which developed in France as a result of contact with 'trecento' art, and not the purely Northern Gothic International manner." [...] This view was rejected in 1981 by Neil Stratford, former Keeper of Medieval and Later Antiquities at the British Museum, who pointed to a number of manuscript illuminations in a similar style that date from earlier than 1390. John Cherry, another former Keeper of the medieval collections at the British Museum, still presents the older dating in a work of 2010, and the British Museum website dates the cup to [...] "about 1370–1380".|$|E
500|$|Hybrid Theory {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Stephanie Dickison of PopMatters {{commented that the}} band was a [...] "far more complex and talented group than the hard rock boy bands of late", and claimed that [...] "they will continue to fascinate and challenge music's standard sounds." [...] Q magazine gave Hybrid Theory {{four out of five}} stars. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice wrote that “the men don't know what the angry boys understand”, and gave the album a [...] "two-star honorable mention rating", citing [...] "Papercut" [...] and [...] "Points of Authority" [...] as highlights of the album. Jenny Eliscu of Rolling Stone gave the album {{two and a half stars}} and commented that Hybrid Theory had [...] "as much potency as albums by Limp Bizkit or Korn" [...] and called it an album that [...] "reflects the frustration of life". Considering that the album came out in the year 2000, and that it earned a Diamond certification, it may have exerted a similar rock influence on the up and coming Millennial generation that Nirvana's Nevermind (1991) did for Generation X. It <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> possible to say, because of the popularity of this album, that Linkin Park could be thought of as the [...] "flagship" [...] rock band for the Millennials. This generation tends to gravitate more towards rap and pop music; and having these elements mixed into Linkin Park's style might have played a role in the album's success.|$|E

500|$|After a {{short period}} of inactivity, Dickinson once again teamed up with Roy Z and Tribe of Gypsies to record his next album, Accident of Birth; [...] "It was {{actually}} Roy that dragged me back into some assemblance, because he called up and he said, 'Listen, I've got some stuff and it's like a metal record.' And I wasn't thrilled, I wasn't really sure that I had anything to offer... Then he played me some backing-tracks he'd done for what was to become Accident of Birth down the phone and I thought 'There is something there.'" [...] Former Iron Maiden guitarist, Adrian Smith, was asked to guest on the record, but remained as a full-time member of Dickinson's solo outfit. The album marked a return to heavy metal for Dickinson, with Sputnikmusic remarking, [...] "The album's heavy feel is very satisfying, and definitely fills that void left by Maiden during the 90's." [...] The follow-up, The Chemical Wedding, was a semi-concept album on alchemy, which drew inspiration from William Blake's writings; with some songs, such as [...] "Book of Thel", having the same title as some of his poems, and the cover artwork featuring one of his paintings. The record was even more successful than its predecessor, with Sputnikmusic commenting, [...] "Bruce had shattered all expectations to create an album that <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> better than the previous one." [...] During The Chemical Weddings supporting tour, the live album, Scream for Me Brazil was recorded in São Paulo, after which Dickinson and Smith returned to Iron Maiden in February 1999.|$|E
500|$|As {{part of her}} {{argument}} that women should not be overly influenced by their feelings, Wollstonecraft emphasises {{that they should not}} be constrained by or made slaves to their bodies or their sexual feelings. This particular argument has led many modern feminists to suggest that Wollstonecraft intentionally avoids granting women any sexual desire. Cora Kaplan argues that the [...] "negative and prescriptive assault on female sexuality" [...] is a [...] "leitmotif" [...] of the Rights of Woman. For example, Wollstonecraft advises her readers to [...] "calmly let passion subside into friendship" [...] in the ideal companionate marriage (that is, in the ideal of a love-based marriage that was developing at the time). It would be better, she writes, when [...] "two virtuous young people marry [...] [...] [...] if some circumstances checked their passion". According to Wollstonecraft, [...] "love and friendship cannot subsist in the same bosom". As Mary Poovey explains, [...] "Wollstonecraft betrays her fear that female desire might in fact court man's lascivious and degrading attentions, that the subordinate position women have been given <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> deserved. Until women can transcend their fleshly desires and fleshly forms, they will be hostage to the body." [...] If women are not interested in sexuality, they cannot be dominated by men. Wollstonecraft worries that women are consumed with [...] "romantic wavering", that is, they are interested only in satisfying their lusts. Because the Rights of Woman eliminates sexuality from a woman's life, Kaplan contends, it [...] "expresses a violent antagonism to the sexual" [...] {{while at the same time}} [...] "exaggerat the importance of the sensual in the everyday life of women". Wollstonecraft was so determined to wipe sexuality from her picture of the ideal woman that she ended up foregrounding it by insisting upon its absence. But as Kaplan and others have remarked, Wollstonecraft may have been forced to make this sacrifice: [...] "it is important to remember that the notion of woman as politically enabled and independent [...] fatally linked [...] to the unrestrained and vicious exercise of her sexuality." ...|$|E
