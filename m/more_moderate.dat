5|$|As the 1880 presidential {{elections}} approached, many Democrats remained convinced Tilden had been robbed {{of the presidency}} in 1876. In the House, Tilden supporter Clarkson Nott Potter of New York sought {{an investigation into the}} 1876 election in Florida and Louisiana, hoping that evidence of Republican malfeasance would harm that party's candidate in 1880. The Democratic caucus, including Randall, unanimously endorsed the idea, and the committee convened in May 1878. Some in the caucus wished to investigate the entire election, but Randall and the <b>more</b> <b>moderate</b> members worked to limit the committee's reach to the two disputed states.|$|E

5|$|Despite a {{reputation}} as an able politician and a likable man, during his presidency Pierce served only as a moderator among the increasingly bitter factions that were driving the nation towards civil war. To Pierce, who saw slavery as a question of property rather than morality, the Union was sacred; because of this, he saw the actions of abolitionists, and the <b>more</b> <b>moderate</b> Free Soilers, as divisive and {{as a threat to}} the constitutionally-guaranteed rights of southerners. Although he criticized those who sought to limit or end slavery, he rarely rebuked southern politicians who took extreme position or opposed northern interests.|$|E

Saavedra and Funes thought that, with this change, Moreno would be left in a minority group, unable to advance his more radical measures.|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesTricuspid valve annuloplasty (TVP) {{has been}} {{advocated}} concomitantly with left-sided cardiac surgery {{in case of}} <b>more</b> than <b>moderate</b> tricuspid regurgitation (TR) or tricuspid annular dilation (TAD) (diameter > 40 mm or 21 mm/m²) {{even in the absence}} of significant TR. Data on postoperative right ventricular (RV) remodeling are lacking in such patients. MethodsPreoperative and postoperative echocardiography data from 45 consecutive TVP procedures, performed in mitral valve surgery in a single tertiary center, were retrospectively analyzed and compared with a propensity-matched control group of 33 procedures without concomitant TVP. RV function and geometry was analyzed by measuring RV size, fractional area change, and end-diastolic sphericity index (RVSI = long-axis length/short-axis width) and compared at baseline versus follow-up. ResultsAt a mean follow-up of 5 months, a favorable change in RV geometry was observed in TVP patients (RVSI increased from 1. 99 ± 0. 33 to 2. 21 ± 0. 42; P = . 001), whereas the opposite was observed in the control group (RVSI decreased from 2. 34 ± 0. 52 to 2. 17 ± 0. 13; P = . 05). Only in control patients, indexed RV end-diastolic area increased significantly (P = . 003). In TVP patients, when comparing patients with baseline <b>more</b> than <b>moderate</b> TR (n =  13) to patients with isolated TAD (n =  32), there was a significant decrease in RV end-diastolic area only in the group with <b>more</b> than <b>moderate</b> TR (from 12. 9 ± 3. 5 cm 2 /m 2 to 10. 3 ± 1. 9 cm 2 /m 2; P = . 009). ConclusionsAdding TVP to mitral valve surgery in patients with <b>more</b> than <b>moderate</b> TR or TAD leads to favorable changes in RV geometry and prevents postoperative RV dilation. This is most pronounced in patients with <b>more</b> than <b>moderate</b> TR at baseline...|$|R

Early protests on campus led to firebombing and window-breaking, but Corbally's decision to cancel classes and allow the students to protest without police or administration interference arguably resulted in <b>more</b> <b>moderate</b> protests than at other colleges.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} wing of the Republican party, some of Goldwater's {{political}} positions included anti-communism, an emphasis on total victory in war and opposition to high taxes and government spending. He often criticized the politics of some of his <b>more</b> <b>moderate</b> contemporaries, including President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He criticized some aspects of Eisenhower's economic policy, citing his failure to balance the federal budget. After being written off as too right-wing to successfully wage a presidential campaign, Goldwater actively supported Richard Nixon's campaign against John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election.|$|E

Members of the UMWA local at Shelby Gap maintained that Patton was arrested for clipping a striking miner on a picket line with his pickup truck in the late 1970s. Local law enforcement officials claim no recollection of the incident, and there is no record of an arrest warrant against Patton or an actual arrest.|$|E

Dutch coffeeshops often fly green-yellow-red Ethiopian flags, other symbols of the Rastafari movement, or depiction of palm leaves to indicate that they sell cannabis, {{as a consequence of}} the official ban on direct advertising. This aesthetic attracts many public artists who may be paid to create murals in the coffeeshops and use the Rastafari and reggae related imagery.|$|R

5|$|A popular Congressman {{and former}} Army officer, Hayes was {{considered}} by Ohio Republicans {{to be an}} excellent standard-bearer for the 1867 election campaign. Hayes's political views were <b>more</b> <b>moderate</b> than the Republican party's platform, although he agreed with the proposed amendment to the Ohio state constitution that would guarantee suffrage to black male Ohioans. Hayes's opponent, Allen G. Thurman, made the proposed amendment {{the centerpiece of the}} campaign and opposed black suffrage. Both men campaigned vigorously, making speeches across the state, mostly focusing on the suffrage question. The election was mostly a disappointment to Republicans, as the amendment failed to pass and Democrats gained a majority in the state legislature. Hayes thought at first that he, too, had lost, but the final tally showed that he had won the election by 2,983 votes of 484,603 votes cast.|$|E
5|$|Birds are hunted in many {{countries}} around the world. In the developed world, ducks such as mallard, wigeon, shoveler and teal have for centuries been captured by wildfowlers, while pheasants, partridges, grouse, and snipe are among the terrestrial birds that are hunted for sport, generally with guns. In {{other parts of the}} world, traditional subsistence hunting still continues, as in rural Northern Papua, where cassowaries, crowned pigeons, hornbills and megapodes are captured for food. Seabirds such as muttonbirds, penguins and auks have been hunted for food, formerly with sufficient intensity to threaten many populations and to make some, such as the great auk, extinct. Seabird hunting continues at <b>more</b> <b>moderate</b> levels today, for instance with the traditional Māori harvest of sooty shearwater chicks.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{was equally}} {{controversial}} in internal church politics. He rebuked the Synod of the Western Reserve for de-emphasizing and effectively abandoning {{the office of}} Ruling Elder. He also condemned the governance of Presbyterian missionaries by anyone other than the Presbyterian church. In 1834, he was the chief author of the Act and Testimony, a document summarizing the contentions between the Old and New Schools. The New School resented Breckinridge and those who signed the Act and Testimony, and even some in the Old School camp had hoped for a <b>more</b> <b>moderate</b> course. The differences between the Old and New Schools widened over the teachings of Albert Barnes, and the New School members were ejected from the Presbyterian Church in 1837. Because of his leadership in the Old School-New School controversy, Breckinridge was elected moderator of the Old School branch's General Assembly in 1841.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} public debate in which experts attempt to influence public policy by making recommendations about controversial issues. However the decision to become an expert is taken to be endogenous, and consequently depends on the potential expert's bias.
