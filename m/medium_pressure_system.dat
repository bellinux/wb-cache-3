The contents of the gasholder could only be fed into the <b>medium</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>system</b> with compressor assistance or directly to the low-pressure system if the holder were at least two lifts full. That facility is no longer available, the compressors and No.1 gasholder being more or less intact but out of service by September 1999. The Ekibin gasholder was dismantled earlier in 1999 allegedly to facilitate upgrading of the SE freeway.|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} high energy input {{is one of}} the primary {{limitations}} to the sustainability of centre pivot irrigation. The purpose of this project was to evaluate a relatively new technology known as Low Elevation Spray Application (LESA) irrigation to obtain Saskatchewan specific performance data for this technology. Preliminary studies were conducted on small, research scale, linear and centre pivot systems. Afterwards, a two tower centre pivot irrigation system equipped with standard impact nozzles was modified by the addition of LESA equipment: drop tubes and low pressure nozzles with static spray pads. This system was capable of operating either standard above lateral mounted impact sprinklers or LESA technology on the same piece of land. Later, seven field scale systems with various makes of nozzles and spray pads were added to the study to ensure that the data collected from the research systems was applicable to field conditions. For all of the systems tested the, coefficient of uniformity, application efficiency and specific energy consumption were determined and compared for a variety of wind speeds. Results showed that for the two tower research centre pivot the coefficient of uniformity was similar for impact and LESA technology with static spray pads. The application efficiency for the impact nozzles and low pressure nozzles showed that, while they both had a trend in decreasing efficiency with increasing wind speeds, the low pressure nozzles had a better efficiency at all wind speeds. The trends showed that the application efficiency for the impact nozzles ranged from approximately 69 % to 86 % and the low pressure nozzles ranged from approximately 74 % to 98 % indicating an average efficiency gain of approximately 8 % greater for the LESA technology. The energy consumed by both the impact and LESA systems indicated that both systems had an increasing energy consumption with increasing wind speed. However, the low pressure system showed a trend of using on average, one half of the energy required by the <b>medium</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>system</b> (0. 107 kWh/m 3 as compared to 0. 057 kWh/m 3) to deliver the same amount of water. Field comparisons indicated that the system equipped with the same LESA technology as the research system (drop nozzles and static spray pads) had similar results for coefficient of uniformity, application efficiency and specific energy consumption. Field systems equipped with spinner or rotator spray pads showed an increase in all factors measured. Results indicate that LESA technology offers promise for increasing the efficiency of centre pivot irrigation systems in Saskatchewan...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an overview of}} two Functional Reliability (FR) assessment performed {{for some of the}} Passive Safety Systems (PSS) of a CAREM-like integral advance reactor. The FR can be understood as the success probability of a PSS to fulfill a safety function. The safety function fulfillment is characterized and quantified by a Performance Indicator (PI), which is a measure of how far the system is of the core damage or of a design criterion breaching. PI uncertainties were estimated by means of the Reliability Method for Passive Safety (RMPS), which takes into account the relevant parameters uncertainties. These assessments were made with two different main goals: design verification of the Isolation Condensers (IC), and design improvement of the <b>Medium</b> <b>Pressure</b> Injection <b>System</b> (MPIS). For the first goal, a Station Black-Out (SBO) event was proposed, and for the second one, it was proposed a Small Break Loss of Coolant Accident plus a SBO (SB-LOCA + SBO) event. For this assessment were considered uncertainties in code parameters, besides uncertainties in engineering parameters (design, construction, operation and maintenance), in order to perform Monte Carlo simulations based on a Best Estimate (B-E) plant model (RELAP 5). Response surfaces based on PI were used for improving the FR accuracy of these PSS. Their predictio...|$|R
40|$|Water hydraulics: {{the idea}} of using a nonflammable, {{environmentally}} friendly, cheap, nontoxic fluid in hydraulic systems has a lot of appeal. Water 2 ̆ 7 s renaissance as a working fluid, however, is crowned for only half the kingdom [...] - it has found application in many low and <b>medium</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>systems,</b> but in high-pressure systems, axial piston units of swashplate type and other piston machines subjected to high side loads in the presence of high pressure gradients cannot survive running on water. This is because water is around 30 times less viscous than mineral oil, which gives it an extremely low load-carrying capacity that is especially detrimental for the piston-cylinder tribological interface of the piston machines described. Increasing the load-carrying capacity of this interface would enable such piston machines to operate in systems with a 300 to 420 bar pressure gradient from the low to the high pressure line, e. g. construction machinery, forest machinery, aircraft machinery. A series of simulation studies have been conducted using FSTI, the fluid structure thermal interaction model developed at the Maha Fluid Power Research Laboratory, in order to investigate the effect of minimum clearance, speed, four micro surface shaping forms, and four different material properties on the load-carrying capacity of the piston-cylinder interface of an existing 75 cc axial piston unit of swashplate type. The axial piston unit was chosen on account of the fact that axial piston units of swashplate type suffer from a particularly high side load, turning this into a type of worst-case scenario. The four surface shapes studied are the piston profile developed by Lasaar, the axial sine wave piston profile invented by Ivantysynova, Garrett, and Frederickson, a new version of this profile consisting of axial sine waves that switch between two amplitudes at their inflection points, and wide circumferential grooves in the bushing. It was determined that the last surface profile in that list can effect the greatest change in load-carrying capacity with the least amount of unwanted side-effects out of all profiles examined. The four material properties examined are piston and bushing density, modulus of elasticity, coefficient of thermal expansion, and thermal conductivity. Here it was determined that the modulus of elasticity of the piston, in particular, had the highest level of influence on the pressure distribution of the interface, and thus its load carrying capacity, out of all material properties investigated in this work. Finally, from the simulation studies conducted, it is apparent that a significant improvement in the load-carrying capacity of water-lubricated piston-cylinder interfaces with high side loads is possible. ...|$|R
40|$|The silver-catalyzed {{production}} of ethylene oxide {{is an important}} process in the chemical industry. Though much effort had been invested in mechanistic studies of this reaction, determination of intermediates and surface pathways has been elusive. New techniques involving simultaneous surface and gas phase analysis are believed to offer the greatest potential in acquiring new information about this reaction system. ^ For this investigation, a <b>medium</b> <b>pressure</b> reactor <b>system</b> was constructed and subsequently interfaced with a Texas Instruments PM 550 process control computer. The reaction of ethylene and oxygen over silver wires, foils and treated colloids, was studied over a range of pressures (0. 03 - 10 torr) and temperatures (200 - 315 (DEGREES) C). Kinetic results were easy to analyze due to the well-defined behavior of the reactor. Gas phase compositions were measured using a mass spectrometer; the surface was studied under reaction conditions using surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). This study represents one the the first attempts to employ SERS in ths study of heterogeneous gas phase catalytic systems. ^ An in situ Raman surface analysis of silver under ethylene oxidation reaction conditions revealed the presence of atomically adsorbed oxygen (440 cm(2 ̆ 7 - 1)) and a 2 ̆ 7 carbon-containing 2 ̆ 7 species (1300 - 1600 cm(2 ̆ 7 - 1)) believed to be primarily amorphous carbon. The formation of adsorbate islands on the surface was also observed. The presence of adsorbed chlorine on the silver surface was monitored using SERS (255 cm(2 ̆ 7 - 1)), following the injection of 1, 2 -dichloroethane into the reactor system. The presence of the aforementioned species was confirmed using ex situ Auger electron spectroscopy. ^ Under the conditions mentioned previously, selectivity to ethylene oxide was observed {{to be less than}} 10...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the failure {{probability}} of rubber sealing rings in reciprocating dynamic seal, a new structure of sealing ring based on bionics was designed. The biomimetic ring has three concave ridges and convex bulges on each side which are very similar to earthworms. Bulges were circularly designed and sealing performances of the biomimetic ring in both static seal and dynamic seal were simulated by FEM. In addition, effects of precompression, <b>medium</b> <b>pressure,</b> speed, friction coefficient, and material parameters on sealing performances were discussed. The results show that von Mises stress of the biomimetic sealing ring distributed symmetrically in no-pressure static sealing. The maximum von Mises stress appears on the second bulge of the inner side. High contact stress concentrates on left bulges. Von Mises stress distribution becomes uneven under <b>medium</b> <b>pressure.</b> Both von Mises stress and contact stress increase when precompression, <b>medium</b> <b>pressure,</b> and rubber hardness increase in static sealing.
