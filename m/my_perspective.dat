500|$|On October 18, 2000, de la Rocha {{released}} a statement announcing his departure from the band. He said, [...] "I {{feel that it is}} now necessary to leave Rage because our decision-making process has completely failed. It is no longer meeting the aspirations of all four of us collectively as a band, and from <b>my</b> <b>perspective,</b> has undermined our artistic and political ideal." [...] "There was so much squabbling over everything", explained Morello, [...] "and I mean everything. We would even have fist fights over whether our T-shirts should be mauve or camouflaged! It was ridiculous. We were patently political, internally combustible. It was ugly for a long time".|$|E
500|$|During filming, Cameron {{made use}} of his virtual camera system, {{a new way of}} {{directing}} motion-capture filmmaking. The system shows the actors' virtual counterparts in their digital surroundings in real time, allowing the director to adjust and direct scenes just as if shooting live action. According to Cameron, [...] "It's like a big, powerful game engine. If I want to fly through space, or change <b>my</b> <b>perspective,</b> I can. I can turn the whole scene into a living miniature and go through it on a 50 to 1 scale." [...] Using conventional techniques, the complete virtual world cannot be seen until the motion-capture of the actors is complete. Cameron said this process does not diminish the value or importance of acting. On the contrary, because {{there is no need for}} repeated camera and lighting setups, costume fittings and make-up touch-ups, scenes do not need to be interrupted repeatedly. Cameron described the system as a [...] "form of pure creation where if you want to move a tree or a mountain or the sky or change the time of day, you have complete control over the elements".|$|E

500|$|Lyricist {{and lead}} singer Tim Lambesis has given mixed {{commentary}} on the subject: when asked in 2008 if the members were [...] "a Christian band" [...] or [...] "Christians in a band", Lambesis stated on the band's FAQ, [...] "I'm {{not sure what the}} difference is between five Christians playing in a band and a Christian band, If you truly believe something, then it should affect every area of your life. All five of us are Christians. I believe that change should start with me first, and as a result, our lyrics do not come across very 'preachy.' Many of our songs are about life, struggles, mistakes, relationships and other issues that don't fit entirely in the spiritual category. However, all of these topics are written about through <b>my</b> <b>perspective</b> as a Christian." [...] Furthermore, during an August 2010 radio interview on the Christian metal radio show The Full Armor of God Broadcast, Lambesis stated [...] "I can only really write about what I'm passionate about in life, so naturally my faith, my belief in the teachings of Jesus and His resurrection come across in our lyrics." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} album, Wentz drew lyrical {{inspiration}} from rapper Lil Wayne, whom he called [...] "the best lyricist of [...]" [...] Speaking of Infinity on Highs lyrical themes, Wentz stated, [...] "On the last record, the lyrics were about 'This is where we're {{going to be}} a year from now, and this is what you're going to be saying about us.' But this time, we realized that a lot of bands should spend less time running their mouths and more time writing their songs." [...] In 2013, Wentz reflected, [...] "on a record like Infinity on High, I feel like I tried really hard to explain <b>my</b> <b>perspective</b> – and when I look back on it in hindsight I think it’s an extremely unrelatable record. Critics felt that much of the lyrics address the band's rise to fame and the pressure of maintaining a loyal fanbase. Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker commented that [...] "The only top-ten acts that talk about fame as much as Fall Out Boy does are rappers, although their take on selling records is less conflicted." [...] Cory Apar of Allmusic opined that [...] "Wentz' lyrics are oftentimes resentful, full of fame-induced angst, and really emphasize his need to drive home his position that stardom has not changed the band." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Garfield {{was given}} the role of Tommy, a well-meaning, rather dim young person who struggles {{to find a place}} in an {{environment}} which values imagination and creativity above all. He said of his character, [...] "There's a sense of anxiety that runs through these kids, especially Tommy, because he's so sensory and feeling and animalistic, that's <b>my</b> <b>perspective</b> of him." [...] Garfield was attracted to the film based on the existential questions the story expresses. He called the experience of being a part of Never Let Me Go a [...] "dream to come true". Garfield enjoys an opportunity to let loose with his roles. He said the scenes in which his character—unable to contain his frustration—erupts with a wail, was [...] "intense" [...] for him. [...] "I think those screams are inside all of us, I just got a chance to let mine out". Before shooting the film, he had read the screenplay and the book. In March 2009 Daily Variety reported that Knightley was signed to the project. Knightley admitted that she only agreed to appear in Never Let Me Go because co-star and friend Mulligan had asked her to. She portrays Ruth, a zealous, ambitious character who behaves manipulatively out of inner insecurity. When asked what she did and did not have in common with her character, Knightley said she was unable to relate to Ruth's situation of being involved in a love triangle.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a phenomenological {{study in}} which I endeavour to uncover {{the essence of what}} animates us beneath the dance by investigating the lived experiences of bodily perceptions generated while dancing. I present four perspectives to illuminate this essence. In <b>my</b> first <b>perspective,</b> I offer literature from a variety of phenomenologists, dancers and choreographers which substantiate vital and spiritual perceptions generated while dancing. In <b>my</b> second <b>perspective,</b> I conduct an autobiographical inquiry and recollect my childhood experiences of dance. In <b>my</b> third <b>perspective,</b> I present an historic narrative about the lives of my dance mentors Gertrud and Magda Hanova which is of significant historical importance for dance history to Vancouver. In <b>my</b> fourth <b>perspective,</b> looking through the lens of phenomenology and drawing on performative inquiry, I present textual reflections written by grade four students, which explore the children’s dancing experiences. In conclusion, I stress the need to return again and again to the dancing body in order to experience revitalization and renewal. I explore the significance of dance for teaching and learning and expand on how this study may inform education. This work is an invitation to celebrate returning to the dancing body and to honour the divinity of the dance in each person...|$|R

He said of his character, Tommy D., [...] "There's a sense of anxiety that runs through these kids, especially Tommy, because he's so sensory and feeling and animalistic, that's <b>my</b> <b>perspective</b> of him."

[...] "I think those screams are inside all of us, I just got a chance to let mine out". For his portrayal of a well-meaning, but dim young man caught in a love triangle, he won the 2010 Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor. Cleveland Magazine Clint O'Connor lauded his performance, commenting that Garfield delivered [...] "a terrifically anguished performance" [...] in the film. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman praised the performances of the lead cast, reflecting that [...] "these three all act with a spooky, haunted innocence that gets under your skin." [...] Tom Preston, a critic from The Guardian, further described Garfield's acting as solid and [...] "at times deeply moving".
