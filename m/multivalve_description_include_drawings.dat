40|$|The genus Psycharium is revised for {{the first}} time. Until now, only a drawing of the female type species was known. The male and female of the type species, P. pellucens Herrich-Schäffer, and four new species, montanum, kammanassiense, bamardi and natalense, are {{comprehensively}} described. A key to the species of Psycharium, based on males and females (except for P. natalense where only males are known), is given. <b>Descriptions</b> of taxa <b>include</b> <b>drawings</b> of their genitalia.

40|$|In 1997, OECD/CSNI {{approved}} {{testing the}} mixing associated with inadvertent injection of a boron-dilute slug in a PWR primary system as International Standard Problem No. 43. The tests were {{performed in the}} UM 2 x 4 Loop, a reduced-height, reduced-pressure scale model of the TMI 2 reactor system. The experimental program consisted of four test series, which increased in realism from separate effect to integral facility. Participants collaborated with the UM 2 x 4 Loop staff in establishing key aspects of the experiment such as figures of merit and the simulation boundary. The facility <b>description</b> <b>included</b> CAD <b>drawings</b> of the system. The nominal test of series A was repeated 18 times to establish an experimental uncertainty band. It became clear that, while these tests agreed {{with respect to the}} global figure of merit, the flow patterns fell in two distinct groups. Small variations in initial/boundary conditions caused a change in Fr number that induced the different flow patterns.

40|$|The exotic Indo-West-Pacific species, Ficopomatus uschakovi (Polychaeta, Serpulidae) is {{recorded}} {{for the first}} time in the Tropical Eastern Pacific from two sites in La Encrucijada Biosphere Reserve, Chiapas, a coastal lagoon in the Pacific south of Mexico. The means of dispersal of this serpulid species still remains unclear, as the nearest port (Puerto Chiapas) is 70 km to the south, and there are no port installations or shrimp cultures in the lagoon. The record of this serpulid species, apparently widely distributed in this coastal lagoon, has implications regarding possible effects on the brackish-water ecosystem, since the invasion event very well may have occurred several years ago. It is recommended that an exhaustive study be carried out in the coastal lagoons of Chiapas to evaluate the real distribution and the effects of this invasive species on the ecosystem.

40|$|Third-stage larvae of the Pseudoterranova decipiens species complex (also {{known as}} sealworms) have been {{reported}} in at least 40 marine fish species belonging to 21 families and 10 orders along the South American coast. Sealworms are a cause for concern because they can infect humans who consume raw or undercooked fish. However, despite their economic and zoonotic importance, morphological and molecular characterization of species of Pseudoterranova in South America is still scarce. Methods: A total of 542 individual fish from 20 species from the Patagonian coast of Argentina were examined for sealworms. The body cavity, the muscles, internal organs, and the mesenteries were examined to detect nematodes. Sealworm larvae were removed from their capsules and fixed in 70 % ethanol. For molecular identification, partial fragments of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (cox 1) were amplified for 10 isolates from 4 fish species. Morphological and morphometric data of sealworms were also obtained. Results: A total of 635 larvae were collected from 12 fish species. The most infected fish was Prionotus nudigula, followed by Percophis brasiliensis, Acanthistius patachonicus, Paralichthys isosceles, and Pseudopercis semifasciata. Sequences obtained for the cox 1 of sealworms from A. patachonicus, P. isosceles, P. brasiliensis and P. nudigula formed a reciprocally monophyletic lineage with published sequences of adult specimens of Pseudoterranova cattani from the South American sea lion Otaria flavescens, and distinct from the remaining 5 species of Pseudoterranova. A morphological <b>description,</b> <b>including</b> <b>drawings</b> and scanning electron microscopy photomicrographs of these larvae is provided. Sealworms collected from Argentinean fishes did not differ in their diagnostic traits from the previously described larvae of P. cattani. However a discriminant analysis suggests that specimens from P. nudigula were significantly larger than those from other fishes. Most of the sealworms were collected encapsulated from the muscles and, to a lesser degree, from the mesenteries and the liver. Conclusions: We provided the first molecular identification, morphological description and microhabitat characterization of sealworm larvae from the Argentinean Patagonian coast. We also reported the infection levels of sealworms on 20 fish species in order to elucidate the life cycle of these nematodes in this area. Fil: Hernández Orts, Jesús Servando.
