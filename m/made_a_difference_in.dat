5|$|Monster Inc. is an American {{company that}} {{manufactures}} and markets about 6,000 products, but {{is best known}} for audio and video cables. It also produces speakers, headphones, power strips, mobile accessories and audio devices for automobiles. The company was founded by an audiophile and engineer, Noel Lee, in 1979 by experimenting with different ways to build audio cables. It grew by doing demonstrations to convince the industry that audio cables <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> audio quality and by establishing relationships with retailers that were attracted to the cable's profit margins.|$|E
5|$|When the {{projects}} begin, {{the work is}} done without machines, with supplies being shipped on small boats and then carried by hand from the beach. Project costs range between $5,000 and $150,000, although the average is between $20,000 and $25,000. The protected areas that result from these deals typically involve a 20- to 30-year commitment. Seacology hopes that during that time the local people grow to respect these resources and ideally progress {{to a point where}} they are less dependent on natural resources. According to marine biologist Mark Erdmann, in a worst-case scenario, if the people violate the contract and destroy the habitat, Seacology will have still <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> their lives through its low-cost investment, whereas larger conservation organizations might invest large sums of money but through not addressing the immediate needs of the people, if the project fails, both lose that investment and not have helped the community.|$|E

5|$|Durkheim {{believed}} {{there was more to}} suicide than extremely personal individual life circumstances: for example, a loss of a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, he took suicide and explained it as a social fact instead of a result of one’s circumstances. Durkheim believed that suicide was an instance of social deviance. Social deviance being any transgression of socially established norms. He created a normative theory of suicide focusing on the conditions of group life. The four different types of suicide that he proposed are egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic. He began by plotting social regulation on the x-axis of his chart, and social integration on the y-axis. Egoistic suicide corresponds to a low level of social integration. When one is not well integrated into a social group it can lead to a feeling that he or she has not <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> anyone’s lives. On the other hand, too much social integration would be altruistic suicide. This occurs when a group dominates the life of an individual to a degree where they feel meaningless to society. Anomic suicide occurs when one has an insufficient amount of social regulation. This stems from the sociological term anomie meaning a sense of aimlessness or despair that arises from the inability to reasonably expect life to be predictable. Lastly, there is fatalistic suicide, which results from too much social regulation. An example of this would be when one follows the same routine day after day. This leads to he or she believing there is nothing good to look forward to. Durkheim suggested this was the most popular form of suicide for prisoners.|$|E

25|$|A JAG Manual {{investigation}} commenced {{immediately after}} the fire, in accordance with Navy policy. The investigation determined that the initial explosion was caused by overheating of the Zuni rocket by the huffer exhaust. Investigators also determined that although concerns about the exhaust and placement of the huffer were raised by an airman who observed the exhaust, the personnel to whom the concerns were raised were involved in other tasks, and may not have completely understood {{what was being said}} due to the ambient noise on the flight deck; however, the investigators also noted that moving the unit may not have <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> whether the initial explosion occurred or not, due to the estimated temperature of the rocket by that time. The investigation also revealed that flight-deck personnel did not have an understanding of ordnance cook-off times, and as a result may not have had an appreciation of the hazards posed by live ordnance on the flight deck. Among the items deemed to have had some sort of impact of firefighting operations were lack of redundancies in communication systems and firefighting system controls and components; lack of communication between the Air Boss, who was responsible for flight and hangar deck firefighting, and the Damage Control Assistant, who was responsible for all other firefighting operations; and overtasking of the fire-main system due to activation of multiple systems at once.|$|E

But he maintained that [...] "chatting in a living room face to face is still a very important feature of campaigning here. I don't think you can come in here and do sort of a wholesale political operation from [...] with a pit stop here and there and a media campaign behind you." [...] At the end of February, Dodd differentiated himself from his Democratic counterparts by stating his support for the Bush administration's willingness to hold joint talks with Iran and Syria and by stating that as president he would avoid talking with Iran as long as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad remained as president.
