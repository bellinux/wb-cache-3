5|$|Calhoun's basic {{concern for}} {{protecting}} the diversity of minority interests is expressed in his chief contribution to political science—the idea of a concurrent majority across different groups as distinguished from a numerical majority. A concurrent majority is {{a system in which}} a minority group is permitted to exercise a sort of veto power over actions of a <b>majority</b> <b>that</b> are believed to infringe upon the minority's rights.|$|E
5|$|The Republic of Adygea, an enclave within Krasnodar Krai {{located at}} {{the foothills of the}} Caucasus Mountains, is a federal subject of Russia. It was {{originally}} established in 1922 as the Cherkess (Adyghe) Autonomous Oblast within the Russian SFSR for the Adyghe (Circassian) <b>majority</b> <b>that</b> lived in the area. As of the 2010 Census, Adyghe people accounted for 25.2% of the republic's population (107,048 people), while Russians accounted for the majority 63.6% (270,714 people).|$|E

5000|$|Although {{there are}} {{situations}} when section 1 of the Charter {{would allow for}} a justified limitation on the 'immediacy' requirement for rights to counsel, the <b>majority</b> concluded <b>that</b> a case had not been made out for allowing some type of limitation for investigative questioning. The <b>majority</b> found <b>that</b> the argument {{was based on a}} broader interpretation of [...] "detention" [...] than was decided in Grant. Since the <b>majority</b> ruled <b>that</b> the police are allowed to interact with the public without engaging an investigative detention, {{there was no need to}} create a section 1 limitation.|$|R

5|$|The four justices who {{disagreed}} with the majority filed three separate dissenting opinions. All of the dissenting justices supported the Afroyim v. Rusk principle that retention of US citizenship was a constitutionally protected right, and they all agreed (contrary to the court's <b>majority)</b> <b>that</b> Terrazas's actions should not {{have led to the}} loss of his citizenship.|$|E
5|$|A case {{in which}} the Taft Court struck down {{regulation}} that generated a dissent from the chief justice was Adkins v. Children's Hospital. Congress had decreed a minimum wage for women in the District of Columbia. A 5–3 majority of the Supreme Court struck it down. Justice Sutherland wrote for the <b>majority</b> <b>that</b> the recently ratified Nineteenth Amendment, guaranteeing women the vote, meant that the sexes were equal when it came to bargaining power over working conditions; Taft, in dissent, deemed this unrealistic. Taft's dissent in Adkins was rare both because he authored few dissents, and because {{it was one of the}} few times he took an expansive view of the police power of the government.|$|E
5|$|As well as rugby sevens, {{baseball}} and softball, which were {{dropped from the}} Olympic programme in 2005, karate, squash, golf and roller sports (inline speed skating) were all seeking {{to be included in}} the 2016 games and leaders of the seven sports made formal presentations to the IOC executive board in June 2009. A new system was in place at this session in which a sport now needs only a simple majority rather than the two-thirds <b>majority</b> <b>that</b> was required before.|$|E
50|$|Brewer was {{an active}} member of the Supreme Court, writing often in both concurring and dissenting opinions. He was a major {{contributor}} to the doctrine of substantive due process, arguing that certain activities are entirely outside government control. In his time he frequently sided with the Court's <b>majorities</b> <b>that</b> struck down property rights restrictions.|$|R
50|$|Since the <b>majority</b> found <b>that</b> {{there was}} an {{infringement}} of the Charter, the next issue was whether the evidence should be excluded under section 24(2). In applying the test in R. v. Collins (which has since been overtaken by the test in R. v. Grant, the <b>majority</b> found <b>that</b> the evidence should be excluded, as the breath samples were compelled by statute. The <b>majority</b> also found <b>that</b> if the Crown wants to argue that a detainee {{would have made the}} same decision notwithstanding a Charter infringement, the Crown has the burden of proving <b>that.</b> The <b>majority</b> ultimately found <b>that</b> a court must not speculate on what a detainee might have done or said.|$|R

5|$|During Brown's {{tenure in}} the New York State Senate his Democratic Party {{was in the}} minority. He {{was part of the}} <b>majority</b> <b>that</b> backed New York Governor George Pataki's 2001 plan to build up to three Western New York casinos on Seneca Indian land. The {{legislation}} was controversial because it granted slot machine rights to casino operators {{for the first time in}} New York State. Both of the previous casinos used video gambling machines with debit cards. Brown supported the casinos as a way to support the local economy. When the casino was completed in 2003, he was on the seven-member commission that was to apportion the state's agreed 18% share of the slot machine revenue, amounting to approximately $40million.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{have since}} {{connected}} {{the success of}} Save Our Children with the organization of conservative Christian participation in political processes. Although forceful Christian involvement had not taken a widespread role in politics in the United States since 1925, within two years the Reverend Jerry Falwell developed a coalition of conservative religious groups named the Moral <b>Majority</b> <b>that</b> influenced the Republican Party to incorporate a social agenda in national politics. Homosexuality, the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), abortion, and pornography were among the issues most central to the Moral Majority's priorities until it folded in 1989. For many gay people, the surprise at the outcome of all the campaigns in 1977 and 1978 instilled a new determination and consolidated activism and communities in many cities where the gay community had not been politically active.|$|E
5|$|In Brody v. Village of Port Chester (2003 and 2005), a takings case, Sotomayor first {{ruled in}} 2003 for a {{unanimous}} panel that a property owner in Port Chester, New York {{was permitted to}} challenge the state's Eminent Domain Procedure Law. A district court subsequently rejected the plaintiff's claims and upon appeal the case found itself again with the Second Circuit. In 2005, Sotomayor ruled with a panel <b>majority</b> <b>that</b> the property owner's due process rights had been violated by lack of adequate notice to him of his right to challenge a village order that his land {{should be used for}} a redevelopment project. However, the panel supported the village's taking of the property for public use.|$|E

5|$|The electoral <b>majority</b> <b>that</b> {{brought the}} Democrats {{to power in}} 1951 {{combined}} organization Democrats with reform-minded independents. While successful in winning the election, the coalition started to fray soon after taking office. By 1954, however, Democrat James Hugh Joseph Tate and others in Council attempted to weaken the civil service reforms of the new charter by allowing city employees to be active in party politics. Dallas stood with the reform wing of the party, and the amendment effort fell {{just short of the}} two-thirds vote in Council to put the proposed charter amendment on the ballot. In doing so, Dallas worked against the wishes of Democratic City Committee chairman William J. Green, Jr., siding instead with the reform-minded mayor, Joseph S. Clark, Jr.|$|E
5|$|With Ulysses S. Grant {{elected to}} the Presidency in 1868, Congress had a more willing partner in Reconstruction. The 40th Congress's lame duck session passed the Fifteenth Amendment, which {{guaranteed}} {{that the right to}} vote could not be restricted because of race; Sherman joined the two-thirds <b>majority</b> <b>that</b> voted for its passage. The 41st Congress passed the Enforcement Act of 1870 to enforce its civil rights Amendments among a hostile Southern population. That Act, written by John Bingham of Ohio to mirror the Fourteenth Amendment, created penalties for violating another person's constitutional rights. The next year, Congress passed the Ku Klux Klan Act, which strengthened the Enforcement Act by allowing federal trials and federal troops to be used. Sherman voted in favor of both Acts, which had Grant's support.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the tribute}} and a {{negotiation}} between Laoshang Chanyu (r.174–160 BC) and Emperor Wen (r.180–157 BC) to reopen border markets, {{many of the}} Chanyu's Xiongnu subordinates chose not to obey the treaty and periodically raided Han territories south of the Great Wall for additional goods. In a court conference assembled by Emperor Wu (r.141–87 BC) in 135 BC, the majority consensus of the ministers was to retain the heqin agreement. Emperor Wu accepted this, despite continuing Xiongnu raids. However, a court conference the following year convinced the <b>majority</b> <b>that</b> a limited engagement at Mayi involving {{the assassination of the}} Chanyu would throw the Xiongnu realm into chaos and benefit the Han. When this plot failed in 133 BC, Emperor Wu launched a series of massive military invasions into Xiongnu territory. Chinese armies captured one stronghold after another and established agricultural colonies to strengthen their hold. The assault culminated in 119 BC at the Battle of Mobei, where the Han commanders Huo Qubing (d.117 BC) and Wei Qing (d.106 BC) forced the Xiongnu court to flee north of the Gobi Desert.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of Sunkist v. Sunkist and Quaker Oats Co. v. General Mills, the court created a long-standing {{precedent}} in their decision {{making it possible for}} different companies to use the same brand and product name as long as they produced dissimilar products. In another case, the court set a short-lived precedent allowing companies to artificially raise prices in local markets if the purpose was to artificially lower prices in another market to remain competitive. After Minton joined the U.S. Supreme Court, the decision was appealed to that body; Minton recused himself from the case, which the court decided to overturn. In another decision, Minton was in the <b>majority</b> <b>that</b> ruled under the Sherman Antitrust Act that the New York Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company was a monopoly, ordering the company to break up its grocery business. Minton was also in the majority in several cases filed to enforce decisions made by the National Labor Relations Board, usually to end worker strikes.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln {{took office}} on March 4, 1861. Among his first acts was to {{nominate}} Senator Salmon P. Chase of Ohio to be Secretary of the Treasury. Chase resigned his Senate seat on March 7, and {{after two weeks}} of indecisive balloting, the Ohio Legislature elected Sherman to the vacant seat. He took his seat on March 23, 1861, as the Senate had been called into special session to deal with the secession crisis. The Senate that convened {{at the start of the}} 37th Congress had a Republican majority for the first time, a <b>majority</b> <b>that</b> grew as more Southern members resigned or were expelled. In April, Sherman's brother William visited Washington to rejoin the army, and the brothers went together to the White House to meet Lincoln. Lincoln soon called for 75,000 men to enlist for three months to put down the rebellion, which William Sherman thought too few and too short a duration. William's thoughts on the war greatly influenced his brother, and John Sherman returned home to Ohio to encourage enlistment, briefly serving as an unpaid colonel of Ohio Volunteers.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{had been}} {{building}} among the base's staff in recent days, and most suspected that an attack would come {{against one of the}} border stations in the near future. Ample evidence of the coming attack was discovered by British patrols, but signs of enemy troop movements were disregarded and newly cleared positions were mistaken for ambush sites. Thus the base was continually left with the bare minimum number of men as the <b>majority</b> <b>that</b> could be spared went out on patrol. As a result of these conditions, only 36 men were present in the base {{in the early morning hours}} of 27 April 1965 when it came under ferocious attack by 150 to 400 Indonesian troops, supported by artillery and rocket fire. Immediately, the Indonesians swarmed into one segment of the trenches and destroyed one of the two mortars.|$|E
40|$|A large {{bipartisan}} {{majority of}} Americans oppose permanent U.

A large <b>majority</b> thinks <b>that</b> the United States should be willing to accept a new Iraqi government setting a timeline for the withdrawal of U.
