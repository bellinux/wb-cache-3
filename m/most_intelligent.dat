5|$|Her {{childhood}} was spent at her father's homes, including Pavlovsk Palace and estates in the Crimea. Her {{father was a}} younger brother of Alexander II, and her mother {{was considered one of}} the <b>most</b> <b>intelligent</b> and elegant women of the court. Olga was particularly close to her older brother, Nicholas, {{and was one of the}} few members of the imperial family to keep in touch with him after he was banished to Tashkent.|$|E
5|$|Like many working dogs, the Australian Cattle Dog {{has high}} energy levels, an active mind, and {{a level of}} independence. The breed ranks 10th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, rated {{as one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>intelligent</b> dogs ranked by {{obedience}} command trainability. The Cattle Dog needs plenty of exercise, companionship and a job to do, so a non-working dog might participate in dog sports, learning tricks, or other activities that engage its body and mind.|$|E

5|$|Orangutans {{are among}} the <b>most</b> <b>intelligent</b> primates. Experiments suggest they can figure out some {{invisible}} displacement problems with a representational strategy. In addition, Zoo Atlanta has a touch-screen computer where their two Sumatran orangutans play games. Scientists hope the data they collect will help researchers learn about socialising patterns, such as whether the apes learn behaviours {{through trial and error}} or by mimicry, and point to new conservation strategies.|$|E
5|$|Orangutans {{are among}} the <b>most</b> <b>intelligent</b> primates; they {{use a variety of}} {{sophisticated}} tools and construct elaborate sleeping nests each night from branches and foliage. The apes have been extensively studied for their learning abilities. There may even be distinctive cultures within populations. Field studies of the apes were pioneered by primatologist Birutė Galdikas. All three orangutan species are considered to be critically endangered. Human activities have caused severe declines in populations and ranges. Threats to wild orangutan populations include poaching, habitat destruction, and the illegal pet trade. Several conservation and rehabilitation organisations are dedicated to the survival of orangutans in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Stan and Kyle meet Wendy at Stark's Pond, {{where she}} {{suggests}} using the machine lodged inside Cartman {{to contact the}} visitors. To lure them back, the children tie Cartman to a tree and, {{the next time he}} farts, a massive satellite dish emerges from his anus. The alien spaceship arrives and Ike jumps to safety. In the meantime, the visitors communicate with the cows in the area, having found them to be the <b>most</b> <b>intelligent</b> species on the planet. Cartman is again abducted by the aliens and returns to the bus stop the following day with pinkeye.|$|E

5|$|During the menstrual {{period of}} the older queen, Ambika, Satyavati invited Vyasa to Ambika's bedchamber. However, during sex with Vyasa, Ambika noticed his dark {{appearance}} and closed her eyes. Vyasa declared to Satyavti that due to Ambika's cruelty, her son would be blind (but strong) and have a hundred sons – later known as Kauravas (descendants of Kuru). Satyavati considered such an heir to be an unworthy king, so she asked Vyasa to have niyoga with her other daughter-in-law. During their niyoga, Ambalika fell pale due to Vyasa's grim appearance. As the result the child would be wan, Vyasa told his mother, who begged for another child. In due course, the blind Dhritarashtra and the pale Pandu were born. Satyavati again invited Vyasa to Ambika's bedchamber; she remembered Vyasa's grim appearance (and repulsive odour), and substituted a Shudra (lowest caste) maid in her place. The maid respected the sage and was not afraid of him, and Vyasa thus blessed her; her son would be the <b>most</b> <b>intelligent</b> man, and she {{would no longer be}} a slave. Vyasa told Satyavti of the deception, and then disappeared; Vidura, an incarnation of the god Dharma, was born to the maid.|$|E
5|$|Gordon {{is written}} {{as having a}} genius-level intellect and {{naturally}} possessing a photographic memory. She is described by Gail Simone as the <b>most</b> <b>intelligent</b> member of the Batman family and among all characters having operated out of Gotham City. Prior to the character's career as a vigilante, Barbara Gordon developed many technological skills, including vast knowledge of computers and electronics, expert skills as a hacker, and graduate training in library sciences. Like Batman, Barbara Gordon originally used {{a wide variety of}} computer electronics and gadgets during her early adventures as Batgirl. These included an infrared scanner built into the cowl of her costume, various bat-inspired weaponry, and the Batcycle. According to Gail Simone, Oracle maintains control over the twelve technologically advanced satellites that were created by Lex Luthor during his tenure as President of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Some birds, {{especially}} corvids and parrots, {{are among}} the <b>most</b> <b>intelligent</b> animals; several bird species make and use tools, and many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of culture. Many species annually migrate great distances. Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and bird songs, and participating in such social behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially monogamous (referring to social living arrangement, distinct from genetic monogamy), usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. Other species have breeding systems that are polygynous (arrangement of one male with many females) or, rarely, polyandrous (arrangement of one female with many males). Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual reproduction. They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. Most birds have {{an extended period of}} parental care after hatching. Some birds, such as hens, lay eggs even when not fertilised, though unfertilised eggs do not produce offspring.|$|E

5|$|Murray {{is known}} for {{being one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>intelligent</b> tacticians on the court, often {{constructing}} points. Other strengths in his game, although not huge parts of his game, include a well-disguised drop shot and his net game. As he plays predominantly from the baseline, he usually approaches the net to volley when finishing points more quickly. Murray is most proficient on a fast surface, like grass, where he has won eight singles titles including the Wimbledon Championships and the 2012 Olympic Gold Medal, although hard courts are his preferred surface. He has worked hard since 2008 on improving his clay court game, ultimately winning his first clay titles during 2015 at Munich and Madrid, as well as reaching his first French Open final during 2016. While Murray's serve is a major weapon for him, with his first serve reaching speeds of 130mph or higher on some occasions and winning him many free points, it can become inconsistent when hit under pressure, especially with a more vulnerable and slower second serve. Since his 2011 season and Ivan Lendl's coaching, Murray has played a more offensive game and has also worked to improve his second serve, forehand, consistency and mental game which have all been crucial to his further success.|$|E
5|$|The forest cobra {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{frequent}} causes of snake bite among the African cobras, largely due its forest-dwelling habits but a bite by this species should be taken very seriously because it ranks as the 4th most venomous Naja (True Cobra) species. The symptomology is thought to be very {{similar to that of the}} Egyptian cobra (Naja haje). Clinical experience with this species has been very sparse, and few recorded bites have been documented. Deaths from respiratory failure due to severe neurotoxicity have been reported, but most victims will survive if prompt administration of antivenom is undertaken as soon as clinical signs of envenomation have been noted. Rare cases of spontaneous recoveries without the use of specific antivenom have also been seen; however, neglecting the use of antivenom places the patient at increased risk for major morbidity and mortality. If the snake becomes cornered or is agitated, it can quickly attack the aggressor, and because a large amount of venom is injected, a rapidly fatal outcome is possible. The mortality rate of an untreated bite is not exactly known but it is thought to be quite high. The forest cobra does not spit or spray its venom. This species is considered to be among the <b>most</b> <b>intelligent</b> of the African elapids by herpetologists.|$|E
25|$|The Eurasian magpie {{is one of}} the <b>most</b> <b>intelligent</b> birds, and it is {{believed}} {{to be one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>intelligent</b> of all non-human animals.

25|$|Studies with captive {{birds have}} given insight into which birds are the <b>most</b> <b>intelligent.</b> While parrots have the {{distinction}} of being able to mimic human speech, studies with the African grey parrot have shown that some are able to associate words with their meanings and form simple sentences (see Alex). Parrots and the corvid family of crows, ravens, and jays are considered the <b>most</b> <b>intelligent</b> of birds. Not surprisingly, research has shown that these species tend to have the largest HVCs. Dr. Harvey J. Karten, a neuroscientist at UCSD who has studied the physiology of birds, has discovered that the lower parts of avian brains {{are similar to those of}} humans.|$|E
