40|$|Abstract. Perfusion {{studies in}} swine with early lesions of {{osteochondrosis}} demonstrated that lamellar areas of chondrocyte necrosis within reserve zones of growth areas occurred only in regions of nonperfused articular cartilage. Articular cartilage {{with a similar}} anatomical location was perfused in some animals. Occasionally, nonperfused articular cartilage showed vascular alterations within cartilage canals without evidence of significant perivascular or lamellar necrosis. By light microscopy, some vessels within or adjacent to nonperfused articular cartilage had normal morphology; however, ultrastructural abnormalities were found in some vessels of all cartilage canals adjacent to necrotic cartilage lamella. Minimal alterations were in the few cartilage <b>canal</b> <b>vessels</b> that appeared normal by light microscopy, and the surrounding chondrocytes showed only minimal alterations. Early cartilage canal alterations were seen in the endothelium of cartilage canal capillaries, and ultrastructural changes in these vessels {{were similar to those}} described with experimentally induced, direct vascular injury. Vascular injury was followed by leakage of plasma and cells into the interstitial space of the cartilage canal. Necrosis of the vessel wall and interstitial tissue caused the cartilage canals to appear empty or to be filled with fibrin-like material. Although the vascular changes could be considered as part of the normal process of cartilage maturation and cartilage canal chondrification, observations suggest that in domestic swine the attendant cartilage necrosis and chondrolysis is exuberant. It is suggested that alterations in cartilage <b>canal</b> <b>vessels</b> play a majo...|$|R

40|$|Purpose Cartilage <b>canal</b> <b>vessels</b> are {{critical}} to the normal function of epiphyseal (growth) cartilage and damage to these vessels is demonstrated or suspected in several important develop-mental orthopaedic diseases. High-resolution, three-dimensional (3 -D) visualization of carti-lage canals has recently been demonstrated using susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI). In the present study, a quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) approach is evaluated for 3 -D visualization of the cartilage canals. It is hypothesized that QSM post-processing improves visualization of the cartilage canals by resolving artifacts present in the standard SWI post-processing while retaining sensitivity to the cartilage canals. Methods Ex vivo distal femoral specimens from 3 - and 8 -week-old piglets and a 1 -month-old human cadaver were scanned at 9. 4 T with a 3 -D gradient recalled echo sequence suitable for SWI and QSM post-processing. The human specimen and the stifle joint of a live, 3 -week-old piglet also were scanned at 7. 0 T. Datasets were processed using the standard SW...|$|R

40|$|December 2008 The {{proposed}} {{expansion of}} the Panama Canal will have significant impacts on shipping routes, port development, cargo distribution {{and a host of}} others to the U. S. maritime system. One of its greatest impacts will be felt in the fast-growing container trade where expansion will enable larger vessels to transit the <b>canal.</b> <b>Vessel</b> calls on the East and Gulf Coasts are also expected to increase significantly as cargo shifts away from the congested West Coast. The challenge is predicting the timing and extent of the impacts as well as the location of the impacts on fleets and cargo, i. e., which ports will be impacted? Many Corps planners and decision makers are concerned about these uncertainties and are seeking guidance in developing their assumptions, forecasts and data needs for their navigation studies. This paper summarizes the experiences in the field along with the challenges given the Panama Canal Expansion project. The paper also provides several recommendations for follow-up studies, which should ultimately lead to standardized assumptions and a revised framework for National Economic Development analyses considering the canal’s expansion.

40|$|Cartilage canals {{have been}} shown to contain {{discontinuous}} blood vessels that enable circulating bacteria to bind to cartilage matrix, leading to vascular occlusion and associated pathological changes in pigs and chickens. It is also inconsistently reported that cartilage canals are surrounded by a cellular or acellular wall that may influence whether bacterial binding can occur. It is not known whether equine cartilage canals contain discontinuous endothelium or are surrounded by a wall. This study aimed to examine whether there were discontinuities in the endothelium of cartilage <b>canal</b> <b>vessels,</b> and whether <b>canals</b> had a cellular or acellular wall, in the epiphyseal growth cartilage of foals. Epiphyseal growth cartilage from the proximal third of the medial trochlear ridge of the distal femur from six healthy foals that were 1, 24, 35, 47, 118 and 122 days old and of different breeds and sexes was examined by light microscopy (LM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunohistochemistry. The majority of patent cartilage <b>canals</b> contained blood <b>vessels</b> that were lined by a thin layer of continuous endothelium. Fenestrations were found in two locations in one venule in a patent cartilage canal located deep in the growth cartilage and close to the ossification front in the 118 -day-old foal. Chondrifying cartilage canals in all TEM-examined foals contained degenerated endothelial cells that were detached from the basement membrane, resulting in gap formation. Thirty-three percent of all canals were surrounded by a hypercellular rim that was interpreted as contribution of chondrocytes to growth cartilage. On LM, 69 % of all cartilage canals were surrounded by a ring of matrix that stained intensely eosinophilic and consisted of collagen fibres on TEM that were confirmed to be collagen type I by immunohistochemistry. In summary, two types of discontinuity were observed in the endothelium of equine epiphyseal cartilage canal vessels: fenestrations were observed in a patent cartilage canal in the 118 -day-old foal; and gaps were observed in chondrifying cartilage canals in all TEM-examined foals. Canals were not surrounded by any cellular wall, but a large proportion was surrounded by an acellular wall consisting of collagen type I. Bacterial binding can therefore probably occur in horses by mechanisms that are similar to those previously demonstrated in pigs and chickens...|$|R

40|$|The {{adductor}} canal is a conical or pyramid-shaped pathway {{that contains}} the femoral vessels, saphenous nerve and a varying amount of fibrous tissue. It is involved in adductor canal syndrome, a claudication syndrome involving young individuals. Our objective was to study modifications induced by aging on the connective tissue and to correlate them to the proposed pathophysiological mechanism. The bilateral adductor <b>canals</b> and femoral <b>vessels</b> of four adult and five fetal specimens were removed en bloc and analyzed. Sections 12 µm thick were obtained and the connective tissue studied with Sirius Red, Verhoeff, Weigert and Azo stains. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photomicrographs of the surfaces of each adductor canal were also analyzed. Findings were homogeneous inside each group. The connective tissue of the canal was continuous with the outer layer of the vessels in both groups. The pattern of concentric, thick collagen type I bundles in fetal specimens {{was replaced by a}} diffuse network of compact collagen bundles with several transversal fibers and an impressive content of collagen III fibers. Elastic fibers in adults were not concentrated in the thick bundles but dispersed in line with the transversal fiber system. A dynamic compression mechanism with or without an evident constricting fibrous band has been proposed previously for adductor canal syndrome, possibly involving the connective tissue inside the <b>canal.</b> The <b>vessels</b> may not slide freely during movement.
