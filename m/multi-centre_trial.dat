40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} blood loss at {{elective}} lower segment caesarean section with administration of oxytocin 5 IU bolus versus oxytocin 5 IU bolus and oxytocin 30 IU infusion {{and to establish}} whether a large <b>multi-centre</b> <b>trial</b> is feasible. STUDY DESIGN: Women booked for an elective caesarean section were recruited to a pilot randomised controlled trial and randomised to either oxytocin 5 IU bolus and placebo infusion or oxytocin 5 IU bolus and oxytocin 30 IU infusion. We wished to establish whether the study design was feasible and acceptable and to establish sample size estimates for a definitive <b>multi-centre</b> <b>trial.</b> The outcome measures were total estimated blood loss at caesarean section and in the immediate postpartum period {{and the need for}} an additional uterotonic agent. RESULTS: A total of 115 women were randomised and 110 were suitable for analysis (5 protocol violations). Despite strict exclusion criteria 84 % of the target population were considered eligible for study participation and of those approached only 15 % declined to participate and 11 % delivered prior to the planned date. The total mean estimated blood loss was lower in the oxytocin infusion arm compared to placebo (567 ml versus 624 ml) and fewer women had a major haemorrhage (> 1000 ml, 14 % versus 17 %) or required an additional uterotonic agent (5 % versus 11 %). A sample size of 1500 in each arm would be required to demonstrate a 3 % absolute reduction in major haemorrhage (from baseline 10 %) with > 80 % power. CONCLUSION: An additional oxytocin infusion at elective caesarean section may reduce blood loss and warrants evaluation in a large <b>multi-centre</b> <b>trial...</b>|$|E

40|$|Purpose <b>Multi-centre</b> <b>trials</b> are an {{important}} part of proving the efficacy of procedures, drugs and interventions. Imaging components in such trials are becoming increasingly common; however, without sufficient control measures the usefulness of these data can be compromised. This paper describes a framework for performing high-quality <b>multi-centre</b> <b>trials</b> with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), using a pan-European initiative to acquire a normal control dopamine transporter brain scan database as an example. Methods A framework to produce high-quality and consistent SPECT imaging data was based on three key areas: quality assurance, the imaging protocol and system characterisation. Quality assurance was important to ensure that the quality of the equipment and local techniques was good and consistently high; system characterisation helped understand and where possible match the performance of the systems involved, whereas the imaging protocol was designed to allow a degree of flexibility to best match the characteristics of each imaging device. Results A total of 24 cameras on 15 sites from 8 different manufacturers were evaluated for inclusion in our multi-centre initiative. All results matched the required level of specification and each had their performance characterised. Differences in performance were found between different system types and cameras of the same type. Imaging protocols for each site were modified to match their individual characteristics to produce comparable high-quality SPECT images. Conclusion A framework has been designed to produce high-quality data for multi-centre SPECT studies. This framework has been successfully applied to a pan-European initiative to acquire a healthy control dopamine transporter image databas...|$|R

30|$|A {{different}} approach {{is used by}} Joshi and colleagues [8] {{as part of the}} Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative project. The authors apply an additional scanner-specific smoothing kernel to data from each scanner in a <b>multi-centre</b> <b>trial</b> in order to smooth all images to a common resolution. While this method succeeds in reducing the variability between datasets by 15 % to 20 %, it again produces images smoothed to that of the lowest resolution scanner. Furthermore, the requirement to register the clinical dataset to smoothed versions of the digital Hoffman brain phantom to determine the appropriate smoothing kernel using a voxel-wise comparison, makes the method difficult to extend to whole body data.|$|E

40|$|Aim Contemporary {{radiotherapy}} {{clinical trials}} typically require complex three-dimensional (3 D) treatment planning. This produces {{large amounts of}} data relating technique and dose delivery for correlation with patient outcomes. Assessment {{of the quality of}} this information is required to ensure protocol compliance, to quantify the variation in treatments given to patients and to enhance the power of studies to determine correlates of patient outcomes. Materials and methods A software system (‘SWAN’) was developed to facilitate the objective analysis, quality-assurance and review of digital treatment planning data from <b>multi-centre</b> radiotherapy <b>trials.</b> The utility of this system was assessed {{on the basis of its}} functionality and our experience of its use in the context of <b>multi-centre</b> clinical <b>trials</b> and trials-support activities. Results The SWAN system has been shown to have the functionality required for use in several <b>multi-centre</b> <b>trials,</b> including automated review and archive processes. Approximately 800 treatment plans from over 30 participating institutions have so far been assessed with the system for several treatment planning scenarios. To illustrate this we include a description of the use of the system for a large-recruitment prostate radiotherapy trial being undertaken in Australasia, including examples of how the review process has changed clinical practice. Conclusion The successful implementation of SWAN has been demonstrated in a number of clinical trials. The software provides an opportunity for comprehensive review of treatment parameters that could impact on clinical outcomes and trial results. Such quality-assurance (QA) has previously been difficult or impossible to achieve, particularly for a clinical trial involving large numbers of patients. Such reviews have highlighted inconsistencies in clinical practice that have since been addressed through feedback from the review process. The process of data collection and review should be undertaken by dedicated, experienced and skilled staff in order to ensure efficiency...|$|R

Therefore, glutamine has been re-classified as an essential amino acid under such catabolic conditions. The role of glutamine supplementation in trauma patients has been extensively studies. Despite the numerous clinical trials that investigated the effect of enteral and parenteral glutamine supplementation in multiple trauma patients, the results are inconclusive.

40|$|Hip {{fractures}} are {{a significant}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} worldwide and the burden of disability associated with hip fractures globally vindicate the need for high-quality research to advance the care of patients with hip fractures. Historically, large, <b>multi-centre</b> randomized controlled <b>trials</b> have been rare in the orthopaedic trauma literature. Similar to other medical specialties, orthopaedic research is currently undergoing a paradigm shift from single centre initiatives to larger collaborative groups. This is evident with the establishment of several collaborative groups in Canada, in the United States, and in Europe, which has proven that <b>multi-centre</b> <b>trials</b> can be extremely successful in orthopaedic trauma research.
