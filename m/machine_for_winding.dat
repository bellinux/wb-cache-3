Because of time and space limitations this paper is limited to Cheney Brothers 2 ̆ 7 activities in New York City which are, but a fraction, of a much larger story. Brothers and beginnings Like many other enterprising Americans in the 1830 s, brothers Charles (1803 - 1874), Ward (1813 - 1876), Rush (1815 - 1882), and Frank (1817 - 1904), Cheney became engaged in the time consuming, difficul t business of raising silk worms until they discovered that speculation on the morus morticaulis, the white mulberry tree upon which the worms fed, might be far more profitable. As with all high profit operations the tree business was a high-risk venture, throwing many investors including the Cheney brothers, into bankruptcy. Failure however, was not part of Ch ney vocabulary. In 1838, with a friend from New York, Edwin H. Arnold, they built a water power mill on the Hop Brook in Manchester Connecticut with financing supplied by their successful artist brothers, Seth (1810 - 1856) and John Cheney (1801 - 1885). The Mt. Nebo Silk Manufacturing Company hired young women to unravel cocoons to produce silk sewing thread that Ward took to Philadelphia to sell under the name 2 ̆ 2 Fratelli Chinacci, 2 ̆ 2 since all fine sewing thread at that time came from Italy.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of {{high-temperature}} superconducting (HTS) materials, increasing attention is given to HTS machines, which have good application potentials in large wind turbine systems. In theory, HTS machines can be much more compact than conventional machines, {{by virtue of the}} large excitation current and high efficiency of the former, because the losses in the superconducting wires are virtually zero. In this paper, a novel 3 -MW HTS double-stator doubly fed synchronous <b>machine</b> is proposed <b>for</b> <b>wind</b> power generation. The key of the proposed generator is that the magnetic field produced by the dc superconducting field coils in the inner stator is modulated by the rotating iron poles, and the resultant field will finally interact with the magnetomotive force produced by the ac armature windings in the outer stator to produce a constant magnetic torque in the rotor. The main advantage of this doubly fed machine is that the superconducting field coils are stationary. Hence, the cryostat and the exciter are also stationary, which significantly simplifies the cooling and excitation systems. Due to the flexibly controllable excitation current, the generator can have a constant voltage output when the wind speed varies. The performance of the proposed machine is analyzed using the finite-element method. Department of Electrical Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{increase}} of wind {{power in the}} power grid results in high grid connection requirements <b>for</b> <b>wind</b> turbines. Moreover, the reliability of wind turbines {{becomes more and more}} important, especially in offshore applications. One potential solution for these demands is the wind turbine drive-train based on the brushless doubly-fed induction machine (DFIM). This machine type has no brushes or slip-rings on the rotor side which provides an attractive alternative to the DFIM which is commonly employed in the current market. However, the brushless DFIM has not yet been commercialized. Therefore, the primary objective of this thesis focuses on ‘modeling and design of brushless DFIM, to advance the development of this <b>machine</b> type <b>for</b> <b>wind</b> turbine applications’. A computationally efficient FE model is proposed to evaluate the performance of the brushless DFIM. An efficient, flexible and accurate optimization approach is then developed by combining the computationally efficient FE model with the NSGA-II multi-objective optimization algorithm. Compared with normal induction machines, the brushless DFIM is expected to have more severe noise, vibrations and lower power quality due to many undesired space-harmonics. The 2 D multi-slice FE model is applied to investigate whether skewing rotor slots is useful to overcome these drawbacks of brushless DFIMs. Based on the study of the space- and time-harmonics in brushless DFIMs, a computationally efficient method is proposed to investigate the effects of skew at the initial design stage. Sixteen constructions are evaluated to gain more design guidelines for nested-loop rotors. The complicated space- and time-harmonics, the influence of the rotor skew and the influence of the nested-loop configurations are studied and validated by carrying out measurements on a small-scale prototype with four different rotors. The 3 D magneto-static FE model is applied to investigate the axial flux due to the skewed slots which is neglected in the 2 D multi-slice FE model. Finally, all the modeling methods and the design guidelines are brought together to optimize the design of a 3. 2 MW brushless DFIM. The results show that the design is improved from the active material cost and the efficiency of the machine points of view by increasing the magnetic loading of the brushless DFIMs. However, the brushless DFIM does not show advantages compared with normal DFIGs and PM generators from the efficiency and the shear stress points of view. However, considering the additional advantages of maintenance and reliability, the brushless DFIMs may provide a feasible application <b>for</b> <b>wind</b> turbine drive-trains.
