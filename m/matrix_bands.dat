40|$|AIMS To use a {{sensitive}} forensic test to measure blood contamination of used Siqveland <b>matrix</b> <b>bands</b> following routine cleaning and sterilisation procedures in general dental practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen general dental {{practices in the}} West of Scotland participated. Details of instrument cleaning procedures were recorded for each practice. A total of 133 Siqveland <b>matrix</b> <b>bands</b> were recovered following cleaning and sterilisation and were examined for residual blood contamination by the Kastle-Meyer test, a well-recognised forensic technique. RESULTS: Ultrasonic baths {{were used for the}} cleaning of 62 (47 %) bands and retainers and the remainder (53 %) were hand scrubbed prior to autoclaving. Overall, 21 % of the <b>matrix</b> <b>bands</b> and 19 % of the retainers gave a positive Kastle-Meyer test, indicative of residual blood contamination, following cleaning and sterilisation. In relation to cleaning method, 34 % of hand-scrubbed bands and 32 % of hand-scrubbed retainers were positive for residual blood by the Kastle-Meyer test compared with 6 % and 3 % respectively of ultrasonically cleaned bands and retainers (P less than 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: If Siqveland <b>matrix</b> <b>bands</b> are re-processed in the assembled state, then adequate pre-sterilisation cleaning cannot be achieved reliably. Ultrasonic baths are significantly more effective than hand cleaning for these items of equipment...|$|E
40|$|Equal-Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) is {{a method}} used to {{introduce}} severe plastic deformation into a metallic billet without changing its geometry. In special cases, strain localization occurs and a pattern consisting of regions with high and low deformation (so-called shear and <b>matrix</b> <b>bands)</b> can emerge. This paper studies this phenomenon numerically adopting two-dimensional finite element simulations of one ECAP pass. The mechanical behavior of aluminum is modeled using phenomenological plasticity theory with isotropic or kinematic hardening. The effects of the two different strain hardening types are investigated numerically by systematic parameter studies: while isotropic hardening only causes minor fluctuations in the plastic strain fields, a material with high initial hardening rate and sufficient strain hardening capacity can exhibit pronounced localized deformation after ECAP. The corresponding finite element simulation results show a regular pattern of shear and <b>matrix</b> <b>bands.</b> This result is confirmed experimentally by ECAP-processing of AA 6060 material in a severely cold worked condition, where microstructural analysis also reveals the formation of shear and <b>matrix</b> <b>bands.</b> Excellent agreement is found between the experimental and numerical results in terms of shear and matrix band width and length scale.

40|$|In {{this study}} a crystal {{plasticity}} {{finite element model}} (CPFEM) has been developed to investigate texture evolution of copper single crystal during equal channel angular pressing (ECAP).

40|$|A crystal {{plasticity}} {{finite element}} method (CPFEM) model has been developed to investigate the texture evolution and heterogeneity during equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) of an aluminum single crystal. The developed model has been validated by comparison with experimental observations. The simulation {{results show that the}} lattices rotate predominantly around the Z axis (transverse direction) during ECAP. After deformation the billet is subdivided into three <b>matrix</b> <b>bands</b> along the thickness by the Z-axis rotation. The Z-axis rotation angles within three <b>matrix</b> <b>bands</b> are about 60 °, 0 ° and 90 °, respectively. It has been found that the die geometry plays a very important role on the texture evolution and heterogeneity in ECAP. In the large strain gradient region, multi-slip can be activated and the material rotation induced by slips is negligible. The lattices must rotate to accommodate the whole material rotation required by deformation. When the strain gradient is small, the single dominant slip is the main slip mechanism.

Methods 10 students and 10 experienced dentists each prepared 24 Class II cavity preparations in typodont teeth without protection, 10 utilising stainless steel <b>matrix</b> <b>bands</b> and 10 utilising protective wedges. The frequency and extent of damage were analysed with respect to the above variables. Subsequently, 20 natural and 20 typodont teeth were utilised to establish the relationship in depth of damage caused by a high-speed diamond bur on typodont versus natural teeth.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, a {{systematic}} {{study has been}} conducted aiming to attain an insight into the influence of rolling reduction on the deformation behaviour and crystallographic orientation development during cold rolling. Simulations were successfully carried out using a crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM) model with the highest reduction of 80 %. Aluminium single crystals with initial ideal Cube orientation ({ 0 0 1 }〈 1 0 0 〉) were selected {{in order to avoid}} the influence of grain boundaries. The results revealed the development of deformation <b>matrix</b> <b>bands</b> through the billet thickness, parallel to the rolling direction, which have been observed in the experiment in the literature. The sign of rotation angles in the neighbouring <b>matrix</b> <b>bands</b> are opposite with each other, even at the reduction of 80 %. The corresponding { 1 1 1 } pole figures offered direct evidence of the spread of crystallographic orientation around the transverse direction. It is clear from the current study that the rolling reduction significantly influences the deformation heterogeneity which leads to the inhomogeneous texture evolution, non-uniform distributions of macroscopic stress and strain in the cold rolled samples. The slip system activity has been examined in detail and the predicted results are consistent with the early reported experiments...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. While the biomechanical {{properties}} of bone are reasonably well understood at many levels of structural hierarchy, surprisingly {{little is known}} about the response of bone to loading at the ultrastructural and crystal lattice levels. In this study, our aim was to examine the response (i. e., rate of change of the vibra-tional frequency of mineral and <b>matrix</b> <b>bands</b> as a function of applied pressure) of murine cortical bone subjected to hydrostatic compression. We determined the relative response during loading and unloading of mineral vs. matrix, and within the mineral, phosphate vs. carbonate, as well as proteinated vs. deproteinated bone. For all mineral species, shifts to higher wave numbers were observed as pressure increased. However, the change in vibrational frequency with pressure for the more rigid carbonate was less than for phosphate, and caused primarily by movement of ions within the unit cell. Deformation of phosphate on the other hand, re-sults from both ionic movement as well as distortion. Changes in vibrational frequencies of organic species with pressure are greater than for mineral species, and are consistent with changes in protein secondary struc-tures such as alterations in interfibril cross-links and helix pitch. Changes in vibrational frequency with pressure are similar between loading and unloading, implying reversibility, as a result of the inability to permanently move water out of the lattice. The use of high pressure Raman microspectroscopy enables a dee-per understanding of the response of tissue to mechan-ical stress and demonstrates that individual mineral and matrix constituents respond differently to pressure...|$|E

Subjects (materials) and methods Instruments analysed were <b>matrix</b> <b>bands,</b> associated retaining clips, diamond {{and stainless steel}} burs, extraction forceps and hand scalers. Each instrument was visually assessed under magnification for residual debris. Residual protein was extracted by immersion in detergent and sonication. A collection of used but uncleaned instruments of each type (n = 177) was also analysed for adherent protein using ophthalaldehyde/N-acetylcysteine reagent. Main outcome measures Residual protein levels allowed comparisons {{to be made on}} the effectiveness of different cleaning processes. Results One thousand, three hundred and four instruments were analysed. Observational data demonstrated several shortcomings in cleaning chemistries and operation of the AWD. For uncleaned instruments, median residual protein levels ranged from 0. 4 mu g (stainless steel burs) to 462 mu g (extraction forceps). Following manual washing, median protein levels ranged from 0. 3 - 78 mu g; for manual plus ultrasonic washing, levels ranged from 9 - 39 mu g and AWD levels ranged from 0. 3 - 27 mu g. Manual washing combined with ultrasonic cleaning was significantly less effective than the other two processes (p < 0. 008). AWDs reduced the variability in the cleaning process.

The calculated absorptions are all on the red wing of the observed <b>matrix</b> <b>bands</b> and from these favorable comparisons, substitutional site occupancy is identified for ground state atomic mercury.

The energetics of waist and body vibronic modes, involving motion of the lattice atoms with respect to the excited state mercury atom and motion of this atom in the solid, respectively, were calculated for the three symmetry poles of the cubo-octahedral substitutional sites. Excited state stabilization was found for the waist mode of all the Hg/RG systems in the three possible coordinate systems, i. e., based on the fourfold, threefold, and twofold symmetry systems. In contrast, the body modes were stabilized only in Hg/Xe. The difference between Hg/Xe and the other Hg/RG systems is related to the larger substitutional site size presented by the former system. The three components identified in the recorded emission bands are correlated with the existence of several vibronic modes leading to stabilization. Emission energies calculated for the three stabilized vibronic modes in Ar are centered on the observed emission but exhibit a larger splitting. In Kr they are red of the observed band maximum but occur within the observed band. A curve crossing mechanism is identified which can explain the lack of emission for the strongly stabilized, fourfold symmetry modes in Hg/Xe...|$|E
40|$|Advances of {{composite}} {{systems and}} their application have revolutionised {{the management of}} posterior teeth affected by caries, facilitating a minimally invasive approach. Previous surveys have indicated that the teaching of posterior composites within dental schools was developing, albeit not keeping pace with clinical evidence {{and the development of}} increasingly predictable techniques and materials. Concurrently, surveys of dental practice indicate that dental amalgam still predominates as the 'material of choice' for the restoration of posterior teeth within UK general dental practice. In light of such considerations, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate current teaching of posterior composites in Irish and UK dental schools. An online questionnaire which sought information in relation to the current teaching of posterior composites was developed and distributed to the 17 established Irish and UK dental schools with undergraduate teaching programmes in late 2009. Results: Completed responses were received from all 17 schools (response rate = 100 %). All 17 schools taught the placement of occlusal and two-surface occlusoproximal composites in premolar and permanent molar teeth. Two schools did not teach placement of three-surface occlusoproximal composites in either premolars or molars. In their preclinical courses, ten schools taught posterior composites before teaching dental amalgams. Fifty-five percent of posterior restorations placed by dental students were of composite (range = 10 - 90 %) and 44 % amalgam (range = 10 - 90 %), indicating an increase of 180 % in the numbers of posterior composites placed over the past five years. Diversity was noted in the teaching of clinical techniques and students at different schools are trained with different composites and bonding systems. Some cause for concern was noted in the teaching of certain techniques that were not in keeping with existing best evidence, such as the teaching of transparent <b>matrix</b> <b>bands</b> and light-transmitting wedges for occluso-proximal composites (eight schools) and the teaching of bevels on the cavosurface enamel margins of both the occlusal and proximal box margins (three schools). The teaching of posterior composites in the Irish and UK dental schools has substantially increased over the last five years. Dental students in these schools often gain more experience in the placement of posterior composites than amalgam. However, practice trends indicate that a majority of GDPs continue to place amalgam in preference to composite, thereby suggesting a source of tension as current dental students emerge into the dental workforce over the coming years. There is, as a consequence, a challenge to the dental profession and its funding agencies in the UK to encourage more of a shift towards the minimally interventive use of composite systems in the restoration of posterior teeth, in particular among established practitioners...|$|E

In the Alps, PSTs in the crust are mostly recognized along major faults, i. e., at the base of allochtonous units and along the Periadriatic Lineament fault system. Here we describe fault- and injection-PSTs associated to exhumed faults and shear zones in the Ulten zone, in the NE sector of the Austroalpine Tonale nappe (NE Italy). In this area, at the intersection between three main fault systems, i. e., the Peio, Tonale and Giudicarie, PSTs are extensively present (Figure 1). Figure 1 : Simplified structural map of the Tonale nappe, with distribution of pseudotachylytes in basement rocks. Faults and minor shear zones are inferred from ductile and brittle data from field observations and previous studies. The area where pseudotachylytes are more abundant (shaded area) is part of the Ulten zone. In the field, PSTs are commonly associated to (ultra) mylonites and cataclasites, within felsic migmatites and gneiss of the Ulten unit. New collected structural data confirm the presence of a complex system of faults (i. e., Rumo, Val dell’Acqua, Passo Palù and Val Clapa; Figure 1) with the presence of both ductile and brittle indicators of deformation (cf. Martin et al., 2004). Fault-veins show typical thickness between few millimeters to 1 – 2 cm, with variable lengths up to 3 – 5 m. Injection-veins can attain 7 – 10 cm in thickness and few tens of centimeters in length. Veins are banded, with sharp boundaries between different bands and sheat-fold-like structures, or with an homogeneous <b>matrix.</b> <b>Bands</b> exhibit chemical component variations in some elements, for example K 20. Clasts within the glassy matrix are mostly quartz with minor plagioclase and rare sillimanite, kyanite, apatite and K-feldspar. Plagioclase clasts show rims with evident cathodoluminescence, inversely correlated to the size of clasts. Microlite layers are generally parallel to the vein walls, sometimes forming coronas around clasts. Data and results Petrology A mass-balance study, performed to quantify the partial melting process, shows that clasts are mainly composed of quartz, plagioclase, sillimanite (or kyanite), suggesting that biotite, muscovite and garnet have almost completely melted. The proportion of the melted rock is on the order of 0. 6. A thermodynamic modelling of the melting process shows that the energy necessary to melt 1 cm 3 of rock is in the order of 4 – 5 kJ. Temperature reached inhomogeneous values up to ~ 1700 °C for quartz clasts, with an average temperature in the 1200 – 1400 °C range for the PST melt before quenching. Geochronology 40 Ar- 39 Ar in-situ ages vary across the veins, due to relevant variations of K/Cl ratios and, in some extent, to the 40 Ar yield. Older ages are justified by the presence of clasts. The ages of four veins, supported by in-situ and step-heating analyses, are comprised between about 35 and 21 Ma, with a sample with an older age of ~ 50 Ma. Tectonic implications The dated PSTs, also compared with other results from the literature, confirm a peak of deformation of the NE sector of Tonale nappe (Ulten unit) during the Late Eocene-Early Oligocene. This tectonic event was contemporaneous with the major magmatic pulse along the Periadriatic Lineament. Most of the pseudotachylytes developed under metamorphic conditions at temperatures compatible with low-T mylonite generation and with closure temperature of zircons (minimum P-T conditions from Godard et al., 1996; 0. 4 – 0. 5 GPa, 450 – 500 °C). A late activity of the North Giudicarie fault is confirmed by zircon fission tracks of Early Miocene age and coeval pseudotachylytes (~ 21 Ma).

However, the effect of LTP on dental structures is not clear. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of LTP on enamel and dentin substrates. Therefore, we analyzed Knoop microhardness to calculate the percentage of surface hardness (SH), changes in contact angles (CA), the surface topography by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and also the chemical composition by Raman spectrometry (RS). Initially, 4 x 4 x 2 mm enamel and dentin blocks were prepared from bovine incisors. All blocks were polished and divided into three groups (n = 6); argon plasma, argon flow rate and control. The SH was assessed before and after each treatment, performing five penetrations in each specimen (50 g / 25 g and 5 s enamel / dentin 5 s). Contact angles changes were performed by dispersing water drop on the treated surfaces and observing the contact angle obtained after 1 min and 1 hour. For that, high-resolution digital photos and the Image J program was used. Physical changes in the structure of enamel and dentin submitted to LTP were observed from the SEM. Additionally, the relative proportion of the organic and mineral content of the enamel and dentin after treatment were analyzed by RS. Data were evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) - 2 -way (treatment and time) and Tukey test (&# 945; < 0. 05). For the SH the results showed no significant difference in the enamel (p= 0. 087), however, the SH of dentin decreased after treatment with argon plasma (p= 0. 005). The results indicated that water contact angle values in enamel decreased after 1 min of the application of argon plasma (p< 0. 05). In the dentin the contact angle decreased after 1 and 60 min of the application of argon plasma (p< 0. 05). The RS results showed than argon plasma and argon gas presented lower organic <b>matrix</b> <b>bands,</b> similar results were observated for both enamel and dentin. The SEM showed that in addition to removing the external smear layer to the dentinal tubules, treatment with LTP promoted cracks in the enamel and the dentin surfaces. In conclusion, the use of argon plasma decreased the superficial hardness in dentin and, potentially increased the wetting in booth substract. Superficial morphological change and decreased of the organic matrix were observed in booth estructures after treatment with argon plasma and argon flow rate. O plasma de baixa temperatura (PBT) tem tido seu uso investigado na destruiÃÃo dos biofilmes orais, no entanto, seu efeito sobre os substratos dentÃrios ainda nÃo estÃ completamente esclarecido. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o efeito do PBT na dureza superficial, no Ãngulo de contato, na morfologia das superfÃcies e composiÃÃo quÃmica do esmalte e dentina bovinos. Para tanto, foram analisados a dureza de superfÃcie Knoop (DS), as alteraÃÃes nos Ãngulos de contato (AC), a morfologia de superfÃcie por Microscopia EletrÃnica de Varredura (MEV) e sua composiÃÃo quÃmica atravÃs da Espectofotometria Raman (ER). Inicialmente, foram confeccionados blocos de esmalte e dentina com dimensÃes de 4 x 4 x 2 mm preparados a partir de dentes bovinos. Todos os blocos foram polidos e dividos em trÃs grupos (n= 6) : Plasma de ArgÃnio, GÃs de ArgÃnio e Controle. A DS foi avaliada antes e depois de cada tratamento, realizando-se cinco penetraÃÃes em cada espÃcime (50 g/ 5 s para esmalte e 25 g/ 5 s para dentina). A determinaÃÃo do AC foi realizada dispersando uma gota de Ãgua sobre a superfÃcie tratada e observando o Ãngulo de contato obtido em 1 min e 1 hora, utilizando fotografias digitais de alta resoluÃÃo e o programa Image J. As alteraÃÃes fÃsicas na morfologia do esmalte e dentina submetidos ao PBT foram observadas a partir da MEV. Adicionalmente, a proporÃÃo relativa do conteÃdo orgÃnico e mineral do esmalte e dentina apÃs os tratamentos foram analisados por ER. Os dados foram avaliados por anÃlise de variÃncia (ANOVA) â 1 via para DS e 2 vias (tratamento e tempo) para AC, apÃs Tukey teste (&# 945; < 0, 05). Os resultados da DS demostraram nÃo haver diferenÃa significativa no esmalte (p = 0, 087) apÃs os tratamentos. No entanto, a MS da dentina diminuiu apÃs o tratamento de plasma de argÃnio (p = 0, 005). Os resultados indicaram que os valores de Ãngulo de contato da Ãgua diminuÃram apÃs 1 minuto da aplicaÃÃo de plasma de argÃnio no esmalte (p < 0, 05) e apÃs 1 minuto e 60 minutos da aplicaÃÃo de plasma de argÃnio na dentina (p < 0, 05). Os resultados da ER demonstraram que os tratamentos com o plasma de argÃnio e gÃs de argÃnio apresentaram menores intensidades nas bandas da matriz orgÃnica para o esmalte e para a dentina. Em adiÃÃo, a MEV demonstrou que, alÃm de remover a smear layer externa aos tÃbulos dentinÃrios, o tratamento com PBT promoveu rachaduras na superfÃcie do esmalte e da dentina. Em conclusÃo, o PBT diminuiu a dureza superficial da dentina e melhorou potencialmente o molhamento da superfÃcie do esmalte e dentina. AlteraÃÃes morfolÃgicas superficiais e diminuiÃÃo da matrix orgÃnica foram observadas para ambas as estruturas dentais, depois dos tratamentos com plasma de argÃnio e gÃs de argÃnio...|$|E
40|$|Carbon dioxide {{capture and}} storage in deep {{geological}} formations {{is proving to}} be a very promising method for sequestering anthropogenic CO 2 emissions and isolating them from the earth’s atmosphere. The global CO 2 storage capacity of saline aquifers is much greater than the other options and it is possible to find nearby major sources of CO 2. The suitability of a potential geological storage site should be investigated carefully by taking into account a number of geochemical and geomechanical factors. Of these factors, it is important to analyse the effects of the induced changes in pressure and stresses caused by CO 2 injection on the behaviour of the rock mass, especially the caprock and any major traversing low permeability geological structures. The geochemical immaturity of the reservoirs is also important. This study aims to develop a better understanding of aspects of the failure of caprock during and after the sequestration of carbon dioxide into geological formations deep below the surface. This project examines the various factors and processes affecting the geomechanics of rocks, since CO 2 storage integrity may be seriously jeopardized by the fracturing or reopening of a pre-existing non-transmissive fault in the reservoir or caprock formation. In the present study, a comprehensive literature review of the geomechanical and geochemical processes involved in the carbon geo-sequestration was conducted which highlights relevant processes in conjunction with theories related to the mechanical and flow behaviour of formation rocks. The effects of pore fluid properties on the characteristics of reservoir rocks are also important when studying CO 2 sequestration in saline formations and are investigated in this study using two types of locally-available sandstone specimens. The investigation also focuses on the experimental and numerical analysis of the flow and mechanical behaviour of the reservoirs and caprocks and their response to the injection of CO 2. This is achieved by the investigation of the fluid flow-related properties of intact and fractured rock specimens obtained from the Otway Basin Pilot Project (OBPP) in Victoria, Australia. The main objectives of this study are as follows: • Development of a comprehensive literature review and a novel laboratory set-up for the testing of rock specimens close to realistic sequestration reservoir conditions. • A laboratory investigation and analysis of reservoir and caprock specimens to assess their hydromechanical characteristics. These tests are intended to be carried out at the pressure and temperature conditions which are expected to occur in the reservoir chosen for sequestration project. • Studying the effects fractures on the flow characteristics of rock specimens. • Development of exclusive models to understand, extrapolate and reproduce the intact and fracture flow behaviour of rocks as identified from the laboratory results. The development of a parametric reservoir-scale model to demonstrate the safety and efficiency of saline aquifers and support their suitability as promising CO 2 storage reservoirs is also attempted. • Investigating the effects of geomechanical and geochemical interaction between rock minerals, brine and dissolved CO 2 on the rock properties and the overall mechanical properties of reservoir rocks. • Analysing the deformation behaviour of reservoir and caprock specimens using the Acoustic Emission (AE) and visual surface strain measurement systems (ARAMIS). An elaborate high pressure and temperature-controlled laboratory apparatus was developed for the experimental investigation of rock specimens. This test set-up and the data acquisition system were developed in-house and were calibrated prior to the commencement of the test series. The set-up is presented and explained in detail in Chapter 3. The chapter also explains the methodology developed for the preparation, installation and testing of the rock specimens. Two locally-available types of sandstones (S and M-type) were used {{for the study of the}} effects of brine and CO 2 -rich brine saturation on the mechanical properties of reservoir rocks. Brine saturation at different values of NaCl concentration is found to cause a significant difference in the sandstone properties. Uniaxial compressive testing of the CO 2 -rich brine-saturated sandstone specimens revealed that sandstones cores with high clay content allow the dissolved CO 2 and brine to chemically interact with the clay minerals and exhibit noticeable changes to their mechanical properties. These results will aid better understanding of the geomechanical response of saline formations with different types of reservoir rock materials and salinities to CO 2 injection and dissolution. Visual and acoustic emission strain measurement systems were also used in addition to strain gauges; in order to carefully study the deformation-related engineering properties of the specimens under different brine saturations. Reservoir integrity is a critical factor for the long-term safe storage of CO 2 in geological formations. Therefore, this study involved the hydromechanical testing of rock specimens from the OBPP reservoir and caprock layers. The triaxial and uniaxial testing set-ups and the acoustic emission measurement system explained in Chapter 3 were used for the extensive experimental study of the mechanical and flow-related properties of the rock specimens under brine and CO 2 injection, and the results are reported in Chapter 5. The sandstone specimens from the reservoir region of the OBPP system possess very high porosity and permeability while they were also found to be physically and petrologically highly heterogeneous as thin layers of black coal and clay (mostly parallel to the stereographic alignment) were discovered in the core specimens. At the same time the specimens exhibit small weak <b>matrix</b> <b>bands</b> which can fail under axial compression resulting in the formation of compaction bands. Experimental results of triaxial testing of intact and fractured reservoir specimens reveal that these compaction bands can greatly affect the permeability of these sandstone specimens. On reservoir scale this may lead to compartmentalization of the storage reservoir, significantly hampering the overall storage capacity and integrity of the geological formation. Numerical models for different types of rock failure under triaxial stresses and their impact on the fluid flow properties of the rock specimens were developed using COMSOL Multiphysics (a FEM analytical software tool). These models also validate the triaxial experimental results by reproducing the observations of fluid flow similar to those recorded in the laboratory investigation. A reservoir-scale model was also developed to simulate the processes that take place in a saline aquifer CO 2 storage system. The hypothetical reservoir model was investigated for a total period of 100 years (including 30 years of injection phase and 70 years of CO 2 storage) in intact state. The laboratory scale models successfully determine the compaction-related hydromechanical characteristics of the reservoir rocks and the reservoir-scale model demonstrates long term safety of CO 2 storage in an ideal, but hypothetical reservoir system...|$|E
