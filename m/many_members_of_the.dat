5|$|An {{inventory}} {{drawn up}} at the Hôtel de la Reine after Catherine's death shows her {{to have been a}} keen collector. Listed works of art included tapestries, hand-drawn maps, sculptures, rich fabrics, ebony furniture inlaid with ivory, sets of china, and Limoges pottery. There were also hundreds of portraits, for which a vogue had developed during Catherine's lifetime. Many portraits in her collection were by Jean Clouet (1480–1541) and his son François Clouet (1572). François Clouet drew and painted portraits of all Catherine's family and of <b>many</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court. After Catherine's death, a decline in the quality of French portraiture set in. By 1610, the school patronised by the late Valois court and brought to its pinnacle by François Clouet had all but died out.|$|E

5|$|During the 1920s, Victoria had repressive and {{restrictive}} drinking laws, {{including the}} notorious six o'clock closing.

Almost as controversially, Blamey drew a sharp distinction between his personal life and his job. His presence in a hotel after closing time was always welcome, as it meant that drinking could continue, for it was known {{that it would not be}} raided while he was there; but other citizens felt that it was unjust when they were arrested for breaking the same laws.|$|E
