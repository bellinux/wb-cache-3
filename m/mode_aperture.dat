Full metering functionality is maintained however, as are some automated shooting <b>modes</b> (<b>aperture</b> priority). A further disadvantage with some LM and LTM lenses is that lenses with significant rear protrusions {{simply do not}} fit inside the camera body and risk damaging lens or body.

The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method can be used to model complex geometries and guide the design of different types of applicators. In the reported research, the FDTD approach has been employed to characterize the electric field distribution of a rectangular waveguide applicator, carrying TE 10 <b>mode</b> <b>aperture</b> field distribution, terminated in an oversize rectangular waveguide / cavity and operating at 915 MHz. A comprehensive study was carried out to evaluate the mode/field distribution in the empty cavity box as a function of its geometrical dimensions. Power deposition profile throughout the volume of a packaged food, and scattering parameters as a function of food properties and surrounding environment were computed, by using a realistic food-engineering model.

40|$|An {{atypical}} planktic foraminifer having close resemblance with Orbulinoides Blow & Saito, 1968 {{is recorded}} from a lignite mine section in Kutch, western India. It is practically indistinguishable from Orbulinoides under optical microscope due to general similarities in chamber morphology, coiling <b>mode,</b> <b>aperture</b> number and character, but differs in wall texture when observed under {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM). The wall is characterized by pores of variable size and irregularly distributed pustules unlike the spinose wall of normal Orbulinoides. Based on the SEM micrographs some specialist opinion suggested that the taxon might be a benthic foraminifer. The morphological features of the studied foraminifera are, however, distinctly different from benthic foraminifera with a planktic stage. The associated larger benthic foraminifera correlate the section with the carbonates of Middle Eocene (Bartonian) age in the adjoining areas of Kutch. The accompanying foraminiferal assemblage suggests a near-shore, brackish-water, semi-enclosed depositional environment. It is suggested that the aberrant wall texture was possibly due to environmental stress developed in the restricted basin. Due to incongruous wall texture and to its occurrence as the only planktic foraminifera in the section, the nomenclature of the reported foraminifera is kept open...|$|E

40|$|Excellent {{sensitivity}} and accuracy {{in the measurement}} of deformation occurring in materials tests have been achieved with a newly developed microwave frequency sensor and instrumentation system with possible application for strain tests inside nuclear reactors. The strain sensor comprises a microwave cavity resonating in the circular TE 113 and TM 110 modes. Detection of axial strain occurs due to the changes of resonant frequency incurred by cavity length changes. Axial strain sensitivity for the TE 113 mode was 6 x 10 $sup - 6 $ per MHz, whereas radial dimensions of the cavity were related to frequency of the TM 110 <b>mode.</b> <b>Aperture</b> coupling of the cavity to the end wall of K/sub a/ band waveguide provided signal excitation of the two monitored modes. Phase locked frequency stability enabled digital count/display of resonant frequencies to within 70 kHz at 35 GHz. Room temperature tension test results demonstrate a strain measuring sensitivity (+- 1 x 10 $sup - 6 $) and accuracy (+ - 1 percent of the measured value) equivalent to those of electrical resistance strain gages. The system yields accurate measurements of elastic strains as well as small departures from elastic response and hysteresis behavior during unloading and reloading. Creep test results confirm that measurement {{sensitivity and}} accuracy are retained in elevated temperature tests. Strain response on loading, subsequent creep deformation and creep recovery after unloading can all be measured in detail. Stability of microwave sensor calibration after exposure for 22 x 10 $sup 6 $ seconds at temperatures from 728 $sup 0 $K to 866 $sup 0 $K is shown to be excellent...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from SPIE via the DOI in this record. The Planet Formation Imager (PFI) is a project for a very large optical interferometer intended to obtain images of the planet formation process at scales as small as the Hill sphere of giant exoplanets. Its main science instruments will work in the thermal infrared {{but it will be}} cophased in the near infrared, where it requires also some capacity for scientific imaging. PFI imaging and resolution specifications imply an array of 12 to 20 apertures and baselines up to a few kilometers cophased at near infrared coherent magnitudes as large as 10. This paper discusses various cophasing architectures and the corresponding minimum diameter of individual apertures, which is the dominant element of PFI cost estimates. From a global analysis of the possible combinations of pairwise fringe sensors, we show that conventional approaches used in current interferometers imply the use of prohibitively large telescopes and we indicate the innovative strategies that would allow building PFI with affordable apertures smaller than 2 m in diameter. The approach with the best potential appears to be Hierarchical Fringe Tracking based on "two beams spatial filters" that cophase pairs of neighboring telescopes with all the efficiency of a two telescopes fringe tracker and transmit most of the flux as if it was produced by an unique single <b>mode</b> <b>aperture</b> to cophase pairs of pairs and then pairs of groups of apertures. We consider also the adaptation to PFI of more conventional approaches such as a combination of GRAVITY like fringe trackers or single or multiple chains of 2 T fringe trackers...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{simulated}} self- and mutual- acoustic impedances of guided <b>modes</b> at the <b>aperture</b> and estimated {{accuracy of the}} piston radiation approximation.

This kind of guided-wave technique can be utilized to solve problems in diverse fields of wave science such as acoustics, electromagnetism and optics. For acoustic waves emitted through a horn or a waveguide with an aperture {{much smaller than the}} wavelength, there are only plane wave modes in the waveguide and the aperture of horn can therefore be considered as a piston radiator. However if an acoustic wave with high frequency such as ultrasonic wave is radiated, there can exist several guided modes in the duct.

40|$|The {{behaviors}} of lateral propagating <b>modes</b> in the <b>aperture</b> and the oxidized regions are investigated numerically for selectively oxidized vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs).

So the coupling between the <b>modes</b> in the <b>aperture</b> and oxidized regions is very weak, and we can expect that the lateral spontaneous emission is greatly affected in this case. Ignoring the contribution of the lateral spontaneous emission, we calculate spontaneous emission factor by counting the total number of the guided modes in selectively oxidized VCSELs with double oxide layers.
