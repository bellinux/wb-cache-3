5|$|Blake Harrison {{conceived}} {{of the idea}} that would become Flocabulary while in high school. Inspired by hip hop artists like Outkast and A Tribe Called Quest, Harrison wanted to combine the easy retainability of hip hop lyrics with educational content. Harrison graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in English. He then <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco,</b> where he met Alex Rappaport, a music graduate of Tufts University. Harrison shared his idea with Rappaport, and in 2004 the two made a demo recording of two songs with a combined total of 80 SAT words. Within two months Sparknotes made the songs available for free streaming, and soon afterward Harrison and Rappaport set up a Flocabulary website. Cider Mill Press published Flocabulary books and distributed them through Sterling Publishing to sell the book at Barnes & Noble and Borders stores. The Hip Hop Approach to SAT Vocabulary sold 10,000 copies in its first year of publication and was reprinted five times. In 2005, Flocabulary went on a promotional tour of concerts at schools.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the 1850s {{during the}} California Gold Rush, {{the city of}} Sacramento rapidly grew around the {{confluence}} of the Sacramento River and its tributary the American River, near the middle of the Central Valley of California. The city's increasing population necessitated the construction of an extensive system of levees on the two rivers to prevent flooding. These early flood control works were insufficient; in 1862, the city was inundated so completely that the state government was temporarily <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco.</b> In 1956, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built the Folsom Dam at {{the confluence of the}} North and South Forks of the American River to provide flood control for the Sacramento metropolitan area. However, the Folsom Dam with a capacity of just 1 million acre feet (1.2 km3) compared to the annual American River flow of 2.7 million acre feet (3.3 km3) proved inadequate. A flood in 1955 filled the Folsom Reservoir to capacity, before the dam was even completed; it has also overflowed many times since.|$|E
