During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet. I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country's economic growth and environmental protection, improvements in our educational system.|$|E

On February 8, 2016, Warner/Chappell agreed to pay a settlement of $14 million {{to those who had}} licensed the song, and would allow a final judgment declaring the song to be in the public domain, with a final hearing scheduled in March 2016.

25|$|It is {{time for}} a new beginning.

I was appointed to my first public position as a college freshman and leave my second elected office as a proud father of three little girls. I am stepping down today from the State Assembly to turn greater attention to them and my law practice and to fulfilling other personal and professional aspirations. I will remain an active and vocal voice for better schools, a cleaner environment and lower taxes.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} {{published in the}} alternative weekly Montreal Mirror on June 8, Day addressed some of the perceptions that he was homophobic. He began by denying that he had ever referred to homosexuality as a [...] "mental disorder". He acknowledged having gay staffers working on his campaign: [...] "First of all, as far as <b>my</b> <b>campaign,</b> I don't ask people if they're homosexual, lesbian or heterosexual. People who are working on <b>my</b> <b>campaign</b> are doing so because they believe in me. That doesn't mean that they necessarily agree 100 per cent with everything I believe. But in principle they're saying we think you can take this Alliance {{to the next step}} and we think you'd be good for Canada. So I don't ask. Nobody has to pass a sex test to be on this campaign." [...] But the statement that made headlines in newspapers across the country was Day's acknowledgment that he would indeed consider using the Notwithstanding Clause to block a Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, then a distinct possibility that was unnerving many social conservatives. After being pressed by journalist Matthew Hays on the Notwithstanding Clause question, Day replied [...] "Yes, and the reason I say that is because such a significant number of constituents would reflect concern on that and would want the discussion. The Alberta position on this is that the definition of marriage changing would allow {{for the use of the}} Notwithstanding Clause. That's because the sense of the elected officials in Alberta is that the people would be significantly motivated on that issue." ...|$|E

[...] West's email, which he copied to members of House Democratic and Republican leadership, characterized Wasserman as [...] "the most vile, unprofessional, and despicable member of the US House of Representatives", said that she was [...] "not a lady" [...] and asked that she focus, instead, on her own congressional district.

2500|$|After his nomination, Jackson {{received}} backlash {{for some}} of his past statements that have been perceived as derogatory to gays, blacks, and Democrats. Jackson and some observers have noted the challenge of differentiating between statements made in a ministry setting and those made in a political setting. Jackson said, [...] "I {{have been forced to}} clarify those views because they went back and picked out ministry settings where I talked about these things and brought them into <b>my</b> <b>campaign.</b> Then I feel like I {{have no choice but to}} clarify." [...] Coby Dillard, a Norfolk Republican, observed that some of the criticism stems from the fact that commentary acceptable in a church setting is received differently in a political campaign. Jackson said that by critiquing his comments made in a ministry context, his opponents were trying to impose a religious test to say that anyone who takes a traditional view of the Bible is unfit for public office.|$|E

This campaign totally undermines what The Sex Pistols stood for. It is certainly not my personal plan or aim. I am proud of what The Sex Pistols achieved and always will be but this campaign totally undermines what The Sex Pistols stood for.
