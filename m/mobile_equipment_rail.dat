40|$|Studies {{conducted}} on surface coal mining equipment have identified whole-body vibration {{as a significant}} hazard. Operators of underground <b>mobile</b> <b>equipment,</b> particularly shuttle cars and transport vehicles, {{are also likely to}} be exposed to significant levels of whole-body vibration. To date, measuring whole-body vibration from underground mining <b>mobile</b> <b>equipment</b> has been difficult due to the guidelines governing the use of electrical equipment in underground mines. This paper presents data obtained from three low-methane coal mines using an iOS application installed on multiple iPod Touch devices. The majority of measurements taken from a range of <b>mobile</b> plant and <b>equipment</b> in use at the underground coal mines exceeded the ISO 2631. 1 Health Guidance Caution Zone (HGCZ). Further investigations are being undertaken to develop a thorough understanding of whole-body vibration exposures to which operators of <b>mobile</b> <b>equipment</b> used in underground coal mines are exposed and the opportunities for application of this information to assist mine site safety, health and risk management processes...|$|R
