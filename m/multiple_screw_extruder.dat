40|$|Mixing {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{functions}} of <b>screw</b> <b>extruders.</b> Mixing is usually divided in distributive and dispersive mixing.

The Center for Advanced Manufacturing at the Potchefstroom {{campus of}} the North West University aims to develop a twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> that is able to process powder coating resin. The {{facility}} has thus far produced various components and sub systems for local and international manufacturers of extrusion products. The research presented in this thesis aims to both develop a twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> with an integrated cooling roller system and to investigate {{of the performance of}} a twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder.</b> The development of a twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> consists of the selection of the drive section of the extruder, the complete design of a twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> gearbox, the investigation and design of a suitable barrel for the manufacturing of powder coatings as well as the development of a unique cooling roller unit for the forming of the processed product when exiting the extruder. The extruder was manufactured from the designed components and systems. It was found on further testing that it was capable of producing a powder coating resin of good quality. In order to evaluate the performance of an extruder, the transfer of energy through the extruder needs to be understood. Furthermore it is necessary to understand the theory behind each type of energy being consumed by the extruder, as well as the factors influencing the usage of that energy. The theories investigated were verified in practice by measuring the energy consumption of a twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> operated under various conditions. These tests provided a correlation between the consumption of mechanical and electrical energy. The results gave an indication of the effectiveness of the screw configuration of the processing section of the extruder, making it possible to determine how the configuration should be amended in order to improve the performance of the extruder. The two aims of the thesis were satisfactory completed. The developed twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> is able to manufacture powder coatings of good quality and the performance evaluation of a twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> was also successfully completed.

40|$|Although {{more and}} more twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruders</b> are {{being used in the}} polymer industry, the {{theoretical}} background is relatively undeveloped. The literature abounds in contradictions and often informs the reader that all extrusion problems can be solved if a certain new design is considered. The development of successful machines has mainly been possible through the application of commercially valuable empirical knowledge. In this research some understanding has been gained of the relevant phenomena that control the working of a counter-rotating intermeshing twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder.</b> In these machines the two screws form more or less C shaped chambers with leakage gaps between them. The basis of the model presented in this thesis is that the extruder can be regarded as two series of chambers moved from hopper to die by the rotation of screws, while the leakage flows provide interactions between these chambers. The throughput of a twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> can be calculated with this model by subtracting the total amount of leakage from the total volume of the C shaped chambers that come free per unit time. This has been checked with model extruders fully filled with Newtonian liquids giving completely satisfactory results. For these conditions the throughput to pressure relationship, presented in terms of two new dimensionless groups, Q/ 2 NmV and AP/Nn, can be represented by a straight line independent of viscosity and rotational speed. In order to obtain insight into the importance of the geometrical variables for the throughput to pressure relationship a sensitivity analysis has been made using computer programs based on the calculations of the leakage gaps. When using the two dimensionless numbers the characteristics are retained when the extruder is scaled up geometrically. Many quantitative articles report that twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruders</b> provide a better homogenisation on micro scale {{and that there is a}} narrower spread in residence time distributions than in single <b>screw</b> <b>extruders.</b> The experiments described in this thesis show that the dimensionless exit age distribution of a twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> can be worse than that of single <b>screw</b> <b>extruders.</b> Video recordings of tracer injections in a perspex model extruder have shown that the mixing within the chambers is also generally overestimated. The last two chapters deal with the extrusion of real polymers. The model as proposed in the first part of the thesis is extrapolated to practical situations. An explanation of the relative insensitivity of the throughput to the die pressure in a twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> when working with polymer granules is given. Experiments in which a real twin <b>screw</b> polymer <b>extruder</b> was stopped and dismantled confirm the predictions of the model that the length over which the extruder is fully filled with melt changes with die pressure. Finally it is shown quantitatively that the melting process in an intermeshing counter rotating twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> is markedly different from that in a single <b>screw</b> <b>extruder.</b> Aerodynamics & Wind EnergyApplied Science...|$|R

40|$|A {{coextruded}} snack {{based on}} corn, defatted soya flour and Indonesian ingredients (rice and/or tapioca) {{was developed for}} Indonesian consumers, particularly {{to fit into the}} young adult niche market. Market and consumer research was carried out through collecting primary and secondary data and the results were utilized in the formulation of the extruded snack. Information about the snack market situation in Indonesia and consumer attitude towards extruded snack products indicated that there is an opportunity for success for a new-western style snack (extruded snack) in Indonesia and the key for success are product awareness and product attributes, notably crispiness and flavour. The snack base was manufactured using a co-rotating and intermeshing twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> (Clextral BC- 21) with a constant feed rate and optimized by changing ingredients and extrusion conditions set by a constrained mixture design scheme (Echip computer software). The effect of the extrusion conditions and ingredients on the functional, physical properties of the snack product was also studied in this project. The product cost was also optimized with a constraint of no more than Rp. 4000 per kg (NZ$ 2. 70) finish snack product. The study on the extrudate properties showed that an increase in rice flour increased moisture content (MC), Water Absorption Index (WAI), Nitrogen Solubility Index (NSI) and Breaking Strength (BS), while an increase in soya reduced the protein solubility and the extrudate became brownish. Consumer acceptability was mainly affected by the rice content, soya content and temperature in the last section (T 4). Specific Mechanical Energy (SME), an extrusion parameter, was calculated directly through torque measurements. Higher SME indicated higher energy used in the extrusion process, thus more starch degradation and protein denaturation occurred, producing extrudates with lower BS. Sensory evaluation showed that snacks with lower BS (a crispier product), higher L* and b* colour (light brownish yellow colour) had a higher acceptance. The most preferred snack base was made from 28 % defatted soya flour, 12 % rice flour, 59. 6 % corn grits and 0. 4 % baking soda. These ingredients were processed in a twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> with a feed rate of 4. 47 kg/hr. The four barrel temperature zones were set at 40 Â°C, 80 Â°C, 115 Â°C and 140 Â°C, respectively and 150 ml/hr of water was pumped to the barrel. The screw speed was set at 300 rpm. The snack acceptance was improved by coating the samples with flavours and the most preferred flavour determined by a sensory panel was a spicy flavour (Ethican â€“ QZ 02346; Quest International). The optimum product formulation was then tested in a larger scale consumer test in Indonesia. The results from the final product testing showed that the developed snack was accepted by the target consumers. However some improvements of the product in terms of oil content and product stickiness in the mouth are still necessary. The developed product had a better acceptance over the snacks already in the market in terms of nutritional image, crispiness, product appearance and main ingredients. In addition a feasibility study on snack production in a single <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> was carried out and functional and physical properties of the resulting extrudates were compared with those produced using the twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder.</b> The comparison of WAI, Glass transition temperature (Tg), NSI and BS of snacks manufactured using a single (Lalesse, Universal single <b>screw</b> <b>extruder)</b> and a twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> (Clextral BC 21) showed that the extent of molecules degradation was lower in the single <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> than in the twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder.</b> Sensory properties also indicated that the twin screw extrudate was crispier and suited to the consumers' preference than the single screw extrudate. The developed product could be produced commercially either using a twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> or a single <b>screw</b> <b>extruder,</b> depending on the available equipment, although it was recognized that the snack manufactured using the twin <b>screw</b> <b>extruder</b> had a higher preference compared to those produced using the single <b>screw</b> <b>extruder...</b>|$|R
