25|$|After {{she almost}} kisses Alfie, Kat nearly has sex with Max, but regrets it {{and goes to}} Alfie for comfort. The next day, she tells Alfie {{that she wants to}} get back {{together}} with him, but he tells her that he is not ready as {{he does not want to}} hurt her again. This causes Kat to reevaluate her life, so she visits the convent where she gave birth to Zoe to seek some answers, though it is now a nun's care home. A nun, Sister Ruth (June Whitfield), remembers her going into labour and they talk about the past and the future. Kat then leaves and goes to the police station to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> Harry. Ruth checks their records and discovers that Kat also gave birth to a son. Later, a content Kat returns to Walford and tells Stacey and Alfie that she has finally made her peace with the past and is no longer willing to let Harry control her.|$|E

At the time, however, her body had not been positively identified, and inquiries quickly established that some aspects of his account were false. The murder inquiry, named Operation Green, uncovered a large quantity of strong evidence incriminating Smith, but at first he denied responsibility. He maintained his innocence as his trial began in July 2001, but later in the proceedings he changed his plea to guilty {{and was sentenced to}} life imprisonment. The motive for his crimes was unclear, but police who arrested him believed that a [...] "lack of permanent sexual relations" [...] was a contributing factor.|$|E

500|$|A {{minority}} of apparently more discerning listeners felt that Connotations {{was the right}} music for its time and place. Composer Arthur Berger states, [...] "I think [...] wrote exactly the piece he wanted to write {{because he wanted to}} <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> the new Philharmonic Hall in New York—it wasn't going to be a temple of easy listening, as it were, but a place for serious music-making." [...] Minna Lederman Daniel, a music writer and editor of Modern Music magazine, told Copland, [...] "I think Connotations was the right place for the people and the occasion—indeed the only one properly related to them. It sounds a good deal like certain aspects of the building—big, spacious, clear, long-lined, and it sounds very like you... To those familiar with your music, the characteristic, identifying moods are perfectly apparent. The special Copland eloquence is there." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{photograph}} {{was one of}} several taken by Leibovitz of seven-months pregnant 28-year-old Moore, then carrying the couple's second daughter, Scout LaRue. The photographs ranged from Moore in lacy underwear and spiked high heels, to a revealing peignoir. The final selection had Moore wearing only a diamond ring. [...] Joanne Gair worked on make-up for the shoot. Samuel Irving Newhouse, Jr., chairman of Conde Nast Publications, was very supportive of the chosen cover despite the potential for lost sales. Tina Brown, Vanity Fair editor, quickly realized that there would be harsh backlash for regular distribution of the magazine; the issue had to be wrapped in a white envelope with only Moore's eyes visible. Some editions had a brown wrapper that implied naughtiness. [...] However, Brown viewed the image as a chance to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> the decade of the 1990s after a decade dominated by power suits. Approximately 100 million people saw the cover.|$|E
500|$|With the album, OutKast {{wanted to}} <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> urban {{life as an}} African American in the South, {{particularly}} Atlanta. Written when they were teenagers, much of the album addresses coming of age topics, and has themes of self-empowerment and reflections on life in the New South. Encyclopedia of Popular Music editor Colin Larkin writes that the album [...] "compris tales of the streets of their local East Point and Decatur neighbourhoods". The album's segue tracks illustrate Southern life. The lyrics incorporate tongue-twisters, triplet rhyme schemes, repetitive vocal hooks, Southern slang, such as the recurring phrase [...] "ain't no thang but a chicken wing" [...] repeated throughout [...] "Ain't No Thang". The duo also intersperse their lyrics with references to classic cars, marijuana use, s, and players, which Big Boi defines as [...] "somebody who {{can take care of}} they business in the game, the game of life". His flow is frenetic and has a rapid delivery, while André 3000 raps in a more relaxed cadence, with staccato rhymes, and occasionally sings on the album. Writer Martin C.

500|$|Regarding the {{controversial}} period of her career, Madonna said, [...] "I feel I've been misunderstood. I tried to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> {{feeling good about}} yourself and exploring your sexuality, but people took it to mean that everyone should {{go out and have}} sex with everyone, and that I {{was going to be the}} leader of that. So I decided to leave it alone because that's what everyone ended up concentrating on. Sex is such a taboo subject and it's such a distraction that I'd rather not even offer it up." [...] During 1994, Madonna started recording her sixth studio album. She collaborated with R producers such as Dallas Austin, Dave [...] "Jam" [...] Hall, and Babyface, and also enlisting British producer Nellee Hooper to the project. It became one of the very few occasions where she collaborated with well-known producers, the first since Nile Rodgers on Like a Virgin (1984). When asked about the record, Madonna said she wanted people to concentrate on the musical aspects of it, and would like the songs to speak for themselves. She also commented that it was because she was not interested in giving many interviews and being on the cover of magazines. She described the album as [...] "a combination of pop, R, hip-hop and a Madonna record. It's very, very romantic". In an interview with The Face magazine, Madonna explained her inspirations behind Bedtime Stories as well as the reason for teaming up with R song producers.|$|E
500|$|On {{the story}} side, McMillen {{explained}} that the religious tone is based on his own experiences with his family, split between Catholics and born-again Christians. McMillen noted that while both sides born out faith from the same Bible, their attitudes were different; he found some of the Catholic rituals his family performed inspiring, while other beliefs they had were condemning of several pastimes McMillen had participated in like Dungeons & Dragons. He took inspiration from that duality to create Isaacs narrative, showing how religion can both instill harmful feelings while also bringing about dark creativity. McMillen also considered the scare tactics used by the Christian right to condemn popular media of the 1980s, such as heavy metal and video games. McMillen noted {{how many of the}} propaganda films from this period features satanic cults that would sacrifice children, and he noted how many Biblical stories mirrored these concepts, subsequently building the story around that. He also stated that he also tended to like [...] "really weird stuff" [...] relating to toilet humor and similar types of off-color humor that did not sit well with his family and which he had explored in previous games before Super Meat Boy. While Super Meat Boy helped to make his reputation (including being one of the featured developers in [...] ), he felt it was a [...] "safe" [...] game considering his preferred type of humor, and used Isaac to return to this form, considering that the game could easily be [...] "career suicide" [...] but would <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> what he really wanted to do.|$|E
2500|$|Strawson {{holds that}} a similar {{analysis}} is applicable to all speech acts, not just illocutionary ones: [...] "To say a statement is true is not to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> a statement, but rather to perform the act of agreeing with, accepting, or endorsing a statement. [...] When one says 'It's true that it's raining,' one asserts no more than 'It's raining.'

2500|$|Flying an American flag {{upside down}} is not {{necessarily}} meant as political protest. The practice has its origin in a distress signal; displaying a flag in this manner is [...] "a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property"; It can also {{be viewed as an}} act of desecration. It has been used by extension to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> distress in civic, political, or other areas.

2500|$|To {{classify}} the {{computation time}} (or similar resources, such as space consumption), one {{is interested in}} proving {{upper and lower bounds}} on the minimum amount of time required by the most efficient algorithm solving a given problem. The complexity of an algorithm is usually taken to be its worst-case complexity, unless specified otherwise. Analyzing a particular algorithm falls under the field of analysis of algorithms. To show an upper bound T(n) on the time complexity of a problem, one needs to show only that there is a particular algorithm with running time at most T(n). However, proving lower bounds is much more difficult, since lower bounds <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> all possible algorithms that solve a given problem. The phrase [...] "all possible algorithms" [...] includes not just the algorithms known today, but any algorithm that might be discovered in the future. To show a lower bound of T(n) for a problem requires showing that no algorithm can have time complexity lower than T(n).|$|E

In early 1963, NAACP leadership {{attempted to}} arrange meetings with church leadership, but were rebuffed in their efforts. Later that year, University of Utah professor Sterling McMurrin arranged a meeting between the NAACP and church leaders. N. Eldon Tanner and Hugh B. Brown, the two counselors to David O.

The NAACP threatened to protest at the October 1963 General Conference if the LDS church did not <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> civil rights. Brown promised that a statement would be made. Sterling McMurrin wrote the statement, which McKay approved. McKay did not want their statement to be an [...] "official pronouncement of the First Presidency," [...] perhaps because some apostles were against civil rights.

40|$|This thesis {{highlights}} {{the ways in}} which Portnoy's Complaint <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> the power of psychoanalysis. The first section explores Sigmund Freud and his work in cultural context, looking at Freud's Jewish identity and the changing role of psychoanalysis in American history. The second section examines Freud's essays in detail, exploring how they both permeate and inform Philip Roth's novel. Included are essays dealing with parents, object-choice, obsessive acts, religion and humor. I argue that Roth presents psychoanalysis as a tool. He successfully employs analysis as a means of connecting one man's experience with a more general audience, yet he also shows how his protagonist's unrealistic expectations of psychoanalysis yield unsatisfying results. The novel {{is more than just a}} comedy about identity issues and struggles with rules and power; Roth's decision to portray analysis like Judaism (both featuring systems of belief, authority figures, and rituals) <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> deeper <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> how they are both limited conventions...|$|R
