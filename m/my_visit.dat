25|$|At {{the date}} of <b>my</b> <b>visit,</b> the volcano had poured out, for five months continuously, a stream of lava on the Legaspi side from the very summit. The viscid mass bubbled quietly but grandly, and overran {{the border of the}} crater, {{descending}} several hundred feet in a glowing wave, like red-hot iron. Gradually, fading as the upper surface cooled, it changed to a thousand sparkling rills among the crevices, and, as it passed beyond the line of complete vision behind the woods near the base, the fires twinkled like stars, or the scintillions of a dying conflagration. More than half of the mountain height was thus illuminated.|$|E

500|$|Sobers {{regained his}} former {{popularity}} {{and kept the}} West Indies cricket captaincy until 1972; {{he retired from the}} sport two years later. He was subsequently knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1975 for his services to cricket, and named one of the ten National Heroes of Barbados by the Barbadian government in 1998. His controversial visit to Rhodesia has been described by cricket journalist Siddhartha Vaidyanathan as precursoring the West Indian [...] "rebel tours" [...] affair of the early 1980s, in which black cricketers from the Caribbean broke the apartheid sporting boycott and played in South Africa. The West Indian rebel players became wildly popular among South African cricket fans, but were punished at home with bans from all organised cricket (initially for life, but lifted in 1989), compounded by lasting social and professional ostracism. Sobers retained his stance that politics should not interfere with sport, and was reluctant to criticise the West Indians who toured South Africa. All the same, he came to regret having gone to Rhodesia because of the scandal he had provoked. [...] "Had I known the furore <b>my</b> <b>visit</b> was to cause," [...] he later said, [...] "I would not have gone." ...|$|E

500|$|The poem {{discusses}} {{his understanding}} of nature within the concept of [...] "One Life", an idea that {{is presented as a}} resulting from Coleridge's reflection on his experiences at Clevedon. The conversation poems as a whole are connected to the ideas within The Eolian Harp that deal with understanding the universe. The [...] "One Life" [...] lines added to the 1817 edition interconnect the senses and also connects sensation and experience of the divine with the music of the Aeolian harp. Although the earlier editions do not include the same understanding of perception, there traces of the idea expressed in the earlier editions. Coleridge derived his early understanding from the works of Jakob Böhme, of which he wrote in a 4 July 1817 letter to Ludwig Tieck: [...] "Before <b>my</b> <b>visit</b> to Germany in September, 1798, I had adopted (probably from Behmen's Aurora, which I had conjured over at School) the idea, that Sound was = Light under the praepotence of Gravitation, and Color = Gravitation under the praepotence of Light: and I have never seen reason to change my faith in this respect." [...] Along with this view of sensation, Coleridge adopted Böhme's idea of connecting to God through the will instead of the intellect, and that pantheism should be denied. Coleridge also relies in part on Böhme's understanding of polarity of opposites in his own views of Polar Logic and man's attempt to return to Paradise.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the same}} time, Fitzhugh Lee was sending {{his old friend}} and classmate taunting {{messages}} across the river. One of the more challenging messages said [...] "I wish you would put up your sword, leave my state, and go home. You ride a good horse, I ride a better. If you won't go home, return <b>my</b> <b>visit,</b> and bring me a sack of coffee.".|$|E

I ardently hope that <b>my</b> <b>visit</b> will serve to strengthen the goodwill between us, {{and that it will}} reassure everyone of the Catholic Church's desire for interreligious dialogue and cooperation in building a more just and fraternal world. To everyone I extend the hand of friendship, recalling the splendid words of the Dhammapada: [...] "Better than a thousand useless words is one single word that gives peace...." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first test}} flight {{coincided with a}} visit by United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to China, and was {{initially}} interpreted by the Pentagon as a possible signal to the visiting U.S. delegation. Speaking to reporters in Beijing, secretary Gates said [...] "I asked President Hu about it directly, {{and he said that}} the test had {{absolutely nothing to do with}} <b>my</b> <b>visit</b> and there had been a pre-planned test." [...] Hu seemed surprised by Gates' inquiry, prompting speculations that the test might have been a signal sent unilaterally by the Chinese military. [...] Abraham M. Denmark of the Center for New American Security in Washington, along with Michael Swaine, an expert on the PLA and United States–China military relations, explained that senior officials are not involved in day-to-day management of aircraft development and were unaware of the test.|$|E

2500|$|British author Nicholas Hagger {{writes that}} after seizing control of Libya, Muammar Gaddafi [...] "declared" [...] on 1 December 1978 [...] "that the Muslim {{calendar}} should {{start with the}} death of the prophet Mohammed in 632 rather than the hijra (Mohammed's 'emigration' from Mecca to Medina) in 622". This put the country ten solar years behind the standard Muslim calendar. However, according to the 2006 Encyclopedia of the Developing World, [...] "More confusing still is Qaddafi's unique Libyan calendar, which counts the years from the Prophet's birth, or sometimes from his death. The months July and August, named after Julius and Augustus Caesar, are now Nasser and Hannibal respectively." [...] Reflecting on a 2001 visit to the country, American reporter Neil MacFarquhar observed, [...] "Life in Libya was so unpredictable that people weren't even sure what year it was. The year of <b>my</b> <b>visit</b> was officially 1369. But just two years earlier Libyans had been living through 1429. No one could quite name for me the day the count changed, especially since both remained in play.... Event organizers threw up their hands and put the Western year in parentheses somewhere in their announcements." ...|$|E
2500|$|French's term {{of office}} saw the {{suppression}} in 1916 of the Easter Rising, which briefly coincided with a German invasion scare. An intelligence report on 21 April warned of collaboration between the Irish and the Germans, causing French to mutter [...] "I don't believe a word of it". French received news of the insurrection at noon on 24 April 1916 (Easter Monday), and at once sent two infantry brigades to Ireland and put other formations on standby—the Admiralty warned that the German fleet was out. Woken at 4am on 25 April {{with the news that}} the Germans were shelling Lowestoft, French ordered the commanders of the two Home Defence Armies to prepare for action and ordered two divisions in the Midlands to be prepared to move to the coast. Later that day he was informed that Macready had been deputed to handle the War Office's side of the Irish uprising. [...] French rejected Kitchener's suggestion that he go to Ireland that very evening and take personal command, a decision with which the Prime Minister concurred (despite their previous antagonism, French recorded that Kitchener [...] "expressed no annoyance at <b>my</b> <b>visit</b> to the PM!"). The military authorities reported from Dublin that they had the situation well in hand.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Certainly,' stammered Glossin; 'but {{there are}} cases in which a viva voce conference--Hem!

6000|$|So, when I am wearied with {{wandering}} all day, [...] To thee, my delight, in {{the evening}} I come: [...] No matter what beauties I saw in my way; [...] They were but <b>my</b> <b>visits,</b> but thou art my home! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Besides, uncle, Greshamsbury is in {{a manner}} his own; how can he be banished from his father's house? No, uncle; there is an end of <b>my</b> <b>visits</b> there. They shall find that I will not thrust myself in their way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} laid up a long time," [...] said a lady, who {{accompanied}} the nurse, [...] "and have been longing to resume <b>my</b> <b>visits</b> here, as one or two patients whom I used to nurse are still in hospital." ...|$|R

60|$|Mr. Sherwin's {{anxiety was}} to make <b>my</b> <b>visits</b> to North Villa as few as possible: he evidently feared the {{consequences}} of my seeing his daughter too often. But on this point, I was resolute enough in asserting my own interests, to overpower any resistance on his part. I required him to concede to me the right of seeing Margaret every day--leaving all arrangements of time to depend on his own convenience. After the due number of objections, he reluctantly acquiesced in my demand. I was bound by no engagement whatever, {{limiting the number of}} <b>my</b> <b>visits</b> to Margaret; and I let him see at the outset, that I was now ready in my turn, to impose conditions on him, as he had already imposed them on me.|$|R
