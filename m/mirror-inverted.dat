40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} noise on a graph state generation scheme which exploits a mirror inverting spin chain. Within this scheme the spin chain is used repeatedly as an entanglement bus (EB) to create multi-partite entanglement. The noise model we consider comprises of each spin of this EB being exposed to independent local noise which degrades {{the capabilities of the}} EB. Here we concentrate on quantifying its performance as a single-qubit channel and as a mediator of a two-qubit entangling gate, since these are basic operations necessary for graph state generation using the EB. In particular, for the single-qubit case we numerically calculate the average channel fidelity and whether the channel becomes entanglement breaking, i. e. expunges any entanglement the transferred qubit may have with other external qubits. We find that neither local decay nor dephasing noise cause entanglement breaking. This is in contrast to local thermal and depolarizing noise where we determine a critical length and critical noise coupling, respectively, at which entanglement breaking occurs. The critical noise coupling for local depolarizing noise is found to exhibit a power-law dependence on the chain length. For two-qubits we similarly compute the average gate fidelity and whether the ability for this gate to create entanglement is maintained. The concatenation of these noisy gates {{for the construction of a}} five-qubit linear cluster state and a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state indicates that the level of noise that can be tolerated for graph state generation is tightly constrained.

40|$|One of {{the basic}} {{problems}} that researchers have to face, when dealing with early Chinese bamboo or wood manuscripts, is natural disintegration. In almost every case, the binding strings that once held together the slips originally constituting a manuscript do either not exist anymore or only remain as traces on individual slips. The problem of reconstruction becomes even more complex, if the manuscript in question was not scientifically excavated or even is of unknown provenance. The present article shows how an analysis of verso lines and <b>mirror-inverted</b> imprints of writing {{on a group of}} bamboo slips from the Yuelu Academy collection can help to reconstruct the original structure of the respective manuscript roll. The described analysis can in certain cases enable or facilitate the complete reconstruction of bamboo manu-scripts, even if external archeological evidence is lacking...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The goal of {{this study}} was to explore whether the ability of precise <b>mirror-inverted</b> {{movements}} can be learned and improved with the device Mirroprep and whether practice success can be transferred to the clinical situation. Three groups of students at different levels of dental study and different achievement levels were asked to perform a drawing exercise with indirect vision using Mirroprep. Further, the group of most senior students were asked whether the motor skills learned with this device were helpful in clinical tooth preparations by use of the dental mirror. According to the test results, we were able to show that mir-ror-inverted motor functions can be learned and improved by practice and that it is also helpful for performing tooth preparations. Because of this, it is deemed reasonable for students to start practicing with the training device during their preclinical studies and to have their skills tested...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} high-variability training (HVT) on the production and perception of French bilabial voiced and voiceless stops by German native speakers. Stop consonants in the two languages differ with respect to several articulatory and acoustic features. German learners of French (Experiment Group) trained the perception of word-initial bilabial stops spoken by six French native speakers using identification tests, whereas subjects of a Control Group did not perform a training. Additional perception and production tests of French words including bilabial, alveolar, and velar stops in all word positions were performed to capture the impact of HVT. Subjects {{were found to be}} quite good at distinguishing voiced and voiceless stops. However, voiceless stops received lower correctness scores than voiced ones and subjects of the Experiment group were able to further increase their scores after training. Results for production are <b>mirror-inverted</b> showing that subjects of the Experiment Group successfully produced longer negative VOT values but did not show an improvement for voiceless stops...|$|E
40|$|In this {{doctoral}} thesis {{a series of}} chiral (nonracemic) diorganotin dihydrides was synthesized and subjected to dehydrocoupling reactions using Wilkinson’s catalyst [RhCl(PPh 3) 3], which results under the release of hydrogen {{in the formation of}} chiral polystannanes and/or cyclic oligomers. With the synthesis of poly[bis(cis-myrtanyl) ]stannane (9) und poly[bis(trans-myrtanyl) ]stannane (10) the first chiral polystannanes were obtained. First evidence became available that the chiral information of the pendant groups can be transferred onto the Sn–Sn backbone of the polystannanes. Furthermore, with the synthesis of poly[(2 S) - 2 -methylbutyl(n-butyl) ]stannane ((2 S) - 17 a) {{for the first time a}} chiral polystannane was produced in quantitative yield and fully characterized. In extensive studies of these light- and moisture-sensitive class of compounds the amplification of the optical activity was observed for the first time for a polystannane. With the synthesis of (2 R) - 17 a (the <b>mirror-inverted</b> polystannane compared to (2 S) - 17 a) it was shown that the choice of the chirality of its pendant groups directly influences the handedness of the helical structure of chiral polystannanes and thus their ability to reverse the polarization direction of light. Moreover, in several polymerization experiments, the influence of the distance of the chirality center of the polymeric tin chain on the overall orientation and the optical activity of polytstannanes has been extensively studied. At the same time the limits of the dehydrocoupling reactions with Wilkinson’s catalyst for the formation of polystannanes (in terms of steric hindrance of the organic pendant groups at the tin atom) could be determined...|$|E
40|$|Procedural {{learning}} {{is a form of}} memory where people implicitly acquire a skill through repeated practice. People with Parkinson's disease (PD) have been found to acquire motor adaptation, a form of motor procedural learning, similarly to healthy older adults but they have deficits in long-term retention. A similar pattern of normal learning on initial exposure with a deficit in retention seen on subsequent days has also been seen in mirror-reading, a form of non-motor procedural learning. It is a well-studied fact that disrupting sleep will impair the consolidation of procedural memories. Given the prevalence of sleep disturbances in PD, the lack of retention on following days seen in these studies could simply be a side effect of this well-known symptom of PD. Because of this, we wondered whether people with PD would present with deficits in the short-term retention of a non-motor procedural learning task, when the test of retention was done the same day as the initial exposure. The aim {{of the present study was}} then to investigate acquisition and retention in the immediate short term of cognitive procedural learning using the mirror-reading task in people with PD. This task involved two conditions: one where triads of <b>mirror-inverted</b> words were always new that allowed assessing the learning of mirror-reading skill and another one where some of the triads were presented repeatedly during the experiment that allowed assessing the word-specific learning. People with PD both ON and OFF their normal medication were compared to healthy older adults and young adults. Participants were re-tested 50 minutes break after initial exposure to probe for short-term retention. The results of this study show that all groups of participants acquired and retained the two skills (mirror-reading and word-specific) similarly. These results suggest that neither healthy ageing nor the degeneration within the basal ganglia that occurs in PD does affect the mechanisms that underpin the acquisition of these new non-motor procedural learning skills and their short-term memories...|$|E
