5|$|Arab and Islamic {{influences}} strongly mark Antemoro culture. Traditionally, Antemoro men's clothing {{included a}} turban or fez style hat and long, loose robes {{similar to those}} worn in <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the Muslim world. Harefo reeds were woven to form mats (tafitsihy) that were sewn together to form jackets and tunics (with long sleeves for older men); a loincloth made of fanto (beaten barkcloth) was worn beneath the ensemble. Women wore sleeveless sheath dresses made from two or three reed mats sewn together and belted at the waist or drawn over one shoulder. Adolescent and adult women often also wore a mat bandeau or halter top. It was historically forbidden for women to wear lambas made of cotton or any other material than woven raffia mats, as it was believed this could render them more attractive to men outside their clan, with whom they were forbidden to marry.|$|E
5|$|As a {{traveller}} {{he visited}} Scotland and <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> Britain and wrote about them. Many of his travels {{took him to}} places that were little known to the British public and the travelogues he produced, accompanied by painted and engraved colour plates, were much appreciated. Each tour started at his home and related in detail the route, the scenery, the habits and activities {{of the people he}} met, their customs and superstitions and the wildlife he saw or heard about. He travelled on horseback accompanied by his servant, Moses Griffiths, who sketched the things they encountered, later to work these up into illustrations for the books. He was an amiable man with a large circle of friends and was still busily following his interests into his sixties. He enjoyed good health throughout his life and died at Downing at the age of seventy two.|$|E
5|$|As with so <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the myth, the {{resolution}} {{is complex and}} varied. Often, Horus and Set divide the realm between them. This division can be equated with any of several fundamental dualities that the Egyptians saw in their world. Horus may receive the fertile lands around the Nile, the core of Egyptian civilization, in which case Set takes the barren desert or the foreign lands {{that are associated with}} it; Horus may rule the earth while Set dwells in the sky; and each god may take one of the two traditional halves of the country, Upper and Lower Egypt, in which case either god may be connected with either region. Yet in the Memphite Theology, Geb, as judge, first apportions the realm between the claimants and then reverses himself, awarding sole control to Horus. In this peaceable union, Horus and Set are reconciled, and the dualities that they represent have been resolved into a united whole. Through this resolution, order is restored after the tumultuous conflict.|$|E

5|$|The {{silvertip shark}} is caught by {{commercial}} and artisan fisheries across its range using longlines, gillnets, and trawls, both intentionally and as bycatch. The fins are highly valued for shark fin soup and are {{sold on the}} export market, along with the skin and cartilage. The meat is marketed locally, fresh or dried and salted, as are the jaws and teeth. Silvertip sharks {{are known to be}} taken by fisheries in Indonesia, Myanmar, and the Philippines, as well as by various Indian Ocean nations with coral reef fisheries; it is also an increasingly important catch of pelagic fisheries, where it is often finned at sea. This species is susceptible to overfishing, due to its slow reproductive rate and tendency to stay in a certain area. It {{is believed to have been}} extirpated by Indonesian artisan fishers at Scott Reef off northern Australia, and is likely becoming rare in <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> its range. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the silvertip shark as Vulnerable.|$|E
