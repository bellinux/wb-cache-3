A Banana Genome program and a genetic data bank, the DataMusa, is in place institutionally in Brazil to monitor and conduct research. The data bank has 40,000 sequences of DNA and another 5,000 genes and under surveillance of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa) in Brazil. In Brazil, 20 scholars and researchers {{are working on the}} program, including ongoing collaboration in {{research into}} bananas with the Catholic University of Brasília (UCB) and with the French Agricultural Research Center for International Development (Cirad). [...] Notably the programme has done much since 2002 to curtail the effects of the black sigatoka which previously caused widespread disaster to banana plantations in the Amazon. The Brazilian Banana Genome program is also supported by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) internationally with support from experts in countries such as France and Belgium, UK, Japan and the Czech Republic. Apart from <b>molecular</b> <b>genomics</b> research, Embrapa also has a successful banana breeding program, generating disease-resistant varieties, such as the Pacovan Ken. [...] Pacovan Ken, a banana breed resistant to yellow and black sigatoka and to Panama disease launched in November 2001 as a national crop plant in Brazil, is named after Embrapa scientist Kenneth Shepherd.|$|E
40|$|DNA microarrays {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} methods for <b>molecular</b> <b>genomics,</b> but this technique is often associated with experimental complications and difficulties in the analysis. Moreover, the greatest part of genes displayed on an array is often not directly involved in the cellular process being studied. Recently, we proposed a data mining algorithm, based on the identification of genes involved in a given process, the calculation of interactions among them and their ranking according to number of interactions. Genes in the highest cluster are defined as "leader genes". These findings may lead to an ad hoc and therefore more significant experimentation. However, at present this complex process is performed manually. In this work, we present the general architecture of LeaderGene, an automated tool for ab-initio <b>molecular</b> <b>genomics.</b> Three different and independent parts: (1) Identification of gene list; (2) Calculation of weighted number of links; (3) Genes clustering. Initial inputs are provided by user; then, output of part 1 and part 2, respectively, become inputs of parts 2 and 3. The development of an user-friendly software capable to automatically compute leader genes in a given cellular system will allow further progresses in this field of <b>molecular</b> <b>genomics...</b>|$|E

40|$|Training {{anatomic}} {{and clinical}} pathology {{residents in the}} principles of bioinformatics is a challenging endeavor. Most residents receive little to no formal exposure to bioinformatics during medical education, {{and most of the}} pathology training is spent interpreting histopathology slides using light microscopy or focused on laboratory regulation, management, and interpretation of discrete laboratory data. At a minimum, residents should be familiar with data structure, data pipelines, data manipulation, and data regulations within clinical laboratories. Fellowship-level training should incorporate advanced principles unique to each subspecialty. Barriers to bioinformatics education include the clinical apprenticeship training model, ill-defined educational milestones, inadequate faculty expertise, and limited exposure during medical training. Online educational resources, case-based learning, and incorporation into <b>molecular</b> <b>genomics</b> education could serve as effective educational strategies. Overall, pathology bioinformatics training can be incorporated into pathology resident curricula, provided there is motivation to incorporate, institutional support, educational resources, and adequate faculty expertise...|$|E

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{molecular}} biology has paved {{way for an}} era of personalized medicine. Though medical disciplines such as oncology and cardiology are advanced {{in their use of}} genomics, implementation has been slower in other specialties, such as orthopaedics. Recent advances in genomic technology have shed light on the underlying genetic basis of various pediatric orthopaedic disorders. Prior understanding of the genetic makeup of a patient may help individualize care in patients with conditions including idiopathic scoliosis, congenital talipes equinovarus and congenital limb deformities. The fastpaced growth of information in orthogenomics often makes it challenging for an orthopaedic surgeon to effectively use this information for patient care. Genetic characterization of a patient will help indicate risk of progression of a condition, recurrence and/or response to a treatment modality, and a collaborative approach between an orthopaedic surgeon and a geneticist can help tailor patient care. The following review article summarizes current understanding in <b>molecular</b> <b>genomics</b> of common pediatric orthopaedic disorders...|$|E
40|$|Research on {{the effects}} of {{nutrition}} on the function and health of organs in the human body, such as liver and intestine, is difficult, because for this research organ tissue is needed. Since nutrition research is usually performed in healthy volunteers, this tissue is difficult to obtain. However, to find out what happens on cellular level we do need human cells. Because blood cells are transported through the entire body and are relatively easy to obtain, these cells are ideal to study the effect of nutrition on cellular level. For this research we used the latest <b>molecular</b> <b>genomics</b> techniques to study the activity (on/off switching, increase/decrease) of all our genes at once. We found that consumption of different types of fat, both directly after consumption and after continued intake, changed the activity of specific groups of genes in these cells.

40|$|Abstract Genomics and {{proteomics}} {{have promised}} to change the practice of dentistry and oral pathology, allowing the identification and the characterization of risk factors and therapeutic targets at a molecular level. However, mass-scale <b>molecular</b> <b>genomics</b> and proteomics suffer from some pitfalls: gene/protein expression are significant only if inserted in a detailed network of molecular pathways and gene/gene, gene/protein and protein/protein interactions. The proper analysis of these complex pictures requires the contribution of theoretical disciplines, like bioinformatics and data mining. In particular, data-mining of existing information could become a strong starting point to formulate new targeted hypotheses and to plan ad hoc experimentation. In this review, {{advantages and disadvantages of}} the above-mentioned disciplines and their potential in oral pathology are discussed. The leader gene approach is a new data mining algorithm, recently applied to some oral diseases and their correlation with systemic conditions.

40|$|Abstract: Breast {{cancer is}} a {{heterogeneous}} disease with a complex etiology that develops from different cellular lineages, progresses along multiple molecular pathways, and demonstrates wide variability in response to treatment. The “standard of care ” approach to breast cancer treatment in which all patients receive similar interventions is rapidly being replaced by personalized medicine, based on molecular characteristics of individual patients. Both inherited and somatic genomic variation is providing useful information for customizing treatment regimens for breast cancer to maximize efficacy and minimize adverse side effects. In this article, we review (1) hereditary breast cancer and current use of inherited susceptibility genes in patient management; (2) the potential of newly-identified breast cancer-susceptibility variants for improving risk assessment; (3) {{advantages and disadvantages of}} direct-to-consumer testing; (4) molecular characterization of sporadic breast cancer through immunohistochemistry and gene expression profiling and opportunities for personalized prognostics; and (5) pharmacogenomic influences on the effectiveness of current breast cancer treatments. <b>Molecular</b> <b>genomics</b> has the potential to revolutionize clinical practice and improve the lives of women with breast cancer...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Recently {{reported}} SEER data revealing {{an increase}} in the number of younger women who present with advanced breast cancer at diagnosis has led to much speculation regarding epidemiological factors that play a role in breast cancer risk and that may be modifiable by lifestyle. <b>Molecular</b> <b>genomics</b> has identified biological pathways that affect breast cancer prognosis and inform treatment decisions. Depending on menopausal status and breast cancer subtype, evidence is emerging that lifestyle could be implicated not only in the risk for breast cancer but also outcomes following breast cancer diagnosis. Several biologic mechanisms have been explored explaining the physiologic role of lifestyle and cancer risk and survival. In this report, we explore the interaction between lifestyle, breast cancer phenotype, and outcomes and review potential molecular mechanisms linking lifestyle to risk and prognosis in order to establish a platform for future exploration. The cost of breast cancer treatment and breast cancer morbidity and mortality during a woman’s productive years impose a psychosocial and socioeconomic burden on our nation. Efforts to ease that burden through lifestyle modification shoul...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} chapter of this book we {{identified}} the interdependence of method, data and theory as an important influence on the progress of science. The first several chapters focused mostly on progress in theory, in the areas of integrating spatial and temporal complexity into ecological analysis, the emergence of landscape ecology and its transformation into a multi-scale gradient-based science. These chapters weaved in some discussion about the interrelationships between method and these theoretical approaches. In particular, we discussed how powerful computing, large spatial databases and GIS cross-fertilized ecological theory by enabling new kinds of analyses and new scopes of investigation. However, up to this point we have given relatively little attention to the third leg of this triad, data. This and following chapters focus explicitly on data. The next several chapters discuss the advances in broad-scale data collection and analysis enabled by remote sensing, <b>molecular</b> <b>genomics</b> and satellite GPS telemetry, and how these data have made fundamental contributions to virtually all branches of ecology, especially spatial ecology, landscape ecology, and global scale research...|$|E
