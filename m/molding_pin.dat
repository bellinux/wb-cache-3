Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) was used as both a plasticizer and a compatibilizer in the blends. In order to prepare hard capsules for pharmaceutical applications using the well-established method of dipping stainless steel <b>mold</b> <b>pins</b> into solution, solutions with higher solids concentrations (up to 30 %) were developed. The solutions, films and capsules of the different gelatin-starch blends were characterized by viscosity, transparency, tensile testing, water contact angle and SEM. The linear microstructure of the high amylose starch, and the flexible and more hydrophilic hydroxylpropylene groups grafted onto the starch improved the compatibility between the gelatin and starch.

40|$|A nondisintegrating, {{controlled}} release, asymmetric membrane capsular {{system of}} flurbiprofen {{was developed and}} evaluated for controlled release of the drug to overcome some of its side effects. Asymmetric membrane capsules were prepared using fabricated glass <b>mold</b> <b>pins</b> by phase inversion process. The effect of different formulation variables was studied based on 23 factorial design; namely, level of osmogen, membrane thickness, and level of pore former. Effects of polymer diffusibility and varying osmotic pressure on drug release were also studied. Membrane characterization by scanning electron microscopy showed an outer dense region with less pores and an inner porous region for the prepared asymmetric membrane. Differential scanning calorimetry studies showed no incompatibility between the drug and the excipients used in the study. In vitro release studies for all the prepared formulations were done (n= 6). Statistical test (Dunnett multiple comparison test) was applied for in vitro drug release atP>. 05. The best formulation closely corresponded to the extra design checkpoint formulation by a similarity (f 2) value of 92. 94. The drug release was independent of pH but dependent on the osmotic pressure of the dissolution medium.

40|$|Asymmetric membrane-controlled {{porosity}} osmotic pumps {{of cellulose}} acetate with different pore forming agents such as glycerol, polyethylene glycol and dibutyl phthalate, were fabricated and studied for osmotic release behavior from the system. The effects of various pore-forming agents on the physical characteristics of the polymer film like tensile strength, weight variation, wall thickness, surface area, porosity and void volume were studied {{as a function of}} pore forming agent. The asymmetric membrane capsules were fabricated by dip-coating process using stainless steel <b>mold</b> <b>pins</b> of the shape of capsule body and cap and were evaluated for in situ formation of delivery pores. The effect of pore forming agents on the porosity of asymmetric membrane was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, and also by void volume determination of each membrane. Dye-test revealed that the fabricated systems followed osmotic release. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the porosity depends upon the concentration and type of pore forming agent used. However no significant effect on the thickness and weight variation of asymmetric membrane capsule were observed, but the tensile strength of the film varied with the concentration and type of pore forming agent used.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} is to develop and statistically optimize the osmotically controlled asymmetric membrane capsules of solid dispersion of lycopene. Solid dispersions of lycopene with β-cyclodextrin in different ratios were prepared using solvent evaporation method. Solubility studies showed that the solid dispersion with 1 [*]:[*] 5 (lycopene[*]:[*]β-cyclodextrin) exhibited optimum solubility (56. 25 [*]mg/mL) for osmotic controlled delivery. Asymmetric membrane capsules (AMCs) were prepared on glass <b>mold</b> <b>pins</b> via dip coating method. Membrane characterization by scanning electron microscopy showed inner porous region and outer dense region. Central composite design response surface methodology was applied for the optimization of AMCs. The independent variables were ethyl cellulose (X 1), glycerol (X 2), and NaCl (X 3) which were varied at different levels to analyze the effect on dependent variables (percentage of cumulative drug release (Y 1) and correlation coefficient of drug release (Y 2)). The effect of independent variables on the response was significantly influential. The F 18 was selected as optimized formulation based on percentage of CDR (cumulative drug release) of 85. 63 % and correlation coefficient of 0. 9994. The optimized formulation was subjected to analyze the effect of osmotic pressure and agitational intensity on percentage of CDR.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{demonstrate}} that the asymmetric membrane capsule can be used to deliver apoorly water soluble drug with a pH sensitive solubility such as gliclazide. In order to obtain the desireddelivery duration, the drug was solubilized with the use of a pH-controlling excipient. The capsule wallmembrane was made by a phase inversion process, in which asymmetric membrane was formed on glassmold pins by dipping the <b>mold</b> <b>pins</b> into a coating solution containing a polymeric material followed bydipping into a quench solution. This study evaluates the influence of coating formulation that wascellulose acetate (CA), ethyl cellulose (EC), and plasticizer (glycerin and PEG 600). Results showcapsule that made by CA with glycerol and PEG 600 (F 8), which appear in asymmetric structure and areable to release gliclazide(GLZ) in significant percentage. Results show that sodium bicarbonate and Dmannitolis able to promote the release of GLZ from polymeric capsules prepared with CA withasymmetrical membrane. The addition of solubilizer, sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) could enhance therelease of GLZ by micelle formation of GLZ. Based on these results, influence of core formulationvariables, including D-mannitol, sodium bicarbonate and the added amount of SLS were examined onthe release of GLZ. It was found that HPMC 15 cp was suitable to be a thickening agent and both addedamount of HPMC and SLS showed a comparable and profoundly positive effect. In vitro release studiesfor all the prepared formulations were done (n= 3). Statistical test (Dunnett’s multiple comparison test) was applied for in vitro drug release at P> 0. 05. The best formulation closely corresponded to themarketed formulation by a similarity (f 2) value of 78. 36 and difference (f 1) value of 4. 49.

40|$|Capillarity {{can be used}} {{to direct}} {{anisotropic}} colloidal particles to precise locations and to orient them by using interface curvature as an applied field. We show this in experiments in which the shape of the interface is <b>molded</b> by <b>pinning</b> to vertical pillars of different cross-sections. These interfaces present well-defined curvature fields that orient and steer particles along complex trajectories. Trajectories and orientations are predicted by a theoretical model in which capillary forces and torques are related to Gaussian curvature gradients and angular deviations from principal directions of curvature. Interface curvature diverges near sharp boundaries, similar to an electric field near a pointed conductor. We exploit this feature to induce migration and assembly at preferred locations, and to create complex structures. We also report a repulsive interaction, in which microparticles move away from planar bounding walls along curvature gradient contours. These phenomena should be widely useful in the directed assembly of micro- and nanoparticles with potential application in the fabrication of materials with tunable mechanical or electronic properties, in emulsion production, and in encapsulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{applicability}} of the centrifugal casting technique {{to the production of}} multiple castings of fuel pins of small diameter and of thin fuel plates was investigated. Fuel pins measuring 0. 185 in. in diameter by 4 1 / 4 in. long of unalloyed uranium and of a uranium- 2 wt. % zirconium alloy were cast successfully in batches of sixteen pins per melt. Sixteen different metals and alloys were used as mold materials.

40|$|The {{demand of}} ultra thin plastic parts in global {{industries}} is increasing today. Ultra thin plastic parts are widely produced using injection molding processes {{and it is}} understood that warpage issue is regularly found in producing these parts. This situation happens due to lacking of knowledge in selecting the best injection molding parameters to produce parts with minimal warpage. In addition, designers also have difficulties to control the parameters since the 0. 3 mm thickness of the ultra thin parts is too hard to maintain. Therefore this study is performed purposely {{to determine the best}} parameters can be selected in manufacturing ultra thin plates.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Interface {{geometry}} {{before joining}} {{has been an}} important factor for the welding quality of hot plate welding. In the present study, weld interfaces of six different geometries were studied, namely flat, triangular (308, 458, and 608), rectangular, and semi-circular interfaces. Three materials were used in the study: virgin polypropylene, and 20 and 30 % glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene composites. All specimens used in the experiments were <b>molded</b> using a <b>pin</b> injection gate on a reciprocating injection molding machine. After welding, the joint strength of the composites was determined by a tensile tester. Welded 20 % glass fiber-reinforced polymers were found to exhibit the highest joint strengths. For the parameters selected in the experiments, hot plate temperature, heating time, and geometry of weld interface were found to be the principal factors affecting the joint property of hot plate welded composites. In addition, the triangular and rectangular weld interfaces were found to weld parts of the highest strengths for virgin polypropylene and 20 % glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene composites, respectively, while the joint strengths of 30 % fiber-reinforced composites were improved by adopting non-flat weld interface geometries...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} aspect of the Advanced Accelerator Applications (AAA) program is the development of a casting process by which volatile actinide element (i. e., americium) can be incorporated into metallic alloy fuel pins. The traditional metal fuel casting process uses an inductively heated crucible. The process involves evacuation of the furnace. The evacuation of the furnace also evacuates quartz rods used as fuel <b>pin</b> <b>molds.</b> Once evacuated the open ends of the molds are lowered into the melt; the casting furnace is then rapidly pressurized, forcing the molten metal up into the evacuated molds where solidification occurs. This process works well for the fabrication of metal fuel pins traditionally composed of alloys of uranium and plutonium, but does not work well when highly volatile actinides are included in the melt. Candidate design concepts are being evaluated for their potential to successfully cast alloys containing volatile actinides. The selection of design concepts has been conducted in close cooperation with ANL staff. The research centers on the development of advanced numerical models to assess conditions that significantly impact the transport of volatile actinides during the melt casting process...|$|R
40|$|In the {{manufacturing}} industry, finding a suitable {{location for the}} pin gate (the pin gate is the point from which liquid is poured or injected into a mold) is a difficult problem when viewed from the fluid dynamics of the molding process. However, experience has shown that a suitable pin gate location possesses several geometric characteristics, namely {{the distance from the}} pin gate to any point in the mold should be small and the number of turns on the path from a point in the <b>mold</b> to the <b>pin</b> gate should be small. We address the problem of computing locations that possess these geometric characteristics.

40|$|A high {{resolution}} reconfigurable mold {{has been sought}} after for over 150 years. An ideal reconfigurable mold {{would be capable of}} producing detailed surfaces for use in molding and be capable of fast surface reconfiguration. Such a device would combine the fast speed and repeatability of formative processes, like injection molding, with the flexibility of additive processes, like 3 D printing. An affordable, {{high resolution}}, reconfigurable mold could be a practical tool for a lean, short-run shop or factory, serving as a resin mold, fixturing surface or concrete formwork; to name only a few possible applications. Resembling the common pin art toy, a discrete element pin bed has often been proposed as a design for a reconfigurable mold. Conventional actuation strategies are often cumbersome and expensive, due to the quadratic increase in number of pin elements with increasing surface resolution. Very few designs exist that are capable of producing a reconfigurable pin array at sufficiently high resolution to compete with the cost of making a fixed geometry <b>mold.</b> A practical <b>pin</b> tool, an inexpensive but high resolution molding tool, could be an asset to shops and small business everywhere, but nothing like this currently exists. This thesis presents a concise design strategy, backed up by analytical arguments and empirical evidence which can used to construct an affordable, high resolution reconfigurable pin tool. We address the challenge of quadratic scaling by edge-addressing simple, nonlinear mechanisms to actuate each pin. Edge addressing, along rows and columns of pins, reduces the number of control inputs to a small, linearly increasing value. Nonlinear mechanisms at each discrete pin site allow for a predictable, localized expression of the edge addressed inputs. Two embodiments of this design strategy are proposed and tested. First, a diode/resistive heater array allows for electrical edge addressing and control of a fusible alloy brake to grip or release targeted, sliding pins. Second, an array of screws is edge addressed by mechanical oscillations to generate nonlinear tangential forces in targeted screws, resulting in controllable screw translations. We conclude by summarizing our results and discuss directions for future work. by Benjamin J. Peters. Thesis: S.
