5|$|New Guinea {{crocodiles}} have {{a mostly}} aquatic lifestyle and are largely nocturnal. They spend <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> underwater, often with their nostrils and eyes above the surface. Powerful side-to-side movements of their tails propel {{them through the}} water and they use both tail and legs to steer. When on land, they favour shady, dense areas of undergrowth. They tend to bask in a group during the day, dispersing at night to feed.|$|E
5|$|The Waterloo {{position}} {{was a strong}} one. It consisted of a long ridge running east-west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along {{the crest of the}} ridge ran the Ohain road, a deep sunken lane. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was a large elm tree that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind the crest of the ridge following the Ohain road.|$|E

Race leader and {{eventual}} winner Alberto Contador, along with many others, rode the stage 16 individual time trial with black armbands. The stage was preceded by a minute of silence. Tondó's teammate Branislau Samoilau posted a time that was provisionally best <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> and was visibly overcome with emotion when interviewed by assembled media after his ride.

5|$|Garfield's {{promotion}} {{gave him}} {{command of the}} 20th Brigade of the Army of the Ohio, which was ordered in early 1862 to join Major General Ulysses S. Grant's forces as they advanced on Corinth, Mississippi. Before the 20th Brigade arrived, however, Confederate forces under General Albert Sidney Johnston surprised Grant's men in their camps, driving them back. Garfield's troops got word of the battle and advanced quickly, joining {{the rest of the}} army on the second day to drive the Confederates back across the field and into retreat. The action, later known as the Battle of Shiloh, was the bloodiest of the war to date; Garfield was exposed to fire for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> but emerged uninjured. Major General Henry W. Halleck, Grant's superior, took charge of the combined armies and advanced ponderously toward Corinth; when they arrived, the Confederates had fled.|$|E
5|$|The bluntnose {{stingray}} {{has generally}} nocturnal habits and spends <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> {{buried in the}} substrate. It {{has been known to}} follow the rising tide to forage in water barely deep enough to cover its body. This species preys upon small invertebrates, including crustaceans, annelid worms, and bivalve and gastropod molluscs, and bony fishes. It mainly targets benthic and burrowing organisms, but also opportunistically takes free-swimming prey. In Delaware Bay, this species feeds predominantly on the shrimp Cragon septemspinosa and the blood worm Glycera dibranchiata, and its overall dietary composition is virtually identical to that of the roughtail stingray (D.centroura), with which it shares the bay. The bluntnose stingray is preyed upon by larger fishes such as the bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas). Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium brevissime and Kotorella pronosoma, the monogenean Listrocephalos corona, and the trematodes Monocotyle pricei and Multicalyx cristata.|$|E

5|$|In the 1912 presidential election, Lane {{supported}} Democratic {{candidate and}} New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson, though {{he declined to}} make campaign speeches on Wilson's behalf, citing ICC policy that commissioners act in a nonpartisan manner. Wilson was elected on November 5, 1912, and on November 21 the commissioner spent <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> with Colonel Edward M. House, the President-elect's advisor, who would {{play a key role}} in selecting Cabinet appointees. The possibility of Lane becoming Secretary of the Interior was discussed, but he indicated he was happy in his present position. After the meeting, Lane had second thoughts, and asked House if he would have a free hand as Interior Secretary. House indicated that were he to prove capable in the position, Wilson would not interfere. Colonel House did not immediately recommend Lane for the job, but went on to consider other candidates, such as former San Francisco mayor James D. Phelan and Wilson friend Walter Page.|$|E
5|$|Male {{grasshoppers}} spend <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> stridulating, singing {{more actively}} under optimal conditions and being more subdued when conditions are adverse; females also stridulate, but their efforts are insignificant {{when compared to}} the males. Late-stage male nymphs can sometimes be seen making stridulatory movements, although they lack the equipment to make sounds, demonstrating the importance of this behavioural trait. The songs are a means of communication; the male stridulation seems to express reproductive maturity, the desire for social cohesion and individual well-being. Social cohesion becomes necessary among grasshoppers because of their ability to jump or fly large distances, and the song can serve to limit dispersal and guide others to favourable habitat. The generalised song can vary in phraseology and intensity, and is modified {{in the presence of a}} rival male, and changes again to a courtship song when a female is nearby. In male grasshoppers of the family Pneumoridae, the enlarged abdomen amplifies stridulation.|$|E
5|$|On 20 May the British squadron, {{under the}} command of Captain Charles Marsh Schomberg, {{discovered}} the French off Tamatave and attacked, both sides hampered by light winds which impeded movement for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> During a period of calm weather early in the battle, the French were better positioned than the disorganised British squadron and Roquebert's ships inflicted severe damage on several British vessels before an increasing breeze allowed Schomberg to press home his attack. As the evening approached, the French attempted to escape, Roquebert sacrificing his flagship and ultimately his life to allow the frigates Clorinde and the badly damaged Néréide to escape. Five days later, Schomberg's squadron rediscovered Néréide at Tamatave and persuaded the town's commander to surrender without a fight. The battle was the last action of the Mauritius campaign and confirmed British dominance of the seas east of the Cape of Good Hope {{for the rest of the}} Napoleonic Wars.|$|E

Although he cultivated a myth that he never read, Lloyd George was in fact a very early riser, who would have already have completed <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day's</b> paperwork before breakfast, and therefore preferred to do business at breakfast meetings rather than in the evening.

5|$|Solitary and slow-moving, the marbled {{electric}} ray may remain motionless for several days at a time. It is more active at night and spends <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> buried in sediment with only the eyes and spiracles showing. Consistent with its sluggish nature, the marbled {{electric ray}} has a low blood oxygen carrying capacity and heart rate (10–15 beats/min), and consumes less oxygen than other sharks and rays of similar size. It is highly tolerant of being deprived of oxygen (hypoxia), allowing it to cope with deoxygenated bottom waters or being stranded in small pools by the falling tide. The ray stops breathing entirely when the oxygen partial pressure in the water drops below 10–15 Torr, and can survive such a state {{for at least five}} hours. It deals with extreme hypoxia by coupling anaerobic glycolysis to additional energy-producing pathways in its mitochondria, which serves to slow down the accumulation of potentially harmful lactate within its cells.|$|E
5|$|The Storm Prediction Center {{issued a}} {{moderate}} risk for severe weather across western Kansas and small portions of Oklahoma, Colorado and Nebraska for May 4, while temperatures {{were in the}} mid to high 80s°F (near 30°C). The atmosphere remained capped for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> but storms began to develop in the late afternoon hours in western Oklahoma and the eastern Texas Panhandle. The most intense supercells developed in the early evening hours across northwestern Oklahoma and southwestern Kansas. They eventually produced 25 tornadoes, including the devastating Greensburg tornado and three other extremely large tornadoes which followed the Greensburg tornado late that evening. The supercells remained intact well into the overnight hours as the extremely unstable air mass precluded rapid dissipation expected with the loss of daytime heating which would normally be expected in the Plains. The last tornado of the night did not lift until shortly after 2:00a.m. early on May 5.|$|E
5|$|The fall of Isle de France {{marked the}} end of the active British {{campaign}} and saw six frigates and over 200 cannon fall into British hands, in addition to the island itself, which was returned to its original Dutch name of Mauritius, and has been known as such ever since. The island remained under British control until granted independence in 1968. The British forces in the region were scaled back, command passing to Beaver, who sent ships to eliminate French ports on Madagascar and in the Seychelles. Due to the length of time it took for communications to travel between the Indian Ocean and Europe however, the French government were still unaware of the fall of the island in February 1811, when a squadron of reinforcements under François Roquebert, with the supplies needed to repair Hamelin's squadron, was despatched to the Indian Ocean. The squadron arrived on 6 May and was almost brought to battle by a British force off Grand Port, before escaping into the western Indian Ocean. Stopping at Tamatave on Madagascar, the French squadron was caught by a British force under Captain Charles Marsh Schomberg on 20 May and defeated. The Battle of Tamatave was characterised by very light winds, which left the combatants becalmed for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> engaging in periodic fighting as the breeze increased.|$|E

5|$|The round ribbontail ray has nocturnal {{habits and}} rests {{motionless}} for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> often near vertical structures, in caves, or under ledges. It may be solitary, or form small to large groups. This ray is frequently shadowed {{by one or}} more jacks or cobia (Rachycentron canadum); these smaller fishes may feed on food stirred up by the ray's activities, or use the ray's body as cover for approaching their own prey. The round ribbontail ray hunts for bivalves, crabs, shrimps, and small bony fishes on the bottom. When feeding, it adopts a characteristic posture in which it presses the margin of its disc against the bottom and takes in water through its spiracles, which it blows through its mouth to uncover prey buried in the sediment. This species may fall prey to larger fishes such as sharks, and marine mammals. When threatened, it raises its tail over its back so that the spine faces forward, and waves it back and forth. Known parasites of this species include the monogenean Dasybatotrema spinosum, Dendromonocotyle pipinna, Neoentobdella garneri and N. taiwanensis, and the nematode Echinocephalus overstreeti.|$|E
5|$|The whitetip reef shark {{is one of}} {{the three}} most common sharks inhabiting the reefs of the Indo-Pacific, the other two being the blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus) and the grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos). The habitat {{preferences}} of this species overlap those of the other two, though it does not tend to frequent very shallow water like the blacktip reef shark, nor the outer reef like the grey reef shark. The whitetip reef shark swims with strong undulations of its body, and unlike other requiem sharks can lie motionless on the bottom and actively pump water over its gills for respiration. This species is most active at night or during slack tide, and spends <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> resting inside caves singly or in small groups, arranged in parallel or stacked atop one another. Off Hawaii, these sharks may be found sheltering inside underwater lava tubes, while off Costa Rica they are often seen lying in the open on sandy flats.|$|E
