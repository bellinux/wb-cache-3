5000|$|Howlin' Wolf {{recorded}} [...] "The Red Rooster" [...] in Chicago in June 1961. The song {{is performed}} as a slow blues {{in the key}} of A. Although Dixon biographer Mitsutoshi Inaba notes it as a twelve-bar blues, {{the changes in the}} first section vary due to extra beats. Lyrically, it follows the classic AAB blues pattern, where two repeated lines are followed by a second. The opening verse echoes Charlie Patton's second verse: I have a little red rooster, too lazy to crow 'fore day (2&times;)Keep everything in the barnyard, upset in every way As with many blues songs, Dixon's lyrics are ambiguous and may be seen on several levels.

25|$|Babies feed {{differently}} {{with artificial}} nipples {{than from a}} breast. With the breast, the infant's tongue massages the <b>milk</b> <b>out</b> rather than sucking, and the nipple does not go as far into the mouth. Drinking from a bottle takes less effort and the milk may come more rapidly, potentially causing the baby to lose desire for the breast. This is called nursing strike, nipple strike or nipple confusion. To avoid this, expressed milk can be given by means such as spoons or cups.|$|R

50|$|An early myth about milk snakes is {{that they}} suck cow udders to get the milk. The myth is entirely false, and is discredited {{by the fact that}} the milk snake does not have the {{physical}} capabilities to suck <b>milk</b> <b>out</b> of a cow. Milk snakes are, however, frequently found in and around barns, making use of their cool and dark environments, and for the easily accessed populations of rodents to feed on. This proximity to barns, and therefore cows, probably gave rise to the myth.|$|R
5000|$|Ganga Sagar (ਗੰਗਾ ਸਾਗਰ), is {{the name}} given to the sacred relic which belonged to the tenth master of Sikhism, Guru Gobind Singh. It is a {{traditional}} copper urn of the 17th century, which weighs approximately half a kilo gram and is less than 1 foot in height. [...] It has about two hundred holes carved throughout {{the rim of the}} base.

50|$|Certain {{techniques}} {{are not allowed}} to be used to enhance the showing ability of the cow of heifer. Setting teats in place with a glue is not allowed. A showman cannot treat an udder with irritant to cause it to swell and match the size of the other teats. However showman can use super glue or some other sealant to seal the end of the teats to prevent the cow from leaking her <b>milk</b> <b>out.</b> The natural color of a cow cannot be altered, and the cow cannot be fed steroids before the show.|$|R

50|$|Mastitis {{typically}} develops {{when the}} milk is not properly {{removed from the}} breast. Milk stasis {{can lead to the}} milk ducts in the breasts becoming blocked, as the breast milk is not being properly and regularly expressed. It has also been suggested that blocked milk ducts can occur as a result of pressure on the breast, such as tight-fitting clothing or an over-restrictive bra, although there is sparse evidence for this supposition.Mastitis may occur when the baby is not appropriately attached to the breast while feeding, when the baby has infrequent feeds or has problems suckling the <b>milk</b> <b>out</b> of the breast.|$|R

25|$|Milk is {{extracted}} from the cow's udder by flexible rubber sheaths known as liners or inflations that are surrounded by a rigid air chamber. A pulsating flow of ambient air and vacuum {{is applied to the}} inflation's air chamber during the milking process. When ambient air is allowed to enter the chamber, the vacuum inside the inflation causes the inflation to collapse around the cow's teat, squeezing the <b>milk</b> <b>out</b> of teat in a similar fashion as a baby calf's mouth massaging the teat. When the vacuum is reapplied in the chamber the flexible rubber inflation relaxes and opens up, preparing for the next squeezing cycle.|$|R
