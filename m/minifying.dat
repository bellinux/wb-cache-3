50|$|In a {{research}} performed by Lorimer Moseley of Oxford University, 10 participants were studied, {{all of whom}} were suffering from chronic pain in their right arms which was intensified by movement. The patients were asked to move their arm under two different conditions: first with a binocular which could magnify body organs, and then with an inverted binocular which could minify them. They also asked to rate their pain they felt when doing so. The result was surprising: there was an obvious relation between the size of organs seen by binocular and the way they felt; the bigger the limbs were seen, the more the pain was. The results become more interesting when it was found that magnifying and <b>minifying</b> with binoculars can even change the extent of swelling.|$|E
5000|$|In {{computer}} graphics, mipmaps (also MIP maps) or pyramids [...] are pre-calculated, optimized {{sequences of}} images, {{each of which}} is a progressively lower resolution representation of the same image. The height and width of each image, or level, in the mipmap is a power of two smaller than the previous level. Mipmaps {{do not have to be}} square. They are intended to increase rendering speed and reduce aliasing artifacts. A high-resolution mipmap image is used for high-density samples, such as for objects close to the camera. Lower-resolution images are used as the object appears farther away. This is a more efficient way of downfiltering (<b>minifying)</b> a texture than sampling all texels in the original texture that would contribute to a screen pixel; it is faster to take a constant number of samples from the appropriately downfiltered textures. Mipmaps are widely used in 3D computer games, flight simulators, other 3D imaging systems for texture filtering and 2D as well as 3D GIS software. Their use is known as mipmapping. The letters [...] "MIP" [...] in the name are an acronym of the Latin phrase multum in parvo, meaning [...] "much in little". Since mipmaps, by definition, are pre-allocated, additional storage space is required to take advantage of them. They are also related to wavelet compression. Mipmap textures are used in 3D scenes to decrease the time required to render a scene. They also improve the scene's realism, at the cost of 1/3 more memory per texture.|$|E

The findings of studies investigating size distortion are inconsistent. The influence {{of the size of the}} reflected hand on embodiment of the mirror reflection is not known. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of magnifying and <b>minifying</b> mirror reflections of the hand on embodiment measured using an eight-item questionnaire and on proprioceptive drift. During the experiment, participants (n[*]=[*] 45) placed their right hand behind a mirror and their left hand in front of a mirror. Participants watched a normal-sized, a magnified and a minified reflection of the left hand while performing synchronised finger movements for 3 min (adaptive phase). Measurements of embodiment were taken before (pre) and after (post) synchronous movements of the fingers of both hands (embodiment adaptive phase). Results revealed larger proprioceptive drift post-adaptive phase (p[*]=[*] 0. 001). Participants agreed more strongly with questionnaire items associated with location, ownership and agency of the reflection of the hand post-adaptive phase (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) and when looking at the normal-sized reflection (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). In conclusion, irrespective of size, watching a reflection of the hand while performing synchronised movements enhances the embodiment of the reflection of the hand. Magnifying and <b>minifying</b> the reflection of the hand has little effect on proprioceptive drift, but it weakens the subjective embodiment experience. Such factors need to be taken into account in future studies using this technique, particularly when assessing mirror {{visual feedback}} for pain management...|$|E

The performances of the devices are demonstrated by finite element simulations. This design provides a more flexible way to shift the scattering of an object, and thus can be expected to have wide applications. Comment: 12 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

40|$|Long-term {{exposure}} to microgravity causes sensorimotor adaptations {{that result in}} functional deficits upon returning to a gravitational environment. At landing, the vestibular system and the central nervous system, responsible for coordinating head and eye movements via the vestibulo-occular reflex (VOR), are adapted to microgravity and must re-adapt to the Earth's gravitational environment. This re-adaptation causes decrements in gaze control and dynamic visual acuity, with astronauts reporting oscillopsia and blurred vision. These effects are caused by retinal slip, or the inability to keep an image focused on their retina, which is thought to drive motion sickness symptoms experienced upon landing. Retinal slip can be estimated by dynamic visual acuity (DVA); visual acuity while in motion. Peters et al. (2011) find that DVA is worsened in astronauts {{by an average of}} 0. 75 eye-chart lines one day after landing. Previously, the use of stroboscopic goggles has shown to be effective in minimizing motion sickness symptoms due to retinal slip (Reschke et al. 2007). In this study, we simulated the decrement in DVA caused by sensorimotor re-adaptation by using <b>minifying</b> lenses and then testing the efficacy of stroboscopic goggles in preventing retinal slip and improving DVA. Dynamic visual acuity is assessed using an oscillating chair developed in the Neuroscience Laboratory at JSC. This chair is motor-driven and oscillates vertically at 2 Hz with a vertical displacement of +/- 2 cm to simulate the vertical translations that occur while walking. As the subject is being oscillated, they are asked to discern the direction of Landolt-C optotypes of varying sizes and record their direction using a gamepad. The visual acuity thresholds are determined using an algorithm that alters the size of the optotype based on the previous responses of the subject using a forced-choice best parameter estimation that is able to rapidly converge on the threshold value. Visual acuity thresholds were determined both for static (seated) and dynamic (oscillating) conditions. Dynamic visual acuity is defined as the difference between the dynamic and static conditions. We found that healthy subjects (n= 20) have a significantly impaired DVA while wearing the <b>minifying</b> lenses, demonstrating that the VOR is in an adaptive state and retinal slip is occurring. When subjects' acuity was tested wearing the stroboscopic goggles with the <b>minifying</b> lenses, {{there was no significant difference}} in their DVA compared to their baseline DVA. This suggests that stroboscopic goggles are preventing retinal slip and would function as an efficient countermeasure for VOR adaptations and thus help mitigate landing sickness symptoms experienced by long-duration crewmembers. These goggles might also be used to counter blurred vision (caused by retinal slip) experienced by crewmembers during launch where the vehicle vibrations are greatest. The stroboscopic effect could be built into a section of their head mounted displays on the visor of their helmets to be used in these high vibration situation if a mission critical task is necessary...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{feeling that}} our body is ours, and is {{constantly}} there, {{is a fundamental}} aspect of self-awareness [1]. Although it is often taken for granted, our physical self-awareness, or body image, is disrupted in many clinical conditions [2] (see also [3] {{for a list of}} such conditions). One common disturbance of body image, in which one limb feels bigger than it really is, can also be induced in healthy volunteers by using local anaesthesia or cutaneous stimulation [4]. Here we report that, in patients with chronic hand pain, magnifying their view of their own limb during movement significantly increases the pain and swelling evoked by movement.

40|$|The {{notion that}} {{apparent}} sizes are perceived {{relative to the}} size of one’s body is supported through the discovery of a new visual illusion. When graspable objects are magnified by magnifying goggles, they appear to shrink back to near-normal size when one’s hand (also magnified) is placed next to them. When objects are “minified” by <b>minifying</b> goggles, the opposite occurs. The rescaling effect also occurred when participants who were trained in tool use viewed the tool next to the objects. However, this change in apparent size does not occur when familiar objects or someone else’s hand is placed next to the magnified or minified object. Presumably, objects’ apparent sizes shift closer to their actual sizes when one’s hand is viewed because objects’ sizes relative to the hand are the same with or without the goggles. These findings highlight the role of body scaling in size perception...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} if adaptive modulation of vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) function is associated with commensurate alterations in manual target localization. To measure the effects of adapted VOR on manual responses we developed the Vestibular-Contingent Pointing Test (VCP). In the VCP test, subjects pointed to a remembered target following passive whole body rotation in the dark. In the first experiment, subjects performed VCP before and after wearing 0. 5 X <b>minifying</b> lenses that adaptively attenuate horizontal VOR gain. Results showed that adaptive reduction in horizontal VOR gain was accompanied by a commensurate change in VCP performance. In the second experiment, bilaterally labyrinthine deficient (LD) subjects were tested to confirm that vestibular cues were central to the spatial coding of both eye and hand movements during VCP. LD subjects performed significantly worse than normal subjects. These results demonstrate that adaptive change in VOR can lead to alterations in manual target localization...|$|E

Using the simple and easily measured paradigm of visual-motor rearrangement {{created by the}} use of visual displacement lenses, we sought to determine whether an individual's ability to adapt to visuo-motor discordance could be improved through training. Subjects threw small balls at a stationary target during a 3 -week practice regimen involving repeated exposure to one set of lenses in block practice (x 2. 0 magnifying lenses), multiple sets of lenses in variable practice (x 2. 0 magnifying, x 0. 5 <b>minifying</b> and up-down reversing lenses) or sham lenses. At the end of training, adaptation to a novel visuo-motor situation (20 -degree right shift lenses) was tested. We found that (1) training with variable practice can increase adaptability to a novel visuo-motor situation, (2) increased adaptability is retained for at least 1 month and is transferable to further novel visuo-motor permutations and (3) variable practice improves performance of a simple motor task even in the undisturbed state. These results have implications for the design of clinical rehabilitation programs and countermeasures to enhance astronaut adaptability, facilitating adaptive transitions between gravitational environments...|$|E

The idea behind this scheme is to implement a ITS which would control mechanically the traffic lights {{in the path of the}} ambulance. The ambulance is controlled by the central unit which furnishes the most scant route to the ambulance and also controls the traffic light according to the ambulance location and thus reaching the hospital safely. The server also determines the location of the accident spot through the sensor systems in the vehicle which encountered the acci-dent and thus the server walks through the ambulance to the spot. This scheme is fully automated, thus it finds the acci-dent spot, controls the traffic lights, helping to reach the hospital in time. ...|$|E
40|$|Optimal human {{performance}} depends upon integrated sensorimotor and cognitive functions, {{both of which}} are known to be exquisitely sensitive to loss of sleep. Under the microgravity conditions of space flight, adaptation of both sensorimotor (especially vestibular) and cognitive functions (especially orientation) must occur quickly [...] and be maintained [...] despite any concurrent disruptions of sleep that may be caused by microgravity itself, or by the uncomfortable sleeping conditions of the spacecraft. It is the three-way interaction between sleep quality, general work efficiency, and sensorimotor integration {{that is the subject of}} this paper and the focus of new work in our laboratory. To record sleep under field conditions including microgravity, we utilize a novel system called the Nightcap that we have developed and extensively tested on normal and sleep-disordered subjects.

40|$|AbstractIntroduction: Two-dimensional (2 D) imaging has {{limitations}} {{in the evaluation}} of three-dimensional (3 D) structures. In recent years, it has become possible to acquire 3 D data of patients. This study sought to evaluate the accuracy of linear measurements of the skull made by cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) technique and digital lateral cephalometry by two newly introduced Galileos and Planmeca machines. Materials and Methods: In this random descriptive/cross-sectional study, seven anatomical landmarks were determined on seven dry human skulls. Direct measurements on the skulls were made with a digital caliper. Then digital cephalometric radiographs and CBCT radiographs were taken. SPSS Ver. 11. 5 software was used for the data analysis. ICC (Intraclass Correlations Coefficients) test and mean percentage differences was calculated. Results: The mean percentage differences between CBCT technique measurements and those made on dry skulls were less than 1 mm, less than 2 mm and 3 mm in 42 %, 42 % and 12 % of variables. These mean differences between measurements lateral cephalometric images and those on dry skulls were less than 5 mm in 42 % of cases and 10 ‒ 16 mm in the remaining 42 %.
