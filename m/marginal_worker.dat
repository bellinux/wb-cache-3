40|$|This study {{explores the}} rise of <b>marginal</b> <b>workers</b> in Britain and Hong Kong after the Second World War and argues that <b>marginal</b> <b>workers</b> are not minor, unimportant, {{powerless}} and transient elements of capitalist development. <b>Marginal</b> <b>workers,</b> however, are important and indispensable {{to the development of}} capitalism in both regions. The work and life histories of <b>marginal</b> <b>workers</b> in Britain and Hong Kong show that gender and ethnic inequalities are articulated through and intensified by class inequality. The overlapping of these inequalities creates different subgroups of <b>marginal</b> <b>workers.</b> The marginalisation of labour is the process of the identification and separation of marginal groups from mainstream society. With assistance from the state, capital has been able to increase its exploitation of and control over labour through intensified gender, ethnic, occupational and international divisions of labour. This thesis argues that marginal is critical. A marginal class location induces a marginal class consciousness, which is a counter, non-conforming and cynical attitude towards oppression and exploitation. Nonetheless, while the consciousness of British <b>marginal</b> <b>workers</b> is more aggressive, radical and well shaped, that of <b>marginal</b> <b>workers</b> in Hong Kong is more self-defensive, conservative and amorphous. This thesis suggests that these different patterns of marginal consciousness are a product of their distinctive class formation process: <b>marginal</b> <b>workers</b> in Britain have undergone a 'sedimentary' class formation, their counterparts in Hong Kong have undergone a 'disrupted' class formation. The 'sedimentary class formation' of <b>marginal</b> <b>workers</b> in Britain is structured by its marginal trap of downward mobility and low geographical mobility at the macro level, alongside active shop-floor struggle and strong trade unionism at the macro level. The 'disrupted class formation' of <b>marginal</b> <b>workers</b> in Hong Kong is caused by its permeable class structure and covert class struggle, alongside the lack of shop-floor trade union organisers and experience of struggle...|$|R

We use a search frictions model with informality, (ex post) heterogeneous workers, and conditional taxes and transfers. In the model, formal jobs are "better" than informal jobs, but harder to get. Taxes are proportional to the wage, while transfers are lump sum, implying a cross-subsidy from high-income to low-income workers. As a result, the <b>marginal</b> <b>worker</b> weighs two opposing forces: changes in taxes vs. changes in transfers. We calibrate the model to Mexico and perform counterfactuals.

30|$|Several {{minimum wage}} studies in Germany are a priori {{based on the}} neoclassical presumption. Assuming that the labor market is close to being a perfect market, and hence the initial {{situation}} is a competitive equilibrium, {{the introduction of a}} wage floor implies a movement along the labor demand curve. It goes without saying that this approach inevitably leads to employment losses if the minimum wage is binding, i.e. above the competitive market equilibrium. In this case the enforced wage level exceeds the marginal productivity evaluated at market prices. As a consequence, employment shrinks until the equilibrium relation between wages and productivity of the <b>marginal</b> <b>worker</b> is re-established. Empirical estimates of the employment effect of minimum wages are then straightforward. All that is needed to calculate the disemployment effect is information on the low tail of the wage distribution and an estimate of the (real) wage elasticity of labor demand.|$|E

The firm’s reliance on quits to extract information relevant {{to the design of}} an efficient mix of wages and working conditions may introduce inefficiencies by focusing on the preferences of the <b>marginal</b> <b>worker</b> rather than those of older, more stable, and potentially more valuable employees.

Under a sufficient condition a maximum effort level (with wages unrestricted will raise employees utility but lower welfare.

40|$|U. S. CPS data {{indicate}} that in recessions firms actually increase their hiring rates from the pools of the unemployed {{and out of the}} labor force. Why so? The paper provides an explanation by studying the optimal recruiting behavior of the representative firm. The model combines labor frictions, of the search and matching type, with capital frictions, of the q-model type. Optimal firm behavior {{is a function of the}} value of jobs, i. e., the expected present value of the <b>marginal</b> <b>worker</b> to the firm. These are estimated to be counter-cyclical, the underlying reason being the dynamic behavior of the labor share of GDP. The counter-cyclicality of hiring rates and job values, which may appear counter-intuitive, is shown to be consistent with well-known business cycle facts. The analysis emphasizes the difference between current labor productivity and the wider, forwardlooking concept of job values. The paper explains the high volatility of firm recruiting behavior, as well as the reduction over time in labor market fluidity in the U. S., using the same estimated model. Part of the explanation has to do with job values and another part with the interaction of hiring and investment costs, both determinants having been typically overlooked...|$|E
