25|$|A forging press, {{often just}} called a press, {{is used for}} press forging. There are two main types: {{mechanical}} and hydraulic presses. Mechanical presses function by using cams, cranks and/or toggles to produce a preset (a predetermined force at a certain location in the stroke) and reproducible stroke. Due {{to the nature of}} this type of system, different forces are available at different stroke positions. Mechanical presses are faster than their hydraulic counterparts (up to 50 strokes per minute). Their capacities range from 3 to 160 MN (300 to 18,000 short tons-force). Hydraulic presses use fluid pressure and a piston to generate force. The advantages of a hydraulic press over a <b>mechanical</b> <b>press</b> are its flexibility and greater capacity. The disadvantages include a slower, larger, and costlier machine to operate.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} styles of <b>mechanical</b> <b>press,</b> these can range from a simple wooden basket with vertical slats and a capstan providing pressure to large hydraulic presses that can even be enclosed to prevent exposure oxygen. An advantage of this style of press is the usually gentle means that it presses the grape but its disadvantages includes the labor intensiveness of its use, small volumes and tendency to provide uneven pressure to {{all parts of the}} cake as well as usually exposing the must to significant amounts of oxygen. Another disadvantage from a time perspective but an advantage in other regards such as gentleness, is that by its nature pressing with a basket press is very slow. Applying too much pressure too rapidly can break the press.|$|E

2500|$|Solid samples can be {{prepared}} {{in a variety of}} ways. One common method is to crush the sample with an oily mulling agent (usually mineral oil Nujol). A thin film of the mull is applied onto salt plates and measured. The second method is to grind a quantity of the sample with a specially purified salt (usually potassium bromide) finely (to remove scattering effects from large crystals). This powder mixture is then pressed in a <b>mechanical</b> <b>press</b> to form a translucent pellet through which the beam of the spectrometer can pass. [...] A third technique is the [...] "cast film" [...] technique, which is used mainly for polymeric materials. The sample is first dissolved in a suitable, non hygroscopic solvent. A drop of this solution is deposited on surface of KBr or NaCl cell. The solution is then evaporated to dryness and the film formed on the cell is analysed directly. Care is important to ensure that the film is not too thick otherwise light cannot pass through. This technique is suitable for qualitative analysis. The final method is to use microtomy to cut a thin (20–100µm) film from a solid sample. This {{is one of the most}} important ways of analysing failed plastic products for example because the integrity of the solid is preserved.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Based on {{analysis}} of press working characteristics, {{some of the}} main kinematics requirements for working mechanisms of servo <b>mechanical</b> <b>presses</b> were put forward: fast in empty stroke, slow and uniform in working stroke and big force gain. Crank link and knuckle-straight link are the most common working mechanisms in <b>mechanical</b> <b>presses.</b> To meet the requirement of servo <b>mechanical</b> <b>presses,</b> another mechanism, knuckle-triangle link, was designed. The kinematics simulations of the three mechanisms for a 1600 kN press were conducted by dynamic software ADAMS. Knuckle-triangle link had the most uniform and lowest slide’s average velocity and biggest force gain within the working stroke. For the same nominal pressure of 1600 kN, the required input torque of knuckle-triangle link was 9108 Nm. In comparison with crank link and knuckle-straight link, the crank’s input torque was reduced by 84 % and 76 % respectively without considering the influence of friction and inertia. In conclusion, knuckle-triangle link mechanism is more suitable for large-tonnage servo presses...|$|R

40|$|Mechanical {{extraction}} from seeds {{represents an}} important {{process in the}} production of vegetable oils. The efficiency of this step can {{have an effect on the}} economic convenience of the entire production chain of vegetable oils. However, the <b>mechanical</b> <b>presses</b> used for extraction are designed following criteria based more on the experience and intuition of the operators than on rigorous analyses of the physical principles involved in the process. In this study we have tested the possibility of applying a mathematical model that reproduces oil extraction from seeds, on a laboratory type of continuous press. In other words, we have compared the results of our mathematical model with those obtained from real extractions with <b>mechanical</b> <b>presses</b> on sunflower seeds. Our model is based on determining the main operating parameters of mechanical extraction, such as temperature, pressure and compression time, and on the knowledge of some physical characteristics of the solid matrix of the seeds. The results obtained are interesting because they include the role of operating parameters involved in extraction while the application of the mathematical model studied here allows, although with potential for improvement, a mathematical instrument to be developed for optimising the sizing and the operating conditions of <b>mechanical</b> <b>presses...</b>|$|R

50|$|On the contrary, Hydraulic Presses do {{not have}} a tonnage curve and can produce full tonnage at any point in the stroke.

5000|$|Coining is a {{cold working}} process similar in other respects to forging, which takes place at {{elevated}} temperature; it uses {{a great deal of}} force to plastically deform a workpiece, so it conforms to a die.
