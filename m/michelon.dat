5000|$|The final suite {{is mostly}} in E major, {{with only the}} second {{movement}} and the middle section of the final movement in E minor. La Brillante is certainly a “Brilliant" [...] opening piece. Almost all {{of the first three}} sections (rondeau theme and first two couplets) are written in the bright upper range of the harpsichord, both staves requiring treble clef. La Dampiere is a dramatic sarabande reminiscent of François Couperin's La Ténébreuse and La Raphaéle. La <b>Michelon</b> is a lively, joyful Italian giga. La Jeunesse (“Youth”) is a menuet. Chaconne is in E major, but has an extended middle section in the parallel mode of E minor. The form is built of groups of four measures which are immediately repeated for a total of eight in each unit. The chaconne in this collection comes a close second to one by Jacques Duphly (1715-1789) as the longest single, continuous Piéce de clavecin of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.|$|E

The multiple systems framework (Zacks & <b>Michelon,</b> 2005) proposes that different transformations can be distinguished in terms of which of several spatial reference frames is updated. Two types of transformation are particularly important for human spatial reasoning. In an object-based transformation, an object-centered reference frame moves relative to the viewer’s egocentric reference frame and the environment-centered frame. In a perspective transformation, the observer’s egocentric reference frame moves relative to environment-centered and object-centered reference frames...|$|E

Golimumab is a new tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist recently approved by the FDA for controlling {{signs and symptoms of}} psoriatic arthritis. In a Phase III clinical trial in patients with PsA, patients receiving golimumab showed significant improvement in the signs and symptoms of disease. It was usually well tolerated, but adverse events generally occurred more in patients receiving golimumab compared to placebo. Golimumab has also recently shown efficacy in slowing structural damage in PsA. This new biologic therapy provides physicians with another option in the treatment of this inflammatory arthritis while offering patients certain advantages over other TNF antagonists.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} lattice based language models, a {{new language}} modeling paradigm. These models construct multi-dimensional hierarchies of partitions and select the most promising partitions to generate the estimated distributions. We discussed a specific two dimensional lattice and propose two primary features to measure the usefulness of each node: the training-set history count and the smoothed entropy of its prediction. Smoothing techniques are reviewed and a generalization of the conventional backoff strategy to multiple dimensions is proposed. Preliminary experimental results are obtained on the SWITCHBOARD corpus which lead to a 6. 5 % perplexity reduction over a word trigram model.

The flow is described by 3 D incompressible Navier-Stokes system with a nonlinear viscosity, being a power of a norm of the shear rate (power law). We {{consider the}} limit when ffl ! 0 and prove that the limit averaged velocity, averaged over the thickness, satisfies a nonlinear two-dimensional Poiseuille's law, with non-linear viscosity depending {{on the power of}} the length of the gradient of the pressure. It is found out that the powers in the starting law and in the limit law are conjugate.

40|$|Processes for perspective-taking can be {{differentiated}} {{on whether}} or not they require us to mentally rotate ourselves into the position of the other person (<b>Michelon</b> & Zacks, 2006). Until now, only two perspective-taking tasks have been differentiated in this way, showing that judging whether something is to someone’s left or right does require mental rotation, but judging if someone can see something or not does not. These tasks differ firstly on whether the content of the perspective is visual or spatial and secondly on whether the type of the judgement is early-developing (level- 1 type) or later-developing (level- 2 type). Across two experiments, we tested which of these factors was likely to be most important by using four different perspective-taking tasks which crossed orthogonally the content of judgement (visual vs. spatial) and the type of judgement (level- 1 type vs. level- 2 type). We found that the level- 2 type judgements, of how something looks to someone else and whether it is to their left or right, required egocentric mental rotation. On the other hand, level- 1 type judgements, of whether something was in front of or behind someone and of whether someone could see something or not, did not involve mental rotation. We suggest from this that the initial processing strategies employed for perspective-taking are largely independent of whether judgements are visual or spatial in nature. Furthermore, early developing abilities have features that make mental rotation unnecessary...|$|E
40|$|In addition, {{studies on}} motor {{preparation}} {{have shown that}} the instruction to later execute a particular movement results in increased activation of brain areas such as dorsal pre-motor cortex (PMd) and primary motor cortex (M 1) (Riehle and Requin, 1989; Toni et al., 1999; Crammond and Kalaska, 2000; Cisek et al., 2003; Zang et al., 2003; Churchland et al., 2006). Instruction-related changes in activation have also been found in the thalamus (<b>Michelon</b> et al., 2006), the supplementary motor area (SMA), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; Nagai et al., 2004), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC; Ikeda et al., 1996), and the putamen (Alexander and Crutcher, 1990; Jaeger et al., 1993). Interestingly, single-cell recordings showed that cortical activation precedes activation in the putamen, suggesting that the preparatory activity in the putamen might be caused by input from M 1 and SMA (Alexander and Crutcher, 1990; Mink, 1996). Here we present an functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in people were given cues that provided probabilis-tic information about the direction of movement of an upcoming random dot display (i. e., 90 %, 70 %, or 50 % valid). At a behavioral level, we anticipated that the effect of this manipulation would be to bias people’s decision criteria, a prediction that we verifi ed by fi tting a quantitative model to the behavioral data. At a neural level, we anticipated that the effect of the manipulation would be to acti-vate subcortical, striatal areas involved in motor planning and action preparation (Mink, 1996; Draganski et al., 2008; Utter and Basso, 2008). In addition, we anticipated that this striatal activation would be accompanied by activation in cortical control areas such as DLPF...|$|E
40|$|First, we {{proposed}} a scenario model which minimizes a regret function, and a 2 -step approach to solve the scenario model. The 2 -step approach generates a policy which is solution and model robust. We implemented the method for two financial models. The first model determines a portfolio which tracks the indices of mortgage backed securities. We used real data to test the 2 -step approach. The {{results show that the}} portfolio tracks the indices very well and outperforms the indices. The second model is a financial trading model, which is also a multistage full recourse model. We solved it using the 2 -step approach with randomly generated data. The model is solved for two different sizes of scenarios. The method had not been tested or implemented before. ^ Second, we developed two models for check sorting and clearing. There was no previous published work done in modelling both sorting and clearing decisions, as far as we know. The two models were tested using three sets of pilot data. We found that the second model is better than the first model. We obtained a data set covering the Chicago area and generated a national data set based on it. We presented computational results for both sets of data and performed some sensitivity analysis. Due {{to the nature of the}} model, it is difficult to use the optimal solution if the data change. However, we recommend two possible ways of finding more flexible sorting and clearing decisions. ^ Third, we designed an algorithm to solve a primal relaxation problem for linear and nonlinear mixed integer problems, introduced by <b>Michelon</b> and Maculan (1992) in the linear case, and by Guignard and Contesse (1995) in the nonlinear case. The algorithm combines a simplicial decomposition method and a proximal augmented Lagrangean method. It was tested for both nonlinear and linear capacitated plant location problems, and we found that it was successful in computing optimal Lagrangean bounds for a range of parameter values. ...|$|E
