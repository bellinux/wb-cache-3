5|$|By the 1930s, necklines plunged at the back, sleeves {{disappeared}} and sides were cut away and tightened. With {{the development of}} new clothing materials, particularly latex and nylon, through the 1930s swimsuits gradually began hugging the body, with shoulder straps that could be lowered for tanning. Women's swimwear of the 1930s and 1940s incorporated increasing degrees of <b>midriff</b> exposure. Coco Chanel made suntans fashionable, and in 1932 French designer Madeleine Vionnet offered an exposed <b>midriff</b> in an evening gown. They were seen a year later in Gold Diggers of 1933. The Busby Berkeley film Footlight Parade of 1932 showcases aquachoreography that featured bikinis. Dorothy Lamour's The Hurricane (1937) also showed two-piece bathing suits.|$|E
5|$|When Dave Rosten, another Sydney evangelist, {{attempted}} to imitate Jenner's method of evangelism, he was {{punched in the}} <b>midriff</b> by the first person he spoke to, so he decided that Jenner's approach to evangelism was not for others to emulate. In 1947, Jenner asked his question to a man named Angus Carruthers, who responded {{that he was a}} Christian and going to heaven. Jenner invited Carruthers back to his home, where Carruthers met Jenner's daughter, Ann. Carruthers and Ann married three years later.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{types of}} {{underwear}} {{are described as}} bikini underwear and designed for men and women. For women, bikini or bikini-style underwear is underwear that is similar in size and form to a regular bikini. It can refer to virtually any undergarment that provides less coverage to the <b>midriff</b> than traditional underwear, panties or knickers, especially suited to clothing such as crop tops. For men, bikini briefs are undergarments that are smaller and more revealing than men's regular briefs. Men's bikini briefs can be low- or high-side that are usually lower than true waist, often at hips, and usually have no access pouch or flap, legs bands at tops of thighs. String bikini briefs have front and rear sections that meet in the crotch {{but not at the}} waistband, with no fabric {{on the side of the}} legs.|$|E

5|$|As Messi {{evolved from}} the team's {{symbolic}} captain into a genuine leader, he led Argentina to the knockout stage as group winners. In the quarter-final, they created numerous chances, including a rebound header by Messi, but were repeatedly denied by Colombia's goalkeeper, and ultimately ended the match scoreless, leading to a 5–4 penalty shootout in their favour. At the semi-final stage, Messi excelled as playmaker as he provided three assists and helped create three more goals in his side's 6–1 victory over Paraguay, receiving applause from the initially hostile crowd. Argentina started the final as the odds-on title favourites, but were defeated by Chile 4–1 in a penalty shootout after an 0–0 extra-time draw. Faced with aggression from opposing players, including taking a boot to the <b>midriff,</b> Messi played below his standards, though {{he was the only}} Argentine to successfully convert his penalty. At the close of the tournament, he was reportedly selected to receive the Most Valuable Player award but rejected the honour. As Argentina continued a trophy drought that began in 1993, the World Cup and Copa América defeats again brought intense criticism for Messi from Argentine media and fans.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United brought Giggs on at {{the start}} of extra time, the Welshman taking Fletcher's place in the midfield. They {{immediately}} tried to play him in down the left wing, but the pass was over-hit and went beyond Giggs. Arsenal finally got their first shot on target in the seventh minute of extra time, when a Van Persie free kick – awarded for a foul by Silvestre – forced a diving save from Carroll. Four minutes later, Manchester United appealed for a penalty kick when a cross from Giggs struck Cole, but replays showed that the ball hit the Arsenal full-back in the <b>midriff.</b> United sustained their attack, and the ball came to Scholes in the penalty area, but his shot on the turn was well saved by Lehmann. The resultant corner was taken short by Scholes, before it was played back to him; his cross found Van Nistelrooy unmarked in the area, but the Dutchman headed over the bar {{from the edge of the}} goal area. United then had another penalty shout when Giggs volleyed a long ball from Scholes into Touré's body and up onto the Ivorian's hand, but referee Rob Styles turned their claims down. Arsenal then brought on Edu to replace Pirès for the remaining 15 minutes.|$|E
5|$|To the south, HMS Bellerophon was {{in serious}} trouble as the huge {{broadside}} of Orient pounded the ship. At 19:50 the mizzenmast and main mast both collapsed and fires broke out simultaneously at several points. Although the blazes were extinguished, the ship had suffered more than 200 casualties. Captain Darby recognised that his position was untenable and ordered the anchor cables cut at 20:20. The battered ship drifted away from the battle under continued fire from Tonnant as the foremast collapsed as well. Orient had also suffered significant damage and Admiral Brueys had been struck in the <b>midriff</b> by a cannonball that almost cut him in half. He died fifteen minutes later, remaining on deck and refusing to be carried below. Orients captain, Luc-Julien-Joseph Casabianca, was also wounded, struck in the face by flying debris and knocked unconscious, while his twelve-year-old son had a leg torn off by a cannonball as he stood beside his father. The most southerly British ship, Majestic, had become briefly entangled with the 80-gun Tonnant, and in the resulting battle, suffered heavy casualties. Captain George Blagdon Westcott was among the dead, killed by French musket fire. Lieutenant Robert Cuthbert assumed command and successfully disentangled his ship, allowing the badly damaged Majestic to drift further southwards so that by 20:30 it was stationed between Tonnant and the next in line, Heureux, engaging both. To support the centre, Captain Thompson of Leander abandoned the futile efforts to drag the stranded Culloden off the shoal and sailed down the embattled French line, entering the gap created by the drifting Peuple Souverain and opening a fierce raking fire on Franklin and Orient.|$|E
50|$|A bra bomb is a bomb worn {{by women}} suicide bombers. Hiding the {{explosives}} in a bra {{instead of a}} vest allows for the women to show their <b>midriffs</b> when searched.

50|$|Czech-born writer Milan Kundera in {{his recent}} book The Festival of Insignificance conveys about the eroticism of exposed female navels. Alain, one of the {{characters}} in the book, observes to his friend how most of the young women in Paris wear T-shirts or blouses that expose their <b>midriffs,</b> displaying their navels for all to see. The navel has become, in effect, the new locus of desire.|$|R
50|$|Wartime {{production}} during World War II required {{vast amounts}} of cotton, silk, nylon, wool, leather, and rubber. In 1942, the United States War Production Board issued Regulation L-85, cutting the use of natural fibers in clothing and mandating a 10% reduction {{in the amount of}} fabric in women's beachwear. To comply with the regulations, swimsuit manufacturers produced two-piece suits with bare <b>midriffs.</b> The fabric shortage continued for some time {{after the end of the}} war.|$|R
25|$|The {{traditional}} Kandyan (osaria) style {{consists of}} a full blouse which covers the <b>midriff</b> completely and is partially tucked in at the front. However, modern intermingling of styles has led to most wearers baring the <b>midriff.</b> The final tail of the sari is neatly pleated rather than free-flowing. This is rather similar to the pleated rosette used in the Dravidian style noted earlier in the article.|$|E
25|$|The ancient Sanskrit work, Kadambari by Banabhatta {{and ancient}} Tamil poetry, {{such as the}} Silappadhikaram, {{describes}} women in exquisite drapery or sari. In ancient India, although women wore saris that bared the <b>midriff,</b> the Dharmasastra writers stated that women should be dressed such that the navel would never become visible. By which for some time the navel exposure became a taboo and the navel was concealed. In ancient Indian tradition and the Natya Shastra (an ancient Indian treatise describing ancient dance and costumes), the navel of the Supreme Being {{is considered to be}} the source of life and creativity, hence the <b>midriff</b> is to be left bare by the sari.|$|E
25|$|Modern women's swimsuits are {{generally}} skintight, covering the pubic {{region and the}} breasts (See bikini). Women's swimwear may also cover the <b>midriff</b> as well.

5000|$|Through the mid-1930s, {{the natural}} {{waistline}} was {{often accompanied by}} emphasis on an empire line. Short bolero jackets, capelets, and dresses cut with fitted <b>midriffs</b> or seams below the bust increased the focus on breadth at the shoulder. By the late 1930s, emphasis was moving to the back, with halter necklines and high-necked but backless evening gowns with sleeves. [...] Evening gowns with matching jackets were worn to the theatre, nightclubs, and elegant restaurants.|$|R

30|$|For both men’s and women’s costumes, raters {{agreed that}} the middle portion of the costume covered the body (lower torso, lower upper torso), such {{that there were no}} gender {{differences}} for those areas. This may be related to current fashion trends, which currently do not feature uncovered mid-torsos. Assuming that Halloween costume designs are influenced by fashion, we might have found gender differences had we conducted this research 15 – 20  years ago, when low-slung jeans, exposed <b>midriffs,</b> and thong underwear were popular for women (Kuczynski, 2004).|$|R
25|$|Over {{the course}} of their next few appearances, the Daleks {{developed}} time travel in The Chase (1965), where they use a time machine to pursue the TARDIS crew, before landing on the planet Mechanus and battling the robotic Mechanoids.

25|$|The word in {{its current}} pejorative usage is {{recorded}} by the Oxford English Dictionary as first used in a Usenet forum in 1998 and first used in a newspaper in 2002. By 2005 the term had become widespread in its use as {{to refer to a}} type of anti-social, uncultured youth, who wear a lot of flashy jewellery, white trainers, baseball caps, and sham designer clothes; the girls expose a lot of <b>midriff.</b>|$|E

These included Plowman maritime missions, Humidor psychological operations, Timberwork agent operations, and <b>Midriff</b> air missions.|$|E
5000|$|Low-rise {{clothing}} {{started in}} the early 1990s, when the British magazine The Face featured Kate Moss in low-rise jeans on its March 1993 issue cover. Models such as Gisele Bündchen frequently flash their <b>midriffs.</b> In 1994, Art Cooper, editor-in-chief of GQ magazine said that his big seller in 1994 was the February issue with Geena Davis on the cover, on which she wore an Armani suit opened at the hips to reveal her navel, It sold about 400,000 copies. He stated, [...] "Part of the success is the navel factor. I think the belly button is really an erogenous zone." ...|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, the heroin chic era had run its course. Teen-inspired {{clothing}} infiltrated mainstream fashion, teen pop music {{was on the}} rise, and artists such as Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera popularized pleather and bare <b>midriffs.</b> As fashion changed to a more youthful demographic, the models who rose to fame had to be sexier for the digital age. Following Gisele Bundchen's breakthrough, a wave of Brazilian models including Adriana Lima, Alessandra Ambrosio, and Ana Beatriz Barros rose to fame on runways and became popular in commercial modelling throughout the 2000s. Some attribute this to decisions by magazines to replace models with celebrities their covers.|$|R
50|$|Women are {{required}} to wear the following to class and chapel: a modest dress, skirt, pants, or jeans with a modest blouse and most types of shoes (sneakers, dress shoes, sandals, etc.).

25|$|Nivi drape {{starts with}} {{one end of}} the sari tucked into the {{waistband}} of the petticoat, usually a plain skirt. The cloth is wrapped around the lower body once, then hand-gathered into even pleats below the navel. The pleats are tucked into the waistband of the petticoat. They create a graceful, decorative effect which poets have likened to the petals of a flower. After one more turn around the waist, the loose end is draped over the shoulder. The loose end is called the pallu, pallav, seragu, or paita depending on the language. It is draped diagonally in front of the torso. It is worn across the right hip to over the left shoulder, partly baring the <b>midriff.</b> The navel can be revealed or concealed by the wearer by adjusting the pallu, depending on the social setting. The long end of the pallu hanging {{from the back of the}} shoulder is often intricately decorated. The pallu may be hanging freely, tucked in at the waist, used to cover the head, or used to cover the neck, by draping it across the right shoulder as well. Some nivi styles are worn with the pallu draped from the back towards the front, coming from the back over the right shoulder with one corner tucked by the left hip, covering the torso/waist. The nivi sari was popularised through the paintings of Raja Ravi Varma. In one of his paintings, the Indian subcontinent was shown as a mother wearing a flowing nivi sari. The ornaments generally accepted by the Hindu culture that can be worn in the <b>midriff</b> region are the waist chains. They are considered to be a part of bridal jewellery.|$|E
25|$|While the sari {{is typical}} to South Asian {{traditional}} wear, clothing worn by South-East Asian countries like Myanmar, Malaysia, the Philippines, Cambodia, Thailand and Laos resemble it, where a long rectangular {{piece of cloth}} is draped around the body. These {{are different from the}} sari as they are wrapped around the lower-half of body as a skirt, worn with a shirt/blouse and resemble a sarong, as seen in the Burmese Longyi, Filipino Malong and Tapis, Laotian Xout lao and Suea pat, Thai Sbai and Sinh, Cambodian Sampot and Timorese Tais. Saris, worn predominantly in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Nepal are usually draped with one end of the cloth fastened around the waist, and the other end placed over the shoulder baring the <b>midriff.</b>|$|E
50|$|Around 1930, {{the costumes}} changed yet again {{to be more}} {{revealing}} and more traditional. Hibiscus bark became the standard material for grass skirts, men no longer wore pants underneath, and women started showing their <b>midriffs.</b> The dress also changed according to type of musical accompaniment. For compositions using drums and membranophones, natural materials were used. They were called Le Grande Costume. For more modern compositions that featured the ukulele and guitar, costumes were called Costume en Tissue and were made out of pareu material that did not exceed two yards in length. At this time, there was a mass movement to keep the island of Tahiti and surrounding areas traditional in their culture.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, the President of Indonesia Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono {{spoke out}} against exposed navels, saying, [...] "Indonesian women, who {{are known for their}} courtesy, should refrain from exposing their <b>midriffs</b> or belly buttons, which now seems to be taken for granted. There are many ways to express beauty, as part of aesthetics, and to express freedom but not by showing things that lead to pornography." [...] He further added that while the state could not dictate dress codes, {{citizens}} were expected to respect the country's moral values and courtesy. A week later, a cabinet minister quoted Yudhoyono as saying that he felt [...] "disturbed and uneasy" [...] to see television shows in which women exposed their navels.|$|R
