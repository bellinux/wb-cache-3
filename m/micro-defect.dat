To measure the current-voltage (I-V) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics, we have manufactured the test structures with an upper (field) Al electrode (Ø 3  mm). The C-V characteristics were measured using the Agilent Technology Analyzer 4294 A (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) at 500  kHz. Such a frequency is considered adequate {{to evade the}} impact of the surface electronic states on the capacitance charging/discharging processes. Thus, the appearance of additional peaks in the C-V characteristic may only be caused by the carrier exchange among the local states in the Si crystal. Special test structures with the surface oxide thickness of approximately 30  nm were manufactured to investigate the influence of temperature on the C-V parameters. The resulting doping level due to thermal donor center presence was determined from a surface resistance measured by the 4 -probe method.

Fractographic analysis of the fracture surface of the specimen revealed that at the beginning of a fracture process a QC crack was developed at the site of a <b>micro-defect,</b> such as a non-metallic inclusion inherent in the engineering materials, and grew to critical size, triggering the fatal unstable growth of an IG crack, involving a change of the propagation mode from QC to IG cracking. A particular fracture toughness value associated with hydrogen degradation can be obtained from the event of unstable growth of an IG crack during the fracture test. This fracture toughness value, KIH, can be explained as the critical condition for the onset of unstable growth of an IG crack or crack growth resistance of the hydrogen-damaged grain boundary. The generality of the statement was confirmed by further experiments employing a specially prepared unnotched specimen, having a fatigue precrack that triggered the onset of IG crack growth in the same manner as the QC crack. Furthermore, the discussion is extended to the essential nature of the hydrogen assisted fracture process by comparing the cracking behaviour in notched and unnotched specimens...|$|E
40|$|In this work, an {{adaptive}} remeshing scheme {{is presented in}} order to simulate with accuracy sheet metal forming processes. During simulations of metal forming processes, large plastic deformations with ductile damage occur and severe mesh distortion takes place after a few incremental steps. Hence frequent remeshing of the part must be performed in order {{to carry out the}} finite element analysis. The necessary steps to remesh the damaged structure during the simulation of the sheet metal forming process are given. The adaptive remeshing based on refinement and coarsening techniques, is controlled by geometrical and physical size maps. This remeshing strategy has been coupled with a projection method in order to avoid problems of contact between the part and the rigid tools. The influence of the remeshing is studied on numerical examples which show the capacity of the proposed procedure.

From this data, one can see that mathematically, under typical pressure differentials generated in food packages (≤ ± 34. 5 kPa), a leak will never start through a 2 µm defect. The calculated leak rates were compared to calculated evaporation rates. The evaporation rate exceeds the leak rate at lower sized microholes (2, and 5 µm diameter) under typical pressure differentials found in food packages. If the liquid, typically aqueous in food products, is evaporating off faster than the leak itself, then there will be solids left behind that could effectively plug the leak. The critical leak size is the size <b>micro-defect</b> that allows microbial penetration into the package. The critical leak size of air-filled defects was found to be 7 µm at all pressures tested.

Non-uniform distribution of the transport current among the strands is lively discussed as a possible cause. In order to investigate current distribution phenomena, a comprehensive model has been developed for the coupled analysis of electromagnetic and thermo-hydraulic proc-esses in forced-flow cooled superconducting multi-strand cables. The model has been implemented in PSpice. While this work is focused on cable-in-conduit conductors (CICCs), the technique can readily be adapted to other types of superconducting multi-strand conductors or to multi-filamentary composites. In this article we report on the reproduction of experimental results to verify the model, which showed very good agreement.

Data points from the mechanical testing were taken after secondary reflow and after accelerated ageing or High Temperature Storage Levelling (HTSL) at 150 deg. C, for various time intervals. A cross reference was also made with solder joints aged solely in ambient. To understand the failure mechanism associated in the fracture of the solder ball joint, the microstructure was examined Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Electron Dispersive X-Ray (EDX) techniques. Information was gathered on the mechanisms that have occurred during solder joint formation and ageing, which can directly contribute to the strength of the solder joint.

In this paper we have considered the problem of automatic visual inspection of <b>micro-defects</b> including pinholes, scratches and particles in patterned Thin Film Transistor-Liquid Crystal Display (TFT-LCD) panel surfaces. For large-sized TFT-LCD panel inspection, high resolution line scan is demanded. We propose a global 1 -D Fourier-based image reconstruction scheme that directly works on the 1 -D line images, instead of the traditional 2 -D area images. The proposed method fully utilizes the inherent geometric structure of a TFT-LCD panel. It first eliminates the frequency components that represent the periodic pattern of a TFT-LCD line image in the 1 -D Fourier spectrum, and then back-transforms the 1 -D Fourier-domain image to the 1 -D spatial domain image using the inverse Fourier transform. The Fourier reconstruction process can effectively remove the patterned background and distinctly preserve local anomalies in the resulting 1 -D image. Wavelet decomposition is further applied to remove uneven illumination in the filtered image so that defects can be easily segmented with simple statistical control limits.

40|$|AbstractAn {{extended}} displacement discontinuity method (EDDM) {{is proposed}} {{to analyze the}} stress wave propagation in jointed viscoelastic rock mass (VRM). The discontinuities in a rock mass are divided into two groups. The primary group with an average geometrical size larger than or {{in the same order}} of magnitude of wavelength of a concerned stress wave is defined as “macro-joints”, while the secondary group with a high density and relatively small geometrical size compared to the wavelength is known as “micro-defects”. The rock mass with <b>micro-defects</b> is modeled as an equivalent viscoelastic medium while the macro-joints in the rock mass are modeled explicitly as physical discontinuities. Viscoelastic properties of a <b>micro-defected</b> sedimentary rock are obtained by longitudinally impacting a cored long sedimentary rod with a pendulum. Wave propagation coefficient and dynamic viscoelastic modulus are measured. The EDDM is then successfully employed to analyze the wave propagation across macro-joint in VRM. The effect of the rock viscosity on the stress wave propagation is evaluated by comparing the results of VRM from the presented EDDM with those of an elastic rock mass (ERM) from the conventional displacement discontinuity method (CDDM). The CDDM is a special case of the EDDM under the condition that the rock viscosity is ignored. Comparison of the reflected and transmitted waves shows that the essential rock viscosity has a significant effect on stress wave attenuation.
