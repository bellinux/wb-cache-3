President, Congress, Constellation, and Essex prepared to sail {{as soon as}} possible under the direction of Commodore Samuel Barron. Barron selected President as his flagship, but she required a new bowsprit and repairs to her masts and rigging. Some two <b>months</b> <b>passed</b> before the squadron was ready to sail. They departed in late June and arrived at Gibraltar on 12August.|$|E
5|$|Rabaul fell within MacArthur's area, but {{the initial}} {{operations}} in the southern Solomon Islands came under Nimitz. The Japanese reaction to Task One, the seizure of {{the southern part of}} the Solomon Islands, was more violent than anticipated and some <b>months</b> <b>passed</b> before the Guadalcanal Campaign was brought to a successful conclusion. Meanwhile, General MacArthur's forces fought off a series of Japanese offensives in Papua in the Kokoda Track campaign, Battle of Milne Bay, Battle of Buna–Gona, the Battle of Wau and the Battle of the Bismarck Sea.|$|E

5|$|As the <b>months</b> <b>passed,</b> and the privations in Constantinople increased, the pro-Kantakouzenos faction in {{the capital}} grew as the Empress refused even to {{consider}} negotiations. Twice agents were sent to assassinate Kantakouzenos, but they failed. The Empress eventually fell out with Patriarch John Kalekas, who was deposed in a synod on 2 February 1347. On the same night, supporters of Kantakouzenos opened the disused Golden Gate, and Kantakouzenos entered the city with 1,000 men. Meeting no resistance, his troops surrounded the Palace of Blachernae, the imperial residence, the next morning, but the Empress refused to surrender for several days, still fearful of the fate that awaited her. Kantakouzenos' men grew impatient and stormed part of the palace complex, and John V persuaded his mother to accept a settlement.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{scheduling}} issues, Rucka and Lark {{were behind}} on the series from the start. After several late issues, the team announced a four-month hiatus between issues 21 and 22 to allow Lark {{to get ahead of}} schedule. They said they would not solicit any additional issues until the next story arc was completed, and the hiatus actually lasted six months, in part because of miscommunication between Image Comics and Diamond Distribution. During the hiatus, they released a sourcebook providing additional, non-essential background on the Carlyle family. Despite the break, five <b>months</b> <b>passed</b> between the fourth and fifth chapters of the Cull arc. A second sourcebook detailing the Hock Family was released in April 2017.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was {{contracted}} {{to finish the}} edition in 18 months but as the <b>months</b> <b>passed,</b> his pace slowed. He told Charles Burney in December 1757 {{that it would take}} him until the following March to complete it. Before that could happen, in February 1758 he was arrested again for an unpaid debt of £40. The debt was soon repaid by Tonson, who had contracted Johnson to publish the work; this motivated Johnson to finish the edition to repay the favour. Although it took him another seven years to finish, Johnson completed a few volumes of his Shakespeare to prove his commitment to the project.|$|E

5|$|Johnson's work on The Plays of William Shakespeare took {{up most of}} his time. On 8 June 1756, Johnson {{published}} his Proposals for Printing, by Subscription, the Dramatick Works of William Shakespeare, which argued that previous editions of Shakespeare were edited incorrectly {{and needed to be}} corrected. Johnson's progress on the work slowed as the <b>months</b> <b>passed,</b> and he told music historian Charles Burney in December 1757 that it would take him until the following March to complete it. Before that could happen, he was arrested again, for a debt of £40, in February 1758. The debt was soon repaid by Jacob Tonson, who had contracted Johnson to publish Shakespeare, and this encouraged Johnson to finish his edition to repay the favour. Although it took him another seven years to finish, Johnson completed a few volumes of his Shakespeare to prove his commitment to the project.|$|E
5|$|In 1869 {{the island}} was visited by a {{magistrate}} P. Cloete aboard the Thetis investigating a possible murder. He was accompanied by Charles Moore, director of the Botanic Gardens in Sydney, and his assistant William Carron who forwarded plant specimens to Ferdinand Mueller at the botanic gardens in Melbourne who, by 1875, had catalogued and published 195 species. Also on the ship was William Fitzgerald, a surveyor, and Mr Masters from the Australian Museum. Together they surveyed the island with the findings published in 1870 when the population was listed as 35 people, their 13 houses built of split palm battens thatched {{on the roof and}} sides with palm leaves. At about this time there began a downturn of trade with the demise of the whaling industry and sometimes six or twelve <b>months</b> <b>passed</b> without a vessel calling. With the provisions rotting in the storehouses the older families lost interest in market gardening.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942, the Joint Chiefs of Staff {{approved}} {{a series of}} operations against the Japanese bastion at Rabaul, which blocked any Allied advance along the northern coast of New Guinea towards the Philippines or northward towards the main Japanese naval base at Truk. In keeping with the overall Allied grand strategy of Europe first, the immediate aim of these operations was not the defeat of Japan but merely {{the reduction of the}} threat posed by Japanese aircraft and warships based at Rabaul to air and sea communications between the United States and Australia. By agreement among the Allied nations, in March 1942 the Pacific theatre was divided into the South West Pacific Area, under General Douglas MacArthur, and the Pacific Ocean Areas, under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. Rabaul fell within MacArthur's area but the initial operations in the southern Solomon Islands came under Nimitz. The Japanese reaction was more violent than anticipated and some <b>months</b> <b>passed</b> before the Guadalcanal Campaign was brought to a successful conclusion. Meanwhile, General MacArthur's forces—primarily Australian—fought off a series of Japanese offensives in Papua in the Kokoda Track Campaign, Battle of Milne Bay, Battle of Buna-Gona, and the Battle of Wau.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, back in Baghdad, Ibrahim faced desertions, rebellions and conspiracies, one {{of which}} {{involved}} his half-brother al-Mansur. Hasan ibn Sahl {{was able to use}} this turmoil and advance north, capturing Mada'in. As the <b>months</b> <b>passed,</b> discontent in Baghdad grew. Ibrahim's supporters, including Fadl ibn al-Rabi, began abandoning him, and in April and July 819 there was a plot to take Ibrahim captive and surrender him to al-Ma'mun's forces. Narrowly escaping from this conspiracy, Ibrahim abandoned the throne and went into hiding, opening the path for al-Ma'mun to reclaim Baghdad. On 17 August 819, al-Ma'mun entered Baghdad without resistance, and the political turmoil quickly subsided. Al-Ma'mun now set about to reconcile himself with the opposition: he rescinded the Alid succession, restored black as the dynastic colour, sent Hasan ibn Sahl into retirement, and recalled Tahir from his exile in Raqqa. Al-Ma'mun did however retain the title of imam, which became part of the standard caliphal titulature.|$|E
5|$|Linda Schuyler had co-created The Kids of Degrassi Street in 1979 with Kit Hood, and Yan Moore was {{a writer}} on that series. As the {{children}} grew up, the Degrassi franchise developed into Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High. In 1999 two episodes of Jonovision, a CBC Television talk show aimed at teenagers, reunited some of the cast members from the series. At the same time, Schuyler and Moore were developing a new television drama. When the Jonovision reunion episode proved to be popular, Schuyler and Moore wondered about reuniting the characters, too. As the <b>months</b> <b>passed,</b> they began thinking about {{what might have happened}} to the characters of Degrassi High and realized that the character Emma Nelson, born at the end of Degrassi Junior Highs second season, would soon be entering junior high school. Stephen Stohn, Schuyler's husband suggested Degrassi: The Next Generation as the name for the new sequel series, borrowing the concept from , of which he was a fan.|$|E
5|$|Northumberland, {{named after}} the {{ceremonial}} county, was ordered on 2 September 1861 from the Millwall Ironworks. She was laid down on 10 October 1861 at its shipyard in Millwall, London. She was altered while on the building slip after Sir Edward Reed succeeded Isaac Watts as Chief Constructor. Unlike her half-sisters, the ship spent five years on the stocks before {{she was ready to}} be launched, partially due to frequent changes in design, although Northumberland was much closer to completion. The additional weight caused her stick for an hour on the slipway before she slid halfway down with her stern only supported by air, threatening to buckle the ship. Efforts by hydraulic jacks and tugboats failed to get her into the water on the next spring tide failed, but the use of pontoons on 17 April 1866 proved successful. Her builders went into bankruptcy while the ship was being launched and the liquidators seized Northumberland as a company asset once she was in the water. Eight <b>months</b> <b>passed</b> before the Admiralty could take possession and begin fitting out the ship. She was commissioned in October 1868 and completed on 8 October for a cost a total of £444,256.|$|E

50|$|Other cost {{advantages}} of mixed mode commuting include lower vehicle insurance via Pay As You Drive programs; lower fuel and maintenance costs; and increased automobile life. In {{the most extreme}} cases, a mixed-mode commuter may opt to car share and pay {{only a small portion}} of purchase, fuel, maintenance, and insurance, or to live car-free. These cost benefits are offset by costs of transit, which can vary. A Maryland MTA <b>month</b> <b>pass</b> valid for MTA Light Rail, Metro Subway, and City Bus costs $64, while a <b>month</b> <b>pass</b> for the Baltimore to DC MARC costs $175.00 and a DC MetroRail 7 day pass costs $47 totaling $182.|$|R

25|$|During {{the course}} of the Civil War, most of the {{attempts}} to run the blockade succeeded, but as the <b>months</b> <b>passed,</b> the captains and crews on blockade patrol became more seasoned and grew wiser to the various tactics employed by blockade runners.

25|$|As <b>months</b> <b>passed,</b> Carías {{moved slowly}} but {{steadily}} to strengthen {{his hold on}} power.

Even in the height of the depression, he continued to make regular payments on the Honduran debt, adhering strictly to the terms of the arrangement with the British bondholders and also satisfying other creditors. Two small loans were paid off completely in 1935.|$|E
25|$|But unnamed top Justice Department {{officials}} delayed {{approving the}} prosecution {{for another three}} months. Finally, in May 1985, the Cleveland-based federal attorneys who had proposed prosecuting Presser were ordered to Washington, D.C.

Two <b>months</b> <b>passed,</b> and still no prosecution occurred. On July 17, the foreman of the Cleveland federal grand jury investigating Presser denounced the delay in open court.|$|E
25|$|By early August 1693, {{the four}} {{warships}} were sailing down the River Thames {{en route to}} Spain's northern city of Corunna. The journey to Corunna should have taken two weeks, {{but for some reason}} the ships did not arrive in Spain until five months later. Worse still, the necessary legal documents had apparently failed to arrive from Madrid, so the ships were forced to wait. As <b>months</b> <b>passed</b> and the documents still did not arrive, the sailors found themselves in an unenviable position: with no money to send home to support their families and unable to find alternate sources of employment, they had become virtual prisoners in Corunna.|$|E
