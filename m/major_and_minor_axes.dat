40|$|Large scale tidal field {{estimated}} {{directly from}} the distribution of dark matter halos is used to investigate how halo shapes and spin vectors are aligned with the cosmic web. The <b>major,</b> intermediate <b>and</b> <b>minor</b> <b>axes</b> of halos are aligned with the corresponding tidal axes, and halo spin axes tend to be parallel with the intermediate axes and perpendicular to the major axes of tidal field. The strengths of these alignments generally increase with halo mass and redshift, but the dependencies are only through the peak height, ν. The scaling relations of the alignment strengths with the value of ν indicate that the alignment strengths remain roughly constant when the structures within which the halos reside are still in quasi-linear regime, but decreases as nonlinear evolution becomes more important. We also calculate the alignments in projection so that our results can be compared directly with observations. Finally, we investigate the alignments of tidal tensors on large scales, and use the results to understand alignments of halo pairs separated at various distances. Our results suggest coherent structure of the tidal field is the underlying reason for the alignments of halos and galaxies seen in numerical simulations and in observations...|$|R

40|$|The mixed-field {{orientation}} of an asymmetric-rotor molecule with its permanent dipole moment non-parallel {{to the principal}} axes of polarizability is investigated experimentally and theoretically. We find that for the typical case of a strong, nonresonant laser field and a weak static electric field complete 3 D orientation is induced if the laser field is elliptically polarized <b>and</b> if its <b>major</b> <b>and</b> <b>minor</b> polarization <b>axes</b> are not parallel to the static field. For a linearly polarized laser field solely the dipole moment component along the most polarizable axis of the molecule is relevant resulting in 1 D orientation even when the laser polarization and the static field are non parallel.

This offers an alternative approach to 3 D orientation by combining a linearly-polarized laser field and a strong dc electric field arranged at an angle equal to the angle between the most polarizable axis of the molecule and its permanent dipole moment.

40|$|Recently, {{a debate}} has {{manifested}} in the spatial learning literature regarding the shape parameters by which mobile organisms orient {{with respect to the}} environment. On one hand are principal-axis-based strategies which suggest that organisms extract the <b>major</b> <b>and</b> <b>minor</b> principal <b>axes</b> of space which pass through the centroid and approximate length and width of the entire space, respectively. On the other hand are medial-axis-based strategies which suggest that organisms extract a trunk-and-branch system similar to the skeleton of a shape. With competing explanations comes the necessity to devise experiments capable of producing divergent predictions. Here, we suggest that a recent experiment (i. e., Sturz and Bodily, 2011 a) may be able to shed empirical light on this debate. Specifically, we suggest that a reevaluation of the design reveals that the enclosures used for training and testing appear to produce divergent predictions between these strategies. We suggest that the obtained data appear inconsistent with a medial-axis-based strategy and that the study may provide an example of the types of designs capable of discriminating between these geometric strategies of surface-based orientation. Such an approach appears critical to fundamental issues regarding the nature of space and spatial perception...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The dependences of the {{velocity}} ellipsoids of F–G {{stars of the}} thin disk of the Galaxy on their ages and metallicities are analyzed based on the {{new version of the}} Geneva. Copenhagen Catalog. The age dependences of the <b>major,</b> middle, <b>and</b> <b>minor</b> <b>axes</b> of the ellipsoids, and also of the dispersion of the total residual veltocity, obey power laws with indices 0. 25, 0. 29, 0. 32, and 0. 27 (with uncertainties ± 0. 02). Due to the presence of thick-disk objects, the analogous indices for all nearby stars are about a factor of 1. 5 larger. Attempts to explain such values are usually based on modeling relaxation processes in the Galactic disk. Elimination of stars in the most numerous moving groups from the sample slightly reduces the corresponding indices (0. 22, 0. 26, 0. 27, and 0. 24). Limiting the sample to stars within 60 pc of the Sun, so that the sample can be considered to be complete, leaves both {{the velocity}} ellipsoids and their age dependences virtually unchanged. With increasing age, the velocity ellipsoid increases in size and becomes appreciably more spherical, turns toward the direction of the Galactic center, and loses angular momentum.

40|$|Accurate {{information}} on the temperature eld and associ-ated heat transfer rates are particularly important in devising ap-propriate heat and water management strategies in proton ex-change membrane (PEM) fuel cells. An important parameter in fuel cell performance analysis is the effective thermal conductiv-ity of the gas diffusion layer (GDL). Estimation of the effective thermal conductivity is complicated because of the random na-ture of the GDL micro structure. In the present study, a compact analytical model for evaluating the effective thermal conductiv-ity of brous GDLs is developed. The model accounts for the salient geometric features, effects of bipolar pressure variation, gas rarefaction effects, and spreading resistance.

Central to this process is the ability to automate tomogram segmentation to identify sub-cellular components, facilitate molecular docking and annotate detected objects with associated metadata. Here we demonstrate that RAZA (Rapid 3 D z-crossings algorithm) provides a robust, accurate, intuitive, fast, and generally applicable segmentation algorithm capable of detecting organelles, membranes, macromolecular assemblies and extrinsic membrane protein domains. RAZA defines each continuous contour within a tomogram as a discrete object and extracts a set of 3 D structural fingerprints (<b>major,</b> middle <b>and</b> <b>minor</b> <b>axes,</b> surface area <b>and</b> volume), enabling selective, semi-automated segmentation and object extraction. RAZA takes advantage of the fact that the underlying algorithm is a true 3 D edge detector, allowing the axes of a detected object to be defined, independent of its random orientation within a cellular tomogram. The selectivity of object segmentation and extraction can be controlled by specifying a user-defined detection tolerance threshold for each fingerprint parameter, within which segmented objects must fall and/or by altering the number of search parameters, to define morphologically similar structures. We demonstrate the capability of RAZA to selectively extract subgroups of organelles (mitochondria) and macromolecular assemblies (ribosomes) from cellular tomograms.

At the same time, the inferred mass/luminosity ratio for the LSB disks appears to be systematically higher, when compared to the ratio for HSB ones...|$|R
