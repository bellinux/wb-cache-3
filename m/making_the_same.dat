5|$|Daniel Tack for Game Informer {{rated the}} game with an 8/10, {{comparing}} it to games such as Dwarf Fortress and Towns, but more accessible and with improved graphics. IGN 's Rowan Kaiser awarded an 8.3/10 score, noting that Banished suffered when the gameplay difficulty was lower, while also <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> comparison to Dwarf Fortress as Game Informer. Kaiser praised Banished for creating difficulty through {{the lack of a}} money resource, rather than using money as the primary source of difficulty.|$|E
5|$|The Texian army camped March 15–18 on the Lavaca River {{property}} of Williamson Daniels {{where they were}} joined by combined forces under Joe Bennett and Captain Peyton R. Splane. Fleeing civilians accompanied Houston's army turning north at the Navidad River as they crossed to {{the east side of the}} Colorado River at Burnam's Crossing. The ferry and trading post, as well as the family home of Jesse Burnam, were all burned at Houston's orders on March 17 to prevent Santa Anna's army from <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> crossing.|$|E

5|$|Yasuhara {{wanted the}} game to appeal to both Japanese and American players, which was why Green Hill Zone was {{redesigned}} many times. Sonic Team wanted the level to portray the character correctly. Its checkered ground was inspired by 3D image rendering from computers, an idea Naka obtained from Yu Suzuki, who used this technique with Space Harrier. The development team read each issue of Famitsu to stay informed of what their rivals were doing so they can avoid <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> mistakes.|$|E
5|$|The Red Army was {{scheduled}} to enter Lithuanian territory from three separate directions at 3:00 pm and had orders {{to take control of}} Vilnius, Kaunas, Raseiniai, Panevėžys, and Šiauliai. The Lithuanian Army was ordered not to resist and to extend friendly greetings; its air force was ordered to remain on the ground. The Soviets came in great numbers clogging Lithuanian roads. They had an obvious intention to show power and intimidate any resistance. Writer Ignas Šeinius claimed that he observed the same squadron of Soviet planes <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> flight over and over again to create an impression of much larger Soviet Air Forces.|$|E

5|$|By lap 20, Sebastian Vettel {{was closing}} the gap to the two Red Bulls ahead of him, coming within three second of Verstappen. On lap 22, Nico Hülkenberg retired when his power unit caught fire {{and he had to}} stop on the sidelines. While Massa had fought from 18th on the grid into tenth, his {{teammate}} Bottas was lying fifth by lap 25, ahead of Sainz. On lap 28, Ricciardo was again the first of the front runners to pit, taking on the soft compound. Vettel came in two laps later, <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> choice in tyres. This left Verstappen to lead Kimi Räikkönen, as it emerged that both would run on a different strategy, pitting only twice in contrast to the three stopping Vettel and Ricciardo. On lap 34, the gap between the two leaders was 2.1 seconds, before Verstappen came in on the following lap. Räikkönen responded one lap later, emerging behind Verstappen. On lap 39, Vettel came in for his third and final stop, while Ricciardo stayed out for another four laps. When he returned to the track, he was behind Vettel, but on fresher tyres.|$|E
5|$|Elliptic {{filters are}} filters {{produced}} by the insertion-loss method which use elliptic rational functions in their transfer function as an approximation to the ideal filter response {{and the result is}} called a Chebyshev approximation. This is the same Chebyshev approximation technique used by Cauer on image filters but follows the Darlington insertion-loss design method and uses slightly different elliptic functions. Cauer had some contact with Darlington and Bell Labs before WWII (for a time he worked in the US) but during the war they worked independently, in some cases <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> discoveries. Cauer had disclosed the Chebyshev approximation to Bell Labs but had not left them with the proof. Sergei Schelkunoff provided this and a generalisation to all equal ripple problems. Elliptic filters are a general class of filter which incorporate several other important classes as special cases: Cauer filter (equal ripple in passband and stopband), Chebyshev filter (ripple only in passband), reverse Chebyshev filter (ripple only in stopband) and Butterworth filter (no ripple in either band).|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s Coronation Street revolutionised UK {{television}} and {{quickly became a}} British institution. The BBC also produced several serials: Compact was about the staff of a women's magazine; The Newcomers was about the upheaval caused by a large firm setting up a plant in a small town; United! contained 147 episodes and focused on a football team; 199 Park Lane (1965) was an upper class serial, which ran for only 18 episodes. None of these serials came close to <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> impact as Coronation Street. Indeed, most of the 1960s BBC serials were largely wiped.|$|E

25|$|That test, Fairchild wrote, {{required}} that the court dispense with the mutuality provision under which {{a request for a}} lesser included charge can be granted only if the other side would also {{be able to make the}} same request.

Yet, the judge observed, there was no language in Rule 31(c) that would support such different treatment.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} issue of Huxley's Natural History Review, an article by George Rolleston on the {{orangutan}} brain showed the features that Owen claimed apes lacked, and when Owen responded {{in a letter to}} the Annals and Magazine of Natural History that the issue was a matter of definition rather than fact, Huxley made a public dissection of a spider monkey that had died at the zoo, to support his case. In the following issue John Marshall provided detailed measurements <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> point about the chimpanzee, as well as explaining how a chimpanzee's brain could be distorted by not being properly preserved and removed from the skull, so that it would look like the one in Owen's illustration.|$|E

Enraged and believing Patchi to be usurping him and also trying to take Juniper from him, Scowler goads Patchi into a battle for leadership of the herd. Scowler quickly wins and disowns Patchi, ordering Juniper {{and the rest of the}} herd to leave him behind.
