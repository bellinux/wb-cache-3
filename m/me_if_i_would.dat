25|$|Indie asked <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{keep the}} Barely Legal Radio program on Indie but stop doing mornings. I said yes. I loved doing the morning show for 2½ years but I am also {{looking forward to}} not getting up at 4 am any more. If you've ever had a morning job like this, you {{probably}} know the relief I feel, but I will still miss seeing Liz and Jose every day, having David Lynch as my weatherman, and talking to Timothy Olyphant about sports each morning. These will always rank with the coolest things I’ve ever been fortunate enough to do in my entire life.|$|E
2500|$|... "In my {{childhood}} {{an old man}} told <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> observe three things I would enjoy good health. I will say they proved useful to me, and may to others who read your paper. First, keep the head cool and calm. Second, keep the feet dry and warm. Third, keep the heart free from anger", she wrote.|$|E
2500|$|... "When the Board asked <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{accept the}} {{position}} of Conductor Laureate I was overwhelmed. This organization {{has been at the}} very center of my musical life for 17 years. I am very proud and honored that they would even consider me for such a prestigious title and it gives me great pleasure to accept. The Los Angeles Philharmonic will always play an important role in my life and this is a symbol of our continuing relationship." ...|$|E
6000|$|Search for a jewel {{that too}} casually [...] Hath left mine arm: it was thy master's. Shrew <b>me</b> [...] <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> lose {{it for a}} revenue [...] Of any king's in Europe!--Cymbeline.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} blame her," [...] she loyally insisted. [...] "I am to blame. My guides tell <b>me</b> that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{surrender}} myself completely to them <b>I</b> <b>would</b> find peace," [...] she ended, slowly, sadly, {{as if in}} confession.|$|R
6000|$|... "You said affection was {{the best}} thing, and I have hardly any--none about <b>me.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> could, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have mamma; but that is impossible. Things have changed to me so--in such a short time. What I used not to like I long for now. I think I am almost getting fond of the old things now they are gone." [...] Her lip trembled.|$|R
2500|$|As well as kazoos, {{the song}} {{features}} a saxophone and organ, and an orchestra arranged by Gorgoni. [...] She also recorded {{a version of}} [...] "Dumb Head" [...] in Japanese. [...] Arnell said:The record was a hit over in Asia and they asked <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be nice enough to record the song in Japanese for them. [...] I thought [...] "What?!" [...] But MGM was very good about sending a tutor [...] {{taught me how to}} sing it phonetically. [...] It was very exciting and it came out OK. [...] I don't know if it's word-for-word as the American version, but it sure is nice to listen to...|$|E
2500|$|Charles Grean of Dot Records had {{arranged}} with {{the studio to}} do an album of space music based on music from Star Trek, {{and he has a}} teenage daughter who's a fan of the show and a fan of Mr. Spock. She said, 'Well, if you're going to do an album of music from Star Trek, then Mr. Spock should be on the album.' So Dot contacted me and asked <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be interested in either speaking or singing on the record. I said I was very interested in doing both. ...That was the first album we did, which was called Mr. Spock's Music from Outer Space. It was very well received and successful enough that Dot then approached me and asked me to sign a long-term contract.|$|E
2500|$|Apart {{from the}} {{betrayal}} of the POUMists, the terror and the murder of Nin and Smillie, Orwell had been depressed by {{the attitude of the}} British press. [...] "In Spain ... I saw newspaper reports which did not bear any relation to the facts ... I saw, in fact, history being written not in terms of what happened but of what ought to have happened according to various party lines." [...] Carr writes, [...] "He was appalled at the treatment of the May days as a 'Trotskyist Revolt' in papers like the News Chronicle which simply swallowed uncritically the Communist line; or Ralph Bates' report in The New Republic that POUM militiamen were playing football with Fascist troops ... Given this supresio vero by interested parties, how could true history be written? Propaganda would pass as truth; 'facts' could be manipulated. Those who monopolized communication could create their own history after the event—the nightmare of Nineteen Eighty-Four." [...] Orwell attacked sections of the left wing press for suppressing the truth about Spain, indicting the Communists for instigating a [...] "reign of terror"; and he never forgave Kingsley Martin, the editor of the New Statesman who turned down his articles on the Spanish Civil War {{on the grounds that they}} [...] "could cause trouble." [...] Malcolm Muggeridge remembered: [...] "Once when we were lunching at a Greek restaurant in Percy Street he asked <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> mind changing places. I readily agreed but asked him why. He said that he just couldn't bear to look at Kingsley Martin's corrupt face, which, as Kingsley was lunching at an adjoining table, was unavoidable from where he had been sitting before." [...] "Ten years ago it was almost impossible to get anything printed in favour of Communism; today it is almost impossible to get anything printed in favour of Anarchism or 'Trotskyism'," [...] Orwell wrote bitterly in 1938.|$|E
60|$|When I {{came of age}} {{my father}} asked <b>me,</b> one day, <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> step with him into his study.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{said that}} he was a trader in sandal-wood, and no pirate, and told <b>me</b> that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> join him for this trip he would give me a good share of the profits, or put me on shore in some civilised island <b>if</b> <b>I</b> chose." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{not until}} our work was nearly done that I came upon my father and he {{received}} <b>me</b> as <b>if</b> expecting <b>I</b> <b>would</b> come.|$|R
2500|$|Tendulkar's {{allegations}} {{were supported by}} former teammates such as Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh and V. V. S. Laxman. Zaheer called Chappell a [...] "control freak" [...] and said, [...] "After he was appointed {{the coach of the}} Indian team, he once came upto me and told [...] "Zaheer, you will not be playing for India till I remain the coach". He also added that the two-year term under Chappell was [...] "easily the worst and darkest phase" [...] that he could remember. Harbhajan said, [...] "Chappell destroyed Indian cricket {{to such an extent that}} it required at least 3 years to again get back on track. The worst part was some players in that team, who sucked upto the coach and would supply selective misinformation creating bigger rifts". He also talked about the email leak, [...] "Sourav was batting out there in the middle and this man was typing a critical e-mail against Sourav, sitting right there in that dressing room. He had no interest in the proceedings of the match. There were seven guys that he wanted to get rid of. Sourav was his primary target followed by myself, Virender Sehwag, Ashish Nehra, Zaheer Khan and Yuvraj Singh". Laxman was also critical of Chappell in saying that Chappell took Indian cricket [...] "backwards" [...] during his coaching tenure. Laxman also recalled an incident from 2006, [...] "This happened in 2006 at the Wankhede Stadium when India played versus England. Yuvraj Singh was picked ahead of me. We were going to the West Indies for a four-Test series after that and he asked <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> open. I mentioned in 2000 I had decided I would not open anymore after it didn't work for me in the first four years. I was consistent in the middle order since 2000. Chappell asked me my age and said - Don't you think 31 is too young an age to sit at home? I was astonished to hear this. I had a very good run under him. I was the second highest run scorer under him." ...|$|E
60|$|Major Selby muttered {{something}} uncomplimentary about Sir John, {{and then asked}} <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> come home with him.|$|E
60|$|My friend B. {{called on}} {{me this morning}} and asked <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> go to a theatre with him on Monday next.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here, Mai-Mai!" [...] he cried, [...] "another bottle!" [...] And, when it came, {{with one}} stroke of a knife, he summarily {{beheaded}} it, and commanded me to drain {{it to the}} bottom. He then told <b>me</b> that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> come on board his vessel the following morning, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> find the ship's articles on the cabin transom.|$|R
6000|$|When {{both had}} {{received}} their punishment, the lieutenant said: “Now {{you can put}} on your clothes again and carry the news {{of what you have}} had to your village, and tell your friends that I wish I had had every man concerned in the matter before <b>me.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> had <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have dealt out the same punishment to all. Now, lads, I shall be leaving in an hour’s time; if you like to send back to the village for your clothes, one of the men will take the message.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You or any and I or any--what sort {{of speech}} is that? Is it a compliment, think you, to be {{mixed with a}} drove in that fashion? My {{question}} was of you and <b>me.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> were wronged <b>would</b> you be my man?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Number two, Pa, {{is much to}} {{the same}} purpose, though not so preposterous. Mr Lightwood would propose to <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> let him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt. He {{has been}} good enough to amuse me with mysterious threats as to {{what he would do}} to punish <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To pray <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> save {{myself from}} {{death and the}} vengeance of God, to work upon {{the heart of his}} Highness, which I know not how to do----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It {{was all a}} plot {{gotten up}} by those two, Jasniff and Merwell,” said Hooker Montgomery. “They promised <b>me</b> some money <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> help them, but I never got a cent.” Then he said that Jasniff and Merwell were in town.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, yes, I can't deny that. But {{he could}} have ruined me, wrecked me, yet he did not. At least, he meant {{marriage}} by <b>me.</b> He said <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> marry him he would flee over the border and be an honest man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] Mrs. Kenton soothingly assented. [...] "And I don't {{say that}} she dreams of him in any such way. She can't help admiring his mind. But what I mean {{is that when you}} see how he appreciates her, you can't help wishing he could know just how wise, and just how good she is. It did seem to <b>me</b> as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> give almost {{anything}} to have him know what she had been through with that--rapscallion!" ...|$|R
60|$|Next morning Haught asked <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to {{ride around}} {{through the woods}} and {{probably}} get {{a shot at a}} deer. Romer coaxed so to go that I finally consented.|$|E
60|$|He {{then asked}} <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> please to grant him one thing, that, {{whatever}} his opinion should be, {{what he should}} say should be no prejudice to them in their present condition.|$|E
6000|$|... "Every one has his taste, to be sure," [...] said Halliday; [...] "but d--n <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have vexed {{so sweet}} a girl as that is, {{for all the}} whigs that ever swore the Covenant." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{not long}} after our former discourse, when he {{repeated}} what he had insinuated before, namely, that he had yet a design to lay before <b>me,</b> which, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> agree to his proposals, would more than balance all accounts between us. I told him I could not reasonably deny him anything; and except one thing, which I hoped and believed he would not think of, I should think myself very ungrateful <b>if</b> <b>I</b> did not do everything for him that lay in my power.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was several}} minutes before Fred could do this. [...] "I came {{up by the}} way of the Chilkoot Pass," [...] he said, when he felt able to speak. [...] "I joined a party I met in Juneau, a crowd of men from Chicago, and they promised to see <b>me</b> through <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> do my share of work. But the work was too hard for me, and they treated me like a dog, and at Baker's Creek they kicked me out of camp and {{compelled}} me to shift for myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Father Lucien, [...] "some {{time after}} we pitched camp, {{a man came}} in with a dog-team that belonged to the Hudson's Bay. He was not going farther but offered to lend <b>me</b> the dogs, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> leave them with some friends of his who were {{trapping}} to the south." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not a word,' said Dan. 'Don't you be afeard about that. I {{feel that}} I baint upon my own ground to-day; and wouldn't do {{anything}} to cause an upset, drown <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would.</b> Would you, Sol?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not under}} trust," [...] said Antony. [...] "Your father {{may be a}} sworn servant of the Earl and, the Queen--Queen Elizabeth, I mean; but I have taken no oaths--nobody asked <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> come here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... --I wouldn't, said Heron, damn <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would.</b> That's {{no way to}} {{send for}} one of the senior boys. In a bake, indeed! I think it's quite enough that you're taking a part in his bally old play.|$|E
6000|$|... "Farewell, my child. I shall {{send you}} no more notes. Write or {{come to me}} the moment the deed is done! Come to <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> you can; <b>I</b> <b>would</b> hear your own lips tell me the news. Yet do as seems best to you. In sympathy and love, ...|$|R
60|$|For {{she was so}} hard to understand, or, at least, she was so for a dull-witted country lad like <b>me.</b> For <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> talk to her of my real prospects, and how {{by taking}} {{in the whole of}} Corriemuir we might earn a hundred good pounds over the extra rent, and maybe be able to build out the parlour at West Inch, so as to make it fine for her when we married, she would pout her lips and droop her eyes, as though she scarce had {{patience}} to listen to <b>me.</b> But <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> let her build up dreams about what I might become, how I might find a paper which proved me to be the true heir of the laird, or how, without joining the army, which she would by no means hear of, I showed myself to be a great warrior until my name was in all folks' mouths, then she would be as blithe as the May. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> keep up the play as well as I could, but soon some luckless word <b>would</b> show that <b>I</b> was only plain Jock Calder of West Inch, and out would come her lip again in scorn of me. So we moved on, she in the air and I on the ground; and if the rift had not come in one way, it must in another.|$|R
60|$|So {{he withdrew}} from me, {{and then came}} several of the justice's {{servants}} to me, {{and told me that}} I stood so much upon a nicety. Their master, they said, was willing to let <b>me</b> go; and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> but say <b>I</b> <b>would</b> call the people no more together, I might have my liberty, &c.|$|R
