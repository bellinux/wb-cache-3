5|$|In 1952, the Technicolor Corporation {{contracted}} with SRI {{to develop a}} near-instantaneous, electro-optical alternative to the <b>manual</b> <b>process</b> of timing during film copying. In 1959, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented the Scientific and Engineering Award jointly to SRI and Technicolor for their work on the design {{and development of the}} Technicolor electronic printing timer which greatly benefited the motion picture industry. In 1954, Southern Pacific asked SRI to investigate ways of reducing damage during rail freight shipments by mitigating shock to railroad box cars. This investigation led to William K. MacCurdy's development of the Hydra-Cushion technology, which remains standard today.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to analyze the risk {{exposures}} and costs involved in cleaning parts, equipment, and tooling in the semiconductor industry using wet <b>manual</b> <b>processes</b> and compare carbon dioxide as an alternative cleaning process. The research focuses on wet <b>manual</b> <b>processes</b> currently used by semiconductor manufacturers to clean parts, tools, and equipment and carbon dioxide cleaning processes as an alternative to these processes. A current analysis of the chemicals used in the wet <b>manual</b> <b>processes</b> and the risks they pose to an organization compared to the risks associated with carbon dioxide processes. The research concludes that carbon dioxide blast cleaning processes reduce or eliminate employee health exposures, wastewater discharge, hazardous waste treatment costs, reduced environmental reporting requirements and liability issues, and clean at or better than current wet <b>manual</b> <b>processes.</b> TABLE OF CONTENTS Abstract………………………………………………………………………...|$|R

25|$|Until {{the mid-1980s}} there was little, if any, new {{investment}} in the sport, with the decline in interest being partially attributed to the complex scoring system, especially {{as it was a}} <b>manual</b> <b>process</b> then. However, this all changed with the introduction of automated electronic scoring systems. The general public only had to enter their names into the computers and everything else was done automatically.|$|E
25|$|One common {{limitation}} to the Function Point methodology {{is that it}} is a <b>manual</b> <b>process</b> {{and therefore}} it can be labor-intensive and costly in large scale initiatives such as application development or outsourcing engagements. This negative aspect of applying the methodology may be what motivated industry IT leaders to form the Consortium for IT Software Quality focused on introducing a computable metrics standard for automating the measuring of software size while the IFPUG keep promoting a manual approach as most of its activity rely on FP counters certifications.|$|E
25|$|In the past, these medical reports {{consisted}} of very abbreviated handwritten notes that were {{added in the}} patient's file for interpretation by the primary physician responsible for the treatment. Ultimately, this mess of handwritten notes and typed reports were consolidated into a single patient file and physically stored along with thousands of other patient records in a wall of filing cabinets in the medical records department. Whenever the need arose to review the records of a specific patient, the patient's file would be retrieved from the filing cabinet and delivered to the requesting physician. To enhance this <b>manual</b> <b>process,</b> many medical record documents were produced in duplicate or triplicate by means of carbon copy.|$|E

25|$|A robotic CNC router is a {{computer}} controlled robotic arm in which the router or spindle {{is part of a}} head mounted {{to the end of the}} robot arm. The main difference between a CNC router and a robotic router is the ability to router using a 4,5 or 6-axis coordinate system because of the rotation allowed by the joints in the robot arm as well as the rotation of the head that the router spindle is mounted to. CAD/CAM software programming can be used to indicate the part location, which is usually fixed to an immobile table and clamped in place. The robotic router trimming process then follows a programmed path for router cutting to create a part from a blank or more commonly- to trim the flashing from a molded part to complete the finishing process that in the past, was a <b>manual</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
25|$|Contracts for {{the project}} were awarded {{to some of the}} biggest and most reputed {{construction}} firms in India, including Larsen & Toubro, Gammon India and AFCONS. To enable quicker construction, several innovative practices were adopted. Piers for major bridges were cast on the riverbanks itself and launched using cranes mounted on pontoons. The technique of incremental launching of bridge spans was used {{for the first time in}} India. Since it would take too long to complete the project using locally available tunnelling technology, nine hydraulic tunnelling machines were imported from Sweden in order to bore through the hard rock of the Sahayadris. The biggest challenge, however, came from the nine tunnels that had to be bored through soft soil. No technology existed anywhere in the world for this purpose and the work had to be carried out through a painstakingly slow <b>manual</b> <b>process.</b> Excavation was almost impossible due to the clayey soil that was saturated with water owing to a high water table in the region. Several times tunnels collapsed immediately after they had been dug, necessitating work to be redone. Nineteen lives and four years were lost while constructing the soft soil tunnels alone. In all, seventy-four people perished during the construction of the line.|$|E
500|$|After a tank is cleaned, {{provided}} {{that it is}} going to be prepared for entry, it will be purged. Purging is accomplished by pumping inert gas into the tank until hydrocarbons have been sufficiently expelled. Next the tank is gas freed which is usually accomplished by blowing fresh air into the space with portable air powered or water powered air blowers. [...] "Gas freeing" [...] brings the oxygen content of the tank up to 20.8% O2. The inert gas buffer between fuel and oxygen atmospheres ensures they are never capable of ignition. Specially trained personnel monitor the tank's atmosphere, often using hand-held gas indicators which measure the percentage of hydrocarbons present. After a tank is gas-free, it may be further hand-cleaned in a <b>manual</b> <b>process</b> known as mucking. Mucking requires protocols for entry into confined spaces, protective clothing, designated safety observers, and possibly the use of airline respirators.|$|E

2500|$|During World War I, {{computing}} {{a target}} intercept course for a torpedo was a <b>manual</b> <b>process</b> where the fire control party was aided by various slide rules (the U.S. examples were colloquially called [...] "banjo", for its shape, and [...] "Is/Was", for predicting where a target {{will be based}} on where it is and was) or mechanical calculator/sights. These were often [...] "woefully inaccurate", which helps explain why torpedo spreads were advised.|$|E
2500|$|The {{preferred}} {{process of}} {{flash butt welding}} involves an automated track-laying machine running a strong electrical current through the touching ends of two unjoined pieces of rail. The ends become white hot due to electrical resistance and are then pressed together forming a strong weld. Thermite welding is used to repair or splice together existing CWR segments. [...] This is a <b>manual</b> <b>process</b> requiring a reaction crucible and form to contain the molten iron. Thermite-bonded joints are seen as less reliable and more prone to fracture or break.|$|E
