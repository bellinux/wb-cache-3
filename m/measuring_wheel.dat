25|$|The Double Cone Trek was {{conceived}} in 1966 by Camp Director Chet Frisbie and Program Director Red Bryan. They sent three summer camp staff and Eagle Scouts—Bill Roberts, Terry Trotter, and Martin Woodward—to {{check out a}} multi-day hike around the camp. Roberts secured a <b>measuring</b> <b>wheel</b> from the Sierra Club. Trotter conducted nature surveys, noting the various flora and fauna at campsites, and took photographs. Woodward was tasked with noting all the campsite amenities or lack thereof, and all three brainstormed about the merit badges that might be worked on during the trek. The hike circles the Boy Scout camp, beginning at Bottcher's Gap, eastward around the Ventana Double Cone though Hiding Canyon and over the Pine Ridge Trail, west over the Big Sur River to Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park, and then back east through Pico Blanco Public Camp to the Boy Scout camp. Portions of the last stretch of trail were so overgrown {{at the time that}} Roberts had to carry the <b>measuring</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
50|$|When the planimeter's <b>measuring</b> <b>wheel</b> moves {{perpendicular}} to its axis, it rolls, and this movement is recorded. When the <b>measuring</b> <b>wheel</b> moves parallel to its axis, the wheel skids without rolling, so this movement is ignored. That means the planimeter measures {{the distance that}} its <b>measuring</b> <b>wheel</b> travels, projected perpendicularly to the measuring wheel's axis of rotation. The area of the shape {{is proportional to the}} number of turns through which the <b>measuring</b> <b>wheel</b> rotates.|$|E

50|$|The {{left hand}} {{side of the}} above equation, which {{is equal to the}} area A {{enclosed}} by the contour, is proportional to the distance measured by the <b>measuring</b> <b>wheel,</b> with proportionality factor m, the length of the measuring arm.|$|E
50|$|The Amsler (polar) type {{consists}} of a two-bar linkage. At {{the end of one}} link is a pointer, used to trace around the boundary of the shape to be measured. The other end of the linkage pivots freely on a weight that keeps it from moving. Near the junction of the two links is a <b>measuring</b> <b>wheel</b> of calibrated diameter, with a scale to show fine rotation, and worm gearing for an auxiliary turns counter scale. As the area outline is traced, this wheel rolls {{on the surface of the}} drawing. The operator sets the wheel, turns counter to zero, and then traces the pointer around the perimeter of the shape. When the tracing is complete, the scales at the <b>measuring</b> <b>wheel</b> show the shape's area.|$|E
50|$|Once a new {{computer}} is installed, it usually requires proper configuration. This normally includes selecting distance units (kilometers vs. miles) and the circumference of the wheel. Since the sensor <b>measures</b> <b>wheel</b> rotation, different wheel sizes will translate to different measures of speed and distance for a given number of rotations.|$|R
50|$|Each {{revolution}} of the <b>wheel</b> <b>measures</b> a specific distance, such as a yard, metre or half-rod. Thus counting revolutions with a mechanical device attached to the <b>wheel</b> <b>measures</b> the distance directly.|$|R
50|$|In North America {{the chain}} is still used in agriculture: <b>measuring</b> <b>wheels</b> with a {{circumference}} of 0.1 chain (diameter ≈ 2.1 ft or 64 cm) are still common and {{readily available in}} the United States and Canada. For a rectangular tract, multiplying the number of turns {{of one of these}} wheels for each of two adjacent sides and dividing by 1000 gives the area in acres.|$|R
50|$|The {{working of}} the linear {{planimeter}} {{may be explained}} by measuring the area of a rectangle ABCD (see image). Moving with the pointer from A to B the arm EM moves through the yellow parallelogram, with area equal to PQ&times;EM. This area is also equal to the area of the parallelogram A"ABB". The <b>measuring</b> <b>wheel</b> measures the distance PQ (perpendicular to EM). Moving from C to D the arm EM moves through the green parallelogram, with area equal to the area of the rectangle D"DCC". The <b>measuring</b> <b>wheel</b> now moves in the opposite direction, subtracting this reading from the former. The movements along BC and DA are the same but opposite, so they cancel each other with no net effect on the reading of the wheel. The net result is the measuring of the difference of the yellow and green areas, which is the area of ABCD.|$|E

50|$|All of {{this can}} be {{controlled}} by one operator sitting in the cab of the vehicle. A control computer can simplify mechanical movements and can keep records of the length and diameter of trees cut. Length is computed by either counting the rotations of the gripping wheels or, more commonly, using the <b>measuring</b> <b>wheel.</b> Diameter is computed from the pivot angle of the gripping wheels or delimbing knives when hugging the tree. Length measurement also can be used for automated cutting of the tree into predefined lengths. Computer software can predict the volume of each stem based on analysing stems harvested previously. This information when used in conjunction with price lists for each specific log specification enables the optimisation of log recovery from the stem.|$|E

Stochastic modeling of the wheel topography can allow for statistical bounding of the grind force characteristics allowing improved surface quality without sacrificing productivity. This study utilizes a machine vision method to <b>measure</b> the <b>wheel</b> topography of diamond micro{{grinding wheels}}. The results showed that there are large variances in wheel specifications from the manufacturer. The numerical simulation and analytic models {{used to describe the}} wheel topography were seen to estimate the static grit density to within 4. 5 % using <b>measured</b> <b>wheel</b> geometry specifications. Utilizing only manufacturer-supplied specifications caused the models to predict the static grit density to within 24 % leading to a need for improved wheel tolerancing and in situ wheel measurement...|$|R
5000|$|The images {{show the}} {{principles}} of a linear and a polar planimeter. The pointer M {{at one end of}} the planimeter follows the contour C of the surface S to be measured. For the linear planimeter the movement of the [...] "elbow" [...] E is restricted to the y-axis. For the polar planimeter the [...] "elbow" [...] is connected to an arm with its other endpoint O at a fixed position. Connected to the arm ME is the <b>measuring</b> <b>wheel</b> with its axis of rotation parallel to ME. A movement of the arm ME can be decomposed into a movement perpendicular to ME, causing the wheel to rotate, and a movement parallel to ME, causing the wheel to skid, with no contribution to its reading.|$|E
50|$|A cam/rocker {{assembly}} uses {{a normal}} cam, but the roller-tip-rocker has a wheel {{on the end}} of it like that of a <b>measuring</b> <b>wheel,</b> which rolls by the use of needle bearings. Others will add roller bearings for the main pivot also. Although roller rockers are used in both pushrod and overhead cam engines, roller rockers for pushrod and overhead cam engines are considerably different in design. For pushrod engines, roller rockers employ a roller where the rocker contacts the valve stem. On the other hand, roller rockers for overhead cam engines employ a roller where the rocker contacts the cam. This greatly reduces frictional losses and wear compared to slipper followers (where the cam simply slides on a surface on the rocker arm). The difference between a roller rocker and a standard rocker with slipper followers on an overhead cam engine is analogous to the difference between roller lifters and flat tappet lifters on a pushrod engine.|$|E
50|$|Wheel sensors {{along the}} tracks feel for flat {{spots on the}} train's wheels. Any flat wheel that becomes too {{dangerous}} to travel on (a big flat spot on the train wheel) will be counted as a defect. Typically, these systems utilise accelerometers, strain gauges, fibre optic methods, or the very latest (WIPD) wheel impact phase detector. A wheel impact load detector (WILD) measures impacts, but does not normalise these impact measurements against anything: simply the impact reading. They do not attempt to cater for differences in sprung mass, as they are <b>measuring</b> <b>wheel</b> defect impact rather than impact load. Therefore, the same wheel defect will register a much larger impact when a wagon is loaded, versus when it is empty.A wheel condition monitoring detector monitors {{the condition of the}} wheel independent of sprung mass - independent of load. They do this by subtracting the wheel mass to get the normalised impact value. These systems are therefore typically better at detecting smaller defects with greater resolution.|$|E

50|$|At the time, no {{facilities}} {{existed in}} Germany that could test the actual failure {{limit of the}} wheels, and so complete prototypes were never tested physically. The design and specification relied greatly on available materials data and theory. The very few laboratory and rail tests that were performed did not <b>measure</b> <b>wheel</b> behaviour with extended wear conditions or speeds greater than normal cruising. Nevertheless, {{over a period of}} years the wheels proved themselves apparently reliable and, until the accident, had not caused any major problems.|$|R
40|$|Accurate tire {{modeling}} is of key {{importance to}} the development of modern vehicles. Traditional Flat-Trac testing of tires is expensive and time consuming. In order to increase the efficiency of the vehicle development process, a new method for identifying Magic Formula tire model parameters has been investigated. By driving specific maneuvers with a vehicle instrumented with sensors to <b>measure</b> <b>wheel</b> forces and angles, tire model parameters can be estimated by use of a global optimization algorithm. Full vehicle simulations were made in order to identify the test procedures necessary to provide a representative range of data for a tire. A tire model parameter fitting tool was developed and validated with Flat-Trac datasets. Physical testing was carried out to reproduce the simulated driving maneuvers on a car equipped with wheel force transducers, an inertial measurement device, and a high-speed camera system to <b>measure</b> <b>wheel</b> angles and displacements. Results of estimating the pure slip lateral tire model parameters from the in-vehicle measurements shows good correlation to the original tire model. Furthermore, the tire model parameters identified by this method more accurately represent the behavior of the tire on the test vehicle, without the need to modify scaling parameters. This indicates that this newly proposed method can produce accurate tire model parameters that require less tuning of scaling parameters to accurately represent vehicle behavior...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} reproducibility, {{responsiveness}} and concurrent {{validity of the}} six-minute walk test (6 MWT) when tested outdoors in patients' own neighbourhoods using a global positioning system (GPS) or a <b>measuring</b> <b>wheel.</b> Methods: A total of 27 chronic stroke patients, discharged to their own homes, were tested twice, within 5 consecutive days. The 6 MWT was conducted using a GPS and an <b>measuring</b> <b>wheel</b> simultaneously to determine walking distance. Reproducibility was determined as test-retest reliability and agreement, using the intraclass correlation coefficient, standard error of measurement and Bland & Altman plots. Responsiveness was expressed as the smallest real difference and visualized in Bland & Altman plots. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) was used to study concurrent validity between the GPS and <b>measuring</b> <b>wheel.</b> Results: Intraclass correlation coefficiens were 0. 96 for the GPS and 0. 98 for the <b>measuring</b> <b>wheel,</b> and standard error of measurement scores were 11. 9 m for the <b>measuring</b> <b>wheel</b> and 18. 1 m for the GPS, resulting in smallest real differences of 33. 0 m and 50. 2 m, respectively. Concurrent validity was strong (r = 0. 99). Conclusion: These {{results indicate that the}} outdoor 6 MWT using a GPS or <b>measuring</b> <b>wheel</b> is reproducible, responsive and concurrently valid. This suggests that therapists working in the community can use the outdoor 6 MWT as a reliable, responsive and valid test. © 2011 Foundation of Rehabilitation Information...|$|E

40|$|For many years, on-farm yield {{evaluations}} of corn (Zea mays L.) hybrids {{were done with}} weigh wagons, handheld moisture testers, and <b>measuring</b> <b>wheels.</b> Today, most combines have continuous flow yield and moisture sensors. Published research results comparing the accuracy of combine-mounted sensor systems with that of weigh wagons are limited for on-farm corn hybrid evaluation. This study examined the accuracy of combine-mounted yield sensors with traditional weigh wagon methodology in on-farm corn hybrid strip trials. Data from combine-mounted sensors for plot weight, moisture percentage, and yield were compared with weigh wagon weight, handheld moisture testers, and calculated yield in six nonreplicated strip trials in 2012, 2013, and 2014 in east-central South Dakota. A total of 195 total entries were compared. Pearson correlation coefficients and linear regressions for weight, moisture percentage, and yield were calculated for each environment and for all environments combined. The Pearson correlation coefficients across all environments were 0. 998 for weight of grain in pounds, 0. 928 for grain moisture content percentage, and 0. 983 for yield in bushels per acre corrected for moisture content. The probability of nonsignificance for weight, moisture percentage, and yield was P 3 ̆c 0. 0001. Linear regression models predicting combine-mounted sensor of sample weight, sample moisture, and yield with the traditional system were significant at P 3 ̆c 0. 0001 for all three measurements.
