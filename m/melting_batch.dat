40|$|The {{effects of}} source {{composition}} and source evolution during progressive partial melting on {{the chemistry of}} mantle-derived mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) melts were tested using a comprehensive geochemical and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic dataset for fresh, magnesian basaltic glasses from the Miocene Macquarie Island ophiolite, SW Pacific. These glasses: (1) exhibit clear parent-daughter relationships; (2) allow simple reconstruction of primary melt compositions; (3) show exceptional compositional diversity (e. g. K 2 O/TiO 2 0. 09 - 0. 9; La/Yb 1. 5 - 22; Pb- 206 /Pb- 204 18. 70 - 19. 52); (4) preserve changes in major element and isotope compositions, which are correlated with the degree of trace element enrichment (e. g. La/Sm). Conventional models for MORB genesis invoke melting of mantle that is heterogeneous on a small scale, followed by binary mixing of variably lithophile element-enriched <b>melt</b> <b>batches.</b> This type of model fails to explain the compositions of the Macquarie Island glasses, principally because incompatible element ratios (e. g. Nb/U, Sr/Nd) and Pb isotope ratios vary non-systematically with the degree of enrichment. We propose that individual <b>melt</b> <b>batches</b> are produced from instantaneous 'parental' mantle parageneses, which change continuously as melting and melt extraction proceeds. This concept of a 'dynamic source' combines the models of small-scale mantle heterogeneities and fractional melting. A dynamic source is an assemblage of locally equilibrated mantle solids and a related melt fraction. Common MORB magmas that integrate the characteristics of numerous <b>melt</b> <b>batches</b> therefore tend to conceal the chemical and isotopic identity of a dynamic source. This study shows that isotope ratios of poorly mixed MORB melts are a complex function of the dynamic source evolution, and that the range in isotope ratios within a single MORB suite does not necessarily require mixing of diverse components...|$|R

Instead of mixing powdered materials together into a <b>batch,</b> <b>melting</b> that <b>batch</b> and pouring out sheets of glass, ULE, being such a high temperature glass, has to be made in a flame hydrolysis process. In this process high purity precursors are injected into the flames, which causes them to react and form TiO2 and SiO2. The TiO2 and SiO2 then fall down and are deposited onto the growing glass.|$|R
40|$|Glass batch melting {{has been}} studied by many {{researchers}} on various scales and under various conditions but no comprehensive understanding has been reached. In view of this situation, {{a major part of}} this work was devoted to the improvement of five new experimental methods suitable for the investigation of batch melting. These are: conductometry, thermal diffusivity, heating microsopy, batch free time (BFT) and weight loss measurement. Firstly, as for the development of conductometry, three meaningful ways to present batch reactions in terms of "DTA", "voltage drop", and "electrical conductivity" were concluded. It was also possible to determine the duration of stages characterized by foaming. Secondly, for thermal diffusivity, an optimized output signals at a frequency of 50 Hz with time interval of 150 s was applied. It showed good measurment results. As a conclusion, the grain-to-grain contact in model calculations should be taken into account by a dimensionless shape factor of 2. 5 to 3. 5. Local conductometry combined with temperature measurement allowed to measure simultaueously the electrical conductivity and the local temperature in a <b>melting</b> <b>batch.</b> The measurement of the local thermal diffusivity was performed by an evaluation of the runtime of a periodically generated heat pulse. Thirdly, for the heating microscope, a new way to present the effect of gas release from glass batches prior to refining was developed. It was found that minor batch additions additions have a large influence. Fourthly, the BFT results show that the reaction behavior of container flint and green glass batches was more sluggish than that of crystal glass batches. By observation through a silica tube furnace, the beginning of batch reactions with cullets at the surface deep into the glass melt were observed. After 2 minutes foam was formed and decreaed within 10 minutes. Finally, weight loss determination for samples up 200 g was developed. It was found that the mass loss of soda ash detected in a vertical tube furnace started at a lower temperature and was completed at a higher temperature than suggested by the results measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). These new characterization methods not only open concepts for the presentation and interpretation of batch reactions, but also close the experimental gap between conventional lab scale characterization and the behavior actually observed in industrial production...|$|E

Simulant materials were synthesized by <b>melting</b> <b>batched</b> reagents in a tube furnace at 1500 °C, under reducing atmosphere with controlled cooling to room temperature, to simulate conditions of lava formation. Characterization using XRD and SEM-EDX identified several crystalline phases including ZrO 2, UOx and solid solutions with spherical metal particles encapsulated by a glassy matrix. The UOX and ZrO 2 phase morphology was very diverse comprising of fused crystals to dendritic crystallites from the crystallization of uranium initially dissolved in the glass phase.

40|$|Several {{authors have}} {{proposed}} that granitic melt accumulation and transport from the source region occurs in networks of connected melt-filled veins and dykes. These models envisage the smallest leucosomes as 'rivulets' that connect to feed larger dykes that form the 'rivers' through which magma ascends through the sub-solidus crust. This paper critically reviews this 'rivulets-feeding-rivers' model. It is argued that such melt-filled networks are unlikely to develop in nature, because melt flows and accumulates well before a fully connected network can be established. In the alternative stepwise accumulation model, flow and accumulation is transient in both space and time. Observations on migmatites at Port Navalo, France, {{that were used to}} support the existence of melt-filled networks are discussed and reinterpreted. In this interpretation, the structures in these migmatites are consistent with the collapse and draining of individual <b>melt</b> <b>batches,</b> supporting the stepwise accumulation model...|$|R
40|$|Numerical and {{analogue}} models {{suggest that}} melt production, its segregation from the solid matrix and subsequent transport and accumulation are highly dynamic and stepwise processes exhibiting scale invariant patterns in both time and length scales, which {{is characteristic of}} self-organized critical systems. This phenomenon is also observed in migmatites at several localities, where the leucosome thickness statistics obey power laws. Stepwise melt transport and deformation-enhanced melt mobility affect melt production dynamics by determining the distribution of extracted <b>melt</b> <b>batch</b> sizes and residence times of melt pockets within the host rock, which in turn would influence the geochemistry of extracted melts. We introduce a numerical approach, which enables qualitative and quantitative assessment {{of the effects of}} stress-induced melt migration and accumulation on the chemistry of partial melts. The model suggests that apart from different sources and melting percentages, deformation can be an important factor in producing geochemical variations within and between intrusive/extrusive complexes...|$|R
40|$|The {{selection}} {{of raw materials}} affects the rate of batch-to-glass conversion. In all-electric melters, foam under the batch blanket limits the heat flux from the molten glass, thus slowing the rate of melting. Our study, in which we compare the melting behaviors of three batches formulated to vitrify high-alumina high-level waste, shows that a slowly dissolving refractory component can cause excessive foaming. Faster <b>melting</b> <b>batches</b> with gibbsite [Al(OH) 3] or boehmite [AlO(OH) ] as an alumina source produced substantially less foaming than a batch with corundum (Al 2 O 3). While gibbsite and boehmite dissolved below 500 °C, corundum was still present in the batch up to 900 °C; hence, the glass-forming melt lacked alumina in the batch with corundum. The low viscosity of that batch caused the open pores to close prematurely at 660 °C, trapping gases and expanding to foam. This would explain the literature-reported slow melting rate of a batch with corundum, as compared to batches with gibbsite and boehmite...|$|R

Our {{results show that the}} observed compositional range of Eoarchean TTGs can be explained by a combination two processes: (1) 5 - 25 % partial melting of amphibolite within thickened mafic crust and (2) subsequent fractional crystallization processes. The Eoarchean TTG suite of SW Greenland probably formed through mixing of <b>melt</b> <b>batches</b> that originally formed at different source depths between 10 and 14 kbar and ponded as plutons at mid-crustal levels. The trace element compositions of some TTGs point to subsequent fractional crystallization processes involving plagioclase, clinopyroxene, amphibole and garnet. Our model is consistent with recent studies proposing that the Eoarchean Itsaq Gneiss Complex TTGs from the IGC formed by re-working of mafic protocrust that stabilized as accreted juvenile crustal terranes in the Eoarchean.

We examine the effects of increasing the melt flux to simulate melt focusing by channeling or by two-dimensional flow with converging melt streamlines. Melt focusing modifies the mineralogy of both residual matrix and erupted melt.

40|$|Abstract: The rate of melt {{segregation}} i regional migmatite terrains can {{be estimated}} by various lines of research. Firstly, the segregation rate of a <b>melt</b> <b>batch,</b> with a volume below the melt percolation threshold, cannot exceed the melt production rate and is therefore limited by the heating rate derived from geothermometry and geochronology (method A). Other estimates come from physical models for melt percolation (method B) and from the degree of (dis) equilibrium reached between melt and source rocks (method C). The first method is restricted by the current ime resolution of isotopic techniques. Results from {{the second and third}} approaches depend heavily on assumed values of melt viscosity and other parameters (B); on the correct recognition of (dis) equilibrium trace element distributions (C); and on the migmatization model used (B and C). The validity of method C is undermined by the mathematical equivalence oftrace element models for five different scenarios: (1) disequilibrium elting (with or without melt escape) followed by in situ crystallization fnon-segregated melt; (2) equilibrium elting, followed by equilibrium crystallization and major melt escape; (3) disequilibrium melting, followed by equilibrium crystallization and minor melt escape; (4) pervasive retrograde re...|$|R

The dykes are classified as the clinopyroxene-bearing (camptonite–I) and clinopyroxene-free (camptonite–II) varieties. Camptonite–I consists of aluminian–ferroan diopside phenocrysts accompanied by kaersutite, subordinate Ti-rich annite, albite to oligoclase and abundant calcite–albite ocelli. Camptonite–II comprises K-rich hastingsite to magnesiohastingsite, Ti-rich annite, albite to andesine, abundant accessory titanite and apatite, and silicate ocelli filled mainly with plagioclase (An 4 - 34).

Previously published U-Pb ages document an episodic crystallisation history from 17 to 11 Ma, with peraluminous (S-type) granitic rocks systematically older than closely associated metaluminous (I-type) granitic rocks. Zircon O- and Hf isotopic data, combined with trace element compositions, are highly variable within and between individual samples, indicative of open-system behaviour involving mantle-derived melts and evolved supracrustal sources. Pronounced compositional and thermal fluctuations highlight the role of magma mixing and mingling, in accord with field observations, and incremental emplacement of distinct <b>melt</b> <b>batches</b> coupled with variable degrees of crustal assimilation. In the course of partial fusion, more fertile supracrustal sources dominated in the earlier stages of Aegean Miocene magmatism, consistent with systematically older crystallisation ages of peraluminous granitic rocks. Differences between zircon saturation and crystallisation temperatures (deduced from zircon Ti concentrations), along with multimodal crystallisation age spectra for individual plutons, highlight the complex and highly variable physico-compositional and thermal evolution of silicic magma systems.

Numerous acid and intermediate-basic dikes intrude the composite intrusive complex of the arc segment and its host-rock assemblage. The silicic dikes of porphyric microgranite, porphyric microgranodiorite and aplite consist of quartz, K-feldspar, plagioclase (albite), biotite and rare amphibole. The dikes are of subaluminous composition with shoshonitic affinity. Trace-element patterns exhibit pronounced negative anomalies of Nb, Ta, Ti, P and Sr together with positive anomalies of Cs, Th, U and La suggesting partial melting of a quartzo-feldspathic crustal source. The intermediate-basic dikes with phonolite, basanite and trachyandesite chemical compositions typically contain pyroxene (diopside-augite) and plagioclase phenocrysts (An 30 - 60) and An 98), calcic amphiboles (magnesiohornblende-magnesiohastingsite), magnesian biotites and alkali-feldspars (Or 95). The rocks show shoshonitic geochemical affinities. Low Ba/Rb ratios and high Rb/Sr ratios suggest that the primary dike melt originated by partial melting of a phlogopite-bearing lithospheric mantle, whereas LILE and LREE enrichment along with low Nb/Zr and Hf/Sm ratios and high Ba/Nb and Rb/Nb ratios imply that these rocks formed at a convergent continental margin.

However, the residual Mg which is commonly measured for production control accounts for both dissolved Mg and Mg combined as oxides and sulfides. To account for the uncertainties associated with such a control, it is quite usual to over treat the melt with the risk of porosity appearance. A new methodology based on thermal analysis has been developed in the present work so as to estimate the amount of free Mg dissolved in the melt ready for pouring. A combination of Te mixture and a new “reactive mixture” composed of sulfur plus a commercial inoculant has been prepared for this purpose. This reactive mixture is able to transform the magnesium remaining dissolved in the melt to combined forms of this element. Experiments performed both during start of production (when Mg overtreatment is usual) and during normal mass production indicate that important variations of free Mg occur without relevant changes in residual Mg content as determined by spectrometry. The method developed in the present work has shown to be highly effective to detect those <b>melt</b> <b>batches</b> where active Mg content is not high enough for guaranteeing a correct nodularity of castings.

The type of batch materials and the size of silica grains determine how much, if any, primary foam occurs during melting. Small quartz grains, 5 {micro}m in size, caused extensive foaming because their major portion dissolved at temperatures 800 C when batch gases no longer evolved. The exothermal reaction of nitrates with sucrose was ignited at a temperature as low as 160 C and caused a temporary jump in temperature of several hundred degrees. Secondary foam, the source of which is oxygen from redox reactions, occurred in all batches of a limited composition variation involving five oxides, B{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }, CaO, Li{sub 2 }O, MgO, and Na{sub 2 }O.

For the comprehensive model, three main sub-models, which include the combustion chamber model, the <b>batch</b> <b>melting</b> model and the glass tank model, were coupled together by an integrated fashion. The sand grain dissolution model, the redox and fining models, as post-models, were coupled with the comprehensive model. The interface temperatures and heat fluxes between the combustion space, the batch blanket, and the glass melt were calculated by a cyclical iterative way. The accuracy of numerical simulation is improved greatly. The comprehensive model may supply very useful information about whole glass furnace {{as long as the}} inlet and the boundary conditions are given. The analysis of furnace performance is therefore possible. The different furnace constructions can be studied. The model constitutes a useful tool for understanding the thermal phenomena occurring in industrial glass furnaces, improving and optimizing furnace design, furnace operation and the glass melt qualityAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|TThe Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ), New Zealand is {{a region}} of voluminous and {{frequent}} rhyolitic volcanism and widespread geothermal activity. Additionally, the hydrothermal systems of the TVZ contain relatively high concentrations of base and precious metals. Here we present an extensive dataset of major element, volatile, and trace element (including Pb, Zn, As, Mo, Cu) abundances in melt inclusions, pumice glasses and minerals from eight eruptions within the Okataina Volcanic Center (OVC) of the TVZ to investigate the behavior of metals during melt evolution. The high-SiO 2 rhyolites of the OVC contain high concentrations of volatiles (≤ 6 wt % H 2 O, ≤ 0 · 25 wt % Cl) and underwent significant degassing prior to and during eruption. The OVC melts contain moderate concentrations of metals (11 – 24 ppm Pb, 20 – 50 ppm Zn, 2 – 7 ppm As, < 2 · 5 ppm Mo, <~ 5 ppm Cu). Ferromagnesian minerals (amphibole, biotite and orthopyroxene) in the OVC pumice have high concentrations of Zn (≤ 1500 ppm), and plagioclase and biotite contain moderate amounts of Pb (≤ 11 ppm). The melt inclusion and pumice glass trace element data reveal complex histories of magma mixing and mingling prior to eruption; however, discrete <b>melt</b> <b>batches</b> are easily identified based on trace element geochemistry. Variations in incompatible trace elements within these <b>melt</b> <b>batches</b> suggest that the OVC rhyolites underwent at least ∼ 20 – 25 % fractional crystallization during quartz crystallization and melt inclusion entrapment (at pressures of ∼ 100 – 200 MPa) and little to no crystallization (≤ 5 %) during ascent and eruption. Comparison of melt inclusion metal and incompatible element (e. g. U) concentrations reveals that melt Pb, Mo and As increase, whereas melt Zn decreases, during fractional crystallization at depth (∼ 100 – 200 MPa). These observations {{can be explained by}} minor partitioning of the metals Pb, Mo and As into the fractionating minerals and stronger partitioning of Zn into the ferromagnesian phases, supported by calculated metal D values and analyzed metal concentrations in OVC minerals. Interestingly, throughout both deep, vapor-saturated crystallization and during extensive degassing during magma ascent and eruption (as recorded by pumice glasses), the metals analyzed here do not appear to partition appreciably into the vapor. We propose that the lack of volatility of the metals analyzed in this study can be attributed to a combination of several factors. First, vapor–melt partitioning requires the presence of ligands—commonly Cl, S and OH—with which the metals may complex. Given the low Cl/H 2 O ratios in the OVC melts and the extensive degassing of H 2 O compared with Cl, {{it seems likely that the}} rhyolites would have exsolved H 2 O-rich vapor with insufficient Cl to transport metals (in particular Pb and Zn) into the vapor phase, either at depth or during magma ascent. Second, the overall small volumes of vapor present during crystallization at pressures of 100 – 200 MPa would have impeded significant vapor–melt partitioning of the metals. Finally, the estimated very rapid ascent of the OVC melts from depths of 4 – 8 km suggests that there was insufficient time at low pressure for diffusion of metals out of the melt. These results imply that there may be an indirect connection between the rhyolites and the metals of the hydrothermal systems of the TVZ. As the metals, and other species such as Cl, remain in the rhyolitic magmas upon eruption, they are available in the large volumes of rhyolite emplaced in the upper crust of the TVZ for leaching by heated meteoric waters...|$|R

500|$|In the United States, {{two systems}} were {{used during the}} 1890s to create molten glass. The older system used a pot furnace, where ceramic pots were heated inside the furnace to <b>melt</b> the <b>batch</b> of {{ingredients}} {{needed to make the}} molten glass. The newer system used a large brick tank that could be operated continuously or by the batch. [...] The Hartford City plant used the tank system, and it was originally the [...] "largest tank window glass factory in the world". [...] The tank had a capacity equivalent to 30 pots, giving the Hartford City plant more than double the capacity of some of the window glass plants built a few years earlier in Ohio.|$|R
40|$|The newly {{developed}} “MTS 1500 ” Melt Treatment System is performing the specifi cally required melt treatment operations like degassing, cleaning, modification and/or grain refinement by an automated process in one step {{and at the}} same location. This linked process is saving time, energy and metal losses allowing - by automated dosage of the melt treatment agents - the production of a consistent <b>melt</b> quality <b>batch</b> after batch. By linking the MTS Metal Treatment System with sensors operating on-line in the melt, i. e., with a hydrogen sensor “Alspek H”, a fully automated control of parts of the process chain like degassing is possible. This technology does guarantee a pre-specifi ed and documented melt quality in each <b>melt</b> treatment <b>batch.</b> Furthermore, to ensure that castings are consistent and predictable there is a growing realization that critical parameters such as metal cleanliness must be measured prior to casting. There exists accepted methods for measuring the cleanliness of an aluminum melt but these can be both slow and costly. A simple, rapid and meaningful method of measuring and bench marking the cleanliness of an aluminum melt has been developed to offer the foundry a practical method of measuring melt cleanliness. This paper shows the structure and performance of the integrated MTS melt treatment process and documents achieved melt quality standards after degassing, cleaning, modifi cation and grain refi nement operations under real foundry conditions. It also provides an insight on a melt cleanliness measuring device “Alspek MQ” to provide foundry men better tools in meeting the increasing quality and tighter specifi cation demand from the industry...|$|R

5000|$|According to art {{historian}} Martha Drexler Lynn, [...] "Labino had a life-long love of tools, inventing and problem-solving which he {{coupled with a}} passion for artistic endeavors..." [...] His interest in blowing glass began in the 1930s, when he ran the Owens-Illinois milk bottling plant. There he had a laboratory in which he created glass formulas. In 1940, his predecessor at the plant, Ben Alderson, showed Labino how to blow glass. Labino later blew glass as a hobby; at Johns-Manville he built a home glass furnace at which to pursue the craft. An early project was a glass paperweight that he created in 1958 for a friend's retirement. By 1960 he had <b>melted</b> a <b>batch</b> of glass and created a primitive blowpipe.|$|R
