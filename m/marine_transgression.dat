25|$|The {{contact between}} the Tapeats Sandstone and Bass Formation {{and the rest of}} the folded and faulted Unkar Group is a {{prominent}} angular unconformity, which is part of the Great Unconformity. The differential erosion of the Unkar Group left resistant beds of the Cardenas Basalt and Shinumo Quartzite as topographic highs, ancient monadnocks, that are now buried by sandstones, shales, and conglomerates of the Tapeats Sandstone. These monadnocks served locally as sources of coarse-grained sediments during the <b>marine</b> <b>transgression</b> that deposited the Tapeats Sandstone and other members of the Tonto Group. The {{contact between the}} Bass Formation and the Tapeats Sandstone forms part of a relative flat surface that lies between the monadnocks.|$|E
25|$|During the Oligocene and Early Miocene large swathes of Patagonia {{were subject}} to a <b>marine</b> <b>{{transgression}}.</b> The transgression might have temporarily linked the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as inferred from the findings of marine invertebrate fossils of both Atlantic and Pacific affinity in La Cascada Formation. Connection would have occurred through narrow epicontinental seaways that formed channels in a dissected topography. The Antarctic Plate started to subduct beneath South America 14 million {{years ago in the}} Miocene forming the Chile Triple Junction. At first the Antarctic Plate subducted only in the southernmost tip of Patagonia, meaning that the Chile Triple Junction was located near the Strait of Magellan. As the southern part of Nazca Plate and the Chile Rise became consumed by subduction the more northerly regions of the Antarctic Plate begun to subduct beneath Patagonia so that the Chile Triple Junction advanced to the north over time. The asthenospheric window associated to the triple junction disturbed previous patterns of mantle convection beneath Patagonia inducing an uplift of ca. 1km that reversed the Miocene transgression.|$|E

25|$|The {{geological}} {{age of the}} Caribbean Sea {{is estimated}} to be between 160 and 180million years and was formed by a horizontal fracture that split the supercontinent called Pangea in the Mesozoic Era. It is assumed the proto-caribbean basin existed in the Devonian period. In the early Carboniferous movement of Gondwana to the north and its convergence with the Euramerica basin decreased in size. The next stage of the Caribbean Sea's formation began in the Triassic. Powerful rifting {{led to the formation of}} narrow troughs, stretching from modern Newfoundland to the west coast of the Gulf of Mexico which formed siliciclastic sedimentary rocks. In the early Jurassic due to powerful <b>marine</b> <b>transgression,</b> water broke into the present area of the Gulf of Mexico creating a vast shallow pool. The emergence of deep basins in the Caribbean occurred during the Middle Jurassic rifting. The emergence of these basins marked the beginning of the Atlantic Ocean and contributed to the destruction of Pangaea at the end of the late Jurassic. During the Cretaceous the Caribbean acquired the shape close to that seen today. In the early Paleogene due to Marine regression the Caribbean became separated from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean by the land of Cuba and Haiti. The Caribbean remained like this for most of the Cenozoic until the Holocene when rising water levels of the oceans restored communication with the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
500|$|The Bückeberg Group, {{from which}} Brancasaurus originates, likely {{represented}} a large, continental freshwater lake that the surrounding uplands drained into. In turn, the lake itself was temporarily {{connected to the}} Boreal Sea via a passage to the west. During the time at which the layers of [...] "Wealden 5" [...] and [...] "Wealden 6" [...] were deposited, the lake expanded and became more brackish {{as a result of}} <b>marine</b> <b>transgression.</b> The deposited sediments probably represent the oxygen-poor bottom portion of the lake, with the plesiosaurs of the Bückeberg Group being presumably preserved after they sank through the water column to the bottom.|$|E
2500|$|The Maevarano Formation is {{interpreted}} as a low-relief alluvial plain that over time was covered by a <b>marine</b> <b>transgression.</b> [...] Broad, shallow rivers flowed to the northwest from central highlands; evidence for debris flows suggests that the discharges of the rivers varied greatly, with periods of dilute water flow, and periods of rapid erosion dumping sediment into the channels. Paleosols are reddish and include root casts. [...] The paleosols and other sedimentologic evidence indicate well-drained floodplains with abundant vegetation adapted to a relatively dry climate, strongly seasonal (rainy and dry seasons) and at times semiarid (not unlike the present climate of the area).|$|E
50|$|Jurassic coal-bearing basins {{were formed}} in north central Queensland, with {{significant}} marine platform cover extending across most of central Australia.Continued passive-margin subsidence and <b>marine</b> <b>transgressions</b> in the Perth Basin of Western Australia continued, with the Jurassic Cattamarra Coal Measures a notable fluvial terrigenous {{formation of the}} Jurassic.|$|R
50|$|Because <b>marine</b> <b>transgressions</b> cover distances, over time, the coeval {{units are}} {{separated}} by distance, and type of deposition material; the local subsidence, or uplift, as well as glaciation, and sea level changes, can cause variations in the deposition sequences of transgression-regressions. The ocean was {{to the west of}} the proto-North American continent, but also northwest, or southwest.|$|R
25|$|Subsequent <b>marine</b> <b>transgressions</b> were {{responsible}} for secondary sedimentation in the basins. There was widening of the gorges and erosion of the cliffs from runoff, leading {{to the formation of}} the Molasses in the Royans and also in the valleys of Lans, Autrans, and Rencurel. At the close of the Miocene, a new period of uplifting brought about the final receding of the sea.|$|R
2500|$|The {{overlying}} Tonto Group {{is separated}} from the Dox Sandstone {{and the rest of}} folded and faulted Unkar Group by a prominent angular unconformity, {{which is part of the}} Great Unconformity. Typically, the surface of this unconformity is a remarkably flat, ancient erosional surface, often argued to be a peneplain, that cuts across units such as the Bass Formation, Hatakai Shale, and Dox Sandstone. Resistant beds within the Unkar Group, such as Cardenas Basalt and Shinumo Quartzite, form ancient hills, called monadnocks, that rise as much as [...] high above this ancient plain. Thin drapes of Tapeats Sandstone of the Tonto Group now cover most of these ancient monadnocks. However, a few of these monadnocks protrude up into the Bright Angel Shale. These monadnocks served locally as sources of coarse-grained sediments that accumulated during the <b>marine</b> <b>transgression</b> to form the Tonto Group.|$|E
2500|$|The {{contact between}} the Tonto Group and Unkar Group is a {{prominent}} angular unconformity, {{which is part of}} the Great Unconformity. The surface of this angular unconformity truncates dipping strata comprising the folded and faulted Unkar Group. Though this surface is typically a plane, differential erosion of the tilted strata of the Unkar Group left resistant beds of the upper layer Cardenas Basalt and the middle layer Shinumo Quartzite as ancient hills, called monadnocks. These ancient hills, which are ridges formed by block faulting, are up to [...] tall. Thin drapes of Tapeats Sandstone of the Tonto Group either cover or drape onto most of these ancient monadnocks. However, the summits of the highest monadnocks protrude up through the base layer Tapeats Sandstone and are blanketed by overlying Bright Angel Shale as can be seen at Isis Temple. Lava Butte is a partially exhumed prehistoric monadnock associated with this unconformity that consists of Cardenas Basalt. These monadnocks served locally as sources of coarse-grained sediments during the <b>marine</b> <b>transgression</b> that deposited the Tapeats Sandstone (Tapeats Sea), and other members of the Tonto Group.|$|E
2500|$|... {{indicate}} that, {{except for}} the Hotauta Member, it accumulated beneath a sea that transgressed from the west. The Hotauta Member consists of fluvial sands and gravels that accumulated within valleys on an eroded surface of the Vishnu Basement Rocks. The quartzite gravel indicates that the conglomerates of the Hotauta Member were deposited by river systems that extended some unknown distance outside of the Grand Canyon region. Marine sediments buried the fluvial deposits of the Hotauta Member as a smooth surface, with a local relief of probably no more than [...] of the Vishnu Basement Rocks, being submerged by a <b>marine</b> <b>transgression</b> from the west. The dolomite of the Bass Formation likely was originally deposited as limestone and subsequently altered to dolomite by later diagenesis. This limestone largely accumulated in clear, relatively warm, shallow marine waters by both biological and abiological processes. During the maximum, deepest, incursion of marine waters, limestone and deep-water mud accumulated in the western Grand Canyon, while stromatolites and shallow-water mud accumulated in the eastern Grand Canyon. Following the maximum incursion of marine waters, the sea slowly regressed and it accumulated in nearshore and coastal environments as indicated by ripple marks, mudcracks, oxidized shales, and other evidence of periodic subaerial exposure found in {{the upper part of}} the Bass Formation. Evaporite-forming conditions probably occurred, also during this regressive phase. Eventually, a shallow, near-shore marine environment, coastal plain mudflats, and deltas that marked the beginning of Hakatai Shale deposition [...] dominated the Grand Canyon area.|$|E
50|$|Initially, {{sea levels}} were high, but as Gondwana moved south, ice {{accumulated}} into glaciers and sea levels dropped. At first, low-lying sea beds increased diversity, but later glaciation led to mass extinctions as the seas drained and continental shelves became dry land.

2500|$|Second, the {{environment}} in the low-lying coastal regions of northwestern Europe began to lower c. 250 and gradually receded over the next 200 years.

If there had been any Frisii left in Frisia, they would have drowned.|$|R
50|$|Rudites can be {{deposited}} {{in a variety}} of nonmarine and marine environments. In nonmarine settings, gravels, which later were lithified to become rudites, accumulated within fluvial channels, within alluvial fans, and as glacial deposits. In marine environments, rudites were deposited along shorelines as part of beaches, as basal conglomerates during <b>marine</b> <b>transgressions,</b> and in the deep sea by slumps and turbidites. Rudites composed largely of rounded siliciclastic gravel are conglomerates and others composed of angular siliciclastic gravel are breccias.|$|R

50|$|An inland sea (also {{known as}} an epeiric sea or an epicontinental sea) is a shallow sea that covers central areas of continents during periods of high sea level that result in <b>marine</b> <b>transgressions.</b> In modern times, continents stand high, {{eustatic}} sea levels are low, and there are few inland seas, none larger than the Caspian Sea.

5000|$|Walther's Law of Facies, {{or simply}} Walther's Law, {{named after the}} {{geologist}} Johannes Walther (1860-1937), states that the vertical succession of facies reflects lateral changes in environment. Conversely, it states that when a depositional environment [...] "migrates" [...] laterally, sediments of one depositional environment come to lie on top of another. In Russia the law is known as Golovkinsky-Walther's Law, honoring also Nikolai A. Golovkinsky(1834-1897). A classic example of this law is the vertical stratigraphic succession that typifies <b>marine</b> <b>transgressions</b> and regressions.|$|R
