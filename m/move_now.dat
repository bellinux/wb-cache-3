500|$|Fischer made {{numerous}} lasting {{contributions to}} chess. In the 1990s, he patented a modified chess timing system that added a time increment after each <b>move,</b> <b>now</b> a standard practice in top tournament and match play. He also invented Fischerandom, a new variant of chess {{known today as}} [...] "Chess960".|$|E
500|$|Two {{days after}} Bennett's October 31, 2007 {{deadline}} passed for public financing {{of a new}} arena, he informed NBA commissioner David Stern that the ownership group intended to move the Sonics to Oklahoma City {{as soon as it}} was legally possible. The timing of the announcement, one day after the Sonics' home opener, drew critical comments from Tom Carr, Seattle's attorney, who said [...] "Mr. Bennett's announcement today is a transparent attempt to alienate the Seattle fan base and follow through on his plan to move the team to Oklahoma City ... Making this <b>move</b> <b>now</b> continues the current ownership's insulting behavior toward the Sonics' dedicated fans and the citizens of the city." [...] Bennett also reiterated that the team was not for sale and dismissed attempts by local groups to repurchase the team.|$|E

2500|$|According to American {{journalist}} Selwyn Raab, the Noe-Schultz operation, {{which had}} begun to flourish in the Bronx, became the only non-Italian gang able to rival those who would become {{the heads of the}} Mafia's Five Families. It now expanded over to Manhattan's Upper West Side into the neighborhoods of Washington Heights, Yorkville, and Harlem. Schultz and Noe moved their headquarters from the Bronx to what {{is said to have been}} East 149th Street in Manhattan; however, the gang's <b>move</b> <b>now</b> brought them into direct competition with Irish-American gangster Jack [...] "Legs" [...] Diamond. A full-scale war soon broke out between the rival gangs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{court upheld}} the FCC's {{authority}} to regulate broadband providers to encourage nationwide broadband deployment, agreeing with the FCC's interpretation of section 706 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. Some legal observers believe this should allow the FCC to reclassify broadband providers as [...] "telecommunications services" [...] and therefore subject them to common carrier regulation. Legal scholar Annemarie Bridy predicted that the case will force the FCC's hand in reclassifying broadband providers as [...] "telecommunications services," [...] something which the FCC has so far resisted doing. Legal scholar Susan P. Crawford also wrote that the FCC should <b>move</b> <b>now</b> to regulate broadband providers as common carriers {{in order to preserve}} network neutrality and civic life in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 October 1949, the 62nd {{received}} its first four-engine Douglas C-54 Skymaster transport. By Thanksgiving {{of that same}} year, the Wing was equipped entirely with C-54s, and its designation was changed from 62nd Troop Carrier Wing (Medium), to (Heavy). On 1 June 1950, the Wing was inactivated due to budget reductions. [...] However, {{as a result of}} the Korean War, on 17 September 1951, the Wing was once again activated at McChord AFB. Shortly thereafter, the Group and its three flying squadrons, the 4th, 7th, and 8th, again assigned to the Wing, returned to McChord. Not two years had passed, however, before the Wing was once again on the <b>move.</b> <b>Now</b> flying the Douglas C-124 Globemaster II.|$|E

2500|$|The army did {{not gain}} {{the support of}} several key bodies. The Great Council of Chiefs, on 7 December, called the coup illegal and called upon {{soldiers}} to [...] "leave the barracks and return home to your people" [...] The President of the Methodist Church of Fiji and Rotuma led a delegation to visit and support the Prime Minister while he was under effective house arrest. The Archbishop of the Anglican Church issued a statement opposing the coup. Churches took out newspaper ads including one quoting Reverend Tuikilakila Waqairatu, president of the Fiji Council of Churches, saying [...] "We are deeply convinced that the <b>move</b> <b>now</b> taken by the commander and his advisers is the manifestation of darkness and evil". Roman Catholic Archbishop Petero Mataca took a more nuanced position, however. [...] In {{a letter to the}} Fiji Sun on 10 December, he condemned the coup, but also claimed that the government had pursued policies that had led to it. Part of this statement was quoted in Fiji Village on 12 December.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} stages of an incident, first {{responders}} may be overwhelmed by the scope of patients and injuries. One valuable technique is the Patient Assist Method (PAM). [...] The responders quickly establish a casualty collection point (CCP) and advise, either by yelling, or over a loudspeaker, that [...] "anyone requiring assistance should move to the selected area (CCP)". This does several things at once, it identifies patients that are not so severely injured, that they need immediate help, it physically clears the scene, and provides possible assistants to the responders. As those who can move, do so, the responders then ask, [...] "anyone who still needs assistance, yell out or raise your hands"; this further identifies patients who are responsive, yet maybe unable to <b>move.</b> <b>Now</b> the responders can rapidly assess the remaining patients who are either expectant, or are in need of immediate aid. From that point the first responder is quickly able to identify those in need of immediate attention, while not being distracted or overwhelmed by the magnitude of the situation. [...] Using this method assumes the ability to hear. [...] Deaf, partially deaf, or victims of a large blast injury {{may not be able to}} hear these instructions.|$|E
