5|$|Obesity {{prevention}} {{programs have been}} found to reduce the cost of treating obesity-related disease. However, the longer people live, the more <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> they incur. Researchers, therefore, conclude that reducing obesity may improve the public's health, but it is unlikely to reduce overall health spending.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> {{attributable}} to obesity in the US were an estimated $190.2billion or 20.6% of all medical expenditures, while {{the cost of}} obesity in Canada was estimated at CA$2 billion in 1997 (2.4% of total health costs). The total annual direct cost of overweight and obesity in Australia in 2005 was A$21 billion. Overweight and obese Australians also received A$35.6 billion in government subsidies. The estimate range for annual expenditures on diet products is $40billion to $100billion in the US alone.|$|E

40|$|Objectives This study {{examined}} the prevalence of cerebral palsy (CP) in South Korea, and the attributable lifetime <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> according to physiological types and extent of involvement. Methods The number of medical service use and <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> of CP {{were obtained from the}} national health insurance review and assessment (HIRA) service. The prevalence was calculated from the number of five-year-old patients who used medical services between 2004 and 2008. The lifetime <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> of CP was calculated from the data and discount rate of 3 %. Results The prevalence of CP in South Korea was 2. 6 per 1000 children. The attributable lifetime <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> of CP in South Korea was calculated to be 26, 383 US dollars, which is 1. 8 times the basic lifetime <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> of the general population (14, 579 US dollars). Spastic CP showed the highest attributable <b>medical</b> <b>cost,</b> followed by dyskinetic and ataxic CP. Spastic diplegia showed 1. 4 times of the attributable lifetime <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> of spastic hemiplegia. Conclusions The prevalence of CP in South Korea is comparable to that in other countries. CP is a disease with wide range of clinical features, and the <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> according to the physiological types and extent of involvement should be considered.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{economic}} impact of Lyme disease (LD), the most common vectorborne inflammatory disease in the United States, cost data were collected in 5 counties of the Maryland Eastern Shore from 1997 to 2000. Patients were divided into 5 diagnosis groups, clinically defined early-stage LD, clinically defined late-stage LD, suspected LD, tick bite, and other related complaints. From 1997 to 2000, the mean per patient direct <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> of early-stage LD decreased from $ 1, 609 to $ 464 (p< 0. 05), and the mean per patient direct <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> of late-stage LD decreased from $ 4, 240 to $ 1, 380 (p< 0. 05).

5|$|The various health {{problems}} associated with long-term alcohol consumption are generally perceived as detrimental to society, for example, money due to lost labor-hours, <b>medical</b> <b>costs</b> due to injuries due to drunkenness and organ damage from long-term use, and secondary treatment costs, such as the costs of rehabilitation facilities and detoxification centers. Alcohol use is a major contributing factor for head injuries, motor vehicle accidents (due to drunk driving), domestic violence, and assaults. Beyond the financial costs that alcohol consumption imposes, there are also significant social costs to both the alcoholic and their family and friends. For instance, alcohol consumption by a pregnant woman can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome, an incurable and damaging condition. Estimates of the economic costs of alcohol abuse, collected by the World Health Organization, vary from one to six percent of a country's GDP. One Australian estimate pegged alcohol's social costs at 24% of all drug abuse costs; a similar Canadian study concluded alcohol's share was 41%. One study quantified {{the cost to the}} UK of all forms of alcohol misuse in 2001 as £18.5–20 billion. All economic costs in the United States in 2006 have been estimated at $223.5 billion.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine whether the implementation of the helmet law had reduced the likelihood of head injury and the associated <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> in Taiwan.

40|$|Introduction: Maxillofacial trauma due {{to motor}} vehicle {{accidents}} had increased the clinical burden {{of health care}} institutions. Economic evaluation on the management of maxillofacial trauma had been studied in many countries. Information related to the factors associated {{with the cost of}} managing maxillofacial trauma is worth explored. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to determine the total direct <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> of managing maxillofacial trauma caused by motor vehicle accidents and the associated factors. Patients and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 73 participants treated for maxillofacial trauma due to motor vehicle accidents at Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia from 1 st January 2010 to 31 st December 2010. The outcome variable was total direct <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> consisted of the sum of macro-cost and micro-cost. The association between total direct <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> and study factors (socio-demographic factors, mode of injury and clinical characteristics) were analyzed using general linear regression. Box-Cox transformation was used to transform total direct <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> in the regression analysis. Results: The median total direct <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> was RM 5, 899. 51 and ranged from RM 82 to RM 1. 5 million. The average cost per-person was RM 58, 398. 20. The cost consisted 97. 3 and 2. 7 percent of macro-cost and micro-cost respectively. Factors significantly associated with the transformed total direct <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> were the length of stay in hospital (regression coefficient 0. 08, 95 % confidence interval 0. 03, 0. 12; P= 0. 001), number of facial soft tissue injury (regression coefficient - 1. 08, 95 % confidence interval - 1. 78, - 0. 38; P= 0. 003) and number of maxillofacial fracture (regression coefficient 1. 64, 95 % confidence interval 0. 44, 2. 84; P= 0. 008). Length of stay was found interacted with other significant factors. The cost associated with length of stay was different in each number of maxillofacial fracture and soft tissue injury. Conclusion: In conclusion, length of stay in hospital, number of maxillofacial fracture and number of facial soft tissue injury were significantly associated with total direct <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> of managing maxillofacial trauma caused by motor vehicle accident...|$|R

40|$|Background and {{objective}} Although {{the cost of}} treating women with breast cancer (BC) {{is an important component}} for cost saving and effectiveness in relation to the benefits of BC treatment interventions, there is limited information on the direct cost reported for BC in Lithuania. Therefore the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate annual direct <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> for newly diagnosed BC in Lithuania in the year 2011. Materials and methods The retrospective incidence-based top-down direct cost analysis was used. From 1 st January to 31 st December 2011 incident cases of BC (N = 1142) registered by the National Health Insurance Fund, the stage determined by Lithuanian Cancer Registry were included in the study. Results The total average direct cost of BC amounted per patient was 2580 (95 % CI 2444 – 2752) EUR in 2011. The main cost driver per BC patients was the inpatient hospital stay, respectively 1655 (95 % CI 14775 – 2334) EUR. The average outpatient cost for one BC patient was 564 (95 % CI 547 – 898) EUR. The dominant proportion of inpatient expenditures was assigned to BC surgery and chemotherapy treatment. The BC direct <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> increased according to the diagnosed stage of diseases from 2409 (95 % CI 2196 – 2621) EUR in stage 1 to 3688 (95 % CI 2703 – 4672) EUR in stage 4.

The resulting estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal with easily estimated variance–covariance matrices. The proposed methodology can be used when the cost database contains only the total costs for those with complete follow-up. More efficient estimators are available when the cost data are recorded in multiple time intervals. A study on the <b>medical</b> <b>cost</b> for ovarian cancer is presented...|$|R
