5|$|Liechtenstein {{formally}} {{came into}} existence on 23 January 1719, when Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor decreed the lordship of Schellenberg and the countship of Vaduz united and raised to the dignity of a principality. Liechtenstein {{was a part of}} the Holy Roman Empire until the Treaty of Pressburg was signed on 26 December 1805; this marked Liechtenstein's formal independence, though it was a member of the Confederation of the Rhine and the German Confederation afterwards. While Liechtenstein was still closely aligned with Austria-Hungary until World War I, it realigned its politics and its customs and <b>monetary</b> <b>institutions</b> with Switzerland instead. Having been a constitutional monarchy since 1921, Hans-Adam II demanded more influence in Liechtenstein's politics in the early 21st century, which he was granted in a referendum held on 16 March 2003, effectively making Liechtenstein a semi-constitutional monarchy again. However, the constitutional changes also provide for the possibility of a referendum to abolish the monarchy entirely. The current monarch is Hans-Adam II, who turned over the day-to-day governing decisions to his son and heir Alois, Hereditary Prince of Liechtenstein on 15 August 2004.|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the idea of activating information in memory, Hull et al. presented an example of how information is activated. They referred to the sentence [...] "The robber took the money from the bank". In English, the word bank has two applicable meanings {{in the context of this}} sentence (<b>monetary</b> <b>institution</b> and river shore). However, the <b>monetary</b> <b>institution</b> meaning of the word is more highly activated in this context due to the addition of the words robber and money to the sentence, because they are associatively relevant and therefore pull the <b>monetary</b> <b>institution</b> definition for bank into working memory. Once information is added to working memory, meanings and associations are more easily drawn. Therefore, the meaning of this example sentence is almost universally understood.|$|R

Japan, China, Turkey, and several Latin American countries requested missions, while the U.S. Government also initiated missions, particularly to Central America and the Caribbean when the U.S. felt that U.S. interests might be affected failed elections, excessive debt, infectious diseases, or other crises.

30|$|As {{regards the}} {{security}} layers, {{on the one}} hand, Fig.  6 shows that the largest fraction of securities held by <b>Monetary</b> Financial <b>Institutions</b> excluding the Eurosystem, amounting to 1.61 trillion euros, were issued by General Governments, followed by debt securities issued by <b>Monetary</b> Financial <b>Institutions</b> excluding the Eurosystem (1.13 trillion euros), Rest of the World (1.06 trillion euros), and Other Financial Institutions (1.00 trillion euros). Non-financial Corporations and Insurance Corporations and Pension Funds play only a minor role as issuing counterparties of the securities held by <b>Monetary</b> Financial <b>Institutions</b> excluding the Eurosystem. The fact that General Governments {{play a key role}} as an issuing counterparty of the securities held by <b>Monetary</b> Financial <b>Institutions</b> excluding the Eurosystem could be explained as follows. The expectation of the public security purchases by the Eurosystem and the subsequent increase in the prices of the purchased securities may have generated an increase in the purchases of public securities by the private banking sector in order to sell them to the Eurosystem. However, our data, being data on holdings and issuances, are not able to provide empirical evidence of the aforementioned speculation. On the other hand, with particular reference to the APP securities, as we can see from Fig.  7, {{at the end of the}} second quarter of 2017, the largest fraction of APP securities held by the Eurosystem was issued by the institutional sector General Governments, amounting to 1.61 trillion euros, followed by securities issued by <b>Monetary</b> Financial <b>Institutions</b> excluding the Eurosystem (0.31 trillion euros), and Non-Financial Corporations (0.04 trillion euros). In fact, the majority of purchases carried out by the Eurosystem within the APP until now have been public sector security purchases (European Central Bank 2017 a).|$|R

50|$|Immediately {{after the}} Civil War during Reconstruction, there were large capital inflows into the United States {{and a general}} {{improvement}} in the export-to-import ratio since the export-dominant South was reintegrated with the North. The United States Treasury, however, had increased its cash balance through the summer of 1873 by selling gold for $14 million. National banks also increased issuance of national bank notes by $44 million. The failure of several railroad companies including Jay Cooke & Company on their bond obligations encouraged capital outflows from the United States to Europe and weakened demand for dollars leading to the Panic of 1873. Increased Treasury cash balances, continued issuance of national bank notes, and capital outflows together depreciated the currency. These factors further caused a reduction in reserves held by <b>monetary</b> <b>institutions</b> because higher prices increased domestic demand for currency. Reserves held by banks were insufficient {{to be able to}} meet seasonal demands in autumn of 1873 as greenback reserves declined from $34 million in September 1873 to $5 million in October 1873. Tensions surrounding the Panic of 1873 between creditors and debtors revived the specie payment resumption debate.|$|E
5000|$|A {{few cases}} of full {{currency}} substitution prior to 1999 {{had been the}} consequence of political and historical factors. In all long-standing currency substitution cases, historical and political reasons have been more influential than {{an evaluation of the}} economic effects of currency substitution. Panama adopted the US dollar as legal tender after independence {{as the result of a}} constitutional ruling. Ecuador and El Salvador became fully dollarized economies in 2000 and 2001 respectively, for different reasons. Ecuador underwent currency substitution to deal with a widespread political and financial crisis resulting from massive loss of confidence in its political and <b>monetary</b> <b>institutions.</b> By contrast, El Salvador's official currency substitution was a result of internal debates and in a context of stable macroeconomic fundamentals and long-standing unofficial currency substitution. The eurozone adopted the euro (€) as its common currency and sole legal tender in 1999, which might be considered a variety of full-commitment regime similar to full currency substitution despite some evident differences from other currency substitutions.

5000|$|According to Milton Friedman (1987) Laughlin’s {{scholarly}} work [...] "was {{almost entirely}} {{in the field of}} money and banking." [...] Friedman summarized:Much of it, notably his History of Bimetallism in the United States (1885), consisted of a thorough and extremely careful presentation of historical evidence on the development of money and <b>monetary</b> <b>institutions.</b> But Laughlin also wrote extensively on monetary and banking theory, and on proposals for monetary reform. His work on these topics was marred by a dogmatic and rigid opposition to the quantity theory of money, an opposition that developed out of his public activities opposing the free silver movement. The proponents of free silver used a crude form of the quantity theory to support their position, which sufficed to render the theory anathema to Laughlin.And furthermore:Laughlin’s attack on the quantity theory had much in common with recent cost-push or structural or supply-shock theories of inflation, in emphasizing the role of factors affecting specific goods and services rather than general monetary influences. Then, as now, such theories ran against the major stream of monetary analysis as exemplified in Laughlin’s time by the work of Irving Fisher. As a result, his writings on theory have had no lasting influence on economic thought.|$|E

Due to constant preoccupation from the most important <b>monetary</b> <b>institution,</b> the Romanian Leu has performed rather well compared to rest of the macroeconomic picture and seems to drag forward the whole set of other indicators, including economic aspects such as competitiveness.
