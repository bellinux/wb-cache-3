40|$|Adequate {{nutrient}} intake is indispensible {{in maintaining}} athletes’ health and improving match fitness. When providing nutrition guidance to athletes, {{it is necessary}} to create improvement targets through discussions between the athlete and mentor, based on each athlete’s physical condition and dietary intake. In this study we aimed to develop a functional personal health <b>management</b> <b>chart</b> as a medium for nutrition education. Physical condition measurements, blood tests, physical activity measurements, and dietary intake surveys (including snacks, water, and supplements), were carried out for 24 males belonging to a top amateur soccer team. Food consciousness and attained levels of the required nutritional knowledge for athletes were also investigated for each player. The personal health <b>management</b> <b>chart</b> was created in a format that allows confirmation of change over time, based on the assessment results of each player. In relation to diet, it was made possible to assess current condition by creating an appropriate range for each subject based on the dietary goals of energy, nutrient and food group intake as recommended by the Japan Sports Association, and Dietary Reference Intakes for Japanese. Furthermore, we grouped the subjects according to their attained knowledge level regarding sports nutrition, and used it as an index in selecting a nutritional education method for each subject. By integrating these results, it became possible to set improvement goals for each subject and display them on the chart. In the future, we aim to provide guidance using the chart many times, constantly making improvements, while creating a chart {{that can be used for}} nutrition education in all sporting disciplines...|$|E

40|$|This article quantifies {{the growth}} in the number of {{professional}} accountants in British <b>management,</b> <b>charts</b> their influence over the past century, and analyses the causes. It is most likely that Britain initially spawned large numbers of accountants because of the particular nature of its capital market which led to demands for the independent auditing of company accounts. British companies then recruited their accountants from this ever growing pool of professionally qualified auditors and the reason why these accountants rose to the top in British management was probably that the profession provided virtually the only formal management training available in Britain...|$|R

She developed significant side effects (dizziness, nausea, edema) with medications for pain <b>management.</b> <b>Chart</b> review revealed a history of similar intolerance to multiple antiretrovirals, which was not explained by known cardiac or gastrointestinal disease or psychological factors. Specialized testing revealed the presence of an autonomic neuropathy, which provided an explanation for her medication intolerance. The patient was educated on the symptoms of autonomic neuropathy and its relationship to DSP and subsequent symptomatic medications were initiated at the lowest possible doses. Although symptom management remained challenging, the patient exhibited lower frustration and greater acceptance of medication trials. Review of 168 advanced stage HIV infected individuals demonstrated that 81 % experienced at least one, and 33 % three or more, symptoms potentially attributable to autonomic neuropathy. Potentially autonomic symptoms were significantly associated with the presence of symptomatic DSP. Autonomic neuropathy is difficult to diagnose without specialized testing, as its symptoms are non-specific and overlap with a large number of somatic disorders. The high prevalence of autonomic-type symptoms in chronic HIV, and their association with peripheral neuropathy, may warrant further investigation of the potential for autonomic dysfunction in individuals with HIV-related symptomatic DSP...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{research}} {{over the}} last decade supports the premise that the presence of pain lengthens recovery and impedes healing of patients following surgery. A program on pain management may improve pain management of post surgical patients. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the effects of a continuing education program on pain management practices of nurses working on post surgical units in one Midwest hospital. The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) guidelines for Acute Pain Management will be used as a framework for pain management practices and serve as guidelines for the educational program. The anticipated sample size for surgical patients is 60 patients over a 4 -month period. The 18 nurses attending the program will be from the surgical units.

40|$|The {{terms of}} {{reference}} required the Review to consider among other things management and governance structures. This sequence of interviews was aimed at exploring the framework {{for the management of}} research within the University: what staff take on; what the university expects them to deliver, subject to what requirements on quality, standards, processes and procedures; what are the associated financial disciplines; and how all this is communicated to staff. Overview of the process 2. Ian McCormick explained that REE had been the product of a restructuring exercise about 18 months ago, reflecting the need to review and re-focus enterprise and commercialization and technology transfer. A central support office for research had existed since the early 1990 s and was first brought together with the technology transfer support services in 2004 / 5. Straightforward single purpose grants were handled by Faculty Research Support Officers, while more complex cases, such as multi-partner applications, came to REE for final checks and authorization. The Faculty structure was created about 5 years ago. Once grants were approved, Finance were involved – REE don’t handle the accounts except where contractual matters were involved. There was regular internal audit every few years of the process and the research policies [Supporting Docs 4 – 7] were kept under continuous review.

40|$|This Ph. D. thesis {{investigates the}} new {{financial}} recovery plans as instruments which aim {{to avoid the}} bankruptcy of local governments in difficulties. This tool {{was approved by the}} Italian Central Government by Law Decree No. 174 of 2012. The goal of this work is to verify whether a recovery plan is capable of ensuring fiscal discipline and financial sustainability. The literature on the subject focuses mainly on two aspects: the description of legal framework and the static analysis of recovery plans. The present research, instead, explores the drafting process of recovery plans by investigating the local governments’ decision-making process and the involvement of stakeholders in planning activity. Furthermore, this investigation takes a dynamic perspective since it aims to assess the recovery plans sustainability over time. To this end, a case-study focuses on Catania city and investigates the recovery plan adopted by the Council. Catania is the second populated city in Sicily and the largest which makes use of this remedy in the Region. To conduct this analysis, a Dynamic Performance Management approach is suggested. Such an approach allows decision-makers to frame the dynamic complexity by identifying strategic resources, performance drivers which affects inter-departmental (and inter-institutional) performance outcomes. Finally, the Dynamic Performance <b>Management</b> <b>chart,</b> along with qualitative information gathered in the fieldwork, is embedded into a System Dynamics model in order to simulate and test the dynamic performance of different policies. Simulations may support decision-makers to cope with dynamic complexity, to compare the performance over time, to adopt sustainable policies, and to trigger their mental learning process. Findings of the present study reveal the specific issues on the recovery plan ranging from decision-making to implementation phase. Particularly, centralization hitting the decision-making process, cost-cutting affecting the policies designing, and barriers concerning the implementation phase...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced, incurable cancer {{receiving}} anticancer treatment often experience multidimensional symptoms. We {{hypothesize that}} real-time monitoring of both symptoms and clinical syndromes will improve symptom management by oncologists and patient outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective multicenter cluster-randomized phase-III trial, patients with incurable, symptomatic, solid tumors, who received new outpatient chemotherapy with palliative intention, were eligible. Immediately before the weekly oncologists' visit, patients completed the palm-based E-MOSAIC assessment (Edmonton-Symptom-Assessment-Scale, ≤ 3 additional symptoms, estimated nutritional intake, body weight change, Karnofsky Performance Status, medications for pain, fatigue, nutrition). A cumulative, longitudinal monitoring sheet (LoMoS) was printed immediately. Eligible experienced oncologists {{were defined as}} one cluster each and randomized to receive the immediate print-out LoMoS (intervention) or not (control). Primary analysis limited to patients having uninterrupted (> 4 / 6 visits with same oncologist) patient-oncologist sequences was a mixed model for the difference in patients global quality of life (G-QoL; items 29 / 30 of EORTC-QlQ-c 30) between baseline (BL) and week 6. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis included all eligible patients. RESULTS: In 8 centers, 82 oncologists treated 264 patients (median 66 years; overall survival intervention 6. 3, control 5. 4 months) with various tumors. The between-arm difference in G-QoL of 102 uninterrupted patients (intervention: 55; control: 47) was 6. 8 (P = 0. 11) {{in favor of the}} intervention; in a sensitivity analysis (oncologists treating ≥ 2 patients; 50, 39), it was 9. 0 (P = 0. 07). ITT analysis revealed improvement in symptoms (difference last study visit-BL: intervention - 5. 4 versus control 2. 1, P = 0. 003) and favored the intervention for communication and coping. More patients with high symptom load received immediate symptom <b>management</b> (<b>chart</b> review, nurse-patient interview) by oncologists getting the LoMoS. CONCLUSION: Monitoring of patient symptoms, clinical syndromes and their management clearly reduced patients' symptoms, but not QoL.

The full text may be available through the publisher links provided above. This study explores the tensions inherent in place branding consulting, by problematising the prescriptive and functionalistic view of consultants that characterises the place branding literature. If consultants’ pervasive impact on the contemporary place branding practice cannot be ignored, their fixed representation as powerful agents of top-down policies might limit more holistic accounts of consultancy practice. Indeed, consultants can find themselves mediating between bottom-up and top-down approaches to place branding. Thus, they can decide to promote more inclusive activities that give voice to local communities, while simultaneously addressing the needs of urban elites that are likely to pay the consultancy bill. Liminality is suggested as an appropriate idea to challenge role fixity and appreciate the ambiguity of place branding consultancy. The study reports self-reflective accounts from a case study on Rio de Janeiro, where the first author was involved in a three-year activity of working with stakeholders to stimulate a more inclusive public debate on city-brand <b>management.</b> <b>Charting,</b> snowballing, coopting consultants, informal advising, feeding and scientific arming are the six types of consulting practices of stakeholder engagement that the study identifies in order to offering a more nuanced representation of place brand consulting.
