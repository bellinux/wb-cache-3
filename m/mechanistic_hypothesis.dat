The {{doctrine}} of teleology, in its extreme form, as we find it in Leibniz for example, implies that things and beings merely realise a programme previously arranged. But if there is nothing unforeseen, no invention or creation in the universe, time is useless again. As in the <b>mechanistic</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> here again it is supposed that all is given. Finalism thus understood is only inverted mechanism. It springs from the same postulate, with this sole difference, that in the movement of our finite intellects along successive things, whose successiveness is reduced to a mere appearance, it holds {{in front of us}} the light with which it claims to guide us, instead of putting it behind. It substitutes the attraction of the future for the impulsion of the past. But succession remains none the less a mere appearance, as indeed does movement itself. In the doctrine of Leibniz, time is reduced to a confused perception, relative to the human standpoint, a perception which would vanish, like a rising mist, for a mind seated at the centre of things.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to note that even while kinetic analysis is a powerful tool for determining the stoichiometry of the turn-over limiting transition state relative to the ground state, it cannot answer all mechanistic questions. It is possible for two mechanisms to be kinetically indistinguishable, especially under catalytic conditions. For any thorough mechanistic evaluation it is necessary to conduct kinetic analysis of both the catalytic process and its individual steps (when possible) in concert with other forms of analysis such as evaluation of linear free energy relationships, isotope effect studies, computational analysis, or any number of alternative approaches. Finally, it {{is important}} to note that no <b>mechanistic</b> <b>hypothesis</b> can ever be proven; alternative <b>mechanistic</b> <b>hypothesis</b> can only be disproven. It is, therefore, essential to conduct any investigation in a hypothesis-driven manner. Only by experimentally disproving reasonable alternatives can the support for a given hypothesis be strengthened.|$|E

Isotopic labeling of the nitrite with 15N has shown the mechanism non-‘caged’ and that the nitrosyl radical formed from a given nitrite recombines randomly with other alkyl radicals. However, recombination of the nitrosyl radical with the alkoxyl radical (a reversal of the homolytic cleavage) {{has been shown to}} proceed without scrambling of isotope labels. This lack of tight radical pairing is also supported by the observation that alkyl radicals generated by Barton conditions can undergo radical cyclization while analogous intermediates generated by lead tetraacetate oxidation do not.|$|E

5000|$|Human β-glucuronidase is {{homologous}} to the Escherichia coli enzyme β-galactosidase. This homologous relationship, {{along with}} the knowledge that glycosidases often perform hydrolysis catalyzed by two acidic residues, enabled the development of a <b>mechanistic</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> This hypothesis proposes that the two glutamic acid residues Glu540 and Glu451 are the nucleophilic and acidic residues, respectively, and that the tyrosine residue Tyr504 is also involved in catalysis. In support of this hypothesis, experimental mutations in any of these three residues result in large decreases of enzymatic activity. Increased activity of an E451A mutant enzyme (where Glu451 is replaced with an alanine residue) after addition of azide is consistent with Glu451 as the acid/base residue. [...] Using analysis of labeled β-glucuronidase peptides after hydrolysis of a substrate that enters a very stable intermediate stage, researchers have determined that Glu540 is the nucleophilic residue.|$|E

40|$|Senescence {{presents}} {{not only}} a medical problem, but also an evolutionary paradox because it should be opposed by natural selection. Evolutionary hypotheses propose that ageing evolves as the necessary cost of processes increasing early reproductive success(1, 2), or because of weaker selection against late-acting mutations(3). A prediction of these hypotheses is {{that the rate of}} ageing should increase and the average lifespan decrease as the rate of extrinsic mortality increases(1 - 7). Alternatively, non-adaptive, purely <b>mechanistic</b> <b>hypotheses</b> invoke damage to DNA, cells, tissues and organs as being the unique cause of senescence and ineluctable death of organisms(8). Here we show that the evolution of eusociality is associated with a 100 -fold increase in insect lifespan. Such an increase is predicted by evolutionary theories because termite, bee and ant queens live in colonies that are sheltered and heavily defended against predators. Moreover, a comparison of ants with contrasting life histories also reveals an association between lifespan and extrinsic rate of mortality. These results provide strong support for evolutionary theories of ageing, as purely <b>mechanistic</b> <b>hypotheses</b> of senescence do not propose any association between the rate of extrinsic mortality and lifespans...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The results {{presented}} in this paper confirm that the stereochemical outcome of the reversible additions of lithium (R) -methyl p-tolyl sulfoxide to N-arylidene-p-anisidines (N-PMP imines) depends on: (a) the reaction conditions used and (b) the electronic properties of the arylidene moiety on the starting imine. In particular, we show that under kinetic control (- 70 °C) the additions involving electron-rich N-arylidene groups occur with very high stereocontrol in favor of the (2 S,RS) -diastereomers, whereas an electron-deficient group favors the opposite stereochemical outcome.

40|$|A {{functional}} {{explanation for}} the regulation of grain nitrogen (N) accumulation in cereal by environmental and genetic factors remains elusive. Here, new <b>mechanistic</b> <b>hypotheses</b> of grain N accumulation are proposed and tested for wheat (Triticum aestivum). First, we tested experimentally the hypothesis that grain N accumulation is mostly source regulated. Four contrasting cultivars, {{in terms of their}} grain N concentrations and yield potentials, were grown with non-limiting N supply. Grain number per ear was reduced by removing the top part of the ear at anthesis. Reduction in grain number gave a significant increase in N content per grain for all cultivars, showing that grain N accumulation was source regulated. However, on a per ear basis, cultivars with a high grain number fully compensated their N accumulation for reduced grain number at anthesis. Cultivars with a lower grain number did not compensate completely, and grain N per ear was decreased by 16 %. Second, new <b>mechanistic</b> <b>hypotheses</b> of the origins of grain N source regulation and its response to environment were tested by simulation. The hypotheses were: (a) The regulation by N sources of grain N accumulation applies only for the storage proteins (i. e. gliadin and glutenin fractions); (b) accumulation of structural and metabolic proteins (i. e. albumin-globulin and amphiphilic fractions) is sink-regulated; and (c) N partitioning between gliadins and glutenins is constant during grain development and unmodified by growing conditions.
