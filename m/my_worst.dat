500|$|In May 2011, Gaga {{said her}} [...] "emotional connection" [...] {{with the song}} was difficult. When she was {{asked if it was}} because the song was {{originally}} written for Britney Spears, she answered: [...] "Well that’s not exactly what happened, but I don’t want to delve into that. I could delve into it if you turn that (motions to recorder) off... But ultimately the mix and the process of getting the production finished was very stressful for me. So when I say it’s <b>my</b> <b>worst</b> song {{it has nothing to do}} with the song, just my emotional connection to it." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1960, McGovern {{decided to}} run for the U.S.Senate and {{challenge}} the Republican incumbent Karl Mundt, a formidable figure in South Dakota politics whom McGovern loathed as an old-style McCarthyite. The race centered mostly around rural issues, but John F. Kennedy's Catholicism was a drawback {{at the top of the}} ticket in the mostly Protestant state. McGovern made careless charges during the campaign, and the press turned against him; he would say eleven years later, [...] "It was <b>my</b> <b>worst</b> campaign. I hated [...] so much I lost my sense of balance." [...] McGovern was defeated in the November 1960 election, gaining 145,217 votes to Mundt's 160,579, but the margin was one-third of Kennedy's loss to Vice President Richard M. Nixon in the state's presidential contest.|$|E

I had a moment with that song where I was like, 'Oh my God, every woman in this world needs to hear that'. No, we're not perfect. Sometimes, we think, 'What's wrong with us?'

The makeshift court heard evidence from eyewitnesses to the crime, and sent messengers to search Bellingham's lodgings.

500|$|During World War II, her {{brothers}} {{served in the}} armed forces, alleviating one of her monetary worries. Her husband, meanwhile, served in the Home Guard, besides continuing as a barrister. As he was new to his career, Rougier did not earn much money, and paper rationing during the war caused lower sales of Heyer's books. To meet their expenses Heyer sold the Commonwealth rights for These Old Shades, Devil's Cub, and Regency Buck to her publisher, Heinemann, for £750. A contact at the publishing house, her close friend A.S. Frere, later offered to return the rights to her {{for the same amount}} of money she was paid. Heyer refused to accept the deal, explaining that she had given her word to transfer the rights. Heyer also reviewed books for Heinemann, earning 2guineas for each review, and she allowed her novels to be serialized in Women's Journal prior to their publication as hardcover books. The appearance of a Heyer novel usually caused the magazine to sell out completely, but she complained that they [...] "always like <b>my</b> <b>worst</b> work".|$|E
500|$|Wilders {{is said to}} {{have been}} [...] "deprived... of a {{personal}} life for his... hatred of Islam". He is constantly accompanied by a permanent security detail of about six plainclothes police officers, and does not receive visitors unless they are cleared in advance, thoroughly searched, and escorted at all times. He lives in a state-provided safe house which is outfitted to be bulletproof, is heavily guarded by police, and has a panic room. He is driven from his home to his offices in parliament in an armored police vehicle, and wears a bulletproof vest. His office is located in the most isolated corner of the Dutch Parliament building, and was chosen because potential terrorists can get to it through only one corridor, making it easier for his bodyguards to repel an attack. He is married to Krisztina Wilders (née Marfai), a former diplomat of Hungarian origin, with whom he can only meet about once every week due to security concerns. The restrictions on his life because of this, he said, are [...] "a situation that I wouldn't wish on <b>my</b> <b>worst</b> enemy".|$|E

500|$|In 1982 the Cure {{recorded}} and released Pornography, {{the third and}} final album of an [...] "oppressively dispirited" [...] trio that cemented the Cure's stature as purveyors of the emerging gothic rock genre. Smith has said that during the recording of Pornography he was [...] "undergoing a lot of mental stress. But {{it had nothing to do}} with the group, it just had to do with what I was like, my age and things. I think I got to <b>my</b> <b>worst</b> round about Pornography. Looking back and getting other people's opinions of what went on, I was a pretty monstrous sort of person at that time". Gallup described the album by saying, [...] "Nihilism took over [...] We sang 'It doesn't matter if we all die' and that is exactly what we thought at the time." [...] Parry was concerned that the album did not have a hit song for radio play and instructed Smith and producer Phil Thornalley to polish the track [...] "The Hanging Garden" [...] for release as a single. Despite the concerns about the album's uncommercial sound, Pornography became the band's first UK Top 10 album, charting at number eight. The release of Pornography was followed by the Fourteen Explicit Moments tour, where the band finally dropped the anti-image angle and first adopted their signature look of big, towering hair and smeared lipstick on their faces. The tour also saw a series of incidents that prompted Simon Gallup to leave the Cure at the tour's conclusion. Gallup and Smith did not talk to each other for eighteen months following his departure.|$|E

2500|$|On day 2, Allan's 1984 diary was {{delivered}} to Carman's junior counsel and used against Allan in cross examination. The notebook contained details of Allan's sexual fantasies about a married Italian airline pilot named Ricardo and it cast doubt on her professed celibacy. Allan told the court that her relationship with Ricardo only included [...] "a degree of sexual foreplay". The judge said that any finding that Allan had lied {{about the extent of}} this relationship did not mean she had an affair with Terre'Blanche, whom she described as [...] "a very different man". The diary's disappearance was investigated by the police, but {{it was found that the}} diary had been left in the home of an English couple with whom Allan had resided in 1989. Allan revealed [...] "I was in a traumatic state and I wrote down <b>my</b> <b>worst</b> fears and probably <b>my</b> <b>worst</b> desires," [...] continuing [...] "It was a way of dealing with my sexual problems. [...] This notebook is deeply embarrassing. I wrote it when I was under psychiatric care."
