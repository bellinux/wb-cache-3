5|$|Overall, Great Northern Highway {{performs}} favourably {{in terms}} of road safety, compared to other major highways in Western Australia. Whilst making up {{two thirds of the}} state's National Highway network, it was the location of only half of all recorded fatalities for 2005–2009. For that period, the sections of the highway from Wubin to the Sandfire Roadhouse, north-east of Port Hedland, were considered by the Australian Automobile Association to be among the lowest risk highway links in the state. However, the section from Perth to Wubin was rated as medium risk, and the northern sections of the highway were rated <b>medium-high</b> and high risk. In 2013, Great Northern Highway received a similar rating, still higher overall than the other highways. Out of five stars, 21% was rated as one- or two-star, and 79% was rated three- or four-star, with the southern and northern ends of the highway generally less safe than the portion from Wubin to the Sandfire Roadhouse.|$|E

25|$|The Hawker Typhoon (Tiffy in RAF slang), is a British single-seat fighter-bomber, {{produced}} by Hawker Aircraft. It {{was intended to}} be a <b>medium–high</b> altitude interceptor, as a replacement for the Hawker Hurricane but several design problems were encountered and it never completely satisfied this requirement.|$|E
25|$|In {{supercritical}} water medium, the oxidation can {{be effectively}} catalyzed by MnBr2 with pure O2 in a <b>medium-high</b> temperature. Use of supercritical water instead of acetic acid as a solvent diminishes environmental impact {{and offers a}} cost advantage. However, the scope of such reaction systems {{is limited by the}} even harsher conditions than the industrial process (300−400°C, >200bar).|$|E
25|$|More {{than two-thirds}} of the country is plains, plateaus, or hilly land at an {{altitude}} less than 600m. Plains (below 200m) make up 31% of the land, plateaus and hills (200 to 600m) 41%, low mountains (600 to 1,000m) 10%, <b>medium-high</b> mountains (1,000 to 1,500m) 10%, and high mountains (over 1,500m) 3%. The average altitude of Bulgaria is 470m.|$|E
25|$|The Transitional geomorphological region {{encompasses}} the territory between the Balkan Mountains and the Rilo-Rhodope Massif and has complex, mosaic relief composed mainly of <b>medium-high</b> and low mountains, valleys and plains. The altitude decreases from west to east. This region includes the Sub-Balkan valleys; {{the mountains and}} valleys of the Kraishte region, such as Ruy Mountain, Miloslavska Planina and Milevska Planina; the mountains Lyulin, Vitosha, Sredna Gora, Strandzha and Sakar; the Dervent Heights; {{as well as the}} fertile Upper Thracian Plain. The highest point is Cherni Vrah in Vitosha at 2,290m.|$|E
25|$|Chianti Classico are premium Chianti wines {{that tend}} to be medium-bodied with firm tannins and <b>medium-high</b> to high acidity. Floral, cherry and light nutty notes are {{characteristic}} aromas with the wines expressing more notes on the mid-palate and finish than {{at the front of}} the mouth. As with Bordeaux, the different zones of Chianti Classico have unique characteristics that can be exemplified and perceived in some wines from those areas. According to Master of Wine Mary Ewing-Mulligan, Chianti Classico wines from the Castellina area tend to have a very delicate aroma and flavour, Castelnuovo Berardegna wines tend to be the most ripe and richest tasting, wines from Gaiole tend to have been characterised by their structure and firm tannins while wines from the Greve area tend to have very concentrated flavours.|$|E
25|$|Chianti Classico {{wines are}} characterised in their youth by their {{predominantly}} floral and cinnamon spicy bouquet. As the wine ages, aromas of tobacco and leather can emerge. Chiantis {{tend to have}} <b>medium-high</b> acidity and medium tannins. The acidity in the wines make them very flexible with food and wine pairings, particularly with Italian cuisines that feature red sauce, {{as well as with}} beef, lamb and game. Basic level Chianti is often characterised by its juicy fruit notes of cherry, plum and raspberry and can range from simple quaffing wines to those approaching the level of Chianti Classico. Wine expert Tom Stevenson notes that these basic everyday-drinking Chiantis are at their peak drinking qualities often between three and five years after vintage with premium examples having the potential to age for four to eight years. Well-made examples of Chianti Classico often have the potential to age and improve in the bottle for six to twenty years.|$|E
500|$|For {{most of its}} length, Darby Creek has a {{low level}} of water quality. However, in some reaches of the watershed, {{especially}} the upper reaches, the streams in the watershed have a medium-low or even <b>medium-high</b> level of water quality. A Superfund site known as the Lower Darby Creek Superfund Site contaminates Darby Creek and impacts the creek's water quality. The creek is considered to be impaired for its lower [...] The causes of the impairment are habitat modification, siltation, and flow variability stemming from urban runoff and storm sewers.|$|E
500|$|The UK's STFC (originally {{the major}} {{financial}} contributor) has gradually reduced its {{funding for the}} ING telescopes {{over a number of}} years. Some of this funding shortfall has been made up by other partners increasing their contributions, and some by efficiency savings and cutbacks. [...] As a result, the shares of observing time will become UK 33%, Netherlands 28%, Spain 34% and 5% for any nationality. A new development, started in 2010, is {{the development of a new}} wide-field multi-object spectroscopy facility (WEAVE), being developed by a UK-led consortium involving major contributions from the Netherlands, Spain, France, and [...] Italy, which is expected to be in place by the end of 2017. WEAVE will provide <b>medium-high</b> resolution spectroscopy in the visible (360-950 nm) range for up to 1000 simultaneous targets over a 2 degree field of view, and is currently expected to operate through to at least 2023.|$|E
500|$|Grodziskie is {{a highly}} carbonated, low-alcohol beer with a clear, pale yellow to golden color, low to {{moderate}} levels of hop bitterness, and a moderate to <b>medium-high</b> smoky aroma and flavor. [...] The bright, clear, and highly carbonated appearance of Grodziskie has caused the beer to be compared with Champagne, and it is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "Polish Champagne". Most beers that are made from wheat appear cloudy, because the final product contains suspended yeast and proteins from the wheat. [...] During the production of Grodziskie, however, the beer is filtered before it is bottled, usually by adding isinglass. [...] The filtration removes the suspended yeast and proteins, leaving a bright, clear beer. [...] When poured into a glass, it produces a large, long-lasting, tight head with small bubbles. [...] It was traditionally served in tall, conical glasses that were designed to show off the clear, golden color, as well allow a wide, thick layer of foam to form when it was poured.|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} P-39 {{retained a}} single-stage, single-speed supercharger with a critical altitude (above which performance declined) of about [...] As a result, the aircraft was simpler {{to produce and}} maintain. However, the deletion of the turbo destroyed any chance that the P-39 {{could serve as a}} <b>medium-high</b> altitude front-line fighter. When deficiencies were noticed in 1940 and 1941, the lack of a turbo made it nearly impossible to improve upon the Airacobra's performance. The removal of the turbocharger and its drag inducing inlet cured the drag problem but reduced performance overall. In later years, Kelsey expressed regret at not being present to override the decision to eliminate the turbo.|$|E
2500|$|In central {{parts of}} Serbia, the terrain {{consists}} chiefly of hills, low and <b>medium-high</b> mountains, interspersed with numerous rivers and creeks. The main communication and development line stretches southeast of Belgrade, towards Niš and Skopje (in Republic of Macedonia), along {{the valley of}} Great and South Morava river. Most major cities are located on or around that line, {{as well as the}} main railroad and highway. On the East of it, the terrain quickly rises to limestone ranges of Stara Planina and Serbian Carpathians, relatively sparsely populated. On the West, height of mountains slowly rises towards southwest, but they do not form real ridges. The highest mountains of that area are Zlatibor and Kopaonik.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008 European Road Assessment Programme {{reported}} {{the risk of}} being involved in a death or disabling injury accident as being between Low-medium and <b>Medium-high</b> depending on the section of road travelled. There were renewed calls in 2017 to improve the A59 in Ribble Valley, Lancashire, with MP Nigel Evans describing the A59 as a [...] "dangerous road" [...] whilst requesting the police carry out a full audit of accidents in an effort to tackle the problem. A proposal to improve safety of the road between Skipton and Harrogate, which is the only direct route between the towns, was discussed by councillors in March 2017. Numerous possible re-alignments are being considered in an effort to minimize or eradicate the impact of road closures, which has cost the council almost £1 million.|$|E
