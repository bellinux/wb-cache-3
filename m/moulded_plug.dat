40|$|The {{mains lead}} of this product is {{fitted with a}} non-rewireable (<b>moulded)</b> <b>plug</b> {{incorporating}} a 3 A fuse. Should the fuse need to be replaced, a BSI or ASTA approved BS 1362 fuse marked or and of the same rating as above, which is also indicated on the pin face of the plug must be used. Always refit the fuse cover after replacing the fuse. Never use the plug without the fuse cover fitted. In the unlikely event of the socket outlet in your home not being compatible with the plug supplied, cut-off the mains plug and fit an appropriate type. DANGER: The fuse from the cut-off plug should be removed and the cut-off plug destroyed immediately and disposed of in a safe manner. Under no circumstances should the cut-off plug be inserted elsewhere into a 13 A socket outlet as a serious electric shock may occur. To fit an appropriate plug to the mains lead, follow the instructions below: IMPORTANT: The wires in the mains lead are coloured {{in accordance with the}} following code...|$|E

40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{composite}} manufacturing process that would be able to deliver Class A surface finished products in the context of mould manufacturing methods. The problem required solving was to overcome the time needed to prepare Class A surfaces, by developing a composite manufacturing process that will deliver Class A surface finished products straight from the mould. The process was aimed at the entire development process, from <b>mould</b> and <b>plug</b> design up to the finished product. A literature study and a factory mould survey were conducted with a view to obtain the necessary insights into surface finishing and composite manufacturing. These surveys were followed by seven constructional tests which determined the most appropriate solutions for the proposed manufacturing processes. Test 1 was used to determine a quality finish standard for composites from the sanding grits used to finished composite surfaces versus surface roughness values used in other industries. The standard determined that a P 800 finish has a roughness between 0. 200 and 0. 150 um and constitutes a Class A 3 finish. P 1000 to P 1200 have a roughness between 0. 150 um to 0. 100 um and constitutes a Class A 2 finish. Finally a P 2000 and higher have a roughness of 0. 100 um and lower and constitutes Class A 1 surface finish. After the standard was set, the tests for finishing of the <b>moulds,</b> <b>plugs</b> and parts commenced. Test 2 was conducted on the CNC manufacturing of plugs out of Nuceron 651 tooling board. Tool path parameters were varied in a matrix. The samples with the best surface finish value were cut with a step-over of 0. 5 and feed of 800 mm/min. These parameters were found to be the most influential. Test 2 and 4 revealed that the plug surface finishing should commence with conventional 2 K paint finishing, with a possibility of acrylic split surface. This process produced projected mould surfaces between 0. 150 um and 0. 200 um, which can be categorised as Class A- 3. Test 5 and 6 determined methods for improving the mould surface quality and durability. It was established that the tooling gelcoat should be applied whilst being heated and backed with at least two layers of glass veil and a steady increase of GSM of structural glass fibres to prevent print-through. Test 3 determined that the mould corners could be strengthened with rovings pressed into the corner. It was also established that the moulds surfaces will require finishing after demoulding. The final moulds were manufactured from a fibreglass composite structure with tooling gelcoat surface. A number of guidelines and a set process were developed in order to produce moulds with a surface finish of average 0. 9 um, equivalent to Class A 1. Release agents were tested in Test 7, and the Loctite Frekote 770 -NC release system was deemed appropriate for use with In Mould Coating (IMC) of 2 K Paint. These elements were all synthesised into <b>plug,</b> <b>mould</b> and part manufacturing processes. The proposed processes were validated by the manufacturing of a JS instrument panel, which delivered a Class A 2, 0. 175 um, finish with IMC of 2 K paint. With only a minor sanding of P 3000 grit and polishing, the part was made into a Class A 1 surface, measured at 0. 63 um. The study proved that it is possible to produce Class A finished part with IMC. This method can provide a solution aimed at the elimination of P 600 and lower finishing of composite parts manufactured with IMC. Master...|$|R
50|$|France, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland use the CEE 7/6 {{plug and}} CEE 7/5 socket {{with the same}} size and spacing of the main pins but with a male protective-earth pin on the socket instead of the earth clips, and without the guiding notches at the sides. Most modern <b>moulded</b> Schuko <b>plugs,</b> and good-quality rewirable replacements, are a hybrid version ("CEE 7/7") with an {{aperture}} that accommodates the earth pin of CEE 7/5 sockets. CEE 7/6 plugs that need to be polarised are configured {{in such a way as}} to only be inserted correctly in earthed sockets, however the old CEE 7/1 2-pin unearthed socket is inherently dangerous with equipment that should be polarised, for example table lamps with an Edison screw lamp but only a single pole inline cord switch in lieu of a double pole switch. The safety of polarisation was not helped by several years of confusion when the correct connection of sockets was transposed.|$|R

This paper discusses the possible applications of Additive Manufacturing (AM) techniques {{for the production of}} Carbon Fibre (CF) components without the aid of <b>mould</b> or <b>plug</b> used by traditional methods. This paper investigates the available AM designing techniques to experimentally prove the validity of the research to develop a design concept that can be embedded into an AM machine as a 3 D Printer. Polylactic acid (PLA) tensile test specimens are produced with CF reinforcement using both traditional moulding and AM techniques. The preliminary mechanical testing of moulded specimens with fibres revealed a tensile strength increase of up to 73 % when compared to specimens without fibres and the testing of PLA filaments produced by AM with fibres showed a performance increase of 66 % when compared to filaments without fibres...|$|R
5000|$|Three-piece (or [...] "open-throat") {{boots were}} first {{developed}} by Mel Dalebout (around 1969), who introduced a rigid magnesium boot shell {{in that year}} (Brixia {{did the same thing}} with their aluminum shell at around the same time). The big advantage was that the main shell was a single piece that was convex at all points, meaning it could be easily produced using a <b>plug</b> <b>mould.</b> Conventional boots with overlapping flaps required more complex moulding processes. Engineers at Henke, Heierling, Sanmarco and Caber saw the advantage for high-speed moulding, and plastic three-piece boots were on the market by 1972, when Roland Collombin won the Olympic downhill in the Henke Strato.|$|R

5000|$|In 2006 the Wayfarer Class, perhaps {{mindful of}} Morrison's earlier {{contribution}} to their class development with Wellington, commissioned him to redesign and update the Wayfarer {{for the current}} generation http://www.wayfarer.org.uk/index.php?id=28&cmd=news. In July 2007 Cliff Norbury is quoted by the Wayfarer Class Association as recommending {{the adoption of the}} updated Morrison Wayfarer design as follows:“Richard Hartley, the new Copyright Holder of the Wayfarer dinghy, has commissioned Phil Morrison to update the design of the boat to incorporate new manufacturing techniques and modernise the internal layout, and be competitive with existing GRP and wood boats racing in the Class. A prototype of this new design has been produced, and Mr Hartley requested advice on whether the performance objective has been achieved, so that the new model could be satisfactorily incorporated into the Class. To satisfy this request a measurement exercise to determine the external shape of the boat was carried out on 16 May 2007 by Ken Kershaw, Technical Manager of the RYA , using the Bryan Jig developed by the RYA. Present were Richard and Mark Hartley, Phil Morrison, Ian Porter and myself. The method and equipment was the same as that used in January 2004 to measure a sample of wood and GRP Wayfarer hulls in order to report on the validity of the two wood hulls re-built by Duffin. We also had available an accurate hull measurement of Mike McNamara’s boat “Cordon Rouge” carried out by Ian Proctor in 1991. We were thus able to compare the hull shape of the prototype with existing hulls that between them cover the full range of variation accepted by the class as being within the rules and normal manufacturing tolerances. Having witnessed this measurement exercise and analysed the results, it is my considered opinion and advice that this new hull will have a good performance in relation to all existing boats. It could be bought with confidence by new owners but need not be feared by existing owners. The measurement process of course showed some variation in hull shape between the boats, some {{as a result of the}} normal variation that occurs over the years in the shape of GRP <b>plugs,</b> <b>moulds</b> and hulls, and in the case of wooden hulls the wide building tolerances accepted by the class rules. The measurements of the new hull fell generally within the range of the other boats. In those areas which could possibly affect performance, the new hull seemed to be a sensible but not extreme shape."The impact on the Class: The emergence of a competitive, attractive, modern and well priced boat is bound to be a great move forward for the Class. It is in line with Ian Proctor’s objective over the years in introducing new marks of the Wayfarer. The new boat will give the class the opportunity to adopt the principles of a Manufacture Controlled One Design Class, in line with all the modern new classes that have been so successful, starting with the Laser and now including such classes as the 49er and the RS series of boats. These classes have very few hull measurement rules and ensure close one-design control by ensuring that all boats are built from moulds that emanate from a single master plug, with a tight manufacturing spec. The Class would be advised to update its rules, generally following the example of the 49er, which I played a role in writing. All existing boats currently racing in the class could be grandfathered."Finally may I say that this is a very exciting development. I wish the Class and the new copyright holder every success for the future.Cliff Norbury.” ...|$|R
