5000|$|The Australians {{proved to}} be tough bargainers. As was the case during earlier rounds of negotiations, there was little {{incentive}} for them to conclude a reciprocal trade agreement. Australian officials also resented Mackenzie King's reluctance to seek a broad imperial solution to the postwar slump in trade. In their view any agreement with Canada would merely assist American subsidiaries operating in the dominion {{at the expense of}} companies from Britain. For over two years, the discussions dragged on before Canadian negotiators were forced to give in to Australian demands in order to preserve the market for British Columbia's forestry products. In exchange for receiving important concessions on canned salmon, auto parts and paper, Canada reduced its duties on Australian meat and butter and increased the <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> enjoyed by Australian dried fruit. The 1925 agreement was soon the source of some controversy. It was strenuously opposed by Canadian farmers, who feared new competition from imported Australian meat and butter. Canada's conciliatory prime minister fretted about the accord which caused this noisy debate and condemned the minister responsible. Mackenzie King's liberal philosophy was offended by the prospect of raising Canadian tariffs on imports from third countries in order to give Australia an increased <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> for dried fruit. Moreover, these provisions were aimed primarily at the United States just as trade between the two North American countries had begun to recover. The prime minister gave the accord only lukewarm support, and no sooner had the agreement been approved than he delighted in crippling one of its main provisions. An Australian program to promote the export of butter was found guilty on a technicality of violating Canada's anti-dumping legislation in early 1926. King rejected the Australian prime minister's repeated pleas for understanding and insisted on imposing punitive duties. When, later in the decade, a slump in international trade began to pinch at Canadian exports to the United States, F.L. McDougall, a close advisor to the Australian prime minister, gleefully waited for depression [...] "to drive Mackenzie King into a much more helpful attitude towards Empire economic cooperation."15 In anticipation, perhaps, Australia appointed its first trade commissioner to Canada, R.A. Haynes, in 1929.|$|E

It argues that countries pursuing preferential trade initiatives are {{in pursuit of}} the economic rents resulting from the trade diversion associated with trade preference (or discrimination). By lowering the <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>preference,</b> multilateral trade liberalization reduces those rents and is likely to be resisted by members of trade-diverting preferential blocs.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of {{the operation of the}} US GSP scheme since it was introduced in 1976 reveals that although {{it has the potential to}} stimulate imports from developing countries, the structural deficiencies of the scheme have prevented it from making more than a nominal overall impact. The study identifies these shortcomings as limited product coverage, the competitive need limitations, discretionary decision making on specific aspects, requirement of reciprocity and the existence of several unilateral preferential schemes at the same time. However, it also makes the assessment that in the current environment of aggressive pursuit by the administration of reciprocal concessions from developing country trading partners, any suggestion for elimination of these inadequacies is likely to prove fruitless. The reduction in MFN tariffs after successive rounds of multilateral trade negotiations has eroded the <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> and diminished the value of the GSP concessions. The simple average of MFN tariffs on non-agricultural products has come down to 3. 2 per cent after the Uruguay Round. If there is eventual accord in the Doha Round, the range of MFN tariffs of 6 to 10 per cent will stand lowered to between 3. 4 and 4. 4 per cent. As a consequence, preferences under the GSP would largely pass into an era of near irrelevance. Despite the gloomy outlook at present, it would be worthwhile to persevere with it rather than make futile attempts to convince the USA of the need to make far-reaching improvements in its unilateral preferences...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} future of the world trading system in the face of {{diminishing}} returns from current multilateral trade negotiations and the proliferation of bilateral and regional trade agreements (RTAs). It traces the evolution of the postwar trading regime from {{the early decades of the}} General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that were dominated by the United States and the European Communities to the new World Trade Organization (WTO) in which developing countries have begun to play a more important role, especially in the current Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations (MTNs). The paper discusses the substantive and tactical reasons why the Doha Round has progressed so grudgingly and is unlikely to achieve its ambitious objectives. It then examines why developing countries increasingly have turned to RTAs to complement WTO talks, whether these pacts benefit or hinder MTNs, and how RTAs affect the influence of developing countries in the WTO. The final section of the paper looks at the WTO going forward and posits that, after the Doha Round, the trading system in the 21 st century requires substantial reform. The problems of the Doha Round and the proliferation of regionalism confront WTO members with three central challenges: First, multilateralize multilateralism. There are a vast number of exceptions that take the WTO far away from the ideal of a universal system with a single set of rules. The paper suggests that officials focus on the broad exceptions to most-favored nation (MFN) and national treatment in Articles XX and XXI, especially the provisions covering border security and environmental issues. Second, multilateralize regionalism. The challenge is to make the design and implementation of RTAs more WTO-friendly. The paper calls for greater transparency of RTAs through more frequent and rigorous WTO reporting requirements, and new disciplines on discriminatory rules of origin. The paper offers two correctives: cut MFN tariffs and thus reduce the <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> for RTA members; or, alternatively, require that RTA members harmonize and lower the MFN tariffs down to the level of the lowest rate applied by any of the RTA members. Third, modernize multilateralism. The WTO agenda needs to be refocused on the problems of international commerce in the 21 st century. WTO rules on taxes and subsidies need to be recast to cover concerns about currency manipulation, regulatory abuse or neglect, and labor market practices as well as to meet the new challenges of climate change initiatives. In addition, WTO members will have to address trade and security linkages before pre-shipment inspection and visa requirements become major obstacles to international flows of goods, services, and people. To do so, the WTO will have to collaborate more effectively with other international economic organizations. " [author's abstract...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{attempts}} {{to assess the}} benefits of Duty-Free and Quota-Free Market (DFQF) access initiatives of the Republic of Korea for least developed countries (LDCs), which {{have been in place}} since 1 January 2008. Following a brief introduction on the background of this initiative, this paper examines the exports profile of LDCs, reviews the DFQF scheme of the Republic of Korea, and assesses the potential benefits of the DFQF scheme for LDCs as well as Bangladesh. The export profile of LDCs shows that the share of those countries in world exports in recent years has increased; this can be attributed to price increases for petroleum constituting a major share of LDC total exports. The Republic of Korea is the tenth largest destination of LDC exports, which indicates that the DFQF initiatives of the Republic of Korea for LDCs will {{have a positive impact on}} LDC exports. The DFQF scheme of the Republic of Korea covers 6, 967 tariff lines, representing about 59 per cent of the all tariff lines of its Customs Schedule. There are at least 25 chapters where product coverage within the chapter is very low, notably below 10 per cent. These include garments, made-up textiles, and major agricultural products including fisheries. Among the DFQF lines, 1, 464 lines are duty-free on a most-favoured nation (MFN) basis. Hence, LDCs enjoy tariff preferences on 5, 503 tariff lines, while the average <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> on these lines is 7. 89 per cent. The margin of preferences in most cases is either 6 per cent or 8 per cent. In order to enjoy the preference granted under the scheme, the products should be wholly obtained, or should have at least 50 per cent value addition. Analysis also reveals that the DFQF scheme covers 36. 1 per cent of LDCs’ export to the Republic of Korea in 2007, keeping 64. 9 per cent of current LDC exports to that country outside the purview of preferential treatment. Only three major export items from LDCs – copper cathodes, raw tobacco and plywood – enjoy -free access. Bangladesh, Congo, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malawi, Myanmar, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia are likely to benefit from duty-free access for these items. The Republic of Korea is the seventh-largest destination for Bangladesh exports. Bangladesh enjoys preferential access to the Republic of Korea under the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA). DFQF access for LDCs adds 5, 471 tariff lines for Bangladesh under preferential access. However, analysis shows that the additional lines cover only 4. 63 per cent of Bangladesh’s exports to the Republic of Korea in 2007. However, there are important apparel articles in the scheme that may yield benefits for Bangladesh. APTA continues to remain attractive to Bangladesh because of higher trade coverage and more relaxed rules of origin. Nevertheless, the DFQF scheme currently offered by the Republic of Korea is a milestone for the developing countries’ initiative for LDCs, and one that is likely to lead to other countries coming up with similar initiatives. In time, the Republic of Korea is likely to incrementally increase the product coverage, which will lead to higher trade coverage and more favourable rules of origin, and will yield significant benefits for LDCs. least developed countries, Bangladesh, Korea, market access,...|$|E
40|$|Striking {{a balance}} between trade {{facilitation}} and preventing trade deflection {{is the single most}} difficult challenge with regard to the issue of rules of origin (ROO). ASEAN ROO is already considered as among the simplest in the world and still, in practice, results fall short of expectations. Haddad (2007) made the following observations about the ASEAN ROO : (1) low AFTA preference utilization rate, (2) difficult compliance even for supposedly simple value-added rule, (3) administrative cost of compliance to prove origin acting as deterrent, (4) low <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> for goods traded within ASEAN, and (5) the bulk of intra-ASEAN trade occurring in commodities where preference margins are below the threshold that would justify the cost of compliance. Lessons from the EU experience indicate {{that there are a number}} of factors which could further lessen the negative effects of restrictive rules of origin schemes. This is related to the wide spectrum of ROO among the various East Asian FTAs. According to Manchin and Pelkmans-Balaoing (2007), the burden of production costs induced by restrictive rules of origin can be somewhat reduced by allowing less restrictive cumulation rules (e. g. diagonal or full cumulation), allowing duty drawback, outsourcing and higher de minimis levels. Furthermore, administrative costs can also be reduced by more trader-friendly approaches, such as self-certification methods. The reforms in ASEAN ROOs are indeed heading toward the direction of less restriction and simplification as described by Manchin and Pelkmans-Balaoing (2007) : The relatively ample allowance for imports in the AFTA stems from the realization that for many heavily-traded products in the region, like electronics, production processes may be so splintered that the value of local content is often a small percentage of the products total value. Very early on in the formation of AFTA, it was recognized that the 40 percent ASEAN origin rule may often not be met in the case of trade in textile and textile products. In 1995, it was therefore decided that either the percentage value-added or the substantial transformation rule may be used by ASEAN exporters. The AFTA ROO underwent further overhaul, starting in 2003, when operational procedures were further clarified and simplified. In the same year, the decision was reached to adopt a change in tariff heading rule for determining the origin of the product as a general alternative rule applicable to all products which cannot comply with the 40 percent local/ASEAN content requirement, giving priority to sectors which are the subject of private sector requests and those sectors prioritized by the AEM for accelerated integration. As of last year (2006), the change of tariff heading rule is fully endorsed for four sectors : wheat-flour, wood-based products, aluminum products and iron and steel. Forging ASEAN in an effective regional economic bloc and eventually an economic community, however, would entail more fundamental structural reforms. The argument by the 2003 McKinsey report that market fragmentation lies at the heart of ASEANs competitiveness challenge is rather simplistic. Fortunately, the six projects currently being undertaken by the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) address these fundamental issues. These studies deal primarily with supply side constraints focusing on enhancing the capability of ASEAN member countries to engage with each other and other countries more effectively and meaningfully. In the medium term, ASEAN member countries can push for an East Asia Free Trade Area that will consolidate the various bilateral and sub-regional FTAs and therefore overcome the noodle bowl syndrome. This would be a direct result of harmonizing the various ROO. It goes without saying that the ultimate or long-term objective would be an equitable and efficient multilateral trading system anchored on lower MFN rates under the auspices of the WTO.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{recent research}} by the authors {{on the effects of}} free trade areas (FTAs). Within our model, which emphasizes inter-continental transport costs, several conclusions arise. (1) FTAs are likely to be detrimental over a moderate range of parameter values, even if drawn along natural regional lines. (2) A small <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>preferences</b> for neighbors is beneficial. (3) Optimal preferences depend on the parameters, particularly on transport costs. (4) If preferences are raised further, they enter the zone of negative returns to regionalization, and eventually the super-natural zone, where welfare is lower than under the MFN status quo. Estimates from the gravity model suggest the world system may already be in the super-natural zone. The core model leaves out many factors. But we have pursued a variety of extensions by now. Perhaps the two most important are generalizing the highly stylized model of trade (to include factor endowments), and relaxing the assumption that the inter-bloc level of tariffs remains fixed. In the latter case, allowing tariffs to be endogenous yields a much more optimistic outlook for the effects of FTAs. ...|$|R

40|$|WTO trade {{negotiations}} on market access follow the MFN treatment. However, an increasing {{share of trade}} falls under preferential regimes. For agriculture, trade liberalization analyses have showed that the impact on developing countries (DC) is not uniform, partly from omitting preferences. In this paper, we examine whether preference-recipient DC benefit more from across the board tariff cuts than from preferences. We employ a global CGE model with detailed preference-inclusive tariff database to examine the differential impact of trade liberalization on DC subject to preferences versus MFN-based market access. We focus on the European Union- the world largest preferences provider- and run two experiments of tariff cuts by the EU: a 50 % across-the-board MFN tariff cut on agricultural products with or without comparable preferential tariff cuts. Results show that EU preferences confer a market access advantage for beneficiary countries, especially the Least Developed and ACP countries, which is eroded under MFN tariff cuts. A combination of across-the-board MFN and preferential tariff cuts (to preserve <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>preference)</b> enable some but not all preferential partners to preserve or increase its trade with the EU. Moreover, the composition of trade changes and the magnitude of trade loss will vary between partners and products and depends on {{the specifics of the}} preferential regime.

It {{takes into account the}} preferential {{rules of origin}} that were notified to the WTO; whenever known and available, modifications to the original rules of origin have been updated. This study contains two basic features: a description of some key elements of preferential rules of origin in RTAs, followed by an attempt to provide a reality-check of how these rules affect actual trade. That is done by an ex-post examination of data on the use <b>of</b> RTAs' <b>preferences</b> and, in their absence, <b>of</b> their <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> (MOPs). While the raison d' of preferential rules of origin is the avoidance of trade deflection, the practice in RTAs has diluted this objective and it would seem that preferential rules of origin are increasingly becoming an economic, political and trade instrument. In its descriptive part, the study identifies {{what seems to be a}} tendency to design stricter rules of origin, while detecting concomitantly the inclusion in modern preferential rules of origin of flexibilities that provide, through the rules of origin themselves, a preference beyond the lower tariff rate resulting from the preferential treatment and mechanisms that allow the integration of third-parties into preferential rules of origin regimes. The reality-check part of the study points to the fact that much beyond the coverage of RTAs, it is their effective implementation that poses a challenge to economic operators. Though data on the use <b>of</b> <b>preferences</b> is either not disclosed or inexistent, they are nevertheless available for some economies. On the basis of existing data <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> utilization, the analysis of the effects of rules of origin on preferential trade flows appears to give rise to a dual reality - namely a relatively high use <b>of</b> <b>preferences</b> in certain instances coexisting with preferences failing to attain their potential in other cases. As regards RTAs for which utilization rate is not available, the paper analysis preferential rules of origin from a MOPS perspective, assuming that MOPs of at least 5 percentage points would offset compliance costs and thus provide a stimulus to comply with rules of origin in order to benefit from preferences. The analysis, made for 68 out of 192 RTAs, do not allow any conclusion regarding that generally presented hypothesis. Finally, the paper briefly outlines some suggestions for further action, including the launching in the WTO of exploratory work on preferential rules of origin within an open regionalism scenario...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{comprehensive}} World Bank - UNCTAD data base on tariff barriers NTBs), the authors examine {{the incidence of}} Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) trade barriers to exports of the former Soviet Union (FSU). OECD markets have grown steadily in importance {{in the past decade}} and now receive more than half of FSU exports. And additional trade could help the FSU republics make the transition to market economies. Overall OECD tariffs that the FSU republics face are 70 to 90 percent higher than the average paid on all goods imported, but their worst effect is the result <b>of</b> the <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> they give other (non-FSU) exporters. For example, because of a special EFTA-EC protocol, manufactures are traded duty-free between countries in these blocs, while similar (competing) FSU goods may face duties of 20 percent or more. No significant trade expansion will occur until nontariff barriers are liberalized in NTB-"ridden"products groups of interest to FSU exporters. Sectors in which NTBs are particularly important include fish, fruit, sugar, vegetables, beverages, textiles, clothing, and ferrous metals. OECD trade barriers on some FSU commodity exports provide high levels of"effective protection"that constrain the efforts of the newly independent states of the FSU (NISs) to increase domestic commodity processing. Although the United States has granted most-favored nation status to the NISs (excluding Azerbaijan), and the European Community recently signed the Agreements on Trade, Commercial, and Economic Cooperation with the Baltic states, these developments have not substantially improved their market access. Because of geographic proximity and the existing transportation network, the European market is the most important OECD market for most NISs. But under present EC arrangements, NIS products are subject to higher tariffs and more restrictive nontariff barriers than exports from EFTA members, Lome Convention signatories, or former European CMEA members (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia). Lower wage rates in many NISs may not be sufficient to compensate for their generally lower productivity and the losses in value added (triggered by higher tariffs) that exportershave to absorb to compete in protected markets. Except for exports of energy and industrial raw materials trade opportunities for many products in which the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union might have a comparative advantage are greatly restricted by OECD tariffs and nontariff barriers.

40|$|Two {{southern}} African MPs {{have launched}} a booklet entitled 'Beyond the Rhetoric of Economic Partnership Agreements'. This {{has been published}} {{to coincide with the}} debate in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly on the Cape Town Declaration. The booklet critiques the European Commission's current approach to the forthcoming ACP-EU negotiations. It highlights how, in southern Africa, ACP-EU trade preferences have stimulated a considerable expansion in exports <b>of</b> products where <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> are significant, slowing down the trade marginalisation of the region arising from declining prices of traditional exports. It questions whether economic partnership agreements (EPAs), as currently conceived, will provide effective support to the structural transformation of ACP economies. The authors call on the EU to ensure that no ACP country is left worse off in terms of access to the EU market as a result of any new trading arrangements. Indeed they want the EU to improve access for ACP exports to the EU market and suggest establishing closer consultations on how to ensure EU food safety without creating new obstacles to ACP exports. The authors question whether, in the light of past practices and experience, current EU arrangements for the management of aid are capable of addressing the many supply side constraints that inhibit internationally competitive production in ACP countries. They ask for a complete review as a prelude to the establishment of comprehensive programmes of assistance. The booklet notes that moves towards free trade with the EU {{will have an impact on}} government revenues in some ACP countries. The authors claim that the EU has a responsibility for assisting ACP countries given that its current proposals for economic partnership agreements will intensify the challenges faced. Future negotiations should therefore any reference to the effect of the EU's common agricultural policy on ACP economies.

40|$|The {{board of}} {{directors}} of the Sugar Association of the Caribbean meeting on May 15 - 16 th 2003 noted 'the uncertainties surrounding the future of the European Union's sugar policy after 2006 and that long-term stability in respect of this policy is vital for the implementation of the ACP-EU Sugar Protocol and the SPS Agreement'. Areas of uncertainty include: the outcome of the WTO challenge to the EU 'C' export system; reform of the EU sugar regime; the impact of EU enlargement; the impact of the full implementation of the EBA sugar arrangement; the outcome of the EPA negotiations. These uncertainties are affecting long-term planning and restructuring plans. The directors committed themselves to seeking the 'maintenance of the current level <b>of</b> tariff <b>preferences</b> for African Caribbean and Pacific countries' and a 'fairly managed sugar market in the EU'. Comment: With Commissioner Fischler indicating that, for sectors not yet subject to reform, new proposals would 'follow the general lines of the present proposals', some decline in the EU sugar price appears inevitable. With tariffs being based on the difference between the EU and world market price, this is likely to result in reduced tariffs on sugar imports and hence in erosion <b>of</b> the tariff <b>preferences</b> that ACP exports currently enjoy. For ACP suppliers this issue is more about the value <b>of</b> the <b>preferences</b> per se (how much money you will get per tonne of sugar exported under a reformed sugar regime) rather than the <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> tariff <b>preference.</b> While during the transitional period the EU is likely to opt for a managed sugar regime, Commissioner Fischler has indicated that ultimately the Commission would like to see sugar included in the de-coupled single farm payment system. This implies the ultimate abandonment of a managed sugar regime, possibly as early as 2009. The {{board of directors}} of the Sugar Association of the Caribbean meeting on May [...] ...|$|R

Using a tobit and probit estimation we find that the impact <b>of</b> unilateral trade <b>preferences</b> on both margins is strictly linked to the sector under analysis and to the type <b>of</b> <b>preferences</b> a country benefits from. In particular, we find an anti-diversification effect along with a concentration of exports in agricultural products in the case of more stable preferential schemes, as represented by the African Caribbean and Pacific trade preferences. We also confirm that the Generalized System <b>of</b> <b>Preferences</b> (GSP) for least developing countries did not change the beneficiaries' export pattern, while the traditional GSP and the regime to combat drug production tend to promote diversification <b>of</b> exports.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{exploration}} of a particular cultural preference, "body modification" (i. e. the 'atypical' practices of tattoo, piercing, scarification, suspension and related practices), in the United Kingdom and United States. In the short span of about thirty years these practices have crept from the margins toward the mainstream and have lost a degree of their deviant status in the process. In spite of the geographic differences between body modifiers, meanings and motivations are remarkably similar across a number of themes. Yet the root of these similarities and growth in practice stems mainly from the actions of body modifiers themselves rather than swooping external, global market forces that would appropriate body modifiers' culture. Using Bourdieu's concept of the "field" as an orienting tool to explore culture, this thesis draws upon life history interviews with people who conduct body modifications, historical record, law and legal debates, questionnaire data, an abbreviated ethnography and letters between founding members of the field. It looks at how body modification emerges, grows, and maintains continuity of cultural content and changes through interactions between internal and external institutions, producers and consumers. The intertwined processes of legitimation, identification and professionalization {{play a crucial role}} in structurating the field to allow for growth and popularity. As a set of cultural practices that emerged from the <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> cultural <b>preferences,</b> the body modification field was shaped and continues to be shaped by the hostile environment from which it emerged, even though public reception to body modification is no longer quite as antagonistic as it once was. Emerging at a time when body modification was truly deviant from the norm, early body modifiers created strong frameworks of meaning and underlying values that were aimed at normalizing practices to a wider public, being inclusive to gain members and also embraced a wide variety of body modification practices. When the field began to grow and some body modifiers had formally organized, elite members forcefully attempted to draw practice away from the more 'extreme' end of body modification. This resulted in opposing efforts to reassert core field values, but as the numbers of both consumers and producers continued to grow the field was riddled with competition and boundary struggles. Gaining a modicum of legitimacy within the wider scope <b>of</b> cultural <b>preferences</b> and gaining new members caused tension over status hierarchies and the growth of more 'extreme' practices.
