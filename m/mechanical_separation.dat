25|$|To measure cosmogenic {{isotopes}} produced within solid earth materials, such as rock, {{samples are}} generally first put {{through a process}} of <b>mechanical</b> <b>separation.</b> The sample is crushed and desirable material, such as a particular mineral (quartz in the case of Be-10), is separated from non-desirable material by using a density separation in a heavy liquid medium such as lithium sodium tungstate (LST). The sample is then dissolved, a common isotope carrier added (Be-9 carrier in the case of Be-10), and the aqueous solution is purified down to an oxide or other pure solid.|$|E

The size of condensed carbon dioxide (CO 2) enriched droplets after expansion cooling determines the design of these centrifugal separation units. We report the first measurements of condensed CO 2 enriched droplets using an optical reflectance method. CO 2 droplets in a methane enriched atmosphere down to 2 µm are detected. The optical reflectance method directly yields a chord length distribution rather than the actual diameters. A complete scheme to interpret the diameters from these raw signal (chord length distribution) measurements is presented.

2500|$|Most {{municipalities}} {{that operate}} incineration facilities have higher recycling rates than neighboring {{cities and counties}} that do not send their waste to incinerators.. In a country overview from 2016 [...] by the European Environmental Agency the top recycling performing countries are also the ones having the highest penetration of incineration, even though all material recovery from waste sent to incineration (e.g. metals and construction aggregate) is per definition not counted as recycling in European targets. [...] The recovery of glass, stone and ceramic materials reused in construction, as well as ferrous {{and in some cases}} non-ferrous metals recovered from combustion residue thus adds further to the actual recycled amounts. Metals recovered from ash would typically be difficult or impossible to recycle through conventional means, as the removal of attached combustible material through incineration provides an alternative to labor- or energy-intensive <b>mechanical</b> <b>separation</b> methods.|$|E

50|$|Generally, {{there are}} two ways to {{separate}} the waste material into different classes which includes <b>mechanical</b> <b>separation</b> and manual separation. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>separation</b> aims to prepare the waste stream for manual separation which could separate metals, plastics, glasses and some other components easily and fast by many different types of sorting method and machines. The manual separation divides into positive sorting and negative sorting, positive sorting aims to collect the recyclable material from waste stream and negative sorting aims to remove the hazardous and unusable waste out of waste stream. Positive sorting requires a higher quality but low collection rate; on the other hand, negative sorting allows a high collection rate but low quality. It is possible increase the effectiveness with a good controlling of manual separation. A good separation of waste contributes to further treatment of the waste stream and increases the efficiency of the waste treatment system.|$|E
