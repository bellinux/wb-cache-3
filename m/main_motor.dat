25|$|Evaluation of the {{submarine}} {{was based on}} attaining a series of licenses, gradually testing the capabilities of Collins and those operating her from surface sailing to deep, unaccompanied dives. The <b>main</b> <b>motor</b> was started {{for the first time}} on 8 August 1994, as part of a series of 'basin trials'. Collins officially commenced sea trials at when she departed the ASC wharf at 10:00 on 31 October 1994. By the time {{the submarine}} had exited Port Adelaide, two of the three diesel generators had broken down.

25|$|Unlike Western designs, the R-21 used a cold launch {{solid rocket}} to eject the missile from the flooded launch tube before the <b>main</b> <b>motor</b> ignited. This allowed {{missiles}} {{to be launched}} in a water depth of 40-60m. The propulsion system used an IRFNA-amine fuel, AK-27I/TG-02. AK-27I {{was a mixture of}} 73% nitric acid, 27% nitrogen tetroxide, and an iodine passivant. The fuel was originally used in the Wasserfall rocket under the name TONKA-250 and consisted of 50% triethylamine and 50% xylidine. This gave the R-21 a range of , double that of first-generation sub-launched missiles. The Naval Institute Guide suggests that the range was initially 1300km, and extended to 1650km later {{in the life of the}} missile. There was a single warhead of approximately 800 kilotons.|$|E

500|$|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a {{long-term}} degenerative disorder of {{the central nervous system}} that mainly affects the motor system. The symptoms generally come on slowly over time. Early in the disease, the most obvious are shaking, rigidity, slowness of movement, and difficulty with walking. Thinking and behavioral problems may also occur. Dementia becomes common in the advanced stages of the disease. Depression and anxiety are also common occurring in {{more than a third of}} people with PD.

2500|$|Before {{the advent}} of solid state electronics, {{camshaft}} controllers were used to control the speed of electric motors. [...] A camshaft, driven by an electric motor or a pneumatic motor, was used to operate contactors in sequence.

2500|$|The {{submarine}} {{was removed}} from the water at the end of 1994 to allow ASC to further complete the fitting out of the boat and perform repairs to the hull. Although sea trials resumed in early 1995, Collins did not dive again until 9 June, when it was decided that the status of the combat system drop was sufficient to allow further underwater tests of the submarine. The tests went without difficulty until the next day, when the anchor cable snapped in poor weather, forcing Collins to return to port. When approaching the ASC wharf, a programming problem with the propulsion switchboard caused the <b>main</b> <b>motor</b> to cut out. Collins drifted into the wharf, hitting the construction facility's shiplift at [...] The backup motor then belatedly engaged, causing the submarine to collide with , the ship assigned to assist in the submarine's sea trials.
