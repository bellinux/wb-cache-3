6000|$|... is a {{familiar}} verse from Cymbeline; any {{one can see the}} resemblance to the pale blue of that admired and loved blossom in the blue veins of any person with a delicate skin. Purples and purplish reds in masses are mostly seen in young persons of delicate skins and high colour in frosty weather in winter, when the eyes sparkle and the face glows with the happy sensations natural to the young and healthy during and after outdoor exercise. The skin purples and purple-reds here described are beautiful, and may be matched to a nicety in many flowers; the human purple may be seen (to name a very common wild flower) in purple loosestrife and the large <b>marsh</b> <b>mallow,</b> and in dozens and scores of other familiar purple flowers; and the purple-red hue in many richly coloured skins has its exact shade in common hounds' tongue, and in other dark and purple-red flowers. But we always find, I fancy, that the expression due to human association in a purple flower is greatest when this colour (as in the human face) is placed side by side or fades into some shade of red or pink. I think we may see this even in a small flower like the fumitory, in which one portion is deep purple {{and all the rest of}} the blossoms a delicate pink. Even when the red is very intense, as in the common field poppy, the pleasing expression of purple on red is very evident.|$|E

50|$|Most of the mallows {{have been}} used as food, and are {{mentioned}} by early classic writers with this connection. Mallow was an edible vegetable among the Romans; a dish of <b>marsh</b> <b>mallow</b> was one of their delicacies. Prospero Alpini stated in 1592 that a plant of the mallow kind was eaten by the Egyptians. Many of the poorer inhabitants of Syria subsisted for weeks on herbs, of which <b>marsh</b> <b>mallow</b> {{is one of the most}} common. When boiled first and fried with onions and butter, the roots are said to form a palatable dish, and in times of scarcity consequent upon the failure of the crops, this plant, which grows there in great abundance, is collected heavily as a foodstuff.|$|E

50|$|Upon arriving, {{the three}} {{land in a}} <b>Mallow</b> <b>Marsh.</b> The Rabbit recounts that he himself did not see Cyrus, rather {{he was told that}} the Dormouse told him that he saw Cyrus at the Mad Hatter's house, which has been {{abandoned}} for some time. Alice and the Knave find themselves stuck in quicksand (made of marshmallow), and the Rabbit runs ahead to go find help. Alice and the Knave manage to escape, while ahead of them, the Rabbit is ambushed by the Red Queen. He is taken back to her palace, where it turns out that he was forced by her to bring Alice back to Wonderland. The Red Queen tells the Rabbit that he will be her eyes and ears in all of this, lest he be killed. The Rabbit complies and sadly walks away, when the Agrabahian sorcerer Jafar (Naveen Andrews) begins to talk to her. Jafar was the one who wanted Alice back in Wonderland. He tells the Queen she is no longer needed, but she convinces him not to kill her when she reminds him that she {{is the only one who}} knows of Alice's whereabouts. Back at the marsh, the Knave tells Alice that he never wished to return to Wonderland, and he would rather not continue on this journey. She takes off her heel, where it turns out she keeps three glowing gems that are actually wishes that Cyrus gave her long ago. She offers one to the Knave if he helps her see this adventure through. When asked why she doesn't use them to wish Cyrus back, Alice tells the Knave that wishes are far too unpredictable, and that wishing Cyrus back could likely teleport him to them as a hung corpse. The two begin to search for the Hatter's house, and Alice climbs a tree to get a better view of the forest, leaving her shoes with the Knave. At the top, she spies the Hatter's house. She is attacked by the Cheshire Cat (Keith David), who has become much more violent since she was last in Wonderland. She manages to get to ground level, noticing the Knave and her shoes are gone. Before she is killed, the Knave returns, throwing a piece of size-altering mushroom into the Cheshire Cat's mouth. It shrinks to kitten size, and scurries off. The Knave returns Alice's wishes, Alice assuring him that wishes will not work unless they are granted, not stolen. The two then make it to the Hatter's house, where they find only an empty home filled with hundreds of hats. The Rabbit appears again, telling them he searched all over for them. The Knave tells Alice it's likely all this was untrue, and Cyrus is still dead. Alice runs from the house, crying until she finds an amulet belonging to Cyrus on the ground. She takes this as proof that he is still alive and tells the two she will not stop on her quest to find her true love. Meanwhile, Cyrus is held captive by Jafar within a castle somewhere in Wonderland. Alice, the Knave and the White Rabbit continue their search, walking through a field in the distance.|$|R

50|$|Extraction using {{superheated}} water {{tends to}} be fast because diffusion rates increase with temperature.

For example, in extraction of essential oils from rosemaryand coriander,the more valuable oxygenated terpenes were extracted much faster than the hydrocarbons. Therefore, extraction with superheated water can be both selective and rapid, and has been used to fractionate diesel and woodsmoke particulates.Superheated water is being used commercially to extract starch material from <b>marsh</b> <b>mallow</b> root for skincare applicationsand to remove low levels of metals from a high-temperature resistant polymer.|$|E
50|$|Seashore mallow (Kosteletzkya virginica), {{also known}} as sweat weed, Virginia {{saltmarsh}} mallow, and salt <b>marsh</b> <b>mallow,</b> is an herb found in marshes along the eastern seashore of the United States. This flowering plant is in family Malvaceae of the order Malvales. Researcher John Gallagher describes the pink-flowered seashore mallow as both a perennial and a halophyte, or salt-tolerant plant, that grows in areas where other crops can't. The plant can grow to above 1 metre in height, the leaves are 6-14 cm long, cordate to lanceolate with toothed margins. The stems and leaves are hairy. Flowers are 5-8 cm across, with 5 petals surrounding a tube consisting of the fused stamens and style. It blooms from July to October with pale to deep pink flowers.|$|E
5000|$|Fewflower Milkweed is a {{perennial}} plant {{that can be}} frequently found in marshes (fresh and brackish), low glades, and wet pine barrens. It prefers sandy and loamy soils that are well-drained, but can also survive in poorly drained swampy soils. Optimum soil pH is between 5 and 7, however it can grow within a range of 4.5 to 7.5. While it can grow in semi-shaded areas, it prefers a sunny site. A. lanceolata is adapted to a precipitation zone that ranges from 500 to 1500 mm annually, and a temperature that ranges from 8 to 35 degrees Celsius. Optimum precipitation range is 600 to 1400 mm per year, and optimum temperate ranges from 12 to 30 degrees Celsius. This milkweed can withstand winter temperatures down to -25 degrees Celsius. [...] In the wild, it is often found growing near Salt <b>Marsh</b> <b>Mallow,</b> Kosteletzkya virginica. This plant is susceptible to damage by slugs, especially when it is young and vulnerable.|$|E
5000|$|Inspired by the {{painters}} from Siena and Florence during the Italian Renaissance, Price {{is best known}} for her floral still life paintings which used gold and silver leaf. [...] Her works were created by first applying red clay and gesso to wooden panels. Metal leaf was added and then oils painted on the panels of figures or flowers. She created large gilded panels with this technique. [...] "Her work combines a Sienese delicacy of line with a modern freedom in the use of color," [...] wrote a New York Times critic. Examples of such work, including Mallows (1929) and Delphinium Pattern (ca. 1933), were included in The Painterly Voice: Bucks County's Fertile Ground, a 2011 exhibition of the James A. Michener Art Museum. She also painted landscapes, genre scenes, and ships, including a unique series of Spanish treasure ships.

40|$|Background: Owning to {{therapeutic}} properties, flixweed and <b>marsh</b> <b>mallow</b> {{have traditionally}} been very important in Iran. In this research study the effect of various concentrations of ethanol flixweed seed and <b>marsh</b> <b>mallow</b> root extracts, collected from different areas of Iran, was studied on Streptococcus pyogenes; {{the effect of the}} extract with antibiotics of penicillin, erythromycin and amoxicillin was compared in a completely randomized design with four replications. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, discs impregnated with concentrations of 25, 50, 100, 250 mg/mL were prepared from ethanol extract of flixweed concentration in Jiroft, Baghin, Rafsanjan and Kohbanan as well as <b>marsh</b> <b>mallow</b> root extract in Tehran, Isfahan, Yazd and Kerman. Then, they were placed on culture medium of blood agar that S. pyogenes has grown on. Finally, inhibitory effect was evaluated. Results: The results showed that, among different areas and available antibiotics, the highest inhibition zone was related to <b>marsh</b> <b>mallow</b> root extract of Yazd in concentration of 250 mg/mL with 14. 5 mm. Beta hemolysis was observed on concentrations of 50, 100 and 250 mg/mL of flixweed seed extracts in all areas; thus, these concentrations are not suitable for producing herbal medicine. Concentration of 25 mg/mL, however, showed no hemolysis in all areas. The best extract to produce herbal medicines with flixweed seed was related to concentrations of 25 mg/mL.
