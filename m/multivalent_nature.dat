The ease of synthesis, the unique physico-chemical properties (with respect to surface plasmonic feature), biocompatibility, and surface functionalization feature have made AuNPs widely applicable in sensor/biosensor design [6]. Due to their inherent <b>multivalent</b> surface <b>nature,</b> therapeutic and diagnostic applications of functionalized AuNPs have been extensively explored [7, 8].

In this study, we have examined the interaction between a prefoldin and a chaperonin from hyperthermophilic archaea by immunoprecipitation, single molecule observation, and surface plasmon resonance. We demonstrate that Pyrococcus prefoldin interacts most tightly with its cognate chaperonin, and vice versa, suggesting species specificity in the interaction.

40|$|CD 44 {{is a major}} cell surface {{receptor}} for {{the large}} polydisperse glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA). Binding of the long and flexible HA chains {{is thought to be}} stabilized by the <b>multivalent</b> <b>nature</b> of the sugar molecule. In addition, high and low molecular weight forms of HA provoke distinct proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects upon binding to CD 44 and can deliver either proliferative or antiproliferative signals in appropriate cell types. Despite the importance of such interactions, however, neither the stoichiometry of multivalent HA binding at the cell surface nor the molecular basis for functional distinction between different HA size categories is understood. Here we report on the design of a supported lipid bilayer system that permits quantitative analysis of multivalent binding through presentation of CD 44 in a stable, natively oriented manner and at controlled density. Using this system in combination with biophysical techniques, we show that the amount of HA binding to bilayers that are densely coated with CD 44 increases as a function of HA size, with half-maximal saturation at ∼ 30 kDa. Moreover, reversible binding was confined to the smaller HA species (molecular weight of ≤ 10 kDa), whereas the interaction was essentially irreversible with larger polymers. The amount of bound HA decreased with decreasing receptor surface density, but the stability of binding was not affected. From a physico-chemical perspective, the binding properties of HA share many similarities with the typical behavior of a flexible polymer as it adsorbs onto a homogeneously attractive surface. These findings provide new insight into the <b>multivalent</b> <b>nature</b> of CD 44 -HA interactions and suggest a molecular basis for the distinct biological properties of different size fractions of hyaluronan...|$|E

The judicious choice of hydrogel precursors allows one to introduce the necessary attributes to these materials that dictate their performance towards intended applications.

According to Durfor and Becker’s (1964) classification of TH, only one groundwater sample (W 7) was moderately hard among the 14 sampling locations. The remaining groundwater samples were very hard (greater than 180  mg/L as CaCO 3) in <b>nature.</b> <b>Multivalent</b> cations, particularly magnesium and calcium, are often present at a significant concentration in natural water.

The calcium concentration in groundwater samples were beyond acceptable limit in two locations (W 1 and W 9). In most of the locations, magnesium content plays a major role and ranges between 7.2 and 81.6  mg/L. The TA was higher than the acceptable limit of 200  mg/L as CaCO 3 in all sampling locations. The high alkalinity imparts an unpleasant taste and may be deleterious to human health along with the high pH, TDS, and TH. Enhanced rock water interaction during post-monsoon could also contribute (to a limited extent) toward the increased values in bicarbonate (Pawar 1993).|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S., Chemistry (Biochemistry)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. This Thesis {{examines}} {{the synthesis of}} polar, tertiary amine dendrimers terminated with glucosamine. These glycodendrimers, once sulfated, could inhibit the binding of the HIV envelope glycoprotein, gp 120, to host cells. Studies have shown that gp 120 specifically binds {{to a variety of}} receptors, allowing HIV to infect a multitude of cell types. Upon further investigation, researchers have determined that gp 120 uses sugar moieties on sphingolipids and sulfated polyanionic proteins as host cell receptors. Studies of analogs to these known gp 120 receptors have shown that sulfated polyanionic sugars bind with a stronger affinity to gp 120 than the host cell receptors themselves. Research has also shown that the infection process for HIV is <b>multivalent</b> in <b>nature,</b> which means multiple copies of gp 120 bind to multiple copies of receptors simultaneously in order to gain access into the host cell. However, to mimic this process, multiple receptor analogs need to be clustered together on a scaffold. 	Dendrimers are hyper-branched, three dimensional, globular macromolecules. They are comprised of three parts: 1) a core, 2) repeating units attached in a radial manner to the core, and 3) terminal functional groups attached to the outer surface. These macromolecules are synthesized either from the core out to the terminal groups, known as divergent synthesis, or from the terminal groups inward toward the core, known as convergent synthesis. Due to the variability in synthesis, dendrimers can be any size and have any physical properties desired. Therefore, in this application, dendrimers allow gp 120 receptor analogs to be positioned {{in a manner similar to}} what is found naturally on the surface of host cells. This work will show the successful synthesis of two core molecules [TEAm-(G 1) 3, TEAm-G 1 -(DAP) 3], a glucosamine-terminated linker (G-AE-PA), as well as two glucosamine-terminated dendrimers [TEAm-G 1 -(GlcN) 3, TEAm-G 1 -(G-AE-PA) 3].

40|$|M. F. A. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2013. Includes bibliographical references. This {{paper will}} explore the symbolic, cultural, and {{technical}} aspects of my thesis exhibition Still Flow, which was exhibited at the University of Hawaii-Manoa's (UH-Manoa) Commons Gallery from March 8 - 15, 2013. This thesis exhibition and paper are the culmination of six years of creative inquiry into how to utilize the earth's volcanic process and product as an artistic means of expression. This process and research was formed and adjusted {{over the years in}} response to the technical and cultural complications that arose around it. This paper will therefore also delve into the relevant topics that altered and directed the outcome of this thesis project in order to understand why an artwork dealing with the abovementioned subject matter is of any consequence and is worth the creator's making and the critics' contemplation. The artwork Still Flow is a multimedia installation that utilizes a video projection, sculpture, and commercially processed materials. It functions as an allegory for human effort and the complexity of nature (human, cultural, social, economic, ecologic, and geologic) that arises and has arisen through time. The major symbols used in this allegory-a boat made of cooled lava, commoditized (culturally revered) land, machines (helicopters), molten lava rivers, and a voyage-create an art-space that exists as a forum in which inquisitive viewers will consider how these symbols relate to their own efforts to exist in nature. The combination of the aforementioned symbols function as a corollary to the complexities of human existence and the eruptive volcanic continuum that shapes this earth: both rise from the earth, journey within and around this sphere, and return to it when that energy has been expended. Because of the remote location (the lava fields of the Big Island of Hawaii) and the material utilized (Hawaiian cinder), it is also a dialog about the native Hawaiian population and the non-natives who have moved to the islands. This interface between the Polynesian diaspora that originally settled on the islands of Hawaii, who self-identify as Hawaiians, and those who are not of the same genetic origin, has created conflicts of interest regarding topics of colonization, property rights, identity, exploitation, and ethical practices. The objective of this exhibition is <b>multivalent</b> in <b>nature.</b> It was not meant to solve the previously mentioned problems, but instead intended to bring them into a social forum so that those who wished to engage in these topics had an outlet to express their opinions. It was also intended to present those uninformed about this subject matter a setting in which they might question the intention of the artwork and begin a path towards seeking the information that could help them to understand some of the complexities of living on the Hawaiian Islands. Lastly, this was an artwork that responded to and was formed by my interaction with the people native to Hawaii, as well as the non-natives. This thesis exhibition began as a way to explore my fascination with the geothermal process that has formed and is still forming this sphere on which we walk. While searching for ways to create an artwork from the volcanism of Hawaii, my fascination was quickly encircled by the more contentious and perplexing cultural and economic perspectives that contribute to the underpinnings of this artwork's allegory. It is best to begin with a formal description of the thesis exhibition's video, sculpture, and commercial components to understand how this artwork functions on all of these levels...|$|R

In addition, aberrant {{interaction of}} the microtubule-associated protein Tau with filamentous actin is connected to synaptic impairment in Alzheimer’s disease.

We show that Tau uses several short helical segments to bind in a dynamic, multivalent process to the hydrophobic pocket between subdomains 1 and 3 of actin. Although a single Tau helix is sufficient to bind to filamentous actin, at least two, flexibly linked helices are required for actin bundling. In agreement with a structural model of Tau repeat sequences in complex with actin filaments, phosphorylation at serine 262 attenuates binding of Tau to filamentous actin. Taken together the data demonstrate that bundling of filamentous actin and cross-linking of the cellular cytoskeleton depend on the metamorphic and <b>multivalent</b> <b>nature</b> of microtubule-associated proteins...|$|E

The hybrid inorganic–organic catalytic systems combine the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis (higher activity and catalyst recycling, respectively). The high fidelity process of SAM formation on gold nanoparticles, together {{with the possibility of}} making mixed SAMs composed of different thiols, provides an unprecedented route to stable, complex catalytic systems. Insertion of catalysts in a mixed monolayer can improve the catalytic performances, due to catalyst orientation, changes in the local chemical environment, or through the steering effect of neighbouring thiols. Alternatively, insertion of catalytic units in a monolayer may be an essential prerequisite in the case when catalysis requires cooperation between two catalytic units (for instance two metal ions). Finally, the <b>multivalent</b> <b>nature</b> of these systems is an important feature especially in the case when the substrate contains multiple reactive sites.

Using the particle-swarm optimization method in combination with first-principles density functional theory calculations, here wepredict a new category of 2 D monolayers named tellurene, composed of the metalloid element Te, with stable 1 T-MoS 2 -like (α-Te), and metastable tetragonal (e̱ṯa̱-Te) and 2 H-MoS 2 -like (γ-Te) structures.

40|$|A review. The use of bio-specific {{interactions}} for the sepn. {{and recovery}} of biomols. is now widely established {{and in many}} cases the technique has successfully crossed the divide between bench and process scale operation. Although the major specificity advantage of affinity-based sepns. also applies to systems intended for cell fractionation, developments in this area have been slower. Many of the problems encountered result from attempts to take techniques developed for mol. systems and, with only minor modification to the conditions used, apply them for the sepn. of cells. This approach tends to ignore or at least trivialise the problems, which arise from the heterogeneous nature of a cell suspension and the <b>multivalent</b> <b>nature</b> of the cell/surface interaction. To develop viable sepn. processes on a larger scale, effective contacting strategies are required in separators that also allow detachment or recovery protocols that overcome the enhanced binding strength generated by multivalent interactions.

40|$|Ciliary {{neurotrophic}} factor (CNTF) drives the sequential assembly of a receptor complex containing the ligand-specific a-receptor subunit (CNTFR) and the signal-transducing b-subunits gp 130 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor-b (LIFR). CNTFR can function in either membrane-bound or soluble forms. The membrane- bound form mediates the neuronal actions of CNTF, whereas the soluble form serves to confer cytokine responsiveness to non-neuronal cells expressing gp 130 and LIFR. The {{objective of this}} work was to analyze whether the two receptor isoforms differ {{in their ability to}} interact functionally with CNTF and related proteins. Two new types of CNTF variants, characterized by weakened interactions with either CNTFR or both LIFR and gp 130, were developed, and the biological activities of these and other mutants were determined in non-neuronal versus neuronal cells, as well as in nonneuronal cells transfected with an expression vector for CNTFR. Membrane anchoring of CNTFR was found to render the CNTF receptor complex relatively insensitive to changes in agonist affinity for either a- or b-receptor subunits and to promote a more efficient interaction with a gp 130 -depleting antagonistic variant of CNTF. As a result of this phenomenon, which can be rationalized in terms of the <b>multivalent</b> <b>nature</b> of CNTF receptor interaction, CNTF variants display striking changes in receptor selectivity...|$|E

While oriental imports discovered on Crete {{have been the subject}} of several recent publications, there are currently no studies that deal with orientalising finds from the island in a similarly comprehensive manner. The aim of the present work is to fill this gap in scholarship and to provide a solid basis for interpretation. Following a multifaceted approach, the thesis offers an in-depth investigation of relevant pottery, terracottas, sculpture and metal finds. These classes of objects are investigated in terms of types, contexts and iconographies; they are then compared to potential Near Eastern models, which are examined in equal detail where appropriate. Based on this evidence, presumed connections to the Near East are challenged or substantiated while novel links are added, offering fresh insights into the meaning of the Cretan material. A critical revaluation of Cretan contacts with the Near East puts gained findings into a larger perspective of socio-political relations. The final part of the thesis suggests a new interpretation of the material, stressing the importance of Cretan agency, cultural self-definition and the <b>multivalent</b> <b>nature</b> of the orientalising phenomenon on the island. </p...|$|E
40|$|Characterization of {{the binding}} of a tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) ligand to its receptor(s) is pivotal {{to understand how}} these proteins initiate signal transduction pathways. Unfortunately, kinetic elucidation of these interactions is strongly hampered by the <b>multivalent</b> <b>nature</b> of the binding partners. The interaction between TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and its death receptors was analyzed using in-depth applications of surface plasmon resonance technology. Variations in receptor density and sensor chip type allowed us to manipulate the stoichiometry of the formed complex, and the rate constants describing the binding of trimeric TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand to only one receptor molecule were determined. Remarkably, the affinity of this trimer-monomer complex is in the picomolar range, and its dissociation very slow. Further analysis showed that {{the second and third}} receptor molecules bind with lower affinity to the preformed trimer-monomer complex. This together with results obtained with receptor activator of NF-kappa B ligand and B cell-activating factor strongly suggests that the binding of TNF family ligands to their receptors is initiated via the formation of a trimer-monomer complex that is sufficiently stable to allow binding of two additional receptor molecules. These results suggest that avidity does not play a significant role and thus provide new insight in how TNF ligands form the biologically important complexes with their receptors.

40|$|Abstract—We {{have used}} {{fluorescence}} anisotropy to measure in situ the thermodynamics of binding of alanine-rich mutants of the GCN 4 basic region/leucine zipper (bZIP) to short DNA duplexes, in which thymines were replaced with uracils, {{in order to}} quan-tify {{the contributions of the}} C 5 methyl group on thymines with alanine methyl side chains. We simplified the a-helical GCN 4 bZIP by alanine substitution: 4 A, 11 A, and 18 A contain four, 11, and 18 alanine mutations in their DNA-binding basic regions, respec-tively. Titration of fluorescein-labeled duplexes with increasing amounts of protein yielded dissociation constants in the low-to-mid nanomolar range for all bZIP mutants in complex with the AP- 1 target site (50 -TGACTCA- 30); binding to the nonspecific control duplex was> 1000 -fold weaker. Small changes of < 1 kcal/mol in binding free energies were observed for wild-type bZIP and 4 A mutant to uracil-containing AP- 1, whereas 11 A and 18 A bound almost equally well to native AP- 1 and uracil-containing AP- 1. These modest changes in binding affinities may reflect the <b>multivalent</b> <b>nature</b> of protein–DNA interactions, as our highly mutated proteins still exhibit native-like behavior. These protein mutations may compensate for changes in enthalpic and entropic con-tributions toward DNA-binding in order to maintain binding free energies {{similar to that of the}} native protein–DNA complex...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to their}} unique {{properties}} transition metal porphyrins {{are widely used}} in many technological applications such as sensors, solar cells, nonlinear optics and nanomaterials [1]. During the last decade the coordination properties and conformational flexibility of porphyrins were heavily exploited in a search of prospective isomers able to deliver better functionality in specific technological applications [1]. One such important class of porphyrins is the nitrogen-confused porphyrins (NCPs), which are novel and prospective materials with improved properties for use as acid catalysts and anion/cation sensors [2]. These porphyrin isomers differ greatly from the parent porphyrins, particularly in their chemical structure and their physical and coordination properties. The <b>multivalent</b> <b>nature</b> of NCPs as a metal ligand provides a potential strategy for stabilising and studying higher or atypical oxidation states of metals, e. g. Ni(I), Ni(III), Cu(III), Ag(III), or unusual coordination geometries [2]. In addition, the outer nitrogen or carbon atoms of the inverted pyrrole ring can be directly connected resulting in oligomeric porphyrin arrays with interesting applications. Using NCPs in such molecular arrays provides new modes of linking single molecules and different coordination properties of the resulting oligomers [2]. In order to realize their full potential a detailed knowledge of the electronic structure and chemical bonding in porphyrins is required. Such information can be obtained with x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) ...|$|E
40|$|The rich {{story and}} {{discourse}} of Hebrew Bible stories, their built-in gaps and ambiguities, their <b>multivalent</b> <b>nature,</b> and their examples of fallible {{people in the}} face of God’s grace, make them excellent resources for religious education. It is troubling, therefore, to find that many Christian children’s bible storybooks (or “children’s bibles”) available in the United States since the late nineteenth century retell these stories in ways that eliminate these very features, often reducing the stories to simplified morality tales with bible heroes serving as upstanding role models. In doing so, these children’s bibles both reveal and reinforce the church’s assumptions about the purpose of the religious education of children {{and the nature of the}} Bible and its role in religious instruction. Over the past one hundred and twenty five years, children’s bible storybooks have been among the most popular and influential types of Christian publications in the United States. They are some of the most widely purchased Christian education resources for children and often serve as a child’s first impression of influential bible stories. This paper is based on a survey of hundreds of children’s bible storybooks available in the United States from the late 1800 ’s to the present. It will examine retellings of the story of Noah from Genesis and the ending of the book of Jonah in particular in order to illustrate some of the ways that many children’s bible storybooks stifle the religious education potential of the original stories...|$|E
40|$|The tumour-derived {{monoclonal}} IgM antibody PAT-SM 6 specifically kills malignant cells by an apoptotic mechanism {{linked to}} the excessive uptake of plasma lipids. The mechanism is postulated to occur via the multi-point attachment of PAT-SM 6 to the unfolded protein response regulator GRP 78, located {{on the surface of}} tumour cells, coupled to the simultaneous binding of plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL). We prepared and characterised LDL and oxidized LDL using sedimentation velocity and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) techniques indicated apparent dissociation constants of approximately 20 nM for the binding of LDL or oxidized LDL to PAT-SM 6. ELISA experiments showed cross competition with LDL inhibiting PAT-SM 6 binding to immobilised GRP 78, while, in the reverse experiment, GRP 78 inhibited PAT-SM 6 binding to immobilized LDL. In contrast to the results of the ELISA experiments, sedimentation velocity experiments indicated relatively weak interactions between LDL and PAT-SM 6, suggesting immunoabsorbance to the microtiter plate is driven by an avidity-based binding mechanism. The importance of avidity and the multipoint attachment of antigens to PAT-SM 6 was further investigated using antigen-coated polystyrene beads. Absorption of GRP 78 or LDL to polystyrene microspheres led to an increase in the inhibition of PAT-SM 6 binding to microtiter plates coated with GRP 78 or LDL, respectively. These results support the hypothesis that the biological action of PAT-SM 6 in tumour cell apoptosis depends on the <b>multivalent</b> <b>nature</b> of PAT-SM 6 and the ability to interact simultaneousl...|$|E
