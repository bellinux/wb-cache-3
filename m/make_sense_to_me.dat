The show {{included}} nine new pieces, with an exclusive signing on opening night. The show served as part {{one of the}} two-part [...] "Glorious Excess" [...] series, with the second installment [...] "Glorious Excess (DIES)" [...] due at JANM on August 22, 2009. Shinoda commented on the inspiration behind the Glorious Excess series, stating, [...] "It Got {{to a point where}} the pervasiveness of 'celebrity news' concerned me. It seemed like it has jumped out of its niche into places where it doesn't belong. I would be watching the news, and thinking, 'of all the things {{going on in the world}} right now, why are they covering so-and-so's breakup?' It didn't <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Add to that the fact that I'm supposed to somehow 'belong' to that celebrity group—and I really don't feel like I do in a lot of ways—and you can see how the topic started to become really interesting to me. The Glorious Excess (BORN) show was my way of diving into those topics, trying to find answers. It follows a central 'celebrity' character, who is filthy rich, slightly violent, and famous without any particular skill or talent." ...|$|E

2500|$|Scheduled for {{a release}} date of November 1998, the premiere issue was rescheduled for March 1999, to {{coincide}} with the creation of a trade paperback, , to help promote the new series. Collecting several of the character's printed appearances, Batman: Anarky was released in February 1999. However, the release date for the second volume was then pushed back again to May. An unintended result of this constant rescheduling was the effect it had on Grant's efforts to plot early story lines for the series. Due to increasing time constraints for the approaching millennium, it prevented Grant from exploring potential plots involving the Y2K bug he discussed with Breyfogle. Grant also reported that the series was dogged by editorial restrictions, including demands that he include cameos for particular characters, or [...] "tone down" [...] the degree of philosophy of the series. One of the earliest of these editorial mandates was that Grant was ordered to completely rewrite the first three-issue story line, and remove Anarky from Gotham City in the first issue. This was achieved by explaining that following an [...] Lonnie's parents disappear, their house is destroyed, and he is threatened by Batman to leave the city. [...] As one of many refugees who escapes from No Man's Land, he relocates to a new base of operations beneath the Washington Monument. Extremely displeased with the forced approach in creating this justification, Grant later said, [...] "Reading over that I was not so happy with the way I’d written that because it didn’t <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> at the time and it doesn’t make sense now." [...] These constant impositions on the part of editors nearly drove Grant to quit the series, but he continued the project for Breyfogle's benefit. [...] "I was all for walking away, but artist Norm had a mortgage and family, and basically needed the work." ...|$|E

5000|$|As a {{non-profit}} incubator, 1871 takes {{money from the}} state to bring in capital for these tech startups. A few people such as CEO of Level Office, Bill Bennet, believe [...] "we shouldn't use the state money that way". He continues to argue with [...] "it doesn't <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> why we should use taxpayer funds to subsidize one place”. One of the main arguments against the funding {{is that there are}} other non-state funded avenues for statups to find affordable working spaces, like WeWork. Tullman, CEO of 1871, argues the space provides resources other coworking spaces could not, like mentoring, workshops and events for the entrepreneurial community.|$|E

I was still turning around in my head how this could be. And then they mentioned Paul McCabe. That did not make sense at all to me.

It was a full 11 months afterwards that I got the book of evidence.|$|E
5000|$|.....during the (No Man's Land) story line, when Gotham {{was devastated}} by an earthquake, for reasons which I {{could not make}} {{rational}} or logical in the story, Batman sought out Anarky {{and told him he}} had to leave the city or Batman would come down on him like two ton of concrete. It didn’t make sense. You’d think if Gotham was in pieces then Batman would want all the help he could get. But he threw Anarky out of the city and just disappeared for months...Reading over that I was not so happy with the way I’d written that because it didn’t <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> at the time and it doesn’t make sense now.

5000|$|I view {{music as}} a {{continuum}} and there're different faces that it takes. This is not a genre record. I don't do genre. I've always listened to that music, it's the main thing I'm listening to now. You know, they're the guitar players I admire and they also have, for example, the banjo rolls, {{going back to the}} open string, the drone...Basically with all the music I like, the drone is always present. Someone might look at my records and say it's schizophrenic, but there's always that element I hear. Maybe it's delusional, but it <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I guess. It's like the Hindu gods where they have all these different incarnations but it's still the same force behind it.|$|R
5000|$|Scott {{was also}} bass player and {{composer}} on their 1995 album A Day at the Beach.

[...] In 1998 Scott composed, produced, and played bass on their third album, My Secret Life, and their 1999 live album Lay Down and Love It Live. That year Scott was interviewed about the sound of the group and said, [...] "The best description I've heard that really <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> is that it's a collision of rock 'n' roll and R&B with a gospel seasoning."

5000|$|Rexha {{explained}} to Billboard why she wasn't initially credited as a featured artist on the track: [...] "We {{talked about it}} - I actually emailed Guetta about it. I {{really wanted to be}} featured on it, because, you know, I've been signed and dropped, and now signed a second time, so it's been hard. What ended up happening was that it looked like a lot of names on the title, so they wanted to keep as many low features as possible. That's what I was told, and it <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I guess more than two featured names doesn't look good on the radio. It's tough hearing your voice on the radio, on a chorus, and knowing that people think it's another artist." [...] As of June 2015, Rexha is officially credited in all instances of the song's mention.|$|R
5000|$|She then {{attended}} California State University, Northridge (CSUN) {{and earned}} her bachelor's degree in 1969 and master's degree in art in 1979.

She wanted to make art for the people she loved, but she knew that they didn't go to galleries. [...] "I thought to myself, if I get my work into galleries, who will go there?

My neighbors never went to galleries...And it didn't <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> at the time to put art behind some guarded wall."

5000|$|Some of the {{earliest}} examples of academic fandom were written on Star Trek zines, specifically K/S (Kirk/Spock) slash zines. Author Joanna Russ wrote in her 1985 analysis of K/S zines that slash fandom at the time consisted of around 500 core fans and was 100% female. She wrote that, [...] "K/S not only speaks to my condition. It is written in Female. I don't mean that literally, of course. What I mean is that I can read it without translating it from the consensual, public world, which is sexist, and unconcerned with women per se, and managing to make it <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and my condition." [...] Unlike women authors who write [...] "slant" [...] against traditional (male) literature, Russ says that K/S is an art that is [...] "truly ours." [...] Russ also observed that while SF fans looked down on Star Trek fans, Star Trek fans looked down on K/S writers.|$|E

500|$|The Make-Up's gospel {{attitude}} {{was related to}} utilization of the audience as a group member, which Svenonius likened {{to the rise of}} the 90s dance music scene: [...] "We're not interested in countering it. It <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that techno, rave and dance music should go over in the face of rock and roll because it's democratic for everybody to express themselves. [...] Whereas a lot of rock and roll isn't even entertaining at all, let alone allowing people the voice for expression. [...] That's what the Make-Up has come to remedy. [...] We want to be at once entertaining and inclusive in terms of using the gospel form to sort of breathe life into the old Frankenstein monster". [...] Svenonius would often interact with the audience in a number of ways, including call and response lyrics, direct address, and leaving the stage and going out into the crowd.|$|R
