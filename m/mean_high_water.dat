The Avonmouth Docks are {{on the north side of}} the river and are one of the UK's major ports for chilled foods, especially fruit and vegetables. The first dock at Avonmouth, Avonmouth Old Dock, was opened in 1877 and acquired by Bristol Corporation in 1884. In 1907, a much larger dock, the Royal Edward Dock, was opened. The docks form part of the Port of Bristol and were operated by the Port of Bristol Authority, part of Bristol City Council, until 1991 when the council granted a 150-year lease to the Bristol Port Company. Currently, pilotage is provided by Bristol Pilots LLP who supply authorised pilots for the River Avon and Bristol City docks, as well as the Severn estuary and the Bristol channel.

40|$|Floods {{are natural}} events {{that occur in}} {{depressed}} areas. These phenomena can be related with extreme river discharges in fluvial valleys or with wave surges in coastal areas. In estuarine areas, both causes can coincide during stormy periods.

The slatey-quartzitic character of the drainage area induces an immediate response of the fluvial flow to the rains.

2500|$|The Severn Bridge {{is located}} {{close to the}} former Aust Ferry.

In 1966 the cables supporting the bridge deck were spun from [...] of wire. The main cables are each made up of 8,322 individual [...] wires. An unusual feature of the suspension cables carrying the deck {{is that they are}} not vertical, as for most suspension bridges, but rather arranged in a zig-zag fashion, with adjacent mounts closely spaced. The triangulation this offers is an attempt to reduce vibration, as is the prominent use of Stockbridge dampers on the cables. The bridge is [...] long, consisting of a [...] central span between the towers and the two [...] side spans. The towers rise to [...] above <b>mean</b> <b>high</b> <b>water</b> and are of hollow box construction. The deck is an orthotropic steel box girder of aerofoil shape with cantilevered cycle tracks and footway supported from the box. The shape of the bridge was determined by the designers Freeman, Fox and Partners following wind tunnel tests for the Forth Road Bridge, after the original wind tunnel model was accidentally destroyed.

This study explored marine-derived nutrient inputs to adjacent terrestrial communities. We quantified wrack (seaweed and other organic matter) deposition at sites (Shi Shi Beach (SS), Giants Graveyard (GG), and Cape Alava (CA)) along the outer Olympic Peninsula, WA that created potential nitrogen sources serving nearby terrestrial communities. We found five dominant species of seaweed in wrack deposits with variation in dominance and biomass of wrack within sites and between sites. We attribute within site variation to flotation adaptations of species and intersite variation to differences in geomorphology and source population. Due to abundance and stable nitrogen concentrations over time, Phyllospadix was influential to total nitrogen deposition from <b>mean</b> <b>higher</b> <b>water</b> (MHHW) to ~ 1. 3 m above MHHW, however above this elevation Fucus, Macrocystis, and Nereocystis were likely influential species. Cape Alava showed highest total nitrogen deposit per m² followed by GG and SS (CA > SS ~=GG; = 65. 8; p< 0. 0001).

40|$|The {{quality of}} maps {{obtained}} by interpolation of observations {{of a target}} environmental variable at a restricted number of locations, is partly determined by the spatial pattern of the sample locations. A method is presented for optimization of the sample pattern when the environmental variable is interpolated {{with the help of}} exhaustively known covariates, which are assumed to be linearly related to the target variable. In this method the spatially averaged universal kriging variance (MUKV), which incorporates trend estimation error as well as spatial interpolation error, is minimized. The optimal pattern is obtained using simulated annealing. The method requires that the covariance function or variogram of the regression-residuals is known. The method is tested in a case study on the <b>Mean</b> <b>Highest</b> <b>Water</b> table in a coversand area in The Netherlands. The patterns of 25, 50 and 100 sample locations are optimized and compared with the patterns optimized with the ordinary kriging (OK) model (assuming no trend) and with the multiple linear regression (MLR) model (assuming no spatial autocorrelation of residuals). The results show that the UK-patterns are a good compromise between spreading in geographic space and feature space. The MUKV for the UK-patterns is 19 % (n = 25), 7 % (n = 50) and 3 % (n = 100) smaller than for the OK-patterns. Compared with the MLR-patterns the reduction is 2 %, 4 % and 4 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Spartina spp. (cordgrasses) often dominates {{intertidal}} mudflats and/or low marshes. The landward {{invasion of}} these species was typically thought to be restrained by low tidal inundation frequencies and interspecific competition. We noticed that the reported soil salinity levels in some salt marshes were much higher than those at the <b>mean</b> <b>higher</b> <b>high</b> <b>water</b> level, which might inhibit the landward invasion of cordgrass. To test this possibility, we transplanted Spartina alterniflora across an elevational gradient in an invaded salt marsh in the Yellow River Delta National Nature Reserve, where a salt accumulation zone (i. e., salt barren) was previously observed. We found that S. alterniflora was significantly inhibited by the salt barren in high marsh regions, although it performed better at upland and low marsh regions. A common garden experiment further elucidated that S. alterniflora performed best at low salinity levels and that this species is less sensitive to inundation frequency. Our {{results indicated that the}} salt barren inhibited the landward invasion of S. alterniflora in salt marshes and provided a natural barrier to protect the upland from invasion. Though field observations suggest that S. alterniflora could propagate along tidal channels, which provide low-salinity corridors for the dispersal of propagules, natural salt barrens can inhibit the landward invasion of Spartina in salt marshes. However, artificial disturbances that break the salt barren band in salt marshes (e. g., artificial ditches) might accelerate the invasion of Spartina spp. This new finding should alert salt marsh managers to pay attention to artificial ditches and/or other human activities when attempting to control Spartina invasion...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Shutter-speed model {{analysis}} of dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging allows estimation of mean intracellular water molecule lifetime (a measure of cellular energy metabolism) and volume transfer constant (a measure of hemodynamics). The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the prognostic utility of pretreatment mean intracellular water molecule lifetime and volume transfer constant in predicting overall survival in patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck and to stratify p 16 -positive patients based upon survival outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 60 patients underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging before treatment. Median, mean intracellular water molecule lifetime and volume transfer constant values from metastatic nodes were computed from each patient. Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to associate mean intracellular water molecule lifetime and volume transfer constant and their combination with overall survival for the first 2 years, 5 years, and beyond (median duration, > 7 years). RESULTS: By the last date of observation, 18 patients had died, and median follow-up for surviving patients (n = 42) was 8. 32 years. Patients with <b>high</b> <b>mean</b> intracellular <b>water</b> molecule lifetime (4 deaths) had significantly (P =. 01) prolonged overall survival by 5 years compared with those with low mean intracellular water molecule lifetime (13 deaths). Similarly, patients with <b>high</b> <b>mean</b> intracellular <b>water</b> molecule lifetime (4 deaths) had significantly (P =. 006) longer overall survival at long-term duration than those with low mean intracellular water molecule lifetime (14 deaths). However, volume transfer constant was a significant predictor for only the 5 -year follow-up period. There was some evidence (P <. 10) to suggest that mean intracellular water molecule lifetime and volume transfer constant were associated with overall survival for the first 2 years. Patients with <b>high</b> <b>mean</b> intracellular <b>water</b> molecule lifetime and high volume transfer constant were associated with significantly (P <. 01) longer overall survival compared with other groups for all follow-up periods. In addition, p 16 -positive patients with <b>high</b> <b>mean</b> intracellular <b>water</b> molecule lifetime and high volume transfer constant demonstrated a trend toward the longest overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: A combined {{analysis of}} mean intracellular water molecule lifetime and volume transfer constant provided the best model to predict overall survival in patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck...|$|R
40|$|We {{assess whether}} or not {{restored}} marshes in the San Francisco Estuary {{are expected to be}} sustainable in light of future landscape scale geomorphic processes given typical restored marsh conditions. Our assessment is based on a review of the literature, appraisal of monitoring data for restored marshes, and application of vertical accretion modeling of organic and inorganic sedimentation. Vertical accretion modeling suggests that salt marshes in San Pablo Bay will be sustainable for moderate relative sea level rise (3 to 5 mm yr- 1) and average sediment supply (c. 100 mg L- 1). Accelerated relative sea level rise (above 6 mm yr- 1) and/or reduced sediment supply (50 mg L- 1) will cause lowering of the marsh surface relative to the tide range and may cause shifts from high to low marsh vegetation by the year 2100. Widespread conversion of marsh to mudflat-"ecological drowning"-is not expected within this time frame. Marshes restored at lower elevations necessary to aid the natural development of channel systems (c. 0. 5 m below <b>mean</b> <b>higher</b> <b>high</b> <b>water)</b> are predicted to accrete to high marsh elevations by the year 2100 for moderate relative sea level rise and sediment supply conditions. Existing rates of sediment accretion in restored fresh water tidal marshes of the Delta of greater than 9 mm yr- 1 and slightly lower drowning elevations suggest that these marshes will be resilient against relatively high rates of sea level rise. Because of higher rates of organic production, fresh water marshes are expected to be less sensitive to reduced sediment availability than salt marshes. The ultimate long-term threat to the sustainability of tidal marshes is the interruption of coastal rollover-the process by which landward marsh expansion in response to sea level rise compensates for shoreline erosion. Bay front development now prevents most landward marsh expansion, while shoreline erosion is expected to accelerate as sea level rises...|$|R
