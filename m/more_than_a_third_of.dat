Unfit for the first two Tests against South Africa, he chose to miss the next two, and played in the final game, scoring 10 and 52. Critics observed a general slowing in Hobbs' scoring throughout the season, and he scored more often in singles than in his earlier years.|$|E
5|$|The Croatian {{language}} {{is the official}} language of Croatia, and one of 24 official languages of the European Union since 2013. Minority languages are in official use in local government units where <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the population consists of national minorities or where local legislation mandates their use. These languages are Czech, Hungarian, Italian, Ruthenian, Serbian and Slovak.

5|$|Denmark's Sterling Airways bought ILG's {{share of}} Norway Airlines in mid July. The {{airlines}} announced a partnership, which also included Transwede. The Wallenberg-controlled NRT owned a 48-percent stake in Sterling and 66 percent of Transwede—the remaining third owned by Sterling. The three airlines applied for concessions {{to operate on}} the capital triangle between Oslo, Copenhagen and Stockholm. SAS held a monopoly on these routes and the airlines intended to capture the leisure market between the capital regions. Both ILG and Sterling were hindered in owning <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> Norway Airlines because of Norwegian corporate legislation. Fokus Bank had gradually become the largest shareholder in Norway Airline and owned 40.6 {{percent of the company}} in July 1991.

5|$|Odex's {{actions against}} file sharing were legal actions against Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and their {{subscribers}} in Singapore by Odex, a Singapore-based company that virtually distributes sub-licensed Japanese anime. From early 2007 to January 2008 Odex took action against {{anyone who had}} downloaded anime through BitTorrent for alleged copyright infringement. Odex tracked their IP addresses without their consent and sought subpoenas to compel the ISPs to disclose the personal details of these subscribers. After rulings from the Subordinate Courts, Odex took personal data from affected ISPs and sent letters demanding payment in place of litigation. <b>More</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the individuals contacted by Odex opted to settle out of court for at least S$3,000 (US$2,000) to S$5,000 (US$4,000) each.|$|E

The port accounts for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> economic activity {{of the town of}} Calais. Cargo traffic has tripled over the past two decades. In 2007 more than 41.5 million tonnes of traffic passed through Calais with some 11.52 million passengers, 1.4 million trucks and trailers, 2.249 million cars and 4,700 crossings a year. On average, ships sail from the port every 30 minutes. A new 400 million euro project is underway at the port to create a breakwater protecting a pool of 700 meters long, thus allowing virtually all types of ships to stop at Calais.|$|E

5|$|The breed {{is popular}} for {{recreational}} and competitive driving, {{to which it}} is well suited in temperament. In 1997, the rules of driving events in France were modified {{to take into account the}} speed of execution of the course, which made lighter, faster horses more competitive. The Norman Cob and the lighter type of Boulonnais were particularly affected. The Norman Cob's gaits, calm temperament and willingness to master technical movements make it an excellent competitor, and in 2011, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the horses represented in the French driving championships were Norman Cobs.

The year began well, and in July, he knocked <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> a second off the 200 m CAC Championship record with a run of 20.03 s, then registered his 200 m season's best at London's Crystal Palace, running in 19.99 s.|$|E
5|$|After {{shooting}} Liniers, Castelli returned {{briefly to}} Buenos Aires and met Moreno. The secretary of war congratulated {{him for his}} conduct, and appointed him as a member representing the Junta, with full power to direct the operations to La Paz. He also left a series of instructions: Castelli was to put {{the government in the}} hands of patriots, earn the native's support, and shoot president Nieto, governor Sanz, and the Bishop of La Paz, in the case of their capture. He received similar orders to capture and execute José Manuel de Goyeneche, who had already defeated the rebels of La Paz revolution (a rebellion similar to the May Revolution, which took place at La Paz, modern Bolivia). Castelli was also instructed to rescue and draft to the Auxiliary Army the Arribeños and Patricians soldiers that, under the command of Vicente Nieto, had left Buenos Aires in 1809 to suppress revolutions in Chuquisaca and La Paz. Suspicious of those soldiers, Nieto had them disarmed and sent as prisoners to the mines of Potosi, under the supervision of Francisco de Paula Sanz. <b>More</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the soldiers died within a month of work in the mines.|$|E

5|$|At Dürenstein a {{combined}} force of Russian and Austrian troops trapped a French division commanded by Théodore Maxime Gazan. The French division {{was part of}} the newly created VIII Corps, the so-called Corps Mortier, under command of Édouard Mortier. In pursuing the Austrian retreat from Bavaria, Mortier had over-extended his three divisions along the north bank of the Danube. Mikhail Kutuzov, commander of the Coalition force, enticed Mortier to send Gazan's division into a trap and French troops were caught in a valley between two Russian columns. They were rescued by the timely arrival of a second division, under command of Pierre Dupont de l'Étang. The battle extended well into the night, after which both sides claimed victory. The French lost <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> their participants, and Gazan's division experienced over 40percent losses. The Austrians and Russians also had heavy losses—close to 16percent—but perhaps the most significant was the death in action of Johann Heinrich von Schmitt, one of Austria's most capable chiefs of staff.|$|E
5|$|Damage to Forte was extensive. The {{stern and}} side facing Sybille {{had been beaten}} in by gunfire as more than 300 shot holes {{combined}} to form gaping holes in hull above the waterline. As well as the masts the bulkheads had been smashed apart and all deck furniture blasted to splinters. 65 of the crew had been killed, including Captain Beaulieu, and approximately 80 wounded, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the crew listed as casualties; many of the wounded later died {{from the effects of}} amputation. Damages to Sybille were considerably lighter: only six shot had struck the hull in the entire battle: one gun was dismounted, but the worst damage was to Cooke's cabin where a round shot had destroyed most of his furniture. In addition, most of the damage to the masts and rigging proved superficial. Just five crew were killed outright, with another 17 wounded, the latter including Cooke. The British captain had been struck in the left arm, the shot exiting near his spine, with additional injuries to the chest and right arm. He eventually died after a long and agonising deterioration at Calcutta on 25 May 1799 and was buried under a monument with full military honours. A memorial was subsequently placed in Westminster Abbey in his memory.|$|E
5|$|Humans play a {{key role}} in the biosphere, with the large human {{population}} dominating many of Earth's ecosystems. This has resulted in a widespread, ongoing mass extinction of other species during the present geological epoch, now known as the Holocene extinction. The large-scale loss of species caused by human influence since the 1950s has been called a biotic crisis, with an estimated 10% of the total species lost as of 2007. At current rates, about 30% of species are at risk of extinction in the next hundred years. The Holocene extinction event is the result of habitat destruction, the widespread distribution of invasive species, hunting, and climate change. In the present day, human activity has had a significant impact on the surface of the planet. <b>More</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the land surface has been modified by human actions, and humans use about 20% of global primary production. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by close to 30% since the start of the Industrial Revolution.|$|E
50|$|The {{population}} of the Town of Perušić has fallen by <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> between 1991 and 2011. Reasons for this include the emigration of population to more developed areas, attacks during the War of Independence, the aging population, and frequent flooding.|$|R

5|$|Subsistence crops {{grown in}} the country include matoke (green bananas), which occupy <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the country's farmland, potatoes, beans, sweet potatoes, cassava, wheat and maize. Coffee and tea are the major cash crops for export, with the high altitudes, steep slopes and {{volcanic}} soils providing favourable conditions. Reports, have established that more than 400,000 Rwandans, make their living from coffee plantation. Reliance on agricultural exports makes Rwanda vulnerable to shifts in their prices. Animals raised in Rwanda include cows, goats, sheep, pigs, chicken, and rabbits, with geographical variation {{in the numbers of}} each. Production systems are mostly traditional, although there are a few intensive dairy farms around Kigali. Shortages of land and water, insufficient and poor-quality feed, and regular disease epidemics with insufficient veterinary services are major constraints that restrict output. Fishing takes place on the country's lakes, but stocks are very depleted, and live fish are being imported in an attempt to revive the industry.|$|E
5|$|After {{passing the}} Swan Islands, Janet made {{landfall}} on the Yucatán Peninsula between Corozal Town, British Honduras, and Chetumal, Mexico, at 1700UTC on September28. At the time, it had winds of 175mph (280km/h). Hurricane force winds were reported {{for two hours}} preceding the hurricane's landfall, with numerous pressure readings below 948mbar (hPa; 28.00inHg). Roads and crops on the peninsula sustained heavy damage due to Janet. In Xcalak, Quintana Roo, the strong winds from Janet flattened the port's infrastructure, and only one house remained intact after the storm's passage. 97people were killed in Xcalak, constituting <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the port's population. Chetumal, Mexico was devastated, with only four buildings left standing. Storm surge pushed water {{to a depth of}} 6.5feet (2m), 1600ft (490m) inland, despite the peninsula protecting the city from the open ocean. The death toll in Chetumal remains uncertain; 120bodies were recovered in the city but it is unknown how many were ever found. An additional 10,000people in the city were left homeless after the hurricane, and were forced to sleep in the open overnight. Federal relief agencies previously providing service for areas affected by Hurricanes Gladys and Hilda earlier in the year in western areas of the Gulf Coast of Mexico were ordered to extend relief operations to the Yucatán Peninsula. In Quintana Roo, Hurricane Janet was estimated to have caused $40million in damages and at least 500deaths, the most of any region affected by Janet.|$|E
5|$|While II Canadian Corps pushed {{south from}} Caen toward Falaise in Operation Totalize on 8 August, Bradley and Montgomery {{realised}} {{that there was}} an opportunity for the bulk of the German forces to be trapped at Falaise. The Third Army continued the encirclement from the south, reaching Alençon on 11August. Although Hitler continued to insist until 14 August that his forces should counter-attack, Kluge and his officers began planning a retreat eastward. The German forces were severely hampered by Hitler's insistence on making all major decisions himself, which left his forces without orders for periods as long as 24 hours while information was sent {{back and forth to the}} Führer's residence at Obersalzberg in Bavaria. On the evening of 12 August, Patton asked Bradley if his forces should continue northward to close the gap and encircle the German forces. Bradley refused, because Montgomery had already assigned the First Canadian Army to take the territory from the north. The Canadians met heavy resistance and captured Falaise on 16 August. The gap was closed on 21 August, trapping 50,000 German troops but <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the German 7th Army and the remnants of nine of the eleven Panzer divisions had escaped to the east. Montgomery's decision-making regarding the Falaise Gap was criticised at the time by American commanders, especially Patton, although Bradley was more sympathetic and believed Patton would not have been able to close the gap. The issue has been the subject of much discussion among historians, criticism being levelled at American, British and Canadian forces. Hitler relieved Kluge of his command of OB West on 15 August and replaced him with Field Marshal Walter Model. Kluge committed suicide on 19 August after Hitler became aware of his involvement in the 20 July plot. An invasion in southern France (Operation Dragoon) was launched on 15 August.|$|E
