500|$|On February 27, 2011, he and Anne Hathaway {{hosted the}} 83rd Academy Awards. The two were {{selected}} to help the awards show achieve its goal of attracting a younger audience. Franco had previously said that he accepted the job for the experience {{and because it was}} a once in a lifetime opportunity. Numerous media viewers criticized Franco for his discontent and lack of energy on stage and the show was widely panned, with some reviewers dubbing it the worst telecast in its history. The actor later spoke about his hosting in an interview on the Late Show with David Letterman. He explained that when accepting the job he never had high hopes, adding [...] "It was never on <b>my</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> things to do. It doesn't mean I didn't care and it doesn't mean I didn't try, right?” Regarding allegations that he was under the influence of marijuana while hosting, Franco commented [...] "I think the Tasmanian Devil would look stoned standing next to Anne Hathaway. She has a lot of energy!" [...] He concluded that he tried his best and could have had [...] "low energy" [...] during the telecast.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the death}} of {{terrorist}} Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011, a resurgence in the popularity of [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] video occurred. The official YouTube video was flooded with comments regarding {{the death of}} bin Laden and it was immediately deemed a celebratory anthem for the event. Moreover, the song's association to his death continued on other social medias, like Facebook and Twitter, and it was played as individuals celebrated outside of the White House. About it becoming an anthem for bin Laden's death, Nitsuh Abebe of New York magazine wrote, [...] "I have to confess that <b>my</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> reactions to the news did not get anywhere near 'watch a Miley Cyrus video.' The reason it occurred to others is surely {{as simple as it}} seems: This is a recent hit song whose title is dominated by the words [...] "party" [...] and [...] "U.S.A." [...] Looking for anything more apt would be overthinking it. Cyrus' video [...] is stocked with a great many of those things we like and do well: a drive-in theater, trucks and muscle cars, Daisy Dukes, giant flags. It is, just like bin Laden's death, another convenient opportunity to celebrate ourselves." ...|$|E
500|$|Peel was {{the first}} English bowler to take 100 Test wickets against Australia. At a time when {{international}} matches were relatively rare, his 20 Test matches were a considerable achievement, and it was unusual for a player to tour Australia {{as often as he}} did: he went there four times. His main rival as a spinner and for a place in the England team was Johnny Briggs; Peel bowled faster, which made him harder to hit. Archie MacLaren, who captained England from the late 1890s and was a team-mate and captain of Briggs, described Peel as [...] "the cleverest bowler of my time". MacLaren stated that Peel thoroughly understood tactics and could spot weaknesses in a batsman's technique. He concluded: [...] "I place Peel first on <b>my</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> great left-handed bowlers on account of his wonderful judgement, his diabolical cleverness and his great natural ability." [...] When Rhodes took over the role of left-arm spin bowler in the Yorkshire team, there was some debate over who out of Peate, Peel and Rhodes was the best left-arm spinner to play for Yorkshire. Historians regard Peel as part of a long-lasting chain of successful Yorkshire left-arm spinners, preceded by Peate and succeeded by Rhodes.|$|E

[...] It's great to see the audience loving it. I suppose I had reservations as far as…well…the idea of doing scenes from a film on stage. I just don’t get the point of it. They do them terribly well…I mean, they really are good…but I just quite don’t understand what that's about. [...] It isn’t really 'Python.' It is very much Eric." [...] Jones went on to say, [...] "...I think {{the best parts of}} the musical are the new things. For instance, when they do the Andrew Lloyd Webber take-off and this girl comes in and sings 'Whatever Happened to My Part' since she hasn’t appeared since the opening number and she's really furious!

40|$|Outrages is Chapter XIV of my {{biography}} of Thomas Wharton, 5 th Baron, 1 st Earl, and 1 st Marquess of Wharton (Tom Wharton to his friends, his present biographer, and the English political {{world of the}} Revolution period). The story covers the events between November 1681 and February 1683 -between {{the trial of the}} Earl of Shaftesbury and the Rye House Plot. It covers the most forgettable episode in Wharton's personal life-one that may be charitably described as disgraceful; and it deals with the tortured, serio-comic romance between Wharton's wife Anne and his brother Goodwin. Politically, the story traces some of the stages in the decline of the Whig party before the disasters of 1683. I am sure that the scandalous episodes will be understandable to any literate adult; and I hope the political episodes will be understandable as well. In any event, they include some crucial developments in English history.
