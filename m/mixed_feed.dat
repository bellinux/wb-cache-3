40|$|Abstract Background Women gain {{total body}} weight and accrue body fat during pregnancy. Breastfeeding has been {{suggested}} as an efficient means of promoting postpartum weight loss due to its high energy cost. We investigated the effect of infant feeding mode on maternal body composition. Methods This study evaluated maternal weight and percent body fat changes in exclusively breastfeeding versus <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding</b> mothers during the first 12 weeks postpartum using the BOD POD. Twenty four mothers aged 19 – 42 years were studied. Participants were recruited from Athens-Clarke County and surrounding areas of the State of Georgia, USA. The study was conducted between November 2005 and December 2006. Results Prepregnancy weight was higher in <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding</b> mothers than in exclusively breastfeeding mothers (68. 4 kg vs. 61. 4 kg) but {{the difference was not}} statistically significant. At 12 weeks postpartum, exclusively breastfeeding mothers had lost more total body weight than <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding</b> mothers (4. 41 ± 4. 10 kg versus 2. 79 ± 3. 09 kg; p = 0. 072). There {{was no significant difference in}} fat weight change between the two groups (4. 38 ± 2. 06 kg versus 4. 17 ± 2. 63 kg). However, <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding</b> mothers lost slightly more percent body fat than exclusively breastfeeding mothers (1. 90 ± 4. 18 kg versus 1. 71 ± 3. 48 kg), but the difference was not statistically significant. The trend in percent body fat loss was significant among exclusively breastfeeding mothers (p = 0. 034) but not <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding</b> mothers (p = 0. 081). Exclusively breastfeeding mothers consumed more calories than <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding</b> mothers (1980 ± 618 kcal versus 1541 ± 196 kcal p = 0. 08). Physical activity levels were, however, higher in <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding</b> mothers than exclusively breastfeeding mothers. Conclusion Our results provide further evidence that exclusive breastfeeding promotes greater weight loss than <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding</b> among mothers even in the early postpartum period. This suggests that there is the need to encourage mothers to exclusively breastfeed as a means of overweight and obesity prevention. </p...|$|R

50|$|The {{feed gas}} (consisting {{of at least}} two components) first enters a section with an {{arrangement}} of static blades or wings, which induce a fast swirl in the gas.Thereafter the gas stream flows through a Laval nozzle, where it accelerates to supersonic speeds and undergoes a deep pressure drop to about 30% of feed pressure. This is a near isentropic process and the corresponding temperature reduction leads to condensation of target components of the <b>mixed</b> <b>feed</b> gas, which form a fine mist. The droplets agglomerate to larger drops, and the swirl of the gas causes cyclonic separation.The dry gas continues forward, while the liquid phase together with some slip gas (about 30% of the total stream) is separated by a concentric divider and exits the device as a separate stream. The final section are diffusers for both streams, where the gas is slowed down and about 80% of the feed pressure (depending on application) is recovered. This section might also include another set of static devices to undo the swirling motion.|$|E

50|$|Meat {{and bone}} meal {{can be a}} risk factor for bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE), when healthy animals consume tainted tissues from infected animals. People concerned about Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), which is also a spongiform encephalopathy, may favor grass-fed cattle for this reason. In the United States, this risk is relatively low as feeding of protein sources from any ruminant to another ruminant has been banned since 1997. The problem becomes more complicated as other feedstuffs containing animal by-products are still allowed to be fed to other non-ruminants (chickens, cats, dogs, horses, pigs, etc.). Therefore, at a feed mill mixing feed for pigs, for instance, there is still the possibility of cross-contamination of feed going to cattle. Since only a tiny amount of the contaminating prion begins the cascading brain disease, any amount of <b>mixed</b> <b>feed</b> could cause many animals to become infected. This was the only traceable link among the cattle with BSE in Canada that led to the recent US embargo of Canadian beef. No cases of BSE have been reported so far in Australia. This is largely due to Australia's strict quarantine and bio-security rules that prohibit beef imports from countries known to be infected with BSE.|$|E

40|$|Global climate {{shifts and}} {{ecological}} flexibility {{are two major}} factors that may affect rates of speciation and extinction across clades. Here, we connect past climate to changes in diet and diversification dynamics of ruminant mammals. Using novel versions of Multi-State Speciation and Extinction models, we explore the most likely scenarios for evolutionary transitions among diets in this clade and ask whether ruminant lineages with different feeding styles (browsing, grazing and <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding)</b> underwent differential rates of diversification concomitant with global temperature change. The best model of trait change had transitions from browsers to grazers via <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding,</b> with appreciable rates of transition to and from grazing and <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding.</b> Diversification rates in mixed-feeder and grazer lineages tracked the palaeotemperature curve, exhibiting higher rates during the Miocene thermal maxima. The origination of facultative mixed diet and grazing states may have triggered two adaptive radiations - one during the Oligocene-Miocene transition and the other during Middle-to-Late Miocene. Our estimate of mixed diets for basal lineages of both bovids and cervids is congruent with fossil evidence, while the reconstruction of browser ancestors for some impoverished clades - Giraffidae and Tragulidae - is not. Our results offer model-based neontological support to previous palaeontological findings and fossil-based hypothesis highlighting the importance of dietary innovations - especially <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding</b> - {{in the success of}} ruminants during the Neogene. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of routine HIV counselling and testing (HCT) {{has increased the}} number of pregnant women being tested and receiving prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) interventions in South Africa. While many women may enroll in PMTCT, there are barriers that hinder the success of PMTCT programmes. The success of the PMTCT is dependent on the optimal utilization of PMTCT interventions which require the support of the woman’s partner, and other members of her family. We conducted focus groups interviews with 25 HIV-positive post-natal women enrolled in PMTCT, in the City of Tshwane, South Africa. The study explored HIV-positive status disclosure to partners and significant family members and assessed the effect of nondisclosure on exclusive infant feeding. Most women disclosed to partners while few disclosed to significant family members.

It was found that steam and CO have significant inhibitive effects on hydrogen permeation through the membrane due to their competitive adsorption with hydrogen on the metallic surface at temperatures less than 623 K, whereas, CO 2 displayed only slight inhibitive effect at these temperatures.

40|$|Mixed matrix {{membranes}} (MMMs) {{with low}} particle loadings {{have been shown}} to improve the properties of pure polymers for many gas separations. Comparatively few reports have been made for high particle loading (≥ 50 vol. %) MMMs. In this work, CO 2 -CH 4 feeds were used to study the potential of 50 vol. % zeolite 4 A-poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) MMMs for natural gas separations. A low CO 2 partial pressure <b>mixed</b> <b>feed</b> probed MMM performance below the plasticization pressure of PVAc and a high CO 2 partial pressure <b>mixed</b> <b>feed</b> probed MMM performance at industrially relevant conditions above the plasticization pressure. Under both <b>mixed</b> <b>feed</b> conditions at 35 °C, substantial improvements in overall separation performance were observed. At low CO 2 partial pressures, CO 2 permeability roughly doubled with a nearly 50 % increase in selectivity versus pure PVAc under the same conditions. For the high CO 2 partial pressure feed, CO 2 permeability remained effectively unchanged with a 63 % increase in selectivity versus pure PVAc. Surprisingly, the performance of these PVAc based MMMs approached the properties of current " upper bound" polymers. Overall, this work shows that significantly improved performance MMMs can be made with traditional techniques from a low cost, low performance polymer without costly adhesion promoters. © 2010...|$|E
