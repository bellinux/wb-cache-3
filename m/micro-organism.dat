40|$|A {{method of}} {{characterization}} of airborne <b>micro-organisms</b> {{in a given}} location involves (1) large-volume filtration of air onto glass-fiber filters; (2) accelerated extraction of membrane lipids of the collected <b>micro-organisms</b> by use of pressurized hot liquid; and (3) identification and quantitation of the lipids by use of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. This method is suitable for use in both outdoor and indoor environments; for example, {{it can be used}} to measure airborne microbial contamination in buildings ("sick-building syndrome"). The classical approach to analysis of airborne <b>micro-organisms</b> is based on the growth of cultureable <b>micro-organisms</b> and does not provide an account of viable but noncultureable <b>micro-organisms,</b> which typically amount to more than 90 percent of the <b>micro-organisms</b> present. In contrast, the present method provides an account of all <b>micro-organisms,</b> including cultureable, noncultureable, aerobic, and anaerobic ones. The analysis of lipids according to this method makes it possible to estimate the number of viable airborne <b>micro-organisms</b> present in the sampled air and to obtain a quantitative profile of the general types of <b>micro-organisms</b> present along with some information about their physiological statuses...|$|R

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{direct contact with}} the soil, roots are exposed to colonizing <b>micro-organisms</b> that persist after the plant has died. These <b>micro-organisms</b> may affect {{intrinsic}} root-chemical quality and the kinetics of root residue decomposition in soil, or interact with soil <b>micro-organisms</b> during the decomposition process. The aims in this work were i) to determine the interactions between the presence of root-colonizing <b>micro-organisms</b> and root-chemical quality and ii) to quantify the effect of these <b>micro-organisms</b> on root decomposition. Roots were selected from six maize genotypes cultivated in the field and harvested at physiological maturity. The roots of two genotypes (F 2 and F 2 bm 1) had a higher N content, lower neutral sugars content and higher Klason lignin content than the other genotypes (F 292, F 292 bm 3, Mexxal, Colombus). Location of the root residue <b>micro-organisms</b> by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed that F 2 and F 2 bm 1 roots were more colonized than roots of the other genotypes. Electron Dispersive X-Ray microanalyses of in situ N confirmed a higher N content in the colonizing <b>micro-organisms</b> than in the root cell walls. Residues of F 2 and F 2 bm 1 roots decomposed more slowly {{and to a lesser extent}} than those of the other genotypes during incubation in a silty loam soil under controlled conditions (15 °C, - 80 kPa). After 49 days, 40. 6 % of the total C from F 292 was mineralized but only 20. 7 % of from F 2 bm 1. These results suggest that residue-colonizing <b>micro-organisms</b> decompose the cell-wall sugars to varying extents before soil decomposition thereby modifying the chemical quality of the residues and their mineralization pattern in soil. Due to their high N content, colonizing <b>micro-organisms</b> also impact on the total N content of root residues, reducing their C to N ratio. Gamma sterilized root residues were incubated under the same conditions as non-sterilized residues to see if <b>micro-organisms</b> colonizing root residues could modify the action of soil <b>micro-organisms</b> during decomposition. Similar C mineralization rates were observed for both non-sterilized and sterilized residues, indicating that the residue <b>micro-organisms</b> did not quantitatively affect the activity of soil <b>micro-organisms...</b>|$|R

Anthropomorphic ideas seem to help children to explain their understanding of some aspects of <b>micro-organisms</b> but the imbalance in children’s anthropocentric views of <b>micro-organisms</b> appears to prohibit them considering other aspects of micro-organisms; for example, the importance of their role in decomposition and cycling of matter, or their beneficial technological applications.

Since a healthy brood nest is an essential stimulant for the foraging activities of the bees and knowing that fungi and yeast may be able to cause infections of the brood, the effect of two antagonistic <b>micro-organisms</b> is tested on the honey bee and bumble bee brood. Eggs and larvae were contaminated and during the larval and pupal phase, samples were taken and checked for the presence these antagonistic <b>micro-organisms.</b> The antagonistic <b>micro-organisms</b> were not found in the samples and no significant changes in the broodnest were observed.

40|$|SUMMARY Good {{stable soil}} {{structure}} is valuable for promoting {{the growth of}} plants and <b>micro-organisms</b> by permitting enhanced aeration and water penetration and by decreasing erosion under some conditions. <b>Micro-organisms</b> influence water percolation through the soil. They may plug up soil pores with byproducts of growth and reduce water percolation. On the other hand, if a soil containing {{a large amount of}} microbial products is stirred and allowed to dry, then the percolation may be high. <b>Micro-organisms</b> are involved in stabilizing soil structure by their products of decomposition and their cellular binding material, such as mycelia. Microorganisms differ greatly in their ability to stabilize soil structure. Restricting the microflora to superior soil structure stabilizing <b>micro-organisms</b> materially increases soil structure stability. This restriction is accomplished under laboratory conditions by first eliminating the indigenous soil flora and then introducing the desired <b>micro-organisms.</b> Indigenous flora can be eliminated by autoclaving or by the use of a soil fumigant such as chloropicrin. Some fumigants, such as urea-formaldehyde and biuret-urea-formaldehyde at certain critical concentrations, selectively eliminate soil <b>micro-organisms,</b> leaving only effective soil aggregators. Physical and chemical factors, such as temperature, moisture, and amount and nature of energy material, affect the growth and effectiveness of soil structure stabilizing <b>micro-organisms.</b> The use of superior <b>micro-organisms</b> for changing nutrient availability, nitrogen fixation, and soil structure stabilization may permit a. degree of control over plant growth which heretofore has been impossible...|$|R

2500|$|Followers of Jainism {{believe that}} all living organisms whether they are <b>micro-organism</b> are living and have a soul, and have one or more senses out of five senses and they {{go to great lengths}} to {{minimise}} any harm to any living organism. Most Jains are lacto-vegetarians but more devout Jains do not eat root vegetables because they believe that root vegetables contain a lot more micro-organisms as compared to other vegetables, and that, by eating them, violence of these micro-organisms is inevitable. So they focus on eating beans and fruits, whose cultivation do not involve killing of a lot of micro-organisms. No products obtained from dead animals are allowed, because when a living beings dies, a lot of micro-organisms (called as decomposers) will reproduce in the body which decomposes the body, and in eating the dead bodies, violence of decomposers is inevitable. Jain monks usually do a lot of fasting, and when they knew through spiritual powers that their life is very little, they start fasting until death. Some particularly dedicated individuals are fruitarians. Honey is forbidden, because honey is the regurgitation of nectar by bees [...] and may also contain eggs, excreta and dead bees. Some Jains do not consume plant parts that grow underground such as roots and bulbs, because tiny animals may be killed when the plants are pulled up.|$|E
