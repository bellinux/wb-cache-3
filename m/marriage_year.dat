5000|$|It was {{not until}} January 1955 that Edith Honecker-Baumann agreed to give her husband a divorce. Soon after this Honecker married Margot Feist.

50|$|Not {{long after}} moving to Marlin, Rapson married his first wife, Mrs. Willie Helen (Williams) Magee Rapson, who was {{thirteen}} years his elder. Even though their <b>marriage</b> <b>year</b> is not known, they were married and living together in Falls County, Texas by 1930 according to the U.S. Census that year. Rapson was only six years older than his wife's only son, Charles Ross Magee. Rapson's wife died on 24 August 1933 and is buried in Calvary Cemetery in Marlin, Texas. In 1935, {{less than two years}} after his first wife died, Rapson married his second wife, Ida Christian Feller, who was also a widow who had been living outside of Marlin, Texas in the small unincorporated village of Otto. After their marriage and sometime near the beginning of 1936, the couple moved to Marlin and operated a small store located on the outskirts of town. On his 1942 World War II draft card for men born between 1877-1897, Rapson stated his occupation was as a service station owner and a grocer. In 1950, after nearly fourteen years of business, Rapson and his wife sold their business to distant relatives of his wife and the couple moved to Mart, Texas and lived in a ramshakle house. The couple eventually moved back to Marlin, Texas less than two years later in January 1952.|$|E

30|$|Drawing {{from the}} data {{collected}} in the 2010 China Family Panel Study (CFPS) baseline survey, this paper studies the changing divorce pattern in Chinese marriages {{as a whole and}} for four cohorts. We find an inverted U-shape pattern in the divorce risk for Chinese marriages with the peak coming earlier over time. Family life cycle theory, natural evolvement theory, and population heterogeneity theory provide three different perspectives on interpreting the “inverted-U” shape divorce pattern. Family life cycle theory and natural evolvement theory are not supported by the data; however, population heterogeneity theory fits the data quite well. Split-population model shows that divorce risk for divorced couples increase linearly with marriage duration. However, the curve must come down at the end since {{the majority of the population}} does not divorce. By comparing four cohorts divided by <b>marriage</b> <b>year,</b> we find that the proportion of divorced couples has increased over time and the slope of the risk function for divorced couples has increased rapidly.|$|E
40|$|This article {{provides}} the first systematic {{examination of the}} voting motivations of Conservative MPs in the final parliamentary ballot of the Conservative Party leadership election of 2016. We identify the voting behaviour of each Conservative parliamentarian {{as part of a}} unique data set that we use to test, through the use of multivariate analysis, a series of hypotheses based around social background variables (i. e. gender and education); political variables (i. e. parliamentary experience, electoral marginality, the electoral threat posed by UKIP and ministerial status); and ideological variables (i. e. attitudes towards same-sex marriage and Brexit). Our findings demonstrate that ideology did matter in terms of voting. Attitudes towards Brexit were central to the appeals of both Theresa May (to Remainers) and Andrea Leadsom (to Leavers). We also demonstrate that in terms of support for Leadsom, Brexit was not the only significant driver, as opinion on same-sex <b>marriage,</b> <b>year</b> of entry and ministerial status also influenced voting behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Colon cancer {{surveillance}} guidelines do not routinely include positron {{emission tomography}} (PET) imaging; however, its use after surgical resection has been increasing. We evaluated the secular patterns of PET use after surgical resection of colon cancer among elderly patients and identified factors associated with its increasing use. Patients and Methods: We used the SEER-linked Medicare database (July 2001 through December 2009) to establish a retrospective cohort of patients age 66 years who had under-gone surgical resection for colon cancer. Postoperative PET use was assessed with the test for trends. Patient, tumor, and treat-ment characteristics were analyzed using univariable and multi-variable logistic regression analyses. Results: Of the 39, 221 patients with colon cancer, 6, 326 (16. 1 %) had undergone a PET scan within 2 years after surgery. The use rate steadily increased over time. Themajority of PET scans had been per-formedwithin 2 monthsafter surgery. Amongpatientswhohadunder-gone a PET scan, 3, 644 (57. 6 %) had also undergone preoperative imaging, and 1, 977 (54. 3 %) of these patients had undergone reimag-ingwithPETwithin 2 monthsafter surgery. <b>Marriage,</b> <b>year</b> of diagnosis, tumor stage, preoperative imaging, postoperative visit to a medical oncologist, and adjuvant chemotherapy {{were significantly associated with}} increased PET use. Conclusion: PET use after colon cancer resection is steadily increasing, and further study is needed to understand the clinical value and effectiveness of PET scans and the reasons for this departure from guideline-concordant care...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Manganese is {{a common}} natural {{contaminant}} of groundwater in Bangladesh. In this cross-sectional study we assessed the association between water manganese and all-cause infant mortality in the offspring of female participants in the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study Cohort. METHODS: In 2001, drinking water samples were collected, a history of well use was obtained, {{and a history of}} birth outcomes was ascertained. To avoid misclassification of exposure, women were included only if they had been drinking from the same well for most of their childbearing years (marriage years – well years ≤ 2). Of a total of 26, 002 births (among 6, 537 mothers), 3, 837 children were born to women with this profile. The current analysis was based on the portion of these infants (n = 3, 824) with recorded exposure and outcome status, 335 of whom died before reaching 1 year of age. RESULTS: Infants exposed to water manganese {{greater than or equal to}} the 2003 World Health Organization standard of 0. 4 mg/L had an elevated mortality risk during the first year of life compared with unexposed infants [odds ratio (OR) = 1. 8; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 2 – 2. 6]. Adjustment for water arsenic, indicators of social class, and other variables did not appreciably alter these results. When the population was restricted to infants born to recently married parents (<b>marriage</b> <b>year</b> 1991 or after), this elevation was more pronounced (OR = 3. 4; 95 % CI, 1. 5 – 7. 9). CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings indicate a possible association between manganese exposure and infant mortality. However, given the methodologic limitations of this study, the association needs to be confirmed through future work...|$|E
