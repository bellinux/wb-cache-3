5|$|Despite debuting with {{moderate}} viewing figures, {{the departure of}} Carell affected the show's ratings, which fell as the season progressed. The season ranked as the eighty-seventh most watched television series during the 2011–12 television year and saw a dramatic decrease in ratings from the previous season. Critical reception was polarized. Many critics argued that the series should have ended after the departure of Carell; many also felt that the season recycled storylines from past episodes. Other critics were <b>more</b> <b>positive,</b> complimenting various actors and their characters. It {{marked the first time}} since season one that the show did not receive any Emmy nominations.|$|E

5|$|Eveline was an {{inspiration}} for many of Balzac's characters. She {{can be seen as}} the model for La Fosseue, Mme Claes, Modesta Mignon, Ursule Mirouet, Adelina Houlot, and especially Eugenie Grandet and Mme de Mortsauf. There is less agreement among scholars on whether she was also the inspiration for more negative characters such as Fedora and lady Dudley, as Balzac seems to have used her mostly as a model for <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> personas. His works also mention numerous characters named Eve or Eveline, and have several dedications to her.|$|E

40|$|SETTING: Mawenzi Regional Hospital, {{northern}} Tanzania. OBJECTIVE: To {{determine the}} value of light-emitting diode (LED) microscopy in diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) on bleach-treated and direct sputum smears. DESIGN: Sputum samples were collected from patients suspected of pulmonary TB who presented consecutively at the laboratory for smear evaluation between December 2009 and February 2010. Four smears were prepared from each specimen: conventional Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN), direct auramine, bleach centrifugation and bleach short sedimentation auramine smears. A light microscope {{was used to examine}} ZN smears and an LED fluorescent microscope to examine auramine-stained smears. RESULTS: Of the 267 sputum samples examined, respectively 78 (29 %), 62 (23 %), 74 (28 %) and 48 (18 %) were acid-fast bacilli (AFB) positive by the bleach centrifugation, bleach short sedimentation, direct auramine and ZN methods. Bleach centrifugation identified 30 (11 %) <b>more</b> <b>positives</b> than ZN microscopy (P < 0. 001), but was not superior to the direct auramine method (P = 0. 46), which yielded 26 (10 %) <b>more</b> <b>positives</b> than ZN microscopy (P < 0. 001). Fluorescent LED required a shorter smear reading time (1. 5 min on average), while the light microscope took 4 min (P < 0. 001). CONCLUSION: Fluorescent LED microscopy with direct smear preparation is rapid and effective. Further studies are needed to ascertain its performance under routine conditions...|$|R
50|$|Because {{the test}} is two-sided, a result as extreme or more extreme than 8 {{positive}} differences includes the results of 8, 9, or 10 positive differences, {{and the results of}} 0, 1, or 2 positive differences. The probability of 8 or <b>more</b> <b>positives</b> among 10 deer or 2 or fewer positives among 10 deer {{is the same as the}} probability of 8 or more heads or 2 or fewer heads in 10 flips of a fair coin. The probabilities can be calculated using the binomial test, with the probability of heads = probability of tails = 0.5.|$|R
5|$|Fightstar are a British post-hardcore {{band from}} London, England that formed in 2003. The band is {{composed}} of lead vocalist, guitarist and keyboardist Charlie Simpson, guitarist and co-vocalist Alex Westaway, bassist Dan Haigh and drummer Omar Abidi. Fightstar are known to incorporate metal, alternative rock, emo and other genres into their general post-hardcore sound. During the band's early days, they were viewed sceptically by critics because of Simpson's former pop career with Busted. Their live shows got a <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> reaction, and their 2005 debut EP, They Liked You Better When You Were Dead, was a critical success.|$|E
5|$|Historian Wilhelm Levison, {{writing in}} 1946, was sceptical about the {{authenticity}} of this charter. In particular, {{he felt that the}} two separate addresses were incongruous and suggested that the first address, occurring before the preamble, may have been inserted by someone familiar with Bede to echo Eadbald's future conversion (see below). A more recent and <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> appraisal by John Morris argues that the charter and its witness list are authentic because it incorporates titles and phraseology that had fallen out of use by 800.|$|E

Others, which include critics Michael Andrews and Peter Davis, have seen Connotations as proof of Copland's continued growth and inventiveness as a composer while not downplaying the work's melodic and harmonic harshness and potential difficulty overall for listeners.|$|E

The greatest enthusiasm was for Rachel's fathers, though Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) was complimented on his brief scenes, and the scene with Kurt (Chris Colfer) and Karofsky (Max Adler) was also praised. The episode was also significant because it featured an on-screen kiss by Santana (Naya Rivera) and Brittany (Heather Morris), which was the show's first lesbian kiss.|$|E
