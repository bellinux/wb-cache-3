5|$|Narcosis {{results from}} {{breathing}} gases under elevated pressure, {{and may be}} classified by the principal gas involved. The noble gases, except helium and probably neon, as well as nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen cause a decrement in mental function, but their effect on psychomotor function (processes affecting the coordination of sensory or cognitive processes and <b>motor</b> <b>activity)</b> varies widely. The effects of carbon dioxide consistently result in a diminution of mental and psychomotor function. The noble gases argon, krypton, and xenon are more narcotic than nitrogen at a given pressure, and xenon has so much anesthetic activity {{that it is a}} usable anesthetic at 80% concentration and normal atmospheric pressure. Xenon has historically been too expensive to be used very much in practice, but it has been successfully used for surgical operations, and xenon anesthesia systems are still being proposed and designed.|$|E
5|$|The strongest {{clues to}} the {{function}} of the cerebellum have come from examining the consequences of damage to it. Animals and humans with cerebellar dysfunction show, above all, problems with motor control, {{on the same side of}} the body as the damaged part of the cerebellum. They continue to be able to generate <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> but lose precision, producing erratic, uncoordinated, or incorrectly timed movements. A standard test of cerebellar function is to reach with the tip of the finger for a target at arm's length: A healthy person will move the fingertip in a rapid straight trajectory, whereas a person with cerebellar damage will reach slowly and erratically, with many mid-course corrections. Deficits in non-motor functions are more difficult to detect. Thus, the general conclusion reached decades ago is that the basic function of the cerebellum is to calibrate the detailed form of a movement, not to initiate movements or to decide which movements to execute.|$|E

Pretreatment of rats with the opioid antagonist naltrexone (450 μg/kg, s. c.) completely blocked the ‘normalizing’ effects of ORG 2766, implicating endogenous opioids in this action of ORG 2766.

The fact that {{birds and mammals}} are the only known animals to exhibit REM and NREM sleep indicates a common trait before divergence. Reptiles are therefore the most logical group to investigate the origins of sleep. Daytime activity in reptiles alternates between basking and short bouts of active behavior, which has significant neurological and physiological similarities to sleep states in mammals. It is proposed that REM sleep evolved from short bouts of <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> in reptiles while SWS evolved from their basking state which shows similar slow wave EEG patterns.|$|E

Use of MDMA individually or in a small groups in a quiet environment and when concentrating, is associated with increased lucidity, capability of concentration, sensitivity of aesthetic aspects of the background and emotions, as well as greater capability of communication with others. In psychotherapeutic settings MDMA effects have been described by infantile ideas, alternating phases of mood, sometimes memories and moods connected with childhood experiences.|$|E

40|$|The {{preschool}} {{period is}} a time of relatively quick and different changes at all areas of the development at the same time. Understanding of the development is therefore crucial for proper planning of activities in the kindergarten, which also includes additional professional assistance for children with special needs. In the first year of life, the motor development is in forefront due to learning on a concrete experiential level. Through motion, the child can research his body and the world around him and so for the first time gain optimal concrete experiences, which enable him to acquire knowledge and create new brain connections. With thoughtfully and carefully planned physical activity in the kindergarten (or at home) we can have an important positive impact on the quality and speed of the child’s integrated development. In children with special needs, which are already in the earliest period facing problems that significantly slow down their development, learning through concrete experiences, playing and motion, is even more important. The purpose of the thesis was to analyse the importance of selected material, substantive and personnel factors for the execution of <b>motor</b> <b>activities</b> in additional professional assistance classes in regular kindergarten departments. The results showed that there are no statistically significant connections between additional education from the field of motion and the quantity of the planned <b>motor</b> <b>activities</b> in additional professional assistance classes. Precisely the quantity of the planned <b>motor</b> <b>activities</b> does not depend on special factors. Half of the questioned providers of additional professional assistance devote more than a half of their time for <b>motor</b> <b>activities</b> and {{the other half of the}} questioned devote less than half of the joint time for assistance to children with special needs.

This phenomenon is different from other classes of objects, and indicates that tools are not viewed just based off what they are, but also what they actually do. In just viewing tools, activation of left lateralized areas {{are very similar to}} the use/pantomiming areas as noted above. These areas include the ventral premotor cortex, left inferior frontal gyrus and some parietal areas. The main difference is that tools being used elicit greater activation in ventral brain regions, and decreased activation in primary motor areas. Additionally, there were very similar areas of activation in naming tools and viewing tools. There were other areas of activation in the left hemisphere, possibly reflecting the lateralization of language.|$|E
500|$|The {{cerebellum}} (Latin for [...] "little brain") is a {{major feature}} of the hindbrain of all vertebrates. [...] Although usually smaller than the cerebrum, in some animals such as the mormyrid fishes it may be as large as or even larger. In humans, the cerebellum {{plays an important role}} in motor control, and it may also be involved in some cognitive functions such as attention and language as well as in regulating fear and pleasure responses, but its movement-related functions are the most solidly established. The human cerebellum does not initiate movement, but contributes to coordination, precision, and accurate timing: it receives input from sensory systems of the spinal cord and from other parts of the brain, and integrates these inputs to fine-tune <b>motor</b> <b>activity.</b> Cerebellar damage produces disorders in fine movement, equilibrium, posture, and motor learning in humans.|$|E
500|$|Dopamine {{contributes}} to the action selection process {{in at least two}} important ways. First, it sets the [...] "threshold" [...] for initiating actions. The higher the level of dopamine activity, the lower the impetus required to evoke a given behavior. As a consequence, high levels of dopamine lead to high levels of <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> and impulsive behavior; low levels of dopamine lead to torpor and slowed reactions. Parkinson's disease, in which dopamine levels in the substantia nigra circuit are greatly reduced, is characterized by stiffness and difficulty initiating movement—however, when people with the disease are confronted with strong stimuli such as a serious threat, their reactions can be as vigorous as those of a healthy person. In the opposite direction, drugs that increase dopamine release, such as cocaine or amphetamine, can produce heightened levels of activity, including at the extreme, psychomotor agitation and stereotyped movements.|$|E

500|$|A {{particular}} {{conceptual model}} of the motor circuit and its alteration with PD has been of great influence since 1980, although some limitations have been pointed out which have led to modifications. In this model, the basal ganglia normally exert a constant inhibitory influence {{on a wide range}} of motor systems, preventing them from becoming active at inappropriate times. When a decision is made to perform a particular action, inhibition is reduced for the required motor system, thereby releasing it for activation. Dopamine acts to facilitate this release of inhibition, so high levels of dopamine function tend to promote <b>motor</b> <b>activity,</b> while low levels of dopamine function, such as occur in PD, demand greater exertions of effort for any given movement. Thus, the net effect of dopamine depletion is to produce hypokinesia, an overall reduction in motor output. [...] Drugs that are used to treat PD, conversely, may produce excessive dopamine activity, allowing motor systems to be activated at inappropriate times and thereby producing dyskinesias.|$|E

His recovery spanned twelve months, which he spent away from his family at Liverpool's Myrtle Street children's hospital. Upon his discharge in May 1948, his mother allowed him to stay home, causing him to miss school. At age eight, he remained illiterate, with a poor grasp of mathematics. His lack of education contributed to a feeling of alienation at school, which resulted in his regularly playing truant at Sefton Park. After several years of twice-weekly tutoring from his surrogate sister and neighbour, Marie Maguire Crawford, Starkey had nearly caught up to his peers academically, but in 1953, he contracted tuberculosis and was admitted to a sanatorium, where he remained for two years. During his stay the medical staff {{made an effort to}} stimulate <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> and relieve boredom by encouraging their patients to join the hospital band, leading to his first exposure to a percussion instrument: a makeshift mallet made from a cotton bobbin that he used to strike the cabinets next to his bed.
