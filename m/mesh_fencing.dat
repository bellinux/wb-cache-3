25|$|Between May 13–14, 2004 {{the site}} was {{enclosed}} with temporary <b>mesh</b> <b>fencing</b> and plain-clothed security guards commenced patrols of the public areas. At 02:00 on May 15 bulldozers arrived at the site and tree-felling began at 07:00. The work caused immediate concern to nearby residents who feared the work might unsettle asbestos deposits in the ground. Residents formed the Save Spodden Valley action group the following week. Residents also protested to Rochdale Council, which subsequently issued an emergency tree preservation order on six parts of the site, preventing the removal of trees without permission of planning officers, and carrying a fine of up to £20,000 per tree. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) also secured a voluntary arrangement to halt any work that could disturb soil on the site pending soil sampling. Former Turner's employees and local residents claimed that, {{as recently as the}} 1960s, asbestos dust and fibres were clearly visible hanging from the trees, and that a disused coalmine shaft exposed by the tree felling had been used over a period of decades to dump hundreds of tonnes of asbestos waste.|$|E
2500|$|Woven {{mesh wire}} is safer but more {{expensive}} than strands of smooth wire. [...] It {{is more difficult to}} install, and has some visibility issues, but horses are less likely to become tangled in it or be injured if they run into it. [...] Adding a top rail of wood or synthetic material increases visibility of the fence and prevents it from being bent by horses reaching over it. [...] A strand of electric fence may also keep horses from pushing on a mesh fence. [...] <b>Mesh</b> <b>fencing</b> needs to be heavy-gauge wire, woven, not welded, and the squares of the mesh should be too small for a horse to put a foot through. [...] "Field fence" [...] or [...] "no-climb" [...] fence are safer designs than more widely woven [...] "sheep fence." [...] Chain link fence is occasionally seen, but horses can bend chain link almost as easily as a thinner-gauge wire, so the additional expense is often not justified by any gain over good-quality woven wire.|$|E

40|$|Conventional fencing methods V-mesh wire, {{square mesh}} wire and wood panels are {{compared}} to experimental methods - 15 wire hightensile wire fences; electric high-tensile wire fences of three designs; baited electric fences; hog panel fences; plastic <b>mesh</b> <b>fences</b> and visqueen wrapped haystacks. Total cost of materials, cost per ft. /yr. and comments concerning estimates of efficacy are discussed. The V-mesh wire, hog panel and plastic <b>mesh</b> <b>fences</b> {{all have a}} very high cost per ft. and cost per ft. /yr. rating and should probably not be used. High-tensile and square <b>mesh</b> wire <b>fences</b> are effective and cheaper alternatives. Modern high-tensile wire electric fences can be an effective alternatives in some situations. Results from tests using visqueen wrapped haystacks and baited electric fences are encouraging and more experimentation is needed.

50|$|The {{lower level}} of the kiosk structure, the main public eating area, leads out via a terrace to the north onto part of the {{escarpment}} walking track system immediately below the primary viewing precinct. At this point the path is fenced from the escarpment with chain-wire <b>mesh</b> <b>fencing</b> fixed to galvanized pipe posts and rails. Remnants of exotic vegetation, particularly of Bougainvillea creeper to the bank, are identified here. Walking northward along this track similar but more intimate vistas to the north are obtained to those from the primary viewing precinct above.|$|E
5000|$|The top of {{the wall}} was lined with a smooth pipe, {{intended}} to {{make it more difficult to}} scale.

50|$|Construction progressed {{at a rate}} of {{six feet}} per day. The top of this tower was capped with a two storey {{observation}} deck capable of holding 1,500 people at a time. The tower was completed in June 1964. Price of admission to the observation deck was $1 per adult and 25¢ per child. Two glass-enclosed elevators {{at the center of this}} tower were capable of carrying 1,800 people per hour. The fifty second long elevator ride would take passengers 278 feet to the lower observation level. From this lower deck, people could walk up to the top observation deck located ten feet above. The upper deck was a partially open, providing people with excellent views of the Falls through special openings in the wire <b>mesh</b> <b>fencing</b> and to provide for the taking of pictures.|$|E
50|$|The {{impact of}} Cyclone Althea in 1972 {{provided}} {{the impetus for}} a major expansion and modification program to cater for changing Showground requirements. Every building sustained damage. Those that incorporated cyclone bracing survived relatively intact - such as the current Poultry Shed and Heatley Hall; others - such as the betting shed, caretaker's cottage, pig pavilion and Keiry Hall - were severely damaged or collapsed such as the Drill Hall (known as the Garbutt Hall). The show ring track was extended to its current elliptical shape to better cater for racing interests such as harness racing and motor cycle and bicycle races, and an officials' box was constructed to oversee the greyhound racing. The ring was enclosed by a new fence constructed of concrete block with cyclone <b>mesh</b> <b>fencing.</b> The fence, incorporated a decorative triangular pattern which was also used in the upgrade {{to one of the}} oldest Exhibition pavilions adjoining the Heatley Hall.|$|E

40|$|Fog {{moisture}} on Santa Rosa Island {{plays an}} integral role in its ecosystems. It {{is important to}} understand how fog patterns could potentially effect the flora and fauna. I hypothesized that north facing side of the ridge will have more potential fog moisture due to the predominant wind direction coming from the north. This study used Fog capturing Screens to determine relative amount of fog on the north and south sides of the main ridge of the island. Three locations along the ridge had two Fog Screens placed on the north and south side of the ridge at similar elevations. Fog Screens are 12 gauge 1 ” by 1 ” wire <b>mesh</b> <b>fencing</b> with 40 % shade cloth attached to the <b>mesh</b> <b>fencing.</b> Each Fog Screen is 1 meter long by 0. 5 meter high supported a wooden and metal structure. The amount of moisture collected by a Fog Screen was recorded by a HOBO Rain Gauge Data Logger #RG 3 -M. I found that more moisture was collected on the north facing slopes of the ridge compared to the south facing slopes, supporting my hypothesis. With more moisture on the north facing slope, there is more potential to see wetter local conditions for plants and animals...|$|E
40|$|During October 1969 a {{piece of}} land was fenced out of the Kruger National Park, Republic of South Africa, near Numbi Gate in the south western tip of the Park.

40|$|Our {{objectives}} were {{to evaluate the}} seed yield of soybean, and Duncan 2 ̆ 7 s model with respect to relationship between seed yield and plant population, and analyze the response of soybean seed yield components to light enrichment initiated at different growth stages. Duncan coined the term crowding to include the effects of density and planting pattern. Duncan 2 ̆ 7 s model states {{that there is a}} linear relationship between natural logarithm of yield plant− 1 and crowding. Results of the studies fitting Duncan 2 ̆ 7 s model to the data obtained from different soybean cultivars planted at different densities and planting patterns indicated that the model can predict the changes in yield with changing densities and planting pattern especially if the variability in the data is low. ^ In order to analyze the response of soybean seed yield components to non-destructive light enrichment initiated at different growth stages, light enrichment was imposed on the indeterminate soybean cultivar Evans by installing wire <b>mesh</b> <b>fencing</b> {{on either side of the}} center row to push the adjacent rows aside at different growth stages. Fences prevented plants in the neighboring rows from encroaching on the growing space of the center row plants. Pod number per plant and to a lesser extent seed size accounted for variation in seed yield. Light enrichment initiated at late vegetative or early flowering stages increased seed yield 217...|$|E
