5000|$|Advocate General Jääskinen made {{frequent}} {{reference in}} his Opinion {{to the fact}} that the Data Protection Directive predates the Google era (it dates from 1995 and is due to be replaced in late 2014 by the General Data Protection Regulation). On the first set of questions the Advocate General found that Google's business model brought Google Inc. and Google Spain within the scope of the Directive. On the second set of questions concerning the <b>material</b> <b>scope</b> of the Directive, the Advocate General held that Google could not be regarded as a data controller: Google's search activities involves the processing of personal data, but Google does not thereby become a data controller for the content of the material when the processing is carried out in a haphazard, indiscriminate and random manner. In the Advocate General's view the sense of the Directive is that [...] "the controller is aware of the existence of a certain defined category of information amounting to personal data and the controller processes this data with some intention which relates to their processing as personal data".|$|E

40|$|The article {{looks at}} {{the impact of the}} {{introduction}} of Union citizenship on the scope of application of the Treaty. In particular it considers how the citizenship provisions have affected the personal and the <b>material</b> <b>scope</b> of the Treaty. By virtue of Article 17 EC the personal scope of the Treaty is expanded so that any Union citizen, and not only the migrant citizen, now falls within the personal scope of the Treaty. The significance of this finding then depends on the definition of the <b>material</b> <b>scope</b> of the Treaty, i. e. on the identification of the rights that Union citizens can claim qua citizens. In this respect, it is clear that Union citizens have a right to move; and a right to reside in any of the Member States (subject to limitations and conditions). Union citizens have also a right to equal treatment deriving from Article 12 EC. In this respect, the article argues that such a right to equal treatment is not merely an ancillary right which is conditional upon migration; rather, Article 12 EC is a self-standing right pertaining to all those who fall within the personal scope of the Treaty. As a result, Article 12 EC is capable of being invoked by static union citizens to challenge reverse discrimination...|$|E

When the <b>material</b> <b>scope</b> does cover health or other benefits, the coverage is often limited (Spiegel 2010).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Simulation-based {{interventions}} and education can potentially contribute to {{safer and more}} effective systems of care. We utilized in-situ simulation to highlight safety issues, regulatory requirements, and assess perceptions of safety processes by the plastic surgery office staff. METHODS: A high-fidelity human patient simulator was brought to an office-based plastic surgery setting to enact a half-day full-scale, multidisciplinary medical emergency. Facilitated group debriefings were conducted after each scenario with special consideration {{of the principles of}} team training, communication, crisis management, and adherence to evidence-based protocols and regulatory standards. Abbreviated AHRQ Medical Office Safety Culture Survey was completed by the participants before and after the session. RESULTS: The in-situ simulations had a high degree of acceptance and face validity according to the participants. Areas highlighted by the simulation sessions included rapid communication, delegation of tasks, location of emergency <b>materials,</b> <b>scope</b> of practice, and logistics of transport. The participant survey indicated greater awareness of patient safety issues following participation in simulation and debriefing exercises in 3 areas (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) : the need to change processes if there is a recognized patient safety issue (100...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, two {{measures}} against racial discrimination {{have been taken}} in Europe: the European Union adopted a Council Directive implementing the Principle of Equal Treatment between Persons irrespective of Racial or Ethnic Origin in June 2000; and, in December 2002, the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, a body of the Council of Europe, adopted General Policy Recommendation no 7 on National Legislation to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination. This article reviews these two instruments, which show many similarities, but also some differences.

The relationship between the two, and how they influence and strengthen one another to increase the pressure for adequate and effective legislation within the Member States of the European Union, is discussed and analysed...|$|E
40|$|Big data is {{the present}} and the future. It holds the {{potential}} to make corporations create big revenues, to let scientists solve vital issues and to help governments make informed policy decisions. Yet the massive collection and use of personal data also raises a host of issues, particularly for individuals’ privacy and data protection rights. In Europe, data protection regulation is widely regarded as the answer to these issues. Through regulating data flows and providing individuals control over their personal data, some of big data’s possible undesired effects may be prevented. Yet upon closer scrutiny, it is uncertain whether European data protection legislation suffices to address these negative consequences. The practices in big data projects and the threshold for data to fall within the <b>material</b> <b>scope</b> of EU data protection legislation raise doubts about data protection’s applicability to big data...|$|E
