5000|$|Maps {{are defined}} by the [...] {{interface}} in Java. Maps are simple data structures that associate a key with an element. This lets the <b>map</b> <b>be</b> very flexible. If the key is the hash code of the element, the map is essentially a set. If it's just an increasing number, it becomes a list. Maps are implemented by , , and [...] HashMap uses a hash table. The hashes of the keys are used to find the elements in various buckets. LinkedHashMap extends this by creating a doubly linked list between the elements, allowing them to be accessed in {{the order in which}} they were inserted into the map. TreeMap, in contrast to HashMap and LinkedHashMap, uses a red-black tree. The keys are used as the values for the nodes in the tree, and the nodes point to the elements in the map.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of maps f : U → C defined on an open subset U of the complex plane C, some authors (e.g., Freitag 2009, Definition IV.4.1) define a {{conformal}} map to be an injective map with nonzero derivative i.e., f’(z)≠ 0 for every z in U. According to this definition, a map f : U → C is conformal {{if and only if}} f: U → f(U) is biholomorphic. Other authors (e.g., Conway 1978) define a conformal map as one with nonzero derivative, without requiring that the <b>map</b> <b>be</b> injective. According to this weaker definition of conformality, a conformal map need not be biholomorphic even though it is locally biholomorphic. For example, if f: U → U is defined by f(z) = z2 with U = C-{0}, then f is conformal on U, since its derivative f’(z) = 2z ≠ 0, but it is not biholomorphic, since it is 2-1.|$|E
5000|$|The inventions of {{philosophy}} {{are no less}} fantastic than those of art: Josiah Royce, in {{the first volume of}} his work The World and the Individual (1899), has formulated the following: 'Let us imagine that a portion of the soil of England has been levelled off perfectly and that on it a cartographer traces a map of England. The job is perfect; there is no detail of the soil of England, no matter how minute, that is not registered on the map; everything has there its correspondence. This map, in such a case, should contain a map of the map, which should contain a map of the map of the map, and so on to infinity.'
