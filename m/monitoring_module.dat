50|$|The {{maintenance}} cost and losses in productivity with unplanned downtime for machine tool components such as spindle bearings and ball screws {{could be reduced}} if one could proactively take action prior to failure. In addition, cutting tools and inserts are expensive to replace when they are still in good condition, but replacing the tools too late can be costly due to scrap and re-work. The proposed health monitoring application will use MTConnect to extract controller data and pattern recognition algorithms to assess the health condition of the spindle and machine tool axes. The health assessment approach is based on running a routine program each shift in which the most recent data patterns are compared to the baseline data patterns. An online tool condition <b>monitoring</b> <b>module</b> is also proposed and uses controller data such as the spindle motor current, with other add on sensors (vibration, acoustic emission) to accurately estimate and predict tool wear. With the added transparency of the machine tool health information, one can take proactive actions before significant downtime or productivity losses occur. For the manufacturing industry, MTConnect perfectly fits in the architecture of cyber-physical systems (CPS) for manufacturing. The 5 level architecture offers a framework to adopt all functionalities of CPS. Data acquisition and communication technologies such as MTConnect would be categorized into the smart connection level of CPS.|$|E

A PVDF pressure sensor (response time <[*] 1  ms, response point <[*] 200  g, range 0 – 50  kg) was arranged on the slot-wheeled seedling storage tray and used to detect whether there is a potted vegetable seedling tray waiting to be delivered. According to the change of the pressure signal, the controller directs the motor to drive the sprocket wheel of the storage plate and carries out the transfer of the seedling plate. By setting a stroke switch on the sprocket conveyor belt, the position of the seedling tray conveying is detected, and the push rod mechanism is triggered to perform the pushing action, and the seedling tray is moved from the seedling storage mechanism to the seedling tray conveyor belt. A finite position sensor is arranged at the junction between the conveyor belt of the seedling tray and the push rod mechanism. When it is detected that the seedling tray enters the conveyor belt from the storage mechanism, the signal is sent to the controller to stop the pushing action. The stability of the conveying action is ensured. The abnormal extraction of seedling was obtained by detecting the pressure change of the seedling pushing mechanism by pressure sensor. The potted vegetable seedling is taken out from the seedling tray and conveyed to the conveying mechanism. The CCD camera is arranged above the conveying track of the cup to monitor the leakage and load status of the potted vegetable seedling in the cups and to obtain the conveying information.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Monitoring {{a process}} and its file I/O {{behaviors}} {{is important for}} security inspection for a data center server against intrusions, malware infection and information leakage. In {{the case of the}} Linux kernel 2. 6, a set of hook functions called the Linux Security Module (LSM) has been implemented in order to monitor and control the system calls. By using the LSM we can inspect the activity of unknown malicious processes. However, a sophisticated attacker could breach the kernel configurations using the rootkits. Furthermore since the monitoring results of the malicious process activity are stored as a file on Hard Disk Drive (HDD), it will be easily manipulated by the attacker. In this paper, we propose a secure monitoring scheme that addresses the attacks against the <b>monitoring</b> <b>module</b> and its result for security inspection of the data center server. The <b>monitoring</b> <b>module</b> is implemented as a LSM-based function and protected by the kernel protection technique. The integrity of the monitoring result is guaranteed by using a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) of the Linux kernel and a mechanism of the trusted process invocation. This mechanism can serve as an infrastrucuture of secure inspection platform for data center server because the integrity of the <b>monitoring</b> <b>module</b> and its result is guaranteed.

40|$|Run-time {{verification}} is {{a technique}} to reason about a program correctness. Given a set of desirable properties and a program trace from the inspected program as an input, the <b>monitor</b> <b>module</b> verifies that properties hold on this trace. As this process is taking place at a run time, {{one of the major}} drawbacks of run-time verification is the execution overhead caused by a monitoring activity. In this thesis, we intend to minimize this overhead by presenting a collection of parallel verification algorithms. The algorithms verify properties correctness in a parallel fashion, decreasing the verification time by dispersion of computationally intensive calculations over multiple cores (first level of parallelism). We designed the algorithms with the intention to exploit a data-level parallelism, thus specifically suitable to run on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), although can be utilized on multi-core platforms as well. Running the inspected program and the <b>monitor</b> <b>module</b> on separate platforms (second level of parallelism) results in several advantages: minimization of interference between the monitor and the program, faster processing for non-trivial computations, and even significant reduction in power consumption (when the monitor is running on GPU). This work also aims to provide a solution to automated run-time verification of C programs by implementing the aforementioned set of algorithms in the monitoring tool called GPU-based online and offline Monitoring Framework (GooMF). The ultimate goal of GooMF is to supply developers with an easy-to-use and flexible verification API that requires minimal knowledge of formal languages and techniques...|$|R
