2500|$|During the interwar period, Emil Isac {{published}} {{several new}} volumes {{of poetry and}} prose, beginning with Poeme în proză ("Prose Poems", Oradea, 1923), and followed by two books of articles and essays, both printed in 1925 {{under the auspices of}} the Arad Diocese: Cartea unui om ("A Man's Book") and Notiţele mele ("My Little Notes"). The writer also issued a print version of Maica cea tânără (Cluj, 1931), and two volumes of collected poems, published in 1936 by, respectively, Cartea Românească publishing house and the eponymous publishing company of Adevărul newspaper. These various works kept Isac in the focus of critical attention. Reviews were notably written by: Ovid Densusianu, Claudia Millian and Camil Petrescu (Poeme în proză); Romulus Dianu and Perpessicius (Cartea unui om, Notiţele mele); Tudor Bugnariu, Alexandru Al. Philippide and Eugeniu Sperantia (the other poetry volumes). In 1928, Isac was also interviewed by short story author I. Valerian, their dialogues seeing print in Viaţa Literară magazine, with the general title Un precursor al poeziei moderniste. De vorbă cu d. Emil Isac ("A Precursor of Modernist Poetry. In Conversation with <b>Mr.</b> <b>Emil</b> Isac"). Five years later, the same venue hosted Isac's conversation with cultural journalist Octavian Şireagu: Cu d. Emil Isac despre critici şi modernişti ("With <b>Mr.</b> <b>Emil</b> Isac on Critics and Modernists"). Several other such interviews followed, including a 1936 Adevărul piece where he was engaged by George Macovescu, the leftist activist, in a conversation about [...] "poetry, theater [...] peace". Isac's own leftist views led him to contribute articles for the pro-socialist newspaper Cuvântul Liber.|$|R

In 1882, during {{the preparation of the}} work, von Mueller named Eucalyptus todtiana (Coastal Blackbutt) in honour of Todt, stating [...] "... this species bears the name of <b>Mr</b> <b>Emil</b> Todt, whose artistic talent became devoted only to illustrating plants at a venerable age, when most of those engaged in such pursuits, have ceased to work professionally.

A fight then ensues with the lights out, and the Stooges ultimately get the baddies.|$|R
40|$|The {{bacterial}} {{level of}} the water, sediment and cultured shrimp (Penaeus monodon) from different ponds were determined using a general medium, a presumptive Vibrio medium and a presumptive Pseudomonasâ€“Aeromonas medium. Samples were taken from ponds that had not used any antimicrobial, ponds that had previously used and also ponds that were currently using oxolinic acid (OXA). The bacterial level in the sediment was {{higher than in the}} water using all three media. More bacteria existed in the pond system than in the receiving environment. Shrimp hepatopancreas harbored more bacteria than the lymphoid organ. The Vibrio density of the pond and bacterial levels in the shrimp were correlated {{with the use of the}} antimicrobial. The Vibrio {{level of the}} pond samples and microbial density of shrimps were higher from ponds that had not used any antimicrobials. The percentage recoveries of resistance to oxytetracycline (OTC) and OXA in bacteria from shrimp ponds and cultured shrimps were also determined using Zobell's marine agar, Pseudomonasâ€“Aeromonas selective agar and thiosulfate citrate bile sucrose agar (TCBS) with the addition of either 25 Î¼g/ml OTC or 25 Î¼g/ml OXA. Presumptive Vibrio bacteria and other bacterial taxa recovered from the pond/receiving water/sediment from all three sites showed some degree of resistance to OTC and OXA. However, a higher percentage recovery of strains resistant to OTC than to OXA was observed among the presumptive vibrios and other bacterial taxa. Pseudomonas and Aeromonas bacteria were more resistant to OXA compared with the vibrios. All bacterial taxa resistant to OTC were more readily recovered from the water samples than from the sediment samples. In general, between the samples from the pond and from the receiving environment, a higher percentage of resistant strains was observed in the latter. Higher percentage recovery of bacteria resistant to OXA was observed in shrimp from ponds currently using OXA than those from ponds that had not used any or those that had previously used them. The results of the present study showed that the percentage recovery of resistance reflected the pattern of antimicrobial use.

5000|$|The overall {{concept of}} the series was that each week The Stooges would try a {{different}} job or trade to see if eventually they might succeed; the comedy would ensue as each career they tried would eventually turn into a fiasco. In the pilot they try their hand as interior decorators. In their office, they meet a new client, <b>Mr.</b> Pennyfeather (<b>Emil</b> Sitka). Just a few moments after Pennyfeather arrives, Shemp accidentally spills ink {{down the front of}} Pennyfeather's suit, who becomes enraged. The Stooges then challenge Pennyfeather to mischief with them, featuring the famous [...] "Texas" [...] routine. After the some slapstick mayhem, they are successful in tossing Mr. Pennyfeather out of the office. Suddenly, the next client calls him on the phone for them to come in to manage her house. In her house, The Stooges not only hang wallpaper, but also manage to trash their client's home. Unfortunately, that woman is Mrs. Pennyfeather (Symona Boniface) and that house is Mr. Pennyfeather's house. After Mr. Pennyfeather comes home, the Stooges cover Mr. Pennyfeather with wallpaper and both Mr. Pennyfeather and the Stooges recognize each other (after Pennyfeather imitates the [...] "Texas" [...] routine done for him earlier by the Stooges). In a rage, as the trio attempts to sneak out of the house, both Pennyfeathers attack the boys with their own paint and utensils; the Pennyfeathers also snipe at each other for hiring them.|$|R
