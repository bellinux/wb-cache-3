The addition of a center notch makes it easier to cut the insulation without cutting the wire. This type of wire stripper is used by rotating it around the insulation while applying pressure {{in order to make a}} cut around the insulation. since the insulation is not bonded to the wire, it then pulls easily off the end. This type of wire stripper can be used on wires of any size. Another type of <b>manual</b> <b>wire</b> stripper is very similar to the simple design previously mentioned, except this type has several notches of varying size. This allows the user to match the notch size to the wire size, thereby eliminating the need for twisting, but can only be used on wire sizes that approximately match one of the notches. Once the device is clamped on, the remainder of the wire can simply be pulled out, leaving the insulation behind.|$|R

40|$|The use of {{underfill}} {{materials is}} necessary with flip-chip interconnect technology to redistribute stresses due to mismatching coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) between dissimilar {{materials in the}} overall assembly. Underfills are formulated using organic polymers and possibly inorganic filler materials. There are a few ways to apply the underfills with flip-chip technology. Traditional capillary-flow underfill materials now possess high flow speed and reduced time to cure, but they still require additional processing steps beyond the typical surface-mount technology (SMT) assembly process. Studies were conducted using underfills in a temperature range of - 190 to 85 C, which resulted in an increase of reliability by one to two orders of magnitude. Thermal shock of the flip-chip test articles was designed to induce failures at the interconnect sites (- 40 to 100 C). The study on the reliability of flip chips using underfills in the extreme temperature region is of significant value for space applications. This technology is considered as an enabling technology for future space missions. Flip-chip interconnect technology is an advanced electrical interconnection approach where the silicon die or chip is electrically connected, face down, to the substrate by reflowing solder bumps on area-array metallized terminals on the die to matching footprints of solder-wettable pads on the chosen substrate. This advanced flip-chip interconnect technology will significantly improve the performance of high-speed systems, productivity enhancement over <b>manual</b> <b>wire</b> bonding, self-alignment during die joining, low lead inductances, and reduced need for attachment of precious metals. The use of commercially developed no-flow fluxing underfills provides a means of reducing the processing steps employed in the traditional capillary flow methods to enhance SMT compatibility. Reliability of flip chips may be significantly increased by matching/tailoring the CTEs of the substrate material and the silicon die or chip, and also the underfill materials.

The eventual goal of each process step and the entire process is to produce components with 100 percent interconnect and satisfy the reliability requirements.

Finally, reconfiguration test results are shown for damaged aircraft models including component as well as structural failures.

40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) {{refers to}} a group of {{spatially}} dispersed and dedicated sensors for monitoring and recording the physical conditions of the environment like temperature, sound, pollution levels, humidity, etc. WSNs are deployed where <b>manual</b> intervention and <b>wired</b> infrastructure installation is not feasible. Lifetime of WSNs is of major issue. Energy efficient WSNs are to be deployed to improve the network lifespan instead of replacing nodes frequently which is of high cost. In this paper, we propose CSMA/Shortest Data First (SDF) an energy efficient MAC protocol, to increase the network lifetime. CSMA/SDF modifies existing CSMA/CA protocol which is completely contention-based, by introducing a higher priority to the node with shortest data during channel access contention process. CSMA/SDF employs a distributed shortest-data-first scheduling algorithm and Anti-Starvation mechanism to allow nodes with long data also given chance to get channel access. CSMA/SDF thus reduces overall energy consumption which in turn increases network life. It also efficiently utilizes channel by reducing the probability of occurrence of collisions. The proposed solution is simulated using a discrete event network simulator, ns 2. 35 on UBUNTU 12. 04 LTS 64 bit Operating System.

40|$|Automakers are {{increasingly}} using aluminum for structural applications {{in order to}} reduce vehicle weight and improve fuel efficiency. However, aluminum bodied cars have largely been confined to lower-volume, niche markets {{due in part to the}} number of challenges associated with welding of aluminum in comparison with steel. Therefore, a need exists for new joining processes which can produce high-quality welds in thin aluminum sheet at high production rates and low cost. The recently invented double-sided arc welding (DSAW) process is one such joining process. It has been shown to be capable of producing high quality butt-joint configuration welds in thin aluminum sheet and thick steel plate. In DSAW, an arc is initiated across two torches that are mounted on either side of the workpiece, allowing it to be welded from both sides. The objective of this research was to determine the feasibility and merits of using the DSAW process to produce seam and spot welds in thin aluminum sheet in the lap-joint configuration. The double-sided arc welding (DSAW) apparatus used in the present study was powered by a single square wave alternating current variable polarity power supply to produce an arc across two liquid cooled, plasma arc welding torches. This equipment was used to produce a series of conduction-mode DSAW seam and spot welds in 1 mm thick and 1. 5 mm thick AA 5182 -O and AA 6111 sheet in the lap-joint configuration. Metallographic analysis was used to characterize the microstructure of the welds, while microhardness and tensile tests were used to characterize the mechanical properties. Since hydrogen is easily absorbed by molten aluminum, all weld specimens must be cleaned prior to welding in order to produce high quality, pore-free welds. Although previous studies had shown that the specimens could be sufficiently cleaned by degreasing and wire brushing them prior to welding, this cleaning procedure was not found to be adequate for the specimens used in this study and a more aggressive cleaning technique was required. A number of different specimen pre-cleaning techniques were examined, and a combination of degreasing, deoxidizing, and <b>manual</b> <b>wire</b> brushing was found to produce the least amount of porosity in bead-on-plate welds produced in 1. 5 mm thick AA 5182 -O sheet. Further reductions in porosity were accomplished by redesigning the shielding gas cup of the top Thermal Arc torch to promote more laminar gas flow and generate a more evenly distributed shielding gas plume. Using the redesigned shielding gas cup, a shielding gas flow rate of 10 lpm was found to provide good coverage of the weld pool and produce virtually pore-free welds. The feasibility of using the DSAW process to produce spot welds in 1 mm thick AA 5182 -O sheet in the lap-joint configuration was examined by producing a series of spot welds over a range of welding powers and weld times. Weld nuggets were produced using a welding current as low as 50 A with a cycle time of one second. However, all of the welds exhibited a pinhole at the centre of the nugget which penetrated through the entire thickness of the specimen, regardless of welding current and cycle time used. Solidification shrinkage porosity and crater cracking were also observed near the centerline of the welds. Hydrogen gas porosity and oxide tails were also observed in the welds. These defects were found to decrease the strength and quality of the spot welds made between 1 mm thick AA 5182 -O sheets in the lap-joint configuration. A series of welds were made to determine if the DSAW process could be used to produce seam welds in 1 mm thick AA 5182 -O sheet in the lap-joint configuration. Visually acceptable, crack-free welds were produced using welding powers ranging from 2. 0 kW to 5. 1 kW, at welding speeds between 10 mm/s and 70 mm/s. Welds produced within this range of welding conditions were found to possess excellent cathodic cleaning on both sides of the workpiece, a smooth weld bead, and a columnar-to-equiaxed grain transition. However, transverse cross-sections of the specimens revealed varying amounts of oxide entrainment in the weld metal which was seen most frequently as unbroken interface oxide sheets or tails at the fusion boundaries. Often times, small clusters of porosity were found to nucleate along the oxide tails. This suggested that there was insufficient fluid flow in the weld to disrupt the pre-existing oxide sheets at the interface between the sheets. Careful specimen pre-cleaning using a combination of degreasing, deoxidizing, and <b>manual</b> stainless steel <b>wire</b> brushing was found to reduce, but not eliminate the oxide tails. Microhardness testing revealed that the microhardness was relatively consistent across the weld metal, heat-affected zone (HAZ), and base metal. In a series of tensile-shear tests, all of the welded specimens were observed to fail in the weld metal, within 1 mm of the fusion boundary. Another series of seam welds were produced between 1 mm thick AA 6111 and 1 mm thick AA 5182 sheets in the lap-joint configuration to explore the nature and intensity of fluid flow in the molten weld pool responsible for breaking oxide tails. The difference in magnesium content between the two alloys produces a different microstructure and response to chemical etching, thereby revealing any effects of fluid motion in the weld pool. Relatively weak buoyancy driven fluid flow was observed when the AA 6111 sheet was placed on top of the AA 5182 sheet, and some minor stirring was seen between the two sheets. When the slightly less dense AA 5182 sheet was placed above the AA 6111 sheet, very little fluid flow was observed and the two alloys remained unmixed. Overall, the weld pool formed during DSAW was found to be very quiescent. This suggests that the normally strong Marangoni and Lorentz force induced flow seen in other arc welding processes does not occur in the double-sided arc weld pool. This leaves only a very weak buoyancy driven fluid flow which is incapable of disrupting the pre-existing oxide at the interface between the sheets immediately adjacent to the fusion zone boundary. Overall the DSAW process was found to be capable of producing visually acceptable lap-joint configuration seam welds in AA 5182 -O sheet over a wide range of welding speeds and welding powers, provided that the pre-existing oxide and any other surface contaminants were chemically removed prior to welding...|$|R
