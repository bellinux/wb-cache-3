25|$|Unlike {{marriage}} {{which has}} an international recognised legal status, there are no international treaties on recognition of unmarried couple's legal status. If an unmarried couple change residence to different countries, then the local law on where the couple is last domiciled is applied to them. This covers legal status of the relationship, rights, obligations, and all worldwide <b>movable</b> <b>and</b> <b>immovable</b> property. To otherwise interpret the law would mean if the unmarried couple had assets in several different countries, they would then need separate legal cases in each country to resolve all their <b>movable</b> <b>and</b> <b>immovable</b> property.|$|E

The impudent sinner, who injures many beings without relenting will go to hell; at the end of his life he will sink to the (place of) darkness; head downwards he comes to the place of torture. The prisoners in hell lose their senses from fright, and do not know in what direction to run.

500|$|On 16 May 1915, {{while the}} Armenian Genocide was underway, a secret {{directive}} was promulgated entitled [...] "administrative instruction regarding <b>movable</b> <b>and</b> <b>immovable</b> property abandoned by Armenians deported {{as a result}} of the war and unusual political circumstances." [...] Once enacted, the directive established special commissions, known as the [...] "Abandoned Property Commissions" [...] (Turkish: Emvâl-i Metrûke İdare Komisyonları) and the [...] "Liquidation Commissions" [...] (Turkish: Tasfiye Komisyonu), which were tasked with providing detailed information and appraising the value of assets [...] "abandoned" [...] by deportees under the guise of [...] "safeguarding" [...] them. The number of these commissions rose to 33 by January 1916. After the departure of the deportees, goods and livestock that were deemed [...] "perishable" [...] were prioritized as the first items that must be sold using public auctions, while the profits from these auctions were to be safeguarded under the entitlement of the owners. After providing documentation of the property (copies provided to the owners and the Ottoman Treasury), the directive specified that muhajirs (Turkish refugees mainly from the Balkan wars) were to be settled in the vacant lands and properties belonging to the deportees. Once settled, the refugees had to register the land and houses, while other assets that were affixed to the property, such as olive groves and vineyards, were to be allocated amongst them. Unwanted items and assets were to be sold in public auctions. According to historian Dickran Kouymjian, the settlement of muhajirs into the lands and properties of deported Armenians implies that local authorities had firsthand knowledge that the deportees were to never return.|$|E

Savitr bestows immortality on the gods as well as length of life on man. He also bestowed immortality on the Rbhus, who by the greatness of their deeds advanced to his dwelling. Like other gods, Savitr is a supporter of the cosmos. Also, he holds the whole world, a role which was also assigned to Vishnu in the Vedas.|$|R

Statistička obrada podataka otkriva način življenja, norme ponašanja pojedinca u okolnostima pred kraj života, te pravila nasljeđivanja, kroz što se može nazrijeti problematika obiteljskog i vjerskog mentaliteta društva u složenosti i mnogostrukoj određenosti svakidašnjice. The {{analysis}} {{of the culture of}} living in Zadar in the Middle Ages encompassed the testamentary material from the five volumes of the Files of notaries from Zadar, the Miscellanea collection and the previously analyzed sources such as a very extensive inventory of Mihovil Petrov from the monastery of St. Mary, the inventory of Grizogono, the late Lovro de Civalellis, a patrician from Zadar, and the testament of a patrician of Croatian descent Krešo Varikaša from Zadar. The mentioned private legal sources include testaments and inventories connected to the city of Zadar and its district formed in the period between {{the second half of the}} XVIII century and the beginning of the XV century. Data analysis included available facts about the testator, <b>movables</b> <b>and</b> <b>immovables</b> <b>and</b> categories other than <b>movables</b> <b>and</b> <b>immovables</b> such as charities or interment practices that are important in order to understand beliefs and principles characteristic of a certain socio-historical community. Reasons for writing a testamentary document should be looked for in religious politics that propagated the necessity of receiving God’s mercy as a condition for the continuity of existence while caring for progeny and their existence is less important. Overall, the gathered data is not a good indicator of the actual situation since only a small percentage of the original sources was preserved and it, in most part, refers to a higher legal population category that was surely not prevailing. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the greatest disparity in proprietary relations between social groups is not in type, numerosity and material of different objects that are in one 2 ̆ 7 s possession and in their quality of workmanship but in the object itself. The way of living and organization of residential/business space shows similarity to other Dalmatian communes and distant cities in the western European area. Individual abundance of property evident in expensive articles of clothing, valuable tableware or literature in general is following European trends of that time thus showing that Zadar, with its small but significant part of population, follows the cultural trends of its time in different aspects...|$|R

40|$|Representing Prehistory in museums, {{with all}} the contradictions that the term “representation” may imply, is always very {{controversial}} from the interpretative point of view, implicating a series of different philosophical and scientific positions, both on Prehistory itself, {{and on the way}} of introducing it to the public, particularly today with the resurfacing of the need to dedicate some attention also to the social and the so-called “immaterial” contexts, to the myths, the rites, the cults, to the interpretation of life and nature, overcoming the obsolete concept of the museums exposing manufactured articles. In the long decontestualization process of the objects involving, unfortunately, every kind of museum, the merely “academic” preparations are slowly giving in to new orientations, divided into purely aesthetical, interpretative and communicative requests. The traces of the most distant Prehistory, particularly with regard to the so-called prehistoric and tribal art, are in fact as “conceptually” fascinating, as they are poor from the merely “objectual” point of view.

2500|$|In {{the state}} of Louisiana, a mixed legal {{jurisdiction}} with strong civil law roots, prescription can be either acquisitive or liberative, both of which involve the creation or extinguishing of rights over time.

[...] Unlike the common law adverse position, Louisiana's acquisitive prescription is not a procedural bar to recovering property but {{the creation of a new}} ownership right in the property.

40|$|This chapter {{will give}} an {{overview}} of the various transfer systems for <b>movable</b> property <b>and</b> <b>immovable</b> property. It will focus on voluntary transfers based on a legal act between the transferor and transferee. First the difference between the unitary approach and the functional approach to passing of ownership will be discussed. Many legal systems have a default rule for the passing of ownership. It indicates when ownership passes, but allows parties to indicate a different moment. In principle this moment of passing of ownership is the reference point for many other legal questions. This approach is called the unitary approach. The opposite is the functional approach which does not wish to use the passing of ownership as a reference point. Within the unitary approach we can further distinguish between systems which in principle require a delivery (real or constructive) (tradition systems) and systems in which a contract of sale in principle passes ownership without delivery being needed (consensual systems). Within the tradition systems we can further distinguish between causal and abstract systems. Causal systems require a valid legal ground, such as a valid contract of sale. Abstract systems do not set this requirement and regard the validity of the transfer abstractly from the validity of the underlying legal ground. Ideally, a land register should mirror the legal status of each parcel of land. However, many legal systems allow certain unregistered rights to be set up against bona fide third parties. In many of these systems leases, even if regarded as mere contracts, work against third parties. Often the buyer of a leased property is bound to the lease even if he did not know neither could have known about the lease. The article focusses on German, French, English and Dutch law...|$|R
