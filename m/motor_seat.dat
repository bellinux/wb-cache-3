However, during renovation of these trains {{in the late}} 1970s-early 1980s, two seats located next to the driver's cabs in each car were removed and a barrier was installed level with the cab, reducing the seating in each car to 54 passengers per DM car and 70 passengers per D car. Some DM cars had the double seats in the rear section {{in front of the}} luggage compartment removed and the seats parallel with the sides extended to provide space for prams.|$|R

2500|$|Great Western Railway had {{permission}} for {{a line from}} Ealing Broadway to a station near to CLR's [...] Shepherd's Bush station, with {{a connection to the}} West London Railway and in 1911 there was agreement to connect the line to the Central London Railway and for the CLR to run trains to Ealing. Construction started in 1912 and the CLR ordered 24 new all-steel motor cars from Brush for the Ealing services. These were [...] long and equipped with an incompatible traction control system, with automatic acceleration, controlling more powerful [...] GE212 <b>motors.</b> <b>Seating</b> 32 in a heated saloon accessed by centre and end swing doors, these were the first tube cars without end gates. However, work on the line was stopped by the outbreak of World War I in 1914 and the 22 vehicles that had been received in 1915 were stored until 1917 when they were lent to the Bakerloo line. These ran on the extension to [...] Watford Junction with Piccadilly line trailers until 1920/21 when they returned to the Central London. Trailer cars were modified with new control cables compatible with the new motor cars and heaters, as the line to Ealing was not in tunnel, and two groups of stock formed, known as Tunnel (or Local) Stock and Ealing Stock. As traffic to Ealing increased, in 1925/26 eight of the original motor cars were modified to augment the Ealing Stock.|$|R
25|$|Engineer Les Harris, who had {{conducted}} dingo {{research for}} over a decade, said that, contrary to Cameron's findings, a dingo's carnassial teeth can shear through material as tough as <b>motor</b> vehicle <b>seat</b> belts. He also cited {{an example of a}} captive female dingo removing a bundle of meat from its wrapping paper and leaving the paper intact. Evidence was also presented to the effect that a dingo was strong enough to carry a kangaroo and a report of the removal of a three-year-old girl by a dingo from {{the back seat of a}} tourist's motor vehicle at the camping area just weeks before, an event witnessed by the parents.|$|R
40|$|Feeding {{difficulties}} {{are common in}} children with neurological impairments and impact on growth and nutrition, general health, developmental outcomes and quality of life. Factors such as gross <b>motor</b> skills, <b>seating</b> and positioning for feeding, oral motor dysfunction, effectiveness of swallowing, co-morbidities and feeding related behaviours all influence a child's ability for safe and effective feeding. Identification of feeding problems relies on careful assessment involving a number of professionals. Management strategies are best delivered by a multi-professional team skilled {{in the care of}} children with neurological impairment and feeding impairments. The wider effects of feeding difficulty on the psychological health of both child and carer must be considered. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
50|$|Two gliders were {{featured}} in the film: The UFM Easy Riser and the Cosmos Trike. The Easy Riser first appears as a foot-launched biplane hang glider. True to Lishman's real-life saga, modifications were made to improve the design including {{the addition of a}} <b>motor</b> and <b>seat.</b> Anna Paquin's character instead flies an A-frame Cosmos Trike with a mock goose head mounted to the noseplate of the airframe and a fabric wing covering painted to resemble feathers. The Cosmos Trike was reportedly chosen for its safety, superior engine power, and increased wing size (a feature that was needed to fly slow enough for the birds).|$|R
50|$|Each robot had {{to weigh}} {{no more than}} 70 lb and fit, unconstrained, inside a {{cylinder}} with a diameter of 36 in and a height of 30 in. The robots used two 12 volt Milwaukee drill motors, four Delco car <b>seat</b> <b>motors,</b> and two Textron pneumatic pumps which, through a customized remote control system, were powered by two 12 volt Milwaukee Drill batteries.|$|R
