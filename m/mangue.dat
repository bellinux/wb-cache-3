5|$|Before the conquest, El Salvador {{formed a}} part of the Mesoamerican {{cultural}} region. The central and western portions of the territory were inhabited by the Pipil, a Nahua people related to the Aztecs of Mexico. The Pipil were divided into three main provinces in El Salvador; the two largest were Cuscatlan and Izalco, while Nonualco was the smallest of the three. Cuscatlan extended from the Paz River in the west to the Lempa River in the east. Izalco lay to the southwest of Cuscatlan and was subservient to it {{on the eve of the}} Spanish conquest; its territory is now incorporated into the modern departments of Ahuachapan and Sonsonate. Other indigenous groups with territories in El Salvador were the Ch'orti' and the Poqomam (both of these were Maya peoples), the Lenca, the Xinca, and the Matagalpa. The Postclassic Maya and Pipil cities were relatively small by Mesoamerican standards, especially when compared with the great Maya cities of the earlier Classic period (c. 250–950 AD). The Lenca occupied territory to the east of the Lempa River, where their principal kingdom was Chaparrastique. Chaparrastique extended across territory now incorporated into the departments of La Unión, Morazán, and San Miguel. The Ch'orti' and Poqomam occupied territories in the west. The extreme east of El Salvador was occupied by the <b>Mangue,</b> with the Matagalpa in the southeast. The population of the entire territory of El Salvador is variously estimated at anything between 130,000 and 1,000,000 at the time of the conquest; the low-mid estimates within this range are more likely.|$|E

CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR 4) is a cell surface marker associated with several severe human pathologies, including colorectal cancer, for which intracellular targeting agents are currently missing. Results: Four different peptides that bind CXCR 4 were tested {{for their ability}} to internalize a green fluorescent protein-based reporter nanoparticle into CXCR 4 + cells. Among them, only the 18 mer peptide T 22, an engineered segment derivative of polyphemusin II from the horseshoe crab, efficiently penetrated target cells via a rapid, receptor-specific endosomal route. This resulted in accumulation of the reporter nanoparticle in a fully fluorescent and stable form in the perinuclear region of the target cells, without toxicity either in cell culture or in an in vivo model of metastatic colorectal cancer. Conclusion: Given the urgent demand for targeting agents in the research, diagnosis, and treatment of CXCR 4 -linked diseases, including colorectal cancer and human immunodeficiency virus infection, T 22 appears to be a promising tag for the intracellular delivery of protein drugs, nanoparticles, and imaging agents.

40|$|The poor {{prognosis}} of pancreatic cancer and poor sensitivity to current therapeutics, associated with resistance to apoptosis, urge {{the search for}} new drugs. We previously described the induction of caspase-independent mithochondrial death in leukemia cells by Bobel- 24 (AM- 24) and derivatives. Here, we explored whether these compounds induce a similar cytotoxicity in human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines (NP 18, NP 9, NP 31, and NP 29). Bobel- 24 or Bobel- 16 induced cytotoxicity and DNA synthesis inhibition in all cell lines and apoptosis in all lines, except for NP 9. Caspase and/or poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase- 1 (PARP- 1) activity inhibition experiments showed that cytotoxicity was mainly induced through apoptosis in NP 18 and through a caspase-independent process in NP 9. Moreover, in NP 29 or NP 31 cell lines, both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent cell death mechanisms coexisted. Cell death was associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial depolarization, cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) release, AIF nuclear translocation, and lysosomal cathepsin release. Inhibition of ROS production, mitochondrial pore permeability, PARP- 1, or phospholipase A 2 partially prevented cell death. Moreover, cathepsin B inhibition or down-regulation by small interfering RNA partially blocked cell death. In conclusion, Bobel- 24 and derivatives trigger caspase-independent lysosomal and mitochondrial death in all tested human pancreatic cancer lines, irrespective of their degree of apoptotic sensitivity, becoming the only active cytotoxic mechanism in the apoptosis-resistant NP 9 line. This mechanism may overcome the resistance to apoptosis observed in pancreatic carcinoma when treated with current genotoxic drugs. Â© 2008 American Association for Cancer Research.

40|$|Com o emprego da armadilha CDC determinou-se a composição específica da fauna de mosquitos Culicidae em locais com vegetação primária, situados em terras baixas e próximas a <b>mangues,</b> no litoral sul do Estado de São Paulo (Brasil). Como resultado geral foram obtidos cerca de 64 espécies ou grupos. Entre as que foram mais freqüentes destacaram-se Culex (Mel.) sacchettae (71, 6 %), Anopheles (Ker.) cruzii (10, 5 %), Phoniomiya spp. (8, 2 %) e Culex (Mel.) taeniopus (2, 9 %). Também com este método de coleta, nos horários crepuscular vespertino, noturno, ao lado do uso de isca ave e roedor, a dominância nítida foi de Cx. sacchettae, ao contrário do que ocorreu no mesmo local com isca humana, quando An. cruzii foi a espécie predominante. A diversidade calculada para o {{interior}}, margem da mata, campo aberto e domicílio, tendo sido de 1, 7 a 6, 2 revelou fauna relativamente rica para Culicidae. Não obstante a marcante presença de Culex (Cux.) quinquefasciatus no domicílio, foi inesperada a elevada freqüência de Cx. sacchettae. Além disso, a presença proporcional de An. cruzii no solo e copa sugere mobilidade desse anofelino no interior da floresta, enquanto que a sua atividade em ambiente extraflorestal revelou ser restrita. Nesse particular, Cx. sacchettae demonstrou ser espécie ubiqüista e ocorrente durante todos os meses do ano, porém com picos mais elevados nas estações verão e outono. Using a CDC light-trap, {{the specific}} fauna composition of mosquitoes Culicidae was determined at places with primary vegetation of lowlands near swampy areas along the Southern coast of S. Paulo State, Brazil. As a result, about 64 species or groups were found. Among the more frequent ones, Culex (Mel.) sacchettae (71. 6 %), Anopheles (Ker.) cruzii (10. 5 %), Phoniomiya spp. (8. 2 %) and Culex (Mel.) taeniopus (2. 9 %) were outstanding. Also {{by the use}} of this method of capture, with fowls and rodents as animal bait, in vespertine dusk and night periods, the Cx. sacchettae showed a clear dominance, which was the opposite of what occured at the same places, using human bait, when An. cruzii was the predominant species. Ranging from 1. 7 to 6. 2, the diversity estimated for inland, edge forest, open field and residential areas showed a relatively rich fauna of Culicidae. Despite the marked presence of Culex (Cux.) quinquefasciatus in domiciliary area, the high frequence of Cx. sacchettae was rather unexpected. Moreover, the proportional presence of An. cruzii, both on the ground and in forest canopy suggests the mobility of this anophelinae inside the wood, while its activity in extraforest environments has revealed itself to be very restricted. In this particular case, Cx. sacchettae has shown itself as the most ubiquitons and frequently occurring species throughout the year, although its higher density peaks occur in summer and autumn...|$|R
40|$|The {{study area}} is bounded by the cities Paraíso do Norte, Gurupi, and Dianópolis in north-central Goiás State. The area {{contains}} diverse lithostratigraphic units and various generations of structures related to distinct thermo-tectonic events. Based {{on the distribution}} and the petrographic and structural characteristics of the ancient rock assemblage, four litho-structural domains were defined and attributed to the Archean. Domain " 1 " includes the region of Almas-Dianópolis and is interpreted as part of granite-greenstone terrane. It includes a group of tonalitic gneisses with associated supracrustal rocks (Goiano Complex), a sequence of metavolcanic rocks and metasediments (Riachão do Ouro Group), and various tonalite bodies (Serra do Boqueirão Suite) intruded into the earlier units. The evolution of the domain includes three principal deformational events: a) Formation of the amphibolites and/or biotite gneisses and granitoids characterized by sub-vertical banding oriented N 10 ºE and accompanied by mineralogical changes under conditions of amphibolite facies; b) deposition of the Riachão do Ouro Group, followed by isoclinal folding oriented N 10 °E and consequent transformation to greenschist facies. The emplacement of the tonalitic diapirs of the Serra do Boqueirão Suite is related to this event; c) a foliation gently inclined to the SE resulting from a simple low-angle ductile-brittle shearing process which affected the west part of this domain, transforming the rocks of the Goiano Complex into mylonitic gneisses under amphibolite facies conditions. Domain 2 includes the counties of Porto Nacional, Brejinho de Nazaré, and Natividade in the east-central part of the area. It is characterized by granulitic gneisses (Porto Nacional Complex), by tonalitic gneisses with associated supracrustal rocks (Manoel Alves Complex), including metasediments and metavolcanics (Morro do Aquiles Formation), and by pegmatitic granites such as the Xobó Suite. The different lithologic units {{take the form of}} lenses or sub-horizontal concordant to sub-concordant bodies with strike N 30 °E. They show structural features produced by a low-angle ductile-brittle shearing process under amphibolite facies conditions. Superposed on the low-angle features are various zones of high-angle directional shear having different intensities of deformation, but all in greenschist facies conditions. Domain 3 is within the NW part of Paraiso do Norte county and is interpreted as a granite-greenstone terrane similar to that of Domain 1. This Domain includes the Colméia Complex, the Rio do Coco Group, and the alkaline gneisses of Monte Santo. Two principal deformational phases are responsible for the structures in this domain: a) folding (S) of the gneissic granitoids of the Colméia Complex into recumbent folds oriented E-W. The axial plane schistosity (S 1) formed in medium to amphibolite facies conditions; b) deposition of the Rio do Coco Group, discordant with the Colméia Complex, followed by sub-vertical folding oriented E-W. The second generation of folds in the Colméia Complex is related to this deformational event. Domain 4, in the west-central part of the area, includes parts of Paraíso do Norte, Fatima, Gurupi, and Porto Nacional counties. This domain is composed of the Rio dos <b>Mangues</b> Complex, the Matança and Serrote Suites, and the alcaline gneisses of the Serra da Estrela, distributed in sub-concordant sheets oriented N 30 °E. Similarly to that observed in Domain 2, these rock assemblages show structural features related to low-and high-angle shearing events. The transition between Domains 1 and 2 and between Domains 3 and 4 is gradational, such that two ancient blocks of crust are defined (Domains 1 + 2 and 3 + 4] separated by a belt of granulitic rocks (Porto Nacional Complex). The zone of juxtaposition corresponda to a belt of low-angle ductile shearing developed by the overthrusting of the Brazilian block, on the east, onto the Araguacema block to the west. Similar geologic conditions have been well characterized in South Africa, in western Greenland, and in NW Scotland and are beginning to be described in various regions in Brazil, constituting a new way to understand the relations between Archean terranes. Granite bodies of the Lajeado Suite {{at the end of the}} Lower Proterozoic and ultrabasic bodies in the first half of the Middle Proterozoic were injected into this crustal segment stabilized at the end of the Archean. During this epoch the Transbrazilian Lineament became defined as a brittle shear zone. Basins were developed in the second half of the Middle Proterozoic, with deposition of the Baixo Araguaia Supergroup and the Natividade Group. These two are separated today by a block limited by the cities of Paraíso do Norte, Gurupi, and Porto Nacional. The Transbrazilian Lineament was reactivated in this period. At the end of the Middle Proterozoic an E-W regional compression produced the Araguaia and Uruaçu fold belts. The evolution of the Araguaia fold belt involved four stages of structural deformation. In the first stage, N-S recumbent folds were formed having axial plane schistosity (S 1) developed in intermediate amphibolite facies to intermediate greenschist facies conditions. The intermediary stages involved folding and refolding of the S 1. The last stage is related to the formation of domai structures resulting from the intrusion of the granite bodies of the Santa Luzia Suite. As a result of this evolution, the Araguaia belt has an importent asymmetry characterized by intensification of deformation and mineralogical transformations from west to east. The Uruaçu fold belt is In general characterized by folds with variably-oriented axial planes and mineralogical changes tipical of greenschist facies. In the studied region, regular variations In deformational intensity and metamorphic degree were not found. The immature sediments of the Monte do Carmo Formation are the products of the last lithogenetic processes of the Middle Proterozoic in the area. During the evolution of the Araguaia and Uruaçu fold belts, the north part of the Goiano massif had a limited participation in such a way that it functioned as a rigid block with respect to the folding on either side. The final products related to the polycyclic evolution of this crustal segment during the Priecambrian are represented by directional fault systems oriented principally N 40 º - 60 ºE and N 40 º - 50 º W. The NE system of faults reflects a reactivation of the Transbrazilian Lineament in the Upper Proterozoic. Thick sedimentary sequences were deposited in the Phanerozoic and new movements on the Transbrazilian Lineament caused the development of important block faulting which is reflected in part by the present-day geomorphology of the area. CNPq - Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e TecnológicoNa região compreendida entre as cidades de Paraíso do Norte, Gurupi e Dianópolis, situada na parte centro norte do Estado de Goiás, reconhecem-se diversas unidades lito-estratigráficas e várias gerações de estruturas ligadas a eventos termo-tectônicos distintos. Considerando a distribuição e as características petrográficas e estruturais dos conjuntos rochosos antigos, foi possível individualizar quatro compartimentos ou domínios lito-estruturais atribuídos ao Arqueano. O domínio 1 inclui a região de Almas-Dianópolis, é interpretado como um terreno granito-greenstone, englobando um conjunto de gnaisses tonalíticos com supracrustais associadas (Complexo Goiano), e vários corpos de tonalitos (Suíte Serra do Boqueirão) embutidos nas unidades anteriores. A evolução geral do domínio compreende três eventos deformacionais principais. O primeiro se refere à formação dos anfibolitos e/ ou biotita gnaisse e granitóides, caracterizados estruturalmente por um bandamentos sub-vertical, orientado na direção N 10 ° E. O desenvolvimento desse elemento planar foi acompanhado por transformações mineralógicas e fácies anfibolito. O segundo evento corresponde à deposição do Grupo Riachão do Ouro, seguida pela formação de estruturas sinclinais isoclinais empinadas, orientadas na direção N 10 ° E, contemporânea a transformações em fácies xisto verde. A esse evento se relaciona a colocação dos diápiros tonalíticos da Suíte Serra do Boqueirão. O último é representado por uma foliação de transposição suavemente inclinada para sudeste, vinculada a um processo de cisalhamento simples dúctil-rúptil de baixo ângulo, que afetou a parte oeste do domínio e transformou as rochas do Complexo Goiano em gnaisses miloníticos em condições de fácies anfibolito. O domínio 2 envolve os municípios de Porto Nacional, Brejinho de Nazaré e Natividade, correspondendo à parte centro-leste da área. Caracterizado por gnaisses granulíticos (Complexo Porto Nacional), por gnaisses tonalíticos com supra crustais associadas (Complexo Manoel Alves), por conjuntos supracrustais, envolvendo metassedimentos e metavulcânicas (Formação Morro do Aquiles), e por granitos pegmatóides, a exemplo da Suíte Xobó. As diferentes unidades litológicas apresentam-se na forma de camadas e/ ou pacotes sub-horizontais, concordantes a sub-concordantes e orientadas na direção N 30 °. Exibem feições estruturais produzidas por um processo de cisalhamento simples dúctil-rúptil de baixo ângulo, em condições de fácies anfibolito. Várias zonas de cisalhamento dúctil de alto ângulo, com caráter direcional, com diferentes intensidades de deformação e desenvolvidas em condições de fácies xisto verde, superpõem-se às feições estruturais ligadas ao evento de cisalhamento de baixo ângulo. O domínio 3 acha-se totalmente incluído no município de Paraíso do Norte, na porção noroeste da área, e é interpretado como um terreno granito-greenstone, a exemplo do domínio 1. Fazem parte desse domínio o Complexo Colméia, o Grupo Rio do Côco e os gnaisses alcalinos de Monte Santo. Duas fases de deformação principais são responsáveis pela estruturação geral do domínio. A fase mais antiga corresponde ao dobramento do bandamento (s) dos granitoides gnaissificados do Complexo Colméia, em dobras recumbentes, orientadas na direção E-W. A xistosidade (S 1) plano-axial se formou em condições de fácies anfibolito média a alta. A fase seguinte diz respeito à constituição do Grupo Rio do Côco em discordância com o Complexo Colméia. Nesse evento estabeleceram-se dobras empinadas orientadas na direção E-W e formou-se uma xistosidade em condições de fácies xisto verde. A segunda geração de dobras do Complexo Colméia está relacionada a esse evento deformacional. O domínio 4 é definido pela região que compreende parte dos municípios de Paraíso do Norte, Fátima, Gurupi e Porto Nacional, correspondendo à porção centro-oeste da área. Faz parte desse domínio o Complexo Rio dos <b>Mangues,</b> as suítes Matança e Serrote e os gnaisses alcalinos da Serra da Estrela, dispostos em corpos tabulares sub-concordantes orientados na direção N 30 °E. A exemplo do que se observa nas unidades do domínio 2, os diferentes conjuntos rochosos do domínio 4 exibem feições estruturais ligadas aos eventos de cisalhamento de baixo e alto ângulos. A passagem entre os domínios 1 e 2 e entre os domínios 3 e 4 é gradativa de modo que se delineiam dois blocos crustais antigos (domínios 1 + 2 e 3 + 4) separados pela faixa de rochas granulíticas (Complexo Porto Nacional). A zona de justaposição corresponde a um cinturão de cisalhamento dúctil de baixo ângulo, desenvolvido a partir do cavalgamento do bloco Brasília, a leste, sobre o bloco Araguacema, a oeste. Quadro geológico semelhante já foi muito bem caracterizado na África do Sul, no Oeste da Groelândia e no noroeste da Escócia, e começa a ser esboçado em várias regiões no Brasil, configurando-se uma nova maneira de entender as relações entre os terrenos arqueanos. Nesse segmento crustal, estabilizado no final do Arqueano, foram injetados corpos graníticos da Suíte Lajeado, no final do Proterozoico Inferior, e corpos básico-ultrabásicos na primeira metade do Proterozoico Médio. Nesta época, o Lineamento Transbrasiliano se individualizou como zona de cisalhamento rúptil. Na segunda metade do Proterozoico Médio instalaram-se as bacias, onde se depositaram as rochas que constituem o Supergrupo Baixo Araguaia e o Grupo Natividade, separadas por um bloco limitado hoje, pelas cidades de Paraíso do Norte, Gurupi ePorto Nacional. O lineamento Transbrasiliano voltou a ser ativo nesse período. No final do Proterozoico Médio, uma compressão regional, aproximadamente E-W, permitiu a edificação das faixas de dobramentos Araguaia e Uruaçu. A evolução da faixa de dobramentos Araguaia envolve quatro estágios de formação de estruturas. No primeiro estágio formaram-se dobras recumbentes submeridianas, com uma xistosidade plano axial (S 1) desenvolvida em condições de fácies anfibolito média a xisto verde média. Os estágios intermediários referem-se a dobramentos e redobramentos de S 1. O último estágio corresponde à formação dos corpos graníticos da Suíte Santa Luzia. Como resultado dessa evolução, verifica-se na faixa Araguaia uma assimetria importante, caracterizada pela atenuação de deformação e das transformações mineralógicas de leste para oeste. O quadro geral da faixa de dobramento Uruaçu é caracterizado por dobras desenhadas pelo acamamento, com planos axiais variáveis e por transformações mineralógicas em fácies xisto verde. Na região estudada não existem variações regulares na intensidade da deformação e do grau metamórfico. Os sedimentos imaturos da Formação Monte do Carmo são os produtos dos últimos processos litogenéticos de Proterozóico Médio na área. Durante a evolução das faixas de dobramentos Araguaia e Uruaçu, a parte norte do Maciço Goiano teve uma participação limitada, de tal modo que funcionou como um bloco rígido em relação aos dobramentos laterais. Os produtos finais ligados à evolução policíclica desse segmento crustalno Pré-Cambriano. São representados por sistemas de falhas direcionais orientadas principalmente nas direções N 40 °- 60 ° E e N 40 ° - 50 ° W. O sistema de falhas NE reflete nova movimentação através do Lineamento Transbrasiliano no Proterozoico Superior. No Fanerozoico depositaram-se expressivas sequências sedimentares e novos movimentos foram registrados no Lineamento Transbrasiliano levando ao desenvolvimento de importantes desnivelamentos de blocos, refletidos, em parte, na morfologia atual da área...|$|R

The name [...] "Maracanã" [...] derives from the indigenous Tupi–Guarani word for a type of parrot which inhabited the region. The stadium construction was prior to the formation of the later Maracanã neighborhood, that was once part of Tijuca.|$|E

Se bought her own $1.15 million residence in Potomac, Maryland, {{not to be confused}} with her husband's home in the same city. At one point, five accounts and three certificates of deposit at Riggs Bank were held in Constancia's name, and ExxonMobil made several payments into these accounts. Andrew P. Swiger of ExxonMobil told investigators that his firm co-owned the Obiang energy firm Abayak with Constancia, who, he said, received 15 percent of all revenue from Abayak.|$|E
2500|$|Settlement of Cholula began between 500 and 200 BCE (middle Pre Classic period), {{with two}} small villages {{established}} near water sources {{in what is}} now {{the eastern side of the}} city. They were two of a number of agricultural villages with ceremonial centers in the area, with evidence of emerging social stratification. Its earliest settlers were probably speakers of Oto-Manguean languages, linguist Terrence Kaufman has proposed that they were speakers of the Chorotega language of the <b>Mangue</b> branch of the oto-mangue family. The various small rivers and streams allowed for irrigated agriculture and at one time, several converged into a shallow lake, which may have been used for chinampas. [...] At the end of the Pre-classic, many other settlements in the area were abandoned but Cholula grew, possibly with migration from these other settlements. This made Cholula the dominant political force in the region. This was also the time when work on the Great Pyramid began, along with another monument called the Edificio Rojo. Cholula continued to grow during the Classic period (200 – 800 CE) to an extension of over [...] and a population of between 20,000 and 25,000. It also remained dominant over the Puebla-Tlaxcala region, with more monumental construction, including the addition of two stages to the Great Pyramid.|$|E
6000|$|Bidding kindly adieu to Mr. Hunter {{and wishing}} him speedy {{deliverance}} from his dreadful companion, we resumed our travel over the now tranquil main. Always to starboard remained the narrow sea-wall, a length without breadth {{which we had}} seen after the lowlands of Cape Lopez, coloured rosy, rusty-red, or white, and sometimes backed by a second sierra of low blue rises, which suggests the sanatorium. Forty miles showed us the tall trees of Point Palmas on the northern side of the Conza River; on {{the south of the}} gap-like mouth lies the Ambrizette settlement, with large factories, Portuguese and American, gleaming against the dark verdure, and with Conza Hill for a background. The Cabeça de Cobra, or [...] "Margate Head," [...] led to Makula, alias Mangal, or <b>Mangue</b> Grande, lately a clump of trees and a point; now the site of English, American, and Dutch factories. Here the hydrographic charts of 1827 and 1863 greatly vary, and one has countermarched the coast-line some 75 miles: Beginning with the Congo River, it lays down <b>Mangue</b> Pegueno (where Grande should be), Cobra, and <b>Mangue</b> Grande (for Pequeno) close to Ambrizette. Then hard ahead rose Cape Engano, whose [...] "deceit" [...] is a rufous tint, which causes many to mistake it for Cape or Point Padrão. To-morrow, as the dark-green waters tell us, we shall be in the Congo River.|$|E
6000|$|After a {{pleasant}} breezy night upon the brown waters, on September 1st we hove anchor betimes {{and made for}} Scotchman's Head, a conspicuous mangrove bluff forming a fine landmark on the left bank. The charts have lately shifted it some two miles west of its old position. Six or seven miles beyond it rise the blue uplands of the [...] "Earldom of Sonho." [...] On our right, in mid-stream, lay a [...] "crocodile bank," [...] a newly fixed grass islet, a few square feet of green and gold, which the floods will presently cover or carry away. To the left, above the easternmost [...] "Mombang" [...] and the network of islands behind it, opens the gape of the Malela River, a short cut to French Point, found useful when a dangerous tide- rip {{is caused by the}} strong sea-breeze meeting the violent current of the Thalweg. Above it lies a curious formation like concentric rings of trees inclosing grass: it is visible only from the north-east. Several slave factories now appear on either shore, single-storied huts of wood and thatch, in holes cut out of the densest bush, an impenetrable forest whose sloppy soil and miry puddles seem never to dry. The tenements serve as videttes and outposts, enabling cargoes to ship without the difficulties of passing Palm Point, and thus to make a straight run down stream. There are three on the north bank, viz. M. Rágis (aîné), now deserted, Sr. Lima Viana, and Sr. Antonio Fernandez; and three on the left side, Sr. Alessandro Ferreira, Sr. Guilherme, and Sr. Fonseca. Those on the southern or left bank facilitate overland transit to <b>Mangue,</b> Ambrizette, and other dépôts. At present it is [...] "tiempo seco" [...] (dull time), and the gérants keep their hands in by buying ground-nuts and palm oil. The slave trade, however, makes 500, not 50, per cent., and the agents are naturally fond of it, their mere salaries being only some 150 francs a month.|$|E
