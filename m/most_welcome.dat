5|$|The {{first edition}} of this work, {{published}} in 1861, was received so favourably that the author has felt bound to bestow his utmost care upon a minute and thorough revision of his book, {{in the hope of}} bringing up the information it contains to the existing state of knowledge. In this endeavour he has been assisted as well by Canon Lightfoot, to whom he is indebted for that section of the third chapter which treats of Egyptian versions of the New Testament (pp. 319-357), as also by much unsought for and <b>most</b> <b>welcome</b> help, especially {{on the part of those}} scholars who are named in p. 164, note. Without wishing to speak harshly of writers who are not very scrupulous in such matters, he has always thought it became him to borrow from no quarter without making a full and frank avowal of the fact. The author will be much rejoiced if this new edition shall be judged not less worthy than its predecessor to become a text book in Universities and Theological Celleges.|$|E
5|$|The war policy 1547–1549 had entailed an {{extraordinary}} expenditure of about £350,000p.a. against a regular Crown income of £150,000p.a. It {{was impossible to}} continue in this way, and Dudley quickly negotiated a withdrawal of the besieged English garrison at Boulogne. The high costs of the garrison could thus be saved and French payments of redemption of roughly £180,000 were a <b>most</b> <b>welcome</b> cash income. The peace with France was concluded in the Treaty of Boulogne in March 1550. There was both public rejoicing and anger at the time, and some historians have condemned the peace as a shameful surrender of English-held territory. A year later {{it was agreed that}} King Edward was to have a French bride, the six-year-old Elisabeth of Valois. The threat of war with Scotland was also neutralised, England giving up some isolated garrisons in exchange. In the peace treaty with Scotland of June 1551, a joint commission, one of {{the first of its kind}} in history, was installed to agree upon the exact boundary between the two countries. This matter was concluded in August 1552 by French arbitration. Despite the cessation of hostilities, English defences were kept on a high level: nearly £200,000p.a. were spent on the navy and the garrisons at Calais and on the Scottish border. In his capacity as Warden-General of the Scottish Marches, Northumberland arranged for the building of a new Italianate fortress at Berwick-upon-Tweed.|$|E

[...] "I met Tchaikovsky quite often both at Balakirev's and at my own home", Glazunov remembered. [...] "We usually met over music.

[...] This circle, with which Tchaikovsky would spend an increasing amount of time {{in the last couple of}} years of his life, would come to be known as the Belyayev circle, named after its patron, Belyayev. According to musicologist Richard Taruskin, Belyayev, through his financial influence, would shape Russian music more greatly and lastingly than either Balakirev or Stasov were able to do.|$|E

2500|$|On October 18, 1996, Velasquez's seventh album, Retro, was released. The album {{featured}} cover {{versions of}} international hit singles in the 1970s and 1980s from {{artists such as}} The Carpenters, Donna Summer, Melissa Manchester, Andy Gibb and Olivia Newton-John among others. The album's first single, [...] "Fly", was released {{and is the only}} original song from the record. Maurice White, Al McKay, and Allee Willis, the members of the American disco-soul group Earth, Wind & Fire, are credited as songwriters because the song interpolates the melody of their 1978 song [...] "September". David Gonzales of AllMusic expressed approval of the album’s content having a [...] "considerable amount of adventurous, modern music, often performed in a rhythm & blues vein, a <b>most</b> <b>welcome</b> development {{in a country where the}} local music scene is dominated by easy listening love songs." [...] Though he pointed out the musical direction the album went with, steering away from the stereotypical genre: [...] "Filipinos will [...] listen to adventurous music by international artists, but expect their own singers to remain in an [...] "easy listening" [...] musical straitjacket. [...] the success of the album also points to one of the drawbacks on the Philippine music scene, oftentimes Filipinos prefer international music, and remakes thereof, than music composed by their countrymen." [...] Commercially, Retro has sold over 160,000 units in regional and domestic sales. That same year, Velasquez began working on the final album per her record contract with PolyCosmic. Love Was Born On Christmas Day was released in December 1996, along with the debut of its lead single of the same title. By the end of 1996, Velasquez has grown dissatisfied with the music and image her management label had created for her and felt that the company was treating her as a product instead of a person, having been marketed with the influence of Cantopop, J-pop and K-pop genre because of its financial trend. Along with her dissatisfaction on the creative direction of her music, Velasquez also resented being forbidden to openly state her ethnicity in order to maintain a favorable public image, as Filipinos have been indiscriminately identified as domestic workers in the region. As a result, Velasquez parted ways from PolyCosmic and signed a five-album recording contract with VIVA Records, resuming her music career in the Philippines.|$|E
