500|$|The {{main cause}} of TB is Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} (MTB), a small, aerobic, nonmotile bacillus. The high lipid content of this pathogen accounts for many of its unique clinical characteristics. It divides every 16 to 20 hours, which is an extremely slow rate compared with other bacteria, which usually divide {{in less than an}} hour. Mycobacteria have an outer <b>membrane</b> <b>lipid</b> bilayer. If a Gram stain is performed, MTB either stains very weakly [...] "Gram-positive" [...] or does not retain dye {{as a result of the}} high lipid and mycolic acid content of its cell wall. MTB can withstand weak disinfectants and survive in a dry state for weeks.

2500|$|Glycogen {{synthesis}} is also {{stimulated by}} the insulin receptor via IRS-1. [...] In this case, it is the SH2 domain of PI-3 kinase (PI-3K) that binds the P-Tyr of IRS-1. [...] Now activated, PI-3K can convert the <b>membrane</b> <b>lipid</b> phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3). [...] This indirectly activates a protein kinase, PKB (Akt), via phosphorylation. [...] PKB then phosphorylates several target proteins, including glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3). [...] GSK-3 is responsible for phosphorylating (and thus deactivating) glycogen synthase. [...] When GSK-3 is phosphorylated, it is deactivated, and prevented from deactivating glycogen synthase. [...] In this roundabout manner, insulin increases glycogen synthesis.|$|E
40|$|One of the well-characterized {{phenomena}} {{associated with}} the acclimation of organisms to changes in ambient temperature is the regulation of the molecular motion or "fluidity" of <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> via changes in the extent of unsaturation of the fatty acids of <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids.</b> The enzymes responsible for this process when the temperature is decreased are the desaturases, the activities of which are enhanced at low temperature. To examine whether {{the change in the}} fluidity of <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> is the first event that signals a change in temperature, we studied the effect of the Pd-catalyzed hydrogenation of <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> on the expression of the desA gene, which is responsible for the desaturation of fatty acids of <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803. The Pd-catalyzed hydrogenation of plasma <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> stimulated the expression of the desA gene. We also found that, for unexplained reasons, the hydrogenation was much more specific to a minor phospholipid, phosphatidylglycerol, than to members of other lipid classes. These results suggest that the organism perceives a decrease in the fluidity of plasma <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> when it is exposed to a decrease in temperature...|$|R

At the cell surface, {{on the opposite side}} of the cell <b>membrane</b> <b>lipid</b> anchored proteins are covalently attached to the lipids glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) and cholesterol. Protein association with membranes through the use of acylated residues is a reversible process, as the acyl chain can be buried in a protein's hydrophobic binding pocket after dissociation from the membrane. This process occurs within the beta-subunits of G-proteins [...] Perhaps because of this additional need for structural flexibility, lipid anchors are usually bound to the highly flexible segments of proteins tertiary structure that are not well resolved by protein crystallographic studies.|$|E
2500|$|In {{plants and}} microbes, {{changes in the}} lipid {{composition}} of cell membranes {{have been linked to}} cold tolerance. The enhanced resistance to cold treatment appears to be caused by an increased amount of fatty acid desaturases produced under cold stress transforming saturated into unsaturated fatty acids in the membrane. This effect can be reproduced artificially in genetically engineered plants. The changes in <b>membrane</b> <b>lipid</b> composition lead to a higher membrane fluidity, thus keeping the membrane from [...] "freezing" [...] at low temperatures. This [...] "lipid hypothesis of cold tolerance" [...] is less well supported in animals. In fruit flies, cold acclimation does not coincide with a reduced amount of saturated fatty acids, and recent genetic studies on a nematode indicate that the mechanisms involved in cold adaptation in animals may be different from those in plants and microbes.|$|E

These peptides include two or more positively charged residues provided by arginine, lysine or, in acidic environments, histidine, and a large proportion (generally >50%) of hydrophobic residues. The secondary structures of these molecules follow 4 themes, including i) α-helical, ii) β-stranded due to the presence of 2 or more disulfide bonds, iii) β-hairpin or loop due to the presence of a single disulfide bond and/or cyclization of the peptide chain, and iv) extended. Many of these peptides are unstructured in free solution, and fold into their final configuration upon partitioning into biological membranes. It contains hydrophilic amino acid residues aligned along one side and hydrophobic amino acid residues aligned along the opposite side of a helical molecule. This amphipathicity of the antimicrobial peptides allows them to partition into the <b>membrane</b> <b>lipid</b> bilayer. The ability to associate with membranes is a definitive feature of antimicrobial peptides although membrane permeabilization is not necessary. These peptides have a variety of antimicrobial activities ranging from membrane permeabilization to action on a range of cytoplasmic targets.|$|E

These include measurements with the headgroups of <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> in solution, immobilized <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids,</b> and analysis of protein binding to <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> reconstituted in liposomes. Each of these methodologies has strengths but also substantial limitations. For example, measurements between proteins and lipid headgroups or with immobilized <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> do not probe interactions in their natural environment, the lipid bilayer. The use of liposomes, however, was so far mostly restricted to biochemical flotation experiments that do not provide quantitative and/or kinetic data.

This technique allows for quantitative measurements of interactions between multiple fluorescently labeled proteins and <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> reconstituted in lipid bilayers.

40|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} of <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> varies systematically among species {{in a manner}} that is consistent with their metabolic rate and longevity. Because the susceptibility of fatty acids to peroxidation relates directly to their extent of unsaturation, it is possible to calculate a peroxidation index (PI) for membranes through characterization of their specific fatty acid composition. Long-living mammals and birds have <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> with a lower PI than shorter-living species. Bird and mammal species with the same maximum life span also have <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> with essentially the same PI. Exceptionally long-living mammals and birds usually have <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> high in monounsaturates, but low in polyunsaturates, with the consequence that the PI of their <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> is as low as expected for their respective longevity. Longevity variation within species (whether due to calorie-restriction, extended longevity associated with specific strains, queen-worker differences in honey bees or inherited longevity differences among humans) is also associated with differences in membrane composition and PI.

40|$|AbstractThe {{composition}} of <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> {{is sensitive to}} environmental stresses. Submergence {{is a type of}} stress often encountered by plants. However, how the molecular species of <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> respond to submergence has not yet been characterised. In this study, we used a lipidomic approach to profile the molecular species of <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> in whole plants of Arabidopsis thaliana that were completely submerged for three days. The plants survived one day of submergence, after which, we found that the total <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> were only subtly decreased, showing significant decreases of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) and an increase of phosphatidic acid (PA); however, the basic lipid composition was retained. In contrast, three days of submergence caused plants to die, and the membranes deteriorated via the rapid loss of 96 % of lipid content together with a 229 % increase in PA. The turnover of molecular species from PG and MGDG to PA indicated that submergence-induced lipid changes occurred through PA-mediated degradation. In addition, molecular species of extraplastidic PG degraded sooner than plastidic ones, lyso-phospholipids exhibited various patterns of change, and the double-bond index (DBI) remained unchanged until membrane deterioration. Our results revealed the unique changes of <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> upon submergence and suggested that the major cause of the massive lipid degradation could be anoxia...|$|R

The results show a marked decrease in microviscosity of cellular <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> in both intact lymphocytes and isolated cellular plasma membranes obtained from leukemic patients in clinical relapse as compared to intact lymphocytes and isolated cellular plasma membranes obtained from normal donors and leukemic patients in complete clinical remission. Concomitant to these dynamic changes in cellular <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids,</b> the degree of microviscosity of lipids in the blood serum of leukemic patients in clinical relapse is markedly reduced as compared to serum obtained from normal donors and leukemic patients in complete clinical remission. Moreover, an in vitro incubation of leukemic lymphocytes with normal low density lipoproteins results in an increased microviscosity of cellular <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids.</b> In addition to the interrelation between cellular <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> and serum lipoproteins, plasma membrane vesicles {{with a high degree}} of lipid microviscosity were isolated from the blood serum and pleural effusion of leukemic patients in clinical relapse.

40|$|Lipids of minced or {{comminuted}} muscle {{foods are}} particularly susceptible to oxidative deterioration. As a result, antioxidants {{are added to}} these products to retard the undesirable changes accompanying oxidation. The efficiency of an added antioxidant is related to its particular location within the product. Thus, directing the added antioxidant to the site where oxidation is initiated and/or propagated is of significant importance. The partitioning of δ-tocopherol between the neutraland the polar lipids of chicken leg muscles was investigated. The two lipid fractions were separated using differential ultracentrifugation techniques. Neutral lipids were obtained after high speed centrifugation of the minced muscle at 130, 000 g for 30 min. The polar <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> were collected from a muscle-buffer homogenate (pH 7. 5) between 10, 000 g for 20 min and 130, 000 g for 30 min. ^ The neutral oil collected represented from 11 to 90 % of the to triacylglycerols of the minced muscle. The polar <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> represented from 25 to 35 % of the total <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> of the muscle. The partitioning of δ-tocopherol between the two lipid fractions depended {{on the amount of}} tocopherol added. At low total lipid contents the added δ-tocopherol was present in approximately the same concentration in both muscle lipid fractions. At higher total lipid contents the δ-tocopherol concentration in the <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> increased relative to the neutral lipids. ^ The δ-tocopherol uptake by the <b>lipids</b> of the <b>membranes</b> suspended in buffer increased linearly with tocopherol concentration added in the range of 4 to 4, 000 ppm δ-tocopherol on a <b>lipid</b> basis. The <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> contained up to 50 % of the added tocopherol. This indicates a high capacity of the membranes for tocopherol incorporation or binding. Studies with model systems consisting of suspended <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> and chicken oil suggested an insignificant exchange of δ-tocopherol between the two lipid fractions when the tocopherol was initially residing in either fraction. This may be due to strong hydrophobic interactions between the antioxidant and the lipids in which it resides. An insignificant uptake of δ-tocopherol by the <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> was also observed when the tocopherol was added in corn oil to a model membrane lipid-chicken oil system. In contrast, when δ-tocopherol was added to the model system dissolved in ethanol the uptake of the <b>membrane</b> <b>lipids</b> increased dramatically. ^ It is proposed that the partitioning of tocopherol between the different lipids of a minced muscle is governed mainly by the relative surface areas of the lipids and the tocopherol concentration in the aqueous phase immediately after its addition. For this purpose the polarity of the tocopherol carrier (solvent) is of particular importance. ...|$|R
