500|$|His Band and the Street Choir was as well {{received}} as Morrison's previous album, Moondance, peaking at number 32 on the Billboard 200 and number 18 on the UK Album Chart. It owes its success {{mainly to the}} US Top Ten single [...] "Domino", which was released before the album and surpassed Morrison's 1967 hit, [...] "Brown Eyed Girl". As of 2010, [...] "Domino" [...] remains the most successful single of Morrison's solo career. Two other singles were released from the album, [...] "Blue Money" [...] and [...] "Call <b>Me</b> <b>Up</b> <b>in</b> Dreamland"; although less successful, they still managed to reach the Billboard Hot 100.|$|E
500|$|The British POWs {{provided}} the Americans with necessary advice regarding the camp life and shared rations and clothing {{sent by the}} British Red Cross. The British, {{who were in the}} process of digging an escape tunnel, requested help from the Americans. Juskalian would later describe the operation: [...] "I volunteered, although I have had claustrophobia ever since a boyhood friend shut <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a wood bin for a prank. When I look back at it, I wonder how I did it. Some nights when I think about it, I break out in a cold sweat. Somehow, I was able to summon up the will to do it. The tunnel was already some 80 to 100feet long. It extended underground beyond the barbed wire fence, but those in charge wanted to lengthen it so that the opening would come out below ground level on the steep side near the bank of the Fulda River. In that way when the tunnel was broken open, the escapees could not be seen by the guards in the towers." ...|$|E
500|$|His Band and the Street Choir {{peaked at}} number 32 on the Billboard 200, and at number 18 on the UK Album Chart. The album {{received}} a warm reception in North America—as Moondance had done—largely {{due to the}} success of [...] "Domino", a sampler single that peaked at number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100. This single remains Morrison's biggest US hit (as of 2010), as it climbed one place higher than his 1967 hit [...] "Brown Eyed Girl", from the album Blowin' Your Mind!. [...] "Domino" [...] was also a hit in the Netherlands, reaching number 22 on the Dutch Top 40. Jon Landau of Rolling Stone magazine attributed the success of [...] "Domino" [...] to the guitar figure {{at the beginning of the}} track, which he considered [...] "not only a great way to start a single, but a fine way to begin the album". [...] "Blue Money" [...] debuted as the second single, faltering outside the Top 20 at number 23 in the US. The final single, [...] "Call <b>Me</b> <b>Up</b> <b>in</b> Dreamland", managed only two weeks on the Billboard Hot 100, while reaching number 95; biographer Ken Brooks believed it deserved better. John Platania recalled that Morrison [...] "had designs" [...] on securing radio airplay for Street Choir, and the success of its singles reflected a growing audience and commercial appeal for his music.|$|E

2500|$|Norfolk's {{marriage}} to his second wife, Lady Elizabeth Stafford, which {{had apparently been}} mutually affectionate at first, deteriorated in 1527 {{when he took a}} mistress, Elizabeth Holland (d. 1547/8), whom he installed in the Howard household. Lady Elizabeth formally separated from her husband in the 1530s. She claimed that in March 1534, the Duke ‘locked <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a chamber, [...] took away my jewels and apparel'. Norfolk then moved her to Redbourn, Hertfordshire, where she lived an actual prisoner with a meagre annual allowance of only £200. She also claimed to have been physically maltreated by Norfolk and by his household servants.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the release}} of their second studio album Hook <b>Me</b> <b>Up</b> <b>in</b> 2007, The Veronicas gained success with their first Australian number-one hit [...] "Hook Me Up" [...] and their global {{breakthrough}} song [...] "Untouched". To support the album, the duo embarked on two tours: the Australian Hook Me Up Tour and their global Revenge Is Sweeter Tour in 2007 and 2009, respectively. Once touring had ended in 2010 they had enough of promoting the album and were [...] "ready to move on." [...] Feeling {{a sense of loss}} of identity and a need to rediscover themselves Jessica and Lisa decided to part ways temporarily. When they reconnected during 2010, Jessica and Lisa collaborated with Butch Vig, Nellee Hooper, Daniel Johns and long time collaborator Toby Gad to begin work on their third album.|$|E
2500|$|Stuart's last {{obstacle}} was Custer, {{with four}} hundred veteran troopers of the First Michigan Cavalry, directly in his path. Outnumbered but undaunted, Custer rode {{to the head}} of the regiment, [...] "drew his saber, threw off his hat so they could see his long yellow hair" [...] and shouted... "Come on, you Wolverines!" [...] Custer formed his men in line of battle and charged. [...] "So sudden was the collision that many of the horses were turned end over end and crushed their riders beneath them...." [...] As the Confederate advance stopped, their right flank was struck by troopers of the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Michigan. McIntosh was able to gather some of his men from the First New Jersey and Third Pennsylvania and charged the rebel left flank. [...] "Seeing that the situation was becoming critical, I [...] turned to [...] and said: [...] "I have been ordered to hold this position, but, if you will back <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> case I am court-martialed for disobedience, I will order a charge." [...] The rebel column disintegrated into individual saber and pistol fights.|$|E
2500|$|However, the {{situation}} unfolded differently. Wallace-Johnson {{was told by}} the proprietor of the African Morning Post that the police commissioner needed to see him as soon as possible. Wallace-Johnson suspected that he was being trapped, so he refused to go. He decided that he would rather travel to Freetown before making his own plans to sail to England. However, this proposal was rejected by the government. Kojo Thompson then came to his house and informed him that the governor had withdrawn his deal and now wanted Wallace-Johnson to stand trial. The activist claimed that the [...] "whole arrangement was a hoax and a dastard conspiracy to round <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a more serious charge" [...] and suspected that Thompson was somehow involved in the plot. Wallace-Johnson was put on trial in front of the Assize Court in July and quickly convicted and fined £50. Not all was lost for Wallace-Johnson—the publicity received by the trial helped increase WAYL membership by more than 1,500. In an anticipation of a guilt verdict, Wallace-Johnson and the WAYL began preparing for his appeal to England's Privy Council and hoped to obtain an English barrister to handle the case. The league asked their members to contribute five shillings to the appeal, but even then, the cost was far too great for the league to finance. After learning that the cost of taking a case to the Privy Council was approximately 1,000 pounds, Wallace-Johnson immediately suspected that Gold Coast authorities had known that the cost of appeal would place the league in financial ruin.|$|E
