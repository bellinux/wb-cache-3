40|$|The new {{approach}} for creation of film reflecting holographic <b>marks</b> <b>for</b> optical security is proposed. Such marks are replicas of a reflecting master hologram recorded on a chalcogenide glass layer. To receive the master hologram, the joint power spectrum of a reference phase mask and an input phase mask or a transformed phase mask is produced at {{the plane of}} the hologram writing and is modulated by an inclined laser beam. If an inclined laser beam illuminates the replica recorded on a flexible substrate, phase noise including speckle noise is eliminated because the hologram carrier frequency exceeds greatly the limiting frequency of the phase noise power spectrum. Experimental results have shown the principal possibility to produce the high performance film reflecting holographic <b>marks</b> <b>for</b> security <b>applications.</b> The proposed approach can be combined with technologies for fabrication of rainbow holograms. In this case, the received rainbow holograms are the reflecting holographic marks simultaneously.

40|$|AbstractFiber lasers {{are widely}} used in {{industry}} <b>for</b> various <b>applications.</b> <b>For</b> <b>marking</b> <b>applications</b> the most common types are pulsed fiber lasers with low average power (10 – 20  W), pulse lengths of 100  ns and pulse energy in 0, 5 - 1  mJ range. However <b>for</b> <b>applications</b> of high speed ablations and cleaning of surfaces higher average power and pulse energy is needed to realize shorter production cycle times. For this purpose pulsed fiber lasers with morehockey 17  h than 500  W average power and 50  mJ pulse energy {{have been developed to}} realize economic processes. In the long pulse range (μs to ms pulse length) QCW fiber lasers have been introduced that fulfil the demands of high pulse energy (up to 60  J) at lower average power (few 100  W range). These lasers fulfil the requirements that so far only lamp pumped Nd:YAG-lasers have been realized: high peak power and pulse energy with low average power in order to reduce investment costs for such devices. This presentation describes the latest development of such pulsed fiber lasers and their industrial applications and focuses in more details on drilling applications...|$|R
40|$|A Q-switched all-fiber laser {{application}} {{based on}} a novel micro-optical waveguide (MOW) on micro-actuating platform (MAP) light modulator is presented. A fused biconical taper (FBT) coupler acts as MOW, mounted on an electromechanical system, MAP, where an axial stress over the waist of FBT coupler is precisely controlled. The axial stress induced refractive index changes caused the coupling efficiency to result in modulation of optical power. The light modulator was implemented in a laser cavity as a Q-switching element. Q-switching of Yb 3 +-doped fiber laser was successfully achieved with the peak power of 192 mW at 4. 1 W pump power and 699 mW at 5. 2 W at the repetition rate of 18. 6 kHz. Further optimization of switching speed and modulation depth could improve the pulse extraction efficiency and the proposed structure can be readily applied in all-fiber Q-switching laser systems <b>for</b> <b>marking</b> <b>applications...</b>|$|R

Anita's so-called homeless mate Machteld Steens (who was taken to the youth-refuge as revenge on Anita's stepmother-to-be) felt that Dian should be taught a lesson and staged a burglary on March 6, 1992. Dian was overpowered by one of Machteld's sideman but ended up accepting Anita's apologies. Soon afterwards she began a relationship with Mark de Moor, an attractive swimmer she met on a spa weekend with her feminist aunt Sandra. During this period Karin was dating builder Jan-Henk Gerritse; it did not last but it did make her realise what a shambles her marriage was. On April 10, 1992, she left. Dian was broken-hearted and with Jef failing to comfort her she made an ill-fated effort to run away with Mark.
