40|$|The {{complete}} genome {{sequence of}} the Australian 1 - 2 heat-tolerant Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccine (<b>master</b> <b>seed</b> stocks) was determined and compared to the {{sequence of the}} parent virus from which it had been derived after exposure of the parent stock at 56 degrees C for 30 min. Nucleotide changes were observed {{at a number of}} positions with synonymous mutations being greater than those observed for non-synonymous mutations. Sequence data for the HN gene of a parental culture of V 4 and two heat-tolerant variants of V 4 were obtained. These were compared with the data for the 1 - 2 viruses and with published sequences for parental V 4 and for a number of ND vaccine strains. Sequence analyses did not reveal the ARG 303 deletion in the HN protein, previously claimed to be responsible for the thermostable phenotype. No consistent changes were detected that would indicate involvement of the HN protein in heat resistance. The majority of alterations were observed in the L protein of the virus and it is proposed that these alterations were responsible for the heat-tolerant phenotype of the 1 - 2 NDV vaccine.

These viruses, containing the pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E) genes of dengue serotypes 1 – 4 in the replicative background of the attenuated dengue- 2 PDK- 53 vaccine virus candidate, were manufactured under cGMP. Methodology/Principal Findings: After deriving vaccine viruses from RNA-transfected Vero cells, six plaque-purified viruses for each serotype were produced. The plaque-purified strains were then analyzed to select one stock for generation of the <b>master</b> <b>seed.</b> Full genetic and phenotypic characterizations of the master virus seeds were conducted to ensure these viruses retained the previously identified attenuating determinants and phenotypes of the vaccine viruses.

40|$|I- 2 is an avirulent {{strain of}} Newcastle disease virus. During {{establishment}} of the I- 2 strain master vaccine seed, a series of selection procedures was carried out at 56 degrees C {{in order to enhance}} heat resistance. This <b>master</b> <b>seed</b> is used to produce a working seed, which is then employed to produce the vaccine. These two passages are done without further heat selection; however, it is not known how rapidly and to what extent thermostable variants would be lost during further passage. The study was therefore conducted to determine the effect of passage on thermostability of strain I- 2. The virus was serially passaged and at various passage levels samples were subjected to heat treatment at 56 degrees C for 120 min. The inactivation rates for infectivity and haemagglutinin (HA) titres were assayed by use of chicken embryonated eggs and HA test, respectively. Thermostability of HA and infectivity of I- 2 virus were reduced after 10 and 5 passages, respectively, without heat selection at 56 degrees C. These results suggest that 5 more passages could be carried out between the working seed and vaccine levels without excessive loss of thermostability.

40|$|Abstract: Village poultry play a {{vital role}} in many poor rural households. They provide scarce animal protein (in the form of meat and eggs) and can be sold/bartered to meet {{essential}} family needs such as medicine, clothes and school fees. They also provide manure and pest control as well as being used in traditional ceremonies. Village poultry are generally owned and managed by women and children and improving their production can provide the first step out of poverty for the rural poor. The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) has supported village poultry research in many countries since 1984. This research has had some significant outcomes including: the control of Newcastle disease (ND) using Australian derived live thermotolerant vaccines in a variety of poultry production systems in several countries; description and quantification of the scavenging feed resource base of low input/low output systems; development of gender-sensitive extension materials and methodologies suitable for use in remote rural areas in Asia and Africa; and the development and registration of a new duck plague vaccine in Viet Nam. The thermotolerant ND I- 2 vaccine remains viable for periods away from the cold chain, can be administered by various routes and induces an acceptable level of protection under village conditions.

40|$|Clostridium difficile is a {{major cause}} of {{antibiotic}} induced diarrhoea worldwide, responsible for significant annual mortalities and represents a considerable economic burden on healthcare systems. The two main C. difficile virulence factors are toxins A and B. Isogenic toxin B mutants of two independently isolated erythromycin-sensitive derivatives (630 E and 630 Δerm) of strain 630 were previously shown to exhibit substantively different phenotypes. Compared to 630, strain 630 E and its progeny grow slower, achieve lower final cell densities, exhibit a reduced capacity for spore-formation, produce lower levels of toxin and are less virulent in the hamster infection model. By the same measures, strain 630 Δerm and its derivatives more closely mirror the behaviour of 630. Genome sequencing revealed that 630 Δerm had acquired seven unique Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) compared to 630 and 630 E, while 630 E had nine SNPs and a DNA inversion not found in the other two strains. The relatively large number of mutations meant that the identification of those responsible for the altered properties of 630 E was not possible, despite the restoration of three mutations to wildtype by allelic exchange and comparative RNAseq analysis of all three strains. The latter analysis revealed large differences in gene expression between the three strains, explaining in part why no single SNP could restore the phenotypic differences. Our findings suggest that strain 630 Δerm should be favoured over 630 E as a surrogate for 630 in genetic-based studies. They also underline the importance of effective strain curation and the need to genome re-sequence <b>master</b> <b>seed</b> banks wherever possible...|$|E
