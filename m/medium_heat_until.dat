2500|$|In Indonesian cuisine, {{which is}} similar to Malay, the term kecap refers to {{fermented}} savory sauces. Two main types are well known in their cuisine: kecap asin which translates to 'salty kecap' in Indonesian (a salty soy sauce) and kecap manis or literally [...] "sweet kecap" [...] in Indonesian. Kecap manis is a sweet soy sauce that is a mixture of soy sauce with brown sugar, molasses, garlic, ginger, anise, coriander and a bay leaf reduced over <b>medium</b> <b>heat</b> <b>until</b> rather syrupy. A third type, kecap ikan, meaning [...] "fish kecap" [...] is fish sauce similar to the Thai nam pla or the Philippine patis. It is not, however, soy-based.|$|E

50|$|Tocino is {{traditionally}} {{boiled in water}} (just {{enough to cover the}} meat) or fried in oil, or is cooked over <b>medium</b> <b>heat</b> <b>until</b> the fat is rendered. The original tocino is marinated only with salt, sugar, and salitre (saltpetre), although pineapple juice may be added for a slightly tart flavor. The Kapampangans who make tocino mix it for four to six hours in order to achieve thickness and softness in the meat, then leave it overnight at room temperature before serving it as burong babi (fermented pork).|$|E
40|$|Solid state laser {{technology}} is a very well developed field and numerous embodiments and modes of operation have been demonstrated. A more recent development has been the pumping of a solid state laser active medium {{with an array of}} diode lasers (diode pumping, for short). These diode pump packages have previously been developed to pump solid state lasers with good efficiency, but low average power. This invention is a method and the resulting apparatus for operating a solid state laser in the heat capacity mode. Instead of cooling the laser, the active <b>medium</b> will <b>heat</b> up <b>until</b> it reaches some maximum acceptable temperature. The waste heat is stored in the active medium itself...|$|R

Flatten it and with a bigger round object (a mug, for instance) cut out the round pieces approximately 10-20 cm in diameter. Then turn up {{the edges of the}} pieces of dough (1 cm). Place the prepared dough pads on an oiled baking pan and fill them with a thin layer of the potato filling and then put the thicker layer of the carrot filling on the potato paste.Bake the pies in the <b>medium</b> <b>heated</b> baking oven <b>until</b> the dough becomes dry and the carrot filling grows light brown. Serve with milk and honey or with skābputra (a fermented milk-and-barley porridge).|$|R

50|$|As {{the sweet}} {{used to be}} {{homemade}} there exist many variations on the recipe on how to prepare and present the leche frita. All of them have in common that they simmer the milk with sugar, cinnamon sticks and sometimes lemon zest. In a bowl, flour, sugar and egg yolks are mixed and the sugar milk is poured in The mixture is stirred until everything is well combined. This concoction is then cooked at <b>medium</b> <b>heat</b> <b>until</b> it thickens. The generated dough can now be moulded into round, rectangular or rhombical shapes, rolled in stirred eggs, covered with flour and then be fried. Before they are served they are glazed with sugar and sprinkled with cinnamon.|$|E
50|$|The {{ingredients}} {{often include}} butter or margarine, molasses, sugar, and sometimes white vinegar. The molasses {{is the critical}} ingredient, for it is less sweet than sugar and has a slightly bitter flavour that gives bonfire toffee its unique taste. One recipe calls for 230 g of butter, 230 g of treacle, and 450 g of brown sugar. The mixture is cooked over <b>medium</b> <b>heat</b> <b>until</b> melted, and allowed to boil (while constantly stirring rapidly) for 15 minutes. The hot mixture is then poured into buttered forms (such as a cake pan or special forms). Recipes calling {{for the use of}} vinegar vary these ingredients. For example, one recipe from 1922 calls for 550 g of dark brown sugar, 280 ml of molasses, one tablespoon (15 ml) of vinegar, one tablespoon (15 ml) of butter, and one teaspoon (5 ml) of sodium bicarbonate (or baking soda). White vinegar gives the toffee a slightly sharper taste, and alters the chemistry of the toffee so that it is not so brittle. It also helps the toffee to set. Other recipes call for about 5 imppt L of water, and vary the amount of the other ingredients. Some recipes call for the use of golden syrup (In the US this is light molasses mixed with corn syrup) instead of molasses/treacle.|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} Figure 7, the {{calculated}} and experimental values keep good agreement at low and <b>medium</b> <b>heat</b> flux. Then the deviation gradually increases. This {{is because the}} heat transfer mode in the evaporator of the thermosyphon {{is similar to the}} pool boiling heat transfer at low and <b>medium</b> <b>heat</b> flux, but dry-out area on the heated surface will appear and it increases gradually with increasing the heat flux, leading to the deviation of the present study with the pool boiling heat transfer. With the increase of the dry-out area, the HTC flattens and finally decreases till the dry-out limit happens. Therefore, Equation 6 fails to predict the HTC at high heat flux.|$|R

40|$|Summary- Ras cheese {{was made}} by the {{traditional}} process from fresh cow's milk and different recom-bined milks. The recombined milks were prepared by mixing recombined cream (20 % fat) with recon-stituted skimmilks obtained from classicallow <b>heat</b> and <b>medium</b> <b>heat</b> powders, the latter one added or not with calcium caseinate and also from a new milk powder recently developed under an INRA paten-ted process using membrane microfiltration. Milks, wheys and fresh cheeses were carefully analyzed in order to determine reliable weight and cheese component recoveries. Organoleptic qualities deter-mined through f 1 avour, body and texture scorings were assessed during the 3 -month ripening period. The highest weight cheese yields were evidently observed with recombined milks enriched with-ealclum caseinate and the lowest with recombined milk made from <b>medium</b> <b>heat</b> powder. 8 atisfactory weight cheese yield and milk component recoveries were achieved with INRA powder recombined milk; they were even higher than those of fresh milk. The ripening changes in composition and in ripening indexes were almost the same in cheeses from different milks. Ras cheese from fresh milk showed the best qua-litY followed by that made with INRA milk powder while that made from <b>medium</b> <b>heat</b> milk powder showed the poorest quality.
