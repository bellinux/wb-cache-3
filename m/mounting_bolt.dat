40|$|Evidences {{suggest that}} the TGB had moved from its {{position}} by fracturing the <b>mounting</b> <b>bolts.</b> As a result, the tail rotor blades have hit the TRG causing fracturing of both TRG and TRBs. The most probable reason for failure of the TGB <b>mounting</b> <b>bolts</b> appears to be excessive load on the TGB due to some abnormalities in the tail rotor blades. However, with the available evidences, {{the nature of the}} problem on the tail rotor blades could not be identified. Hence it is necessary to establish the reason for the abnormal sound in the helicopter prior to the accident and also to ascertain whether or not the same could cause excessive load on the TGB. The damages seen in the input side of the TGB, which includes TDS, floating bearing, bearing support assembly and the couplings are secondary in nature and might have occurred after failure of the TGB <b>mounting</b> <b>bolts.</b> There were no evidences of delayed failure such as fatigue in any of the components examined...|$|R

50|$|The {{frame was}} made stiffer through the {{enlarging}} {{of the front}} engine <b>mounting</b> <b>bolts,</b> though this still left the ZX-9R with just a single front engine mount {{on either side of}} the frame.

40|$|Two <b>mounting</b> <b>bolts</b> {{pertaining}} to different accessory gearboxes {{were sent to}} the laboratory for analyzing the cause of failure. Investigation revealed that both the bolts have failed by fatigue; one under bending and the other under reverse bending. The fatigue cracks have initiated at the thread root in both the cases. No metallurgical and/or mechanical abnormalities were found responsible for the fatigue crack initiation and the fatigue was found to be stress related. Analysis showed that in one bolt, the fatigue crack initiation was accelerated due to bending stress resulting from the assembly stresses. In the other bolt, the reverse bending fatigue occurred during service due to high length to diameter ratio of the bolts. It appears that such failures in the present accessory gearbox mounting scheme is unavoidable. A detailed analysis of the failures has been presented in this report with a few recommendations for a possible improvement in the fatigue life of the <b>mounting</b> <b>bolts...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Almost all Quadrajets {{today have}} some amount of warpage of the {{castings}} although less {{pronounced in the}} so-called [...] "mod Quad" [...] versions after 1974 which were a bit heavier and better designed to resist warping. The root cause of this warpage is over-tightening the front two carburetor <b>mounting</b> <b>bolts,</b> often in combination with a base gasket that lacks hard nylon inserts for the bolt holes.|$|R
5000|$|A cymbal stack is a {{combination}} of two or more cymbals mounted in contact, producing a sound unlike any single cymbal. The effect is similar to a loosely closed hi-hat, or can alternatively be seen as an extreme case of a sizzle cymbal with the upper cymbal serving as a single large jangle. The exact effect is dependent on the tension on the <b>mounting</b> <b>bolt,</b> and with some combinations can be varied from a very short crunch to a much longer buzz.|$|E

5000|$|... 1958 - Bosses {{for side}} motor mounts {{were added to}} the block casting, {{utilized}} for production mounts for this and all future model years. However, the features for front motor mounts as used in 1955-1957 remained part of the block casting in this and future years. The 265-cubic-inch version of the engine was discontinued. Also, the cylinder head valve cover <b>mounting</b> <b>bolt</b> holes were changed from the top row staggered (relative to the bottom row of bolts) to the [...] "straight-across" [...] pattern that remained the way of identifying the early heads from the newer ones with a valve cover design which lasted until the 1987 center-bolt-style covers.|$|E
50|$|Later {{models were}} {{fitted with a}} bashplate between the lower frame downtubes (by frame number TB879).

50|$|Side-stand mounting:The side-stand <b>mount</b> <b>bolts</b> {{directly}} into the casting that forms the lower section of the left side crankcase. In {{the event of a}} hard impact on the side-stand a torsional load is passed to the crankcase which invariably fails. This potentially expensive weakness is frequently addressed by the fitting of an aftermarket side-stand relocating kit to remove the mount from the crankcase and place it directly to the frame.|$|R
50|$|When {{installed}} in the BMW E30, a two-piece oil pan with a removable front sump was fitted to the M42. In this two-piece arrangement, the upper oil pan casting incorporates the oil pump's supply passage, and is sealed to the crankcase oil filter housing with a paper gasket. This can cause problems, because thermal cycles and engine vibration tend to loosen the six 10mm upper pan <b>mounting</b> <b>bolts</b> inside the motor.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{but not all}} drummers put an {{additional}} felt between the bells of the two cymbals, to eliminate any direct contact between the cymbals and retain the tone of each. However the slight contact between the bells if the extra felt is not used affects the tone of each cymbal only subtly, and some drummers like the tonal connection that results. Beginners sometimes use this technique for another reason entirely: The <b>mounting</b> <b>bolt</b> may not be long enough to allow an extra felt, or they may simply not have bought a felt when buying their first splash. Unfortunately, the metal to metal contact and the playing of the upturned splash rim both decrease {{the life of the}} cymbal, particularly {{at the hands of a}} beginner.|$|E
40|$|During the {{prototype}} vibration {{tests of the}} GAS adapter beam, significant impacting of the beam at its support points was observed. The cause of the impacting was traced to gaps under the <b>mounting</b> <b>bolt</b> heads. Because of the nonlinear nature of the response, {{it was difficult to}} evaluate the effects which Shuttle launch dynamics might have on the <b>mounting</b> <b>bolt</b> loads. A series of tests were conducted on an electrodynamic exciter in which the transient acceleration time histories, which had been measured during the Space Transportation System- 1 (STS- 1; Space Shuttle mission 1) launch, were simulated. The actual flight data had to be filtered and compensated so that it could be reproduced on the shaker without exceeding displacement and velocity limitations. <b>Mounting</b> <b>bolt</b> loads were measured directly by strain gages applied to the bolts. Various gap thicknesses and bolt torques were investigated. Although increased gap thickness resulted in greater accelerations due to impacting, the bolt loads were not significantly affected. This is attributed to the fact that impacting excited mostly higher frequency modes which do not have significant modal mass...|$|E
40|$|The test {{sequence}} was to measure electric and magnetic fields induced inside a redesigned solid rocket motor case when a simulated lightning discharge strikes an exposed top hat cover simulator. The {{test sequence}} was conducted between 21 June and 17 July 1990. Thirty-six high rate-of-rise Marx generator discharges and eight high current bank discharges were injected onto three different test article configurations. Attach points included three locations {{on the top}} hat cover simulator and two locations on the mounting bolts. Top hat cover simulator and <b>mounting</b> <b>bolt</b> damage and grain cover damage was observed. Overall electric field levels were well below 30 kilowatts/meter. Electric field levels ranged from 184. 7 to 345. 9 volts/meter and magnetic field levels were calculated from 6. 921 to 39. 73 amperes/meter.
