40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was to deduct the {{composition}} for recycled multilayer film plastic waste and {{how it could be}} compatibilized in theory. The composition analysis was carried out using three different methods: differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and polarized light optical microscopy. Recycled <b>multilayer</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> samples were provided by Arcada University of applied sciences after initial screening. FTIR and optical microscopy were used on all samples. Some samples had their materials written on the packages. DSC was used only on samples with unknown material composition. Optical microscopy was used to produce cross-section images of the multi-layer films. Layer thicknesses and the number of layers were differentiated from these images. Different plastics exhibit various interference colors with polarized light, thus individual layers could be identified. Top and bottom layers were analyzed by FTIR and then cross-referenced with the data from the layer analysis. Analysis was carried out for 121 samples and 738 layers. This lead to the total thickness of each material used in the sample pool, which was used to further calculate the proportions of each material in relation to volume for different package types and the whole sample pool. The sample pool consisted of 56. 7 % polyethylene (PE), 13. 5 % of polypropylene (PP), 9. 5 % of polyamide- 6 (PA- 6), 7. 8 % of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), 4. 5 % of copolymers of PE and PP, 4. 1 % of print, 2. 0 % of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) or tie layers and of 1. 9 % ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH).

40|$|<b>Multilayer</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>films</b> {{provide a}} range of properties, which cannot be {{obtained}} from monolayer films but, at present, their recyclability is an open issue and should be improved. Research to date has shown {{the possibility of using}} whey protein as a layer material with the property of acting as an excellent barrier against oxygen and moisture, replacing petrochemical non-recyclable materials. The innovative approach of the present research was to achieve the recyclability of the substrate films by separating them, with a simple process compatible with industrial procedures, in order to promote recycling processes leading to obtain high value products that will beneficially impact the packaging and food industries. Hence, polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) /polyethylene (PE) multi-layer film was prepared based on PET coated with a whey protein layer, and then the previous structure was laminated with PE. Whey proteins, constituting the coating, can be degraded by enzymes so that the coating films can be washed off from the plastic substrate layer. Enzyme types, dosage, time, and temperature optima, which are compatible with procedures adopted in industrial waste recycling, were determined for a highly-efficient process. The washing of samples based on PET/whey and PET/whey/PE were efficient when performed with enzymatic detergent containing protease enzymes, as an alternative to conventional detergents used in recycling facilities. Different types of enzymatic detergents tested presented positive results in removing the protein layer from the PET substrate and from the PET/whey/PE multilayer films at room temperature. These results attested to the possibility of organizing the pre-treatment of the whey-based multilayer film by washing with different available commercial enzymatic detergents in order to separate PET and PE, thus allowing a better recycling of the two different polymers. Mechanical properties of the plastic substrate, such as stress at yield, stress and elongation at break, evaluated by tensile testing on films before and after cleaning, were are not significantly affected by washing with enzymatic detergents...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCoextrusion {{technologies}} {{are commonly used}} to produce multilayered composite sheets or films for a large range of applications from food packaging to optics. The contrast of rheological properties between layers can lead to interfacial instabilities during flow. Important theoretical and experimental advances regarding the stability of compatible and incompatible polymers have, during the last decades, been made using a mechanical approach. However, few research efforts have been dedicated to the physicochemical affinity between the neighboring layers. The present study deals with the influence of this affinity on interfacial instabilities for functionalized incompatible polymers. Polyamide (PA 6) /polyethylene grafted with glycidyl methacrylate (PE-GMA) {{was used as a}} reactive system and PE/PA 6 as a non reactive one. Two grades of polyamide (PA 6) were used in order to change the viscosity and elasticity ratios between PE (or PE-GMA) and PA 6. It was experimentally confirmed, in this case, that weak disturbance can be predicted by considering an interphase of non-zero thickness (corresponding to an interdiffusion/reaction zone) instead of a purely geometrical interface between the two reactive layers. According to rheological investigations from previous work, an experimental strategy was here formulated to optimize the process by listing the parameters that controlled the stability of the reactive <b>multilayer</b> flows. <b>Plastic</b> <b>films</b> with two layers were coextruded in symmetrical and asymmetrical configurations in which PA 6 was the middle layer. Indeed, for reactive multilayered systems, the interfacial flow instability could be reduced or eliminated, for instance, by (i) increasing the residence time or temperature in the coextrusion bloc (for T above the reaction temperature T[*]=[*] 240 °C), and (ii) reducing the total extrusion flow rate. The reaction rate/compatibilization played a major role that must be taken into account. Furthermore, the role of the viscosity ratio, elasticity ratio, and layer ratio of the stability of the interface were also investigated coupling to the physicochemical affinity. The results show {{that it is necessary to}} obtain links between the classic factors that are introduced in the evaluation of the theoretical, given by linear stability analysis/longwave asymptotic investigations, and its corresponding experimental stability charts. Hence, based on this analysis, guide-lines for a stable coextrusion of reactive functionalized polymers can be provided...|$|R

However, a series of problems such as pollution of <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> residue left in the field occur. It is required to make a reasonable assessment on film mulching and rationally utilize it. Based on its application, this study proposed a concept of crop safety period of <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> mulching, and its estimation methods. Crop safety period through <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> mulching means the appropriate choice of a photo-selective mulch film according to the transplant season, to the pedoclimatic conditions of the area under cultivation and, finally, to the type of crop. In the days before the transplant, the <b>plastic</b> mulching <b>film</b> should be basic whole, and it works to decrease soil moisture evaporation, to warm soil and to prevent weeds. Successively, these functions almost reduce. The selection of crop safety period of <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> mulching is helpful to manage agricultural activities efficiently; guiding film makers to produce both meet the demand of production and lower cost of plastic products; to help farmers due to the types of crop and production conditions choosing appropriate <b>plastic</b> mulch <b>film.</b> Based on measurement of function of <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> mulching, and crop canopy density, 2 kinds of method were established. The first one is to continuously monitor soil moisture，temperature and weed control, to build relationship between the function of soil temperature, moisture, weed suppression and mulching treatments, with that to seek the intersection of them. The coincidence point means functions disappear of plastic mulching and the days from starting mulching to this date is a certain crop safety period in a certain site. The second is crop canopy density to determine crop safety of <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> mulching period, which includes 2 steps: to measure the change of crop canopy density, and the functions (soil temperature and moisture etc.) of mulching under no mulching and mulching at same time, to establish the curve of crop canopy density and the main function of <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> in order to cross the best condition between crop canopy density and the contribute of mulch films aimed to the determination of the ideal crop safeguard period. All in all, <b>plastic</b> mulching <b>film</b> has been widely used in global, especially in China, in the past 30 years, and its application area and efficacy works better than any other agronomic practices.

25|$|One of {{the great}} {{advantages}} of <b>plastic</b> <b>films</b> for capacitor fabrication is that <b>plastic</b> <b>films</b> have considerably fewer defects than paper sheets used in paper capacitors. This allows the manufacture of <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> capacitors with only a single layer of <b>plastic</b> <b>film,</b> whereas paper capacitors need a double layer of paper. <b>Plastic</b> <b>film</b> capacitors were significantly smaller in physical size (better volumetric efficiency), with the same capacitance value and the same dielectric strength as comparable paper capacitors. Then-new plastic materials also showed further advantages compared with paper. Plastic is much less hygroscopic than paper, reducing the deleterious effects of imperfect sealing. Additionally, most plastics are subject to fewer chemical changes over long periods, providing long-term stability of their electrical parameters. Since around 1980, paper and metallized paper capacitors (MP capacitors) have almost completely been replaced by PET film capacitors for most low-power DC electronic applications. Paper is now used only in RFI suppression or motor run capacitors, or as a mixed dielectric combined with polypropylene films in large AC and DC capacitors for high-power applications.|$|R
