5|$|After World War II ended, the U.S. Navy {{entered the}} 45 year long Cold War {{and participated in}} the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the First Persian Gulf War, and the Second Persian Gulf War / Iraq War. Following the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in 1990-91, the Soviet Red Navy fell apart, which made the United States the world's undisputed naval superpower. Nuclear power and ballistic <b>missile</b> <b>technology</b> led to new ship propulsion and weapon systems, which were used in the s and s. By 1978, the number of ships had dwindled to less than 400, many of which were from World War II, which prompted Ronald Reagan to institute a program for a modern, 600-ship Navy. Today, the United States is the world's undisputed naval superpower, with the ability to engage and project power in two simultaneous limited wars along separate fronts.|$|E

25|$|North Korea's {{ability to}} deliver weapons of mass {{destruction}} to a hypothetical target is somewhat limited by its <b>missile</b> <b>technology.</b> In 2005, North Korea's total range with its Nodong missiles was estimated as 900km with a 1,000kg payload.

25|$|The first {{prototype}} {{was under}} construction when the minister, Duncan Sandys, announced {{the decision to}} cancel its development in 1957.

The Bristol 188 project continued despite the cancellation of the 730. Aspects and influences of the Avro 730 encouraged studies at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, into supersonic transport aircraft, which in turn eventually contributed to the development effort behind Concorde.|$|E

25|$|Iran {{possesses}} {{the technology to}} launch superfast anti-submarine rockets that can travel {{at the speed of}} 100 meters per second under water, making the country second only to Russia in possessing the technology. Iran is among the five countries in the world to have developed ammunitions with laser targeting technology. Iran is among the few countries that possess the technological know-how of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) fitted with scanning and reconnaissance systems. Iran is among the 12 countries with <b>missile</b> <b>technology</b> and advanced mobile air defense systems. Over the past years, Iran has made important breakthroughs in its defense sector and attained self-sufficiency in producing important military equipment and systems. Since 1992, it also has produced its own tanks, armored personnel carriers, sophisticated radars, guided missiles, a submarine, and fighter planes.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the armed, low altitude operation, tactical FR.9 variant, Gloster also developed the PR.10 for high altitude missions. The first prototype flew on 29 March 1950 and was actually converted into the first production aircraft. Based on the F.4, it had the F.4-style tail and the longer wings of the earlier variant. All the cannons were removed and a single camera placed in the nose with two more in the rear fuselage; the canopy was also changed. The PR.10 was delivered to the RAF in December 1950 and were given to No. 2 and No. 541 squadrons in Germany and No. 13 Squadron RAF in Cyprus. The PR.10 was rapidly phased out from 1956; rapid improvements in surface-to-air <b>missile</b> <b>technology</b> {{and the introduction of}} newer aircraft capable of flying at greater altitudes and speeds had rendered the aircraft obsolete.|$|E
25|$|India {{has been}} pushing for reforms in the UN and WTO with mixed results.

The US argued that India's strong nuclear non-proliferation record made it an exception, however this has not persuaded other Nuclear Suppliers Group members to sign similar deals with India.

50|$|Since {{the advent}} of {{practical}} anti-ship <b>missiles</b> <b>technology,</b> aerial torpedoes have largely been reduced to use in anti-submarine warfare.

Some modern aerial anti-submarine torpedoes do have the necessary guidance capability to engage surface vessels, though given the widespread availability of missiles on aircraft and the small, specialized warhead on anti-submarine aerial torpedoes, this is not an option normally considered.|$|R
25|$|Indo-Italian relations, {{although}} historically cordial, {{have gone}} into a steep downward trend {{to the point of}} becoming publicly contentious.

25|$|The missile {{had been}} an ever-evolving {{component}} of PLAN weaponry since the late 1960s. The Soviet Union's assistance to Chinese military developments included the SS-N-2 Styx anti-ship <b>missile</b> <b>technology.</b> Since the 1960s, China has manufactured its own models of anti-ship missile based on the SS-N-2 Styx, {{in the form of}} HY-1, SY-1, SY-2, and other airborne and ground-launched systems. The oldest designs have since been phased out, but late variants remain in service. The fundamental shortcoming of missiles based on the SS-N-2 Styx are being short-ranged (only 40â€“100km), slow, low in agility, and is rather large and easily detectable targets for modern SAM and CIWS. Later Chinese variants have vastly superior electronics, radar guidance and performance to the older Soviet models. As China has normalized its relationship with the former Soviet Union and then Russia, the importation of Russian missiles resumed, and a new generation of Russian anti-ship missiles have been imported, including the supersonic SS-N-22 and Kh-31, Klub-S, (the Russian equivalent of the anti-shipping version of American BGM-109 Tomahawk), and AS-20 Uran (the Russian equivalent of the air-launched American AGM-84 anti-shipping Harpoon missile).|$|E
