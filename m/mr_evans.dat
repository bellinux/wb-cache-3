5|$|At {{work one}} morning, Danny rescues Ronnie (Jones) from her abusive date. After a taxi ride to Danny's high school, Ronnie kisses him. Danny {{responds}} to witnessing schoolmates' teasing by kissing Ronnie {{back and then}} punching {{one of them in}} the face when he makes a teasing remark. Danny's reaction summons him to the principal's office; where Miss Pearson (Helene Hatch), his teacher, tells Principal Evans (Raymond Bailey) that Danny will not graduate because of his poor attitude. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Evans</b> is sympathetic, but powerless to help; so Danny decides {{to drop out of school}} to find work, against the wishes of his father, who tries to convince Danny to stay in school.|$|E

6000|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Evan</b> {{had been}} {{standing}} before them with a composure which impressed Mrs. Carroll with a belief in his gentle blood, for she remembered her own fussy, plebeian husband, whose fortune {{had never been able}} to purchase him the manners of a gentleman. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Evan</b> only grew a little more erect, as he replied, with an untroubled mien,-- ...|$|R
2500|$|Gladys Hunt, in Read for Your Life, gives two themes for the book. The first {{speaks of}} the {{possibility}} of magical happenings in the real world. Though Jenny at first refuses to imagine that Peter's talk of visions could be true, other characters are not so certain. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Evans</b> the farmer maintains that there are [...] "things as can't be explained", despite the skepticism of his family. Later in the story Jenny visits Professor Rhys and tells him about Peter's visions, hoping he will give her a reasonable explanation for them. Instead he shocks her by admitting he believes magical occurrences are possible and superstitions may be rooted in facts, saying [...] "the more I learn the less I know... Why should there not be forces we do not understand?" [...] The second theme Hunt mentions is that people's lives form patterns, sometimes woven together so that the actions of one may affect another's, even centuries apart, as Peter returning Taliesin's key brings peace to both of them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is that so?" [...] asked Mrs. Harmon placidly, {{taking the}} ticket. [...] "Well, I'm ever so much obliged to you, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Evans.</b> <b>Mr.</b> <b>Evans,</b> Mr. Barker-- our new clerk," [...] she said, {{introducing}} them.|$|E

60|$|Miss Carver {{began to}} talk to him about the book, and then about <b>Mr.</b> <b>Evans.</b> She asked him if he went much to his rooms, and Lemuel said no, not at all, since the first time <b>Mr.</b> <b>Evans</b> had asked him up. He said, after a pause, that he did not know whether he wanted him to come.|$|E
60|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Evans</b> {{blew his}} whistle again--thoughtfully. The {{opportunity}} seemed {{too good to}} lose.|$|E
60|$|Every one was {{convinced}} that Cousin Henry had simply stolen the property; and was it to be endured that such a deed as {{that should have been}} done by such a man and that Carmarthen should not find it out? Mr Apjohn was very much praised for his energy in having forced the man to take his action against <b>Mr</b> <b>Evans,</b> and no one was more inclined to praise him than <b>Mr</b> <b>Evans</b> himself. Those who had seen the man did believe that the truth would be worked out of him; and those who had only heard of him were sure that the trial would be a time of intense interest in the borough. The sale of the newspaper had risen immensely, and <b>Mr</b> <b>Evans</b> was quite the leading man of the hour.|$|E

60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Evans,</b> on principle, {{objected to}} the use of the Deity's name out of church, {{thinking}} it a little blasphemous, but he said nothing.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Carter started, {{and gazed}} at her uneasily. The smile on her lip and the triumphant gleam in her eye were a revelation to him. He turned to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Evans</b> and in as calm a voice as he could assume, {{requested}} him to discharge the debt. Mr. Prout, his fingers twitching, stood waiting [...] "Well, it's your money," [...] said <b>Mr.</b> <b>Evans,</b> grudgingly extracting a purse from his trouser-pocket; [...] "and I suppose you ought to pay your debts; still----" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Evan</b> {{was more}} a man of deeds than words, {{therefore}} he disappeared at once with a mighty splash, and after repeated divings and much laughter appeared bearing the chief ornament of Mrs. Penelope Carroll's comely countenance. Debby looked very pretty and grateful as she returned her thanks, and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Evan</b> was guilty of a secret wish that all the worthy lady's features were {{at the bottom of}} the sea, that he might have the satisfaction of restoring them to her attractive niece; but curbing this unnatural desire, he bowed, saying, gravely,-- ...|$|R

50|$|Lord Denning MR {{held that}} <b>Mrs</b> <b>Evans</b> could assert {{her right to}} remain in the cottage against the Binions even though she had no legal or {{equitable}} property right as such.|$|R
6000|$|He {{came home}} at night glum and silent, the {{hardship}} {{of not being able}} to give <b>Mr.</b> <b>Evans</b> his deserts without incurring hard labour having weighed on his spirits all day. To avoid the annoyance of the piano next door, which was slowly and reluctantly yielding up [...] "The Last Rose of Summer" [...] note by note, he went out at the back, and the first thing he saw was <b>Mr.</b> <b>Evans</b> mending his path with tins and other bric-a-brac.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No doubt,' {{answered}} <b>Mr</b> <b>Evans,</b> slightly frowning. 'But obviously one isn't {{meant to}} do that to such an extent as to be dismissed from one's place.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Oh! don’t be afraid,’ said <b>Mr.</b> <b>Evans,</b> {{with a very}} self-satisfied air; ‘I shall {{fall with}} my head “off,” and then I can’t do any harm.’ ...|$|E
60|$|At this <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Evans</b> {{burst into}} a great passion of weeping, with her face buried in her hands, while Mistress Pamela still {{regarded}} me, though with a fixed and stony stare.|$|R
6000|$|... "It wasn't anything," [...] Lemuel interrupted. [...] "There wasn't {{the least}} danger; and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Evans</b> {{did it all}} herself, anyway. It made me sick {{to see how the}} papers had it. It's a shame!" ...|$|R
60|$|After which, {{the only}} thing which poor Eustace could do (especially as it was spoken loud enough for all bystanders), was to {{introduce}} in due form <b>Mr.</b> <b>Evan</b> Morgans and <b>Mr.</b> Morgan <b>Evans,</b> who, hearing the name, and, what was worse, seeing the terrible face with its quiet searching eye, felt like a brace of partridge-poults cowering in the stubble, with a hawk hanging ten feet over their heads.|$|R
6000|$|... "That’s all right, then," [...] said <b>Mr.</b> <b>Evans.</b> [...] "I shouldn’t {{like to be}} hard on a neighbour; {{not that}} we shall be {{neighbours}} much longer." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{hasten to}} let you know what took place at Eton to-day. I found that I did stand in some sort {{committed}} to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Evans,</b> though not so much so but that I could with perfect ease have declined to place Charley in his house if I had desired to do so. I must say, however, that after seeing Mr. Cookesley (a most excellent man in his way) and seeing <b>Mr.</b> <b>Evans,</b> and Mr. Evans's house, I think I should, under any circumstances, have given the latter the preference as to the domestic part of Charley's life. I would certainly prefer to try it. I therefore thought it best to propose to have Mr. Cookesley for his tutor, and to place him as a boarder with <b>Mr.</b> <b>Evans.</b> Both gentlemen seemed satisfied with this arrangement, and Dr. Hawtrey expressed his approval of it also.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wish you was!" [...] said <b>Mr.</b> <b>Evans,</b> who {{had been}} {{listening}} in open-mouthed astonishment. [...] "Look here! Man to man--are you Bert Simmons or are you not?" ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Mrs</b> Patricia (Trish) <b>Evans,</b> came to {{the school}} in 1992. Her vision for St Aidan's {{included}} formulating and implementing a strategic plan, and enhancing administrative staff and student access to improved technology. Within an educational tradition of 'Girls can do anything' and a strong Christian framework of caring {{for each other and}} the wider community, <b>Mrs</b> <b>Evans</b> ably led St Aidan's through change.|$|R
50|$|His {{books and}} manuscripts {{he left to}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Evans,</b> wife of the master of Pembroke, and she by a deed of gift dated 17 October 1889 gave them to the college on {{condition}} that they were preserved as a separate collection.|$|R
