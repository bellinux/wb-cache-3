40|$|The {{oxidation}} of {{manganese sulphate}} both chemically and electrolytically in presence of sulphuric acid to obtaili. different oxidation products of manganese is well known. The use of maI. ganoussulphate as a "carrier" in the electrolytic oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde {{has been reported}} Dy several erurlier workers. The <b>manganous</b> <b>sulphate</b> used in such experiments was in catalytic quantities. The manganic sulphate produced electrolytically from it was repo. rted {{to bring about the}} oxidation of toluene and the <b>manganous</b> <b>sulphate</b> formed in the reaction was eoxidised in the cell. Most of the work reported eaJrher was confined to studies of electrolytes containing man,gahese sulphate only in' solution Since it ill known that the solubility of manganous sulphatl is considerably reduced with increasing strength of sulphliric acid, it was considered useful to investigate systems in wl 1 ich the limitations arising from this could be overcome...|$|E

40|$|New {{approaches}} to the application of membranes {{for the production of}} potable water are constantly being sought after in anticipation of future demands for increasingly rigorous water quality standards and reduced environmental impact. A major limitation, however, is membrane fouling, which manifests itself as a continual reduction in flux over time and thus restricts the practical implementation to restore flux. Mechanical and chemical methods have been implemented to restore flux to ultrafiltration systems, but these either result in a break in the process operation or lead to membrane damage or additional pollution problems. This project was aimed to develop a 'defouling on demand' stategy for cleaning membranes used during brown water ultrafiltration. The process involves the use of activatable peroxidase enzymes, which were immobilised onto flat sheet polysulphone membranes. Following flux decline which reaches a critical level with the build-up of the foulant layer, the immobilised enzyme layer was activated by the addition of a chemical activator solution, in this case hydrogen peroxidase and <b>manganous</b> <b>sulphate.</b> Manganese peroxidase was found to be the most effective enzyme at alleviating fouling by degrading the foulant layer formed on the membrane surface and hence restored flux to the ultrafiltration system. A 93 % flux improvement was observed when manganese peroxidase was activated when 800 uM <b>manganous</b> <b>sulphate,</b> 100 mM hydrogen peroxide were added {{in the presence of a}} manganese chelator, lactate. The concept and the potential benefits this system holds will be discussed in further detail. ...|$|E

40|$|The susceptibilities and {{specific}} heats of various paramagnetic substances have been measured at temperatures between 20 Â°K and 0. 006 Â°K, {{and the results}} compared with theoretical predictions. In some cases the agreement between theory and experiment {{was found to be}} very good. Susceptibilities were measured by an a. c. method from the change of mutual inductance of a pair of coils surrounding the specimen, using a Hartshorn bridge. This involved the construction of an accurate decade inductometer which is described in full detail. Magnetic specific heats above 1 Â°K were measured in terms of the adiabatic and isothermal susceptibilities, from the ratio of which the specific heat at constant magnetisation can be calculated thermodynamically. These susceptibilities can be measured with the Hartshorn bridge using suitable audio frequencies. The method depends on the mechanism of spin lattice relaxation by means of which the magnetic ions can exchange energy with their surroundings. If the relaxation time is sufficiently long, then the susceptibility measured {{in the presence of a}} large field using the audio frequency method is equal to the adiabatic susceptibility. The isothermic susceptibility is equal to the susceptibility in zero external field for all measuring frequencies. The method measures only the specific heat of the assembly of paramagnetic ions and is independent of the lattice specific heat of the substance. Below 1 Â°K entropies and hence specific heats were measured by the method of adiabatic demagnetization in terms of the magnetic temperature TÂ°. This is defined as TÂ° = Î»/Ï where Ï is the susceptibility, and Î» is determined from measurements in the helium range. The dependence of TÂ° on the shape of the specimen is discussed. The susceptibility or oxygen trapped in a "clathrate" enclosure compound of Î² quinol was measured and the temperature variation between 20 Â°K and 1 Â°K compared with that of an assembly of free oxygen molecules as calculated from spectroscopic data. Almost perfect agreement was found down to 2 Â°K, indicating that the molecules are free to rotate within the cage of quinol. However, below about 2 Â°K a discrepancy was observed suggesting a "freezing in" of the rotation. fThis conclusion was supported by a second experiment on oxygen enrichced in O 16 O 18. The susceptibility of this "gas" at very low temperatures would be expected to differ from that of normal oxygen on the basis of free rotation, but no appreciable difference was found in the range 1 - 5 Â°K. The magnetic specific heat of Cerium Magnesium Nitrate was measured at 1 Â°K by the relaxation method and between 1 Â°K and 0. 006 Â°K by the method of adiabatic demagnetization. It was found that the specific heat is very small, being given in this range of temperatures by C M = 7. 3 x 10 - 6 R/T 2, and that it can be accounted for almost entirely by magnetic dipole-dipole interaction. The uses of the salt for work below 1 Â°K are discussed. Specific heat measurements by the relaxation method were also made on four other substances:- Cerium zinc nitrate. This was found to have very nearly the same properties as the magnesium salt, its susceptibility being exactly the same and its specific heat being given by C M = 6. 4 x 10 - 5 r/t 2. Neodymium magnesium nitrate. The specific heat of this salt was measured at 1 Â°K and found to be given by C M = 8. 73 x 10 - 4 R/T 2, in good agreement with the value calculated on the basis of magnetic dipole-dipole interaction plus the effect of hyperfine splittings. In view of the good agreement between theory and experiment at 1 Â°K, the theory will almost certainly hold down to temperatures of the order of 0. 01 Â°K where the interaction energy becomes comparable with kT. An expression for the deviation from Curie's law in the the temperature range 1 Â°K to 0. 05 Â°K is derived and the uses of the salt for work below 1 Â°K are discussed. Chromic methylamine alum. The value of the specific heat near 1 Â°K was found to be C M = 0. 019 2 R/T 2 in excellent agreement with the values derived from adiabatic demagnetization data. However, when compared with the value calculated from dipole-dipole interaction plus the effect of the Stark splittings it was found that there was a 12 % discrepancy. Possible explanations are discussed but the discrepancy remains unresolved. Ferric Rubidium alum. The value of the specific heat near 1 Â°K was found to be C M = 8. 2 x 10 - 3 R/T 2. This is compared with the value 10. 0 x 10 - 3 R/T 2 deduced from demagnetization experiments, and the value 5. 8 x 10 - 3 R/T 2 calculated from the splittings and the dipole-dipole interactions. Possible explanations for the discrepancy with the theoretical value are discussed. Finally a new method of relating magnetic temperatures below 1 Â°K to absolute temperatures is described. Cerium magnesium nitrate, which is known to obey Curie's law down to 0. 006 Â°K was used as a thermometer since its very anisotropic susceptibility can be measured in the presence of another isotropic paramagnetic substance. The design and construction of a system of mutual inductance coils to measure susceptibilities in two directions at right angles is discussed in detail. The method has been used to determine the T-TÂ° relation for <b>manganous</b> ammonium <b>sulphate</b> from its Curie point to 1 Â°K. The temperature of the Curie point of was identified as 0. 127 Â°KÂ± 0. 003. The advantages of this method over the conventional thermo- dynamic method are discussed with special reference to measurements in the Curie point region. </p...|$|R
40|$|Aspartate transcarbamylase is {{purified}} from {{mung bean}} seedlings {{by a series}} of steps involving <b>manganous</b> <b>sulphate</b> treatment, ammonium sulphate fractionation, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, followed by a second ammonium sulphate fractionation and finally gel filtration on Sephadex-G 100. The enzyme is homogeneous on ultracentrifugation and on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It functions optimally at 55 °C. It has two pH optima, one at 8. 0 and the other at 10. 2. The enzyme follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics with l-aspartate as the variable substrate. However, it exhibits sigmoid saturation curves at both the pH optima when the concentration of carbamyl phosphate is varied. The enzyme is allosterically inhibited by UMP at both the pH optima. Increasing phosphorylation of the uridine nucleotide decreases the inhibitory effect. The enzyme is desensitized to inhibition by UMP on treatment with p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, gel electrophoresis indicating that the enzyme is dissociated by this treatment; the dissociated enzyme can be reassociated by treatment with 2 -mercaptoethanol. The properties of the mung bean enzyme are compared with the enzyme from other sources...|$|E
40|$|Freshly {{prepared}} {{cupric hydroxide}} loses its characteristic blue colour, {{in the course}} of a few hours after its preparation and yields a black product. The factors which influence the stabdity of cupric hydroxide have not been clearly understood. Blucher and Farnate found that in presence of small amounts of salts of manganese, nickel, cobalt, zinc and aluminium, cupric hydroxide was stable for some time even at the temperature of boiling water. They prepared cupric hydroxide by mixing 1 ml. each of I N solutions of sodium hydroxide and copper sulphate in presence of about 10 m 1. or water, and treated the samples with a few (1 to 6) drops of <b>manganous</b> <b>sulphate,</b> nickel sulphate etc. The test tubes holding the samples were placed in boiling water. They found that the samples of cupric hydroxide so treated did not blacken as rapidly as an untreated sample. Weiser" investigated the phenomenon in great detail and found that small amounts of salts of manganese, nickel, cobalt etc. as well as cupric sulphate and acids had stabilising action on cupric hydroxide. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In pot {{experiments}} with lettuce, {{the effect of}} chelated and mineral forms of manganese on the fresh matter of plants and {{on the content of}} Mn, Cu, Zn and Fe in let-tuce leaves were compared. Lettuce plants were grown in a peat substrate where the man-ganese content was differentiated in four levels: 10, 20, 30, and 60 mg Mndm- 3. Inde-pendent of the form of the applied manganese, no differences were found in fresh matter of lettuce heads at manganese levels of 10 to 30 mg Mndm- 3 substrate. When the plants were nourished with the mineral form of manganese, then in comparison with the chelated form of manganese, the content of manganese in lettuce leaves was higher. The differenti-ated fertilization with manganese exerted an effect on the nutritional status of plants with copper, zinc and iron. After the application of chelated manganese, there was more copper and iron in the lettuce, but a lesser amount of zinc than in case of <b>manganous</b> <b>sulphate</b> ap-plication. The increase of manganese content in the substrate caused an increase of this component in the plants. Key words: lettuce, chelate, sulphate manganese, micronutrient...|$|E
