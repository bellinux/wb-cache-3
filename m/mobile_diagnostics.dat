Herein we report on {{the development of a new}} disposable electrochemical instrument exploiting the latest advances in printed electronics and printed biosensors. The current system is manufactured under ambient conditions with all interconnections printed; electrochemical measurements and data elaboration are realized by the integration onto the platform of two chips: a MICROCHIP-PIC 24 F 16 KA 101 and a Texas Instrument’s LMP 91000. A PEDOT. PSS vertical electrochromic display (VECD) is also incorporated into the system to visualize the data. A printed Enfucell 3 V manganese dioxide battery was used to deliver the required power.

40|$|<b>Mobile</b> <b>diagnostics</b> – or mobile {{health in}} general – is highly appealing, {{not only for}} clinicians, but also for patients. It implies empowerment, in {{particular}} {{of those who are}} really in need, such as inhabitants of less developed regions within the world who have limited access to healthcare. It also implies simplification: Easy data management – a continuous flow of information. Therefore, development of miniaturized and highly integrated diagnostic systems allowing near patient “instant” diagnostics gain a lot of momentum since more than a decade. However, system integration requires time and a significant amount of investment. In addition, there is strong competition on resources from other emergent technologies, such as next generation sequencing which made the collection of e. g. human genome data less expensive and much faster. A more severe challenge is that <b>mobile</b> <b>diagnostics</b> require a change in healthcare management, e. g. towards integrated practice units. This, in turn, requires implementation of adequate reimbursement, standards of interoperability, training of staff, quality control. In 2010, Germany’s Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) launched the grant initiative Mobile Diagnostic Systems (MD, 2011 ─ 2015) as part of its high-tech strategy. MD aimed at generating knowledge on how microsystem technologies fit into German healthcare environments. On the basis of interviews with multidisciplinary MD actors, this thesis evaluated retrospectively how the publicly funded innovation network managed to overcome pre-defined external barriers of diffusion, including technology, regulatory affairs and market access. Retrospectives reveal internal barriers involving knowledge and technology transfer, negatively influencing generation of innovation. In particular, financing still represents a high hurdle for biotech innovators in Germany: Larger firms look predominately for market-ready or in-market technologies rather than prototypes and venture capitalists are rare or extremely risk-averse. Another important finding was, that actors involved were highly focused on individual work packages. This risks of not seeing the whole environment embedding MD. Consequently, potential opportunities may be missed, e. g. synergies with relatively close (DIALOC) or more distant initiatives (Global Health Delivery Project-based discussion rounds). This could be partly {{due to the fact that}} publicly funded networking activities provide less freedom-to-operate because of pre-defined milestones. In addition, further development of actors with respect to role playing (e. g. boundary spanning or innovation selling) is often not included in such “innovation packages”, but can help to maneuver change. Internal barriers need to be addressed first before targeting the major remaining external hurdle: Reimbursement. Although the latter was covered within MD, standardization of technology evaluation is still an unmet need which strongly influences the willingness-to-implement novel <b>mobile</b> <b>diagnostics.</b> Thus, the value added is to be demonstrated to justify adequate reimbursement. Achieving this goal can be successful, when innovation networking finds its path towards a common vision, e. g. towards value-based integrated healthcare. Pathfinding and visioning can be facilitated by process promoter with excellent network management capabilities. In addition, such a promoter could help to further develop engagement, openness and commitment of collaborators. Therefore, transfer of MD activities to established “top” networks or clusters is recommended for securing valuable knowledge generated. In this environment, an important next step – globalization of MD for ensuring future return on investment – could be triggered as well. Since MD innovation was found to involve both product and service innovation, maneuvering change is particularly challenging for small and medium sized enterprises. These could benefit from engagement in innovation networking. Findings of this case study can help all direct and indirect actors in the field of MD innovation or in other high complex environments to reconsider pathfinding as well as role playing in networking...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Goose circovirus (GCV) {{presents}} an immunosuppressive problem in production of geese. The infection’s clinical symptoms include growth retardation or feathering disorders but the infection process may remain non-symptomatic {{what makes the}} infected birds more susceptible for secondary viral, bacterial and fungal infections. Diagnosis of GCV infection is made by histopathological examination, dot blot hybridization, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR. However these techniques require application of thermocyclers and qualified staff which may be cost-consuming for some diagnostic units. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (LAMP) as a simple method of GCV detection. Results The presented study has shown LAMP as a rapid tool of detecting DNA of goose circovirus (GCV) as soon in 30 min time. The method used three sets of primers: two outer primers (F 3 and B 3), two inner primers (FIP and BIP) and two loop primers (FL and BL) to accelerate the reaction. The optimum reaction temperature and the time were 61 °C for 30 min, respectively. The results were analysed using SYBR Green dye and GelRedTM solutions. Thirty-eight isolates of GCV collected from geese flocks in Poland were examined. For comparison, real-time polymerase chain reaction with F 3 and B 3 primers and SYBR Green dye was conducted. The obtained results have shown GCV-LAMP as a sensitive, rapid and specific assay and alternative for PCR-based methods. Conclusions The developed technique due to its simplicity may be applied by any veterinary laboratory or even <b>mobile</b> <b>diagnostics</b> units for the routine detection of GCV. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{research}} is analysis of clinical course and treatment results of patients with cholera in the Azov area.   Materials and methods. During the period from 29. 05. 2011 to 19. 08. 2011 33 cases of cholera (32 adults and 1 child) and 25 vibrio carriers (22 adults and 3 children), which were caused by toxigenic strains of Vibrio cholera El Tor serogroup O 1 Ogawa.   Results. Likely factors of disease transmission in Mariupol are sea and river water, and the fish that {{were caught in the}} waters of the city. Typical and watery diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain and lack of normal body temperature, dehydration syndrome, characterized clinical cholera for adults in most cases. The mean duration of diarrhoea was 6, 6 days. At 46. 9 % observed atypical symptoms in 10 (31, 3 %) – abdominal pain (1 patient cramping in 7 cases, localized in the epigastria region, at 2 -over stomach). In 5 patients (15, 6 %) had an increase in body temperature to 37, 2 – 37, 7 degrees Celsius. In 15 (46, 9 %) patients had severe nausea accompanied by vomiting. Easy for cholera was observed in 1 (3. 1 %), moderate – in 14 (43, 8 %), heavy – in 17 (53, 1 %) patients. Dehydration I level is set at 4 (12, 5 %), II – from 6 (18, 7 %), III – in 18 (56, 3 %), IV – 4 (12, 5 %) patients. Cholera outbreak was characterized by a predominance of severe disease and severe dehydration (III and IV), which was observed in 68. 8 % of patients. The decisive factor in the treatment of cholera patients was initiated in a timely manner rehydration therapy, in particular the introduction of the solution «Trisol». Against the background of rehydration therapy hyperkalaemia was observed in 9, 4 % of cases, vascular rehydration at 9, 4 %, the cell rehydration in 3, 1 % of patients. Fatal accidents cholera outbreaks have not been observed.   Conclusion. Clinical diagnosis of cholera and the provision of medical care in the prehospital phase were poor, indicating the need for systematic conducting training seminars among experts of ambulance, as well as doctors of primary medical network. Cholera hospitals (or base hospitals) must be equipped with a <b>mobile</b> <b>diagnostics</b> (ultrasound, X-rays) and modern laboratory equipment.

This study investigated the validity of an automated <b>mobile</b> <b>diagnostic</b> audiometer with increased attenuation and real-time noise monitoring for clinical testing outside a sound booth. DESIGN : Attenuation characteristics and reference ambient noise levels for the computer-based audiometer (KUDUwave) was evaluated alongside the validity of environmental noise monitoring. Clinical validity was determined by comparing air and bone conduction thresholds obtained {{inside and outside the}} sound booth (23 subjects). Test-retest reliability was established for a sub-group of 11 subjects. RESULTS : Improved passive attenuation and valid environmental noise monitoring was demonstrated. Clinically, air conduction thresholds inside and outside the sound booth, corresponded within 5 dB or less > 90 % of instances (mean absolute difference 3. 3 ± 3. 2 SD). Bone conduction thresholds corresponded within 5 dB or less in 80 % of comparisons between test environments, with a mean absolute difference of 4. 6 dB (3. 7 SD). Threshold differences were not statistically significant. Mean absolute testretest differences outside the sound booth was similar to those in the booth.

This report describes the evaluation of a <b>mobile</b> <b>diagnostic</b> system (Enigma Field Laboratory) that performs automated sequential steps for nucleic acid extraction and real-time PCR to detect capripoxvirus DNA within laboratory and endemic field settings. To prepare stable reagents that could be deployed into field settings, lyophilized reagents were used that employed an established diagnostic PCR assay. These stabilized reagents demonstrated an analytical sensitivity that was equivalent, or greater than the established laboratory-based PCR test which utilizes wet reagents, and the limit of detection for the complete assay pipeline was approximately one log 10 more sensitive than the laboratory-based PCR assay. Concordant results were generated when the mobile PCR system was compared to the laboratory-based PCR using samples collected from Africa, Asia and Europe (n = 10) and experimental studies (n = 9) representing clinical cases of sheep pox, goat pox and lumpy skin disease. Furthermore, this mobile assay reported positive results in situ using specimens that were collected from a dairy cow in Morogoro, Tanzania, which was exhibiting clinical signs of lumpy skin disease.
