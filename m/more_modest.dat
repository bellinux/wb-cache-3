More recent authors include Charles Ferdinand Ramuz (1878–1947), whose novels {{describe}} {{the lives of}} peasants and mountain dwellers, set in a harsh environment and Blaise Cendrars (born Frédéric Sauser, 1887–1961). Also Italian and Romansh-speaking authors contributed but in <b>more</b> <b>modest</b> way given their small number.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} season in {{succession}} {{the highlights of the}} fixture list were the games against local rivals The Wednesday, with a record 22,900 supporters attending Bramall Lane to see the Blades record a 5–0 victory at the end of October. Just under a month later United lost the return fixture at Olive Grove 4–1 in front of a <b>more</b> <b>modest</b> crowd of just under 12,000.|$|E
5|$|It {{took four}} months for reports of Heber's death to reach England. At Oxford, representatives of Brasenose and All Souls opened a fund for an {{appropriate}} memorial; this idea {{was taken over}} by Williams-Wynn, who wanted a national rather than an Oxford-based monument. From the large sum collected, Chantrey was paid £3,000 for a huge marble sculpture that was placed in St Paul's Cathedral, London. <b>More</b> <b>modest</b> memorials were raised in the parish churches at Hodnet and Malpas.|$|E

5|$|Joseph Denison, {{a wealthy}} banker, {{purchased}} the estate in about 1787, and it {{remained in the}} Denison family until 1849, when it passed to Thomas Cubitt, a master builder. At the time, Cubitt was working on Osborne House for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and the mansion he designed to replace the old one was a <b>more</b> <b>modest</b> version of Osborne. It was still a substantial building though, in the Italianate style, with almost 100 rooms on three storeys.|$|E

The frame structures associated with these plantations, together {{with those of the}} Cocolobo Cay Club and frame buildings on Boca Chita Key, have been destroyed by fire and hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} fees {{themselves were}} a significant {{legacy of the}} expansion effort. Smith claims US$14 to $15 million was brought in and that it saved the league. A <b>more</b> <b>modest</b> assessment suggests expansion saved the Stampeders and Tiger-Cats—both teams were undeniably in distress during the era—and that the other Canadian teams were able to have maintain a semblance of stability.|$|E

As for the young girls, they were <b>more</b> retiring and <b>modest,</b> <b>more</b> tidy in their dress, and far fresher and more beautiful than the damsels of the coast. A thousand pities, thought I, that they should bury their charms in this nook of a valley.|$|R

5|$|Although no flight-deck cruisers {{were ever}} {{built by the}} U.S. Navy, the Soviet Union's , {{developed}} in the 1970s, is remarkably {{similar to that of}} the original flight-deck cruiser design, featuring an angled flight deck aft with anti-ship missile launchers forwards. In addition, during the early 1980s, plans were proposed for the reactivation of the U.S. Navy's Iowa-class battleships that entailed the removal of each ship's aft turret and the installation of a flight deck for operating V/STOL aircraft; in the end a much <b>more</b> <b>modest</b> conversion, lacking the flight deck, was carried out.|$|E
5|$|Castles, in {{the sense}} of a {{fortified}} residence of a lord or noble, arrived in Scotland as part of David I's encouragement of Norman and French nobles to settle with feudal tenures, particularly in the south and east, and were a way of controlling the contested lowlands. These were primarily wooden motte-and-bailey constructions, of a raised mount or motte, surmounted by a wooden tower and a larger adjacent enclosure or bailey, both usually surrounded by a fosse (a ditch) and palisade, and connected by a wooden bridge. They varied in size from the very large such as the Bass of Inverurie, to <b>more</b> <b>modest</b> designs like Balmaclellan.|$|E

5|$|For the poor, hemp was {{the common}} item {{used to make}} clothing, while the rich could afford silk clothes. Silk clothes found in Han tombs include padded robes, {{double-layered}} robes, single-layered robes, single-layered skirts, shoes, socks, and mittens. The wealthy also wore fox and badger furs, wild duck plumes, and slippers with inlaid leather or silk lining; those of <b>more</b> <b>modest</b> means could wear wool and ferret skins. Large bamboo-matted suitcases found in Han tombs contained clothes and luxury items such as patterned fabric and embroidery, common silk, damask and brocade, and the leno (or gauze) weave, all with rich colors and designs. The Han also had tools for ironing clothes.|$|E
5|$|For the regiment, {{expansion}} {{was on a}} <b>more</b> <b>modest</b> {{scale than}} that of the Great War. Ten battalions (see List of battalions of the King's Regiment (Liverpool)) were formed between 1939 and 1940, including the reconstituted 8th (Liverpool Irish) Battalion. Two of the battalions converted to armour and anti-air roles in 1941: the 11th became the 152nd Regiment in the Royal Armoured Corps, but continued to wear their King's Regiment cap badge on the black beret of the RAC, as did all infantry units converted in this way, while the 12th transferred to the Royal Artillery as 101st Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment.|$|E
5|$|Gisborough Priory is {{a ruined}} Augustinian priory in Guisborough in the borough of Redcar and Cleveland and {{ceremonial}} county of North Yorkshire, England. It {{was founded in}} 1119 as the Priory of St Mary by the Norman feudal magnate Robert de Brus, also an ancestor of the Scottish king, Robert the Bruce. It {{became one of the}} richest monastic foundations in England with grants from the crown and bequests from de Brus, other nobles and gentry and local people of <b>more</b> <b>modest</b> means. Much of the Romanesque Norman priory was destroyed in a fire in 1289. It was rebuilt in the Gothic style on a grander scale over the following century. Its remains are regarded as among the finest surviving examples of early Gothic architecture in England.|$|E
40|$|For {{reasons that}} are unclear to me, the {{committees}} reviewing the articles of the Uniform Commercial Code and drafting revisions are congenitally conservative. Perhaps these committees take their charge too seriously, namely, to revise, not to revolutionize. Perhaps their intimate knowledge {{of the subject matter}} exaggerates the importance of each section and consequently magnifies the apparent size of every change. In any case, my own experience with two such committees tells me that the members quickly become focused on revisions and amendments that any outsider would describe as modest. To the extent that the revision of any of the articles of the UCC is going to be <b>more</b> than <b>modest,</b> the push must come from academics or practicing commercial lawyers outside of these committees. In this Essay I accept my own offer to propose a modification in Article 9 that most commercial lawyers will think is <b>more</b> than <b>modest.</b> For myself, I claim only that it might be at the upper bound of modest change; viewed from a distance, it certainly is not revolutionary...|$|R

5|$|In 1826, Wilberforce {{moved from}} his large house in Kensington Gore to Highwood Hill, a <b>more</b> <b>modest</b> {{property}} in the countryside of Mill Hill, north of London, where he was soon joined by his son William and family. William had attempted a series of educational and career paths, and a venture into farming in 1830 led to huge losses, which his father repaid in full, despite offers from others to assist. This left Wilberforce with little income, and he was obliged to let his home and {{spend the rest of}} his life visiting family members and friends. He continued his support for the anti-slavery cause, including attending and chairing meetings of the Anti-Slavery Society.|$|E
5|$|MIT's {{proximity}} to Harvard University ("the other school up the river") {{has led to}} a substantial number of research collaborations such as the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology and the Broad Institute. In addition, students at the two schools can cross-register for credits toward their own school's degrees without any additional fees. A cross-registration program between MIT and Wellesley College has also existed since 1969, and in 2002 the Cambridge–MIT Institute launched an undergraduate exchange program between MIT and the University of Cambridge. MIT has <b>more</b> <b>modest</b> cross-registration programs with Boston University, Brandeis University, Tufts University, Massachusetts College of Art and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.|$|E
5|$|The French {{approach}} to funding memorials also relied mainly on voluntary fundraising, but featured {{a greater role}} for the state. A law passed in 1919 provided for a subsidy from central government to local authorities to assist in building memorials; the money was distributed {{in proportion to the}} number of local citizens who had died in the war. Nonetheless the largest French projects, such as the Ossuary of Douaumont, were still paid for mostly through private fund raising across France and the international community: it could take many years to raise the sums required. The Ossuary cost 15 m francs to build; {{at the other end of}} the scale, <b>more</b> <b>modest</b> urban memorials cost around 300,000 francs.|$|E

5|$|The {{participation}} of Marat and Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya in the Winter War {{was limited to}} a bombardment of Finnish coastal artillery in December 1939 at Saarenpää in the Beryozovye Islands before the Gulf of Finland iced over. They failed to inflict any permanent damage before being driven off by near misses. Both ships had their anti-aircraft armament modernized and reinforced over the winter of 1939–40 and were transferred to Tallinn shortly after the Soviets occupied Estonia in 1940. Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya received more AA guns in February–March 1941. Parizhskaya Kommuna received a <b>more</b> <b>modest</b> number of AA guns while she was receiving her bulges, but landed four 120-mm guns right before the Germans invaded.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} Treaty of Schönbrunn was {{the harshest}} that France had imposed on Austria in recent memory. Metternich and Archduke Charles had {{the preservation of}} the Habsburg Empire as their fundamental goal, and to this end the former succeeded in making Napoleon seek <b>more</b> <b>modest</b> goals in return for promises of Franco-Austrian peace and friendship. Nevertheless, while most of the hereditary lands remained part of Habsburg territories, France received Carinthia, Carniola, and the Adriatic ports, while Galicia was given to the Poles and the Salzburg area of the Tyrol went to the Bavarians. Austria lost over three million subjects, about one-fifth of her total population, {{as a result of these}} territorial changes.|$|E

Through an Indian connection in Rangoon (Yangon), Rajkumar makes contact with Ratnagiri via Uma, and is accordingly granted an audience with the Collector and his wife over a meal that of course stiffly conforms to colonial best practice.

The computational advantages of the former, and the interpretive richness of the latter, beg the question: how are the two related? The exact functional relationship between the signature vector and the vector of signed dominations is obtained.
