25|$|Cerebral palsy (CP) {{describes}} a non-progressive disorder of motor function stemming from malformation or early {{damage to the}} brain. CP can manifest in many ways, given the different manner in which brain can be damaged; in common to all forms {{is the emergence of}} signs and symptoms of impairment as the child develops. However, milestones that have been accomplished and neurologic functions that have developed do not deteriorate in CP as they often do in children with A-T in the late pre-school years. Most children with ataxia caused by CP do not begin to walk at a normal age, whereas most children with A-T start to walk at a normal age even though they often “wobble” from the start. Pure ataxia is a rare manifestation of early brain damage or malformation, however, and the possibility of an occult genetic disorder of brain should be considered and sought for those in whom ataxia is the chief <b>manif</b> estation of CP. Children with ataxic CP will not manifest the laboratory abnormalities associated with A-T.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to {{solution}} of two classes of enumerative problems. The first class is related to enumeration of regions of hyperplane arrangements. We investigate deformations of Coxeter arrangements. In particular, we prove a conjecture of Stanley on the numbers of regions of Linial arrangements. These numbers have several additional combinatorial interpretations in terms of trees, partially ordered sets, and tournaments. We study a more general class of truncated affine arrangements, counting their regions, giving formulas for their Poincar'e polynomials, and proving a "Riemann hypothesis" on location of zeros of the latter. In addition, we find a couple of new interpretations for the Catalan numbers. The second class of problems comes from enumerative algebraic geometry and Schubert calculus and is related to Gromov-Witten invariants of complex flag manifolds.

40|$|The Internet {{has become}} a {{semantic}} battlefield where parties and government representatives are subject to virtual agitators, scamming or smear campaigns. As new forms of civic engagement tap into the potential offered by social media platforms, they require less commitment from citizens, who increasingly turn away from conventional political participation. However, beyond these manifestations, which eventually produce little real-world impact, online activism can also result in more consolidated forms of politicking, far removed from traditional party structures. Established leaders, used to conventional means of political communication, are thereby confronted with grassroots movements resulting from the spontaneous aggregation of different online protests. This paper shall first refer to the Presidency of François Hollande - a President facing an ever-growing oppositional swarm, with protests such as the <b>Manif</b> pour Tous or the Printemps français.

40|$|First lines: On September 14 th and 15 th 2013, la <b>Manif</b> pour tous, a French protest group {{fighting}} against same-sex marriage, organized a summer school near Paris {{to celebrate a}} year of mobilization against the Taubira law. This law, named after the French Minister of Justice, Christiane Taubira, passed in April 2013, legalizing same-sex marriage and the adoption of children by same-sex married couples. In August, le Printemps français, another group protesting against the law, had also organized a summer school, which lasted a week and {{took place in a}} castle in the countryside. The summer schools were opportunities to take stock of the protests organized for the past year, but also to plan new offensives against the socialist government and its projects dealing with family and education.

40|$|Background. The {{positive}} impact of opioid substitution treatment (OST) on opioid-dependent individuals with {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) infection is well documented, {{especially with regard to}} adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We used the data from a 5 -year longitudinal study of the <b>MANIF</b> 2000 cohort of individuals infected with HIV (as a result of injection drug use) and receiving HAART to investigate the predictors of long-term virological success. Design. Data were collected every 6 months from outpatient hospital services delivering HIV care in France. We selected all patients who were receiving HAART for at least 6 months (baseline visit) and who had indications for OST (ie, still dependent on opioids). We selected a total of 113 patients, accounting for a total of 562 visits for all the analyses. Methods. Long-term virological success was defined as an undetectable viral load after at least 6 months on HAART. Retention in OST was defined as the time interval between the last initiation or reinitiation of OST during HAART follow-up and any given visit on OST. A mixed logistic model was used to identify predictors of long-term virological success. Results. At baseline, 53 patients were receiving buprenorphine, 28 patients were receiving methadone, and 32 patients were not on OST. The median duration of OST was 25 months (range, 3 – 42 months).

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the influence of continued drug use and its perception by prescribing physicians on access to antiretroviral treatment among French HIV infected injection drug users (IDUs). DESIGN: Cross sectional including enrollment data (October 1995 - 1996) of the cohort study <b>MANIF</b> 2000. Access to treatment is compared in three groups: former IDUs (n = 68) and active IDUs whether or not this behaviour remains undetected (n = 38) or detected (n = 17) by physicians. SETTING: Hospital departments for specialist AIDS care in south eastern France and inner suburbs of Paris. PATIENTS: All enrolled patients with CD 4 + cell counts < 400 with detailed clinical history, access to treatment, risk behaviours, and past drug use as reported by both physicians and patients (n = 123). MAIN RESULTS: A minority (43. 9 %) already received an antiretroviral treatment. Active IDUs had worst socioeconomic and psychological conditions but only those detected by physicians were considered as poorly compliant. Logistic regression showed that, with respect to ex-IDUs and independently of clinical stage, active IDUs, {{whether or not they were}} perceived as such by physicians, were threefold more likely not to receive antiretroviral treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Even among French HIV infected IDUs who have regular access to AIDS specialised hospital care, continued drug use reduced the likelihood of being prescribed antiretroviral treatment. To reduce delays in access to new treatments, specific efforts must be devoted towards both AIDS specialists and IDU patients to overcome current stereotypes of non-compliance associated with continued injection...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Opioid {{maintenance}} treatment (OMT) {{has a positive}} impact on substance use and health outcomes among HIV-infected opioid dependent patients. The present study investigates non-medical use of opioids by HIV-infected opioid-dependent individuals treated with buprenorphine or methadone. Methods The <b>MANIF</b> 2000 study is a longitudinal study that enrolled a cohort of 476 HIV-infected opioid-dependent individuals. Data were collected in outpatient hospital services delivering HIV care in France. The sample comprised all patients receiving OMT (either methadone or buprenorphine) who attended at least one follow-up visit with data on adherence to OMT (N = 235 patients, 1056 visits). Non-medical use of opioids during OMT was defined as having reported use of opioids in a non-medical context, and/or the misuse of the prescribed oral OMT by an inappropriate route of administration (injection or sniffing). After adjusting for the non-random assignment of OMT type, a model based on GEE was then used to identify predictors of non-medical use of opioids. Results Among the 235 patients, 144 (61. 3 %) and 91 (38. 9 %) patients were receiving buprenorphine and methadone, respectively, at baseline. Non-medical use of opioids was found in 41. 6 % of visits for 83 % of individual patients. In the multivariate analysis, predictors of non-medical use of opioids were: cocaine, daily cannabis, and benzodiazepine use, experience of opioid withdrawal symptoms, and less time since OMT initiation. Conclusions Non-medical use of opioids was found to be comparable in OMT patients receiving methadone or buprenorphine. The presence of opioid withdrawal symptoms was a determinant of non-medical use of opioids and may serve as a clinical indicator of inadequate dosage, medication, or type of follow-up. Sustainability and continuity of care with adequate monitoring of withdrawal symptoms and polydrug use may contribute to reduced harms from ongoing non-medical use of opioids. </p...|$|E
