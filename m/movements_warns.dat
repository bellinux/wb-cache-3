40|$|Apart {{from the}} {{positive}} effects, which {{are reflected in}} the relative improvement of the quality of life, the way households satisfy their needs has a direct impact on many environmental problems. Among them are global climatic changes, air, soil and water pollution, excessive usage of natural resources and loss of biodiversity. Sustainable consumption belongs to the key elements of global movement for sustainable development. It can be characterized as consumer behaviour which satisfies the needs of current and future generations. Czech households influence the environment every day by doing their shopping, consuming and using various kinds of products and services, the way they spend their leisure time, by commuting to work and travelling in general and, last but not the least, by producing waste. Both the location {{and the size of the}} household significantly influence the environment as well. 30 to 40 % of environmental problems are caused by households. Thus, pro-environmental <b>movements</b> <b>warn</b> of the necessity to eliminate negative impacts of households’ behaviour. This paper analyses development tendencies of relevant indicators of household operations which have impact on the environment. The attention is paid primarily to consumption of electrical energy, water and food by households, usage of personal means of transport and production of communal waste. Time series statistical methods were used when assessing development tendencies...|$|R
40|$|The sociological {{literature}} on global environmental change emphasizes the {{processes by which}} the problem of global warming is socially constructed. However, the opposing efforts to construct the "non-problematicity " of global warming advanced by the conservative movement are largely ignored. Utilizing recent work on framing processes in the social movements literature and claims-making from the social problems literature, this paper analyzes the counter-claims promoted by the conservative movement between 1990 and 1997 as it mobilized to challenge the legitimacy of global warming as a social problem. A thematic content analysis of publications cir-culated on the web sites of prominent conservative think tanks reveals three major counter-claims. First, the movement criticized the evidentiary basis of global warming as weak, if not entirely wrong. Second, the move-ment argued that global warming will have substantial benefits if it occurs. Third, the <b>movement</b> <b>warned</b> that proposed action to ameliorate global warming would {{do more harm than}} good. In short, the conservative movement asserted that, while the science of global warming appears to be growing more and more uncertain, the harmful effects of global warming policy are becoming increasingly certain. In order to better understand the controversy over global warming, future research should pay attention to the influence of the conservative movement by identifying the crucial roles of conservative foundations, conservative think tanks, and sympathetic "skeptic " scientists in undermining the growing scientific consensus over the reality of global warming...|$|R

40|$|Zeitgeist, the “spirit of the times,” is a {{phenomenon}} that has been acknowledged by historians and sociologists examining various aspects of cultures (Danielson, 1989). According to Pearce (1954) Zeitgeist is about dictating people’s likes and dislikes of apparel and personal appearance. In this study, a new attitude and approach in fashion illustration is to be examined, namely computer illustration. In the business of fashion, illustration {{is one of the}} ways employed to present ideas. Through the spirit of times, fashion illustration, undeniably forms a specific visual language, and has become a universal means of communication. Fashion illustration is different from any other type of illustration because of its subject matter. It explores approaches and styles in a great variety of media. Today’s computer challenges the stereotype of the artist who draws with brush or pen in hand. It also forces a re-evaluation of what is illustration and the traditional meaning of fashion illustration. The question of technological domination is also a complex issue. According to Sparke (1991), people are either for it or against it, and endless debates will continue to take place concerning the role of the ‘machine’. Sparke further mentioned that already in 1936, Herbert Read, a renown figure in the British art and design <b>movement,</b> <b>warned</b> us: “The danger we run in a machine age is that we sacrifice one set of values and confine art to an intellectual concern with form and function”. Where pluralism of tastes and/or the need to create a market is in evidence, and that the technological aspect becomes a part of the creation, such digital technology requires a reevaluation of what fashion illustration is, in terms of both a search for an appropriate aesthetic for its products and its beneficial and detrimental effects on the fashion illustration culture as a whole.

5000|$|Fates Warning is an American {{progressive}} metal band, {{formed in}} 1982 by vocalist John Arch, guitarists Jim Matheos and Victor Arduini, bassist Joe DiBiase, and drummer Steve Zimmerman in Hartford, Connecticut. Their early work was {{heavily influenced by}} new wave of British heavy metal, and was key {{in the development of}} American power metal. With each work, the band developed into a pure progressive metal style. Fates Warning has experienced numerous line-up changes. From 1982 to 1996 — and temporarily in 2010 — Matheos and DiBiase were the only remaining original members of the band, with Matheos being the only constant member. Their current lineup consists of guitarists Jim Matheos and Frank Aresti, vocalist Ray Alder, bassist Joey Vera, and drummer Bobby Jarzombek. As a pioneer of the American progressive metal <b>movement,</b> Fates <b>Warning</b> rose to international fame in the 1980s and was ranked as one of the early [...] "flagship bands of progressive metal" [...] along with Queensrÿche, Dream Theater, Crimson Glory and Watchtower, who were responsible for creating, developing and popularizing that genre.|$|R

I used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} to depict the neural substrates of this warning effect during a Go/NoGo task incorporating a warning stimulus. I hypothesized that the warning stimuli activate the midbrain-thalamic-ACC alertness system irrespective of stimulus modality, and the areas which are related to early stage of motor processing such as pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA). Fifteen subjects completed a visual Go/NoGo task, and 12 completed an analogous task in the auditory modality. After a variable-duration warning stimulus was presented, a Go or NoGo cue was presented with equal probability. When a Go cue was presented, subjects had to respond as rapidly as possible by pressing a button. When a NoGo cue was presented, subjects were required not to respond. Auditory and visual warning stimuli commonly activated the midbrain and thalamus, which are associated with tasks involving directed attention and alertness. Warning-related activation was found in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which might monitor the task-related utility of the warning stimulus, and in the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), which is associated with <b>movement</b> selection. <b>Warning</b> stimuli might potentiate pre-SMA activity related to movement selection and/or preparation, through the midbrain-thalamus-ACC alerting system...|$|R

Some scholars have questioned the utility of the human rights framework given the diminished governance capacity of many Third World states due to decades of intervention by international financial institutions and restrictions imposed by trade and investment agreements.
