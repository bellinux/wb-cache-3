5|$|Emily Sartain (March 17, 1841 – June 17, 1927) was an American {{painter and}} engraver. She {{was the first}} woman in Europe and the United States to {{practice}} the art of <b>mezzotint</b> <b>engraving,</b> and the only woman to win a gold medal at the 1876 World Fair in Philadelphia. Sartain became a nationally recognized art educator and was the director of the Philadelphia School of Design for Women from 1866 to 1920. Her father, John Sartain, and three of her brothers, William, Henry and Samuel were artists. Before she entered the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and studied abroad, her father took her on a Grand Tour of Europe. She helped found the New Century Club for working and professional women, and the professional women's art clubs, The Plastic Club and The Three Arts Club.|$|E
500|$|In 1858, Sartain {{graduated}} from the Philadelphia Normal School and then taught school until the summer of 1862. John Sartain taught his daughter art, including the <b>mezzotint</b> <b>engraving</b> technique that he revived, which was a favored process in England that created high-quality prints of paintings. John Sartain believed in equal opportunities for women and encouraged his daughter to pursue a career. He mortgaged his house {{and gave her a}} [...] "gentleman's education" [...] in fine art by taking her on a Grand Tour of Europe beginning the summer of 1862. They started in Montreal and Quebec and then sailed for Europe. She enjoyed the English countryside; old world cities, especially Florence and Edinburgh; the Louvre; Italian Renaissance paintings; and artists like Dante and engraver Elena Perfetti. She traveled to Venice to visit William Dean Howells and his wife Elinor Mead Howells, who was a painter. Sartain decided {{in the course of the}} trip that she wanted to become an artist. During their travels the Sartains learned that William Sartain had enlisted during the Civil War (1861–1865) and later hastily returned to the United States when John and Emily learned that the Confederate States Army had crossed into Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, which is 158 miles west of Philadelphia.|$|E

An American flag {{was created by}} ensign Thomas Mendenhall and flown to replace the British one. This was [...] "the first American stars ever seen in a foreign port"; that is, according to Elizabeth Montgomery, the captain's daughter, and Thomas C. Mendenhall, by family tradition. Her book includes an <b>mezzotint</b> <b>engraving</b> by John Sartain that shows Nancy flying an American flag with a circle of ten stars surrounding three central stars.|$|E

6000|$|... 136. Again, {{the arts}} of etching and <b>mezzotint</b> <b>engraving</b> depend principally for their effect on the velvety, or bloomy texture of their darkness, {{and the best of}} all {{painting}} is the fresco work of great colourists, in which the colours are what is usually called dead; but they are anything but dead, they glow with the luminous bloom of life. The frescoes of Correggio, when not repainted, are supreme in this quality.|$|E
6000|$|... 10. But are you {{prepared}} absolutely to accept this limitation with respect to engraving as a pictorial art? Will you call nothing an engraving, except a group of furrows or cavities cut in a hard substance? What shall we say of <b>mezzotint</b> <b>engraving,</b> for instance, in which, though indeed furrows and cavities are produced mechanically as a ground, the artist's work is in effacing them? And {{when we consider the}} power of engraving in representing pictures and multiplying them, are we to recognize and admire no effects of light and shade except those which are visibly produced by dots or furrows? I mean, will the virtue of an engraving be in exhibiting these imperfect means of its effect, or in concealing them? ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{have only}} to state, in conclusion, that these twelve {{drawings}} of the Harbors of England are more representable by engraving than most of his works. Few parts of them are brilliant in color; they were executed chiefly in brown and blue, and with more direct reference to the future engraving than was common with Turner. They are also small in size, generally of the exact dimensions of the plate, and therefore {{the lines of the}} compositions are not spoiled by contraction; while finally, the touch of the painter's hand upon the wave-surface is far better imitated by <b>mezzotint</b> <b>engraving</b> than by any of the ordinary expedients of line. Take them all in all, they form the most valuable series of marine studies which have as yet been published from his works; and I hope that they may be of some use hereafter in recalling the ordinary aspect of our English seas, at the exact period when the nation had done its utmost in the wooden and woven strength of ships, and had most perfectly fulfilled the old and noble prophecy-- ...|$|E

[1] Photography cannot {{exhibit the}} {{character}} of large and finished sculpture; but its audacity of shadow is in perfect harmony with the more roughly picturesque treatment necessary in coins. For the rendering of all such frank relief, and for the better explanation of forms disturbed by the luster of metal or polished stone, the method employed in the plates of this volume will be found, I believe, satisfactory. Casts are first taken from the coins, in white plaster; these are photographed, and the photograph printed by the autotype process. Plate XII. is exceptional, being a pure <b>mezzotint</b> <b>engraving</b> of the old school, excellently carried through by my assistant, Mr. Allen, who was taught, as a personal favor to myself, by my friend, and Turner's fellow-worker, Thomas Lupton. Plate IV. {{was intended to be}} a photograph from the superb vase in the British Museum, No. 564 in Mr. Newton's Catalogue; but its variety of color defied photography, and after the sheets had gone to press I was compelled to reduce Le Normand's plate of it, which is unsatisfactory, but answers my immediate purpose.|$|E

6000|$|... 196. Pictures {{executed}} on such {{a system}} are not, properly speaking, works in color at all; they are studies of light and shade, in which both the shade and the distance are rendered in the general hue which best expresses their attributes of coolness and transparency; and the lights and the foreground are executed in that which best expresses their warmth and solidity. This advantage may just as well be taken as not, in studies {{of light and shadow}} to be executed with the hand; but the use of two, three, or four colors, always in the same relations and places, does not in the least constitute the work a study of color, any more than the brown engravings of the Liber Studiorum; nor would the idea of color be in general more present to the artist's mind when he was at work on one of these drawings, than when he was using pure brown in the <b>mezzotint</b> <b>engraving.</b> But the idea of space, warmth, and freshness being not successfully expressible in a single tint, and perfectly expressible by the admission of three or four, he allows himself this advantage when it is possible, without in the least embarrassing himself with the actual color of the objects to be represented. A stone in the foreground might in nature have been cold gray, but it will be drawn nevertheless of a rich brown, because it is in the foreground; a hill in the distance might in nature be purple with heath, or golden with furze; but it will be drawn, nevertheless, of a cool gray, because it is in the distance.|$|E
