40|$|Background Numerous {{monoclonal}} antibodies (MAbs) {{have been}} produced to antigens found in human melanomas. Three of the best characterized <b>melanoma</b> <b>antigens</b> include the melanoma-associated glycoproteins (MAGs) defined by two reagent families—the ME 491 family (including ME 491, 8 - 1 H, and 8 - 2 A) and the NKI/C- 3 family (including NKI/C- 3 and NKI/black- 13) —as well as the neuroglandular antigen (NGA) defined by MAbs LS 59, LS 62, and LS 140. These three antigens have significant similarities in tissue distribution, biosynthesis, and structure. The ME 491 MAG has been cloned, mapped, and sequenced. Numerous non-melanoma-associated proteins (Sm 23, CO- 029, R 2, TAPA- 1, CD 9, CD 37, CD 53, and CD 63) have recently {{been shown to have}} significant homology to this sequence. Purpose We conducted this study to investigate the similarity between the two MAG antigens and NGA. Methods Several reagents defining the three different <b>melanoma</b> <b>antigens</b> were compared, using competition immunoprecipitation, immunoas-say, and inhibition radioimmunoassay techniques. Results Immunoassay experiments show that MAbs defining the three <b>melanoma</b> <b>antigens</b> bind to affinity-purified ME 491 antigen and inhibit each other from binding in an inhibition radioimmunoassay. Competition immunoprecipitation ex-periments demonstrate that the ME 491 and NKI/C- 3 antibodies bind to NGA. Rabbit anti-ME 491 idiotype serum recognizes determinants shared by NKI/C- 3 and the anti-NGA MAbs. A competition immunoprecipitation experiment also confirms the identity of CD 63, as defined by MAb RUU-SP 2. 28, with the three <b>melanoma</b> <b>antigens.</b> Conclusion These data indicate that the MAGs defined by ME 491 and NKI/C- 3 as well as the anti-NGA antibodies are epitopes of the same molecule, which is identical to CD 63 by both immunochemical and molecular genetic investigations. Implications Our results indicate that the data obtained in studies of these three <b>melanoma</b> <b>antigens</b> may be pooled, and we propose that the molecule recognized by these reagents be classified as CD 63.

50|$|In August 2007 Immutep {{announced}} its {{involvement in a}} Phase I study being conducted at the University Hospital of Lausanne in Switzerland where a group was working on adoptive T cell transfer after transient lymphodepletion associated with peptide vaccination. This study recruited 12 patients (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00324623, Immutep code name P007) where the patient's lymphocytes were depleted using chemotherapy, after which patients were given their own peripheral mononuclear cells, enriched with tumour-specific CD8 T cells. During the immune reconstitution period the patients were given a cancer vaccine containing a peptide <b>melanoma</b> <b>antigen</b> called MART1, adjuvanted with incomplete Freund’s adjuvant and, in half the patients, IMP321. While there was no confirmed responses as per the RECIST criteria for the 12 patients recruited, the investigators noted a significant expansion of MART-1-specific CD8 T cells in the IMP321 group, where {{there was also a}} higher proportions of effector cells and a significantly reduced expansion of regulatory T cells.

40|$|Although {{they are}} {{considered}} as antigen presenting cells (APC), the role of antigen-unspecific B-lymphocytes in antigen presentation and T lymphocyte stimulation remains controversial. In this paper, we tested the capacity of normal human peripheral activated B cells to stimulate T cells using <b>melanoma</b> <b>antigens</b> or <b>melanoma</b> cell lysates. B lymphocytes activated through CD 40 ligation and then pulsed with tumor antigens efficiently processed and presented MHC class II restricted peptides to specific CD 4 + T cell clones. This suggests that CD 40 -activated B cells have the functional and molecular competence to present MHC class II epitopes when pulsed with exogenous antigens, thereby making them a relevant source of APC to generate T cells. To test this hypothesis, CD 40 -activated B cells were pulsed with a lysate prepared from melanoma cells and used to stimulate peripheral autologous T cells. Interestingly, T cells specific to <b>melanoma</b> <b>antigens</b> were generated. Further analysis of these T cell clones revealed that they recognized MHC class II restricted epitopes from tyrosinase, a known <b>melanoma</b> tumor <b>antigen.</b> The efficient antigen presentation by antigen-unspecific activated B cells was correlated with a down-regulation in the expression of HLA-DO, a B cell specific protein known to interfere with HLA-DM function. Because HLA-DM is important in MHC class II peptide loading, the observed decrease in HLA-DO may partially explain the enhanced antigen presentation following B-cell activation. Results globally suggest that when they are properly activated, antigen-unspecific B-lymphocytes can present exogenous antigens by MHC class II molecules and stimulate peripheral antigen-specific T cells. Antigen presentation by activated B cells could be exploited for immunotherapy by allowing the in vitro generation of T cells specific against antigens expressed by tumors or viruses.
