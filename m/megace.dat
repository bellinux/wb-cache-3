50|$|Megestrol acetate (abbreviated as MGA), {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} <b>Megace,</b> is a {{progestin}} with antiandrogen activity that is mainly used as an appetite stimulant and less commonly {{in the treatment of}} breast and endometrial cancers. It is the C17α acetate ester of megestrol, which, in contrast to MGA, was never marketed for medical use. The term megestrol is often inappropriately used as a synonym for MGA, and when it is used, it almost always refers to MGA rather actually than megestrol. MGA is taken by mouth.|$|E
40|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} predominately a {{postmenopausal}} disease. Endometrial cancer in {{women of childbearing}} age is relatively unusual. Endometrial cancer is typically treated with hysterectomy. After the development of endometrial cancer, successful pregnancy is rare. We present a case of recurrent stage I endometrial adenocarcinoma in a 35 -year-old woman. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed endometrial lesions without myometrium inva-sion and no pelvic lymph node enlargement. The patient refused surgical intervention with abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy because of her essential desire for children. Fertility-preserving medical therapy with megestrol acetate for 1 year and sub-sequent assisted reproductive treatment (ART) were performed. Successful pregnancy occurred after in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET). On the basis of these observa-tions and the low malignant potential of well-differentiated endometrial carcinoma, fertility-preserving treatment using <b>Megace</b> therapy was suggested. In this case, recurrence occurred after the completion of <b>Megace</b> therapy and three failed attempts at artificial insemination by the husband (AIH). Recurrent endometrial adenocarcinoma was documented using hys-teroscopy and direct endometrial biopsy. Another course of <b>Megace</b> therapy was adminis-tered due to her desire for children. A successful pregnancy occurred after long-term med-ical treatment and IVF-ET. (Chang Gung Med J 2008; 31 : 102 - 6...|$|E

40|$|A {{deterioration}} of renal function with CHI {{is connected to}} a rapid disease progression and increased mortality. Several studies show a relationship of diuretics application, WRF and increased mortality [70 73, 78, 81]. The further elucidation of these relationships {{is of particular interest}} {{in the context of the}} CHI Avancierens the number one cause of death worldwide. In the animal experiment of S. Strasbourg [171], an increased mortality of rats with induced Furosemidtherapie LAD ligation showed CHI compared to a placebo group (p = 0. 028). Pathological changes in the rat kidneys were suspected as the cause of increased mortality. To test this hypothesis, the present work on the histochemical and laboratory analysis of kidney structure and function of surviving rats in the animal study by S. Strasbourg [171] focused. The original study design, an examination of mortality in cardiac cachexia, megestrol acetate, on the other hand showed an improved survival and improved LVEF, especially under <b>Megace</b> ® ES. The present data and animal material layer from the work of S. Strasbourg [171] for the first time a possible use of megestrol acetate for treatment of cardiac cachexia and kardiorenalem syndrome could be analyzed in the context. The present study design and the reduced material layer due to the decedents, represent a bias and reduce the significance of this work. Under the CHI induced here the rats developed a reduced relative kidney weight. With increased renal interstitial fibrosis, however, reduced glomerulosclerosis and renal arterial vascular status understated no effect of CHI on renal function could be demonstrated. Regarding the Diuresewerte and creatinine clearance was at best a trend towards reduction. The laboratory parameters were within normal range. The application of furosemide induced here at CHI led to increased glomerulosclerosis, possibly associated with increased kidney weight. Thus here confirms a stimulatory action of renin and / or angiotensin II, a Furosemidtherapie [215, 216, 218]. For obvious nierenprotektiver effect in terms of interstitial fibrosis and the intrarenal vascular status without evidence of negative effects on renal function or on the investigated laboratory parameters, this seems to be questionable as the sole cause of increased mortality of rats furosemide [174]. An additional treatment of CHI with megestrol acetate led to a structural level to be significantly elevated in the glomerulosclerosis also increased kidney weight. The degree of interstitial fibrosis and renal arterial vascular status, however, remained unaffected. In consideration of renal function parameters, showed evidence of renal impairment on the basis of reduced Diuresewerte and elevated plasma creatinine budget. The different effects of <b>Megace</b> ® and <b>Megace</b> ® ES with sometimes contradictory tendencies both among themselves and in comparison with the control or Shamgruppen was particularly evident in a significant increase in albumin and Kreatininexkretion Shamtiere under the <b>Megace</b> ® ES. In the calculated creatinine clearance and renal parameters albumin - creatinine ratio also showed trends of increased values ​​of <b>Megace</b> ® ES influence. As causing an altered pathogenetic mechanism in the present CHI and interaction with furosemide should be adopted here. The supposed anti-inflammatory action, which should have resulted in improved cardiac function and improved survival among megestrol acetate, could not be detected in the kidney...|$|E
40|$|Megestrol acetate (17 α-acetoxy- 6 -methyl-pregna- 4, 6 -diene- 3, 20 -dione), {{also known}} as <b>megace,</b> is a {{synthetic}} orally active congener of the natural steroid progesterone. It is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 384. 5. Figure 1 depicts the structure of megestrol acetate. Synthetic progestins, such as megestrol acetate and medroxyprogesterone, {{are used in the}} palliative treatment of advanced breast and endometrial carcinomas. The patients are mostly postmenopausal women who have conditions that are inoperable, recurrent, and metastatic (PDR, 1992).

40|$|We report 3 {{patients}} where Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA = Provera) and Megestrol Acetate (<b>Megace)</b> in doses {{used for}} therapy of breast cancer, caused clinical hypercortisolism and Cushing's syndrome. Studies of the toxicity of Medroxyprogesterone Acetate list the commonest adverse events at 500 mg/day as weight gain, water retention, increased blood pressure, tremor, moon face, sweating, muscle cramps, vaginal bleeding and increased appetite. Glucocorticoid-like effects {{are seen in}} up to 30 % of patients treated for longer than 6 weeks with mostly large doses {{of the order of}} 1500 mg/day but Cushing's syndrome has been reported in patients taking 400 mg/day. Neither the glucocorticoid-like effects or Cushing's syndrome have been previously observed with Megestrol Acetate. In the elderly female population receiving progestogens for neoplastic disease the progestogen itself could be an appreciable cause of morbidity both by causing glucocorticoid-like effects and Cushing's syndrome but also by lack of awareness of the danger of sudden withdrawal of these compounds when the hypothalmic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is suppressed. The signs and symptoms could be easily overlooked unless appropriate testing for Cushing's syndrome is carried out. While the progestogen may have to be continued indefinitely a dose decrease may be feasible with reduction of morbidity...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} drugs {{have been used}} to stimulate {{appetite}} and produce weight gain in older persons. Historically, the agent first used was cyproheptadine acetate [1], which has proved to be minimally effective and can produce delirium. No controlled trials have been conducted in older persons. Ornithine oxoglutarate, a glutamine precursor, is an orexigenic agent that results in weight gain. It has been used successfully in Europe but is not available in the United States [2]. Two agents are widely used to stimulate appetite, namely, megestrol acetate and dronabinol. The effects of these agents are discussed in detail. Megestrol acetate Megestrol acetate (<b>Megace)</b> (Bristol Myers Squibb, Princeton, New Jersey) is a progestational agent that produces an increase in food intake. The mechanisms by which megestrol acetate increases appetite is uncertain but are thought to involve alterations in CNS neurotransmitters involved in the regulation of food intake [3]. In animals, estrogen decreases food intake, and progestational agents antagonize this effect. Megestrol acetate also antagonizes cytokine production [4]. Tumor necrosis factor–alpha (TNF-a), interleukin- 6, and ciliary neurotrophic factor are potent anorectic agents that also cause muscle loss [5 – 7]. Thus, the effect of megestrol acetate may involve, in part, the inhibition of the effects of cytokines on food intake and muscle. With use of megestrol acetate, weight gain has been reported in numerous patients with cancer-related anorexia and wasting [8]. Several randomized, pla-cebo-controlled trials have confirmed the effect of megestrol acetate on appetit...|$|E
40|$|We {{would like}} to share an unusual case of a 61 - year-old female with a known history of breast carcinoma. Her disease had progressed after a {{modified}} radical mastectomy and three years of tamoxifen therapy. She had been on <b>Megace</b> (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, New Jersey, U. S. A.) for the previous two years and complained of increasing shortness of breath. She was suspected to have pulmonary thromboembolism, as confirmed by a high-probability ventilation/perfusion scan. The patient was anticoagulated and discharged four days later. Three days after discharge she presented again with severe shortness of breath. A computed tomographic (CT) scan confirmed an embolus in the right pulmonary artery. The patient was discharged after a 10 -day course of high-dose intravenous heparin followed by coumadin therapy. The patient developed severe dyspnea 10 days later and was readmitted to the hospital. A repeat CT scan showed a large clot in the right pulmonary artery (Figure 1). Attempts to shrink the clot using peripheral intravenous urokinase and subsequent direct instillation of urokinase into the clot were unsuccessful. The patient underwent mechanical thrombolysis with a Possis angio jet device with aspiration of approximately 200 mL of soft, hemorrhagic material in the region of the thrombus. Onsite evaluation of the aspirate with air-dried, Diff-Quik 9 ̆ 6 stained smears showed malignant cells with a high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio and prominent nucleoli in a glandular architecture (Figure 2). Acinar differentiation was better evident on Papanicolaou-stained smears, which also showed numerous cells displaying intracytoplasmic mucin vacuoles (Figure 3). This was thought to be consistent with metastatic disease from the patient 9 ̆ 2 s known breast ductal primary. After the cytopathologic diagnosis, the patient underwent several cycles of chemotherapy with adriamycin and cytoxan. A bone scan subsequently displayed multiple vertebral lesions consistent with metastatic disease. The patient is currently being followed and has a guarded prognosis. While pulmonary and other visceral metastases are a common sequela in patients with breast cancer, metastatic disease presenting as a pulmonary embolus is extremely rare. Most of the suspected cases presenting as an intravascular mass/embolus have been metastatic renal cell carcinoma. 1 - 3 A rare case of metastatic choriocarcinoma presenting as a pulmonary embolus shortly after removal of the uterus and adnexa has also been reported. 4 Since metastatic tumor presenting as a pulmonary embolus is an extremely rare occurrence, the diagnosis is often not suspected clinically. However, in a patient with a history of pulmonary embolus refractory to conventional anticoagulation and thrombolytic therapy, the diagnosis of a metastatic tumor should always be entertained. Although extremely uncommon, a diagnosis of metastatic breast carcinoma presenting as a pulmonary embolus should be considered in a clinical setting of a known malignancy and vascular thrombus refractory to conventional anticoagulation therapy. Cytologic evaluation can be carried out on any aspirated material performed via venous catheterization. Such an evaluation, as in our case, can provide a rapid and accurate diagnosis, which was critical in the specific management of our patient and facilitated appropriate and early chemotherapy.
