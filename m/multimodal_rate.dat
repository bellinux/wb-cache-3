40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{performance}} of a multimodal interface under exerted conditions in a natural field setting. The subjects in the present study engaged in a strenuous activity while multimodally performing map-based tasks using handheld computing devices. This activity made the users breathe heavily and become fatigued {{during the course of the}} study. We found that {{the performance of}} both speech and gesture recognizers degraded as a function of exertion, while the overall <b>multimodal</b> success <b>rate</b> was stable. This stabilization is accounted for by the mutual disambiguation of modalities, which increases significantly with exertion. The system performed better for subjects with a greater level of physical fitness, as measured by their running speed, with more stable multimodal performance and a later degradation of speech and gesture recognition as compared with subjects who were less fit. The findings presented in this paper have a significant impact on design decisions for multimodal interfaces targeted towards highly mobile and exerted users in field environments...|$|R

40|$|As a new {{generation}} of multimodal/media systems begins to define itself, researchers are attempting to learn how to combine different modes into strategically integrated whole systems. In theory, well designed multimodal systems should be able to integrate complementary modalities in a manner that supports mutual disambiguation (MD) of errors and leads to more robust performance. In this study, over 2, 000 multimodal utterances by both native and accented speakers of English were processed by a multimodal system, and then logged and analyzed. The results confirmed that multimodal systems can indeed support significant levels of MD, and also higher levels of MD for the more challenging accented users. As a result, although speech recognition as a stand-alone performed far more poorly for accented speakers, their <b>multimodal</b> recognition <b>rates</b> did not differ from those of native speakers. Implications are discussed for the development of future multimodal architectures that can perform in a more robust and stable manner than individual recognition technologies. Also discussed is the design of interfaces that support diversity in tangible ways, and that function well under challenging real-world usage conditions, Keywords multimodal architecture, speech and pen input, recognitio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Methods for {{analyzing}} the completeness of earthquake historical cata-logs {{are applied to}} estimate which part of a historical catalog likely includes all earth-quakes of a certain magnitude class after a certain time in a given area. Current methods of catalog completeness estimation are not sufficient in case of long-term nonstationary seismicity data. Such methods typically require model presumptions, whereas the method described in this study does not. We develop a statistical approach based on a deviation criterion, which is applicable to stationary, nonstationary, and even <b>multimodal</b> nonstationary seismicity <b>rates.</b> The significance of the method is tested using synthetic catalogs extracted from stationary (exponential based on a Poisson process) and nonstationary (mixed bimodal Weibull–Weibull, gamma, and log-normal) distributions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the {{possibility}} of multimodal trivariate thematic maps by utilizing auditory and haptic displays. With two different modes of display (color only displays and multimodal displays with color, audio, and haptic), the completion time of tasks and the recall (retention) rate were measured in two separate experiments. In terms of the completion time, with minimal learning experience, participants could accomplish the tasks at the same level of speed in both modes. For the recall <b>rate,</b> <b>multimodal</b> displays have much higher recall rates. It is speculated that the natural quantitative hierarchies in auditory and haptic displays provide an advantage in the use of multimodal displays.

40|$|Reactive {{transport}} {{modeling of}} a permeable reactive barrier {{for the treatment}} of mine drainage was used to integrate a comprehensive data set including pore water chemistry and solid phase data from several sampling events over a 3 ̆e 3 -year time period. The simulations consider the reduction of sulfate by the organic carbon-based treatment material and the removal of sulfate and iron by precipitation of reduced mineral phases including iron monosulfides and siderite. Additional parameters constraining the model include dissolved H 2 S, alkalinity and pH, as well as a suite of solid phase S-fractions identified by extractions. Influences of spatial heterogeneity necessitated the use of a 2 -dimensional modeling approach. Simulating observed seasonal fluctuations and long-term changes in barrier reactivity required the use of temperature dependent rate coefficients and a <b>multimodal</b> Monod-type <b>rate</b> expression accounting for the variable reactivity of different organic carbon fractions. Simulated dissolved concentrations of SO 4, Fe, H 2 S, alkalinity and pH, as well as solid phase accumulations of reduced sulfur phases generally compare well to observed trends over 23 months. Spatial variations, seasonal fluctuations and the time-dependent decline in reactivity were also captured. The modeling results generally confirm, and further strengthen, the existing conceptual model for the site. Overall sulfate reduction and S-accumulation rates are constrained with confidence within a factor of 1. 5...|$|R

The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the {{possibility}} of multimodal bivariate thematic maps by utilizing auditory and haptic displays. With four different modes of display, the completion time of tasks and the recall (retention) rate were measured in two separate experiments. In terms of the completion time, haptic displays seem to interfere with other modalities. However, Color-Auditory displays performed similarly to Color-Color displays.

40|$|Recent times {{witnessed}} many advancements in {{the field}} of biometric and ultimodal biometric fields. This is typically observed in the area, of security, privacy, and forensics. Even for the best of unimodal biometric systems, it is often not possible to achieve a higher recognition <b>rate.</b> <b>Multimodal</b> biometric systems overcome various limitations of unimodal biometric systems, such as nonuniversality, lower false acceptance, and higher genuine acceptance rates. More reliable recognition performance is achievable as multiple pieces of evidence of the same identity are available. The work presented in this paper is focused on multimodal biometric system using fingerprint and iris. Distinct textual features of the iris and fingerprint are extracted using the Haar wavelet-based technique. A novel feature level fusion algorithm is developed to combine these unimodal features using the Mahalanobis distance technique. A support-vector-machine-based learning algorithm is used to train the system using the feature extracted. The performance of the proposed algorithms is validated and compared with other algorithms using the CASIA iris database and real fingerprint database.

The ability to conduct meaningful comparisons and assessments will be crucial to successful deployment and increasing biometric adoption. The best modality used as unimodal biometric systems are unable to fully address the problem of higher recognition <b>rate.</b> <b>Multimodal</b> biometric systems are able to mitigate some of the limitations encountered in unimodal biometric systems, such as non-universality, distinctiveness, non-acceptability, noisy sensor data, spoof attacks, and performance. More reliable recognition accuracy and performance are achievable as different modalities were being combined together and different algorithms or techniques were being used. The work presented in this paper focuses on a bimodal biometric system using face and fingerprint. An image enhancement technique (histogram equalization) is used to enhance the face and fingerprint images. Salient features of the face and fingerprint were extracted using the Gabor filter technique. A dimensionality reduction technique was carried out on both images extracted features using a principal component analysis technique. A feature level fusion algorithm (Mahalanobis distance technique) is used to combine each unimodal feature together. The performance of the proposed approach is validated and is effective.

40|$|Abstract [...] Traditional {{identity}} verification in computer systems are done based on Knowledge based and token based identification these {{are prone to}} fraud. Unfortunately, these may often be forgotten, disclosed or changed. A reliable and accurate identification/verification technique may be designed using biometric technologies. Biometric authentication employs unique combinations of measurable physical characteristics [...] fingerprint, facial features, iris of the eye, voice print, hand geometry, vein patterns, and so on [...] that cannot be readily imitated or forged by others. Unimodal biometric systems have variety of problems such as noisy data, intra-class variations, restricted degree of freedom, non-universality, spoof attacks, and unacceptable error <b>rates.</b> <b>Multimodal</b> biometrics refers the combination {{of two or more}} biometric modalities in a single identification system.

40|$|Perceptual {{information}} {{is important for}} the meaning of nouns. We present modality exclusivity norms for 485 Dutch nouns rated on visual, auditory, haptic, gustatory, and olfactory associations. We found these nouns are highly <b>multimodal.</b> They were <b>rated</b> most dominant in vision, and least in olfaction. A factor analysis identified two main dimensions: one loaded strongly on olfaction and gustation (reflecting joint involvement in flavor), and a second loaded strongly on vision and touch (reflecting joint involvement in manipulable objects). In a second study, we validated the ratings with similarity judgments. As expected, words from the same dominant modality were rated more similar than words from different dominant modalities; but – more importantly – this effect was enhanced when word pairs had high modality strength ratings. We further demonstrated the utility of our ratings by investigating whether perceptual modalities are differentially experienced in space, in a third study. Nouns were categorized into their dominant modality and used in a lexical decision experiment where the spatial position of words was either in proximal or distal space. We found words dominant in olfaction were processed faster in proximal than distal space compared to the other modalities, suggesting olfactory {{information is}} mentally simulated as “close” to the body. Finally, we collected ratings of emotion (valence, dominance, and arousal) to assess its role in perceptual space simulation, but the valence did not explain the data. So, words are processed differently depending on their perceptual associations, and strength of association is captured by modality exclusivity ratings...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Most {{randomized}} controlled trials of interventions {{designed to promote}} cancer screening, particularly those targeting poor and minority patients, enroll selected patients. Relatively {{little is known about}} the benefits of these interventions among unselected patients. Methods/Design "Get Screened" is an American Cancer Society-sponsored {{randomized controlled}} trial designed to promote mammography and colorectal cancer screening in a primary care practice serving low-income patients. Eligible patients who are past due for mammography or colorectal cancer screening are entered into a tracking registry and randomly assigned to early or delayed intervention. This 6 -month intervention is multimodal, involving patient prompts, clinician prompts, and outreach. At the time of the patient visit, eligible patients receive a low-literacy patient education tool. At the same time, clinicians receive a prompt to remind them to order the test and, when appropriate, a tool designed to simplify colorectal cancer screening decision-making. Patient outreach consists of personalized letters, automated telephone reminders, assistance with scheduling, and linkage of uninsured patients to the local National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection program. Interventions are repeated for patients who fail to respond to early interventions. We will compare rates of screening between randomized groups, as well as planned secondary analyses of minority patients and uninsured patients. Data from the pilot phase show that this <b>multimodal</b> intervention triples <b>rates</b> of cancer screening (adjusted odds ratio 3. 63; 95 % CI 2. 35 - 5. 61). Discussion This study protocol is designed to assess a multimodal approach to promotion of breast and colorectal cancer screening among underserved patients. We hypothesize that a multimodal approach will significantly improve cancer screening rates. The trial was registered at Clinical Trials. gov NCT 0081885...|$|R
