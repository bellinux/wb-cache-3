We consider two different scenarios for a {{measurement of the}} small mixing angle θ 13 with a mobile ¯νe source: a nuclear-powered ship, such as a submarine or an icebreaker, and a land-based scenario with a <b>mobile</b> <b>reactor.</b> The former setup can achieve a sensitivity to sin 2 2 θ 13 � 0. 003 at the 90 % confidence level, while the latter performs only slightly better than Double Chooz. Furthermore, we study the precision {{that can be achieved}} for the solar parameters, sin 2 2 θ 12 and ∆m 2 21, with a <b>mobile</b> <b>reactor</b> and with a conventional power station. With the <b>mobile</b> <b>reactor,</b> a precision slightly better than from current global fit data is possible, while with a power reactor, the accuracy can be reduced to less than 1 %. Such a precision is crucial for testing theoretical models, e. g. quark-lepton complementarity. ...|$|E

40|$|In a pipeless batch plant, <b>mobile</b> <b>reactors</b> are transported between process stations. Typical process steps {{performed}} at these stations are filling, measuring, feeding and cooling/heating. In this paper, three hybrid models of a pipeless batch plant {{for the production}} of copolymers have been developed. The dynamics of the chemical reactions are modelled in detail by means of mass balances. The time points at which the process steps are applied to the reactor contents are determined by the state of the reaction. The simulation results can be used to determine the quality of the produced products, the throughput and lead time of the plant, and the degree of occupation of the process stations and reactors. 1...|$|R
50|$|The AEC {{ultimately}} {{concluded that}} the probability of achieving {{the objectives of the}} Army Nuclear Power Program in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost was not high enough to justify continued funding of its portion of projects to develop small, stationary, and <b>mobile</b> <b>reactors.</b> Cutbacks in military funding for long-range research and development because of the Vietnam War led the AEC to phase out its support of the program in 1966. The costs of developing and producing compact nuclear power plants were so high that they could be justified only if the reactor had a unique capability and filled a clearly defined objective backed by DOD. After that, the Army's participation in nuclear power plant research and development efforts steadily declined and eventually stopped altogether.|$|R

Specifically discussed is the growing importance of: (1) a new international cargo transportation capability, and (2) the capability for development of resources in previously remote regions of the earth including the oceans and the Arctic. This report surveys present and potential systems (vehicles, remote stations, and machines) that would both provide these capabilities and require enough power to justify using <b>mobile</b> nuclear <b>reactor</b> power plants...|$|R

40|$|Many of {{the most}} {{pressing}} global challenges today {{and in the future}} center around the scarcity of sustainable energy and water sources. The innovative microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology addresses both as it utilizes bacteria to convert wastewaters into electricity. Advancing this technology requires {{a better understanding of the}} optimal materials, designs and conditions involved. The micro-sized MFC was recently developed to serve this need by providing a rapid testing device requiring only a fraction of the materials. Further, development of micro-liter scale MFCs has expanded into potential applications such as remote and self-sustained power sources as well as on-chip energy generators. By using microfabrication, the fabrication and assembly of microsized MFCs is potentially inexpensive and mass produced. The objective of the work within this dissertation was to explore and optimize the micro-sized MFC to maximize power and current generation towards the goal of a usable and application-oriented device. Micro-sized MFCs were examined and developed using four parameters/themes considered most important in producing a high power generating, yet usable device: Anode- The use of nano-engineered carbon nanomaterials, carbon nanotubes and graphene, as anode as well as testing semiconductor industry standard anode contact area materials for enhanced current production. 5 Cathode- The introduction of a membrane-less air cathode to eliminate the need for continuous chemical refills and making the entire device <b>mobile.</b> <b>Reactor</b> design- The testing of four different reactor designs (1 - 75 μLs) with various features intended to increase sustainability, cost-effectiveness, and usability of the microsized MFC. Fuels- The utilization of real-world fuels, such as industrial wastewaters and saliva, to power micro-sized MFCs. The micro-sized MFC can be tailored to fit a variety of applications by varying these parameters. The device with the highest power production here was designed to be an inexpensive and robust power source in applications like point-of-care diagnostics in developing countries. This 25 μL graphene nanomaterial anode, air cathode device in an inexpensive flexible rubber architecture was powered by saliva and achieved 3. 55 μW/cm 2 and 35. 2 W/m 3. The continued optimization of MFC technology promises many interesting and innovative applications...|$|E
40|$|In the {{interest}} of providing an economically sensible use for the copious small-diameter wood in Northern New Mexico, an economic study is performed focused on mobile pyrolysis. Mobile pyrolysis was selected for the study because transportation costs limit the viability of a dedicated pyrolysis plant, and the relative simplicity of pyrolysis compared to other technology solutions lends itself to <b>mobile</b> <b>reactor</b> design. A bench-scale pyrolysis system was used to study the wood pyrolysis process and to obtain performance data that was otherwise unavailable under conditions theorized to be optimal given the regional problem. Pyrolysis can convert wood to three main products: fixed gases, liquid pyrolysis oil and char. The fixed gases are useful as low-quality fuel, and may have sufficient chemical energy to power a mobile system, {{eliminating the need for}} an external power source. The majority of the energy content of the pyrolysis gas is associated with carbon monoxide, followed by light hydrocarbons. The liquids are well characterized in the historical literature, and have slightly lower heating values comparable to the feedstock. They consist of water and a mix of hundreds of hydrocarbons, and are acidic. They are also unstable, increasing in viscosity with time stored. Up to 60 % of the biomass in bench-scale testing was converted to liquids. Lower ({approx} 550 C) furnace temperatures are preferred because of the decreased propensity for deposits and the high liquid yields. A mobile pyrolysis system would be designed with low maintenance requirements, should be able to access wilderness areas, and should not require {{more than one or two}} people to operate the system. The techno-economic analysis assesses fixed and variable costs. It suggests that the economy of scale is an important factor, as higher throughput directly leads to improved system economic viability. Labor and capital equipment are the driving factors in the viability of the system. The break-even selling price for the baseline assumption is about $ 11 /GJ, however it may be possible to reduce this value by 20 - 30 % depending on other factors evaluated in the non-baseline scenarios. Assuming a value for the char co-product improves the analysis. Significantly lower break-even costs are possible in an international setting, as labor is the dominant production cost...|$|E
25|$|After a {{pause for}} {{evaluation}} of procedures, the Army continued its use of <b>reactors,</b> operating the <b>Mobile</b> Low-Power <b>Reactor</b> (ML-1), which started full power operation on February 28, 1963, becoming the smallest nuclear power plant on record to do so. This design was eventually abandoned after corrosion problems. While the tests had shown that nuclear power was likely to have lower total costs, the financial pressures of the Vietnam War caused the Army to favor lower initial costs and it stopped the development of its reactor program in 1965, although the existing reactors continued operating (MH-1A until 1977).|$|R
40|$|Mobile nuclear powerplants for {{applications}} other than large ships and submarines will require compact, lightweight reactors with especially stringent impact-safety design. The technical and economic feasibility that the broadening role of civilian nuclear power, in general, (land-based nuclear electric generating plants and nuclear ships) can extend to lightweight, safe mobile nuclear powerplants are examined. The paper discusses technical experience, identifies {{potential sources of}} technology for advanced concepts, cites the results of economic studies of mobile nuclear powerplants, and surveys future technical capabilities needed by examining the current use and projected needs for vehicles, machines, and habitats that could effectively use <b>mobile</b> nuclear <b>reactor</b> powerplants...|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} program {{was developed to}} analyze the transient afterheat temperature and pressure response of a <b>mobile</b> gas-cooled <b>reactor</b> power plant following impact. The program considers (in addition to the standard modes of heat transfer) fission product decay and transport, metal-water reactions, core and shield melting and displacement, and pressure and containment vessel stress response. Analyses were performed for eight cases (both deformed and undeformed models) to verify operability of the program options. The results indicated that for a 350 psi (241 n/sq cm) initial internal pressure, the containment vessel can survive over 100, 000 seconds following impact before creep rupture occurs. Recommendations were developed as to directions for redesign to extend containment vessel life...|$|R
40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that future {{exploration}} of the moon and Mars will mandate developments {{in many areas of}} technology. In particular, major advances will be required in planet surface power systems. Critical nuclear technology challenges that can enable strategic self-sufficiency, acceptable operational costs, and cost-effective space transportation goals for NASA exploration missions have been identified. Critical technologies for surface power systems include stationary and <b>mobile</b> nuclear <b>reactor</b> and radioisotope heat sources coupled to static and dynamic power conversion devices. These technologies can provide dramatic reductions in mass, leading to operational and transportation cost savings.

40|$|The use of {{pyrolysis}} {{to convert}} biomass into value-added {{products such as}} biochar and bio-oil holds great potential to facilitate fuels reduction projects, revitalize forest-dependent rural economies, and reduce net carbon emissions through fossil fuel offsets and carbon storage in biochar soil amendments. However, great uncertainty surrounds the use of pyrolysis technologies in the forest sector. Many of the knowledge gaps are related to understanding the economic and environmental performance of alternative technologies and operations, predicting feedstock flows and costs, and deploying equipment that can be effectively integrated into existing industrial infrastructure. Using {{a broad range of}} methods, this research provides: (1) financial analysis of mobile versus centralized pyrolysis operations; (2) spatially explicit models of biomass stocks, flows, and transportation costs under alternative land management scenarios; (3) assessment of energy and carbon balances associated with pyrolysis operations; and (4) productivity and financial analysis of in-woods pyrolysis based on data collected during field trials of a <b>mobile</b> pyrolysis <b>reactor</b> in Umpqua National Forest, USA.

50|$|Roy Morgan Research {{developed}} the Worm, which {{first appeared on}} live TV on Channel TEN's 'Face To Face' current affairs program. This leading Audience Response Measurement technology was colloquially described as The Worm because of the live graphs that snake their way over the television screen, displaying the audience's reactions to visual stimuli (like an Election Debate) in real-time. After being commissioned to provide The Worm to the Nine Network for a decade, Roy Morgan Research discovered that Nine had secretly registered The Worm as a trademark.

40|$|Critical {{assembly}} {{studies were}} conducted tc provide physics and engineering data {{to aid in}} developing the <b>Mobile</b> Low-Power <b>Reactor</b> (ML- 1). The ML- 1 -lA core was critical with 59 elements containing 17, 906. 71 g of U/sup 235 / and had an excess reactivity of 0. 381 x 10 /sup - 2 / DELTA k/k at a moderator temperature of 24. 91 deg C. The ratio of maximum element power to core-averaged power was approximately 1. 09. The ratio of maximum to core-averaged thermal flux was approximately 1. 10. At an 18 -deg separation, the shutdown worth of the cadmium-covered control-blade mock-up was 1. 14 x 10 /sup - 2 / DELTA k/k for a 69 element core. Radial and upper axial reflector-moderator void coefficients were - 0. 59 plus or minus 0. 07 and - 0. 36 S plus or minus 0. 015 x 10 /sup - 2 / DELTA k/ k. per in., respectively. Two lA production fuel elements were evaluated in the critical assembly core. The results predict that the production elements tested contained roughly the same fuel as the critical assembly element and an additional 772 g of stainless steel equivalent on the average. Radial power and neutron flux distributions were measured in a 19 -pin lB fuel element. Fairly uniform distributions were observed. Data to evaluate the thermal utilization of this element were obtained. (auth...|$|R

A number of empirical equations concerned with gravity flow of solid particles through an orifice have been proposed. However, little work has been done on a liquid-particle bed moving through a restricted end under imposed liquid pressure. Chon, Kovacic and Hammitt (1) have recently studied the system of liquid-particle two-phase concurrent downward flow through a tube with a restricting orifice end. Their studies were concerned with the application of this type of flow system to a <b>mobile</b> fuel nuclear <b>reactor</b> where fine uranium or uranium oxide partials are continuously carried into the top of the reactor core in the form of dilute slurries, allowed to settle on the bed already formed in the core, and are exhausted through the restricting orifices at the ends...|$|R
40|$|In October 2006, CH 2 M-WG Idaho {{completed}} the decontamination, decommissioning and demolition of the Loss-of-Fluid Test (LOFT) facility. The 30 -year-old research reactor, {{located at the}} Idaho National Laboratory site, posed significant challenges involving regulations governing the demolition of a historical facility, as well as worker safety issues associated with {{the removal of the}} reactor’s domed structure. The LOFT facility was located at the west end of Test Area North (TAN), built in the 1950 s to support the government’s aircraft nuclear propulsion program. When President Kennedy cancelled the nuclear propulsion program in 1961, TAN began to host various other activities. The LOFT reactor became part of the new mission. The LOFT facility, constructed between 1965 and 1975, was a scaled-down version of a commercial pressurized water reactor. Its design allowed engineers, scientists, and operators to create or re-create loss-of-fluid accidents (reactor fuel meltdowns) under controlled conditions. The LOFT dome provided containment for a relatively small, <b>mobile</b> test <b>reactor</b> that was moved {{into and out of the}} facility on a railroad car. The dome was roughly 21 meters (70 feet) in diameter and 30 meters (98 feet) in height. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission received the results from the accident tests and incorporated the data into commercial reactor operating codes. The facility conducted 38 experiments, including several small loss-of-coolant experiments designed to simulate events such as the accident that occurred at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, before the LOFT facility was closed. Through formal survey and research, the LOFT facility was determined to be a DOE Signature Property, as defined by the “INEEL Cultural Resource Management Plan, ” and thus eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. Decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) of the facility constituted an adverse effect on the historic property that require...|$|R
40|$|Acid mine {{drainage}} (AMD) {{is usually}} treated by air oxidation followed by addition of lime to precipitate metal hydroxides and calcium sulfate. Geo 2 Limited of Melbourne, Australia, has developed and patented a novel alternative precipitation {{scheme based on}} the formation of mixed valency, M(II) -M(III), hydroxide sulfate salts. When the composition of AMD has an appropriate ratio of Fe(II) :Fe(III), the green precipitate process provides a useful and more effective alternative to conventional liming. Many acidic mine drainage waters consist predominantly of Fe(II), particularly near their source, and it is these where the green precipitate (GP) process {{can be used with}} most positive effect. The GP process incorporates a pipe reactor to prevent or control oxidation. The characteristics of the precipitate and utility of the green precipitate process are described here in terms of underlying chemistry and innovative process equipment.

40|$|In {{the present}} study {{a model for the}} oxygen {{concentration}} profiles in a <b>mobile</b> bed biofilm <b>reactor</b> (MBBR) is proposed. By using a material with a large specific surface area (m 2 /m 3) high biological activity can be maintained using a relatively small reactor volume. Small parts made of special materials with density close to the water density, are immersed in the bioreactors. The biofilm carriers are kept in suspension and even mixed with the help of air bubbles generated by the aeration system. Water oxygenation is a mass transfer process of oxygen from gas/air to the liquid mass. It can be used in wastewater treatment in order to remove the organic matter, in the biological stage. The functioning of aerobic processes depends on the availability of sufficient quantities of oxygen. In wastewater treatment plants, submerged bubbles aeration is most frequently accomplished by dispersing air bubbles in the liquid. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the concentration of dissolved oxygen using mathematical modeling and numerical simulations. The aim of the study is to find the optimum dimension and position of the aeration pipes for maintaining the oxygen concentration in the limits indicated in the literature.
