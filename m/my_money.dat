500|$|Complaints {{about the}} {{programme}} also came from climate sceptics such as Martin Durkin, who said, [...] "The thing that disturbs me {{most is that}} the BBC has such a leviathan position … that if it decides {{that it is going}} to adopt climate change as a moral purpose, I have got a lot of trouble with that.

500|$|Rundgren {{points out}} that [...] "the themes of the songs were darker."

500|$|On October 8, 2002, Toni Braxton and {{her team}} {{released}} a statement claiming that Jay-Z's song [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] had stolen Braxton's idea to sample the 1996 Tupac Shakur song [...] "Me and My Girlfriend". Braxton sampled Shakur's song on the track [...] "Me & My Boyfriend", included on Braxton's album, More Than a Woman (2002).

500|$|His detractors {{include his}} {{extended}} {{family and his}} father's former secretary, Barbara Wilson.

Whenever Bamber visited the farm, there were arguments, she said. Tension had apparently increased {{in the weeks before}} the murders; she said Nevill had remarked to her about foreseeing a [...] "shooting accident". Bamber's girlfriend, Julie Mugford, alleged that he had talked about killing his family. A farm worker testified that Bamber had once said of Sheila: [...] "I'm not going to share <b>my</b> <b>money</b> with my sister." [...] In March 1985 he reportedly told a cousin: [...] "I could kill anybody...I could easily kill my parents". Bamber denied having said any of these things.|$|E

500|$|The {{ideas for}} [...] "One More Day" [...] {{began to develop}} almost two years before its release, at one of Marvel's {{creative}} summits for creators and editors. Quesada, Straczynski, Brian Michael Bendis, Mark Millar, Jeph Loeb, Tom Brevoort and Axel Alonso developed the concept between them, and Ed Brubaker and Dan Slott added more at the next summit. [...] "One More Day" [...] was announced as the concluding storyline of Straczynski's run on Amazing Spider-Man in early 2007, and Quesada was named as the artist for the storyline. Although Quesada had become more selective in choosing projects to do as an artist since becoming editor-in-chief, he felt compelled to do the art for One More Day because he felt {{very close to the}} story, and because since he had been talking about the project for so long, he felt he [...] "needed to put <b>my</b> <b>money</b> where my mouth is." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{introduction}} {{consists of}} the repeated {{use of the word}} na. Stefani reaches her highest note of the song, E5, as part of a trichord and her lowest, G3, during this section. After the first chorus, Stefani discusses dreams of wealth and luxury, and she namechecks fashion designers Vivienne Westwood and John Galliano. Stefani commented that the references were not product placement but that she included them [...] "because I think they're rad and want to talk about them. [...] I'd give all <b>my</b> <b>money</b> to [...] and buy all her clothes!" [...] A bridge, in which Stefani's voice is overdubbed, precedes the second chorus. During the second verse Stefani discusses her Harajuku Girls, and she then repeats the bridge. Following Eve's rap, Stefani sings the chorus and closes the song with a coda, which, like the introduction, consists of repeating the word na.|$|E
500|$|For the album, Cher {{collaborated with}} several musicians {{including}} Stargate, Chicane and previous collaborator Mark Taylor.
