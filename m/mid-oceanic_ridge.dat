25|$|A {{fore-arc}} {{setting for}} most ophiolites also solves the otherwise-perplexing {{problem of how}} oceanic lithosphere can be emplaced on top of continental crust. It appears that continental accretion sediments, if carried by the downgoing plate into a subduction zone, will jam it up and cause subduction to cease, resulting in the rebound of the accretionary prism with fore-arc lithosphere (ophiolite) on top of it. Ophiolites with compositions comparable with hotspot-type eruptive settings or normal <b>mid-oceanic</b> <b>ridge</b> basalt are rare, and those examples are generally strongly dismembered in subduction zone accretionary complexes.|$|E
25|$|At the mid-oceanic ridges, two tectonic plates diverge {{from one}} another as new oceanic crust is formed by the cooling and solidifying of hot molten rock. Because the crust is very thin at these ridges due to {{the pull of the}} tectonic plates, the release of {{pressure}} leads to adiabatic expansion (without transfer of heat or matter) and the partial melting of the mantle, causing volcanism and creating new oceanic crust. Most divergent plate boundaries are {{at the bottom of the}} oceans; therefore, most volcanic activity on the Earth is submarine, forming new seafloor. Black smokers (also known as deep sea vents) are evidence of this kind of volcanic activity. Where the <b>mid-oceanic</b> <b>ridge</b> is above sea-level, volcanic islands are formed; for example, Iceland.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Electromagnetic {{exploration}} is a geophysical {{method for}} examining the Earth’s interior through observations of natural or artificial electromagnetic field fluctuations. The method {{has been in}} practice for more than 70 years, and 40 {{years ago it was}} first applied to ocean areas. During the past few decades, there has been noticeable progress in the methods of instrumentation, data acquisition (observation), data processing and inversion. Due to this progress, applications of this method to oceanic regions have revealed electrical features of the oceanic upper mantle down to depths of several hundred kilometers for different geologic and tectonic environments such as areas around <b>mid-oceanic</b> <b>ridges,</b> areas around hot-spot volcanoes, subduction zones, and normal ocean areas between <b>mid-oceanic</b> <b>ridges</b> and subduction zones. All these results estimate the distribution of the electrical conductivity in the oceanic mantle, which is key for understanding the dynamics and evolution of the Earth together with different physical properties obtained through other geophysical methods such as seismological techniques...|$|R
2500|$|The {{interior}} of Earth, {{similar to the}} other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers of different composition. The mantle is a layer between the crust and the outer core. Earth's mantle is a silicate rocky shell with an average thickness of [...] The mantle makes up about 84% of Earth's volume. It is predominantly solid but in geological time it behaves as a very viscous fluid. The mantle encloses the hot core rich in iron and nickel, which makes up about 15% of Earth's volume. Past episodes of melting and volcanism at the shallower levels of the mantle have produced a thin crust of crystallized melt products near the surface. Information about the structure and composition of the mantle has been obtained from geophysical investigation and from direct geoscientific analyses of Earth mantle-derived xenoliths and mantle that has been exposed by <b>mid-oceanic</b> <b>ridge</b> spreading.|$|E
2500|$|Earth's volcanoes {{occur because}} its crust is broken into 17 major, rigid tectonic plates that float on a hotter, softer layer in its mantle. Therefore, on Earth, volcanoes are {{generally}} found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging, {{and most are}} found underwater. For example, a <b>mid-oceanic</b> <b>ridge,</b> such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates whereas the Pacific Ring of Fire has volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates. Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the crust's plates, e.g., in the East African Rift and the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and Rio Grande Rift in North America. This type of volcanism falls {{under the umbrella of}} [...] "plate hypothesis" [...] volcanism. Volcanism away from plate boundaries has also been explained as mantle plumes. These so-called [...] "hotspots", for example Hawaii, are postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs with magma from the core–mantle boundary, 3,000km deep in the Earth. [...] Volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another.|$|E

50|$|Harry Hess {{proposed}} the sea-floor spreading hypothesis in 1960 (published in 1962). According to Hess, seafloor was created at <b>mid-oceanic</b> <b>ridges</b> by the convection of the earth's mantle, pushing and spreading the older crust {{away from the}} ridge. Geophysicist Frederick John Vine and the Canadian geologist Lawrence W. Morley independently realized that if Hess’s seafloor spreading theory was correct, then the rocks surrounding the <b>mid-oceanic</b> <b>ridges</b> should show symmetric patterns of magnetization reversals using newly collected magnetic surveys. Both of Morley's letters to Nature (February 1963) and Journal of Geophysical Research (April 1963) were rejected, hence Vine and his PhD adviser at Cambridge University, Drummond Hoyle Matthews, were first to publish the theory in 1963. Some colleagues were skeptical of the hypothesis because of the numerous assumptions made—seafloor spreading, geomagnetic reversals, and remnant magnetism—all hypotheses that were still not widely accepted. The Vine-Matthews hypothesis describes the magnetic reversals of oceanic crust. Further evidence for this hypothesis came from Cox et al. (1967) when he measured the remnant magnetization of lavas from land sites. Walter C. Pitman offered further evidence with a remarkably symmetric profile from the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge.|$|R

50|$|In plate tectonics, a {{divergent}} boundary or divergent {{plate boundary}} (also {{known as a}} constructive boundary or an extensional boundary) is a linear feature that exists between two tectonic plates that are moving away from each other. Divergent boundaries within continents initially produce rifts which eventually become rift valleys.

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Paleozoic Era, about 540 million years ago, most of the continental mass on Earth was clustered around the south pole as the paleocontinent Gondwana. The exception was formed by a number of smaller continents, such as Laurentia and Baltica. The Paleozoic ocean between Gondwana, Laurentia and Baltica is called the Iapetus Ocean. The northern edge of Gondwana had been dominated by the Cadomian orogeny during the Ediacaran period. This orogeny formed a cordillera-type volcanic arc where oceanic crust subducted below Gondwana. When a <b>mid-oceanic</b> <b>ridge</b> subducted under an oblique angle, extensional basins developed along the northern margin of Gondwana. During the late Cambrian to Early Ordovician these extensional basins had evolved a rift running along the northern edge of Gondwana. The rift in its turn evolved into a <b>mid-oceanic</b> <b>ridge</b> that separated small continental fragments such as Avalonia and Carolina from the main Gondwanan land mass.|$|E

25|$|Mantle convection, {{the process}} that drives plate tectonics, {{is a result of}} heat flow from the Earth's {{interior}} to the Earth's surface. It involves the creation of rigid tectonic plates at <b>mid-oceanic</b> <b>ridges.</b> These plates are destroyed by subduction into the mantle at subduction zones. During the early Archean (about 3.0Ga) the mantle was much hotter than today, probably around , so convection in the mantle was faster. Although a process similar to present-day plate tectonics did occur, this would have gone faster too. It is likely that during the Hadean and Archean, subduction zones were more common, and therefore tectonic plates were smaller.|$|R

5000|$|A paper {{written by}} Gerya theorizes that the {{creation}} of the transform faults between the ridges of the <b>mid-oceanic</b> <b>ridge</b> is attributed to rotated and stretched sections of the <b>mid-oceanic</b> <b>ridge.</b> This occurs {{over a long period of}} time with the spreading center or ridge slowly deforming from a straight line to a curved line. Finally, fracturing along these planes forms transform faults. As this takes place, the fault changes from a normal fault with extensional stress to a strike slip fault with lateral stress. In the study done by Bonatti & Crane, peridotite and gabbro rocks were discovered in the edges of the transform ridges. These rocks are created deep inside the Earth’s mantle and then rapidly exhumed to the surface. [...] This evidence helps to prove that new seafloor is being created at the mid-oceanic ridges and further supports the theory of plate tectonics.|$|E

50|$|Transform faults move {{differently}} than a strike-slip fault at the <b>mid-oceanic</b> <b>ridge.</b> Instead of the ridges {{moving away from}} each other, like other strike-slip faults, transform fault ridges will stay in the same fixed location, and the new ocean seafloor being created at the ridges is {{pushed away from the}} ridge.

30|$|According to {{the theory}} of plate {{tectonics}} proposed in the late 1960 ’s, the Earth’s surface is covered by about ten rigid plates, which are generated at <b>mid-oceanic</b> <b>ridges,</b> move to oceanic trenches, and there subduct into the mantle. A theory of plate tectonics explains most geologic phenomena such as seismicity, volcanism, and magnetic striping of the ocean-floor. However, the theory of plate tectonics explains only the orogenic phenomena occurring in the uppermost several hundred of kilometers of the Earth’s interior.
