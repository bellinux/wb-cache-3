5|$|Some USB devices require <b>more</b> <b>power</b> than is {{permitted}} by the specifications {{for a single}} port. This is common for external hard and optical disc drives, and generally for devices with motors or lamps. Such devices can use an external power supply, which is allowed by the standard, or use a dual-input USB cable, one input of which is used for power and data transfer, the other solely for power, which makes the device a non-standard USB device. Some USB ports and external hubs can, in practice, supply <b>more</b> <b>power</b> to USB devices than required by the specification but a standard-compliant device may not depend on this.|$|E
5|$|Some devices, when {{plugged into}} {{charging}} ports, draw even <b>more</b> <b>power</b> (10watts at 2.1amperes) than the Battery Charging Specification allows — The iPad {{is one such}} device. Barnes & Noble NOOK Color devices also require a special charger that runs at 1.9amperes.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{benchmarks}} on {{its official}} website, the Fastra II is faster and <b>more</b> <b>power</b> efficient than its competitors, including the Fastra I and the Tesla C1060 video card. The benchmarks {{were performed on}} the Fastra II, the Fastra I, a 512-core cluster (consisting of Opteron CPUs), an Nvidia Tesla C1060 workstation card on an Intel Core i7 940 CPU, and on an Intel Core i7 940 CPU itself. The Fastra II is over three {{times faster than the}} Fastra I in CT slice reconstruction speed. Although the Fastra II consumes <b>more</b> <b>power</b> than the Fastra I, it's nearly 3 times as energy efficient as the Fastra I, and over 300 times as energy efficient as the 512-core cluster. The video cards run at 37 degrees Celsius when idle, and at 60 degrees Celsius at full load.|$|E

5|$|At this point, Khánh had {{not spoken}} up and allowed the {{impression}} that the moves had been made without his consultation or against his will, and an attempt on the part of other officers to take power themselves.

5|$|By 1971, both Egypt and Saudi Arabia had {{disengaged}} from Yemen. South Yemen {{formed a}} connection with the Soviet Union. In September 1971, Amri resigned after murdering a photographer in San'a, and <b>more</b> <b>power</b> was given to Iryani, the effective President. By then, the royalists were integrated into the new republic, except for al-Badr's family, and a consultative Council was established. Clashes along {{the border between the}} states rose, and in 1972 a small war broke.|$|E

5|$|In 1659, {{shortly before}} the {{restoration}} of the monarchy, the Protector's Council was abolished. Charles II restored the Royal Privy Council, but he, like previous Stuart monarchs, chose to rely on a small group of advisers.

5|$|The IEEE 802.3af Power over Ethernet (PoE) {{standard}} specifies a {{more elaborate}} power negotiation scheme than powered USB. It operates at 48VDC and can supply <b>more</b> <b>power</b> (up to 12.95W, PoE+ 25.5W) over a cable up to 100meters compared to USB2.0, which provides 2.5W {{with a maximum}} cable length of 5meters. This has made PoE popular for VoIP telephones, security cameras, wireless access points, and other networked devices within buildings. However, USB is cheaper than PoE provided that the distance is short and power demand is low.|$|E
5|$|Turbines offered <b>more</b> <b>power</b> than {{reciprocating}} engines for {{the same}} volume of machinery. This, along with a guarantee on the new machinery from the inventor, Charles Parsons, persuaded the Royal Navy to use turbines in Dreadnought. It is often said that turbines had the additional benefits of being cleaner and more reliable than reciprocating engines. By 1905, new designs of reciprocating engine were available which were cleaner and more reliable than previous models.|$|E

5|$|A mayor-council {{government}} {{has been in place}} in Tulsa since 1989 when the city converted from a city commission government deemed wasteful and less efficient. Since the change, Tulsa mayors have been given <b>more</b> <b>power</b> in accordance with a strong mayoral system and have greater control of a more consolidated array of governmental branches. Plurality voting is used to elect mayors, who serve a term in office of four years. The present mayor of Tulsa is Republican G. T. Bynum who won the 2016 mayoral election and took office on December 5, 2016. Another Tulsa political figure, Jim Inhofe, who now represents Oklahoma in the United States Senate, served as the mayor of Tulsa early in his political career.|$|E
5|$|Acting on {{recommendations}} from Beckham's commission, legislators helped offset the lost {{revenue from the}} sales tax by raising excise taxes; of particular import was the tax on whiskey, which {{was made possible by}} the repeal of Prohibition in 1935. Legislators also enacted the state's first income tax during the session. Chandler further proposed to achieve savings through the Governmental Reorganization Act of 1936. The bill realized significant cost savings by restructuring the state government, reducing the number of boards and commissions in the executive branch from 133 to 22. Critics pointed out that the act also centralized <b>more</b> <b>power</b> {{in the hands of the}} governor and accused Chandler of ulterior motives in supporting it.|$|E

5|$|Alexius Slav's {{marriage}} to the daughter of Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders in 1209 was potentially a great danger to Boril, who could be facing their joint forces. Fearing such a coalition, Boril approached Strez, {{who was at the}} time gaining <b>more</b> <b>power</b> and was close to complete independence from Serbia. Strez agreed to a union with his former enemy, though only after Boril reconfirmed his complete autonomy. Strez eliminated the remaining Serbian troops in his lands in an act that the Serbs saw as devil-inspired treason. It is not impossible that Boril persuaded Strez through military action, though {{it is more likely that}} the union was achieved through negotiations.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, {{the wind}} {{industry}} in the USA is able to produce <b>more</b> <b>power</b> at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades, capturing the faster winds at higher elevations. This has opened up new opportunities and in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, the price of power from wind turbines built 300 feet to 400 {{feet above the ground}} can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal. Prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been increasing the amount of wind energy in their portfolio, saying it is their cheapest option.|$|E
