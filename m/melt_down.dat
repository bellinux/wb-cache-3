They {{were excluded from}} most of the rules imposed on other noble castes and exempted from fanampoana (forced labor in lieu of monetary tax payment). Instead, they were made responsible for maintaining a key dike that supported irrigation of the capital's rice paddies, producing the silk used to make the king's clothing, and conscripting soldiers for the king's army. They were also responsible for gathering used hoes for the royal blacksmiths to <b>melt</b> <b>down</b> and then supervise the artisans as the metal was crafted into nails, shackles and other forged objects.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the output}} of copper {{currency}} had expanded immensely by 1085, some fifty copper mines were shut down between the years 1078 and 1085. Although there were on average more copper mines found in Northern Song China {{than in the previous}} Tang dynasty, this case was reversed during the Southern Song with a sharp decline and depletion of mined copper deposits by 1165. Even though copper cash was abundant in the late 11th century, Chancellor Wang Anshi's tax substitution for corvée labor and government takeover of agricultural finance loans meant that people now had to find additional cash, driving up the price of copper money which would become scarce. To make matters worse, large amounts of government-issued copper currency exited the country via international trade, while the Liao dynasty and Western Xia actively pursued the exchange of their iron-minted coins for Song copper coins. As evidenced by an 1103 decree, the Song government became cautious about its outflow of iron currency into the Liao Empire when it ordered that the iron was to be alloyed with tin in the smelting process, thus depriving the Liao of a chance to <b>melt</b> <b>down</b> the currency to make iron weapons.|$|E

25|$|The feud between The Undertaker and Kama (a {{member of}} Ted Dibiase's Million Dollar Corporation) began at WrestleMania XI. The Undertaker's manager was Paul Bearer, and Kama's manager was Ted DiBiase. Undertaker was portrayed as the face, and Kama as the heel. At WrestleMania XI, during Undertaker's match with King Kong Bundy, Kama {{ran out to}} the ring, {{attacked}} Bearer, and stole the urn (an object which, in storylines, gives The Undertaker supernatural power) for DiBiase. Immediately afterward, Kama declared (in an interview with Jim Ross) his intention to <b>melt</b> <b>down</b> the urn. The urn was revealed to have become a gold necklace, first worn by Kama prior to his match with Scott Taylor on the April 10 episode of Raw. On the April 23 episode of Action Zone, The Undertaker defeated Sycho Sid, another member of The Million Dollar Corporation. On the May 7 episode of Wrestling Challenge, a black wreath was left at ringside for Kama. Kama attacked the wreath and, after defeating Buck Zumhofe, stuffed part of it into Zumhofe's mouth. Another black wreath was left at ringside for Kama on the June 12 Raw. After defeating jobber David Haskins, Kama again attacked the wreath, only to realise it was a mannequin. Both The Undertaker and Kama participated in the 1995 King of the Ring tournament. On the pay-per-view, a black wreath was ringside {{for the whole of}} Kama's quarterfinal match with Shawn Michaels, which ended in a draw. Toward the end of The Undertaker's quarterfinal contest with Mabel, Undertaker was thrown into the referee. While the referee was down, Kama interfered by kicking Undertaker in the face. Mabel followed up with a leg drop, pinning Undertaker to win the match. The Undertaker chased Kama backstage after the bout. The two continued to wrestle together in matches at house shows, with the two facing each other in preparation for their SummerSlam bout. Wreaths continued to be left ringside during Kama's matches, and Kama continued to attack them. On the August 21, 1995 Raw, (storyline) WWF president Gorilla Monsoon announced the match between Undertaker and Kama would be a casket match.|$|E

500|$|Congress {{abolished}} the twenty-cent piece on May 2, 1878. [...] The previous day, Linderman {{had ordered the}} mints to <b>melt</b> <b>down</b> twenty-cent pieces on hand, for recoinage into other denominations. By then, forces for silver coinage had been victorious in passing the Bland–Allison Act, requiring the government to purchase large quantities of silver bullion, and strike it into dollars. [...] The piece continued to circulate in the West for a few years, but by 1890 was rarely seen. Of the 1,351,540 twenty-cent pieces minted for circulation, over a third were melted by the government between 1895 and 1954, most heavily in 1933. The least expensive twenty-cent piece, according to the 2014 edition of R. S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins (the Red Book), is the 1875-S, listed at $110 in good-4 condition. According to commentary in the Red Book, the twenty-cent piece failed because [...] "the public was confused over the coin's similarity to the quarter dollar, which was better established as a foundation of American commerce", that fractional currency satisfied the need for small change in the East, and because [...] "the twenty-cent piece was essentially just a substitute for two dimes".|$|E

2500|$|Historian Francis Loraine Petre {{concluded}} that Stettin's surrender was [...] "shameful". Its adequate garrison and supplies {{would have allowed}} it to sustain a siege. Even if the fortress was indefensible, there was nothing preventing the troops from crossing to the east bank of the Oder, joining their Russian allies, and continuing the war. Lannes wrote to Napoleon, [...] "The Prussian army is {{in such a state}} of panic that the mere appearance of a Frenchman is enough to make it lay down its arms." [...] Napoleon congratulated Murat, [...] "My compliments on the capture of Stettin; if your light cavalry thus takes fortified towns, I must disband the engineers and <b>melt</b> <b>down</b> my heavy artillery." ...|$|E

The US military often used its Conex containers as on-site storage, or easily transportable housing for command staff and medical clinics. Nearly all of over 150,000 Conex containers shipped to Vietnam remained in country, primarily as storage or other mobile facilities. Permanent or semi-permanent placement of containers for storage is common.

[...] In it he said, [...] "As a result of the disaster at Fukushima, I am no longer nuclear-neutral. I now support the technology." [...] He continued, [...] "A crappy old plant with inadequate safety features was hit by a monster earthquake and a vast tsunami. The electricity supply failed, knocking out the cooling system. The reactors began to explode and <b>melt</b> <b>down.</b> The disaster exposed a familiar legacy of poor design and corner-cutting. Yet, as far as we know, no one has yet received a lethal dose of radiation." ...|$|E

2500|$|They issued {{their debut}} studio album, Under a Different Sky, on Um & Ah Records and MGM Distribution in 2001. It was co-produced by the duo with Anthony Lycenko and Ben McCarthy. They {{used a variety}} of session musicians {{including}} Lycenko on electric and acoustic guitars; McCarthy on keyboards, piano, electric and bass guitars; and Silas Palmer on violin. The Courier-Mails Noel Mengel noted the duo showed [...] " [...] ebullient personalities and infectious harmonies" [...] when performing, while the album displayed [...] "ffervescent folk-pop ... They can rock it up, with an '80's punk-pop feel". Domenica Acitelli of Revolver caught their performance in May that year at Club Acoustica in Sydney, she noted their [...] "elenting, prolific <b>melt</b> <b>down</b> harmonies merged with an upbeat folk/rock lilt to the tunes dressed in front of a poised yet carefree room.

2500|$|The army {{defending}} Constantinople {{was relatively}} small, totaling about 7,000 men, 2,000 {{of whom were}} foreigners. At {{the onset of the}} siege, probably fewer than 50,000 people were living within the walls, including the refugees from the surrounding area. [...] Turkish commander Dorgano, who was in Constantinople in the pay of the Emperor, was also guarding one of the quarters of the city on the seaward side with the Turks in his pay. These Turks kept loyal to the Emperor and perished in the ensuing battle. The defending army's Genoese corps were well trained and equipped, {{while the rest of the}} army consisted of small numbers of well-trained soldiers, armed civilians, sailors and volunteer forces from foreign communities, and finally monks. The garrison used a few small-calibre artillery bullets, which nonetheless proved ineffective. The rest of the city repaired walls, stood guard on observation posts, collected and distributed food provisions, and collected gold and silver objects from churches to <b>melt</b> <b>down</b> into coins to pay the foreign soldiers.|$|E
2500|$|Under {{the command}} of Lieutenant-Colonel John Jennings, the four under-strength companies, {{approximately}} 200 men in all, withstood three assaults on the castle. In addition to being outnumbered, the garrison was short of ammunition, having to <b>melt</b> <b>down</b> their buttons to make bullets. By the time the French made their third attack, the defenders had expended all their ammunition and were left with rocks and bayonets. After the third attempt was beaten back, Colonel Jennings was forced to seek terms. After meeting with the French commander, Jennings and his men were allowed to surrender the castle, give their parole, retaining their arms and colours. The French, in return, promised not to plunder the town of Carrickfergus. Although the regiment surrendered the castle, the French squadron which had landed the force was destroyed by the Royal Navy in an action near the Mull of Galloway. An investigation of the defence of Carrickfergus proclaimed that the men [...] "behav'd like Lyons". The Irish Parliament voted a thanks to the Regiment and Carrickfergus presented the officers with silver cups.|$|E
