The layer deposition process has been optimized for low defects, by application of a vendor-supplied but highly modified ion-beam sputter deposition system. This system is fully automated using SMIF technology to obtain the lowest possible environmental- and handling-added defect levels. Originally designed to coat 150 mm substrates, it was upgraded in July, 1999 to 200 mm and has coated runs of over 50 substrates at a time with median added defects > 100 nm below 0. 05 /cm{sup 2 }. These improvements have resulted {{from a number of}} ion-beam sputter deposition system modifications, upgrades, and operational changes, which will be discussed. Success in defect reduction is highly dependent upon defect detection, characterization, and cross-platform positional registration. We have made significant progress in adapting and extending commercial tools to this purpose, and have identified the surface scanner detection limits for different defect classes, and the signatures of false counts and non-printable scattering anomalies on the mask blank.

40|$|In situ atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) {{was used}} to study the growth behaviour of anglesite (PbSO 4) monolayers on the celestite (001) face. Growth was promoted by exposing the celestite cleavage surfaces to aqueous solutions that were supersaturated with respect to anglesite. The solution supersaturation, βang, was varied from 1. 05 to 3. 09 (where βang = a(Pb 2 +) •a(SO 42 -) /Ksp,ang). In this range of supersaturation, two single anglesite monolayers (~ 3. 5 Å in height each) from pre-existent celestite steps were grown. However, for solution supersaturation {{of the values of}} βang < 1. 89 +- 0. 06, subsequent <b>multilayer</b> <b>growth</b> is strongly inhibited. AFM observations indicate that the inhibition of a continuous layer-by-layer growth of anglesite on the celestite (001) face is due to the in-plane strain generated by the slight difference between the anglesite and celestite lattice parameters (i. e. the linear misfits are lower than 1. 1 %). The minimum supersaturation required to overcome the energy barrier for <b>multilayer</b> <b>growth</b> gave an estimate of the in-plane strain energy: 11. 4 +/- 0. 6 mJ/m 2.

First, we review and augment recent developments in submonolayer nucleation theory for general critical size i (above which islands are effectively stable against dissociation). We discuss choices of 2 ̆ 2 capture numbers 2 ̆ 2 for aggregation of adatoms with islands, and ramifications for island density scaling with deposition flux and substrate temperature. We also characterize a 2 ̆ 2 direct 2 ̆ 2 transition from critical size i = 1 to a well-defined regime of i = 3 scaling, with increasing temperature, for sufficiently strong adatom-adatom bonding. We note that there exists no well-defined regime of integer i 3 ̆e 3.

Earlier {{it was shown}} that such nodules were composed of SMCs with the distinctive properties of small cell size, low adhesivity, and scarce or no fibronectin and filamentous actin, features which may also characterize tumor cells. Similar properties could be induced by cultivation of SMCs in aggregates, indicating modulation of SMCs to a distinct "multilayered" phenotype, rather than selection of variant SMCs with preference for <b>multilayered</b> <b>growth.</b> Transfer of SMCs to a three-dimensional arrangement by agglomeration to nodules, "spheroids," by seeding of SMCs on low-adhesive substratum, like agarose, was followed by signs of SMC injury with focal autodigestion and with loss of material from the cells, which to some extent was deposited extracellularly, transition to foam cells with cholesterol accumulation mainly as cholesteryl esters, and eventually decrease in cell size. Identically treated fibroblasts showed similar, but much less pronounced, changes and were largely protected by whole blood serum, in contrast to SMCs. The {{results indicate that the}} "multilayered" SMC type can be conceived of as a postinjury phenotypic state which is preceded by overt cellular injury and transition to foam cells in conjunction with sudden transfer to three-dimensional arrangement in spheroids.

We show that <b>multilayered</b> <b>growth</b> is not a constitutive feature of cultured SMC, and that beta-type transforming growth factor (TGF-beta) is the primary determinant of <b>multilayered</b> <b>growth</b> and the hill-and-valley pattern of organization diagnostic for SMC in culture. TGF-beta inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, the serum- or platelet- derived growth factor-mediated proliferation of these cells in two- dimensional culture, but only when cells were plated at subconfluent densities. The ability of TGF-beta to inhibit SMC growth was inversely correlated to plating cell density. When SMC were plated at monolayer density (5 X 10 (4) cells/cm 2) to allow maximal cell-to-cell contact, TGF-beta potentiated cell growth. This differential response of SMC to TGF-beta {{may contribute to the}} hill-and-valley pattern of organization. Unlike its effect on other cell types, TGF-beta did not enhance the synthesis of fibronectin or its incorporation into the extracellular matrix.

40|$|Theoretical {{aspects of}} crystal growth far from {{equilibrium}} are investigated. The study of temporal correlations in crystal growth represents {{a major part}} of the study. A class of growth processes in which surface diffusion is of crucial importance (molecular beam epitaxy, MBE) is studied in various contexts. A detailed study of MBE growth in the submonolayer regime is presented. These results are of crucial importance for a correct interpretation of multilayer studies, since studies on <b>multilayer</b> <b>growth</b> depend on the knowledge of quantities in the submonolayer regime. The damping of growth oscillations, which are the hallmark of layer-by-layer growth, is studied. A theory for how the damping time depends on the growth conditions is presented, along with the introduction of the layer coherence length that emerges in this context. Modern techniques of crystal surface manipulation allow to imprint structures on the nanometer scale on surfaces. The question of how long such a structure survives in a growth process is dealt with. The dependence of the life time of the pattern on its typical length scale and the growth conditions is discussed. The excess energy barrier that an atom experiences upon hopping down an island can have a marked influence on the growth morphology.

The thermal behaviour of CH 3 CN on H 2 O and on the silica surface is governed by a balance of intermolecular forces and shows evidence for wetting of the silica surface (formation of a distinct first adsorption layer before <b>multilayer</b> <b>growth)</b> and of dewetting or island formation on the H 2 O surface (<b>multilayer</b> <b>growth</b> for all CH 3 CN exposures).
