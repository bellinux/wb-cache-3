50|$|In any {{magnetic}} pickup, a vibrating guitar string, magnetized by a fixed magnet {{within the}} pickup induces an alternating voltage across its coil(s). However, wire coils also make excellent antennae {{and are therefore}} sensitive to electromagnetic interference caused by alternating magnetic fields from mains wiring (<b>mains</b> hum) and <b>electrical</b> appliances like transformers, motors, and computer screens. Guitar pickups reproduce this noise, which can be quite audible, sounding like a constant hum or buzz. This is most noticeable when using distortion, fuzz, compressors, or other effects which reduce the signal-to-noise ratio and therefore amplify the unwanted interference relative to the signal from the strings.|$|R

5000|$|A radio {{transmitter}} is an electronic circuit which transforms electric power from a battery or <b>electrical</b> <b>mains</b> into a radio frequency alternating current, which reverses direction millions to billions of times per second.

5000|$|Ground or {{earth in}} a <b>mains</b> (AC power) <b>electrical</b> wiring {{system is a}} {{conductor}} that provides a low-impedance path to the earth to prevent hazardous voltages from appearing on equipment (high voltage spikes). (The terms [...] "ground" [...] and [...] "earth" [...] are used synonymously here. [...] "Ground" [...] {{is more common in}} North American English, and [...] "earth" [...] is more common in British English.) Under normal conditions, a grounding conductor does not carry current. Grounding is an integral path for home wiring also because it causes circuit breakers to trip more quickly (ie, GFI), which is safer. Adding new grounds requires a qualified electrician with information particular to a power company distribution region.|$|R

The magnet and spectrometer are in two separate boxes with the magnet weighing 149 kg and the electronics weighing 22 kg. Pulsar requires a standard <b>mains</b> <b>electrical</b> supply and uses standard 5mm NMR tubes.

5000|$|The {{prospective}} {{short circuit}} current (PSCC) or available fault current or short circuit making current is the highest electric current which can exist in a particular electrical system under short-circuit conditions. It {{is determined by the}} voltage and impedance of the supply system. It is of the order of a few thousand amperes for a standard domestic <b>mains</b> <b>electrical</b> installation, but may be as low as a few milliamperes in a SELV (Safety Extra Low Voltage or, occasionally, Separated Extra Low Voltage) system or as high as hundreds of thousands of amps in large industrial power systems.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mains</b> <b>electrical</b> power {{circuits}} {{are generally}} grounded (earthed), {{so there will}} be a live (hot) wire, a neutral wire, and a ground wire. Low-cost power strips often come with only one MOV mounted between the live and neutral wires. More complete (and desirable) power strips will have three MOVs, connected between each possible pair of wires. Since MOVs degrade somewhat each time they are triggered, power strips using them have a limited, and unpredictable, protective life. Some power strips have [...] "protection status" [...] lights which are designed to turn off if protective MOVs connected to the live wire have failed, but such simple circuits cannot detect all failure modes (such as failure of a MOV connected between neutral and ground).|$|E

A service tunnel under the stadium provides access for emergency vehicles and the visiting team's coach to enter the stadium directly. Once inside the stadium patrons have access to six themed restaurants, two of which have views of the pitch, and there are 70 executive boxes above the second tier of seating in the north, west and east stands.

Anchorage sustained great destruction or damage to many inadequately earthquake engineered houses, buildings, and infrastructure (paved streets, sidewalks, water and sewer <b>mains,</b> <b>electrical</b> systems, and other man-made equipment), particularly in the several landslide zones along Knik Arm. Two hundred miles southwest, some areas near Kodiak were permanently raised by 30 ft. Southeast of Anchorage, areas around the head of Turnagain Arm near Girdwood and Portage dropped as much as 8 ft, requiring reconstruction and fill to raise the Seward Highway above the new high tide mark.|$|E
50|$|In February 1937, they {{produced}} what they claimed {{was the first}} all-electric mobile fish-and-chips saloon. Beneath a serving counter was an oven, which was fitted with two sets of electric elements. One set could be plugged into a <b>mains</b> <b>electrical</b> socket, and was used to bring the oven up to temperature. Once it was hot, the second set were powered from the vehicle's battery, but the amount of current drawn was somewhat lower, as it only had to maintain the temperature. Two months later, they showcased a mobile milk bar, complete with egg-whisking machines, fountains and a refrigerator, again powered from the vehicle battery. A milk tank held 16 to 20 imp gal of milk. Later in the year they held a competition for ideas to improve or develop their products. Prizes of 10, 5 and 3 guineas were offered.|$|E

5000|$|Most current-clamp {{amplifiers}} provide {{little or}} no amplification of the voltage changes recorded from the cell. The [...] "amplifier" [...] is actually an electrometer, {{sometimes referred to as}} a [...] "unity gain amplifier"; its main job is to change the nature of small signals (in the mV range) produced by cells {{so that they can be}} accurately recorded by low-impedance electronics. The amplifier increases the current behind the signal while decreasing the resistance over which that current passes. Consider this example based on Ohm's law: A voltage of 10 mV is generated by passing 10 nanoamperes of current across 1 MΩ of resistance. The electrometer changes this [...] "high impedance signal" [...] to a [...] "low impedance signal" [...] by using a voltage follower circuit. A voltage follower reads the voltage on the input (caused by a small current through a big resistor). It then instructs a parallel circuit that has a large current source behind it (the <b>electrical</b> <b>mains)</b> and adjusts the resistance of that parallel circuit to give the same output voltage, but across a lower resistance.|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{estimating}} the amplitude, frequency, and phase {{of an unknown}} sinusoidal signal from a noisy-biased measurement is addressed in this paper by a family of parallel prefiltering schemes. The proposed methodology consists in using a pair of linear filters of specified order to generate a suitable number of auxiliary signals {{that are used to}} estimate—in an adaptive way—the frequency, the amplitude, and the phase of the sinusoid. Increasing the order of the prefilters improves the noise immunity of the estimator, at the cost of an increase of the computational complexity. Among the whole family of estimators realizable by varying the order of the filters, the simple parallel prefilters of orders 2 C 2 and 3 C 3 are discussed in detail, being the most attractive from the implementability point of view. The behavior of the two algorithms with respect to bounded external disturbances is characterized by input-to-state stability arguments. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed technique is shown both by comparative numerical simulations and by a real experiment addressing the estimation of the frequency of the <b>electrical</b> <b>mains</b> from a noisy voltage measurement...|$|R
40|$|The weak {{electric}} organ discharges (EODs) of gymnotiform knife fishes {{can be readily}} amplified with a wideband amplifier connected to submerged electrodes.

Here we provide design notes and instructions for the construction and calibration of a cheap, portable, battery-powered, AC-coupled wideband bio-amplifier. This device was designed to allow electric fishes to {{be located in the}} field, and also to permit the relatively noise-free acquisition of EOD waveforms from specimens held in temporary captivity.

40|$|<b>Mains</b> <b>electrical</b> {{lines in}} {{buildings}} and houses contain {{a wealth of}} information about devices that can potentially be exploited through research. However, accessing information through the circuit breaker can be quite difficult due to dangerous high voltages and lack of infrastructure for data logging. The Power Capture Board (PowCap) system was created to solve this problem of end-to-end access. It stores high quality analog signals from a circuit breaker to an open centralized database. It is composed of a customized high power tolerant analog front-end block connected to a digitizer that is an Ettus Research software defined radio board (USRP). The USRP has the ability to collect high-resolution analog voltages with a 24 -bit ADC and generates 1 Terabyte of high-resolution data a day. These rich datasets are downloadable through the web and can now be generated on a daily basis to provide signal processing opportunities that did not exist before...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Trauma/retrieval {{patients}} {{are often in}} shock and hypothermic. Treatment of such patients usually involves restoring their blood volume with transfusion of blood (stored at 2 °C – 6 °C) and/or crystalloids or colloids (stored at ambient temperature). Rapid infusion of these cold fluids can worsen or even induce hypothermia in these patients. Warming of intravenous fluids at accident sites has traditionally been difficult {{due to a lack}} of suitable portable fluid warmers that are not dependent on <b>mains</b> <b>electrical</b> or battery power. If latent heat, the heat released when a liquid solidifies (an inherently temperature limiting process) can warm intravenous fluids, portable devices without a reliance on electrical energy could be used to reduce the incidence of hypothermia in trauma patients. Methods Rapid infusion of red cells into patients was timed to sample typical clinical flow rates. An approved dry heat blood warmer was compared with a prototype blood warmer using a supercooled liquid latent heat storage material, to warm red cells whilst monitoring inlet and outlet temperatures. To determine the effect of warming on red cell integrity compared to the normal storage lesion of blood, extracellular concentrations of potassium, lactate dehydrogenase and haemoglobin were measured in blood which had been warmed after storage at 2 °C – 6 °C for 1 to 42 days. Results A prototype latent heat fluid warmer consistently warmed red cells from approximately 4 °C to approximately 35 °C at typical clinical flow rates. Warming of stored blood with latent heat did not affect red cell integrity more than the approved dry heat blood warmer. Conclusion Using latent heat as an energy source can satisfactorily warm cold blood or other intravenous fluids to near body temperature, without any adverse affects. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{possible}} effects of occupational levels of 50 Hz magnetic fields (MF) on human performance it is preferable to monitor performance during rather than subsequent to MF exposure. We previously reported studies of heart rate and cognitive behaviour where the issue of contamination was not a serious one. Our present study involves electrophysiological measures, which have a greater capacity to identify the effects and assist in localising them. The contamination of EEG signal by the MF exposure is clearly a problem {{in this type of}} study. Previous investigators have not reported these types of measurement concurrent with MF exposure due to the contamination difficulty; but this paper reports means of accomplishing this. Overall a combination of 12 methods for reducing pickup were employed. These were: 1) Distancing recording instruments from the MF source; 2) Shielding the devices and wiring; 3) Appropriate choice of cables; 4) Grounding the instrumentation; 5) Orientation of conduits; 6) Isolation of <b>electrical</b> <b>mains</b> power supplies; 7) Balancing the input impedances; 8) Applying a driven shield technique; 9) Improved electronics design incorporating pre-amplification and circuit impedance level control; 10) Analogue filtering; 11) Signal Averaging; and 12) Post acquisition digital filtering using frequency and time domain techniques...|$|R
50|$|In the 19th and 20th century, Quinten did {{not change}} much, as the absence of road {{connections}} made industrialization and commerce very difficult. One major change was {{the construction of the}} walking track that connects Quinten and Au in the early 20th century which made the life of the children of Au much easier, as they no longer had to climb steeply up and then down into Quinten, but could use the lovely and flat new track on their way to school. In the early 1930s it looked like Quinten's fate was about to change, when the construction of a road from Weesen at the western end to Walenstadt at the eastern end of the Walensee was discussed. Two projects were discussed, one along the northern side of the lake through Quinten, the other along the southern side. In the end the road was built on the southern side and Quinten was left to stay the quiet place it still is. In the 1950s <b>electrical</b> <b>mains</b> power reached Quinten which led to the arrival of weekenders who built their houses in Quinten starting around the same time. In 1960 the excursion boat service took up its operation. The village school ceased to exist in 1972.|$|R
40|$|Some {{parameters}} of the <b>electrical</b> <b>mains</b> must be compensated to obtain high quality levels and good efficiency on the electrical energy distribution, namely the current or voltage harmonics, current or voltage asymmetries and the positive fundamental reactive power.

Several functions can be realized as the: mains current harmonics compensation - active power filter; mains asymmetric currents compensation; positive fundamental reactive power compensation; and as a bi-directional A C/D C power converter with independent reactive power control. In this work the system models are presented and its study and simulation is realized. A general control circuit in Park's coordinates and the system controllers that leads to the realization of the several applications referred at the same time are presented.
