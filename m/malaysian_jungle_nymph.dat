Results showed that breast cancers in the TH-treated groups had slower size increment and smaller mean tumor size (≤ 2 cm 3) compared to Controls (≤ 8 cm 3). The number of cancers developing in TH-treated groups was also significantly fewer (P 0. 05).

40|$|Tualang honey (TH) is a <b>Malaysian</b> <b>jungle</b> honey {{obtained}} from the wild. The honey is produced by the rock bee (Apis dorsata), which builds hives on branches of tall Tualang (Koompassia excelsa (Becc.) Taub) trees located mainly in the north-western region of Peninsular Malaysia. Limited information {{is available on the}} antibacterial mechanism of local honey. The present study was conducted to determine the antibacterial activity of diluted ?Tualang? honey against Escherichia coli (E. coli). Three different Tualang honey concentrations, namely, 20, 30 and 40 % were used to examine the effect of diluting Tualang honey on its antibacterial effect towards E. coli. The 40 % diluted honey was the most effective in inhibiting the growth of E. coli, followed by honey diluted at 20 and 30 %. The high antibacterial activity of honey towards E. Coli was thought to arise from the production of hydrogen peroxide, but requires further study to validate the action...|$|R
50|$|Immediately {{after the}} fall of Malaya and Singapore in 1942, a few British officers, such as the legendary Freddie Spencer Chapman, eluded capture and escaped into the central <b>Malaysian</b> <b>jungle</b> where they helped {{organize}} and train bands of lightly armed local ethnic Chinese communists into a capable guerrilla force against the Japanese occupiers. What began as desperate initiatives by several determined British officers probably inspired the subsequent formation of the above-mentioned early jungle-warfare forces.The real pioneers who methodically developed it as a specialized branch of warfare - the unconventional, low-intensity, guerrilla-style type of warfare as it is understood today - were probably the British and Australians. V Force and Force 136 were composed of small bodies of soldiers and irregulars, equipped with no more than small arms and explosives, but rigorously trained in guerrilla warfare-style tactics (particularly in close-quarter combat) who fought behind enemy lines. They were joined in Burma by American led Kachin guerrillas were armed and coordinated by the American liaison organisation, OSS Detachment 101 that led, armed, and coordinated them.|$|R

30|$|Rubberwood (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg.) is {{presently}} widely planted in Malaysia (over 1.5  million ha) to produce rubber (as an industrial raw material) {{and increase the}} supply of timber so as to decrease the exploitation of <b>Malaysian</b> natural <b>jungles</b> [1 – 3]. Some 80  % of the Malaysian furniture content is derived from rubberwood products either {{in the form of}} solid timber or reconstituted panel products [4]. To establish plantations of rubberwood species, we need to know the wood properties among the tree varieties. Especially, in tropical fast-grown plantations, attention is focused on the association between radial growth rates and wood quality of xylem yield [2]. The wood properties analyzed transversely across the radial direction, around the bark, or from stem base upwards [2, 5] and this variability has a significant influence on the final use of the wood [6, 7]. A comprehensive understanding of the sources of variation in the structural characteristics of the wood due to effects of plantation management practices is necessary. One approach toward this understanding is to study the variation in wood structure due to different stocking densities. Dodd [8] observed variation in wood structure within the tree in relation to the crown in sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus). To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is no specific study on the effect of different stocking densities on the radial variation in rubberwood structure. Lim and Fujiwara [9] had investigated variation in wood density in two clones of rubberwood at three different planting densities. The radial variation in wood anatomical characteristics may have an important effect on the quality in terms of processing and product manufacture [10]. To realize the optimum utilization of these timber species, a detailed study of the radial variation of wood features is required. Muhammed and Sahri [11] and Norul Izani and Sahri [12] had reported an increasing trend for fiber and vessel cell anatomical properties from pith outwards in different clones of rubberwood. The present study investigates on sizes and amounts of variation in the radial direction for fibers, vessels, and ray cells of rubberwood trees planted at four different densities.|$|R
