40|$|Objective To {{examine the}} {{prediction}} {{validity of the}} Military <b>Mental</b> <b>Disorder</b> Prediction Scale on the <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> of new recruits. Methods The present study surveyed 64356 new recruits from 2007 to 2009 with the Military <b>Mental</b> <b>Disorder</b> Prediction Scale. High-risk recruits predicted as positive by the Military <b>Mental</b> <b>Disorder</b> Prediction Scale were screened out and kept track of to observe the prediction validity on the general incidence rate of <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> in the army environment and the incidence rate at different periods(1 month to 6 months, 7 months to 12 months,and more than 12 months). The present study designated new recruits with initial onset of <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> within three years as the <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> group and compared them with the contrast group of healthy new recruits at the same period to examine the sensitivity and specificity of the prediction by the <b>Mental</b> <b>Disorder</b> Prediction Scale. Then,the study adopted Chi-square test to analyze the relationship between six factors(family medical history,past medical history,growth experience,introversion,stressor,poor metal defense,and social support) and the prediction of the <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> of new recruits. Results Up to 421 cases are predicted by the scale as positive among 64356 new recruits,among whom 156 have <b>mental</b> <b>disorder.</b> As predicted by the scale,the general incidence rate of recruits is 37. 1 %,and the incidence rate is 24. 0 % within 1 month to 6 months, 9. 7 % within 7 months to 12 months,and 3. 6 % after 12 months. The prediction sensitivity of <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> is 95. 71 %,and the specificity is 87. 73 %. The Chi-square test shows that family medical history and past medical history(OR= 3. 17,P < 0. 05),introversion(OR= 4. 42,P < 0. 05),and poor mental defense(OR= 2. 91,P < 0. 05) are contributive factors to the <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> of new recruits. Conclusions The Military <b>Mental</b> <b>Disorder</b> Prediction Scale has better prediction validity for the <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> of new recruits. Family medical record,past medical record,introversion,and poor mental defense are contributive factors to the <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> of new recruits,which shall be given attention during the <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> screening of new recruits...|$|R

A number of textbooks written in English, German, French, Spanish, and Italian, selected as examples, have been scanned so as {{to see if there is}} a chapter dealing with <b>mental</b> <b>disorder,</b> in particular with its definition. Also, the fields in which the <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> plays a major role have been identified, and the reasons why the concept of <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> is relevant for them have been explored. There is no chapter dealing with the definition of <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> in some textbooks of psychiatry in English, German, French, Spanish, and Italian that have been selected as examples. Yet there are numerous domains, directly or indirectly related to psychiatry, in which the <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> concept is a substantial element.

40|$|Aim The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} the association between <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> and risk of sexual HIV transmission in a low-income country with a generalized HIV epidemic. Specific objectives were to investigate in Uganda, (1) the association between common <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> and sexual risk behaviour, (2) how severe <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> could influence sexual risk behaviour, (3) the prevalence of HIV in persons with severe <b>mental</b> <b>disorder,</b> and (4) the association of severe <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> with sexual risk behaviour and sexual violence exposure. Methods (1) Population-based household survey of 646 Ugandans. Depression, psychological distress and alcohol use were assessed, and questions asked about sexual risk behaviour. (2) Facility-based qualitative semi-structured interview study of 20 Ugandans, exploring sexual risk behaviour and violence exposure. (3) Facility-based study of HIV prevalence among 602 persons with severe <b>mental</b> <b>disorder.</b> (4) Facility-based study of prevalence of sexual risk behaviour and sexual violence among 602 persons with severe <b>mental</b> <b>disorder,</b> with nationally representative comparison data. Results (1) Depression, psychological distress and alcohol use were all associated with sexual risk behaviour, with stronger associations found in women than in men. (2) Severe <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> can influence sexual risks by contributing to casual sex during episodes, to rape by non-partners, to exploitation by partners, to non-monogamy in partners, and to sexual inactivity. (3) HIV prevalence was higher in women with severe <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> than in women in the general population, but no similar difference was found in men. (4) Severe <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> was associated with sexual risk behaviour in women, but not men. In women, severe <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> was associated with exposure to sexual violence by a non-partner. The above associations were not confounded by basic socio-demographic variables. Conclusions <b>Mental</b> <b>disorder</b> is associated with risk of sexual HIV transmission in a low-income country with a generalized HIV epidemic. Associations were found across levels of <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> severity and in relationship to several indicators of sexual risk. Stronger associations were found in women. By design {{we were not able to}} show that <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> preceded the development of sexual risk behaviour, or first sexual violence exposure. However, qualitative and quantitative findings were consistent. Our findings suggest that women with <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> in Uganda may be at higher risk of HIV, and at higher risk of sexual violence, than women in the general population...|$|R
40|$|A {{psychological}} {{model of}} <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> A coherent conceptualisation {{of the role}} of psychological factors is of great importance in understanding <b>mental</b> <b>disorder.</b> Academic papers and professional reports alluding to psychological models of the aetiology of <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> are becoming increasingly common, and there is evidence of a marked policy shift towards the provision of psychological therapies and interventions. This paper discusses the relationship between biological, social and psychological factors in the causation and treatment of <b>mental</b> <b>disorder.</b> It argues that simple biological reductionism is not scientifically justified, and also that the specific role of psychological processes within the biopsychosocial model requires further elaboration. The biopsychosocial model is usually interpreted as implying that biological, social and psychological factors are co-equal partners in the aetiology of <b>mental</b> <b>disorder.</b> The psychological model of <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> presented here suggests that disruption or dysfunction in psychological processes is a final common pathway in the development of <b>mental</b> <b>disorder.</b> These processes include, but are not limited to, cognitive processes. The model proposes that biological and environmental factors, together with a person‟s personal experiences, lead to <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> through their conjoint effects on these psychological processes.

40|$|Abstract Background Researchers {{generally}} {{agree that}} <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> represents {{a burden to}} the family. The present study concerns the subjective burden of living with a person with <b>mental</b> <b>disorder,</b> more specifically the association between <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> in the index person and subjective well-being and symptoms of anxiety and depression in the spouse. Methods Data were obtained from questionnaires administered to the adult population of Nord-Trøndelag County, Norway during the period 1995 - 1997. The present study {{is based on a}} subsample where 9, 740 couples were identified. Subjective burden in spouses of persons with <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> was compared with subjective burden in spouses of persons without <b>mental</b> <b>disorder,</b> using analysis of variance (ANOVA). All analyses were stratified by sex. Results Adjusting for several covariates, spouses of persons with <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> scored significantly lower on subjective well-being and significantly higher on symptoms of anxiety and depression compared to spouses of index persons without <b>mental</b> <b>disorder.</b> Although highly significant, the effect sizes were moderate, corresponding to a difference in standard deviations ranging from. 34 -. 51. Conclusions Our study supports the notion that there is an association between <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> in one partner and subjective burden in the spouse, but not to the same extent that have been reported in earlier studies, as our results do not indicate that {{a large proportion of the}} spouses reach a symptom level of anxiety and depression that reflects clinical <b>mental</b> <b>disorder.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|How can we {{understand}} the troubling under-inclusiveness of our law of <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> – its failure to recognize mental conditions that, on the most compelling theoretical accounts of how <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> operates on criminal responsibility, ought to concern us deeply? This article argues that the gap between our plausible theories of criminal responsibility and our practices relating to <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> is best understood as a marker for the criminal law’s central social function: the laundering and containment of blame. The article begins by canvassing the conceptual structure of the defence of <b>mental</b> <b>disorder,</b> turning then to the troubling prevalence of <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> among those facing criminal judgment, looking specifically at the incidence and effects of FASD, autism spectrum disorder, and anti-social personality disorder. These conditions operate on key elements of our theoretical account of criminal responsibility but are excluded from our defence of <b>mental</b> <b>disorder.</b> Yet giving serious doctrinal regard to facts about <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> {{that ought to be}} of theoretical concern would destabilize individual responsibility for crime, showing itself as a far more complex social and political matter than we like to admit and raising questions about our collective standing to blame. The article argues that this analysis gives a line of sight into the symbolic and communicative role of the law of <b>mental</b> <b>disorder,</b> and the criminal law more generally – it is a mechanism for the concealment of collective responsibility for complex social problems...|$|R
40|$|Medicalisation is the {{misclassification}} of non-medical {{problems as}} medical problems. A {{common form of}} medicalisation is the misclassification of normal distress as a <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> (usually a mood disorder).

Nine-hundred HIV positive people were interviewed in 18 recruitment sites across five provinces in South Africa, using a cross-culturally validated diagnostic instrument and a structured socio-demographic and health information questionnaire. Prevalence of <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> was established using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Chi-square, Fischer exact test, and binary logistic regression examined the relationship between <b>mental</b> health <b>disorders</b> and demographic characteristics, disease stage, CD 4 count, and whether the person was on anti-retroviral treatment. A number of respondents (43. 7 %) were found to have a diagnosable <b>mental</b> <b>disorder.</b> Depression was the most common disorder (11. 1 % major and 29. 9 % mild depression), followed by alcohol abuse disorder (12. 4 %). The presence of <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> was significantly associated with gender, employment status, having children, and the clinical stage of the disease.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{establish}} {{the prevalence of}} victimisation in a UK population-based sample and to investigate the association between <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> and victimisation in both cross-sectional and prospective manner, whilst adjusting for potential confounds. METHODS: Data from the National Child Development Study (NCDS) were used to examine criminal victimisation, violent victimisation, and <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> at age 46 yerars, and also to measure history of <b>mental</b> <b>disorder,</b> when cohort members were aged 23, 33 and 42 years. Variables considered to be potential confounders or mediators of the association, including socio-economic status, family income, financial strain, education, housing ownership status, heavy drinking and gender, all measured at age 46 years, were considered in multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The prevalence of criminal victimisation amongst cohort members in the 12 months preceding interview was 15 %; 2. 2 % of the participants reported experiencing violent victimisation in the past year. <b>Mental</b> <b>disorder</b> at age 46 {{was significantly associated with}} criminal and violent victimisation, even after adjusting for potential confounds. A prior history of <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> was found to be a robust predictor of criminal and violent victimisation. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that those with a <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> are at elevated risk of victimisation, including violent victimisation. That such an association might reflect an underlying causal relationship is further supported by the confirmation that the association holds true when <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> is measured well before the assessment of victimisation risk, and that it persists despite adjustment for a number of potential confounding factors...|$|R
