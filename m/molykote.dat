50|$|PTFE joint clips are {{sometimes}} used, as its recommended temperature peak matches {{that of most}} practical chemistry work. Its highly inert nature also makes it immune to degradation around the corrosive gases. However, it is both expensive and will begin producing hydrogen fluoride if heated to beyond its specified temperature; so {{care must be taken}} to avoid this, given the level of risk the result presents. The same is true of using Krytox and chemically resistant <b>Molykote</b> (PTFE thickened, fluoro-based) oils and greases for glassware seals.|$|E
50|$|PTFE joint clips are {{sometimes}} used, as its recommended temperature peak matches {{that of most}} practical chemistry work. Its highly inert nature also makes it immune to degradation around the corrosive gases. However, it is both expensive and will begin producing perfluoroisobutylene if heated to beyond its specified temperature; so {{care must be taken}} to avoid this, given the level of risk the result presents. The same is true of using Krytox and chemically resistant <b>Molykote</b> (PTFE thickened, fluoro based) oils and greases for glassware seals. High grade stainless steel joint clip is a final option. Naturally, this can withstand the entire temperature spectrum of borosilicate glass and is reasonably inert. Though, lower grades of stainless are still rapidly attacked {{in the presence of the}} corrosive gases and the clips themselves are often as expensive as PTFE.|$|E
40|$|Eight commercially {{available}} thread lubricants were evaluated {{to determine the}} best replacement for Red Lead and Graphite in Mineral Oil (RLGMO). The evaluation included coefficient of friction testing, high temperature anti-seizing testing, room temperature anti-galling testing, chemical analysis for detrimental impurities, corrosion testing, off-gas testing, and a review of health and environmental factors. The coefficient of friction testing covered a wide variety of factors including stud, nut, and washer materials, sizes, manufacturing methods, surface coatings, surface finishes, applied loads, run-in cycles, and relubrication. Only one lubricant, Dow Corning <b>Molykote</b> P 37, met all the criteria established for a replacement lubricant. It has a coefficient of friction range similar to RLGMO. Therefore, it can be substituted directly for RLGMO without changing the currently specified fastener torque values for the sizes, materials and conditions evaluated. Other lubricants did not perform as well as <b>Molykote</b> P 37 in one or more test or evaluation categories...|$|E
