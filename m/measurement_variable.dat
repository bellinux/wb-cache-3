40|$|Abstract. Determining {{complexity}} {{has become}} a main focus for man-aging projects. Complexity measures base their statements about a sys-tem’s complexity on measurement variables (key figures). But fast changes in technology in computer science require complexity measures to be adaptable to changing underlying systems, which should be evaluated. Furthermore, most measurements are based on empirical data which makes projects hard to compare. This work will discuss whether states {{could be used as}} a <b>measurement</b> <b>variable</b> for complexity. Complexity can be considered to be a measure of a system’s disorder which is a property of a system’s state. Complexity varies with changes made at the amount of possible states of a system. Working with states for measuring complexity has been applied on dig-ital hardware design within the design entropy concept. This work will show that states and the design entropy model can also be used to get complexity in other fields under control...|$|E

Accurate recovery of parameters depends on {{the quality and quantity of}} measurement data.

In this paper a method was proposed to determine the most informative measurement set for parameter estimation of dynamic systems, in particular biochemical reaction systems, such that the unknown parameters can be inferred with the best possible statistical quality using the data collected from the designed experiments. System analysis using matrix theory was used to examine the number of necessary measurement variables.

This psychometric property allows an estimation of the true-score structure of the cross-sectional <b>measurement</b> <b>variables</b> in a longitudinal SEM model, including method effects.

To monitor subjective and potentially transient phenomena like pain and mood in patients, sensitive and easily administered assessment techniques are required, especially when pa-tients are requested to rate themselves repeatedly. The well-known visual analogue scale (VAS), also called the graphic rating scale (Freyd, 1923), is appealing for this reason. "A VAS is a straight line, the end anchors of which are labeled as the extreme boundaries of the sensation, feeling, or response to be measured " (Wewers & Lowe, 1990, p. 227).

This assessment shall be used to identify the current state of financing methods and quality of the healthcare sector in countries of Western Balkans. Specifically, by identifying the differences in financing healthcare sector among Western Balkan countries, this research paper measures the effect of financial means on the performance variables, as well as the relationship between the performance variables and the quality <b>measurement</b> <b>variable</b> i. e. life expectancy. These measurements were done using regression analysis through the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) methodology. The number of physicians and the number of nurses are considered as performance measurement variables due to their crucial role in the performance of the healthcare sector as it was previously determined in other research studies. According to regression analysis, the effect of financial means that a country dedicates to healthcare sector resulted to be statistically significant over the number of physicians operating in healthcare. On the other hand, according to the results that can be drawn by the regression model, the impact of financial means on the number of nurses resulted to be statistically insignificant. Regression analysis was also used in determining the impact of performance variables on life expectancy, used as a quality <b>measurement</b> <b>variable.</b> The model which tested for the relationship between the number of physicians and the number of nurses shows that at a 10 % level of significance, both variables resulted to be statistically significant, showing that these variables are important in measuring the quality of healthcare. But at a 95 % level of confidence the model shows that only the number of physicians is significant, whereas the number of nurses turns to be insignificant. Therefore, it can be said that the number of physicians is a crucial factor in determining the quality of healthcare in a specific country. Furthermore, the effect of healthcare infrastructure, specifically, the effect of bed ratio is also measured over the quality of the healthcare sector of a country. Considering that at a 95 % level of confidence, the bed ratio variable resulted to be statistically significant, it can be concluded that more attention needs to be paid at the bed ratio variable as it plays an important role in determining the healthcare quality of a country...|$|E

In this study, an analysis of quantifiable measurements that affect drivers’ perception of visual complexity and visual search performance was conducted.
