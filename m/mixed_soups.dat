40|$|Moisture {{sorption}} isotherms of rice-based instant <b>soup</b> <b>mix</b> {{at temperature}} range 15 – 45 °C and relative humidity from 0. 11 to 0. 86 were determined using the standard gravimetric static method.

40|$|The {{objective}} of {{investigation was to}} formulate low sodium <b>soup</b> <b>mixes</b> based on vegetables and evaluate their acceptability. Four different <b>soup</b> <b>mixes</b> (tomato, onion, onion + tomato and mix vegetable) were prepared. In each soup five different variations varying in levels of salt and with or without added monosodium glutamate (MSG) were prepared. One of soup with normal salt level of 1 % (based on preference) served as control (I). Other samples were prepared with 0. 7 % salt (II), 0. 7 % salt with 40 mg MSG (III), 0. 5 % salt (IV) and 0. 5 % salt with 80 mg MSG (V). Samples were presented to panel members with a score card for determining acceptability. Results revealed that in all products, 0. 7 % salt with MSG was accepted well and in both soup II and IV, taste and acceptability improved after addition of MSG. Addition of MSG improved flavour profile of soups and assisted in salt reduction. Hence, MSG {{can be used to}} lower the sodium content of processed products due to its flavour potentiating effect...|$|R
