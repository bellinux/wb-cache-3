30|$|From the Tampere Summit held in 1999, the {{government}} {{heads of the}} EU {{recognized the importance of}} cooperating through partnerships with third countries in order to achieve their migration control objectives (Tampere European Council, Presidency Conclusions, 1999). Migration control objectives increasingly became intertwined to the larger framework of cooperation with the EU and appeared in economic agreements {{as well as in the}} field of development aid. Developing migrants’ countries of origin is increasingly understood as providing an alternative to emigration and the European Commission has since 1994 pushed for enhanced synergies between migration and development with the aim to reduce <b>migratory</b> <b>pressures</b> (European Commission, 2002, p. 7). The global discourse on migration within the sphere of the European Union is gradually changing, acknowledging the failures of previous restrictive policies. As stated by the European Commission in a communication from 2000 : “it is clear from an analysis of the economic and demographic context of the Union and of countries of origin, that there is a growing recognition that the “zero” immigration policies of the past 30  years are no longer appropriate (…). In this situation, a choice must be made between maintaining the view that the Union can continue to resist <b>migratory</b> <b>pressures</b> and accepting that immigration will continue and should be properly regulated and working together to try to maximise its positive effects on the Union, for the migrants themselves and for the countries of origin” (European Commission, 2000, p. 3).|$|R
40|$|First {{published}} online: 05 September 2017 This article {{shows how}} understandings amongst policy élites of a 'new normal' {{form the basis}} for current and future EU action on migration in the Mediterranean region. This new normality centres on the understanding that Europe faces significant <b>migratory</b> <b>pressures</b> at its Mediterranean borders. By opening the 'black box' of European and EU migration governance, the article seeks to provide fresh insight into how framing and frame enactment shape policy responses. Rather than detailing the 'outputs' or 'outcomes' of European migration governance systems – such as laws and policy approaches – this paper adopts a different approach by exploring the underlying perceptions and understandings of migration held by actors within migration governance systems...|$|R

Between 2000 and 2005 the <b>migratory</b> <b>pressure</b> in Morocco has increased and reached its highest point in summer-autumn 2005, when hundreds of migrants assaulted the barriers of the two Spanish enclaves (Ceuta and Melilla), causing the death of dozens of people and the injure of hundreds of people.|$|E
40|$|For those Mexicans that {{choose to}} do so, {{migration}} to the U. S. can be both incredibly costly and risky. But with annual wages {{less than a third}} the cost of migration, how are migrants able to afford to do so? Jeronimo Cortina looks at the role of Mexico’s Procampo agricultural assistance program, finding that its cash transfers are inadvertently encouraging many Mexicans to emigrate to the U. S. He argues that for the subsidy to achieve its purpose, then it must be conditional, or that instead, the Mexican government should create a regional structural fund aimed at rural counties in which migration is not yet prevalent to provide incentives to transform idle arable land into a productive investment, thus minimizing <b>migratory</b> <b>pressures...</b>|$|R

40|$|EU and EMU {{are facing}} a hastened phase of {{structural}} rather than episodic crisis, following the progressive shift of the world order from a bipolar toward a multi-polar system. From the sovereign debt trap to <b>migratory</b> <b>pressures</b> and security threats, all European crisis are intimately interdependent and long awaited rather than unexpected, since their origins trace back {{to a lack of}} reactivity of the European unification process to the progressive weakening of US hegemony in the world from 1971 onward. In this paper I point out that two double-binds mutually prevent a full (and widespread) understanding of Europe’s situation and avoid for this reason a fully structural approach to the institutional reforming process in the EU: a ‘sovereignty double-bind’ and a ‘democracy double-bind’. An effective roadmap toward political unification should primarily aim at tackling these misrepresentations instead of embracing them {{in the form of a}} gradualist approach to legitimacy issues...|$|R
50|$|The new {{restraining}} {{measures on}} the Mediterranean coasts, following up the agreements between Italy and Spain, are gradually moving the <b>migratory</b> <b>pressure</b> on the maritime route between El Aaiún inWestern Sahara and the Canary Islands. This trail lasts almost a night. As time goes by, the fishermen' ships (dugout or pateras) of the Western Sahara, {{which have been}} strengthened with more powerful engines and therefore {{are more and more}} crowded with irregular migrants, are forced to start their journey from coastal spots more and more far-away from El Aaiún route. On the other hand, the restrictions adopted on the Mauritanian and Moroccan coasts deter fishermen from attempting this long journey and the starting points are no longer the Western- Saharan ones, but they become southward oriented, including the coasts of Senegal, Gambia and Gulf of Guinea.|$|E
50|$|While the European policies,which have {{submitted}} the migration {{check to the}} coastal local authorities, seem {{to be effective in}} restraining the maritime migratory stream coming from Maghreb (though indirectly increasing human rights abuses), in 2007 trans-saharan and maritime routes from Africa have spread all over both modifying primal origins and increasing distances, human and material loss of the Great Migration. New routes have developed directly from Sub-Saharan countries (Senegal, Gambia, Guinea coast) creating new entry paths and new migratory strategies (i.e. the increasing number of underages because less exposed to the risk of forced homecoming), which have partially varied the migrants' origins (fewer migrants from Sub-Sahara and more from Egypt and Morocco) but still not reducing the <b>migratory</b> <b>pressure</b> from Libya, which is still the major source of people migrating towards Italy and the main spot of departure for the European dream.|$|E

40|$|The fail of {{communist}} ideology {{and the subsequent}} breaking up of the old empire has allowed an acceleration {{of the process of}} world wide exchange liberalization.

30|$|Even though {{restrictive}} {{policies of}} migration control remain {{dominant in the}} external dimension of the European migration policy, those new principles emerged, guiding its evolution: migration can and must be managed to profit the EU, the countries of origin and the migrants themselves, cooperation with third countries is essential to reduce <b>migratory</b> <b>pressures</b> and development in the migrants’ countries of origin can provide an alternative to migration. The following cooperation frameworks proposed by the EU reflect this new posture and impose these principles as self-evidence. With the objective to develop closer relations with its neighbours following the 2004 enlargement, the EU launched the European Neighbourhood Policy (European Commission, 2003), which further contributed to {{the transfer of the}} European “best practices” in the field of migration management. Paradoxically, the evolution of the cooperation between the EU and third countries in the field of migration also seems to indicate the increasing role attributed to third countries in the formation and consolidation of the internal security strategy of the Union (Gabrielli, 2007; Guiraudon, 2010).|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis clarifies {{the issue}} of Triadic nexus among Slovakia, Hungary and the Hungarian {{minority}} concerning education and economic access to areas inhabited by the Hungarian minority, which affect the graduates of minority schools in the Slovak labor market.

The main focus is on the trilateral approach to {{the issue of}} education in the Slovak minority schools in Hungarian language in case of teaching the state language. The consequences of the different trilateral relation approach to minority education can lead to inefficiency of minority schools teaching Slovak language, which can, in conjunction with the current economic approach of Slovakia to the areas inhabited by the Hungarian minority, lead to <b>migratory</b> <b>pressures</b> on graduates of minority schools as for the choice of university studies and their employability.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on {{government}} anti-trafficking policies and funding allocations in two case-study countries, Ukraine and the United Kingdom (UK). The paper discusses specific ways, or ‘vectors’, in which human trafficking has been discursively constructed by national policies and the solutions that have been offered to counteract it. It relies on publicly available information and information obtained via Freedom of Information requests from public authorities in these countries to explore the extent to which anti-trafficking funding allocated by national governments supports or unsettles such representations. A broader definition of human trafficking has been encoded into anti-trafficking policies in Ukraine, implicating <b>migratory</b> <b>pressures</b> and violation of irregular migrants’ human rights as the root causes of trafficking. However, the ability of the government to act upon this definition is limited by the ongoing socio-economic and political crises in Ukraine. This is in comparison to the politicised construction of trafficking by the UK government as a threat from international organised crime and ‘illegal’ immigration. The paper concludes that governments in both countries put their anti-trafficking money where ‘their mouths are’: crime, immigration and victim care in the UK, and awareness raising, victim care and training of ‘frontline professionals’ in Ukrain...|$|R

Its main aim was to take due account of the interests and objectives of EU, partner countries and migrants themselves. So, the partnership was included among the external migration policy’s instruments with additional and different features than its earlier namesakes of the Union’s external relations. Nevertheless, the need to contain the <b>migratory</b> <b>pressure</b> coming from Africa and the Mediterranean, an area in which the Union has recognized priority actions, affects the form and the content of the few partnerships concluded until now and has a negative impact on its results, {{as well as on the}} respect of fundamental rights of migrants...|$|E
40|$|At {{the dawn}} of the 21 st century, {{migration}} has emerged as a central issue in the international economic and political scene and as a crucial factor of societal change for many countries. Globalization and capitalist restructuring have not only altered the patterns of international migration (geographic, economic, political, cultural), but they are also themselves affected by the new multidimensional migration trends: migration is now a global phenomenon, one of the visible faces of globalization and one of its major driving forces. In Europe, given its long-standing history of population movements, migration has become a central issue in the political and economic agenda. On the one hand, the consolidation of new minorities challenges the concept and content of citizenship and therefore the nature of the welfare state itself, while concerns are raised about the worsening problems of racism and social exclusion. On the other hand, contemporary migration dynamics affect the process of European integration in various ways, for instance with respect to East–West mobility patterns and the new enlargement of the European Union (EU), or the increasing irregular <b>migratory</b> <b>pressures</b> and the building of the European ‘Fortress’. Within this context, the southern member states of the EU have been transformed from exporters of labour to new destination countries, as a result of both internal and international developments that have taken place during the past two or three decades. 1 The Greek case has certainly been part of this transformation, currently sharing similar migratio...|$|R
40|$|Ghana has {{achieved}} dramatic improvements in national food security in recent years, but concealed in this overall progress {{is a considerable}} measure of regional unevenness, with the population living in the dry savannah regions in the north faring the worst. The Upper West Region (UWR) is the poorest region of Ghana and has long served as a reservoir of migratory labour for the southern parts of the country, {{but in recent years}} migration patterns have been both escalating and changing. Increasingly, permanent UWR migration is focusing on the more fertile lands of the Brong-Ahafo Region (BAR), where migrants are able to access farmland in different leasehold relationships. A rapid research appraisal conducted in Techiman (BAR) suggests that UWR migrants view their growing settlement in the BAR to be a long-term phenomenon. It also highlighted how land tenancy issues are central to the challenges migrant farmers face, and are largely perceived as being immutable by the farmers themselves. Nearly all new UWR migrants must begin working in sharecropping relationships for BA landlords, paying out one-third of their harvest as rent, and over time they hope to save sufficient market earnings in order to lease the land outright. Despite these rents and the high cost of transportation, this chapter suggests that evolving migration patterns from the Upper West Region (UWR) of Ghana are connected to an intensifying system of domestic “food aid” (i. e. non-market transfers) back to the region, providing a crucial means of coping with its precarious food insecurity. With environmental conditions in dry regions of Sahelian Africa projected to worsen with climate change, the agricultural capacity of the UWR is likely to deteriorate further in coming years, with <b>migratory</b> <b>pressures</b> therefore continuing to rise. In light of this, this study points towards both future research objectives in the UWR and the BAR, {{as well as to the}} implications such research could have for policy interventions and locally grounded regional initiatives...|$|R
