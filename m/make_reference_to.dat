5|$|James Graham's {{exploits}} at Waterloo {{became much}} celebrated throughout Great Britain, and many {{accounts of the}} battle <b>make</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> his actions, including a biography of Wellington, the memoirs of another sergeant, and Charles Dickens' magazine Household Words. The shutting of the gate was portrayed by artist Robert Gibb in 1903; the painting is currently held by the National Museums of Scotland. A watercolour portrait of Sergeant Graham himself is held at the National Gallery of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In July 2006, King's College London {{was granted}} degree-awarding powers {{in its own}} right, as opposed to through the University of London, by the Privy Council. This power {{remained}} unexercised until 2007, when King's announced that all students starting courses from September 2007 onwards would be awarded degrees conferred by King's itself, {{rather than by the}} University of London. The new certificates however still <b>make</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> the fact that King's is a constituent college of the University of London. All current students with at least one year of study remaining were in August 2007 offered the option of choosing to be awarded a University of London degree or a King's degree.

5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s however Dessau's {{original}} arguments received powerful restatement {{and expansion}} from Sir Ronald Syme, who devoted three books {{to the subject}} and was prepared to date {{the writing of the}} work closely in the region of AD 395. Other recent studies also show much consistency of style, and most scholars now accept the theory of a single author of unknown identity, writing after 395. Although it was believed that the History Augusta did not reference any material from Ammianus Marcellinus' history, which was finished before 391 and which covered the same period, this has now been shown not to be the case, and that the Historia Augusta does in fact <b>make</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> Ammianus' history.|$|E
5|$|More {{recent studies}} however suggest that Eutharic's Amali ancestry {{may have been}} a {{deliberate}} invention on the part of Theoderic to aid his ambitions of establishing dynastic credibility. According to Gesta Theoderici Eutharic belonged to the Gothic house of Alan rather than the house of Amal. Whilst Jordanes, in his history of the Goths, does <b>make</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> Eutharic's prudentia et virtus, or pride and valour, this too {{may have been a}} fabrication on the part of Theoderic. Those qualities were recognised as requirements of Gothic ethnographic ideology, expressed in their code of civilitas. It would have been highly beneficial for Theoderic's chosen son-in-law to possess them.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, several {{films about}} Anne Frank appeared. Her life and {{writings}} have inspired {{a diverse group}} of artists and social commentators to <b>make</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> her in literature, popular music, television, and other media. These include The Anne Frank Ballet by Adam Darius, first performed in 1959, and the choral work Annelies, first performed in 2005. The only known footage of the real Anne Frank comes from a 1941 silent film recorded for her newlywed next-door neighbour. She is seen leaning out of a second-floor window in an attempt to better view the bride and groom. The couple, who survived the war, gave the film to the Anne Frank House.|$|E

25|$|The fine old {{sandstone}} bridge which {{carried the}} road up to Corsehill was demolished {{in the early}} 1990s.

25|$|The {{composer}} deliberately {{made the}} titles vague, {{so that they}} are not associated with specific tales or voyages of Sinbad. However, in the epigraph to the finale, he does <b>make</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> the adventure of Prince Ajib. In a later edition, he did away with titles altogether, desiring instead that the listener should hear his work only as an Oriental-themed symphonic music that evokes a sense of the fairy-tale adventure.|$|E
25|$|There also survive {{documents}} from Castile which <b>make</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> the imperator terrae ("emperor of the land"), but {{the relevance of}} these was disputed by Mayer and Menéndez Pidal, who disagreed whether they referred to the Count of Castile or the King of León. The charters date from 968, when the count was Fernán González and the king was Ramiro III, and 1042, when the count, Ferdinand I, was also king.|$|E
