5|$|On December 12, 2001, Ryder {{was arrested}} on {{shoplifting}} charges in Beverly Hills, California. She was accused of stealing $5,500 worth of designer clothes and accessories at a Saks Fifth Avenue department store. In the security offices of the store, before Ryder was arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department, she signed two civil demands that bound her {{to pay for the}} stolen and surrendered merchandise, as permitted under California's Statute for Civil Recovery for Shoplifting. Los Angeles District Attorney Stephen Cooley produced a team of eight prosecutors, and filed four felony charges against her. Ryder hired noted celebrity defense attorney <b>Mark</b> <b>Geragos.</b> Negotiations for a plea bargain failed at the end of summer 2002. As noted by Joel Mowbray from National Review, the prosecution was not ready to offer the actress an open door to a no-contest plea on misdemeanor charges.|$|E
25|$|In a press {{appearance}} {{following a}} hearing in September 2016, Cosby's lawyers claimed {{for the first time}} that racial bias was to blame for the sex-assault charges against their client.

25|$|Anderson's attorney, <b>Mark</b> <b>Geragos,</b> said {{he would}} file an appeal based on his {{assertion}} that the subpoena to testify violated Anderson's plea bargain agreement in the BALCO case. Later that month, the grand jury investigating the incident retired without issuing an indictment. Anderson was immediately released and promptly subpoenaed to testify before a new grand jury that would take up the case. Geragos stated that his client would continue to refuse to testify.|$|E

500|$|During a {{sentencing}} hearing {{related to}} the 2001 shoplifting incident (see below), Ryder's attorney, <b>Mark</b> <b>Geragos,</b> referred to her work with the Polly Klaas Foundation and other charitable causes.

500|$|The {{concerns}} about a civil trial during an ongoing criminal investigation, {{and about the}} prosecutor's access to the plaintiff's information in the civil trial, stemmed from Jackson's Fifth Amendment rights. As two grand juries had deemed there was insufficient evidence for charges as of January 1, the prosecution {{might have been able}} to form the elements of a criminal case around the defense strategy in the civil trial; creating a situation akin to double jeopardy. For instance, prosecutor Tom Sneddon altered fundamental elements of his case in 2004 after evidence undermining the Arvizo family's 2003 allegations appeared after Jackson's initial arraignment. Upon discovery of two taped interviews in which the Arvizo family praised Jackson and denied any abuse, Sneddon introduced a conspiracy charge and claimed they were forced to lie against their will. And when Jackson was re-arraigned in April 2004 for the conspiracy charge, the dates of the alleged molestation on the charge sheet had been shifted by almost two weeks. Jackson's lawyer, <b>Mark</b> <b>Geragos,</b> had announced on NBC in January 2004 that his client had a [...] "concrete, iron-clad alibi" [...] for the dates on the charge sheet.|$|E

2500|$|Hours after Bonds was indicted, Greg Anderson {{was ordered}} {{released}} from prison.

I read the indictment and there is nothing that the government didn't have a year ago to indict Bonds. My guy was nonessential."

2500|$|Jackson was arraigned on January 16, 2004, at {{the court}} in Santa Maria. He was admonished by the judge for {{arriving}} 20 minutes late. Jackson was represented by attorneys <b>Mark</b> <b>Geragos,</b> Benjamin Brafman, Steve Cochran, and Robert Sanger. Jackson entered a plea of [...] "not guilty." [...] Judge Melville turned down a media request for publication of 82 pages of documents and related tape recordings {{on the grounds of}} violation of the parties' privacy rights and complicating the process of selecting an unbiased jury. The request concerned the boy's accounts of alleged happenings, interviews with his family, statements made during the child's psychological counseling, and information about the Chandlers' case.|$|E
2500|$|On April 25, 2004, <b>Mark</b> <b>Geragos</b> and Ben Brafman were {{replaced}} as Jackson's lead counsel by one-time Robert Blake defense attorneys Thomas Mesereau and Susan Yu. Steve Cochran and Robert Sanger continued to represent Mr. Jackson, although Cochran left the team prior to trial (See transcripts for case no. 1133603). [...] The second arraignment {{was held on}} April 30, 2004. Brian Oxman was brought onto the team by Mesereau. The new charges, to which Jackson pleaded [...] "not guilty", were similar to the earlier ones, allegedly [...] "on or about and between" [...] February 20 and March 12, 2003, but {{with the addition of}} conspiracy involving child abduction, false imprisonment and extortion. The first two referred to the allegation that the accuser, although he was free to move within Neverland, was at some stages not allowed to leave the ranch, even when his mother wanted this to occur.|$|E
