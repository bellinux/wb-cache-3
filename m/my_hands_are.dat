500|$|My [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] {{video was}} {{completely}} inspired {{by all the}} female surrealist painters like Leonora Carrington and Remedios Varo. There's that one shot where <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> {{up in the air}} and stars are spinning around me. And me flying through the hallway with my hair trailing behind me, the birds flying out of my open robe– all of those images were an homage to female surrealist painters; there's a little bit of Frida Kahlo in there, too.|$|E
500|$|Although Verlaine {{was against}} drug use after Television formed, {{he once had}} a {{short-lived}} phase using psychedelic drugs, to which he makes reference in similes on songs such as [...] "Venus". The vignette-like lyrics follow an ostensibly drug-induced, revelatory experience: [...] "You know it's all like some new kind of drug / my senses are sharp and <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> like gloves / Broadway looks so medieval, it seems to flap like little pages / I fell sideways laughing, with a friend from many stages." [...] According to Waterman, although psychedelic trips informed the experiences of many artists in lower Manhattan at the time, [...] "Venus" [...] contributed to the impression of Marquee Moon as a transcendental work in the vein of 19th-century Romanticism: [...] "Verlaine is into perception, and sometimes the perception he represents is as intense as a mind-altering substance." [...] Christgau said the lyric about Broadway lent the album its association among critics to the East Village, as it [...] "situates this philosophical action in the downtown night".|$|E
500|$|Linda S. Ghent, Professor in the Department of Economics at Eastern Illinois University, {{discusses}} {{some economic}} {{issues in this}} episode. Just before Jerry's dare about the egg roll, Elaine says, [...] "You know, it's not fair people are seated first come first served. It {{should be based on}} who's hungriest. I feel like just going over there and taking some food off somebody's plate." [...] Ghent discusses the history and reasoning behind rationing mechanisms and economic efficiency, which are the bases behind how tables are seated at restaurants, rationales which are perhaps invisible to hungry or impatient customers. Elaine's attempt at bribery is an example of opportunity cost: the trio are willing to pay more than usual to get a table, if it means Elaine can eat sooner and Jerry makes it to the movie on time. Ghent also gives Jerry's willingness to lie to his uncle as another example of opportunity cost: [...] "Did I do a bad thing by lying to my uncle and saying I couldn't go to dinner? Plan Nine from Outer Space – one night only, the big screen! <b>My</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> tied!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, after a {{long period}} of radio silence, the {{official}} Cardiacs website relaunched with many pieces of merchandise for sale. Among other updates, an amendment to the 'History' section of the site humorously addressed Tim Smith's accident, subsequent incapacitation and the band's hiatus: [...] And so for five years, history ceased to be created by Cardiacs. Unless we consider the undignified shenanigans of Tim Smith who ‘fell’ into a pool filled with shit and is still crawling and scratching his way out of it. The ALPHABET BUSINESS CONCERN wishes it to be known that, whilst maintaining complete control of his artistic output, they disassociate themselves ENTIRELY with his recent illness and, in fact, fail to recognise it as an excuse for not fulfilling his duties. [...] A message was also posted from Tim Smith's personal Facebook account: [...] Hello Kidz! (You will notice that I spelled the word kidz with a 'z'). I have been bowled over and knocked back by the outpourings of love, posted on here. Every one of them. You have no idea what this means. Really though. While I would love to respond to each message, you are doubtlessly aware, my body is my enemy and <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> cunts. Nonetheless it means the world to me, thank you all so much. I am truly blessed. [...] Sporadic status updates continue to be posted on Smith's Facebook page, which readily accepts friend requests of fans.|$|E

2500|$|Wallenda did not falter or totter in the {{slightest}} during his walk, nor did he stop to do any extra tricks during the walk (as he often does). Talking to ABC reporters live, {{as he entered the}} final phase of the trip he admitted, [...] "I'm drained... <b>My</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> going numb. I feel like I'm getting weak." [...] Later he said, [...] "my forearm just started to cramp worse than it ever has been before", attributing it the stress of the day. Near the end, he stopped, got down on one knee, and blew a kiss to the crowd. He got up, pumped his fist, and ran the final few steps. He completed the crossing at 10:41p.m. EDT, 25 minutes after he started. In so doing, Wallenda became the first person to cross directly over Niagara Falls on a high-wire. In the 1800s, a few tightrope walkers had crossed over the Niagara Gorge down river, but none had ever crossed directly over the Falls. He also set the world record for longest walk over a waterfall. [...] Prior to Wallenda, the last person to cross the river on tightrope was James Hardy in 1896. According to Wallenda, it was the longest unsupported tightrope walk in history. [...] He carried his passport on the trip and was required to present it to Canadian border guards waiting for him upon his arrival on the Canadian side of the falls.|$|E
2500|$|The Salt Lake Tribune {{said that}} the album [...] "largely drops the punk-by-numbers that {{dominated}} past efforts {{to get a little}} more personal lyrically, thus becoming more approachable." [...] Alan Sculley of The Daily Herald explained that, [...] "Coming Home pretty much leaves any punk element behind. The songs still rock - just note the wallop delivered by [...] "Hold My Hand" [...] or [...] "Connected." [...] But the band pulls back on the tempos of virtually all of the songs." [...] Scene Point Blank writer Chris Abraham noted, [...] "Coming Home still encompasses the things that make New Found Glory great. Relatable lyrics, hooks so melodic and catchy that <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> red from not buying a mitt, and, despite a mellower tone, I could still imagine myself going fucking nuts singing along to these songs live." [...] AbsolutePunk founder Jason Tate warned that, [...] "it's crucial you abandon any pre-conceived expectations for this album. If you're anticipating the band's previous albums re-hashed, you're going to be completely let-down. While the choruses and sing-a-long hooks could compete with the best on any of their previous albums - it's the slower melodic approach to the songs that truly makes the album come alive and fully breathe." [...] Rae Alexandra of Kerrang! magazine called the album a [...] "massive departure" [...] and suggested that, [...] "NFG are taking what will be, by far, the biggest gamble of their career. Some of you won't even recognise them immediately; it's not fast, it's not forced, but - in an entirely new way - it soars." [...] In an earlier Kerrang! article discussing the album, Alexandra wrote that [...] "It's Not Your Fault" [...] displays [...] "more maturity - and piano - than ever before", while [...] "When I Die" [...] is [...] "low key with orchestral accents", making it [...] "one of the most beautiful moments on Coming Home." [...] Corey Apar of AllMusic was in agreement and stated that [...] "from the album's packaging to the comfortable nature of the music, it actually feels more mature {{in a way that is}} catchy without seeming to care about radio accessibility." ...|$|E
