5|$|Marie St. Clare – Wife of Augustine, {{she is a}} self-absorbed woman {{without a}} hint of {{compassion}} for those around her, including her own family. Given to an unending list of (apparently imaginary) physical <b>maladies,</b> she continually complains about the lack of sympathy she is receiving. She has separated her personal maid, Mammy, from her own two children because they would interfere with her duties. As Marie drives Mammy to exhaustion, she criticizes her for selfishly seeking to attend her own family. Upon the unexpected death of Augustine, Marie countermands the legal process that would have given Tom his freedom.|$|E

5|$|Physical {{examination}} typically reveals {{fluid in}} the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The tenderness may initially spread, but often reverts to a well-defined focal point as the lesion progresses. Just as OCD shares symptoms with common <b>maladies,</b> acute osteochondral fracture {{has a similar}} presentation with tenderness in the affected joint, but is usually associated with a fatty hemarthrosis. Although {{there is no significant}} pathologic gait or characteristic alignment abnormality associated with OCD, the patient may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid tibial spine impingement on the lateral aspect of the medial condyle of the femur.|$|E
5|$|The giraffe's neck {{vertebrae}} have {{ball and}} socket joints. In particular, the atlas–axis joint (C1 and C2) allows the animal to tilt its head vertically and reach more branches with the tongue. The point of articulation between the cervical and thoracic vertebrae of giraffes is shifted to lie {{between the first and}} second thoracic vertebrae (T1 and T2), unlike most other ruminants where the articulation is between the seventh cervical vertebra (C7) and T1. This allows C7 to contribute directly to increased neck length and has given rise to the suggestion that T1 is actually C8, and that giraffes have added an extra cervical vertebra. However, this proposition is not generally accepted, as T1 has other morphological features, such as an articulating rib, deemed diagnostic of thoracic vertebrae, and because exceptions to the mammalian limit of seven cervical vertebrae are generally characterised by increased neurological anomalies and <b>maladies.</b>|$|E

Each reading has been in different languages - often local languages, with a different performer and with various visual outcomes. Yang's staging of The <b>Malady</b> of Death is characterised by an inconclusive uncertainty and the unknown, much like Duras' original text. The performative outcome of The <b>Malady</b> of Death is autonomous from the aesthetic of Yang's other work.|$|R

25|$|Before a {{diagnosis}} of allergic disease can be confirmed, other possible causes of the presenting symptoms should be considered.

25|$|The devotional {{practices}} of Sufis vary widely.

25|$|Of the {{commercial}} aromatic bitters that would {{emerge from this}} period, perhaps the most well known is Angostura bitters. In spite of its name, the preparation contains no medicinal bark from the angostura tree; instead it is named after the town of Angostura, today's Ciudad Bolívar, in Venezuela. In 1824, German physician Dr. Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert compounded a cure for sea sickness and stomach <b>maladies,</b> among other medicinal uses. Dr. Siegert subsequently formed the House of Angostura to sell the bitters to sailors.|$|E

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the extent of awareness about Pregnancy Specific Hipertensive <b>Malady</b> among infected women, and their feelings regarding the <b>Malady.</b> The proposed study method was exploratory and descriptive. Pregnant women and those in a labor process, {{in a total of}} twenty-one women, made up the sample. A questionnaire form was used basically to verify their social economic profile, obstetric antecedents, degree of awareness, and also how they were feeling since the disease came up. After that, the statements were organized through the deduction method proposed by Laurence Bardin, and also through all the bibliographic pile researched. The results showed that women have a certain degree of understanding the <b>Malady.</b> They are not, however, conscious of the gravity of this disease; they are not informed of the risks and complications involved. They do have a little information that comes from their relatives and friends. The study also observed that they are anxious to get at home and very worried about their families. They are insecure regarding the procedures and methods used, afraid of their own deaths and fears, and principally worried for not knowing exactly what is the <b>Malady</b> Disease. It was concluded that the infected women by the <b>Malady</b> Disease could become more vulnerable and more capable to deal with innumerous difficulties if they had the opportunity to be informed about the <b>Malady</b> Disease, and also to expose their fears and anxieties under a special care...|$|R
