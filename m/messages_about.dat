25|$|On {{account of}} the {{evolution}} of society today; text messaging, e-mails, social media, and other technological advancements, have dominated an individual’s sequence of physical interactions. Although technology provides the convenience of connecting with others, its association with the media has resulted in a “platform of delivery in which we intercept and interpret <b>messages</b> <b>about</b> ourselves, our self-worth, and our bodies”. According to a study by Dove, only 4% of women thought they were beautiful, while approximately 70% of women and girls believed the media’s portrayal of impractical beauty standards fuelled their appearance anxieties. As a result, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported that, 91% of women were most unhappy with their bodies, while 40% will consider cosmetic surgery to fix their flaws.|$|E
25|$|Barkley {{came under}} fire by some in 2006, due to his {{criticism}} of Los Angeles Laker Kobe Bryant. After Game 6 of the Lakers' first round series against the Phoenix Suns (when Bryant scored 50 points and the Lakers lost in overtime), Barkley criticized him for scoring too much and not getting his teammates involved. After Game 7 of the same series (when Bryant did not score and hardly attempted any shots in the second half), Barkley ripped him for being unselfish. Some columnists thought that Barkley was being hypocritical. Bryant and Barkley exchanged several text <b>messages</b> <b>about</b> the issue, and during {{the second round of}} the playoffs, Bryant appeared on TNT's studio show. Bryant and Barkley had a mild debate about the issue, and some observers thought that Barkley was too easy on Bryant, considering his previous comments about him.|$|E
