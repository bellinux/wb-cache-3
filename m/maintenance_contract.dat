In May that year four C-130s flew a rifle company of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, from Townsville to Norfolk Island during Operation Morris Dance, the Australian Defence Force's response to the first of the 1987 Fijian coups; the soldiers subsequently embarked onto RAN warships by helicopter. In 1988, No.37 Squadron's Hercules achieved 200,000accident-free flying hours. No.36 Squadron achieved 100,000accident-free flying hours on the C-130H in 1990. Members of the travelling public experienced flying by Hercules in 1989, when the Australian Government employed the C-130s and 707s for transport during the pilots' dispute that curtailed operations by the two domestic airlines; the resulting spike in operational hours necessitated No.486 Squadron sending detachments to several locations throughout the country to cope with increased maintenance demands. By the late 1980s, some C-130 maintenance tasks had been outsourced to commercial firms, and Air New Zealand won a four-year depot <b>maintenance</b> <b>contract</b> in 1990.|$|E

This study collected CO data on road <b>maintenance</b> <b>contracts</b> to determine the amount of CO and the most frequent and high-risk road maintenance activities that had CO. A Delphi study was conducted with 33 maintenance engineers from the state Department of Transportation (DOT) to identify causes of CO and its impact on cost and schedule of road <b>maintenance</b> <b>contracts.</b> The results showed that the three important reasons of CO on the <b>maintenance</b> <b>contracts</b> were: changes in work scope, errors in the estimate, and failure to verify work site conditions before signing a contract. To reduce these CO, three most important preventive measures agreed by participants were: reviewing specifications, preparing accurate estimates, and reviewing the design drawing before bid solicitation. In this study, the CO contingency estimation tool was prepared using an artificial neural network (ANN) and a linear regression method. Historical CO data was used to predict the contingency cost for <b>maintenance</b> <b>contracts.</b> In order to reduce the negative impact on the schedule-growth, a schedule-crashing optimization tool was also developed. Hence, the primary contributions of this research to the body of knowledge are the quantification of the CO, the identification of the causes and preventive measures of CO, and the development of the tools to manage cost and schedule growth in road <b>maintenance</b> <b>contracts...</b>|$|R
