Consequently, {{there are differences in}} grossing and netting procedures for the <b>main</b> <b>aggregates.</b> In MPS, many services are not regarded as value-adding, and therefore excluded from total net output. As the name suggests, the MPS aims to measure the annual output of material goods, in contrast with services. In MPS the economy is divided up into three sectors: (1) socialist productive enterprises, (2) the non-productive sphere, and (3) households. Typically the planning authorities also collected comprehensive data on the physical units of products produced. This is normally not the case in conventional national accounts, which measure only the value of outputs produced.|$|E

We find that this approach gives predictions that are consistent with the time series properties of Venezuela when i) the income effect of consumption more than compensates the substitution effect that generates the oil transfer and, ii) there is imperfect capital mobility.

40|$|The {{effects of}} land-use {{change on the}} {{structure}} of Oxisols in the Brazilian savannas (also known as the Cerrados) are still insufficiently understood. We therefore studied loamy and clayey Oxisols under natural savanna, crop, pasture, and reforestation to (1) quantify management-induced changes in the quantity of water-stable aggregates, (2) identify the <b>main</b> <b>aggregating</b> agents, and (3) correlate aggregation with changes in pore-size distribution. Clayey soils showed a significantly higher macroaggregation than did loamy soils. Compared with natural savanna, macroaggregation was clearly reduced under crops, whereas aggregation of soils under pasture and tree plantations was only slightly affected. In both clayey and loamy soils, polysaccharides formed the <b>main</b> <b>aggregating</b> agent. In the clayey soils, lime very effectively disaggregated the soils by weakening the electrostatic forces between positively and negatively charged soil compounds. In the loamy soils, the role of roots in binding macroaggregates was significant. Because pastures provide strong rooting and high polysaccharide production, we recommend introducing crop/pasture rotations. Management-induced disaggregation strongly affected the pore-size distribution by compacting the soils, and thus reducing macroporosity and increasing mesoporosity. Microporosity, however, was unaffected by management and differed only between the two substrates. Considering the Oxisols` typically low pore space at plant-available matrix potentials, the increase in mesoporosity may be important for annual crops during the frequent dry spells in the rainy season...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{analyses}} {{the results}} of several series of tests performed on composite concrete-steel slabs. The objectives of the tests are to: 1) determine the bending moment capacity 2) study the different failure modes 3) compare the theoretically calculated bending moment with the experimentally tested bending moment. The following variables {{are included in the}} test series: 1) length of the composite slabs, 2) width of the composite slab 3) thickness of the composite slab 4) steel plate cross sectional dimensions (width and thickness), 5) number of bonded steel plates and 6) loading configurations applied onto the simply supported slab (mid span line load or third span line load to simulate uniformly distributed loads). The reinforcing bars within the composite slab were kept the same for all series of tests. The composite concrete-steel slabs were formed by bonding steel plates to the soffits of reinforced concrete slabs by means of epoxy glue. In order to obtain full composite action the epoxy glue between the concrete slab and steel plate must be able to transfer the generated shear forces. To achieve the bond between the concrete and steel plate surfaces, the bonded surfaces had to be roughened. The concrete surfaces were roughened by either exposing the <b>main</b> concrete <b>aggregate</b> using brushes, chiselling the concrete paste layer to expose the <b>main</b> <b>aggregate</b> or by scabbeling the cement laitance to expose the <b>main</b> <b>aggregate</b> as per the epoxy supplier’s specifications. The mild steel plates were sand blasted with a dry grid to a white metal finish in order to obtain a 100 - 140 micron blast profile as per the epoxy supplier’s specification. Pro-StructLV low viscosity epoxy adhesive was used to bind the epoxy to the concrete surface and Pro-Struct 617 NS non-sag epoxy was used to bind the steel to the concrete surface. In tests where full composite action between the steel plates and the concrete slabs was realised, an increase of up to 200 % in the bending moment capacity of the slab was realised. The composite concrete-steel slabs failed either by debonding of the steel plate(s), flexural bending or vertical shearing of the composite syste...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} {{application of}} national accounts {{is in the}} formulation of socio-economic policy. This paper starts out with a discussion of the current situation in the Netherlands. Subsequently, it identifies several universal trends (more micro-oriented policy formulation, globalization, the rise of the flexible service economy and the increasing intertwinement of economic, social and environmental policies) and outlines how the national accounts might be adapted and extended so as to enhance its role as the core information system for policy formulation at the macro- and meso-level. Right from the start of national accounting in the Netherlands, its usefulness for economic policy has been borne in mind (see Den Bakker, 1993). In this regard, the national accounts have performed a dual function. First, the accounts, and particularly the <b>main</b> <b>aggregates,</b> serve to monitor the performance of econ-omic policy.

While in most recent quantitative business cycle studies the proportional tax is introduced due to the easy tractability of this tax struture, the presence of a progressive tax on labor income, which is common to all economies the business cycle studies try to mimic, could introduce some important and distictive features into the cycle's statistical properties under analysis. The summary statistics of the dynamic pattern of the <b>main</b> <b>aggregate</b> variables show a clear e ect of the introduction of progressive labor income taxes.
