25|$|The {{stand now}} {{comprises}} only one level of timber tiered seating (originally two), with slatted timber benches and back rests, supported on steel frames {{bolted to the}} floor. The seating is accessed via three sets of brick and concrete stairs {{at the front of}} the stand. These are located at either end of the structure and in the middle, the central stair having a double staircase. Set into the front brick wall of each staircase is an inscribed stone plaque. That at the southeast end reads: This stone was laid by CE McDougall, President 18th Nov 1922 J Hutchinson, Builder. That in the centre stair reads: This stone was laid by His Excellency, Sir Matthew Nathan PC, GCMG, Governor of Queensland 18th Nov 1922 Richard Gailey Jnr FOIA, Architect. That on the northwest stair reads: This stone was laid by Ernest Baynes, Chairman, for and on behalf of the Council 18th Nov 1922. This stone also records the names of the 13 other RNA Councillors of the day and the Secretary. The front and staircase balustrades are of decorative cast iron with timber handrails, but the side balustrades are a later <b>metal</b> <b>grille.</b> At the top of the seating, later fire-exit doors have been cut in the brick rear wall at either end – these lead to fire-escape stairs.|$|E
500|$|The ESL {{measures}} [...] {{and weighs}} [...] In terms of appearance, the original ESL has an expanded <b>metal</b> <b>grille,</b> and three little wooden feet. The earlier version has golden-bronze grilles and classic teak end caps. Later production versions have black grilles, and end caps have a rosewood finish; other minor variants exist. The speaker's electronics components, consisting mainly of an audio transformer, EHT power supply, crossover and mains transformer, are {{fixed to the}} base of the cabinet.|$|E
500|$|For much of 1931, Stackpole {{partnered with}} other artists to {{decorate}} Pflueger's Paramount Theatre in Oakland, an Art Deco masterpiece. A bas-relief scene of horses, waves and a central winged figure was {{placed over the}} stage's proscenium arch, finished in gold-toned metal leaf—the work jointly designed by Stackpole and Robert Boardman Howard. The design worked into Pflueger's <b>metal</b> <b>grille</b> ceiling grid likely came unattributed from Stackpole's sketches. Pflueger was an able project leader; Stackpole later described his involvement: [...] "He was the boss alright, as an architect should be... He would call the plays just as a symphony conductor does... There wasn't a lock, molding, or window {{that he did not}} inspect in the drawings and in the actual building with the utmost thoroughness and care." ...|$|E

2500|$|In addition, the {{inscription}} on the gravestone of [...] third son , the 8th headmaster of the Kashima Shinden Jikishinkage-ryū Kenjutsu, states that his exploits included improving the bokuto and shinai, and refining the armour {{by adding a}} <b>metal</b> <b>grille</b> to the men (head piece) and thick cotton protective coverings to the kote (gauntlets). Kunisato inherited the tradition from his father Heizaemon in 1708, {{and the two of}} them worked hard together to improve the bogu until Heizaemon's death.|$|E
2500|$|Land Rover 127s {{were built}} on a special {{production}} line, and all started life as 110 4x4 chassis (the model was initially marketed as the 110 crew cab, before the more logical 127 name was adopted). These were then cut in two and the [...] of extra chassis length welded on before the two original halves were reunited. These models did not receive their own dedicated badging like the other two models, instead they used the same <b>metal</b> <b>grille</b> badges as used on the Series III 109 V8 models, that simply said [...] "Land-Rover".|$|E
2500|$|Lining the {{perimeter}} walls to Brookes Street and Gregory Terrace are horse stables. The stables are in long timber buildings with skillion roofs clad with corrugated iron. The buildings comprise {{back to back}} stalls and are arranged with narrow [...] "lanes" [...] between them. The holding capacity must be well over a hundred horses and the individual accommodation is fairly standard – each has a concrete floor, single door and window space filled with a <b>metal</b> <b>grille.</b> The concrete has been roughed up by stamping a rough lattice pattern into it over most areas. There is a horse washing area against the wall where the floor is rough concrete and pebble and the bays are divided by vertical corrugated metal panels.|$|E
2500|$|The Mobile Brigade {{has ordered}} 2 Komodo APCs. These {{are to be}} {{customized}} for [...] "Jungle Warfare" [...] operations, which includes missions in urban and jungle areas. The Mobile Brigade has placed an additional order of 10 Komodos. They will have <b>metal</b> <b>grilles</b> installed on all windows due to their involvement in BRIMOB operations, which includes the suppression of violent demonstrations and riots.|$|R
50|$|Armour kits from tired Hotspurs were fitted onto brand-new Land Rover Defender 110 {{civilian}} chassis. When donor kits ran out, the RUC workshops {{began to}} fabricate brand-new ones. The vehicles' headlights were initially protected from damage by transparent polycarbonate shields, {{but these were}} quickly found to be less durable than the original <b>metal</b> <b>grilles</b> of the Hotspur and were replaced. At {{the front and rear}} of the roof each of the Tangis were fitted with a remotely controlled spotlight and a rotating blue warning light, all protected by expanded <b>metal</b> <b>grilles.</b> The Hotspur's side skirts were retained, as was its fire protection system. In addition, burning petrol was prevented from entering the engine bay by a fabric strip around the bonnet edge and at the hinge between the bonnet and the front bulkhead. Further, the engine radiator was protected from damage with a substantial louvred grill fabricated from 3 mm steel sheet.|$|R
50|$|The {{basement}} of the 1896 building, has painted brickwork walls lined throughout with storage shelves. A strongroom is located beneath the ground floor strongroom adjacent to a fireplace. The ceilings are lined with tongue and groove boards and the floor is formed with concrete. The rear wall contains a central door and two full height windows with double hung sashes secured with <b>metal</b> <b>grilles.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Series III had {{the same}} body and engine options as the {{preceding}} IIa, including station wagons and the 1 Ton versions. Little changed cosmetically from the IIA to the Series III. The Series III {{is the most common}} Series vehicle, with 440,000 of the type built from 1971 to 1985. The headlights were moved to the wings on late production IIA models from 1968/9 onward (ostensibly to comply with Australian, American and Dutch lighting regulations) and remained in this position for the Series III. The traditional <b>metal</b> <b>grille,</b> featured on the Series I, II and IIA, was replaced with a plastic one for the Series III model. The 2.25-litre engine had its compression raised from 7:1 to 8:1, increasing the power slightly (the high compression engine had been an optional fit on the IIa model for several years). During the Series III production run from 1971 until 1985, the 1,000,000th Land Rover rolled off the production line in 1976. The Series III saw many changes in the later part of its life as Land Rover updated the design to meet increased competition. This was the first model to feature synchromesh on all four gears, although some late H-suffix SIIA models (mainly the more expensive Station Wagons) had used the all-synchro box. In keeping with early 1970s trends in automotive interior design, both in safety and use of more advanced materials, the simple metal dashboard of earlier models was redesigned to accept a new moulded plastic dash. The instrument cluster, which was previously centrally located, was moved to the driver's side. Long-wheelbase Series III vehicles had the Salisbury rear axle (the differential housing and axle case are one piece) as standard, although some late SIIA [...] vehicles had them too.|$|E

50|$|The {{courtroom}} {{is located}} on the second floor. Cardiff green marble encircles the base of the room. American walnut paneling is laid in a herringbone pattern and topped with a scalloped band of wood. The scalloped motif is repeated in <b>metal</b> <b>grilles</b> and furniture. The most elaborate feature of the room is the plaster cornice with carved dentils, leaves, floral designs, and chevrons highlighted with metallic paint.|$|R
50|$|It retains many {{original}} finishes, {{from black}} and white checkerboard terrazzo flooring, black marble borders and baseboard and veined gray marble wainscoting to seven feet (7 ft) along the walls. Above is a plaster wall and ceiling with molded cornice. The insides of the windows are also recessed and decorated with beaded molding. The screenline features unusual angled glass and <b>metal</b> <b>grilles</b> above the teller windows and lockboxes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{steps and}} landing stages {{have been closed}} to the public for many years. In 1935 less {{elaborate}} steps were in place, some of which remained until 1971. [...] Photographs taken in 1972 show the arches to be barred, some are covered with <b>metal</b> <b>grilles.</b> As of 2009 none of the steps remain, and the original Victorian railings along the embankment have been replaced with a stone wall and new railings.|$|R

50|$|The Jamaica Savings Bank {{building}}, {{located in}} the Jamaica section of the borough of Queens in New York City, was built between 1897 and 1898 in the Beaux-Arts style. It is a slender four story brick building with a limestone facade. It features a deeply rusticated ground floor with windows protected by elegant <b>metal</b> <b>grilles.</b> The facade is framed by double-story pilasters and covered with elaborate carved brackets, swags and other elements.|$|R
50|$|The corner tower has a {{wedge-shaped}} pavilion roof, {{reminiscent of}} a Loire Valley château; it is tiled in shaped green Westmorland slates. The projecting entrance porch is Corinthian in style, featuring a semi-circular arch and fluted pilasters supporting a first-floor balcony with ball finials to the balustrade. There is a similar balustraded balcony to the drawing room {{to the south of}} the porch. The porch windows feature <b>metal</b> <b>grilles</b> with scroll and leaf decoration.|$|R
500|$|In 1989, a new {{marketing}} {{position was}} needed for the US market. As the rising Pound Sterling made the product much more expensive for US customers, {{it was decided to}} improve the specification of the ESL-63 and target the $4,000 price point with a [...] "US Monitor" [...] version. It was modelled on the more rugged [...] "professional" [...] model that possessed <b>metal</b> <b>grilles</b> and a steel frame (instead of aluminium) which had been created for the recording division of Philips.|$|R

25|$|The {{interior}} is well detailed and executed with dark stained timber joinery throughout, {{except for the}} contrasting honey-coloured boards that line the raked ceiling. Finely detailed trusses, supported on concrete corbels, incorporate semi-circular laminated arches of three vertical layers, bolted and strapped together at intervals. Within the semi-circular apse, the ceiling boards are tapered to a narrow point to form a conical peak. Decorative timber grilles along {{the apex of the}} nave and chancel ceiling combined with <b>metal</b> <b>grilles</b> in the chancel window sills are elements of the original ventilation system.|$|R
50|$|Inside {{the modern}} double doors open into a wooden {{vestibule}} articulated by narrow paneled pilasters and multi-pane sash. The main lobby floor is {{of red and}} brown ceramic tile with a red border and buff wainscoting. Above that the walls and ceiling, including the cornice between them, is plaster. Many original features, including the screenline, <b>metal</b> <b>grilles,</b> lockboxes, interior doors and surrounds, two wooden customer tables, one set of lockboxes and a bulletin case. A mural depicting ships on the canal is high {{on the wall above}} the postmaster's office.|$|R
50|$|The main {{entrance}} {{is marked by}} three opening with <b>metal</b> <b>grilles</b> that date {{from the beginning of}} the 20th century. Inside the entrance, there is a wide nave with a groin vault and two large murals by Roberto Montenegro. There are two interior courtyards that are joined by a stairway that was added by Miguel Constanzó in the 18th century. In the hallway to the first courtyard are allegories of Mexico, Spain, India, Greece and reliefs that allude to the arts by sculpture Miguel Centurión in the passage to the second courtyard.|$|R
5000|$|Styling {{changes on}} the 1972 Ambassador were limited to a new {{crosshatch}} cast <b>metal</b> <b>grille</b> with bright trim and new integrated fender extension mounted side marker lamps on the front. Brougham station wagons included a roof rack, rear air deflector, as well as 3M [...] "dinoc" [...] woodgrain trim on body sides and tailgate.|$|E
50|$|The {{mathematician}} and educator David Eugene Smith {{asserted that}} lattice multiplication {{was brought to}} Italy from the Middle East. This is reinforced by noting that the Arabic term for the method, shabakh, has the same meaning as the Italian term for the method, gelosia, namely, the <b>metal</b> <b>grille</b> or grating (lattice) for a window.|$|E
50|$|From 1946 to 1950 he {{attended}} the Escuela National de Belles Artes in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

50|$|A typical türbe {{mausoleum}} {{is located}} in the grounds of a mosque or complex, often endowed by the deceased. However some are more closely integrated into surrounding buildings. They are usually relatively small buildings, often hexagonal or octagonal in shape, containing a single chamber, which may well be decorated with coloured tiles. A dome normally surmounts the building. They are normally kept closed, but the inside can be sometimes be glimpsed through <b>metal</b> <b>grilles</b> over the windows or door. The exterior is typically masonry, perhaps with tiled decoration over the doorway, but the interior often contains large areas of painted tilework, which may be of the highest quality.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} is {{as impressive as}} the exterior. In 1992, the U.S. General Services Administration restored major public spaces to their original splendor. The lobby, which runs {{the length of the}} building, contains a barrel-vaulted ceiling with arched openings that contain geometric, <b>metal</b> <b>grilles.</b> Also in the lobby, the patterned tile floor, green-and-gold starburst ceiling stencils, brass chandeliers, and bronze elevator doors were restored. Elaborate ceilings in the courtrooms, some of which contain skylights with grilles, were refurbished. An ornamental painted ceiling was added to the ninth-floor courtroom. Although the ceiling was shown as part of the architect's original design, it was not executed during construction in 1932.|$|R
