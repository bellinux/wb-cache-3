By default (when no family reasons or humanitarian grounds are present), the first member state that an asylum seeker entered and in which they have been fingerprinted is responsible. If the asylum seeker then moves to another member state, they can be transferred back to the member state they first entered. This has led many to criticise the Dublin rules for placing too much responsibility for asylum seekers on member states on the EU's external borders (like Italy, Greece and Hungary), instead of devising a burden-sharing system among EU states.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} often-voiced {{concern that the}} {{expanding}} activities of international organizations lead to an 'accountability gap' {{in the sense that}} if potentially harmful activities are carried out through an international organization, neither the organization nor its <b>member</b> <b>States</b> can effectively be held to account. Many international organizations are only beginning to establish procedural remedies through which the lawfulness of their activities can be reviewed. In the absence of a direct remedy against the organization, third parties often try to hold the <b>member</b> <b>States</b> <b>responsible</b> in relation to the organization's activities. This thesis investigates under what circumstances <b>member</b> <b>States</b> can be held responsible for wrongful conduct taken within the framework of an international organization. It deals comprehensively with the attribution of conduct in multilateral contexts, with complicity as a ground of <b>member</b> <b>State</b> responsibility, with reparation for injuries committed by multiple responsible parties and with the judicial enforcement of <b>member</b> <b>State</b> responsibility. In doing so, it demonstrates how with the transposition of the rules on international responsibility to the context of international organizations, certain rules of State responsibility, well-established in an exclusively inter-State context, have been opened up to fundamental questions. The separate legal personality of international organizations can in fact be seen as creating an 'institutional veil' which makes it more difficult to 'see through' and hold <b>States</b> <b>responsible</b> for their conduct qua members. This thesis argues that the possibility of holding <b>member</b> <b>States</b> <b>responsible</b> for unlawful conduct taken within the framework of international organizations not only counters the risk that States could use them as vehicles to carry out unlawful acts, but that it also serves as an incentive for <b>member</b> <b>States</b> to create better procedural remedies against their international organizations. </p...|$|R

5000|$|The law {{provides}} for the granting of asylum or refugee status {{in accordance with the}} 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 protocol, and the government has established a system for providing protection to refugees. In practice the government provided protection against refoulement, the return of persons to a country where they feared persecution. The government granted refugee status or asylum and subscribed to a [...] "safe country of transit" [...] policy, which required asylum seekers who transited a country determined to be [...] "safe" [...] to return to that country to seek refugee status. With the expansion of the European Union (EU) this concept has lost some of its importance because upon their accession, neighboring Slovenia, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, and Hungary became subject to the EU provisions that establish criteria and mechanisms for determining the EU <b>member</b> <b>state</b> <b>responsible</b> for examining an asylum application. In 2005 new legislation introduced stricter detention and removal policies as part of a stronger enforcement of the 2003 Dublin II regulation (also referred to as the Dublin Convention) which discourages asylum shopping by allowing serial asylum-seekers to be returned to the EU country where they first applied for asylum. EURODAC, the EU's system for comparing fingerprints of asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants, has facilitated the application of the Dublin Convention. As a result, asylum applications dropped by more than 30 percent during the year with a noticeable trend in applicants attempting to conceal their routes of transit.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to analyze {{the application of the}} Dublin system in the Czech Republic. The descriptive part of the thesis is mapping the development of the Dublin system, criteria and mechanisms for determining the <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>responsible</b> for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States, and Eurodac database, complementing the entire Dublin system. The descriptive part is followed by analytical part. This part analyzes the Dublin cases and their links to asylum requests. Specifically, it is concerned with the number of Dublin cases in the Czech Republic together with their breakdown to sent and received requests and also breakdown according to nationalities of the Dublin cases. The analysis concludes that the Dublin mode contributed to the decrease of the asylum requests in the Czech Republic, but it has not influenced the nationality composition of the asylum seekers.

40|$|This article {{demonstrates}} how {{the transfer of}} competences in asylum policy from Member States to the European Union, although guided by the objective of improving and harmonising diverse standards, has not resulted in a satisfactory level of refugee protection.

The article analyses the Dublin II Regulation (establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>responsible</b> for examining asylum applications), which by failing to provide an effective mechanism for responsibility allocation has made the entire asylum system in the European Union dysfunctional and of questionable conformity with the Geneva Convention of 1951 and other international standards of protection.

40|$|The {{subject matter}} of my thesis is the Dublin system which {{includes}} the Council Regulation (EC) No 343 / 2003 of 18.

The aim of this thesis is to acquaint its readers, point out the shortcomings and benefits of the existing regulation and evaluate the application of both regulations. I was trying to explain the functioning of this system {{with the help of the}} cases of ECHR and CJEU. My thesis is divided into five chapters. In the first chapter, I focused on the development of a common European asylum system before the adoption of the Regulation and then also at the Regulation itself and the objectives it observes. The second chapter is devoted to the principles and criteria for determining the responsibility of the Member State to examine an asylum application.

40|$|In this chapter, I take a {{different}} approach in investigating European citizenship. I take up a particular European institution, the Dublin Regulations, which governs asylum in Europe {{in the context of}} the refugee crisis since 2015. I show that the criteria established by Dublin Regulations for determining the <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>responsible</b> for an asylum application prevent asylum seekers from having a role in overcoming their predicament. Moreover, I show that the proposals for reforming the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) as a response to the crises such as the refugee quota system are also prone to the same problem. As a remedy, I offer a novel proposal to reform the CEAS in a way that enhances their agency. In the following sections, after a description of the current European legislation on asylum policies elaborated by EU institutions to face the crisis, the chapter will present and discuss the issues present in the CEAS and in the Dublin System. In the last sections, claiming the necessity of approaching to the problem by considering it also from the refugees’ standpoint and, I will propose to fill the encountered gaps by enlarging the set of rights granted to refugees with several rights classically attached to the concept of citizenship. The chapter will show how enabling refugees to enjoy a limited set of rights, jointly with a greater harmonisation of the laws and practices at European level, could help to improve significantly both Member States’ and refugees’ wellbeing...|$|E

30|$|The European Commission Directorate General Migration and Home Affairs is {{in charge}} for {{developing}} EU policies on asylum. Since 1999, the EU has worked towards creating a common European asylum regime {{in accordance with the}} Geneva Convention and other international instruments. Between 2011 and 2013, the EU agreed on four main legal instruments on asylum. The latest one, the Dublin Regulation (EU) 604 / 201322 established the criteria and mechanisms for determining the <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>responsible</b> for examining an application for international protection in one of the Member States by a third-country national or stateless person. This system collapsed and is now under recreation. The transfer of competences in asylum policy from Member States to the European Union, despite guided by the goal to improve and harmonize diverse standards, has resulted in an uneven sharing of responsibilities for asylum seekers between Member States and a deterioration in guarantees of fundamental refugee rights. Already before 2014 the entire asylum system in the European Union was interpreted as dysfunctional and of questionable conformity with the 1951 Geneva Convention. 23 Whether the EU was able to better harmonise flight and migration standards looked already bleach before the crisis fully materialized. 24 At the core of EU’s refugee and asylum policy stands the Dublin Regulation. 25 Refugees have to be registered in the country where they first set their feet. Naturally, this will more often happen in the Southern periphery of the EU than in land-locked Austria surrounded by EU members. This system therefore put middle European countries in a more comfortable position. However, around autumn 2015, this system collapsed when tens of thousands of refugees streamed over the Balkan through Hungary. Before, Hungary was one of the countries that received the most asylum claims in relation to population size.|$|E
40|$|This article aims {{to uncover}} the legal {{background}} behind the European Union’s response to the ongoing refugee crisis. Pursuant to its Agenda on Migration, the EU has implemented a wide set of legal, financial and operative measures to face {{the challenges of the}} mass inflows of refugees onto its territory. Some of these measures aim to respond to what was classified as the most pressing duty of saving lives in the Mediterranean and strengthening EU external borders. Others aim to uphold the EU’s international obligations and values by assisting the third countries most affected. A core set of measures was then introduced to repair the existing EU legal framework on asylum, proven as dysfunctional when faced with the unprecedented pressures of incoming refugees. These measures came about {{in the context of an}} already deficient Common European Asylum System, yet the Union still decided to place the Dublin Regulation as a starting point for all operative plans dealing with the refugee crisis within the Union territory. Although the Dublin Regulation was not envisaged to function in a time of crisis, all the EU measures introduced were in effect merely exceptions to that inherently inefficient system. On the other hand, a true emergency mechanism was not something the Union lacked during the crucial moments of creating an operative plan for the Agenda. The existing Union framework on asylum creates two quite different concepts for determining the <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>responsible</b> for providing international protection to refugees – one for regular asylum procedures, and another for emergency situations. By choosing the former instead of the latter, the EU went for the wrong option. The author’s position is that the Union in its centralised capacity failed to activate an efficient legal framework to respond to a crisis of the present magnitude, thus creating a perfect ground for individual Member States to become the main actors of crisis management, each invoking its own political particularities and national interests. The outcome was polarisation of the Member States, every day moving farther away from the ever-closer Union...|$|E
40|$|Article 6 of the Treaty of the European Union (TEU) {{as part of}} the 2009 Treaty of Lisbon {{states that}} the European Union recognizes the rights, freedoms and {{principles}} set out in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. It also states fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). So, the fundamental rights system of the European Union consists of the constitutional traditions of the Member States of the Union, the rights of the ECHR and the obligatory provisions of the EU Charter. The ECJ refers to these three sources of law, while the ECtHR refers to the ECHR. Both, the ECJ and the ECtHR give judgments in cases concerning asylum and violation of human rights based on the European Union Regulation (EC) no. 343 / 2003, the so-called Dublin II Regulation determining the <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>responsible</b> for examining an asylum application, and reviewing compliance with the criteria for determining responsibility for examining the asylum application and the shortcomings of human rights protection. In the Abdullah case before the ECJ applicant was a Somali national who entered Greece irregularly by boat via Syria and Turkey and without having lodged an asylum application in Greece she travelled to Austria and applied for asylum. She did not apply for asylum in Greece due to deficiencies in the Greek asylum system. The ECJ held that once a Member State takes charge of an application {{on the basis of the}} Dublin II Regulation can only be overturned if there are systemic deficiencies in the asylum procedure. She was not able to call into question the conditions for the reception of applicants for asylum in Greece and lost the case. In the Tarakhel case versus Switzerland before the ECtHR applicants claimed the violation of Article 3 of the ECHR that prohibits torture and "inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. " The ECtHR thought that in cases of a family with young children being deported to Italy, suggest that the State normally undertakes a thorough examination of the individual situation. This had not be done and applicants were admissible. It is obvious that the European Union does not provide for an effective remedy for the applicant who neglects the Dublin II system for asylum seekers...|$|E
