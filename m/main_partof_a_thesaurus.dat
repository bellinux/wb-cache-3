To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes a new method for extending <b>a</b> <b>thesaurus</b> by adding taxonomic information automatically extracted from an MRD.

This framework can easily scale to any language with <b>a</b> <b>thesaurus</b> and <b>a</b> unzipped corpus size ≥ 50 GB (12 billion tokens).

Additionally, <b>a</b> <b>thesaurus</b> is used for maintaining a hierarchical listing of terms; usually single words or bound phrases that aid the indexer in narrowing the terms and limiting semantic ambiguity.|$|R

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and lexical transfer in Machine Translation (MT), the representation of word meanings is one critical issue. The conceptual vector model aims at representing thematic activations for chunks of text, lexical entries, up to whole documents. Roughly speaking, vectors are supposed to encode ideas associated to words or expressions. In this paper, we first expose the conceptual vectors model and the notions of semantic distance and contextualization between terms. Then, we present in details the text analysis process coupled with conceptual vectors, which is used in text classification, thematic analysis and vector learning. The question we focus on is whether <b>a</b> <b>thesaurus</b> is really needed and desirable for bootstrapping the learning. We conducted two experiments with and without <b>a</b> <b>thesaurus</b> and are exposing here some comparative results. Our contribution is that dimension distribution is done more regularly by an emergent procedure. In other words, the resources are more efficiently exploited with an emergent procedure than with <b>a</b> <b>thesaurus</b> terms (concepts) as listed in <b>a</b> <b>thesaurus</b> somehow relate to their importance in the language but not to their frequency in usage nor to their power of discrimination or representativeness. 1...|$|R
