Another of the company's products is the Thigpen Rotary Woofer. Typical subwoofer products are inefficient at producing desired sound pressure levels at frequencies below 20 Hz, but the TRW is designed to cover the range down to 1 Hz of the sound spectrum. (The technical principle would allow even zero Hz.) ...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe use of vector sensors in sonar receiving array applications {{is an area}} of active investigation by the U. S. Navy. A vector sensor combines the outputs of a monopolar (pressure) sensor co-located with one or more orthogonal dipolar (velocity or, more commonly, pressure-gradient) sensors to achieve a modest (5 – 6 dB) amount of directivity at a single point. The directivity of an array formed using such sensors is also modestly improved by the same amount. More importantly, though, the azimuthal angle ambiguity that occurs in the beam pattern of a line array of point pressure sensors is removed by employing vector sensors instead. This thesis describes an investigation into the underwater use of a pressure-gradient transducer technology that has been employed in airborne acoustic applications for many years (mostly as a source), but, to our knowledge, has heretofore never been employed under water. The devices examined include planar-magnetic and true ribbon transducers. The planar-magnetic transducer is very closely related to what was developed first (i. e., the true magnetic ribbon transducer). The same as an ordinary <b>magnetic</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> or microphone, both the planar-magnetic and true ribbon transducers employ a mutually orthogonal electrical conductor, magnetic field, and axis of motion of a diaphragm. We present the results of measurements made both in air and water of the transmitting and receiving responses of a planar-magnetic and a true ribbon transducer. We also present a procedure for the free-field reciprocity calibration of a pressure-gradient transducer. Lieutenant Commander, Korean NavyLieutenant Commander, Chilean Nav...|$|E

40|$|Click-evoked otoacoustic {{emissions}} {{from the human}} ear are typically several orders of magnitude smaller than the stimuli that elicit them—a measurement technique that attempts to cancel the stimulus signal from the recorded waveform is therefore typically employed. In practice, an imperfect cancellation of the stimulus is achieved, leaving a "stimulus artifact" that obscures {{the early part of}} the emission. Input-output nonlinearities of the transducers used in recording emissions are acknowledged as one source of the stimulus artifact. Here an additional source of this artifact, related to hysteresis in the <b>magnetic</b> "receivers" (<b>loudspeakers)</b> used in such recordings, is identified and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an analytical model for calculating {{the shape and}} the radial stiffness of ferrofluid seals used as radial bearings and this theoretical value of the radial stiffness is compared to measured values. This approach is interesting {{for the design of}} loudspeakers. Moreover, the concept of magnetic pressure is used to determine the seal shape as well as its energy. This paper corresponds to the case in which the ferrofluid seal is submitted to a high magnetic field. Furthermore, the calculation of the seal shape when the moving part is decentred is discussed. Indeed, the variation of the seal energy is evaluated with a three-dimensional analytical approach and both the restoring force exerted by the seal and the radial stiffness are calculated. The results obtained with an experimental setting confirm the validity of the model.
