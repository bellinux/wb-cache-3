40|$|The North Atlantic meridional {{overturning}} 6 circulation (MOC) {{is believed}} {{to play an important}} role in regulating the Earth’s climate. Yet, there is still much uncertainty regarding the dynamics of the MOC and its variability. It is well established, however, that, through geostrophy, the zonally integrated <b>meridional</b> <b>transport</b> at a particular latitude and depth can be determined from the east-west bottom pressure difference across the basin. Therefore, rather than consider the MOC as a large-scale system, this paper focuses on the dynamics of this geostrophic relationship in two numerical ocean models at a single latitude (50 ◦ 14 N) in the sub-polar Atlantic. First, it is shown that the bottom pressure on the western boundary is sufficient to recover, with high fidelity, the interannual <b>meridional</b> <b>transport</b> variability at 50 ◦ 17 N over a one hundred year period in the climate model HadCM 3. It is found that the variability of western boundary pressure is closely associated with density changes over the continental slope. These changes lead to a large zonal gradient in potential energy and an unfeasible, depth-mean velocity over the slope. The western boundary pressure, from which the <b>meridional</b> <b>transport</b> can be recovered, is generated as a compensation to this, and limits the depth-mean flow. This demonstrates that in numerical ocean models, at least, <b>meridional</b> <b>transport</b> variability is generated as a local response to density changes on the western slope. Whether this is a true representation of actual ocean variability is uncertain, but if it were, then <b>meridional</b> <b>transport</b> variability could largely be determined using only the density field on the western slope...|$|E

All products employ the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Oceans model, and the ORAs share very similar configurations. The ORA basin interior transports are consistently modified relative to the FRMs, especially in the Argo period, with an improved representation of the south equatorial currents. The ORAs also exhibit systematically higher <b>meridional</b> <b>transports</b> than the FRMs, in closer agreement with large-scale observational estimates at 35 ˚S and western boundary measurements at 11 ˚S. However, the transport impacts by data assimilation still greatly vary between the ORAs, leading to differences up to ~ 8 Sv and 0. 4 PW in the South Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and the <b>Meridional</b> Heat <b>Transports</b> (MHTs), respectively. Large inter-product discrepancies arise in the ORA western boundary currents at both upper and deep levels explaining up to ~ 85 % of the inter-product differences in their total MHTs, and meridional velocity differences, rather than temperatures differences, drive ~ 83 % of this spread. Further analysis shows that only very confined temperature differences right against the western boundary geostrophically explain the large boundary current velocity differences.

The ocean component is the idealized global general circulation model used in Part I. The atmospheric model assumes fixed latitudinal structure of the heat and moisture transports, and the amplitudes are calculated separately for each hemisphere from the large-scale sea surface temperature (SST) and SST gradient, using parameterizations based on baroclinic stability theory. The ocean-atmosphere heat and freshwater exchanges are calculated as residuals of the steady-state atmospheric budgets. Owing to the ocean component's weak heat transport, the model has too strong a meridional SST gradient when driven with observed atmospheric <b>meridional</b> <b>transports,</b> When the latter are made interactive, the conveyor belt circulation collapses. A Bur adjustment is introduced in which the efficiency of the atmospheric transports is lowered to match the too low efficiency of the ocean component. The feedbacks between the THC and both the atmospheric heat and moisture transports are positive, whether atmospheric transports are interactive in the Northern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere, or both. However, the feedbacks operate differently in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, because the Pacific THC dominates in the Southern Hemisphere, and deep water formation in the two hemispheres is negatively correlated. The feedbacks in the two hemispheres do nor necessarily reinforce each other because they have opposite effects on low-latitude temperatures.

40|$|International audienceThe <b>meridional</b> <b>transport</b> of salt is {{computed}} in {{a global}} eddy-resolving numerical model (1 / 12 ° resolution) {{in order to improve}} our understanding of the ocean salinity budget. A methodology is proposed that allows a global analysis of the salinity balance in relation to surface water fluxes, without defining a "freshwater anomaly" based on an arbitrary reference salinity. The method consists of a decomposition of the <b>meridional</b> <b>transport</b> into (i) the transport by the time–longitude–depth mean velocity, (ii) time–mean velocity recirculations and (iii) transient eddy perturbations. Water is added (rainfall and rivers) or removed (evaporation) at the ocean surface at different latitudes, which creates convergences and divergences of mass transport with maximum and minimum values close to ± 1 Sv. The resulting meridional velocity effects a net transport of salt at each latitude (± 30 Sv PSU), which is balanced by the time–mean recirculations and by the net effect of eddy salinity–velocity correlations. This balance ensures that the total <b>meridional</b> <b>transport</b> of salt is close to zero, a necessary condition for maintaining a quasi-stationary salinity distribution. Our model confirms that the eddy salt transport cannot be neglected: it is comparable to the transport by the time–mean recirculation (up to 15 Sv PSU) at the poleward and equatorial boundaries of the subtropical gyres. Two different mechanisms are found: eddy contributions are localized in intense currents such as the Kuroshio at the poleward boundary of the subtropical gyres, while they are distributed across the basins at the equatorward boundaries. Closer to the Equator, salinity–velocity correlations are mainly due to the seasonal cycle and large-scale perturbations such as tropical instability waves...|$|E

There are two processes responsible for this observation. In the corona, the plasma beta is much less than 1, except directly above streamers, so both longitudinal and latitudinal (meridional) gradients in field strength will relax, due to the transverse magnetic pressure gradient force, as the solar wind carries magnetic flux away from the Sun. This happens so quickly that the field is essentially uniform by 5 solar radius. Beyond 10 solar radius, beta is greater than 1 and it is possible for a meridional thermal pressure gradient to redistribute magnetic flux - an effect apparently absent in Ulysses and earlier ICE and Interplanetary Magnetic Physics (IMP) data. We discuss this second effect here, showing that its absence is mainly due to the perpendicular part of the anisotropic thermal pressure gradient in the interplanetary medium being too small to drive significant <b>meridional</b> <b>transport</b> between the Sun and approx. 4 AU.

The first forcing corresponds to homogeneously intensified winds, while the second concerns their poleward intensification, consistent with positive phases of the SAM. Resulting wind-driven responses differ greatly between the nearly insensitive Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and the more sensitive meridional overturning circulation (MOC). As expected, eddies mitigate the response of the ACC and MOC to poleward-intensified winds. However, transient eddies do not necessarily play an increasing role in <b>meridional</b> <b>transport</b> with increasing resolution.

To diagnose this variability, we made a global anthropogenic CO 2 simulation using an eddy-permitting version of the coupled ocean sea-ice model ORCA-LIM. As for heat transport, the seasonally varying transport of anthropogenic CO 2 is largest within 20 ° of the equator and shows secondary maxima in the subtropics. Ekman transport generally drives most of the seasonal variability, but the contribution of the vertical shear becomes important near the equator and in the Southern Ocean. Mesoscale variabilty contributes to the annual-mean transport of both heat and anthropogenic CO 2 with strong poleward transport in the Southern Ocean and equatorward transport in the tropics. This "rectified" eddy transport is largely baroclinic in the tropics and barotropic in the Southern Ocean due to a larger contribution from standing eddies. Our analysis revealed that most previous hydrographic estimates of <b>meridional</b> <b>transport</b> of anthropogenic CO 2 are severely biased because they neglect temporal fluctuations due to non-Ekman velocity variations.
