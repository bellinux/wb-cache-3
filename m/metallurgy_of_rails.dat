40|$|The {{physical}} <b>metallurgy</b> <b>of</b> near-solidus integranular cracking in Inconel 718 welds was investigated. The data, although inconclusive, suggest {{at least}} two mechanisms which might explain intergranular cracking (microfissuring) in the heat-affected zone of several high temperature alloys. One theory {{is based on the}} separation of intergranular liquid while the other involves mechanical failure of solid ligaments surrounded by intergranular liquid. Both mechanisms concentrate strain in the grain boundaries resulting in low strain (1 %) intergranular brittleness. The mechanisms reported might also pertain to the physical <b>metallurgy</b> <b>of</b> casting, powder <b>metallurgy</b> sintering and hot isostatic pressing...|$|R
