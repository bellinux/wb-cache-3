5|$|A {{preparation}} of L-ornithine and L-aspartate (LOLA) {{is used to}} increase the generation of urea through the urea cycle, a metabolic pathway that removes ammonia by turning it into the neutral substance urea. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> with lactulose and/or rifaximin if these alone are ineffective at controlling symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Earth usually {{requires}} {{some sort of}} processing for use in construction. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> with water to make mud, straw may be added, some form of stabilizing material such as lime or cement {{may be used to}} harden the earth, and the earth may be compacted to increase strength.|$|E
5|$|Shorter and quicker {{routes to}} the top of Helvellyn, though with less {{attractive}} scenery, begin from several points along the A591 road along {{the west side of the}} mountain. Two of these <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> to create a circular walk. Incorporating the south ridge in the route can restore much of the scenic interest.|$|E

5|$|Chemotherapy <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> with {{palliative care}} in the {{treatment}} of the NSCLC. In advanced cases, appropriate chemotherapy improves average survival over supportive care alone, as well as improving quality of life. With adequate physical fitness maintaining chemotherapy during lung cancer palliation offers 1.5 to 3 months of prolongation of survival, symptomatic relief, and an improvement in quality of life, with better results seen with modern agents. The NSCLC Meta-Analyses Collaborative Group recommends if the recipient wants and can tolerate treatment, then chemotherapy should be considered in advanced NSCLC.|$|E
5|$|Emissions {{of bonds}} are backed by {{guarantees}} {{given by the}} euro area member states in proportion to their share in the paid-up capital of the European Central Bank. The €440 billion lending capacity of the facility is jointly and severally guaranteed by the eurozone countries' governments and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> with loans up to €60 billion from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (reliant on funds raised by the European Commission using the EU budget as collateral) and up to €250 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to obtain a financial safety net up to €750 billion.|$|E
5|$|The game {{contains}} {{three types}} of clouds: white clouds, which follow the avatar; gray, neutral clouds, which become white when touched; and black clouds, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> with white clouds to cause rain, dissolving both clouds. A large number of white clouds more easily dissolves {{a small number of}} dark clouds than an equal number, and vice versa. White clouds stop following the avatar if the player moves too quickly and they resume following if approached again. Each of the four missions in Cloud has a different objective, including forming patterns in the sky with clouds, eliminating black clouds, and creating rain over each of the islands.|$|E

5|$|Beneath a Steel Sky is a 2D {{adventure}} {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. The player uses a point-and-click interface {{to interact with}} the environment and to guide protagonist Robert Foster through the game's world. To solve puzzles and progress in the game, the player collects items that <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> with one another, used on the environment, or given to non-player characters (NPCs). The protagonist converses with NPCs via dialogue trees to learn about the game's puzzles and plot. Clues and other information are obtained by clicking on items in the inventory and on objects in the environment. Unlike in most adventure games at the time, the protagonist's death is possible, after which the player starts from the last save point. In the remastered iOS version, the point-and-click interface is replaced with a touch user interface, a hint system is added, and hotspots are highlighted.|$|E
5|$|When lasers {{were first}} invented, laser speckle was {{considered}} to be a severe drawback in using lasers to illuminate objects, particularly in holographic imaging because of the grainy image produced. It was later realized that speckle patterns could carry information about the object's surface deformations. Butters and Leendertz developed the technique of speckle pattern interferometry in 1970, and since then, speckle has been exploited in a variety of other applications. A photograph is made of the speckle pattern before deformation, and a second photograph is made of the speckle pattern after deformation. Digital subtraction of the two images results in a correlation fringe pattern, where the fringes represent lines of equal deformation. Short laser pulses in the nanosecond range can be used to capture very fast transient events. A phase problem exists: In the absence of other information, one cannot tell the difference between contour lines indicating a peak versus contour lines indicating a trough. To resolve the issue of phase ambiguity, ESPI <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> with phase shifting methods.|$|E

25|$|A marked {{increase}} in fatigability, or asthenia, is often prominent. This increased weariness <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>combined</b> with hyperactivity; patients remark {{that they are}} impelled to incessant activity, which, however, causes great fatigue.|$|E
