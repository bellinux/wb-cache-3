2500|$|After the {{helicopter}} demonstrated its early battlefield capabilities in the Korean War, the United States Army began experimenting with expanded roles and missions for them. This culminated in 1962 with {{the formation of}} the Tactical Mobility Requirements Board, which strongly recommended the adaptation of helicopters in a variety of roles and missions. In 1963, the 11th Air Assault Division was activated to test a number of the Board's concepts and recommendations about air mobility. Because the 155mm howitzers then assigned to Army divisions as <b>medium</b> <b>support</b> artillery were not transportable by helicopters, the concept of aerial rocket artillery (ARA) was developed as a substitute. [...] The original test unit for rocket-armed helicopters within the 11th Air Assault Division was the 2nd Battalion, 42nd Artillery (later designated the 3rd Battalion, 377th Artillery). When the 11th Air Assault was redesignated as the 1st Cavalry Division and sent to Vietnam, the 3/377th became the 2nd Battalion, 20th Artillery (using the radio call sign [...] "Blue Max"). This was the first unit designated and organized as ARA to take part in combat operations. The 4/77th Artillery joined the 101st Airborne Division in 1969 when the 101st was converted to an airmobile division, becoming the second active ARA battalion. Battery F, 79th Artillery, was formed to serve with the separate 3d Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division {{when the rest of the}} division was withdrawn from Vietnam. It was the final ARA unit to see combat service.|$|E

We study the asymptotic development of the wave field as the mass density ρ → + ∞ and show that the wave field inside D will decay exponentially while the wave filed outside the medium will converge to the one corresponding to a sound-hard obstacle D buried in the <b>medium</b> <b>supported</b> in. Moreover, the normal velocity of the wave field on ∂ D from outside D is shown to be vanishing as ρ → +∞. We derive very accurate estimates for the wave field inside and outside D and on ∂ D in terms of ρ, and show that the asymptotic estimates are sharp. The implication of the obtained results is given for an inverse scattering problem of reconstructing a complex scatterer...|$|R
