2500|$|An anembryonic {{pregnancy}} (also {{called an}} [...] "empty sac" [...] or [...] "blighted ovum") {{is a condition}} where the gestational sac develops normally, while the embryonic part of the pregnancy is either absent or stops growing very early. This accounts for approximately half of <b>miscarriages.</b> All other <b>miscarriages</b> are classified as embryonic <b>miscarriages,</b> meaning {{that there is an}} embryo present in the gestational sac. Half of embryonic <b>miscarriages</b> have aneuploidy (an abnormal number of chromosomes).|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of uterine anatomical abnormalities found by office diagnostic hysteroscopy in a population of patients experiencing more than two consecutive <b>miscarriages</b> and compare {{the prevalence of}} uterine abnormalities between patients with two <b>miscarriages</b> and those with three or more consecutive <b>miscarriages.</b> MethodsA cross-sectional study of 66 patients with two or more consecutive <b>miscarriages</b> diagnosis was conducted. Patients {{were divided into two}} groups: Group A (up to two <b>miscarriages,</b> 23 patients), and Group B (3 <b>miscarriages,</b> 43 patients). They underwent an outpatient diagnostic hysteroscopy study, with either congenital or acquired abnormalities of the uterine cavity being identified. ResultsUterine changes were found in 22 (33. 3 %) patients, with 9 cases of congenital changes [arcuate uterus (4 cases), septate uterus (2 cases), and bicornuate uterus (1 case) ], and 13 patients with acquired changes [intrauterine adhesions (7 cases), endometrial polyp (4 cases), and uterine leiomyoma (2 cases) ]. No {{significant differences were found between}} the groups as regarding both acquired and congenital uterine changes. A positive correlation was found between anatomical changes on hysteroscopy and number of <b>miscarriages</b> (r= 0. 31; p= 0. 02). ConclusionPatients with more than two <b>miscarriages</b> have a high prevalence of uterine cavity abnormalities diagnosed by hysteroscopy; however there are no differences in prevalence or distribution of these lesions related to the number of recurrent <b>miscarriages...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim is {{to stress}} the {{importance}} of prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis in gravidas with high levels of anticardiolipin antibodies with or without a history of repetitive <b>miscarriages.</b> The evolutions of two gravidas who were treated in pre-natal and vascular surgery outpatients’ clinics and who suffered from deep venous thrombosis, <b>miscarriages</b> and high anticardiolipin antibody levels are reported. The gestations terminated at full term after prophylaxis for <b>miscarriages</b> was applied. The report suggests that patients with deep venous thrombosis and high anticardiolipin antibody levels may present with <b>miscarriages</b> and, therefore, prophylactic treatment is recommended...|$|R
5000|$|Summa Iniuria: Ein Pitaval der Justizirrtümer (Summa Iniuria: A Pitaval of <b>Miscarriages</b> of Justice) is a {{collection}} of causes célèbres by the Swiss author Hans M. Sutermeister. It is considered “one of the most detailed documentations about <b>miscarriages</b> of justice in the German language”. [...] It is inspired by Voltaire′s early activism against French <b>miscarriages</b> of justice of puritan origin, as well as by Arthur Conan Doyle′s criminalistic approaches.|$|R
50|$|<b>Miscarriages</b> {{may be more}} {{prevalent}} in patients with a lupus anticoagulant. Some of these <b>miscarriages</b> may potentially be prevented with the administration of aspirin and unfractionated heparin. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews provide a deeper understanding on the subject.|$|R
5|$|Birth control also {{improves}} child {{survival in}} the developing world by lengthening the time between pregnancies. In this population, outcomes are worse when a mother gets pregnant within eighteen months of a previous delivery. Delaying another pregnancy after a <b>miscarriage</b> however does not appear to alter risk and women are advised to attempt pregnancy in this situation whenever they are ready.|$|E

5|$|Determination of TPO {{antibodies}} may {{be considered}} {{as part of the}} assessment of recurrent <b>miscarriage,</b> as subtle thyroid dysfunction can be associated with pregnancy loss, but this recommendation is not universal, and presence of thyroid antibodies may not predict future outcome.|$|E
2500|$|Chromosomal {{abnormalities}} {{are found}} {{in more than half}} of embryos miscarried in the first 13 weeks. Half of embryonic <b>miscarriages</b> (25% of all <b>miscarriages)</b> have an aneuploidy (abnormal number of chromosomes). [...] Common chromosome abnormalities found in <b>miscarriages</b> include autosomal trisomy (22-32%), monosomy X (5-20%), triploidy (6-8%), tetraploidy (2-4%), or other structural chromosomal abnormalities (2%). Genetic problems are more likely to occur with older parents; this may account for the higher rates observed in older women.|$|R
40|$|Data {{from the}} Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES) {{were used to}} examine a profile of social, medical, and {{behavioral}} characteristics associated with low birth-weight (LBW) and <b>miscarriages</b> in first and second generation Hispanics of Mexican descent. The percentage of LBW was 5. 3 and of <b>miscarriages</b> was 12. 7. LBW rates were higher for second generation primipara and multipara compared with first generation women. Using multivariate logistic regression techniques and adjusting for complex design effects, generation {{was found to be}} a significant predictor of LBW but not of <b>miscarriages.</b> The findings support existing evidence that a Mexican cultural orientation protects first generation. Mexico-born women against a risk for LBW. However, the findings do not show significant effects of generation on <b>miscarriages,</b> suggesting that cultural effects are not consistent for all pregnancy outcomes. Furthermore, we suggest that the higher rates of LBW in second generation women are not due to a higher rate of <b>miscarriages</b> as has been hypothesized...|$|R

5|$|In addition, in at-risk pregnancies {{due to an}} {{affected}} male partner, non-invasive {{prenatal diagnosis}} can be performed by analyzing cell-free fetal DNA in a blood sample taken from the mother (via venipuncture) between six and twelve weeks of pregnancy.

5|$|A {{pregnant}} woman's elevated {{blood lead}} level can lead to <b>miscarriage,</b> prematurity, low birth weight, and problems with development during childhood.

A fetus may be poisoned in utero if lead from the mother's bones is subsequently mobilized by the changes in metabolism due to pregnancy; increased calcium intake in pregnancy may help mitigate this phenomenon.|$|E

50|$|Skewed X {{chromosome}} inactivation {{has been}} implicated in <b>miscarriages</b> in the past. Recurrent pregnancy loss {{can be defined as}} either two or three consecutive lost pregnancies within five months. In most cases the loss of pregnancy can be attributed to cytogenic, hormonal, anatomical, and immunological problems. However, there are still about 50% of cases without a known cause. A study hypothesized that skewed X inactivation {{may play a role in}} these <b>miscarriages.</b> However, recent research has criticized this correlation due to the lack of controlling for age related skewing. There is a lack of significant correlation between <b>miscarriages</b> and skewed inactivation, with only 6.6% of the patients showing significant skewing as compared to the 3.9% rate in the control group. It is unlikely for skewed X inactivation to influence recurrent <b>miscarriages.</b>|$|R
