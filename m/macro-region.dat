5|$|Croatia is {{traditionally}} divided into numerous, often overlapping geographic regions, whose borders {{are not always}} clearly defined. The largest and most readily recognizable ones throughout the country are Central Croatia (also described as the Zagreb <b>macro-region),</b> Eastern Croatia (largely corresponding with Slavonia), and Mountainous Croatia (Lika and Gorski Kotar; {{to the west of}} Central Croatia). These three comprise the inland or continental part of Croatia. Coastal Croatia consists of a further two regions: Dalmatia or the southern littoral, between the general area of the city of Zadar and the southernmost tip of the country; and the northern littoral located north of Dalmatia, encompassing the Croatian Littoral and Istria. The geographical regions generally do not conform to county boundaries or other administrative divisions, and all of them encompass further, more specific, geographic regions.|$|E

The following achievements have been accomplished along the project development: 1) comprehensive description of the study selected PGaE, 2) quantification of the selected agricultural PGaE using agri-environmental indicators, 3) standardised description of PGaE disentangling the macro-regional agro-ecological infra-structures from its ecological and cultural services, 4) delimitation of wide areas with homogeneous agro-ecological infra-structures across EU (<b>macro-regions),</b> 5) delimitation of the <b>macro-regions,</b> independently from their supply of PGaE, 6) definition of “Macro-Regional Agri-Environmental Problems” (MRAEP), through the association of the <b>macro-regions</b> with the core PGaE supplied by them, delivering non-market demand-side valuation problems relevant to the agricultural and agri-environmental policy decision-makers, 7) design of a Choice Modelling (CM) survey able to gather multi-country value estimates of changes in the provision level of different PGaE supplied by different <b>macro-regions,</b> 8) successful testing of the valuation framework through a pilot survey and 9) delivering of alternative sampling plans for the EU level large-scale survey allowing for different options regarding the number of surveyed countries, the size and composition of respective samples, and the survey administration-mode, balanced with estimates for the corresponding budgetary cost.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the levels}} and trends of regional disparity and convergence {{in the two}} American <b>macro-regions,</b> NAFTA and MERCOSUR. In the case of NAFTA, 95 micro-regions were analysed (12 in Canada; 32 in Mexico; 51 states in the US). In MERCOSUR, the regions are represented by four countries (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay). The analysis covers the period 2000 – 2008 (or rather 2000 to 2005 for Mexico). The regional disparities were calculated with the Gini coefficient based on nominal GDP, GDP per capita and GDP per capita PPS. Convergence analysis {{was done with the}} Disparity Range Coefficient (DRC), the Average Disparity Range Coefficient (ADRC), σ- convergence and β-convergence. The results of regional disparity were as follows. Based on the nominal GDP, it was at high levels in both <b>macro-regions,</b> with a Gini coefficient above 0. 55. With the disparities calculated on GDP per capita, the level of regional disparity in both <b>macro-regions</b> was lower at 0. 36 in NAFTA and 0. 28 in MERCOSUR in 2000. Based on GDP per capita in PPP, the levels were lower than based on the GDP per capita analysis starting at 0. 31 in NAFTA and 0. 16 in MERCOSUR. The disparities further decreased by half in NAFTA while slightly increasing in MERSCOSUR. The convergence analysis results based on the DRC analysis showed that neither NAFTA nor MERCOSUR regions converged. The speed of divergence varied significantly. The disparities among the richest and poorest regions in GDP per capita increased 6. 26 times more than the average GDP per capita in PPP in NAFTA as a whole. It was only 0. 52 in MERCOSUR. The ADRC analysis also resulted in divergence trends for both <b>macro-regions</b> but with lower rates. Convergence calculated with the σ- convergence analysis confirmed that both <b>macro-regions</b> diverged. The divergence rate for NAFTA was 1. 41 % and for MERCOSUR 0. 74. Calculated with the β-convergence analysis, the NAFTA region showed a status quo (convergence of 0. 01 %) and a divergence trend was registered for MERCOSUR (0. 99 %). At the country level, the micro-regions in Canada were diverging (1. 62 % per year) while the ones in the US and Mexico converging (0. 02 % and 0. 77 %, respectively) ...|$|R

A pooled ordinary least squares model (POLS) is employed using a panel dataset at the provincial level. Variations in economic openness (government's preferential policies) and industrial and economic development in terms of market size, human resources, agglomeration and infrastructure are the prime causes of the uneven regional distribution of FDI, which further widens income and economic development inequalities among the three <b>macro-regions.</b> To reduce the degree of regional disparity, the government should offer more extensive preferential policies attracting FDI, especially in energy, transport, resources, high and new technology industries, into the inland regions and increase government investment in education and infrastructure in these areas. ...|$|R

We use an indicator of education-job (mis) matching drawn and adapted from the literature, and apply both ordered logit and probit models with self-selection to a dataset on graduates’ entry in the labour market produced by the Italian National Statistical Institute. Our results suggest that, in line with most previous studies, interregional migration contributes to reduce education-job gaps: however, we find that the analysis for Italy as a whole masks stark differences between <b>macro-regions,</b> for which the typical North-South dualism still holds, confirming once more the cumulative and path-dependent nature of regional development trajectories...|$|R
