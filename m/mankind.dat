The match began when Carlito {{performed}} a dropkick on <b>Mankind.</b> However, <b>Mankind</b> got the advantage over Carlito. Midway through the match, <b>Mankind</b> tried to use a steel chair on Carlito, but Carlito avoided, executeing drop toe-hold, sending <b>Mankind</b> into the steel steps. <b>Mankind</b> rose to his feet, which led Carlito to perform a standing dropkick, resulting in <b>Mankind</b> to hit {{the back of his}} head into the steel steps. Back in the ring, <b>Mankind</b> received the upper hand after delivering a DDT and forced Carlito to submit with the Mandible claw and win the match.|$|E

5|$|The central {{image of}} The Dry Salvages is {{water and the}} sea. The images {{are similar to the}} Odyssey but {{represent}} internal aspects. Humanity loses itself to technology and theories like evolution that separate <b>mankind</b> philosophically from the past. According to Eliot, within each man there is a connection to all of <b>mankind.</b> If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave <b>mankind</b> hope that {{he will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation. Through Christ, we are able to overcome time unless we do not know him. Our corruption can be overcome and that we are able to join the eternal.|$|E

5|$|Eliot {{began writing}} The Dry Salvages {{at the end}} of 1940 during air-raids on London, and managed to finish the poem quickly. The poem {{included}} many personal images connecting to Eliot's childhood, and emphasised the image of water and sailing as a metaphor for humanity. According to the poem, there is a connection to all of <b>mankind</b> within each man. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave <b>mankind</b> hope that {{it will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past in order to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation.|$|E
5|$|Eliot invokes {{images of}} {{original}} sin and Adam's fall when talking about the past and points out that such events can be forgotten but can still affect <b>mankind.</b> Eliot brings {{in the image of}} Krishna to discuss how the past and future are related: Krishna, speaking to Arjuna, claims that death can come at any time and that men should always find the divine will instead of worrying about what their actions will bring. If an individual were to follow Krishna's words then {{they would be able to}} free their self from the limitations of time. Even if it cannot be fully attained, the effort in attempting it is still important. The way for <b>mankind</b> to understand the divine will is through prayer and through the power of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
5|$|Eliot {{started writing}} East Coker in 1939, and {{modelled}} the poem after Burnt Norton {{as a way}} to focus his thoughts. The poem served as a sort of opposite to the popular idea that The Waste Land served as an expression of disillusionment after World War I, though Eliot never accepted this interpretation. The poem focuses on life, death, and continuity between the two. Humans are seen as disorderly and science is viewed as unable to save <b>mankind</b> from its flaws. Instead, science and reason lead <b>mankind</b> to warfare, and humanity needs to become humble in order to escape the cycle of destruction. To be saved, people must recognize Christ as their savior as well as their need for redemption.|$|E
