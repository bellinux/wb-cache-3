This prevented African Americans from having a <b>meaningful</b> <b>vote</b> in the election. Without a Republican candidate, the Democratic Primary election acted as the Presidential election.|$|E
50|$|Best for Britain has {{launched}} what it claims is the UK's largest ever tactical voting campaign. Gina Miller, {{a director of}} Best for Britain, launched a crowdfunding appeal for a tactical voting initiative on 19 April 2017 in response to Theresa May's announcement of a snap election to be held on 8 June. The stated aim of this appeal is to support candidates {{who are opposed to}} an extreme Brexit, are committed to a <b>meaningful</b> <b>vote</b> on the eventual Brexit deal, and will be prepared to defend the interests of the British people and reject a deal that leaves Britain worse off. Thr crowdfunding campaign has received donations from more than 10,000 people, and raised over £350,000.|$|E
40|$|This report {{examines}} {{whether and}} how furthering Internet freedom can empower civil society vis-à-vis public officials, make the government more accountable to its citizens, and integrate citizens into the policymaking process. AbstractThe Internet has become a new battleground between governments that censor online content and those who advocate freedom to browse, post, and share information online for all, regardless of their place of residence. This report examines {{whether and how}} furthering Internet freedom can empower civil society vis-à-vis public officials, make the government more accountable to its citizens, and integrate citizens into the policymaking process. Using case studies of events in 2011 in Egypt, Syria, China, and Russia, researchers focus {{on the impact of}} Internet freedom on freedom of assembly, freedom of expression, and the right to cast a <b>meaningful</b> <b>vote,</b> all of which are the key pillars of political space. Researchers analyze the mechanisms by which Internet freedom can enhance the opportunities to enjoy these freedoms, how different political contexts can alter the opportunities for online mobilization, and how, subsequently, online activism can grow out into offline mobilization leading to visible policy changes. To provide historical context, researchers also draw parallels between the effects of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty programs in the Soviet Union during the Cold War and the ongoing efforts to expand Internet freedom for all. The report concludes by discussing implications for the design of Internet freedom programs and other measures to protect "freedom to connect. "Authored by Olesya Tkacheva, Lowell H. Schwartz, Martin C. Libicki, Julie E. Taylor, Jeffrey Martini, and Caroline Baxter...|$|E
50|$|Modern {{political}} science has questioned whether average citizens have sufficient political information to cast <b>meaningful</b> <b>votes.</b> A {{series of studies}} {{coming out of the}} University of Michigan in the 1950s and 1960s argued that voters lack a basic understanding of current issues, the liberal-conservative ideological dimension, and the relative ideological dilemma.|$|R
40|$|Intervals {{constitute}} one of {{the most}} important tools for dealing with uncertainty in computations. Researchers in the fields of interval arithmetic and constraint propagation have devised elaborate methods for computing with interval variables. In this interpretation, an interval represents the proposition: “I don’t know what the correct value is, but it cannot be outside this range. ” However, intervals also have another use, which is captured in the statement: “Any value in this range would be fine with me. ” In devising voting schemes for data fusion and fault-tolerant distributed computation, these two meanings, and a number of other lesser known variations, must be completely understood in order to design and implement <b>meaningful</b> <b>voting</b> strategies. Irregularities and paradoxes in voting schemes, extensively studied by mathematicians and social scientists, must also be taken into account to avoid serious pitfalls. In this paper, we discuss the two interpretations of interval voting, along with their practical implications, and show how voting strategies differ in their time and communication complexities, performance, and resilience according to the meaning intended and the types of failure assumed...|$|R
40|$|In voting systems where a mark in a fixed {{position}} may mean {{a vote for}} Alice on a ballot, and a vote for Bob on another ballot, an attacker may coerce voters to put their mark at a certain position, enforcing effectively a random vote. This attack is <b>meaningful</b> if the <b>voting</b> system allows to take receipts with them and/or posts them to a bulletin board. The coercer may also ask for a blank receipt. We analyze this kind of attack and prove that it requires the same effort as a comparable attack would require against any voting system, even one without receipts. ...|$|R
40|$|Although the 2008 presidential {{primaries}} were in {{many ways}} a resounding success in terms of turnout, attention, and sheer excitement, many noted the pressing need for reform. States were rushing to hold their primaries sooner than ever, giving rise to 2 ̆ 2 Super-Duper Tuesday, 2 ̆ 2 where twenty-four states had their primaries on the same day. The Democratic nominee at one point looked like it might be decided by the votes of so-called 2 ̆ 2 Superdelegates 2 ̆ 2 -party regulars beholden to no one. As the Democratic nomination contest wore on, Rush Limbaugh, in 2 ̆ 2 Operation Chaos, 2 ̆ 2 encouraged his 2 ̆ 2 dittoheads 2 ̆ 2 to raid the party primaries of the Democrats, tilting the vote against Obama, the presumptive nominee. And there were continued grumblings about the disproportionate influence Iowa and New Hampshire had on the whole process. Fortunately, reform is in the air. The Democratic National Committee 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 Commission for Change 2 ̆ 2 has released its proposals for altering how the Democrats run their primaries. It is unclear how, if at all, the Republicans will follow suit. But how are we to evaluate such proposals? What do we want in a presidential primary? My Article, borrowing from the vital field of election law, proposes a set of values by which we should evaluate the presidential primaries. By investigating the various players in the nomination process-voters, parties, and the state-I isolate three major sets of 2 ̆ 2 constitutional values 2 ̆ 2 that are implicated in the presidential primary system: (1) the right of voters to an effective and <b>meaningful</b> <b>vote,</b> (2) the interests of the political parties in their autonomy and ideological purity (as well as in electoral victory), and (3) the concern of state and federal governments that the nomination process be legitimate, competitive, and produce a candidate who is capable of governing. Finally, I propose a master value-that of 2 ̆ 2 deliberation 2 ̆ 2 -that both explains and unifies the various competing values at play in the primaries. And I analyze the two major proposals for reforming the primaries, a national primary and a series of regional primaries, as well as the recommendations of the Democratic National Committee, in light of the goal of achieving 2 ̆ 2 deliberative primaries. 2 ̆ 2 Last question-and I 2 ̆ 7 m not sure if you even have a sense or if it 2 ̆ 7 s even appropriate to speculate-but do you think the new rules will favor a certain type of candidate? Does it favor a candidate who surges early like in the old Iowa and New Hampshire model, or a candidate who is strong regionally, or a candidate with wide but not deep support across the whole country? Rules do matter [...] ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{monotonicity}} criterion {{renders the}} intuition {{that there should}} be neither need to worry about harming a candidate by (nothing else than) up-ranking nor {{it should be possible to}} support a candidate by (nothing else than) counter-intuitively down-ranking. There are several variations of that criterion; e.g., what Douglas R. Woodall called mono-add-plump: A candidate [...] should not be harmed if further ballots are added that have [...] top with no second choice. Agreement with such rather special properties is the best any ranked voting system may fulfill: The Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem shows, that any <b>meaningful</b> ranked <b>voting</b> system is susceptible to some kind of tactical voting, and Arrow's impossibility theorem shows that individual rankings can't be meaningfully translated into a community-wide ranking where the order of candidates [...] and [...] is always independent of irrelevant alternatives [...] Noncompliance with the monotonicity criterion doesn't tell anything about the likelihood of monotonicity violations, failing in one of a million possible elections would be as well a violation as missing the criterion in any possible election.|$|R
40|$|This study aims at {{determining}} if online {{information may}} affect, in a <b>meaningful</b> way, the <b>voting</b> decisions of media audience. Three regression models were built {{to establish the}} level to which online channels of communication can create {{a significant impact on}} the behavioral decisions of the audience responding to electoral campaigns. All three models are with moderated effect. The goal of this research is to examine how such demographics as age, income, and level of education are more likely to moderate the ways online persuasive media information is being consumed by target voters. By analyzing these moderated relationships the applicability of a communication theory, the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), which focuses on the way persuasive communication is consumed, is actually being tested in the context of electoral campaigns...|$|R

We examined archival web records of candidate and youth engagement sites in the 2002 elections for the nature and frequency of appeals to young citizens on various issues, as well as interactive communication features that enable visitors to different sites to communicate and stay involved. The ways in which young citizens can travel within the youth sphere and across the two spheres are also examined through detailed analysis of site links, and {{the presence or absence of}} features on youth engagement sites that may help visitors search for campaigns that match their political preferences. The general findings suggest that there is much more that both campaigns and youth engagement organizations can do to attract young citizens and assist them in finding <b>meaningful</b> paths to <b>voting.</b> Campaigns still offer relatively few appeals directly to young voters, compared, for example, to appeals to senior citizens. And there are no links out from campaigns to the sphere of youth engagement sites, missing opportunities to connect voting to surrounding political experiences in society.

40|$|At {{the very}} heart of every {{political}} democracy is the right of citizens to participate in its democratic processes. The right to vote is the bedrock of a democratic polity and the essence of representative governance. No right is more precious than the right to have a voice in the election of those who make laws that govern us. All other rights, even the most basic, are illusory without a <b>meaningful</b> right to <b>vote.</b> While democracy is not synonymous with the right to vote, it is undeniable that there is little left of it when the right to vote itself is taken away. For “at the bottom of all tributes”, to borrow the matchless words of Sir Winston Churchill, “is the little man, walking into a little booth, with a little pencil, making a little cross on a little bit of paper [...] no amount of rhetoric or voluminous discussion can possibly diminish the overwhelming importance of the point”. This note is an analysis of the status of the right to vote under the Indian Constitution. The debate on the status of right to vote in India was presented with a novel dimension in the opinion of the Judge P. V. Reddi who in the recent case of Peoples Union for Civil Liberties v Union of India observed that the right to vote {{has its roots in the}} Indian Constitution and, therefore, is a constitutional right. Strange as it may seem to readers from other constitutional jurisdictions, this was the first occasion that such a judicial opinion has been expressed. For nearly five decades, the Indian Supreme Court had consistently held the view that the right to vote in India was a statutory right “pure and simple”...|$|R
