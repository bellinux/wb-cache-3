A piece of furniture worth noting would be the throne chair, which dates back {{to one of the}} earlier Khedives, maybe Ismail Pasha. Also, two portraits and a <b>mechanical</b> <b>singing</b> <b>bird</b> in a cage are present in this room. The singing bird is a Harem toy from Istanbul, and was brought by the founder’s brother.|$|E
5000|$|Serinette, a 'Festival opera' in two acts {{with music}} by Harry Somers and {{libretto}} by James Reaney, was commissioned {{with the support}} of the Canada Council and the Ontario Arts Council for the tenth season (1990) of Music at Sharon; it was designed specifically for production in the Temple. It premiered on 7 July 1990, and was broadcast on CBC radio's 'Saturday Afternoon at the Opera'. The production was conducted by Victor Feldbrill, directed by Keith Turnbull, and designed by Sue LePage. Reaney's libretto is based on an historical feud between the Ridout and Jarvis families in the 1830s, and the attraction of the fictitious central figure, Colin Jarvis ('younger brother' of the historical Samuel Jarvis) to the utopian community at Sharon. A central symbol is the [...] "serinette," [...] a <b>mechanical</b> <b>singing</b> <b>bird</b> imported from Europe. Each act began with the performers and audience processing into the building; the finale was performed inside the candle-lit Temple with the spectators observing from outside, in imitation of the original annual [...] "illumination" [...] of the Temple. The success of the opera led to the rebirth of the now annual tradition of a fall [...] "illumination." [...] The work calls for 14 singer-actors, and a 12-piece chamber orchestra.|$|E

50|$|The {{sixteenth century}} in Europe saw a renewed {{interest}} in Greek thought and philosophy, including the works of Hero of Alexandria about hydraulics and pneumatics. His devices, such as temple doors operated by invisible weights or flowing liquids, and <b>mechanical</b> <b>singing</b> <b>birds</b> powered by steam, motivated several European palaces to create similar clever devices to enhance their public image.|$|R
5000|$|The period 1860 to 1910 {{is known}} as [...] "The Golden Age of Automata". During this period many small family based {{companies}} of Automata makers thrived in Paris. From their workshops they exported thousands of clockwork automata and <b>mechanical</b> <b>singing</b> <b>birds</b> around the world. It is these French automata that are collected today, although now rare and expensive they attract collectors worldwide. The main French makers were Bontems, Lambert, Phalibois, Renou, Roullet & Decamps, Theroude and Vichy.|$|R

50|$|There {{were also}} other Rochats working in Geneva at the time. Among them is Louis Rochat, {{originally}} from l'Abbaye in the Vallée de Joux, {{who is considered}} to be the maker of a piece with clock and <b>singing</b> <b>birds</b> (today in the Peking Museum) which won a prize from the Genevan Réunion des Industriels in 1829. In 1814, Louis and his brother François formed an association along with Pierre Daniel Campiche, called Frères Rochat et Compagnie. To complicate matters, there were ties between the various Rochats. For example, Louis Rochat from l'Abbaye worked with Antoine (son of Frédéric) for a time, around 1850. It is however clear that the Rochat family produced many of the finest and most complex <b>singing</b> <b>bird</b> objects. They also built some of the smallest <b>singing</b> <b>bird</b> boxes ever made.|$|R
