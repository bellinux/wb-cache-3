60|$|The most {{remarkable}} varieties are {{afforded by the}} apple and the melon, and some account of these will be given as illustrating the effects of slight variations accumulated by selection. All our apples {{are known to have}} descended from the common crab of our hedges (Pyrus malus), and from this at least a thousand distinct varieties have been produced. These differ greatly in the size and form of the fruit, in its colour, and in the texture of the skin. They further differ in the time of ripening, in their flavour, and in their keeping properties; but apple trees also differ in many other ways. The foliage of the different varieties can often be distinguished by peculiarities of form and colour, and it varies considerably in the time of its appearance; in some hardly a leaf appears till the tree is in full bloom, while others produce their leaves so early as almost to hide the flowers. The flowers differ in size and colour, and in one case in structure also, that of the St. Valery apple having a double calyx with ten divisions, and fourteen styles with oblique stigmas, but without stamens or corolla. The flowers, therefore, have to be fertilised with the pollen from other varieties in order to produce fruit. The pips or seeds differ also in shape, size, and colour; some varieties are liable to canker more than others, while the Winter Majetin and one or two others have the strange constitutional peculiarity of never being attacked by the <b>mealy</b> <b>bug</b> even when all the other trees in the same orchard are infested with it.|$|E
50|$|Pests and {{diseases}} include scale insects, <b>mealy</b> <b>bug,</b> and rot.|$|E
50|$|Pests: Some common pests attacking citrus {{plants are}} the Citrus Root Weevil, Rust Mite, Aphids, <b>Mealy</b> <b>Bug,</b> Pine Tree Wood Borer, Red Spider Mite & various scale insects.|$|E
50|$|The tightly-packed rosettes are {{attractive}} to <b>mealy</b> <b>bugs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pseudococcus is a genus of {{unarmoured}} scale {{insects in}} the family Pseudococcidae, the <b>mealy</b> <b>bugs.</b> There are more than 150 species of Pseudococcus.|$|R
50|$|The usual {{problems}} for cultivation of Larryleachia apply to L. cactiformis, primary of these being {{the need for}} year- round warmth and sunlight, and the dangers of root rot and <b>mealy</b> <b>bugs.</b> Grafting L. cactiformis onto a rootstock tuber of a Ceropegia, such as Ceropegia woodii, and treating the plants against root <b>mealy</b> <b>bugs</b> should mostly alleviate these issues, though propagation is still a problem as the plant does not offset or seed readily and grows difficultly and slowly from seedling.|$|R
5000|$|In {{glasshouse}} cultivation the major pests are red spider mite, <b>mealy</b> <b>bug,</b> thrips and scale insects. [...] In outdoor cultivation in New Zealand {{there are no}} significant pests.|$|E
50|$|Pests and diseases: Streptocarpus are {{generally}} pest and disease-free. However, {{the most common}} afflictions are aphids and <b>mealy</b> <b>bug.</b> These are easily treatable with commercial insecticides or cultural pest removal methods.|$|E
50|$|As {{biological}} control agent outside Australia, C. montrouzieri has the common name <b>Mealy</b> <b>bug</b> destroyer.C. montrouzieri was introduced into California in 1891 by Albert Koebele to control the citrus mealybug. It has also been introduced to New Zealand for biocontrol.|$|E
50|$|Crassula nudicaulis {{is easy to}} grow as a potplant in a gravelly medium. <b>Mealy</b> <b>bugs</b> and fungal {{diseases}} {{can cause}} problems, and over-watering should be avoided. Propagation is by division, offsets or leaf cuttings.|$|R
50|$|Hawai'i pokeweed is {{susceptible}} to harm by ants, scale, aphids, and <b>mealy</b> <b>bugs.</b> Scale are tiny parasitic insects that attach themselves to plants and live off of the sap in the plant. The insects appear as tiny bumps and commonly are mistaken for a disease. <b>Mealy</b> <b>bugs</b> {{are very similar to}} scale in that they too feed off of the sap of the plant. They have a waxy white outer layer and accrue in bumps which resemble meal. Aphids again feed off the sap but they are simply insects. Ants cut off portions of leaves and bring them back to their colonies for consumption.|$|R
50|$|Similar {{problems}} {{have been reported in}} India, with both <b>mealy</b> <b>bugs</b> and aphids although a survey of small Indian farms between 2002 and 2008 concluded Bt cotton adoption has led to higher yields and lower pesticide use, decreasing over time.|$|R
50|$|The {{plant is}} {{susceptible}} to <b>mealy</b> <b>bug</b> infection, which can result in growth retardation and also cause high fungal contaminations in in vitro studies. To reduce the mealy bugâ€™s infection, 90% ethanol can be directly applied to the infestations using paint brushes.|$|E
50|$|The {{efficiency}} of insect-killing nature of Photorhabdus species {{and its potential}} use as biopesticide have been studied. Use of Photorhabdus species alone as biopesticide, independent of its nematode symbiont, against the cabbage white butterfly, Pieris brassicae, mango <b>mealy</b> <b>bug,</b> Drosicha mangiferae and the pupae of the diamond back moth, Plutella xylostella has been demonstrated successful.|$|E
5000|$|Light {{intensity}} has {{the effect}} of reducing swelling in shoots while plants in the shade show more severe symptoms. [...] Temperature and nutrition have no significant effect. [...] Since mealy bugs are the vectors of the virus, environmental conditions favorable to mealy bugs could increase the spread of the virus. Planococcus njalensis population density is closely correlated with density of ants in the Crematogaster genus, which build protective carton tents over the <b>mealy</b> <b>bug</b> colonies. [...] High-density planting can facilitate the spread of the virus when mealy bugs are able to go from plant to plant through the interlocked canopy. [...] Aside from crawling from plant to plant, mealy bugs can be dispersed by wind as well. In controlled trials, 340 feet was the maximum distance a <b>mealy</b> <b>bug</b> could be spread from an infected plant to a cacao seedling by wind dispersal. In dry conditions, aerial dispersal is increased.|$|E
50|$|The larvae {{are either}} herbivorous or carnivorous. In the early summer, the larvae attack the flower buds, flowers, young fruit, and young growth of Opuntia species, {{while in the}} late summer and autumn they are predacious on {{cochineal}} <b>mealy</b> <b>bugs</b> of the Dactylopius genus, which feed on prickly pear. The larvae live singly in tunnels in the segments beneath the cochineal cultures. If all <b>mealy</b> <b>bugs</b> have been eaten before the larva is full grown, it may extend the tunnel for some distance and complete its development as a plant feeder. The larvae are grey green or black green. Pupation takes place in a white cocoon among debris around the host plant.|$|R
5|$|Viruses and pests affect {{yield of}} Bt cotton varieties. Cotton leaf curl virus, {{which is a}} plant {{pathogenic}} virus of the family Geminiviridae, stunts plant growth seriously affecting yield. Pests like White Fly, <b>Mealy</b> <b>Bugs,</b> Aphids, Pink Boll Worm infect the plants reducing yield.|$|R
2500|$|The lack of {{precipitation}} in many wine regions make irrigation a necessity. Sprinkler and drip irrigation systems {{are used to}} provide anywhere from [...] of extra water a year. Modern winemakers are developing new techniques {{and an understanding of}} the role that water stress plays in the development of quality wine grape production. Producers who do not irrigate will sometimes use the phrase [...] "dryland" [...] or [...] "dry farmed" [...] on their wine labels as a marketing angle. Besides irrigation, an important concern for vineyard owners is the threat of vineyard pests such as <b>mealy</b> <b>bugs</b> and baboons. To combat these hazards, some vineyard owners will utilise Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programmes such as the importation of ladybugs, a natural predator of <b>mealy</b> <b>bugs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Gluconacetobacter sacchari is {{a species}} of acetic acid {{bacteria}} first isolated from the leaf sheath of sugar cane and from the pink sugar-cane <b>mealy</b> <b>bug</b> (Saccharicoccus sacchari) on sugar cane growing in Queensland and northern New South Wales. The type strain of this species is strain SRI 1794T (=DSM 12717T). It is notable for its production of bacterial cellulose and for being an endophyte in sugar cane.|$|E
50|$|If only {{a single}} {{seedling}} is infected in a new plantation, it may seem insignificant at first. However, once the canopy starts to grow together with interlocking branches, <b>mealy</b> <b>bug</b> movement is facilitated and the virus can quickly spread to the whole plantation.Since the virus is transmitted readily through seed, only seed that {{is known to be}} free of the virus should be planted.|$|E
50|$|The plant {{requires}} {{a reasonable amount}} of water; more water is needed if flower buds are present. Most species prefer full sun, although some sub-species could be sensitive to too much sun. The plant is resistant to frost, but temperatures above 40 F (6C) are best. The plant may be propagated from leaves and cuttings. It does not suffer from pests, other than the occasional <b>mealy</b> <b>bug.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pests of Scadoxus in {{cultivation}} in the UK include <b>mealy</b> <b>bugs</b> and narcissus {{bulb fly}} (Merodon equestris). Red spider mites (Tetranychus species), slugs and snails can also cause problems. In South Africa, where species such as S. puniceus can be grown outside, lily borer (Brithys crini) attacks plants.|$|R

5000|$|Planococcus njalensis {{population}} density is closely correlated with density of ants in the Crematogaster genus, which build protective carton tents over the <b>mealy</b> <b>bug</b> colonies. [...] Crematogaster populations however are {{negatively correlated with}} populations of ants of the Oecophylla genus. [...] This could be a natural biological control that is worth considering if agents to control the Crematogaster ants are developed, since they should not target Oecophylla ants as well.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{planting}} any new plantation, it is {{advised that}} all obviously infected {{trees in the}} surrounding plantations be removed beforehand. Also, a cordon, or gap, should be left around the entire plantation, putting the new plants a recommended 10 meters away from any old plantations that could contain infected trees. [...] It is also recommended that the cordon be planted with a CSSV-resistant crop to provide a physical barrier to the <b>mealy</b> <b>bug</b> vectors.|$|E
50|$|Banana streak MY virus (BSMYV) is a plant {{virus that}} causes banana streak disease of banana (Musa) species, which results in {{chlorotic}} streaks in the leaves and a reduced crop. The virus has been recovered from Australia, India and Tonga. It is composed of a double-stranded DNA genome and may exist in either an infectious episomal form or an endogenous form which is integrated into the host DNA. It is spread by several species of <b>mealy</b> <b>bug.</b>|$|E

Speare of the Hawaiian Sugar Plantersâ€™ Association in 1912; Speare observed the fungus sporulating on sugarcane <b>mealy</b> <b>bugs</b> (Pseudococcus sacchari) that had died while feeding on the cane leaf sheaths. It is sometimes found on black olives, improperly stored food grains and peanuts.|$|R
40|$|Coconut {{shells and}} coir are {{considered}} as wastes of coconut based products {{that have not}} been utilized efficiently. By using these abundant bioresources, which are widely available in Thailand, as raw materials, we were able to producewood vinegars that may be alternatives to termiticides and pesticides. The wood vinegars were obtained from carbonizationprocess using a 200 -liter fuel tank as charcoal brazier under temperatures of 300 - 400 Â°C. In this study, termiticidal and pesticidalactivities of wood vinegars were evaluated against termite workers, Odontotermes sp., and striped <b>mealy</b> <b>bugs,</b> Ferrisiavirgata, using direct contact application. Percent mortalities in the experiments were recorded after 24 hours and correctedfor control mortality with Abbottâ€™s formula. Wood vinegars of 850, 696, and 898 milliliters were produced from coconut shell(wood vinegar A) and the mixture of coconut shell and coir (wood vinegar B) and the mixture of coconut shell, coir and holybasil (wood vinegar C), respectively. Wood vinegar A exhibited high termiticidal activity against termite workers at a dilutionof 1 : 50, wood vinegar: sterile water (v/v). By this way, 85 % (81. 71 % corrected mortality) of termite workers were killed afterthe 24 hours of test. At a dilution of 1 : 10, both wood vinegar A and B had exhibited high pesticidal activities against mealybugs, 96 % (95. 12 % corrected mortality) of striped <b>mealy</b> <b>bugs</b> were killed by those wood vinegars. In the weakest termiticidaland pesticidal activities, wood vinegar C was able to kill 60 % (51. 22 % corrected mortality) of termite workers at a dilution of 1 : 50 within 24 hours. Also it killed 93 % (91. 89 % corrected mortality) of striped <b>mealy</b> <b>bugs</b> with a dilution of 1 : 10 (v/v) withinthe same amount of time. Post-hoc comparisons (Tukey test) revealed that wood vinegar A possessed the most effectivetermiticidal activity against termite workers. However, a similarity in high pesticidal activity was found among three woodvinegars against striped <b>mealy</b> <b>bugs.</b> The termiticidal and pesticidal properties of these wood vinegars can be attributed to themode of action of their active components...|$|R
50|$|Technomyrmex albipes, a small ant {{introduced}} to Mauritius that came originally from the Indo-Pacific area, seals the flowers of Roussea with clay to protect <b>mealy</b> <b>bugs.</b> These drink the sap and excrete a sugary urine that is {{collected by the}} ants. The ants attack animals that visit the plant, and so prevent the blue-tailed day gecko from pollinating the flowers and from eating the fruit, {{and in this way}} seriously hampering the reproduction of Roussea.|$|R
50|$|Stephanotis {{are grown}} for their {{strongly}} perfumed, waxy, tubular, usually white flowers. Leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and leathery. Stephanotis {{is a beautiful}} but difficult plant - it hates sudden changes in temperature, needs constant cool conditions in winter and is attractive to scale and <b>mealy</b> <b>bug.</b> The stems of Stephanotis can reach 10 ft or more, but it is usually sold twined around a wire hoop. The heavily scented waxy flowers appear in summer.|$|E
50|$|As succulents go, Cotyledon spp. {{certainly}} are rewarding garden and indoor subjects, practically independent of irrigation {{in all but}} full desert conditions, though they cannot survive poor light or bad drainage in the wet. Their main enemies are sucking bugs, members of the suborder Auchenorrhyncha such as the <b>mealy</b> <b>bug</b> (Pseudococcus) and similar insects. Though not spectacular, they are elegantly decorative and often interesting in shape. The inflorescences of the larger species often make fine components of dried arrangements in floral design.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this work was to design an ipm {{strategy}} and tactics for <b>mealy</b> <b>bugs</b> on citrus. To this end, the characterisation of the respective life system and {{the identification of the}} outbreak type were considered. A survey of <b>mealy</b> <b>bugs</b> on citrus groves was conducted in order to elucidate the identity and relative importance of the species associated with the crop in Portugal. The spatial distribution, i. e., dispersion, of these coccids was studied in the region of Setubal by sampling with stratification and using regression techniques, showing an aggregated pattern. The study of the dynamics of fruit infestation, following the sampling protocol proposed in Cavalloro and Prota (1983), suggested the existence of two different patterns, which due to their predictive nature may be used as a tool to improve sampling efficiency in decision making. The monitoring studies of the key-species, Planacoccus citri (Risso), with pheromone traps, showed that male catches are affected by temperature, fact that must be considered on the biological interpretation of results.
