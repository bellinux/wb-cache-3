It has been pointed out in [1] that an originally conformant packet may become non-conformant at the egress in the presence of variable packet length, even though the packet is transmitted at a constant bitrate. We refer to this phenomenon by using a terminology conformance deterioration in this paper, and further analyze the probability of conformance deterioration relating to link speed and token rate. We demonstrate that the conformance deterioration could reach up to   ¡  £¢ in the worst case. In order to eliminate conformance deterioration, two <b>measures,</b> enlarging <b>bucket</b> size or reshaping at the policing node, are investigated by simulation.

A statistical technique, semivariogram analysis, is used to isolate the variance resulting from the observational error from that resulting from the spatial variability in a dataset of the differences of paired SST reports. The method is largely successful, although {{there is some evidence that}} in high-variability regions the separation of random and spatial error is not complete, which may have led to an overestimate of the random observational error in these regions. The error estimates are robust to changes in the details of the regression method used to estimate the spatial variability. The resulting error estimates are shown to vary with region, time, the quality control applied, the method of measurement, the recruiting country, and the source of the data. SST data <b>measured</b> using <b>buckets</b> typically contain smaller random errors than those measured using an engine-intake thermometer. Errors are larger in the 1970 s, probably because of problems with data transmission in the early days of the Global Telecommunications System. The best estimate of the global average random error in ICOADS ship SST for the period of 1970 – 97 is 1. 2 °C if the estimates are weighted by ocean area and 1. 3 °C if the estimates are weighted by the number of observations...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to quantify the amount of water moving upward to the root zone. Automated water content reflectometers were used to monitor soil water content across a landscape in Central Iowa, which had varying shallow water tables. Either manual or automated water table depths were <b>measured.</b> Tipping <b>bucket</b> raingage and eddy covariance evapotranspiration (ET) methods were used to measure rain and evapotranspiration as part of the water balance. Upward water movement ranges were determined from water balance and uncertainties for each component (rain, ET, change in soil water content). In 2006 out of 53 dry days (days that did not have any rain), 37, 43, and 46 d showed net upward flux for shoulder, backslope, and toeslope positions, shown by an uncertainty range that did not overlap zero. In 2007, 37 out of 62 dry days showed net upward flux for the toeslope position. The mean significant net upward flux for dry days was 2. 6, 3. 2, and 3. 1 mm d– 1 for the shoulder, backslope, and toeslope positions in 2006, and 2. 5 mm d– 1 for the toeslope position in 2007.

To investigate the sloshing phenomenon, linear potential theory together with linear modal theory was implemented, {{and a model}} test at NTNU's Lilletanken using a floating circular cylinder with a free-surface on the inside was performed. The model scale was set to 1 : 81, representing a full scale enclosed fish farm plant with a diameter of 40 meters.

40|$|Weather {{observations}} from Voluntary Observing Ships (VOS) have been analysed {{in an attempt}} to identify biases resulting from different observing practices. The observations were taken from the Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere Dataset (COADS) for the period 1980 to 1997. A new quality control procedure was developed and implemented based on a comparison of local data rather than on climatological limits and individual ships were tracked to remove data with corrupt positions. Metadata containing information on measurement methods from a World Meteorological Organisation catalogue of VOS was associated with individual ship observations to enhance the information already contained within the COADS. Observational pairs were constructed from the COADS where reports were colocated within 50 km and 1 hour. This procedure reduced uncertainty about the comparisons of different measurement methods due to spatial and temporal variability. Sea surface temperature (SST) reports made using a bucket and thermometer were shown to be biased cool in conditions where surface heat loss was expected to be large. Bucket SST reports, which sample only the near surface, were relatively warm under conditions where a shallow diurnal warm layer in the ocean might be expected to form. Biases in the nighttime bucket SST reports were quantitatively assessed using a statistical technique that accounted for the error structure of the dataset. This suggested that at moderate wind speeds bucket SST data are biased by an approximately constant fraction of the air - sea temperature difference. SST derived from the engine intake thermometer were much noisier than those <b>measured</b> using <b>buckets</b> but, on average, no significant bias could be detected. This contradicts earlier studies which are comprehensively reviewed. Biases in air temperature measurements depend on the exposure of the sensor (which depends on recruiting country), on the incident shortwave radiation, the ventilation of the sensor and the past heating of the sensor. Regional variations in the height of the air temperature measurement are shown to be significant as are changes in observation height with time...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNowadays, the {{utilization}} ofmonitoring systems and advanced IT technology {{in order to}} support maintenance management in complex machinery systems is widely-used {{at all levels of the}} maintenance. One of the purposes for using such systems in a copper ore underground mine is to assess the performance of self-propelled machines, e. g. loaders. The effectiveness of the loader operation might be estimated by taking into account different sources of information and evaluation criteria. This paper presents a method for the identification of a loader operation regime: loading, haulage and unloading of ore. It is expected that such a cycle should be repeated during a single shift. The proposed algorithm is based on the measurements of the hydraulic pressure acquired on the bucket's hydraulic cylinder. This signal is very noisy, thus further analysisrequires it's smoothing. We propose to incorporate the Kalman filter in order to smooth the signal. Kalman filtering is commonly used in optimal filtering of nonstationary signals. Further steps of the proposed algorithm indicate moments of basic loader's routines. Finally, the information about the number and duration of loading and unloading cycles is provided. The algorithm is illustrated by an analysis of real data from the monitoring system that describes the pressure <b>measured</b> on the <b>bucket's</b> hydraulic cylinder during the entire 6 -hour-long shift...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Force {{feedback}} sensors {{are useful}} for the planning of robotic digging trajectories. In particular, when combined with force-control algorithms it becomes possible to sense buried objects and to determine the weight of excavated materials. The proposed force sensor system makes use of hydraulic cylinder pressure and thereby measures machine force indirectly. Successful implementation of such an approach will {{eliminate the need for}} expensive, direct-force sensors. Measurements of pressures in candidate cylinders were compared with laboratory-measured stroke and force. To measure force in every position and during the motion of a backhoe, kinematic, static and dynamic inertial parameters of the bucket, arm and other links have to be considered. From these data a friction model of the hydraulic cylinders can be developed. The present work involves the determination of these friction parameters for an excavator arm using position <b>measures</b> of the <b>bucket</b> and boom, cylinder pressures and the attitude of the excavator boom. Combined, these represent the “dynamic tare ” of system. The work includes a practical approach to filtering regression matrix to do not measure accelerations. The methods allows one to carry out inertial parameters for a full machine, in order to verified design and drawning of costruction machine or to use as input for simulation of machine dynamics...|$|R

However, no published field performance data existed on pollutant removal capabilities. Replicated rain gardens were constructed in Haddam, CT, to capture shingled-roof runoff. The gardens were sized {{to store the}} first 2. 54 cm (1 inch) of runoff. Influent, overflow and percolate flow were <b>measured</b> using tipping <b>buckets</b> and sampled passively. Precipitation was also measured and sampled for quality. All weekly composite water samples were analyzed for total phosphorus (TP), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), ammonia-nitrogen (NH 3 -N), and nitrite+nitrate-nitrogen (NO 3 -N). Monthly composite samples were analyzed for copper (Cu), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn). Redox potential was measured using platinum electrodes. Poor treatment of NO 3 -N, TKN, organic-N, and TP in roof runoff was observed. Many Cu, Pb and Zn samples were below detection limit, so statistical analysis was not performed on these pollutants. The only pollutants significantly lower in the effluent than in the influent were NH 3 -N in both gardens and total-N in one garden. The design used for these rain gardens worked well for overall flow retention, but had little impact pollutant concentrations in percolate. These results suggest that if an underdrain is not connected to the stormwater system, high flow and pollutant retention could be achieved with the 2. 54 cm design method...|$|R
40|$|Sublevel caving (SLC) is an {{underground}} mass mining method used to extract iron ore from the Kiirunavaara and Malmberget mines. Although both mines use SLC as the mining method, their implementation varies {{in terms of}} mine design, ring design and draw control strategy. The Kiirunavaara mine has a continuous and massive ore deposit which allows a standard mine design layout, while the Malmberget mine has scattered ore bodies with varying mine design parameters. The two mines also employ different opening techniques for production drifts. Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB (LKAB) uses different information systems to run these highly mechanized mines. The information generated by the various systems is transferred between the different unit operations and is used to optimize the mining process. The mines use GIRON to create, store and display different information related to the mining operation. Information on all unit operations is stored {{in a number of}} databases inside GIRON. The two loading related information systems which support the loading operation are the Wireless Loader Information System (WOLIS) and the Loadrite system. The Loadrite system <b>measures</b> the <b>bucket</b> weights being loaded by the Load Haul Dump (LHD) machines at the draw point. This information, along with information on planned ring tonnage etc., is displayed to the LHD operator inside the LHD machine using WOLIS. WOLIS provides online data on the ring performance such as grades, tonnage extracted etc. to the LHD operators and the production team. In SLC, the different aspects of loading at the draw point include loading procedures, loading issues, loading criteria and loading constraints. Loading procedures include the practices and precautions taken during loading at the draw point. Loading issues include events observed at both mines, such as brow failure, ring freeze, hang-ups etc. Although most loading issues are handled in a similar manner, hang-up handling techniques are different at the Kiirunavaara and Malmberget mines. Loading criteria and constraints along with the nature of material flow collectively provide a complete understanding of the draw control strategy. Loading criteria comprise a set of rules or guidelines for loading and closing a draw point. LKAB uses WOLIS to enforce the loading criteria for its SLC operations. Loading constraints include production constraints, grade control and mining constraints which must be followed for a safe and sustainable mining operation. A baseline analysis of the draw control and loading operations at the Kiirunavaara and Malmberget mines is summarized in this report using information collected through internal documents, meetings, e-mails and manuals.   Improved Resource Efficiency through Dynamic Loading Contro...|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} to quantify systematic errors in {{two types of}} sea surface temperature (SST) observations: bucket and engine-intake measurements. A simple linear model is proposed where the SST <b>measured</b> using a <b>bucket</b> is cooled or warmed by {{a fraction of the}} air–sea temperature difference and the SST measured using an engine intake has a constant bias. The model is applied to collocated nighttime observations made at moderate wind speeds, allowing the effects of solar radiation and strong vertical gradients in the upper ocean to be neglected. The analysis is complicated by large random errors in all of the variables used. To estimate coefficients in this model, a novel type of linear regression, where errors in two variables are correlated with each other, is introduced. Because of the uncertainty in a priori estimates of the error covariance matrix, a Bayesian analysis of the regression problem is developed, and maximum likelihood approximations to the posterior distributions of the model parameters are obtained. Results show that the temperature change in bucket SST resulting from the air–sea temperature difference can be detected. The analysis suggests that bucket SST may be in error by a fraction from 0. 12 ° ± 0. 02 ° to 0. 16 ° ± 0. 02 °C of the air–sea temperature difference. When this temperature change of the bucket SST is accounted for, a warm bias in engine-intake SST in the mid- to late 1970 s and the 1980 s was found to be smaller than that suggested by previous studies, ranging between 0. 09 ° ± 0. 06 ° and 0. 18 ° ± 0. 05 °C. For the early 1990 s the model suggests that the engine-intake SSTs may have a cold bias of − 0. 13 ° ± 0. 07 °C...|$|R
40|$|Complex {{technical}} {{systems such}} as packaging lines, computer networks, material handling systems, are crucial for the operations at the companies (or institutions) where they are installed. Companies require high availability because their primary processes may halt when these systems are down. High availability implies {{a high level of}} support and service activities, and, thus high support and service costs in the exploitation phase. Together with acquisition costs, operational costs and maybe some others, support and service costs constitute the Life Cycle Costs (LCC) of a system. Then the question is what portion of LCC consists of support and service costs? If this portion is high, the companies should take into account these costs more carefully in their decisions. In this work, we develop a Life Cycle Costs Measurement (LCCM) methodology by adapting a Life Cycle Costs Analysis (LCCA) approach. With this methodology, cost buckets that compose LCC of the systems are determined and costs are <b>measured</b> for each <b>bucket.</b> LCC is just the sum of those costs then. This methodology is used to measure the LCC of complex systems at two different sites. These systems are manufactured by an Engineer-To-Order (ETO) company that we have cooperated with. The company designs and engineers systems from existing building blocks such that the customer requirements are met. We mainly focus on the measurement of the cost buckets that stem from the exploitation phase of these systems. The cost figures show that the nominal support and service costs are more than the acquisition costs and account for a significant portion of LCC. This suggests that both the suppliers and the buyers of these systems should deal with support and service costs seriously, when investments in new systems are made. 1...|$|R

Flow was <b>measured</b> using tipping <b>buckets.</b> Weekly composite water samples were analyzed for total phosphorus (TP), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), ammonia-nitrogen (NH 3 -N), and nitrite+nitrate-nitrogen (NO 3 -N). Monthly composite samples were analyzed for copper (Cu), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn). Redox potential and water temperature were also measured. The first year of results indicated high retention of NH 3 -N, but low retention of other nutrients and metals measured. Export of TP and Pb from the system was noted. Over 98 % of inflow volume was retained by the system. The {{second phase of the}} study was then initiated; the paired watershed study design and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) were then used to assess whether the creation of a saturated zone in a rain garden impacted retention of pollutants by the garden. Results show high retention of flow; only 0. 9 % overflowed. Overall, according to ANOVA analysis, the rain garden significantly reduced concentrations of NO 3 -N, NH 3 -N, and TN in influent roof runoff. TP concentrations significantly increased, likely due to release from the soil. Poor retentions of TKN, organic-N, Cu, Pb, and Zn were observed. As a result of saturation, ANCOVA results showed significant reductions in TN (18 %) concentrations. Redox potential also decreased due to treatment. Water temperature was significantly (p = 0. 01) increased by the rain gardens during the fall and winter. Overall, these rain gardens provided runoff control, but water quality renovation was not good. It may be necessary to install a rain garden with an underdrain in some situations. However, given the high overall retention of flow found for the 2. 54 cm design method used in this study, a rain garden could be an effective BMP in reducing flow and pollutant loads if an underdrain were not connected to the stormwater system. An evaluation of several rain garden sizing methods was also performed, and two Stella ® models were constructed using data obtained from the study. ...|$|R
40|$|Dinghy sailing {{performance}} {{is related to}} hiking endurance (Blackburn & Hubinger, 1995; Tan et al., 2006; Vangelakoudi et al., 2007). However, {{there is no clear}} understanding of the underlying physiological mechanisms of hiking. Previous studies established during upwind sailing a significant disproportionate increase in heart rate (up to 75 % HRpeak) and oxygen uptake (up to 40 % VO 2 peak), reflecting the isometric tension on the anterior body muscles (Vogiatzis et al., 1995). Furthermore, significant increases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure indicate the isometric nature of this exercise (Blackburn, 1994). However, lactate concentration ([La]) during upwind sailing does not exceed 4 mmol·l- 1 which suggests only a small oxygen and energy deficit during upwind sailing (Vogiatzis et al., 2008). Consensus was reached to use the term quasi-isometric to categorise the hiking exercise (Spurway, 2007). In the mean time, the cardiorespiratory, -vascular and metabolic demands during upwind sailing have been thoroughly investigated whereas the muscular mechanisms have only been superficially studied. This research enhances our understanding of dinghy sailing performance by pursuing 3 research aims, that is: (1) investigating the determinants of dinghy sailing performance, (2) developing a sailing ergometer which accurately represents the physiological responses during on-water upwind sailing, and (3) exploring the physiological mechanisms during submaximal (quasi-) isometric knee extension exercise (as a part of upwind sailing exercise) with a distinct focus on the muscle level. To achieve these goals, five studies with each their own purpose and design have been conducted. The illustration (A) above demonstrates the different study populations, designs, methods and aims. Results and conclusions: The determinants of dinghy sailing performance include motor coordination skills and incremental knee extension strength. Motor coordination skills for Optimist sailors (i. e. ≤ 15 years) were highly related to sailing level, whereas incremental knee extension strength endurance (i. e. <b>measured</b> by <b>bucket</b> test) for dynamic hikers (i. e. > 15 years) was related to sailing level. The contribution of incremental knee extension strength endurance to performance for Optimist and Laser sailors was related to a delay in muscle fatigue. The muscle fatigue for Laser sailors was clearly related to maximal quadriceps strength. This result emphasizes the importance of implementing dry-land motor coordination skill training for Optimist sailors and dry-land maximal strength training for Laser sailors. In addition, an innovative biologically validated upwind sailing emulation ergometer was developed by applying a biofeedback system to measure the hiking moment. As such, the researcher can impose a certain quasi-isometric upwind sailing protocol to several subjects or to one subject on different occasions. The emulation ergometer can be implemented as tool for sailing performance diagnostics and training follow-up. Optimist and Laser sailors’ quadriceps muscle fatigue (as indicated by a decrease in mean power frequency an increase in root mean square) increased throughout submaximal (quasi-) isometric knee extension exercise (as a part of upwind sailing exercise). However, after an initial increase, a steady state phase was observed, presumably due to compensation strategies (e. g. tacking, fore and aft movements, and alternate-legs-strategy) conducted by the sailors to delay exhaustion. This results in a momentary relaxation of the quadriceps muscle causing a rapid outflow of deoxygenated blood and inflow of fresh oxygenated blood. Optimist sailors possess other fiber recruitment or O 2 extraction patterns, probably to postpone exhaustion and increase knee extension strength endurance, than untrained controls...|$|R

The existing rain attenuationprobability prediction method for the terrestrial radio communication systems was establishedalmost 38 years ago, and {{so far it has}} been used with several improvements, however, it should bere-evaluated from the view point of accuracy and applicability for the following reasons; (a) theapplication of the radio communication systems at {{the frequencies}} above almost 10 GHz becomesdiversified, (b) the rainfall statistical nature could be changed in recent years by climatic changessuch as the Global Warming phenomenon and Heat Island phenomenon. This paper summarizesthe study aimed at the establishment of the accurate and flexibly applicable new rain attenuationprobability prediction method. In chapter- 2, background information is prepared to be helpful for understanding about rainattenuation probability prediction. To establish the new rain attenuation probability predictionmethod, rainfall data at sufficient numbers of locations in the whole country are needed and onlyAMeDAS rainfall data provided by Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) could be available forthis purpose. It is considered that cumulative distribution function (CDF) of rainfall rate forshorter interval is required to predict rain attenuation probability accurately, however it is knownthat time-averaged value of rainfall rate for every 1 -minute (1 -minute rainfall rate) is sufficientbecause rain attenuation on a radio link is an integration of point rain attenuations along a radiopath. In chapter- 3, equipments and configurations of rainfall and rain attenuation measurements forthe study are shown. In chapter- 4, it is discussed about the method to obtain 1 -minute rainfall rate CDFs accuratelyfrom the AMeDAS low resolution (0. 5 mm) 1 -minute rainfall data <b>measured</b> by tipping <b>bucket</b> raingauge. The study was done using the data measured by high resolution (0. 0083 mm) dropcounting rain gauge (DCRG) and the artificial 1 -minute rainfall data (same as AMeDAS data) made from the DCRG data (summing up 0. 0083 mm and counting at each 0. 5 mm). As a resultof the study, the second-base distribution process with random positioning of 0. 5 mm count pulsewithin each pulse counted minute is proposed as the effective method. In chapter- 5, it is discussed about the suitable distribution model for the rain attenuationprobability prediction method applicable {{in a wide range of}} probability. As a result of the studyabout the capability of approximation to 1 -minute rainfall rate CDFs obtained from the AMeDAS 1 -minute rainfall data at 136 locations, it is shown that M-distribution has superior capability toGamma distribution, Log-normal distribution and Conditional Log-normal distribution. In chapter- 6, it is shown that the spatial correlation characteristics can be approximated well byexp(-a d) for longer distance part and by exp(- bd) for shorter distance part (“d” is distance ／border is located between 2 and 3 km) as a result of the analysis of rainfall data measured at 11 locations around Otemachi in Tokyo. Also, considering that the rain attenuation coefficient(rain attenuation per kilometer) is proportional to n-th power of rainfall rate (“n” = 0. 63 ~ 1. 7 /ITU-R Rec. P. 838 - 3), it is shown that the spatial correlation characteristics vary remarkablydepending on the value of “n”, and the equations to approximate the relation between “n” and thecoefficient of the spatial correlation characteristics “α and β” are given. Furthermore, themethod to integrate a CDF of n-th power of point 1 -minute rainfall rate along a radio path usingthe spatial correlation characteristics of n-th power of 1 -minute rainfall rate is given. In chapter- 7, it is discussed about the method to obtain a 1 -minute rainfall rate CDF accuratelyfrom different integration time rainfall data such as AMeDAS 10 and 60 minutes rainfall data. As a result of the study using AMeDAS rainfall data at 136 locations, the effective conversionmethod based on M-distribution using a mean value and a standard deviation of a real probabilitydistribution of 10 and 60 minutes rainfall data is proposed. In chapter- 8, on the basis of results of the studies in chapter- 5 and - 6, the new M-distributionbased rain attenuation probability prediction method is proposed. The proposed method utilizesthe two types of spatial correlation characteristics and the integation process of 1 -minute rainfallrate CDF along a radio path shown in chapter- 6. The comparison of the rain attenuation CDFsobtained from the measured rain attenuation data and obtained by the proposed and existingprediction methods shows that the proposed prediction method gives superior accuracy to theexisting prediction method. In chapter- 9, the 0. 01 % and 0. 0001 % values of 1 -minute rainfall rate CDFs for long years(1976 to 2002 as longest) at 1150 locations in Japan obtained applying above methods (chapter- 4 and 7) to AMeDAS rainfall data are shown as the parameters for the proposed prediction method. The prepared parameters include not only the mean value but also the standard deviation andunique two additional factors related to the concept of safety factor so that the proposed predictionmethod makes it possible to predict rain attenuation probability corresponding to expected MTBF(Mean Time Between Failure / in this case Failure means occurrence of unsatisfactory condition). 電気通信大学 200...|$|R
