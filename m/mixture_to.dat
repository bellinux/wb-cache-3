5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} (GMAW), also known as metal inert gas or MIG welding, is a {{semi-automatic}} or automatic process that uses a continuous wire feed as an electrode and an inert or semi-inert gas <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> protect the weld from contamination. Since the electrode is continuous, welding speeds are greater for GMAW than for SMAW.|$|E
5|$|Most {{computers}} {{require the}} diver {{to specify the}} mixture before the dive, but some allow the choice of <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> be changed during the dive, which allows {{for the use of}} gas switching for accelerated decompression. A third category, mostly used by closed circuit rebreather divers, monitors the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing mix using a remote oxygen sensor, but requires diver intervention to specify the inert gas constituents and ratio of the mix in use.|$|E

Nickel and manganese in steel add to its tensile strength and make the austenite form of the iron-carbon solution more stable, chromium increases hardness and melting temperature, and vanadium also increases hardness while making it less prone to metal fatigue.|$|E

Visual effects for the black oil were created with molasses, chocolate syrup, and computer-generated imagery (CGI).

5|$|The {{large scale}} {{production}} {{of ice cream}} also resulted from the ice trade. Ice cream had been produced in small quantities {{since at least the}} 17th century, but this depended both on having large quantities of ice available, and substantial amounts of labour to manufacture it. This was because using ice to freeze ice cream relies both on the application of salt to an ice <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> produce a cooling effect, and also on constantly agitating the <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> produce the light texture associated with ice cream. By the 1820s and 1830s, the availability of ice in the cities of the U.S. east coast meant that ice cream was becoming increasingly popular, but still an essentially luxury product. In 1843, however, a new ice cream maker was patented by Nancy Johnson which required far less physical effort and time; similar designs were also produced in England and France. Combined with the growing ice trade, ice cream became much more widely available and consumed in greater quantities. In Britain, Norwegian ice was used by the growing Italian community in London from the 1850s onwards to popularise ice cream with the general public.|$|E
5|$|Mephedrone can be {{synthesised}} {{in several}} ways. The simplest method, {{due to the}} availability of the compounds, is to add 4-methylpropiophenone dissolved in glacial acetic acid to bromine, creating an oil fraction of 4'-methyl-2-bromopropiophenone. The oil fraction can then be dissolved in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and drops of the solution added to another solution of CH2Cl2-containing methylamine hydrochloride and triethylamine. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is then added and the aqueous layer is removed and turned alkaline using sodium hydroxide before the amine is extracted using CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2 is then evaporated using a vacuum, creating an oil which is then dissolved in a nonaqueous ether. Finally, HCl gas is bubbled through the <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> produce 4-methylmethcathinone hydrochloride. This method produces a mixture of both enantiomers and requires similar knowledge to that required to synthesise amphetamines and MDMA.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, it was {{confirmed}} that although relativistic effects are important, bohrium behaves {{like a typical}} group 7 element. A team at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) conducted a chemistry reaction using six atoms of 267Bh produced in the reaction between 249Bk and 22Ne ions. The resulting atoms were thermalised and reacted with a HCl/O2 <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> form a volatile oxychloride. The reaction also produced isotopes of its lighter homologues, technetium (as 108Tc) and rhenium (as 169Re). The isothermal adsorption curves were measured and gave strong evidence for the formation of a volatile oxychloride with properties similar to that of rhenium oxychloride. This placed bohrium as a typical member of group 7. The adsorption enthalpies of the oxychlorides of technetium, rhenium, and bohrium were measured in this experiment, agreeing very well with the theoretical predictions and implying a sequence of decreasing oxychloride volatility down group 7 of TcO3Cl > ReO3Cl > BhO3Cl.|$|E

25|$|Membrane {{distillation}} {{is a type}} of distillation {{in which}} vapors of a <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> be separated are passed through a membrane, which selectively permeates one component of mixture.

25|$|At {{this point}} in the {{synthesis}} of Taxol, the material was a racemic <b>mixture.</b> <b>To</b> obtain the desired enantiomer, allylic alcohol 4.9 was acylated with (1S)-(−)-camphanic chloride and dimethylaminopyridine, giving two diastereomers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to investigate the thermochemical properties of nonelectrolyte solutes dissolved in ternary solvent <b>mixtures,</b> and <b>to</b> develop mathematical expressions for predicting and describing behavior in the solvent mixtures. Forty-five ternary solvent systems were studied containing an ether (Methyl tert-butyl ether, Dibutyl ether, or 1, 4 -Dioxane), an alcohol (1 -Propanol, 2 -Propanol, 1 -Butanol, 2 -Butanol, or 2 -Methyl- 1 -propanol), and an alkane (Cyclohexane, Heptane, or 2, 2, 4 -Trimethylpentane) cosolvents. The Combined NIBS (Nearly Ideal Binary Solvent) /Redlich-Kister equation {{was used to assess}} the experimental data. The average percent deviation between predicted and observed values was less than ± 2 per cent error, documenting that this model provides a fairly accurate description of the observed solubility behavior. In addition, Mobile Order theory, the Kretschmer-Wiebe model, and the Mecke-Kempter model were extended <b>to</b> ternary solvent <b>mixtures</b> containing an alcohol (or an alkoxyalcohol) and alkane cosolvents. Expressions derived from Mobile Order theory predicted the experimental mole fraction solubility of anthracene in ternary alcohol + alkane + alkane <b>mixtures</b> <b>to</b> within ± 5. 8 %, in ternary alcohol + alcohol + alkane <b>mixtures</b> <b>to</b> within ± 4. 0 %, and in ternary alcohol + alcohol + alcohol <b>mixtures</b> <b>to</b> within ± 3. 6 %. In comparison, expressions derived from the Kretschmer-Wiebe model and the Mecke-Kempter model predicted the anthracene solubility in ternary alcohol + alkane + alkane <b>mixtures</b> <b>to</b> within ± 8. 2 % and ± 8. 8 %, respectively. The Kretschmer-Wiebe model and the Mecke-Kempter model could not be extended easily to systems containing two or more alcohol cosolvents...|$|R

25|$|Reactor salts {{are usually}} close <b>to</b> {{eutectic}} <b>mixtures</b> <b>to</b> reduce their melting point. A low melting point simplifies melting the salt at startup {{and reduces the}} risk of the salt freezing as it is cooled in the heat exchanger.|$|R
25|$|The {{increased}} {{partial pressure}} of oxygen {{due to the}} higher oxygen content of nitrox {{increases the risk of}} oxygen toxicity, which becomes unacceptable below the maximum operating depth of the <b>mixture.</b> <b>To</b> displace nitrogen without the increased oxygen concentration, other diluent gases can be used, usually helium, when the resultant three gas mixture is called trimix, and when the nitrogen is fully substituted by helium, heliox.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the potential of}} adding electric arc furnace slag <b>to</b> bituminous <b>mixtures</b> <b>to</b> be heated by microwaves. The susceptibility of bituminous <b>mixtures</b> <b>to</b> microwave energy is limited and so, {{in order to improve}} the energy performance of the heating process, it is necessary to incorporate additives or components <b>to</b> the <b>mixture</b> so as <b>to</b> improve the capacity for microwave heating. The article presents the results of adding various components, (steel wool, scrap tire wire, silicon carbide, iron filings) and an alternative aggregate: electric arc furnace slag. According to the results obtained in the laboratory, slag addition of at least 5 % by weight of the bituminous mixture represents the best option for both technical and economic reasons.
