5000|$|A <b>metering</b> <b>pump</b> moves {{a precise}} {{volume of liquid}} in a {{specified}} time period providing an accurate volumetric flow rate.

5000|$|Liquids {{are only}} very {{slightly}} compressible. This property of liquids lets <b>metering</b> <b>pumps</b> discharge liquids at high pressure. Since a liquid can be only slightly compressed during a discharge stroke, it is {{forced out of}} the pump head. Gases are much more compressible. <b>Metering</b> <b>pumps</b> are not good at pumping gases. Sometimes, a <b>metering</b> or similar <b>pump</b> has to be primed before operation, i. e. the pump head filled with the liquid to be pumped. When gas bubbles enter a pump head, the compression motion compresses the gas but has a hard time forcing it out of the pump head. The pump may stop pumping liquid with gas bubbles in the pump head even though mechanically the pump is going through the motions, repeatedly compressing and decompressing the bubbles. To prevent this type of [...] "vapor lock", chromatography solvents are often degassed before pumping.|$|R

50|$|Ice Protection {{with the}} TKS Ice Protection system is {{achieved}} by mounting laser-drilled titanium porous panels on the leading edges of the airframe. The panel skin is perforated with eight hundred 0.0025-inch-diameter laser-drilled holes per square inch. TKS fluid exudes through the panels on the leading edges of the wings, horizontal stabilizers. Fluid is also thoroughly distributed from the slinger-ring on the propeller and from the windshield spraybar. Secondary fairings or structures such as lift struts can also be protected. Engine inlets may be protected, as well. The fluid is pumped from a tank by an electrically-driven <b>metering</b> <b>pump</b> through a microfilter to proportioning units. Proportioning units contain calibrated capillary tubes that divide the flow to the individual needs of the porous panels and the slinger ring. One <b>metering</b> <b>pump</b> is provided for inadvertent systems. For systems certified for flight into known icing conditions (FIKI), two pumps are installed for redundancy and can be selected individually. Fluid for the windshield spraybar system is provided by an on-demand gear pump. One or two windshield pumps are provided depending on the certification basis. As the TKS Ice Protection system is used, any accumulation of debris is flushed out. Glycol has cleaning properties and will not harm the paint finish of the aircraft. No performance is lost from the system; only significant ice protection capabilities are added.|$|E

50|$|Check valves {{are often}} used with some types of pumps. Piston-driven and {{diaphragm}} <b>pumps</b> such as <b>metering</b> <b>pumps</b> and pumps for chromatography commonly use inlet and outlet ball check valves. These valves often look like small cylinders attached to the pump head on the inlet and outlet lines. Many similar pump-like mechanisms for moving volumes of fluids around use check valves such as ball check valves. The feed pumps or injectors which supply water to steam boilers are fitted with check valves to prevent back-flow.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order for}} the liquid {{injection}} molding process to fully occur, several mechanical components must be in place. Typically, a molding machine requires a <b>metered</b> <b>pumping</b> device in conjunction with an injection unit—a dynamic or static mixer is attached. An integrated system can aid in precision and process efficiency. The critical components of a liquid injection molding machine include: ...|$|R
5000|$|The maximum {{pressure}} rating of a <b>metering</b> <b>pump</b> {{is actually the}} top of the discharge pressure range the pump is guaranteed to pump against at a reasonably controllable flow rate. The pump itself is a pressurizing device often capable of exceeding its pressure rating, although not guaranteed to. For this reason, if there is any stop valve downstream of the pump, a pressure relief valve should be placed in between to prevent overpressuring of the tubing or piping line in case the stop valve is inadvertently shut while the pump is running. The relief valve setting should be below the {{maximum pressure}} rating that the piping, tubing, or any other components there could withstand.|$|E
50|$|All {{on-board}} active systems use extra fuel, {{whether through}} burning {{to heat the}} DPF, or providing extra power to the DPF's electrical system, although {{the use of a}} fuel borne catalyst reduces the energy required very significantly. Typically a computer monitors one or more sensors that measure back pressure and/or temperature, and based on pre-programmed set points the computer makes decisions on when to activate the regeneration cycle. The additional fuel can be supplied by a <b>metering</b> <b>pump.</b> Running the cycle too often while keeping the back pressure in the exhaust system low will result in high fuel consumption. Not running the regeneration cycle soon enough increases the risk of engine damage and/or uncontrolled regeneration (thermal runaway) and possible DPF failure.|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} avoid leakage at the packing or seal {{particularly}} when a liquid is dangerous, toxic, or noxious, diaphragm pumps are used for <b>metering.</b> Diaphragm <b>pumps</b> have a diaphragm through which repeated compression/decompression motion is transmitted. The liquid does not penetrate through the diaphragm, so the liquid inside the pump is sealed off from the outside. Such motion changes the volume of a chamber in the pump head so that liquid enters through an inlet check valve during decompression and exits through an outlet check valve during compression, {{in a manner similar}} to piston pumps. Diaphragm pumps can also be made which discharge at fairly high pressure. Diaphragm <b>metering</b> <b>pumps</b> are commonly hydraulically driven.|$|R

The once-through flow can either be intermittent or continuous.

50|$|Series 1 (2004-2008) RX-8 Renesis {{commonly}} {{suffer from}} engine failures between 80,000 and 120,000 miles due to premature apex seal wear from {{the lack of}} a center/middle oil injector which gets its oil from the oil <b>metering</b> <b>pump.</b> The rotor main bearing can also fail due to various problems like low oil pressure, and a lower viscosity oil was recommended in the North American market. The oil pan has a common problem of being crushed or bent during maintenance and can decrease the oil pickup tube flow causing main bearing failures as well. Modified Renesis engines can experience side seal failures due to a combination of exhaust back pressure and higher exhaust temperature. Overheating and heat expansion of housings can cause seals in the rotary engine to fail as well. Most of the issues can be circumvented by using a higher viscosity oil and adding 2 cycle oil to the gas.Flooding can occur in the RX-8 as in previous generations of rotary engine cars.|$|E
50|$|Liquid {{silicone}} rubbers are supplied in barrels. Because {{of their}} low viscosity, these rubbers can be pumped through pipelines and tubes to the vulcanization equipment. The two components are pumped through a static mixer by a <b>metering</b> <b>pump.</b> One {{of the components}} contains the catalyst, typically platinum based. A coloring paste {{as well as other}} additives can also be added before the material enters the static mixer section. In the static mixer the components are well mixed and are transferred to the cooled metering section of the injection molding machine. The static mixer renders a very homogeneous material that results in products that are not only very consistent throughout the part, but also from part to part. This is in contrast to solid silicone rubber materials that are purchased pre-mixed and partially vulcanized. In contrast, hard silicone rubbers are processed by transfer molding and result in less material consistency and control, leading to higher part variability. Additionally, solid silicone rubber materials are processed at higher temperatures and require longer vulcanization times.|$|E
