40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{feasibility}} and {{potential benefits of}} high frequency alternating current (HFAC) for vehicle auxiliary electrical systems. A 100 Vrms, 50 kHz sinusoidal AC bus is compared with 14 V DC and 42 V DC electrical systems in terms of mass and energy efficiency. The investigation {{is focused on the}} four main sub-systems of an on-board electrical network, namely: the power generation, power distribution, power conversion and the electrical loads. In addition, a systemlevel inquiry is conducted for the HFAC bus and a comparable 42 V DC system. A combination of computer simulation, analytical analysis and experimental work has highlighted benefits for the HFAC power distribution sub-system and for low-torque <b>motor</b> <b>actuators.</b> Specifically, the HFAC conductor mass is potentially 70 % and 30 % lighter than comparable 14 V DC and 42 V DC cables, respectively. Also, the proposed cable is expected to be at least 80 % more energy efficient than the current DC conductor technology. In addition, it was found that 400 Hz AC machines can successfully replace DC <b>motor</b> <b>actuators</b> with a rated torque of up to 2 Nm. The former are up to 100 % more efficient and approximately 60 % lighter and more compact than the existing DC motors in vehicles. However, it is argued that the HFAC supply is not feasible for high-torque <b>motor</b> <b>actuators.</b> This is because of the high energy losses and increased machine torque ripple {{associated with the use of}} HFAC power. The HFAC power conversion sub-system offers benefits in terms of simple power converter structure and efficient HFAC/DC converters. However, a significant limitation is the high power loss within HFAC/AC modules, which can be as high as 900 W for a 2. 4 kW load with continuous operation. Similar restrictions are highlighted for the HFAC power generation sub-system, where up to 400 W is lost in a 4 kW DC/HFAC power module. The conclusion of the present work is that the HFAC system offers mass and energy efficiency benefits for the conventional vehicle by leveraging the use of compact lowtorque <b>motor</b> <b>actuators</b> and lightweight wiring technology.

To maintain camshaft timing, the <b>actuator</b> <b>motor</b> will operate {{at the same speed}} as the camshaft. To advance the camshaft timing, the <b>actuator</b> <b>motor</b> will rotate slightly faster than the camshaft speed. To retard camshaft timing, the <b>actuator</b> <b>motor</b> will rotate slightly slower than camshaft speed. The speed difference between the <b>actuator</b> <b>motor</b> and camshaft timing is used to operate a mechanism that varies the camshaft timing. The benefit of the electric actuation is enhanced response and accuracy at low engine speeds and at lower temperatures as well as a greater total range of adjustment.

Examples of soft computing including neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic are widely applied {{in the field of}} robotic assembly, which is widely recognized as a complicated task in robotics. In order to achieve an intelligent robot, three issues should be considered in conjunction, namely, hardware design and robot model (fundamental), control algorithm (intermediate) and system integration (advanced).

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{transient}} analysis of flexible multibody systems within a hybrid finite element framework. Hybrid finite elements {{are based on a}} two-field variational formulation in which the displacements and stresses are interpolated separately yielding very good coarse mesh accuracy. Most of the literature on flexible multibody systems uses beam-theory-based formulations. In contrast, the use of hybrid finite elements uses continuum-based elements, thus avoiding the problems associated with rotational degrees of freedom. In particular, any given three-dimensional constitutive relations can be directly used within the framework of this formulation. Since the coarse mesh accuracy as compared to a conventional displacement-based formulation is very high, the scheme is cost effective as well. A general formulation is developed for the constrained motion of a given point on a line manifold, using a total Lagrangian method. The multipoint constraint equations are implemented using Lagrange multipliers. Various kinds of joints such as cylindrical, prismatic, and screw joints are implemented within this general framework. Hinge joints such as spherical, universal, and revolute joints are obtained simply by using shared nodes between the bodies. In addition to joints, the formulation and implementation details for a DC <b>motor</b> <b>actuator</b> and for prescribed relative rotation are also presented. Several example problems illustrate the efficacy of the developed formulation...|$|E
