40|$|Tubular hollow light guides {{are found}} in many {{lighting}} and daylighting systems to transport collected light into deep spaces of building interiors. Linear straight guides are popularly used due to their high optical efficiency, but non-linear guides with bent sections are sometimes required to fulfill some installation restrictions.

This article presents the development, validation, and application of an optical model to compute the transmittance of light guides with and without bends. The model {{is based on the}} ray-tracing technique and can handle segmented guides with connection elbows. Measurement of the light transmittance of a light guide with two connection elbows is conducted using an outdoor large integrating box to benchmark the model.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This project investigated the effect of PP skin on the PE core pipe in a PP/PE dual layer pipe during production and outdoor exposure under various radiation dosages {{by comparing the results}} with the corresponding uncoated pipe using different characterization techniques. It was found for unaged samples that after extrusion the adhesion reducer present in the PP skin migrated to the PE core pipe outer surface but had little effect on the electrofusion (EF) joint quality. The PP skin prevents the PE core pipe from quenching therefore more perfect PE crystal is formed as shown by a higher crystallinity and the residual stress is reduced as shown by a slit ring method. Due to the reduced residual stress, the skinned pipe had higher long term hydrostatic strength (LTHS) than the uncoated pipe. After outdoor weathering, photo-oxidation products were evident at the solar irradiated PP outer surface after 3 GJ/m 2 weathering and the whole PP outer surface was oxidized after 10 GJ/m 2 weathering. By deconvoluting the IR peaks, ketones, carboxylic acid and esters were found the main products. Although only slight photo-oxidation was identified after 10 GJ/m 2 aging on the uncoated PE pipe outer surface, oxidation induction time (OIT) results indicated that the solar irradiated side of the surface lost most of its antioxidants after only 1 GJ/m 2 weathering which led to production of weak layer in the EF joint. In the <b>middle</b> <b>pipe</b> wall and at the inner surface, a more gradual decrease of antioxidant was found. The skinned pipe showed better resistance to antioxidant loss than the uncoated pipe and still had adequate antioxidant for EF. The thermal effect of solar irradiation was thought to cause secondary crystallization of the uncoated pipe at the irradiated side and release of residual stress of both uncoated and skinned pipes after aging. The residual stress release rate was found to decline with weathering. As the pipe with thicker skin always had a lower residual stress, it can be inferred that the skinned pipe still had a higher LTHS value than the uncoated pipe even after aging...|$|E

The grid-sensitivity {{analysis was}} conducted on a tube with D_e= 250  mm and thickness th= 13.4  mm since it represents one of the largest processable pipe in terms of diameter and thickness and it is reasonably more affected by angular and radial thermal gradients than smaller pipes. In addition, three different operating conditions were considered: stationary pipe, rotating pipe with ω = 1.87 rad s^- 1 and pipe irradiated by a perfectly uniform radiation. Figure  4 shows the results of the grid-sensitivity analysis; in particular, the temperature of the monitored point in the three operating conditions at the end of the simulation and the total number of elements in the grid, N_El Tot, are reported. The case of rotating pipe represents the most critical one, showing grid independence for N_El OC> 500; thus, 500 has been subsequently chosen as the best value for N_El OC, since it was verified that it guaranteed grid independence for smaller pipes too.

50|$|The {{resonant}} {{frequencies of}} the air column in a pipe are inversely proportional to the pipe's effective length. In other words, a shorter pipe produces higher notes. For a pipe with no tone holes but open at both ends, the effective length is the physical length of the pipe plus a little more for the small volumes of air just beyond {{the ends of the}} pipe that are also involved in the resonance. An open hole anywhere along the <b>middle</b> of the <b>pipe</b> shortens the pipe's effective length and therefore raises the pitch of the notes it produces. The closer an open hole is to the blowing end, the shorter the remaining effective length is and the more it raises the pitch. Generally, a hole in a given position doesn't reduce the effective length quite as much as cutting the pipe at that position would, and the smaller the hole, the less it reduces the effective length when open. Closing the hole increases the effective length and lowers the pitch again. However, a pipe with a closed tone hole is not acoustically identical to a pipe with no hole; the shape of the fingertip or pad that closes the hole modifies the pipe's internal volume and effective length.|$|R

The metadynamic recrystallization (MDRX) kinetic models and grain size models of as-cast P 91 steel are established for the first time according to the hot compression tests performed on the Gleeble- 3500 thermal-simulation machine. Then a thermal-mechanical and micro-macro coupled hot extrusion finite element (FE) model is established and further developed in DEFORM software. The results indicated that the grain size of the extruded pipe increases with the increasing of initial temperature and extrusion speed, decreases when extrusion ratio increases. Moreover, the grain size is more sensitive to the initial temperature and the extrusion ratio. The optimum hot extrusion parameters are including that, the initial extrusion temperature of 1250  °C, the extrusion ratio of 9 and the extrusion speed of 50  mm/s.

Sub-Kolmogorov resolution is high enough to obtain reasonably accurate turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate, which is the essential quantity to clarify the turbulence modulation. Gaseous-phase shapes and behaviors were also taken by shape projection imaging (SPI). Experiments were conducted for two different bubble diameters of 1. 7 mm and 2. 6 mm. The void fraction, α, is set to be 0. 5 %, 1. 0 %, or 1. 5 %. The flow in a 44 mm diameter pipe is driven upward by a pump at the bulk velocity, Ub, of 200 mm/s, corresponding to a pipe Reynolds number, Re 2 R, of 9900. The mean flow profiles were flattened {{in the presence of}} bubbles because bubbles, which accumulated near the wall region, accelerated the liquid-phase fluid. The flattened mean flow profiles suppressed the shear-induced turbulence intensities in the <b>pipe</b> <b>middle</b> region, while the bubble wakes tends to augment turbulence intensity at high void fraction. TKE budget was calculated using the accurate form of dissipation rate introduced by Tanaka & Eaton (2007). The dissipation rate augmented as the void fraction increased.

Simulation shows 16 -electrode ECT system yields the highest potential {{at the center of the}} pipe 1. 74 ? 10 - 9 V, as compared to the 8 -electrode and 12 - electrode for maximum number of excitation, which is half of the total electrodes analysis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: From May 1968 through March 1980, vinyl-lined {{asbestos-cement}} (VL/AC) {{water distribution}} pipes were installed in New England to avoid taste and odor {{problems associated with}} asbestos-cement pipes. The vinyl resin {{was applied to the}} inner pipe surface in a solution of tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene, PCE). Substantial amounts of PCE remained in the liner and subsequently leached into public drinking water supplies. METHODS: Once aware of the leaching problem and prior to remediation (April-November 1980), Massachusetts regulators collected drinking water samples from VL/AC pipes to determine the extent and severity of the PCE contamination. This study compares newly obtained historical records of PCE concentrations in water samples (n = 88) with concentrations estimated using an exposure model employed in epidemiologic studies on the cancer risk associated with PCE-contaminated drinking water. The exposure model was developed by Webler and Brown to estimate the mass of PCE delivered to subjects' residences. RESULTS: The mean and median measured PCE concentrations in the water samples were 66 and 0. 5 μg/L, respectively, and the range extended from non-detectable to 2432 μg/L. The model-generated concentration estimates and water sample concentrations were moderately correlated (Spearman rank correlation coefficient = 0. 48, p < 0. 0001). Correlations were higher in samples taken at taps and spigots vs. hydrants (ρ = 0. 84 vs. 0. 34), in areas with simple vs. complex geometry (ρ = 0. 51 vs. 0. 38), and near pipes installed in 1973 – 1976 vs. other years (ρ = 0. 56 vs. 0. 42 for 1968 – 1972 and 0. 37 for 1977 – 1980). Overall, 24 % of the variance in measured PCE concentrations was explained by the model-generated concentration estimates (p < 0. 0001). Almost half of the water samples had undetectable concentrations of PCE. Undetectable levels were more common in areas with the earliest installed VL/AC pipes, at the beginning and <b>middle</b> of VL/AC <b>pipes,</b> at hydrants, and in complex pipe configurations. CONCLUSION: PCE concentration estimates generated using the Webler-Brown model were moderately correlated with measured water concentrations. The present analysis suggests that the exposure assessment process used in prior epidemiological studies could be improved with more accurate characterization of water flow. This study illustrates one method of validating an exposure model in an epidemiological study when historical measurements are not available.

In their most abstract form, pipelines are made up of pipes. These pipes can be tasks, processes, actions, etc. Each pipe has an input, a middle, and an output. The middle definition really depends on {{the context in which the}} pipeline exists. Figure 1. What is a pipe and what is a pipeline? For the moment, pretend the pipe is a real water pipe. This pipe might simply let water flow from one side to the other. Alternatively, the pipe could have a large funnel system at the input that actually collects fallen rain water, and on the output side there could be a bucket. Rain water would roll down the pipe and drip out of the other end into the bucket for collection. We would then define this pipe with a name and possibly a description; the name could be rain water pipe and our description a pipe that collects rainwater and drops it in a bucket. This is the most basic pipe [...] something with an input and an output that has something flowing through it. The middle always exists, but may not have a function. 1 Figure 2. Rain water pipe We could add a heated middle section to this rain water pipe, so as the rainwater rolls down the pipe it is gently heated. The addition of this feature makes it a different pipe, so we should rename it and change its description. With multiple pipes, it is possible to put them together in a preferred sequence to create new combinations. A series or sequence of pipes should also be named and described. Small pipes are made into small pipelines, which in turn can become part of larger and more complex pipelines. There are a few rules that make pipelines work: • Pipes must have an input and an output • Pipes can not loop on to themselves • Pipes should always be as simple as possible • The <b>middle</b> of a <b>pipe</b> can have multiple parts if necessary • Pipes can have conditions • The input, middle and output of a pipe can have parameters So what has all this got to do with the future of the web? If we change the context of our pipeline to a virtual pipeline (bearing in mind a pipeline is simply a sequence of tasks) we end up with a easily definable tasks that work like building blocks.
