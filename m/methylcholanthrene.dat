5000|$|<b>Methylcholanthrene</b> is {{a highly}} {{carcinogenic}} polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon produced by burning organic compounds at very high temperatures. <b>Methylcholanthrene</b> {{is also known as}} 3-methylcholanthrene, 20-methylcholanthrene or the IUPAC name 3-methyl-1,2-dyhydrobenzojaceanthrylene. The short notation often used is 3-MC or MCA. This compound forms pale yellow solid crystals when crystallized from benzene and ether. It has a melting point around 180 °C and its boiling point is around 280 °C at a pressure of 80 mmHg. [...] <b>Methylcholanthrene</b> is used in laboratory studies of chemical carcinogenesis. It is an alkylated derivative of benzaanthracene and has a similar UV spectrum. The most common isomer is 3-methylcholanthrene, although the methyl group can occur in other places.|$|E

Not many years later, {{it became clear that}} this compound had toxic properties to humans and animals. Therefore, a lot of interest was shown in the compound and it was used often in toxicological research. <b>Methylcholanthrene</b> is often tested on mice and rats to derive information for cancer medicine development. Due to the influence of the compound on the central nervous system, its responses and change in response are compared. It is also known that due to genetic mutations, the compound causes cancer cells to develop. In 1982, the last article appeared on the synthesis of <b>methylcholanthrene.</b> The yield of 93% was reached and therefore no further adjustments were made to the synthesis scheme.|$|E

In 1929 he discovered the first pure compound to show evidence of cancer-causing activity, 1:2:5:6-dibenzanthracene, and also discovered a series of other carcinogenic hydrocarbons including <b>methylcholanthrene.</b> In 1930, Kennaway and Izrael Hieger showed {{for the first time that}} single polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), such as dibenza,hanthracene, are tumorigenic in mouse skin.

50|$|<b>Methylcholanthrene</b> {{is often}} used to induce tumors in rodents for {{carcinogenesis}} and mutagenesis research. In a study from 1991, lung precancerous and cancerous lesions were induced in Wistar rats by one intrabronchial injection of 3-MC. After 30 days, atypical hyperplasia of bronchiolar epithelium, adenoid hyperplasia or adenomas, and squamous cell carcinoma occurred in 15 (88.2%), 12 (70.6%) and 3 (17.7%) out of 17 rats respectively. After 60 days, the incidences were 15/18 (83.3%), 4/17 (23.5%) and 7/18 (38.9%). All of the precancerous lesions and carcinomas showed positive expression of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT). Jin et al. (2013) found that the cellular redox balance is altered by acute exposure to 3-MC. This causes the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-regulated response pathway to induce antioxidant responses.|$|E
40|$|With {{the purpose}} {{investigating}} the possible relation between tissue distribution of <b>methylcholanthrene</b> and leukemogenesis, the author measured quantitatively tissue distribution and urinary excretion of <b>methylcholanthrene</b> after oral {{administration of the}} carcinogen. Ⅰ) Urinary excretion of methylcholanthrene: The average urinary excretion of <b>methylcholanthrene</b> at every 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 hours after one oral administration of 0. 8 % <b>methylcholanthrene</b> olive oil solution was 6. 32, 1. 95, 1. 15, 0. 823, 0. 415 and 0. 153 γ, respectively. Ⅱ) Tissue distribution of methylcholanthrene: 0. 15 cc of 0. 8 % <b>methylcholanthrene</b> olive oil solution was administrated orally three times a week. 1) In bone marrow, <b>methylcholanthrene</b> markedly accumulated in comparison mith other tissues from early time of administration. And in thymus and lymph nodes distribution of <b>methylcholanthrene</b> was clearly recognized from about 8 weeks of administration, {{but not so much}} as in bone marrow. 2) At 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks' repeated oral administration, the average <b>methylcholanthrene</b> in bone marrow was 41. 9, 67. 0, 108, 118 and 238 γ/g respectively. These figures show a tendency of <b>methylcholanthrene</b> accumulation in bone marrow from the second week. <b>Methylcholanthrene</b> in bone marrow increased in proportion to the number of its administration. 3) At 8 weeks' administration the carcinogen detected was 42. 1 γ/g in thymus, and 12. 4 γ/g in lymph nodes. At 12 weeks' administration its concentration was 83. 8 γ/g in thymus, and 38. 6 γ/g in lymph nodes. 4) Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation studies indicated a much higher concentration of <b>methylcholanthrene</b> in the nuclear fraction of liver and thymus.

To prove their point of view, Berenblum and Schoental showed that by increasing the concentration of <b>methylcholanthrene</b> (MCh) in lanolin the total tumour yield was "at least as great as in the control group " (treated with MCh or 9, 10 -dimethyl- 1, 2 -benzanthracene in benzene).

An analysis of one of these more widespread alterations is the basis for this communication. Materials and methods Mice of the NHO descent alone (without any outcross) have been used in this experiment. The origin of this strain has been described in previous publications. 1 - 12 Female No. 197, 062 and male 197, 063 were litter mates of the F 13 generation of the NHO descent. Their ancestry for nine generations had all been brown non-agouti (chart one). These nine generations of parents had produced 262 brown non-agouti mice in 52 litters, an average litter size of 5. 0 +mice.

40|$|Epithelial tumors {{have been}} readily {{obtained}} by the implantation of embryo stomach tissue together with olive oil containing <b>methylcholanthrene</b> (with or without Scharlach R) in adult mice of homologous strain. The implanted tissue from the squamous portion of the stomach rapidly encysted the oil, and benign and malignant papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas soon arose from the stratified squamous lining of the cysts. Bits of the glandular portion of the stomach also formed cysts, but the gland cells underwent metaplasia {{in response to the}} carcinogen, altering first to transitional epithelium and then to a stratified squamous layer. So swiftly did these changes take place that nearly all of the tumors took origin from epithelium that had already become stratified and squamous, and the growths themselves were of this type. A single transitional cell carcinoma and an adenoacanthoma were procured, but no adenocarcinomas; nor did any benign papillomas develop, though they often resulted from the action of <b>methylcholanthrene</b> on the squamous portion of the embryo stomach. Search failed to disclose any distinctive precancerous changes in the gastric tissue. Five of the cancers were transplanted and they grew in every host. No tumors arose from any of the numerous control implants.

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to learn whether the widely differing {{liabilities}} to induced epidermal tumors of individual mice and rabbits are due to a previous localization out of the blood of an agent capable of undergoing change when the skin is exposed to carcinogenic influences, and of producing tumors in consequence. On the assumption that such an agent would localize in increased quantity where cutaneous inflammation exists, like various inert substances of large molecule and the epidermotrophic viruses when circulating, skin areas on adult and new-born animals were for some weeks kept inflamed, and months later, when the areas appeared normal, <b>methylcholanthrene</b> was applied {{to them and to}} control areas on the same or other individuals. No differences were observable in tumor incidence. These results led to attempts to test whether embryo epidermis is capable of undergoing neoplastic change, and the work of Paper I was done which showed that epidermal tumors arise with great rapidity and regularity from embryo skin transplanted to adults of homologous strain (C strain) together with <b>methylcholanthrene.</b> Webster-Swiss mice proved unsuited to experiments of the sort owing to heterogeneity of the breed, the transplanted embryo skin dying in most instances before the <b>methylcholanthrene</b> introduced with it could have been carcinogenic. The skin of C 3 H embryos also did badly, as if from incompatibility in some instances but mostly because its epidermal cells proliferated less vigorously than those of C embryos and did not tolerate <b>methylcholanthrene</b> nearly so well. Despite these difficulties, epidermal tumors were occasionally induced, as also in the transplanted skin of Webster-Swiss embryos, and the growths appeared quite soon, all things considered. The effect of <b>methylcholanthrene</b> on the skin of sucklings, their mothers, and young adult mice of the C strain was studied in order to find out whether the rapid rate of neoplastic change in the transplanted epidermis of embryos is indicative of some liability connected with its period of development. The skin of new-born animals proved very refractory to the carcinogen, hair coming in {{at the same rate as}} on control litters and no perceptible inflammation occurring for about 2 weeks, although within this period the mothers of the treated animals and the young adults became hairless where the <b>methylcholanthrene</b> had been put and their skin was much inflamed. Later on, as the applications were kept up, similar changes took place in the sucklings, but none of these developed tumors during some 6 weeks of observation whereas growths appeared within 3 weeks on more than half of the mother mice and on some of the young adults. The failure to produce tumors in the sucklings seems to have been due to cutaneous conditions preventing the necessary exposure of the deeper epidermal cells to <b>methylcholanthrene.</b> In any projected correlation of age differences with the response of cells to carcinogens allowance must be made for such factors. The present findings give no ground for the supposition that embryo skin has any special liability to neoplastic change. The results of transferring the tumors derived from embryo epidermis to new hosts have made plain that the neoplastic state not infrequently entails disabilities which are crucial, the tumor cells failing to succeed unless aided. This holds true of some carcinomas as well as of papillomas. By transplanting pieces of the organs of C embryos together with <b>methylcholanthrene</b> tumors of many sorts besides the epidermal have been obtained. As yet only those of the stomach have been worked with extensively. They can be elicited as quickly and regularly as those of the epidermis and can be as easily transplanted. The findings as a whole render it impossible to suppose that the neoplastic potentialities possessed by transplanted embryo tissues are due to the lodgement in them of tumor-producing viruses as specialized in their effects as those now known, or of precursor agents conferring neoplastic liabilities specialized to the same degree. Some other possibilities are mentioned. The rarity of neoplasms at birth is due to the circumstances of intrauterine life and to its brevity, not to any lack of capacity of the cells of the embryo to undergo neoplastic change...|$|E

' PROCEDURE Whenever possible, at least one hundred mice of each sex of each of the fifteen strains were used (Table 1). The animals were accumulated slowly and the experiments extended over a period of two years (1942 - 45). One-tenth cc. of sesame oil containing 1 mg. of <b>methylcholanthrene</b> was injected into the right flank of all mice at the age of 60 ± 4 days. As a rule 5 to 8 mice were kept in a box and the sexes were separated in order to prevent breeding.

40|$|Benign and {{malignant}} tumors arise {{soon and}} with great regularity from the epidermis and the gastric epithelium of mouse embryos after fragments of these tissues have been implanted, together with <b>methylcholanthrene,</b> in the thigh muscles of adult animals of homologous strain (1 - 3). The present paper describes experiments, already reported in brief (2, 4), which were carried out with fetal lung. <b>Methylcholanthrene</b> induces remarkable changes in the transplanted pulmonary tissues, and tumors in wide variety quickly derive from it. Metkod and Materials The technique was essentially that already described (1, 3). For most of the tests mice of C strain {{have been used as}} previously, though some tests have been made with Webster-Swiss animals and those of the A breed. Embryos 18 days along, as determined by the vagirml plug method, were used in the main; they averaged 18 ram. in length. The youngest embryos employed were 15 days old (13 ram. long). The pulmonary tissue of smaller ones is difficult to procure in the necessary quantity without inclusion of the cells of other organs...|$|E
40|$|For {{over two}} decades geneticists have been {{interested}} in the possibility of inducing mutations with chemicals. Particularly, it has been hoped that mutagenic compounds might be discovered which, through their specificity of action, would lead to some understanding of the chemical basis of mutation, and ultimately of the structure and organization of the gene. The first clearly successful attempt to induce genetic changes chemically was described by Auerbach and Robson (1944), who produced mutations and chromosomal abberrations in Drosophila by exposing the flies to mustard gas and related compounds. More recently, Demerec (1947 and unpub.) has shown that certain carcinogenic hydrocarbons (1, 2, 5, 6 -dibenzanthracene, <b>methylcholanthrene,</b> beta naphthylamine, benzpyrene) are also effective in inducing mutations in Drosophila. These agents, like radiations, appear to be entirely nonspecific {{in the sense that the}} affected loci are distributed at random along the treated chromosomes. Nitrogen mustard has been shown to induce genetic alterations in Neurospora (Tatum, unpub.; Horowitz, Houlahan, Hungate and Wright, 1946), and in bacteria (Tatum, 1946; Bryson, unpub.), and at least one of the carcinogens, <b>methylcholanthrene,</b> is effective in Neurospora (Tatum, unpub.) ...|$|E
40|$|Litter seriation {{has been}} shown to {{influence}} the time (the latent period) at which a fibrosarcoma appears in mice following the subcutaneous injection of <b>methylcholanthrene.</b> ' This new principle is a variable one which apparently increases or decreases (in mice of certain strains) in a mother's body with advancing age and is handed down to her progeny by some means other than through the germ plasm (the mechanism of genes). This observation has been made on female mice which have not been injected with <b>methylcholanthrene</b> nor subjected to any other experimental procedure. They were mated to their normal litter-mate brothers. In the succeeding litters of mice of some strains, the average latent period for the appearance of chemically induced fibrosarcomas was gradually decreased and reached the lowest value in mice of the 7 th and 8 th litters. This increase of susceptibility to fibrosarcomas in successive litters is also variable in a second manner being more pronounced in mice of some strains (F 1, Brs X C 57 and Prunt) than in other strains (2 Prunt).

40|$|The benign tumors of rabbit skin {{which appear}} in {{response}} to benzpyrene and <b>methylcholanthrene</b> are {{nearly all of the}} same kinds that tar produces, namely frill horns, papillomas, and carcinomatoids; but the collateral effects of these agents render many of them very different from the tar tumors. The connective tissue of the corium is so slowly excited by the pure hydrocarbons that for a long while it furnishes to most of the growths only a scanty stroma, when any, and in consequence they remain small,—low, dry, indolent, bas-relief affairs, made up almost entirely of the neoplastic epithelium,—not florid, fleshy excrescences with a large connective tissue component, such as tarring calls forth. The frill horns usually desquamate instead of building up like those due to tar, and some of their cells undergo a dyskeratotic change with result in spherical, homogeneous, deep-staining bullet-like elements, which give to the growths a singular aspect. In a frill horn due to benzpyrene numerous inclusion bodies were come upon which would seem to have been the result of intercurrent infection with a "passenger virus. " Benzpyrene and <b>methylcholanthrene</b> produce papillomas, carcinomatoids, and frill horns in very different proportionate numbers from those obtaining when tar is the carcinogen. Tar gives rise much more frequently to carcinomatoids, —papillomas urged on to mimic cancers,—as would follow from its pronounced stimulating influence; yet it seldom produces frill horns whereas the pure hydrocarbons do so frequently. All three agents cause many more cells to become potentially capable of forming tumors than do so ordinarily, but the latent neoplastic elements on which tar exerts a promoting influence, causing them to form visible growths, are in general not the same as those which respond to benzpyrene and <b>methylcholanthrene.</b> Yet the relatively rare occurrence of frill horns due to tar cannot be wholly explained in this way and it becomes necessary to suppose that tar seldom changes normal cells into frill horn cells. Benzpyrene and <b>methylcholanthrene</b> give rise now and again to sebaceous adenomas, as tar does not. But tar does away with the sebaceous glands at an early period whereas the other two carcinogens cause them to increase notably in number. No evidence has been obtained that tar, benzpyrene, <b>methylcholanthrene,</b> arsenical preparations, or benzene,—which produces tumors of rabbit skin occasionally (1),—bring about any neoplastic changes peculiar to them individually when they act upon cells of a single sort, those of the stratum germinativum of rabbit epidermis. Yet the experimental findings make plain that these agents exert no inconsiderable influence on the morphology of the benign cutaneous growths they call forth and on the frequency with which this or that kind occurs. In appraising the action of carcinogens one must take into account not only the capacity of these agents to induce neoplastic change and to promote, or perhaps suppress, tumor growth but an ability to condition to no inconsiderable extent both the kind of tumor arising and its structure...|$|E
40|$|Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (EC 4. 1. 1. 37) {{activity}} was assayed in cultures of chick-embryo hepatocytes by {{the changes in}} composition of porphyrins accumulated after addition of excess 5 -aminolaevulinate. Control cells accumulated mainly protoporphyrin, whereas cells treated with 3, 4, 3 ', 4 '-tetrachlorobiphenyl or 2, 4, 5, 3 ', 4 '-pentabromobiphenyl accumulated mainly uroporphyrin, indicating decreased activity of the decarboxylase. 3 -Methylcholanthrene and other polycyclic-hydrocarbon inducers of the P- 448 isoenzyme of cytochrome P- 450, {{did not affect the}} decarboxylase {{in the absence of the}} biphenyls. Induction of P- 448 was detected as an increase in ethoxyresorufin de-ethylase activity. Pretreatment of cells with <b>methylcholanthrene</b> decreased the time required for the halogenated biphenyls to inhibit the decarboxylase. The dose response of <b>methylcholanthrene</b> showed that less than 40 % of the maximal induction of cytochrome P- 448 was needed to produce the maximum biphenyl-mediated inhibition of the decarboxylase. In contrast, induction of the cytochrome P- 450 isoenzyme by propylisopropylacetamide had no effect on the biphenyl-mediated decrease in decarboxylase activity. Use of inhibitors of the P- 450 and P- 448 isoenzymes (SKF- 525 A, piperonyl butoxide and ellipticine) supported the concept that only the P- 448 isoenzyme is involved in the inhibition of the decarboxylase by the halogenated biphenyls. The effect of preinduction with <b>methylcholanthrene</b> to enhance inhibition of the decarboxylase was also shown by the increased rate at which porphyrin accumulated from endogenously synthesized 5 -aminolaevulinate after treatment of cells with the combination of propylisopropylacetamide and the biphenyls. Antioxidants, chelators of iron, and chromate affected the decrease in decarboxylase activity only if they prevented the induced increase in cytochrome P- 448. We conclude that the P- 448 and not the P- 450 isoenzyme of cytochrome P- 450 plays an obligatory role in the inhibition of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase caused by halogenated biphenyls...|$|E
