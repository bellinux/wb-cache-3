[...] The VOC Solvents Emissions Directive is the main policy instrument for the reduction of industrial emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the European Union. It covers a wide range of solvent using activities, e.g. printing, surface cleaning, vehicle coating, dry cleaning and <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>footwear</b> and pharmaceutical products. The VOC Solvents Emissions Directive requires installations in which such activities are applied to comply either with the emission limit values set out in the Directive or with the requirements of the so-called reduction scheme. Article 13 of The Paints Directive, approved in 2004, amended the original VOC Solvents Emissions Directive and limits the use of organic solvents in decorative paints and varnishes and in vehicle finishing products. The Paints Directive sets out maximum VOC content limit values for paints and varnishes in certain applications.|$|E
50|$|When {{the company}} was first formed it was to make sole and heel cutting knives for the local {{footwear}} industry. Within a few years this diversified into {{a wide range of}} machinery for industry, as well as the first refrigeration plant for the Smithfield meat market in London. Around 1897 the part of the business devoted to the footwear industry was sold off to the British United Shoe Machinery Co, and the business directed its efforts more towards printing, grinding, and knitwear machines. However, by 1903 they made their first internal combustion petrol engines and petrol-paraffin engines, and gradually engine manufacture was to become their main business. However, William Henry Dorman was a prolific inventor and between 1894 and 1914 there are 72 patents to his name, many related to the mechanisation of the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>footwear,</b> but also on diverse topics such as the trouser press, four-wheel-drive motor cars, and a method for separating cream from milk.

Previous research studying wrinkles focused mostly on cloth modeling or in animations, which are driven more by visual realism, but allow large elastic deformations. Our operators generate wrinkle-shaped deformations in a region of a smooth surface along a given boundary based on a few basic parametric inputs such as wrinkle magnitude and extent (these terms will be defined in the paper). The essential geometric transformation to map the smooth surface to a wrinkled one will be defined purely in terms of the geometry of the surface and the input parameters. Our model is based on two surface properties: geodesic offsets and surface energy. Practical implementation of the operators is discussed, and examples presented.

30|$|For the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>footwear</b> it is {{necessary}} {{to take into account the}} following operating procedures: modeling, cutting, uppering, assembly, finishing and packaging. For the preparation of this work the most demanding adhesive joint was considered. The joint described in this paper is part of the assembly procedure, which adjusts the upper to the form of the shoe and proceeds to glue it to the sole. The selection of these materials will vary, depending on its mechanical properties, price and intended design, thereby determining the strength, quality and comfort desired for the final product. The upper can be on natural or synthetic leather, woven or polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The soles may be of synthetic rubber, natural rubber (NR) or leather. Synthetic rubbers commonly used in the manufacture of this component for the construction of the shoe are based on polyurethane (PU), thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), thermoplastic rubber (TR), styrene butadiene rubber (SBR), ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA), polyamide (PA), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS) or acrylonitrile butyl styrene (ABS) [2].|$|E

It wiped out Candee's fortune he had accumulated over a period of twenty-five years. Candee then started manufacturing elastic suspenders. He became interested in rubber and rubber products. In the same year of his previous business failure he started to manufacture rubber footwear. Charles Goodyear offered Candee a license to use the rubber vulcanization process he had just discovered.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the effect of foreign outsourcing, focusing on CEE countries and especially on Turkey, on the level of employment for Spain. The rising economic integration has increased not only trade in final goods but also the flows of intermediate goods, as a result of the fragmentation of production by multinational firms and/or the search for new and cheaper providers. While some see this phenomenon as a threat to domestic employment, it also represents a chance to reduce costs, increase flexibility and open new markets, all of which can raise sales and employment. We study empirically this impact for Spain, a country that joined the EEC in 1986, becoming a low-cost location for many firms, and after twenty-years of development it is now experiencing a strong increase of outsourcing to Central and Eastern European countries with a specific analysis of the case of Turkey. The trade relationship between Turkey and Spain has been reinforced significantly in the last years and has concentrated in a few sectors, with important relative increase in imports from particular sectors as Agriculture, Textile, Leather goods, <b>Manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>footwear,</b> Manufacture of cork and wood, Manufacture of articles of paper and cardboard, Manufacture of rubber and plastic products...|$|E

All 382 cases of cancers of the sinonasal cavities diagnosed between 1970 and 1984 and kept on file in this data linkage system were analysed using standardised proportional incidence ratios (SPIR) to screen for industrial high risk areas for these malignancies in Denmark. Excess risks were confirmed among men and women employed in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>footwear</b> and other leather products and of wooden furniture. No risk significantly above expectancy was observed among wood workers outside the furniture making industry. Excess risks were also seen among men in all areas of basic metal industries (SPIR = 184 - 562) and in a subset of workers in industries producing metal containers (SPIR = 329 - 600). Most unexpected were raised risks among employees of both sexes in making cocoa, chocolate, and sugar confectionery (SPIR = 535 for men and 860 for women); these, in combination with the observed risks among female employees in canning and preserving fruits and vegetables (SPIR = 778) and in farming (SPIR = 735) may point to a common aetiology. The obscuring effect of mass significance may, however, be another explanation. The new associations discovered in this large scale linkage study must therefore await further confirmation...|$|E

During the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>footwear,</b> {{are generated}} {{various types of}} waste, including the Ethylene Vinyl Acetat (EVA), as inevitable patchwork of expanded boards of the material to obtain the shoe formats. An alternative to an appropriate destination of EVA waste is its use {{in the manufacture of}} blocks produced with lightweight concrete. The issue addressed in this study is related to the thermal gains made by vertical sealing and thermal comfort of built environments. The environments that do not have the appropriate type of masonry to its climate generate thermal comfort problems due to loss, or excessive heat gain, what happens in regions with predominantly hot dry weather wet hot, as is the case of Northeast Brazil. Considering the thermal discomfort of environments due to misuse elements appropriate in the walls of buildings, as well as the problem of disposal of waste EVA, this work is to extend the characterization of the thermal performance of the blocks composed of EVA. Therefore, we sought to analyze compared samples developed from EVA blocks with other components. The study was done from the development of miniature single skin and double samples (made of EVA blocks, ceramic bricks and concrete blocks), which were tested in a thermal chamber composed of two rooms, a heated and another cooled, separated by an insulating partition in which the sample was inserted. The instrumentation was performed with the use of thermocouples installed in the walls and surfaces of the mini black globe thermometers in the chamber environment. From the experimental characterization of thermophysical properties such as thermal conductivity and density of the EVA blocks of various parameters calculations were performed as set out in NBR 15220 - 2 (ABNT, 2005 b) and calculations to obtain the heat transfer rate of samples.
