5|$|A.V. Roe Canada Limited {{had been}} set up as a {{subsidiary}} of the Hawker Siddeley Group in 1945, initially handling repair and maintenance work for aircraft at <b>Malton,</b> Ontario Airport, today known as Toronto Pearson International Airport. The next year the company began the design of Canada's first jet fighter for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), the Avro CF-100 Canuck all-weather interceptor. The Canuck underwent a lengthy and troubled prototype stage before entering service seven years later in 1953. Nevertheless, it went on {{to become one of the}} most enduring aircraft of its class, serving in a variety of roles until 1981.|$|E
5|$|Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust {{provides}} hospitals at Castle Hill Hospital, Hull Royal Infirmary and Beverley Westwood Hospital. Scarborough and North East Yorkshire Healthcare NHS Trust runs Bridlington Hospital {{and also}} provides health care {{from the community}} hospitals at Driffield and <b>Malton</b> which are run by the local primary care trusts (NHS East Riding and NHS North Yorkshire and York). Small cottage and community hospitals provide a range of services at Hornsea and Withernsea.|$|E
5|$|The 18th and 19thcenturies saw {{first the}} {{expansion}} of canals and then the construction of rail links. The River Derwent was canalised as far upstream as <b>Malton</b> and was linked to Pocklington by the cutting of the Pocklington Canal. Other canals were cut to join the towns of Beverley and Driffield to the River Hull, which was also improved to aid navigation. The Market Weighton Canal connected the town directly to the Humber Estuary. An early rail link was constructed between Filey and Bridlington in 1847 and the <b>Malton</b> to Driffield railway {{was the first to}} cross the Wolds in 1853. These routes primarily served the agricultural community in helping to get their products to the expanding industrial markets in the West Riding of Yorkshire and to the port of Hull for export. The rail links served also to transport holidaymakers to the expanding coastal resorts of Bridlington, Hornsea and Withernsea. The canals and canalisation of some of the rivers helped to aid drainage in such of the low-lying ill-drained areas that then still existed. The landscape in the East Riding had changed little since the enclosure of the open fields in the 18th and 19thcenturies, except for the removal of some hedgerows to allow for the use of large agricultural machinery in the 20thcentury.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortification}} of Castle Rising {{was constructed}} in a carefully designed landscape. In front of the castle was the town of Castle Rising, moved to its new site when the castle was built. The settlement {{appears to have been}} laid out to a grid-plan design, possibly bounded by ditches; with the castle positioned just behind it, in a similar fashion to that at New Buckenham and <b>Malton</b> Castle. A dovecot and a religious house were founded nearby; both of these were important symbols of lordship at the time, and were considered essential parts of a properly established castle.|$|E
5|$|Brooks {{trained in}} Brandon, Manitoba through October {{prior to being}} sent to a Winnipeg {{equipment}} depot {{to serve as a}} guard. He then undertook several training phases across the country in Regina, Saskatchewan, London, Toronto, <b>Malton,</b> and Fingal, Ontario, and finally Rivers, Manitoba, prior to graduating in August 1941 as a Navigator - Bomb Aimer. Arriving in Britain at the end of September, he was sent to RAF Kinloss the following month and trained there until February 1942, when he joined the RCAF's 419 Bomber Squadron. On April 8–9, during only his second mission, he was shot down during a bombing raid and landed near Oldenburg, Germany, where he was quickly taken as a prisoner of war and sent to Dulag Luft.|$|E
5|$|Lody {{described}} anti-Zeppelin precautions he {{had heard}} about in London and provided details of the conversions of the Cunard Line steamships RMS Aquitania and Lusitania for their wartime service, which he had seen while in Liverpool. Once again the letter was intercepted by the British and not allowed to go forward to Stockholm. Lody and Lee spent another evening in Dublin before going on a day-trip by coach to Glendalough to see the lough and the surrounding countryside. On 2 October they parted with an agreement to meet again in Killarney the following day. Lee travelled to Drogheda, where he stayed overnight, while Lody went straight to Killarney and found {{a room at the}} Great Southern Hotel (now the <b>Malton</b> Hotel).|$|E
5|$|Train {{operators}} {{active in}} the area are Northern, Virgin Trains East Coast and TransPennine Express. Hull Trains is an 'open access' operator established in 2002 running fast services between London and Hull. Bus services are provided by several operators including FirstGroup, which provides services from the East Riding into York, Goole Town Service and also services from Goole to Doncaster. Stagecoach provides services from the East Riding to Hull and into Lincolnshire, and East Yorkshire Motor Services, historically the dominant area operator, provides a wide variety of bus services throughout the East Riding. Yorkshire Coastliner provides services from Bridlington to <b>Malton,</b> York and Leeds. Holderness Area Rural Transport, a charity, provides a community transport service for North Holderness, taking people to medical appointments in Hull and to the shops.|$|E
5|$|After invading Britain in 43AD the Romans {{crossed the}} Humber Estuary in 71AD {{to invade the}} Northumbrian {{territory}} of the Parisi tribe. From their bridgehead at Petuaria they travelled northwards and built roads along the Wolds to Derventio, present day <b>Malton,</b> and then westwards to the River Ouse where they built the fort of Eboracum. There is evidence of extensive use of the light soils of the Wolds for grain farming in the Roman era. Several Roman villas which were the centres of large agricultural estates have been identified around Langton and Rudston. In the low-lying lands {{on either side of}} the Wolds there was an increase in the number of settlements between 500BC and 500AD as the land became drier and more accessible due to a fall in sea level. The lower-lying land was used for stock breeding. During the last years of Roman occupation Anglo-Saxon raiders were troubling the area and, by the second half of the 5thcentury, settlement by Anglian invaders was taking place in east Yorkshire. Village names containing the elements -ing, -ingham or -ham are Anglian settlement names. As Christianity became established in the area from the 7thcentury onwards, several cemeteries like the one at Garton on the Wolds show evidence of the abandonment of pagan burial practices. In 867AD the Great Danish Army captured the Anglian town of York, and the remnants of the army settled in Yorkshire from 876AD when their leader Halfdan shared out the land among them. Scandinavian settlements have names including the elements -by and -thorpe. Scandinavian rule in the area came to an end in 954AD with the death of their ruler Eric Bloodaxe.|$|E
25|$|In parallel, the Harbour Commission built <b>Malton</b> Airport airfield, {{and opened}} it in 1939. Before its completion, Toronto City Council made {{arrangements}} for the Government of Canada {{to take over the}} field, which was christened Bishop Field (to honour the same flying ace for which the island airport was later renamed after) in 1939. The <b>Malton</b> field was intended to be used for training, as the centre for the trans-Canada air system, and used when visibility was poor at the island. Trans-Canada Airlines inaugurated passenger service at <b>Malton</b> and ultimately rejected the island airport due to its short runways. <b>Malton</b> ultimately became Toronto's main airport instead of the island airport.|$|E
25|$|The {{community}} of <b>Malton,</b> which contains {{a significant number}} of Sikhs, holds its annual Khalsa Day parade, marching between Sri Guru Singh Sabha (<b>Malton</b> Gurdwara) and Sikh Spiritual Centre (Rexdale Gurdwara Sahib) in Toronto. This parade is attended by 100,000 people.|$|E
25|$|On February 2, 1959, RCAF Station Trenton {{became the}} {{destination}} for CF-105 Arrow 25204, flying from the Avro Canada manufacturing facility at <b>Malton</b> Airport. A Trans-Canada Air Lines Vickers Viscount had crash landed during 25204's flight, temporarily closing the runways at <b>Malton.</b>|$|E

25|$|Until the 2010 general {{election}} Pickering {{was in the}} Ryedale constituency but due to boundary changes {{was moved to the}} new Thirsk and <b>Malton</b> constituency.|$|E
25|$|The UKIP {{candidate}} for Thirsk and <b>Malton</b> — John Boakes – died, causing {{the election in}} the constituency to be postponed until 27 May.|$|E
25|$|The Toronto Flying Club {{moved to}} the Island from <b>Malton</b> in 1960 and this caused a large {{increase}} in traffic. For 1961, the airport recorded 212,735 movements, of which 168,272 were for local traffic, including student flights. By number of movements, this made the airport the busiest in Canada. However, the cost of operating at the Island airport forced the Club to close and sell off its 12 planes after less than a year. It would resurrect itself at <b>Malton</b> two years later in 1963.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP) {{operated}} No. 1 Elementary Service Flying School (EFTS) and No. 1 Air Observer School (AOS) at <b>Malton</b> Airport.|$|E
25|$|It {{includes}} the neighbourhoods of Colerane, Ebenezer, Woodhill, Bramalea and Gorewood Acres in the City of Brampton and the neighbourhoods of <b>Malton,</b> Marvin Heights and Ridgewood in the City of Mississauga.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, the Government of Canada {{agreed to}} support the {{building}} of two airports for Toronto, Ontario. One site was downtown, today's Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport. The other was to be outside the city, intended as a backup for the downtown airport. A site on a ghost-town called Elmbank {{near the town of}} <b>Malton,</b> northwest of Toronto, was chosen and the Toronto Harbour Commission purchased and acquired several farms to provide the land for the airfield. The first scheduled passenger flight for the new <b>Malton</b> Airport was a Trans-Canada Air Lines DC-3 that landed on August 29, 1939.|$|E
25|$|The Derwent {{crosses the}} Vale of Pickering flowing westwards, turns southwards at <b>Malton</b> and {{flows through the}} eastern part of the Vale of York before {{emptying}} into the River Ouse at Barmby on the Marsh.|$|E
25|$|Burke, however, {{was very}} pleased. He wrote to Fitzwilliam on 21 June to give {{notice that he}} {{intended}} to resign his seat in the Commons. Fitzwilliam offered Burke's seat of <b>Malton</b> to his son Richard, who accepted.|$|E
25|$|The tourist venues of Pickering Parish Church, {{with its}} medieval wall paintings, Pickering Castle, the North Yorkshire Moors Railway and Beck Isle Museum have made Pickering popular with visitors. Nearby places include <b>Malton,</b> Norton and Scarborough.|$|E
25|$|The year {{closed off}} with the Cricket Canada summer festival taking place at <b>Malton</b> Cricket Club. A strong West Indies High Performance Team (containing players with test and ODI players) split their matches with Canada in two hard-fought contests.|$|E
25|$|Some {{heritage}} rail operations continue along Network Rail {{tracks to}} Whitby. The railway is formed {{from the middle}} section of the former Whitby, Pickering and <b>Malton</b> Line which was closed in 1965 {{as part of the}} Beeching cuts.|$|E
25|$|On 27 May 2010 the Conservatives won {{the final}} seat of Thirsk and <b>Malton</b> in a {{landslide}} result, thus giving them 306 seats. The election in that constituency had been delayed because {{of the death of}} the UKIP candidate.|$|E
25|$|This {{support for}} unpopular causes, notably free trade with Ireland and Catholic Emancipation, led to Burke losing {{his seat in}} 1780. For the {{remainder}} of his parliamentary career, Burke represented <b>Malton,</b> another pocket borough under the Marquess of Rockingham's patronage.|$|E
25|$|The Vale of Pickering is a {{drainage}} basin for the surrounding hills. At {{the eastern end}} of the area the canalised and straightened River Hertford drains west into the Derwent, which rises on the North York Moors a few miles from Scarborough before draining southwards into the vale. At {{the western part of the}} area the River Rye and its numerous tributaries flow eastwards and join the Derwent to the north of <b>Malton.</b> The Derwent then flows southwards through <b>Malton</b> and the Kirkham gorge to eventually join the River Ouse at Barmby on the Marsh. Many of the watercourses in the Vale are maintained by the three Vale of Pickering internal drainage boards which are the Rye IDB, Thornton IDB and Muston & Yedingham IDB.|$|E
25|$|In 1945, Hawker Siddeley Group {{purchased}} the former Victory Aircraft firm in <b>Malton,</b> Ontario, and renamed the operation A.V. Roe Canada Limited. Commonly known as Avro Canada, {{it was actually}} a subsidiary of the Hawker Siddeley Group and used the Avro name for trading purposes.|$|E
25|$|Conceived in the 1930s as {{the main}} airport for Toronto, the {{construction}} of the airport was completed in 1939 by the Toronto Harbour Commission (THC). At the same time, the THC built <b>Malton</b> Airport as an alternate, but nearby <b>Malton</b> (today Toronto Pearson International Airport) became Toronto's main passenger airline hub instead, leaving the island airport for general aviation and military purposes. During the 1940s and 1950s, several political leaders proposed an expansion of the island airport to enable scheduled passenger airlines and reduce the annual operating costs. <b>Malton</b> was sold in 1962 to the Government of Canada in exchange for an expansion and improvements to the island airport. After the expansion, civil flights increased to a peak of over 200,000 annual flights in the 1960s. Although regional airlines were introduced in the 1970s, the annual number of flights went into decline and closure was discussed. In 1983, a 50-year tripartite agreement between the governments of Canada, City of Toronto and the Harbour Commission, which limited noise and banned jet use for scheduled airlines, allowed airport operations to continue. In the 1990s, in an era of government cost-cutting, questions about the airport's future were raised again due to its annual deficit. At the same time, redevelopment was taking over north of the airport and several studies suggested that the airport was incompatible with development.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} villages (and some later incorporated towns) settled included: Lakeview, Clarkson, Cooksville, Dixie, Erindale (called Springfield until 1890), Lorne Park, Port Credit, Sheridan and Summerville. This region {{would become}} known as Toronto Township. Part of northeast Mississauga, including the Airport lands and <b>Malton</b> were part of Toronto Gore Township.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, Toronto built <b>Malton</b> Airport as a {{secondary}} air field, {{but it was}} <b>Malton</b> that became Toronto's main airport. This fact meant that the island airport became used mainly for general civil aviation and lost money on its operations. During the 1940s and 1950s, several political leaders proposed {{the expansion of the}} airport as a way to enable scheduled passenger airlines and reduce the airport deficits. An expansion of runways and facilities was completed in 1962, financed by the sale of <b>Malton</b> Airport to the Government of Canada. Despite the improvements, the island airport did not become a passenger airline hub, and its existence came into question, starting in the 1960s. In 1968, the site was proposed for a large housing development known as 'Harbor City.' In the 1970s, as part of a debate around airports serving Toronto, the airport became the focus of efforts to set up a network of airports in Canada serving Short-Take-Off-And-Landing (STOL) regional airlines. From a peak of over 200,000 annual flights in the 1960s, the island airport went into decline even as several regional airlines operated at the airport from the 1970s onwards. The annual operating deficit forced its operator, the Toronto Harbour Commission (THC) to sell land to pay the ongoing deficit and by the 1990s, the airport was again facing questions about its continued existence.|$|E
25|$|Each of {{the market}} towns within the Ryedale District has areas set aside for {{industrial}} use and small firms engaged in light industry and the service industries occupy these. The largest employer in the district is the <b>Malton</b> Bacon Factory, employing more than 2,000 people. Other businesses generally employ less than 25 people.|$|E
