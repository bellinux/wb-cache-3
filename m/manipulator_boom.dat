40|$|Information {{backing up}} the key {{features}} of the manipulator system concept and detailed technical information on the subsystems are presented. Space station assembly and shuttle cargo handling tasks are emphasized in the concept analysis because they involve shuttle berthing, transferring the <b>manipulator</b> <b>boom</b> between shuttle and station, station assembly, and cargo handling. Emphasis is also placed on maximizing commonality in the system areas of manipulator booms, general purpose end effectors, control and display, data processing, telemetry, dedicated computers, and control station design...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: the {{manipulating}} robots, the elastic rod mechanical systems. The {{purpose of the}} work: the development of methods and algorithms of design of the dynamics, optimization of the constructive parameters and laws of control by {{the movement of the}} manipulating robots with the distributed links elasticity, dynamics of the electromechanical drives and inertiality of the movable loads accounted for. Developed have been the methods of constructing the control, displacing the elastic manipulator from the initial state to the final position, of the combined optimization of the constructive parameters and laws of control by the elastic manipulator movement have been developed. Developed has been the method of disturbances in the problem of the solid body motion along the elastic rod. The algorithmic and program support intended for the design of the dynamics, optimization of the construction and the laws of control by the movement of the manipulating robots has been developed. Offered have been the precision control modes by the <b>manipulator</b> <b>boom</b> movement, essentially exceeding the precision of positioning, the optimum linear sizes of the robot boom UNIVERSAL- 5 have been foundAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|A {{conceptual}} design and program plan for an Orbital Construction Demonstration Article (OCDA), {{that can be}} used for technology growth and verification, and as the construction facility for a variety of large structures is presented. The OCDA design includes a large work platform, a rotating <b>manipulator</b> <b>boom,</b> a 250 kw solar array, and a core module of subsystems with a total mass of 37, 093 kg, that can be assembled in three shuttle flights. An analysis of OCDA continued utility potential indicates that a shuttle tended platform with 250 kW of power can effectively be used to construct highly beneficial antenna systems and large demonstration articles that advance solar power satellite technologies. The construction of 100 m parabolic reflectors for use as a radiometer for measuring soil moisture and water salinity was found to be within the capabilities of OCDA concept. With 252 fixed beams for high population centers, and 16 scanning beams for rural areas, the antenna has the potential to significantly improve U. S. space based communications systems. The OCDA, that is slightly increased in size, was found adequate to build a large 2 MW solar array which, when coupled to a transmit antenna, demonstrate power transfer from space to ground...|$|E
40|$|The {{trend of}} {{teleoperator}} development is toward digital computer controlled systems which utilize local sensor-computer-actuator loops to avoid obstacles and to sense manipulator grip-and-slip. The potential applications of advanced teleoperator technology to manned aerospace systems include long <b>manipulator</b> <b>booms</b> to be {{mounted on the}} shuttle. These can transfer cargo from the space shuttle and can acquire and retrieve objects in space. Free-flying teleoperators capable of acquiring, inspecting, repairing or refurbishing satellites in orbit are another space application. Another potential application of teleoperator technology {{is the concept of}} using an anthropomorphous teleoperator in lieu of man to control aircraft or spacecraft normally controlled by a human pilot...|$|R
40|$|A major {{subsystem}} {{aboard the}} Shuttle Orbiter, the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) provides {{the capability to}} deploy and retrieve free-flying satellites, support attached payload operations, and aid in crewmember rescue from a disabled vehicle should the requirement arise. The Remote Manipulator System consists of 15. 3 -m (50 ft) articulated booms, end effectors, operator workstation, and closed circuit video, power and control subsystems. The <b>manipulator</b> <b>booms</b> (or arms) and end effectors {{are located in the}} Orbiter payload bay and operated from inside the cabin by one crewmember. This paper is primarily concerned with the design and development of the RMS operator's workstation, the man-machine engineering features and interfaces, and man-in-the-loop simulations and testing results obtained to date by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) ...|$|R
40|$|Unit {{programs}} {{thermal cycle}} from 100 to 2, 300 F for firing ceramic gglaze coatings on refractory surfaces in any attitude and position. Device includes control console, heater assembly, protective cover, and <b>manipulator</b> boom; <b>boom</b> places heater next to surface to be fired. Unit is industrially useful for in situ repair of ceramics and curing individual refractory blocks during furnace maintenance...|$|R
40|$|The {{preliminary}} {{design of a}} Shuttle-Attached Manipulator System is based on two arms that are articulated at shoulder, elbow, and wrist. Details of manipulator design are considered, giving attention to arm reach, velocity, acceleration, torque, joint angular travel limits, control, crew systems and man-machine interface, and telecommunications. The results of man-in-the-loop simulations show the feasibility of grappling a representative space payload from the Shuttle using a long <b>boom</b> <b>manipulator</b> system. The task, however, is sufficiently difficult to require the full concentration of one operator who should be relieved of any other tasks while performing operations with the manipulator system...|$|R
50|$|In {{industrial}} ergonomics a manipulator is a {{lift assist device}} used to help workers lift, maneuver {{and place}} articles in process that are too heavy, too hot, too large or otherwise too difficult for a single worker to manually handle. As opposed to simply vertical lift assists (cranes, hoists, etc.) manipulators {{have the ability to}} reach in to tight spaces and remove workpieces. A good example would be removing large stamped parts from a press and placing them in a rack or similar dunnage. In welding, a column <b>boom</b> <b>manipulator</b> is used to increase deposition rates, reduce human error and other costs in a manufacturing setting.|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} estimate is presented {{of the resources}} required to develop the basic general purpose walking <b>boom</b> <b>manipulator</b> system. It is assumed that the necessary full scale zero g test facilities will be available on a no cost basis. A four year development effort is also assumed and it is phased with an estimated shuttle development program since the shuttle will be developed prior to the space station. Based on delivery of one qualification unit and one flight unit and without including any ground support equipment or flight test support it is estimated (within approximately + or - 25 %) that a total of 3551 man months of effort and $ 17, 387, 000 are required...|$|R
