However, no clear relationship was found between explanatory variables and financial performance measures such as operating profit on sales and net profit on sales. In terms of strength of the relationship, the number of years a subsidiary has been in operation was found to have a consistently positive and significant relationship with the export to sales ratios in the three manufacturing industries examined. In light of the major findings, an important aspect is that since the characteristics of subsidiaries may affect performance in different (sometimes opposite) ways, policymakers should establish and implement foreign direct investment policies in a differentiated and targeted manner.

40|$|This paper {{proposed}} a new index called traffic incident <b>management</b> <b>ratio</b> (TIMR) for identifying appropriate roads {{to be installed}} with traffic incident management system. The TIMR {{is defined as the}} ratio between the expected total travel costs of the degradable transport network without and with traffic incident management programme (TIMP). The traffic flow pattern under the degradation network without TIMP is assumed to follow User Equilibrium (UE) condition, whereas the system optimum (SO) assignment is used to characterise the degradable network condition controlled by TIMP. The main function of TIMP considered in this paper is re-routing of traffic after the Incident. An optimisation programme Is then proposed for identifying critical roads in the network for an installation of TIMP. The critical roads for TIMP is identified by maximising the TIMR which implies that incidents on these critical roads can significantly increase the total network travel time without TIMP in which the installation of TIMP on these links can decrease the impacts significantly. The proposed model can also quantify the critical level of link capacity degradation. The model and algorithm are tested with a network to illustrate the application of the proposed model.

40|$|Regional form of Organization of {{the health}} care that are called today DyPE, have as a main goal to promote more {{rational}} resource allocation through decentralization in the decision making process. The concern for more effective and efficient use of resources devoted into the health care sector renders hospitals a critical vehicle of the quest for superior economic performance, especially if we take into our consideration their mounting over time deficits. Economic performance is primarily traced through a set of specific financial ratios, which embrace important elements that constitute the substance of the financial well-being of hospitals as economic units. An array of financial ratios is critically reviewed and a combination of them is proposed as a means of effective financial management. The later is necessary to ameliorate the funding strain imposed on the health care system and especially on hospitals. The financial performance is determined by the return on capital (profitability) in connection with the risk involved. Both factors determine the value created, which in turn affects the amount of financing attracted in the sector. The financial information available to the supervising regional bodies (DyPE), don’t considered sufficient for their management to assess financial management of hospitals effectively. The lack of the appropriate economic data {{is due to the fact}} that double entry accounting has not yet fully adopted by the economic units that report to the corresponding DyPE.

Findings – Overall, the extent of financial ratio disclosures is very low (5. 3 per cent) with more extensive disclosures within the sub-categories of share market measure, profitability and capital structure. A far lower liquidity and cash flow ratio information is reported. Larger firms with more dispersed share ownership provide more extensive financial ratio information than the others. Further, profit-making firms and Big 4 clients exhibit more extensive financial ratio disclosures.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of customer satisfaction on economic success considering as an example the organic food retail trade. In addition, the influence of customer satisfaction on customer loyalty is examined. The study is based on 885 customer interviews and an analysis of <b>management</b> <b>ratios</b> of 11 organic food shops. The results show that customer satisfaction is a relevant key to economic success. Regression analysis results show, that some 45 % of sales per m² {{can be explained by}} the overall satisfaction of customers. The collateral inquiry of customer and shop data allows the confirmation of an essential economic effect. A further analysis identifies the quality of goods, information and service, the atmosphere, the price-performance ratio and the trust in employees as main determinants of customer satisfaction. In a second step the influence of customer satisfaction on the willingness to change shops is analysed. The results of an online survey among 170 customers show that customer satisfaction and commitment are necessary preconditions for the economic success of small organic food shops, but they are not sufficient to explain customer loyalty...|$|R

In the corporate world, managers can display financial intelligence by speaking the language, that is, asking questions about the numbers when something doesn't make sense, reviewing financial reports and using the information to understand the company's strengths and weaknesses, using ROI analysis, working capital <b>management,</b> and <b>ratio</b> analysis to make decisions, and identifying where the art of finance has been applied.|$|R

While the access time of flash memory is highly predictable, deadline misses may occur if data objects in flash memory are not properly managed in real-time embedded databases. Buffer cache {{can be used}} to mitigate this problem. However, since the workload of a real-time database cannot be precisely predicted, it may not be feasible to provide enough buffer space to satisfy all timing constraints. Several deadline miss <b>ratio</b> <b>management</b> schemes have been proposed, but they do not consider I/O activities. In this paper, we present an I/O-aware deadline miss <b>ratio</b> <b>management</b> scheme in real-time embedded databases whose secondary storage is flash memory. We propose an adaptive I/O deadline assignment scheme, in which I/O deadlines are derived from up-to-date system status. We also present a deadline miss <b>ratio</b> <b>management</b> architecture where a control theory-based feedback control loop prevents resource overload both in I/O and CPU. A simulation study shows that our approach can effectively cope with both I/O and CPU overload to achieve the desired deadline miss ratio...|$|R
