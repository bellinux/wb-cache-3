The Frieden government continued {{the policy of the}} preceding government, putting more emphasis on reforms in education and culture. The law of 7 July 1958 introduced a new training regime for teachers. Their secondary studies would be complemented by two years at the [...] "Institut pédagogique". The law of 3 August 1958 created the [...] "Institut d'enseignement technique". The law of 5 December 1958 gave a legal status to the National Library and the State Archives. Other reforms, such as those of the state museums and professional education, could not be completed due to the premature death of the Prime Minister. The continual growth of the number of pupils required the construction of new school buildings. In 1958, construction was started for a new school campus on Boulevard Pierre Dupong, of which the first completed building was that of the new Athénée. The government also pursued the modernisation of the country's infrastructure. On 10 July 1958, it signed an agreement with the German Land Rhineland-Palatinate on the development of a pumping station on the Our, near Vianden. To achieve this, a private company with some investment by the Luxembourgish State had been created in 1951, the Société électrique de l’Our (SEO). The signing of the agreement allowed construction t start on the hydroelectric plant. The pumping station started working in 1963.|$|E

This contrasts with the ergonomic view of the activity, which recommends leaving operators leeway (<b>margins</b> <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre)</b> in performing their task, while safeguarding their health. Following a brief analysis of design practices in the car industry, we detail how the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) approach is implemented in this sector. We then suggest an adaptation that enables designers to consider real work situations. This new protocol, namely work situation FMEA, allows experience feedback to be used to defend the health standpoint during designer project reviews, which usually only address quality and performance issues. We subsequently illustrate the advantage of this approach using two examples of work situations at car parts manufacturers: the first from the literature and the second from an in-company industrial project we followed...|$|R

40|$|French local Public Transport Authorities {{consider}} urban {{public transport}} as a Public Service with four missions: accessibility to the city (low income households), reducing traffic congestion (urban economy), improving central area attractiveness (limiting urban sprawl), and limiting environmental damages. But the design of networks is often resulting from incremental changes, leading to a poor global performance. Trends show a risk of major crisis. Operating costs are increasing fast, as fare box revenue is lazing, leading to an increase of the operating deficit. Reducing CO 2 emissions implies to reconsider the design {{and the level of}} service to better attract car users. The performance of the service then is a key point to increase both patronage and revenue. Based on national data on Public Transport Networks (1995 - 2005), the paper presents financial simulation for different strategies and discusses how to stabilise public contribution. Two main paths emerge, but have to be applied together: improving the productivity through an in-depth study of operating conditions for each route, and redesigning the fare structure in a more personalised way to cope with the higher car drivers ’ willingness to pay. Conditions for such a large restructuration mean discussing contractual relations between Transport Authorities and operating companies (<b>margin</b> <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> to optimize performance) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{is a study}} about {{employment}} {{officers at}} the Swedish public employment service. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine how they understand and use their discretion in their daily work. We used a qualitative method and the data was gathered by semi-structured interviews with eight employment officers working at the same office in a small town in Sweden. Lipskys theory about street-level bureaucracy and Lazarus description of coping theory are applied to analyze the empirical data. The work for the Swedish employment officers have changed over the last years with an increasing focus on control and administration. The results from the study show that the employment officers considered that they have a freedom of action in their daily work about planning their meetings, but all of them thinks that the administration, and the fact that they have to handle too many unemployed means that they are lack of time, what leads to a negative impact on their discretion. All of the interviewed subjects indicated that the Swedish public employment service has a top-down organization. We found that the informants used a unified strategy to cope dilemmas by referring to the existing laws, both when they handled disgruntled unemployed and even as a way to cope their own liable situations. They could interpret the laws in different ways and they took help from the colleagues at the local office to decide how to interpret the laws. Even if dilemma was common in their work with the unemployed, they considered that their mission to control was mainly positive. The main reasons, to how the employment officers <b>margin</b> <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> are limited, appears to be the laws, the regulations and the available efforts for the unemployed...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} power {{refers to a}} certain {{capacity}} of particular States to impose their will on others and make them act in a certain way. In order to measure this influence and establish a hierarchy process, recourse {{has been made to}} various geographical, demographic,economic, military and political indicators. In the case of middle powers one ought also to add that the will of the State is of maximum importance in terms of how it acts as a middle power. From a list of 15 middle powers drawn up on criteria used in preceeding lists, the Spanish and Mexican cases are analyzed, (both of which are considered not incorrectly as middle powers for various reasons which share certain similarities); for their geostrategicsituation, for their level of economic development inferior to that of their neighbours, because they have served as models (economic development and democratic transition respectively) and also because both have offered themselves as “bridges”. Among the differences can be highlighted that which seperates those powers orientated towards the developed world and those which accept their belonging to the third world. At a moment in which States have multiplied themselves and in which the withdrawal of colonial powers has led to a certain withdrawal of those superpower pressures, the possibility that some middle powers can consolidate in some areas of influence is opened. The economic situation also plays a fundamental role and in this sense the crisis can be an important limitation. In any case the concept of middle power is indivisible from a specific international context and at present its main scope for action is the north-south confrontation with the economic factor at the forefront. Those compromises with which it has entered with certain organizations of economic integration can also reduce its <b>margin</b> <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre.</b> Finally, serious doubts are cast regarding the possibility of a concerted action by the middle powers in order to introduce qualitative improvements in international relations. It is, as with many others, a concept that needs to be reexamined and adapted to the newinternational context...|$|E
40|$|Access {{charges to}} the railway infrastructures, and in {{particular}} of the high speed lines, poses many theoretical and practical questions. Besides the need to decide whether {{it is better to}} apply a principle of marginal cost or a full cost approach, a difficulty arises with regard to the possibilities of competition between various operators. France is especially affected by this problem since access charges are particularly high {{while at the same time}} competition is non-existent. Is this absence of competition explained by the high level of access charges? After describing the principles which underlie the pricing scheme for high speed trains in France, this paper attempts to find out if these tolls constitute a barrier to entry. After building a model that summarizes the components of supply and demand on the Paris-Lyon journey, this paper shows that the considerations relating to demand (peak hour or off-peak hour) are more fundamental than access charges, which do not in themselves constitute a barrier to entry. Barriers exist, but they involve access charges in relation to the allocation of slots which would make it possible to guarantee certain profitability to a new entrant. Break-even points are proposed which show that SNCF's potential competitors have <b>margins</b> <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{large number}} of {{public-private}} partnerships (PPPs) have been awarded in the rail sector during recent decades. A review of rail PPPs over the last 30 years shows {{that some of them}} have failed, almost as though there was a curse on railway PPPs. Despite the evidence of risks associated with PPPs in the rail sector, the publicly owned French rail infrastructure manager (RFF) launched two major PPPs and a very large concession between 2010 and 2012. This decision was taken {{at the request of the}} government which made extending the network of High Speed Lines (HSLs) the cornerstone of its rail policy. After a description of the curse affecting some rail sector PPPs, the paper proposes a detailed presentation of the main on-going HSR projects in France. The aim of the paper is to explain how RFF and the French public authorities have tried to face the risks that affects rail sector PPPs. Why the government did recommend a concession for the biggest project and PPPs (in the strict sense of the term) for the other two? What are the main risks that remain for the public authorities when large projects face difficulties? The state is very often the lender of last resort but also the operator of last resort because it is usually highly unacceptable to simply close the service down. The paper also considers another major source of risk – the fact that public decision-makers behave like “risk lovers”. In this way they provide their private sector partners with <b>margins</b> <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> that encourage opportunistic behaviours.

40|$|Jury: Arthur Stockwin (Oxford University) Karoline Postel-Vinay (Institut d'études politiques de Paris) Dimitri Vanoverbeke (University of Leuven) Christian Galan (Université de Toulouse II) Éric Seizelet (Université de Paris VII) Summa cum laudeAt {{the end of}} the Second World War, Koreans {{constituted}} the main foreign community in Japan. Many of them were subjected to discrimination, and lived precariously or even in abject poverty. From {{the latter half of the}} 1950 s, when North Korean leaders were welcoming them and guaranteeing them decent living conditions, repatriation to North Korea represented hope for a better future for many of these Koreans. Between 1959 and 1984, more than 93, 000 people – of whom 2, 000 were Japanese women married to Koreans – arrived at the 38 th Parallel North. Nevertheless, the Japanese government, confronted by requests from the families of these Japanese women from 1974, tried to obtain information on their whereabouts, and asked for their return to Japan. The present work establishes a mapping of the actors implicated in the decision-Making process concerning repatriation operations to North Korea, but also in the negotiations retated to the Japanese women. More specifically, this study highlights the role of the “subsidiary actors” – of which the Japanese Red Cross and national parliamentarians are the most prominent – those that intervened where the government’s <b>margins</b> <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvring</b> were narrow in the absence of official diplomatic relations between Japan and North Korea. This institutional constraint led to an investment in fields of action that had traditionally been relegated to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (negotiation, protection of nationals abroad, intelligence, etc.) by these “subsidiary actors”, and a subsequent analysis of these actors provided both a more complete and less state-Centred image of Japan’s foreign policy. status: publishe...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse work flexibility of organic suckler sheep farms using the criterion 'room <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> in time'. A survey about work organisation was conducted on 14 organic sheep farms in the central region of France to quantify work durations and tasks carried out by different categories of workers in order to calculate the room <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> in time. Statistical analysis was performed to analyse variability in room <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre.</b> A cluster analysis conducted on four variables describing room <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> in time over the year classified the farms into three groups. The results show that the room <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> in time per person displayed a broad variability according to the farms (396 to 1, 199 h per year). The amount of routine work per person of the basic group was one factor explaining the differences. Results show different ways to obtain room <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> in time and its temporal distribution over the year, among organic suckler sheep farms. Three repartitions were identified. Group 1 was characterised by a low room <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> in winter, corresponding to the period of lambing in the sheep barn. The high routine workload was carried out self-sufficiently by the basic group. Group 2 had a high room <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> over the year. The farmers delegated a part of the routine work during holidays. Group 3 had a low room <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> over the year. These farms had lambings throughout the year due to several different lambing periods.

The negotiated {{wages in}} these firm-level agreements cannot be below the sectoral agreements. 5 Also firm-level agreements {{are more common}} in large firms with stronger union representation than in smaller firms.

This provides them with a wage cushion above the sector minima, creating some <b>margin</b> of <b>manoeuvre</b> <b>for</b> wage adjustments. Individual data from the Belgian Structure of Earnings Survey (SES) show that companies with firm-level agreements for blue-collar and white-collar workers pay on average 12 % higher earnings and bonuses are 53 % higher.
