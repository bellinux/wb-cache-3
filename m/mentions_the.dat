30|$|Although several {{students}} <b>mentioned</b> <b>the</b> {{positive impact on}} SE from other group members, one student directly <b>mentioned</b> <b>the</b> impact that the teacher had on his own SE.|$|R
50|$|It is {{frequently}} mistakenly repeated that Ramsey <b>mentioned</b> <b>the</b> Knights Templar in his Discourse, {{when in fact}} he did not <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> Order at all - he <b>mentioned</b> <b>the</b> Knights Hospitaller. But perceptive listeners would have understood his <b>mention</b> of <b>the</b> Crusader knights to be an indirect reference to the Knights Templar, the memory of whom was still controversial in France and {{may have led to}} the Pope's indictment of the organization a year later.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> bland {{mistress}} <b>mentioned</b> <b>the</b> hour. The rude governess {{left the}} room.|$|R
5|$|In {{his novel}} Ulysses, James Joyce <b>mentions</b> <b>the</b> bird while the novel's main {{character}} is drifting into sleep. He associates the great auk with the mythical roc {{as a method}} of formally returning the main character to a sleepy land of fantasy and memory.|$|E
5|$|In their {{histories}} of Somerset County Cricket Club, Peter Roebuck and David Foot mostly gloss over the season; Roebuck includes a scorecard, but provides only two paragraphs of prose, while Foot only <b>mentions</b> <b>the</b> loss of first-class cricket.|$|E
5|$|S.35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 <b>mentions</b> <b>the</b> Métis {{yet there}} {{has long been}} debate over legally {{defining}} the term Métis, but on September 23, 2003, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Métis are a distinct people with significant rights (Powley ruling).|$|E
60|$|In {{the course}} of the same day, he <b>mentioned</b> <b>the</b> Bridgenorth to his mother, as if in a casual manner. But the Lady Peveril {{instantly}} conjured him never to <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> name, especially in his father's presence.|$|R
50|$|Although Sambandar {{prominently}} {{features in}} the various versions of the legend, his writings do not <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> story. Other contemporary writings in Tamil or other languages do not <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> legend either. A number of 9th and 10th century Pandyan inscriptions <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> important events from the reigns of the preceding Pandyan kings since the 7th century. However, the alleged massacre of the Jains is not mentioned {{in any of these}} inscriptions.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> Jatakas also <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> {{existence}} of loan deeds. These were called rnapatra or rnapanna. The Dharmashastras also supported {{the use of}} loan deeds. Kautilya has also <b>mentioned</b> <b>the</b> usage of loan deeds. Loans deeds were also called rnalekhaya.|$|R
5|$|The Devi Bhagavata Purana also <b>mentions</b> <b>the</b> Mahavidyas as war-companions {{and forms}} of the goddess Shakambhari. An oral {{tradition}} similarly replaces Shakambhari with the goddess Durga.|$|E
5|$|The French {{entomologist}} Jean-Henri Fabre's popular Souvenirs Entomoloqiques devotes a whole {{chapter to}} the cricket, discussing its {{construction of a}} burrow and its song-making. The account is mainly of the field cricket, but also <b>mentions</b> <b>the</b> Italian cricket.|$|E
5|$|The {{book has}} 14 {{monochrome}} photographs taken mainly by Newby, and two hand-drawn maps. The novelist Evelyn Waugh wrote a preface that <b>mentions</b> <b>the</b> book's whimsy and its Englishness.|$|E

5000|$|Two mawlids, {{celebrating the}} life of Muhammad: <b>The</b> Shimmering Light <b>Mentioning</b> <b>the</b> Birth of the Interceding Prophet (al-Diya al-Lami’ fi Dhikr Mawlid al-Nabi al-Shafi’) and <b>The</b> Pure Drink <b>Mentioning</b> <b>the</b> Life of the Fullest of Moons (al-Sharab al-Tuhur fi Dhikri Sirati Badri al-Budur) ...|$|R
5|$|With {{the arrival}} of the year 2012, Nostradamus's prophecies started to be co-opted (especially by the History Channel) as {{evidence}} suggesting {{that the end of the}} world was imminent, notwithstanding the fact that his book never <b>mentions</b> <b>the</b> end of the world, let alone the year 2012.|$|E
5|$|Among {{many other}} things, he gave {{accurate}} {{descriptions of the}} four-chambered stomachs of ruminants, and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the dogfish. His accounts of about 35 animals are sufficiently detailed to convince biologists that he dissected those species, indeed vivisecting some; he <b>mentions</b> <b>the</b> internal anatomy of roughly 110 animals in total.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, {{there are}} no records of a {{large-scale}} Greek slave revolt {{comparable to that of}} Spartacus in Rome. It can probably be explained by the relative dispersion of Greek slaves, which would have prevented any large-scale planning. Slave revolts were rare, even in Rome. Individual acts of rebellion of slaves against their master, though scarce, are not unheard of; a judicial speech <b>mentions</b> <b>the</b> attempted murder of his master by a boy slave, not 12 years old.|$|E
5000|$|Pediatrician Philip LaRussa {{wrote that}} [...] "Wakefield’s film acts {{as if his}} {{research}} had not been revealed as fraudulent": Wakefield didn’t <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> fact that he lost his license in Great Britain, he didn’t <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> fact that 11 of his co-authors withdrew their names from his paper. He didn’t <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that there was}} a series of investigative articles by journalist Brian Deer. None of that existed in this film. Vaxxed: an expert view on controversial film about vaccines and autism.|$|R
50|$|Gildas {{does not}} <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> battle.|$|R
5000|$|As Talmudic sources never <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> Essenes but do <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> Boethusians, while Greek sources (including Josephus) never <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> Boethusians as such but <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> Essenes as a {{prominent}} group, {{and as the}} Essenes are often identified with the sect that produced the Dead Sea Scrolls, which do indeed bear some similarity to views attributed to the Boethusians by the Talmud, the suggestion has been made that {{the two groups were}} more or less identical, the word [...] "Boethusian" [...] being a corruption of [...] "Beit Essaya," [...] or [...] "House of Essenes." [...] This is admittedly a highly speculative position with little actual evidence to back it up, but is sometimes seen as the most likely explanation at the very least.|$|R
5|$|Dioscorides then {{describes}} {{how to tell}} a good from a counterfeit preparation. He <b>mentions</b> <b>the</b> recommendations of other physicians, Diagoras (according to Eristratus), Andreas, and Mnesidemus, only to dismiss them as false and not borne out by experience. He ends {{with a description of}} how the liquid is gathered from poppy plants, and lists names used for it: chamaesyce, mecon rhoeas, oxytonon; papaver to the Romans, and wanti to the Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|During his consulship he {{advocated}} for the accused in court, {{which was a}} popular move, reminiscent of when he formerly used to plea for his defendants directly to Augustus. He also appealed to the people by ministering the Ludi Martiales (games of Mars), where he let loose two hundred lions in the Circus Maximus. Pliny the Elder <b>mentions</b> <b>the</b> games in his Historia Naturalis.|$|E
5|$|In 1887 {{the town}} was {{described}} as having an antique appearance, with its principal trade being salt, along with fruit and vegetables, and small silk and heavy cotton works. The town had one bank and one newspaper. By 1911 the Encyclopædia Britannica <b>mentions</b> <b>the</b> existence of chemical works and the manufacture of condensed milk.|$|E

5|$|In 597 {{the mission}} landed in Kent, and it quickly {{achieved}} some initial success: Æthelberht permitted the missionaries to settle and preach in his capital of Canterbury, where {{they used the}} church of St. Martin's for services, and this church became {{the seat of the}} bishopric. Neither Bede nor Gregory <b>mentions</b> <b>the</b> date of Æthelberht's conversion, but it probably took place in 597.|$|E
5|$|In a {{manuscript}} {{he wrote in}} 1704 (never intended to be published) he <b>mentions</b> <b>the</b> date of 2060, {{but it is not}} given as a date for the end of days. It has been falsely reported as a prediction. The passage is clear, when you read the date in context. He was against date setting for the end of days, concerned that this would put Christianity into disrepute.|$|E
5|$|In a post-credits scene {{after the}} main game's ending, Zobek is seen alive during modern times, and has {{uncovered}} Gabriel {{living as a}} vampire called Dracula. Zobek <b>mentions</b> <b>the</b> acolytes of Satan are preparing for his return and that they must stop him before he takes revenge on both of them. Before Gabriel disappears, Zobek tells him he will free him of his immortality if he helps him.|$|E
2500|$|The Hathigumpha {{inscription}} describes Kharavela as {{a descendant}} of Mahameghavahana. It does not directly <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> relationship between Mahameghavahana and Kharavela, nor does it <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> number of kings intervening between them.
