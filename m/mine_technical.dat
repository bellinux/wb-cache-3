50|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{improving}} labor safety and labor conditions for the miners, the company “Saknakhshiri” has purchased new equipment of $3.5 million. New wagons, bulldozers, locomotives - {{part of the new}} equipment is already located in the company yard… Schedule allocated for the <b>mine</b> <b>technical</b> re-equipment has shifted to the final stage. Tkibuli is expecting to receive {{the second part of the}} equipment from China and Ukraine by the end of the year, after what there will begin dismantling works of old equipment and placement of new. This will virtually rebound the risk for miners, when conducting drilling and blasting works in mines, the mines will be mechanized, which is a step of utmost importance for improving labor safety and labor conditions.Mine monitoring, the company completed re-equipment descriptive works last year. According to the schedule, renewing and rehabilitation works will commence by the end of the year. The equipment purchased and imported for the current period of time exceeds the investment of $3 million. This is a major priority for the company and they believe this is a permanent process. Seven units of local airing coolers are already on place, also four units of set of point switch locomotive adapters, three sets of locomotives. They were also renewed last year. Six sets of locomotive batteries.In a series of accidents in 2010 and 2011, several workers were killed and injured in the Tkibuli coal mine, operated by the GIG subsidiary Saqnakhshiri. In January 2011, the President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili accused the coal mine owners of neglecting safety norms and of covering up real reasons behind the incidents. The same month two of the company's employees responsible for safety issues were arrested, while the miners responded to the incidents with a strike.|$|E
40|$|Patents {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} innovative resources. It is a challenge and useful to discover technical topics and their relations from patents. A process framework is proposed to <b>mine</b> <b>technical</b> topics and construct their relation network from Chinese patents. The process consists of four stages. First, technical terms are extracted from patent texts and the equivalence index is selected to measure the link strength between them. Then, a clustering algorithm is used to group terms into topic clusters, in which terms are connected by internal links, and topic clusters are connected by external links. Afterwards, all topics are classified into three categories: isolated, principal and secondary. Finally, a technical topic network is created by using topic clusters as nodes, external links as edges and the number of external links as weights. Experimental results on Chinese fuel cell patents show the method is effective in mining technical topics and mapping their relations, and the constructed network is helpful for technology innovation...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2014. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: A sound {{strategic}} {{approach to the}} management of the <b>Mine</b> <b>Technical</b> Services (MTS) department at Styldrift is critical. There are numerous areas of influence that {{play a role in the}} success or failure of the department. All these influences have an impact on each other and these influences need to be carefully understood. Within the MTS department there are also several subdepartments that have to be staffed, equipped and managed very well in order to get the best interdependent relationship between departments as possible. It is only through this interdependent relationship that the department can function complementarily and excel in achieving its strategic goals. Mineral resources at a mine are managed through the services from the <b>mine</b> <b>technical</b> team. There are few strategic documents in the mineral resource management (MRM) field that provide a guideline to set up a department successfully. Departments throughout the country operate on different levels with different standards without the knowledge shared from the one section to the next. For the purpose of this assignment, some of the ground principles were investigated and documented to create a link between departments, mines and companies to enable the move towards operational excellence within the MTS. Through the application of relevant literature, research was conducted on the industry to determine best practices. The industry best practices are discussed and referenced to Styldrift Specific. The strategy and management philosophy were evaluated and are highlighted in this assignment. With the literature firmly understood and the required direction from the company placed in perspective, the strategy for the MTS department could be crafted to an extent that it can be executed. Each department was broken down to manageable elements to understand the functioning of the department. The fundamental OR requirements were evaluated and are stipulated in this paper. The MTS department was then dissected through the available theory to guide the process of crafting and executing the departmental strategy. The journey through to operational excellence and the fundamental guideline of crafting and executing a strategic plan for an MTS department to manage mineral resources become clearer as the chapters of the assignment are completed. The end goal of the project was to have a document that can guide staffing, equipping and management of the MTS department at Styldrift in order to ensure success for the project, mine and surrounding communities...|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} a {{pressure}} quantity survey is usually brought about {{by a lack of}} knowledge of the actual value of various roadway, branch and infrastructure resistances around the mine. If resistances are not known or are suspected to be erroneous then it is difficult or impossible to accurately replicate the circuit performance, on a ventilation modelling software program. The challenge for mine operators is to carefully decide what level of survey detail is required so that the appropriate adjustments can be made to an existing model or the appropriate data collected so a model can be built in the first instance. The level of survey detail required is totally dependent on the end use of the data and the criticality of the accuracy of the dataset, to the safety and viability of the business. <b>Mine</b> <b>technical</b> personnel should think clearly about the report outputs required that will help them better understand their mines and better prepare them to manage their own ventilation circuits, on an ongoing basis. Some methods of data collection and circuit analysis required for surveys up to a high order of accuracy are detailed. Some of the issues which are important when formulating a strategy to carry out the appropriate ventilation survey for the required purpose are summarised. Some details that should be furnished within any survey and some survey/report outputs and/or omissions, which are clearly not acceptable, are highlighted...|$|E
