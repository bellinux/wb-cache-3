2500|$|Bronstein faced Furman in the 1948 Soviet Championship, won the game, but was {{impressed}} with Furman's skill. Bronstein wrote, in his acclaimed book The Sorcerer's Apprentice (page 102): [...] "Later, when I recognised the logical play of Furman, I invited him to be <b>my</b> <b>assistant</b> during preparation for the match [...] in 1951. Also, I took him abroad as my second to the Interzonal Tournament in Gothenburg in 1955 and the Candidates' Tournament in Amsterdam 1956." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{the ship}} sank, I {{was stuck in}} a whirlpool, {{wrenched}} and whirled till I thought my legs would be pulled off. [...] I saw a body alongside me. [...] It was Will Thomas, <b>my</b> <b>assistant.</b> [...] I tried to revive him when a broken hatch cover came up and struck the lad on the head, crushing it. [...] My life preserver came off and while I was floundering in the water, another hatch cover came up. [...] I grabbed the ring and pulled myself up on it. [...] I saw a foot sticking up from beneath it, and pulling it, {{found it to be}} Thomas McKernan, the son of the chief engineer. [...] I pulled him up and he revived after a while. [...] The lake was covered with wreckage and all around in the fog could be heard cries of [...] "Help" [...] but it was three quarters of an hour before the yawls of the Scott had been loosened and put in the water.|$|E

25|$|To this day, {{the bathtub}} is where I get {{many of my}} best ideas. <b>My</b> <b>assistants</b> have gotten used to typing from drafts scrawled on damp yellow pads—a chore that got much easier once we found a kind of pen whose ink doesn't run. Immersed in my bath, I'm as happy as Archimedes as I {{contemplate}} the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "We shall start Monday morning," [...] was the answer. [...] "To-morrow we {{will get}} out our tents and camping outfits and see that all are in {{first-class}} order. It is perhaps needless to add that during this encampment the officers will be in authority during all but off hours, when myself and <b>my</b> <b>assistants</b> will take charge." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor {{the less}} of <b>my</b> <b>assistant</b> either," [...] said the Baronet; [...] "my doors and table shall be equally open {{to him as}} if he had descended of the most {{unblemished}} lineage." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm afraid these beasts don't {{understand}} regulations, and I had {{to bring}} them as best I could," [...] I answered; and <b>my</b> <b>assistant</b> shouted, [...] "Get out of the daylight, sergeant, dear, while your shoes are good." ...|$|E
50|$|His {{signature}} red soles {{were first}} created in 1993. “My sketches were not reproduced exactly as I had designed them and I couldn’t figure out why. The two dimensional sketch {{was so powerful}} on paper, but when turned into a three-dimensional object, it was somehow lacking energy. Frustrated after having tried different things to liven up the design, I spontaneously grabbed <b>my</b> <b>assistant’s</b> red nail polish and painted the sole. I instantly knew {{that this would be}} a success!”.|$|R
6000|$|... "About a {{fortnight}} since, I was sent for, just as I had finished my lecture to the students, {{to see one}} of my servants. He had been suffering from illness for one or two days. I had of course offered him my medical services. He refused, however, to trouble me; sending word that he only wanted rest. Fortunately one of <b>my</b> <b>assistants</b> happened to see him, and at once felt the necessity of calling in my help.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, I am, sir,' {{replied the}} worthy pedagogue; 'Mr Wackford Squeers is my name, and I'm {{very far from}} being ashamed of it. These are some of my boys, sir; that's one of <b>my</b> <b>assistants,</b> sir--Mr Nickleby, a gentleman's son, and a good scholar, mathematical, classical, and commercial. We don't do things by halves at our shop. All manner of {{learning}} my boys take down, sir; the expense is never thought of; and they get paternal treatment and washing in.' ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{confessed that}} he had been too busy with other matters to give the Aiken {{accusation}} much thought. [...] "However, I sent an armful of books out to <b>my</b> <b>assistant</b> attorney." [...] He waved his hand toward Victor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Always glad {{to meet an}} {{interesting}} Britisher," [...] {{the man of the}} pen answered with cheerfulness. [...] "Come in peace, and we'll regale you on our special cigars; otherwise, <b>my</b> <b>assistant</b> will stand by with the politicians' club." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And," [...] {{continued}} Lucien, [...] "he has permitted me {{to select}} situations for you. I have arranged that you, father, shall be <b>my</b> <b>assistant</b> in the secretary's office, and that you, Mariano, shall be shopman to Bacri the Jew." ...|$|E

5000|$|Tsujii {{said in a}} 2011 interview, [...] "I learn {{pieces by}} listening, but it doesn't mean I'm copying CDs or another person's interpretation. I ask <b>my</b> <b>assistants</b> to make a special {{cassette}} tape for me. They split the piece into small sections, such as several bars, and record it (one hand at a time). I call these tapes 'music sheets for ears.' It takes me {{a few days to}} complete a short piece, but it takes one month to complete a big sonata or concerto." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jerry Romans once trained from Barn 4 at Churchill Downs, {{which is}} now one of two barns used by his son. Romans said, [...] "We have a great team from top to bottom. We have hotwalkers that have been with us for over 10 years. <b>My</b> <b>assistants</b> have been {{together}} since we were 19 and 20 working for my father. And Tammy is a huge part of the stable. She breezes all the horses, and there is nobody that gives a better line on a horse than she does." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} I will ask him twice," [...] said my father, sternly, [...] "to be my friend, <b>my</b> <b>assistant,</b> and my confidant?--to be a partner of my cares and of my fortune?--Owen, I {{thought you had}} known me better." ...|$|E
60|$|Having {{been very}} much overwrought in the {{hospitals}} that day, I flung myself on my bed and fell into a sound sleep, having previously cautioned <b>my</b> <b>assistant,</b> who occupied a couch opposite mine, not to disturb me except {{in a case of}} necessity.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, I {{worked in}} shirt-sleeves {{all the time}} that was going on. I pulled down the old rafters, fixed the new ones, put on the battens, slated the roof, all with my own hands, Worm being <b>my</b> <b>assistant.</b> We worked like slaves, didn't we, Worm?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, t'en, we wilt all pe off for t'e {{place in}} t'e morning. <b>My</b> new <b>assistant</b> is near, {{and it is}} high time Frank and I hat gone into t'e woots ag'in." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the press}} release for This Is a Work of Fiction at Schroeder Romero, Powhida wrote, [...] "I can't keep sitting around my studio getting drunk and yelling at <b>my</b> <b>assistants</b> forever." [...] He arrived at the opening for that {{exhibition}} with a black eye and a cut. After viewing a set of Powhida's drawings about a night of hard drinking and bar fights, art critic James Kalm, taking the drawings at face value, offered the artist some personal advice on sobriety. Other accounts have described a more socially-responsible artist {{who works as a}} teacher at a public high-school in Brooklyn.|$|R

6000|$|... "There is no use repudiating {{anything}} that bears our stamp," [...] said Geoffrey, disregarding the lawyer's frown, and looking steadily into the bewildered face of Thomas Savine. [...] "I work out all such calculations {{and make the}} sketches myself. <b>My</b> <b>assistant</b> sometimes checks them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "D'you {{suppose that}} after forty years' {{practice}} I care a twopenny damn whether people prefer <b>my</b> <b>assistant</b> to me? No, my friend. There's no sentiment between my patients and me. I don't expect gratitude from them, I {{expect them to}} pay my fees. Well, what d'you say to it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Talk not of mines,” {{interrupted}} the Judge: “there {{is a sacred}} duty to be performed, and that without delay, I must devote this day to writing; and thou must be <b>my</b> <b>assistant,</b> Richard; it will not do to employ Oliver {{in a matter of}} such secrecy and interest,” ...|$|E
40|$|For much of {{the past}} 15 years, <b>my</b> <b>assistants</b> and I have been reading minutes and papers in the National Archives, the Board of Governors, and the New York Federal Reserve Bank.

Volume 1 covers the 1913 – 1951 period and has been in print several years (Meltzer 2003). Volume 2, published in February, is in two parts: part one (Meltzer 2010 a) covers the 1951 – 69 period, and part two (Meltzer 2010 b) chronicles the 1970 – 86 period. In this article, I discuss some principal findings from volume 2. The starting point is the 1951 Accord with the Treasury that permitted the long-term interest rate to rise above 2. 5 percent.

5000|$|... "My sculptures depend {{a lot on}} {{the spaces}} where they are shown because they often are {{anchored}} into the wall but chance is definitely more of a factor in the final product than is any predetermined design. I just let the structures evolve by repeating the same action again and again. The process has a slightly neurotic element in that it involves adding little behavior habits. As silly as it sounds, I often feel as if <b>my</b> <b>assistants</b> and I are beavers building a dam. The shapes are less about form than they are about the activity involved in amassing and assembling the forms." ...|$|R
