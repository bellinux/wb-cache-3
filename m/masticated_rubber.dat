50|$|By 1830 it {{was obvious}} to {{everyone}} concerned that Hancock's leather solution, prepared with his <b>masticated</b> <b>rubber,</b> was better than Macintosh's. The two inventors merged their companies and began more fully co-operating, constructing, for example, an automatic spreading machine to replace the paint brushes previously used by Macintosh.|$|E
40|$|International audienceMastication {{of natural}} rubber (NR) is {{undertaken}} as a preliminary step towards {{the preparation of}} NR-based vulcanizates, a process during which the elastomer is broken down to a homogeneous matrix of lower viscosity. Several tests and indicators are in use for characterizing the behavior of elastomers but these have mostly been adopted for the nonmasticated product. This study uses coefficients generated from modeled Mooney relaxation data, as indicators of elasticity, to {{examine the effect of}} high-temperature mastication on the processability of the <b>masticated</b> <b>rubber.</b> Some derived coefficients such as the terminal relaxation time (s) from Maxwell's triexponential model, the elastic component (a) from Wu-Abbott model [Y ¼ 1 þ a* ln(t) bt/(c þ t) ], and the constant (b) from the Power law model (Y ¼ at b), adequately characterized the effect of mastication on NR. Although the NR grades studied were quite different with respect to their initial molar mass distributions, they followed a similar response to the mechanical models before and after mastication, indicating therefore that mastication decomposes to a similar extent, the various components (long isoprene chains, densely crosslinked solvent-insoluble gel, etc.) that account for the viscoelastic behavior of the raw elastomer...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} studying the relationship between rubber mixing processes and curing characteristics of natural rubber. The curing characteristic analysis was carried out through a natural rubber formula having been masticated and mixed, followed by curing. As many as four mastication methods were finely applied; each respected four sequences of rubber mixing process. In the first method, rubber was masticated for 5 minutes and then rubber chemicals and carbon black N 330 were simultaneously added. In the second and the third methods, rubber was masticated for 1 minute and then carbon blacks and rubber chemicals were also simultaneously added but using different type of fillers. In the fourth method, rubber was masticated for 3 minutes and then rubber chemicals and carbon black were subsequently added. The additions of rubber chemicals and carbon blacks to the <b>masticated</b> <b>rubber</b> were distinguished by the sequence and time allocated for each mixing process. The carbon blacks were added in two stages by which 10 phr was added first and the remaining 40 phr was added later along with oil. In another method, ratios of the carbon blacks addition (as done {{in the first and}} the second stages) were 20 : 30, 30 : 20, and 40 : 10. The examination results showed that rubber mixing process gave an impact on the changes of curing characteristics. They were much affected by the method of carbon black addition. The mixing temperature also had an effect on both curing time and curing rate in which the higher the mixing temperature, the lower the curing time and curing rate. Vulcanizationtemperature also affected the curing time and curing rate in which the higher the vulcanization temperature, the lower the curing time and the higher the curing rate. Lastly, particle size of carbon black also gave an impact on the curing time and curing rate in which the smaller the particle size, the lower the curing time and the higher the curing rate...|$|E

30|$|For the gum vulcanizates, the {{vulcanizing}} ingredients (5 phr ZnO, 2 phr stearic acid, 0.5 phr sulfur, and accelerators) {{are incorporated}} in the <b>masticated</b> natural <b>rubber</b> (NR) (RMA- 1 X) on a laboratory-mixing mill and the mixing is done up to 15  min. The total concentration of accelerator(s) is kept at 9 -mmol phr (per 100  g of rubber).|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Carboxy Terminated Liquid Natural Rubber (CTNR) was {{prepared}} by photochemical reaction using maleic anhydride and <b>masticated</b> natural <b>rubber</b> (NR). The use of CTNR as an adhesive in bonding rubber to rubber and rubber to metal was studied. The peel strengths and lap shear {{strengths of the}} adherends which were bonded using CTNR were determined. The effect of using a tri isocyanate with CTNR in rubber to metal bonding was also studied. It is found that CTNR can effectively be used in bonding rubber to rubber and rubber to mild steel...|$|R
40|$|Applicability of Thermal field flow {{fractionation}} (ThFFF) {{was investigated}} {{for the analysis}} of <b>masticated</b> nat-ural <b>rubber</b> (NR) adhesives produced by a hot melt mastication process. An optimum ThFFF condition for NR analysis was found by using tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a solvent/carrier and a field-programming. Low flowrate (0. 3 mL/min) was used to avoid stopping the flow for the sample relaxation. Measured molecular weight dis-tribution was used to monitor degradation of rubber during the mastication process. Rubber samples collected at three different stages of the mastication process and were analyzed by ThFFF. It was found that in an anaer-obic process rubber degradation occurs at the resin-mixing (compounding) zone {{as well as in the}} initial break-down zone, while in an aerobic process most of degradation occurs at the initial breakdown zone. It was also found that E-beam radiation on NR causes a slight increase in the NR molecular weight due to the formation of a branched structure...|$|R
