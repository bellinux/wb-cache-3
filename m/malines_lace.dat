6000|$|... "Yes," [...] says she, [...] "I solemnly vow, own, and confess, that I {{want a good}} husband. Where's {{the harm}} of one? My face is my fortune. Who'll come?--buy, buy, buy! I cannot toil, neither can I spin, but I can play twenty-three games on the cards. I can dance the last dance, I can hunt the stag, and I think I could shoot flying. I can talk as wicked as any woman of my years, and know enough stories to amuse a sulky husband {{for at least one}} {{thousand}} and one nights. I have a pretty taste for dress, diamonds, gambling, and old China. I love sugar-plums, <b>Malines</b> <b>lace</b> (that you brought me, cousin, is very pretty), the opera, and everything that is useless and costly. I have got a monkey and a little black boy--Pompey, sir, go and give a dish of chocolate to Colonel Graveairs,--and a parrot and a spaniel, and I must have a husband. Cupid, you hear?" ...|$|E
60|$|A {{few days}} after the famous presentation, another great and {{exceeding}} honour was vouchsafed to the virtuous Becky. Lady Steyne's carriage drove up to Mr. Rawdon Crawley's door, and the footman, instead of driving down the front of the house, as by his tremendous knocking he appeared to be inclined to do, relented and only delivered in a couple of cards, on which were engraven the names of the Marchioness of Steyne and the Countess of Gaunt. If these bits of pasteboard had been beautiful pictures, or had had a hundred yards of <b>Malines</b> <b>lace</b> rolled round them, worth twice the number of guineas, Becky could not have regarded them with more pleasure. You may be sure they occupied a conspicuous place in the china bowl on the drawing-room table, where Becky kept the cards of her visitors. Lord! lord! how poor Mrs. Washington White's card and Lady Crackenbury's card--which our little friend had been glad enough to get a few months back, and of which the silly little creature was rather proud once--Lord! lord! I say, how soon at the appearance of these grand court cards, did those poor little neglected deuces sink {{down to the bottom of}} the pack. Steyne! Bareacres, Johnes of Helvellyn! and Caerylon of Camelot! we may be sure that Becky and Briggs looked out those august names in the Peerage, and followed the noble races up through all the ramifications of the family tree.|$|E
