5|$|<b>Methylcyclopentadienyl</b> <b>manganese</b> <b>tricarbonyl</b> (MMT) is a {{gasoline}} additive used to replace lead compounds for unleaded gasolines {{to improve the}} octane rating of low octane petroleum distillates. It reduces engine knock agent through {{the action of the}} carbonyl groups. Fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides, which damage exhaust valves. The need for lead or manganese additives is merely historic because the modern reformation processes create fuels with increased octane ratings. Such fuels, directly or in mixture with non-reformed distillates, are universal in developed countries (0EU, Japan, etc.). In the USA, the imperative to provide the lowest price per volume on motor fuels and the lowest taxation rate, combined with lax legislation of fuel content before the year 2000, encouraged refineries to use MMT. Compared to 1953, levels of manganese in air have dropped. Many racing competitions specifically ban manganese compounds in racing fuel for carts and minibikes. MMT contains 24.4–25.2% manganese. Elevated atmospheric manganese concentrations are strongly correlated with automobile traffic density.|$|E

40|$|Two new {{techniques}} {{for the study}} of biological molecules using vibrational spectroscopy have been investigated, and are presented in this thesis in two parts.

The synthesis of new organometallic labels for use in LPIRIA has been undertaken and is described in detail. A competitive non-agglutination LPIRIA for BSA using anti-BSA covalently bound to carboxylate-modified latex (CML) particles has been developed. Protein-A, a universal antibody binder, covalently bound onto CML, is used in the development of a competitive non-agglutination LPIRIA for nortriptyline and for the titration of anti-theophylline by theophylline.

Canada, especially following the replacement of tetraethylplumbane in gasoline by <b>methylcyclopentadienyl</b> <b>manganese).</b> Treatment of polluted waters by manganese is therefore essential prior to their release, which is within {{the purpose of the present}} study. Commercial activated carbon (AC) was used for treating synthetic aqueous solution containing different concentrations of Mn. Adsorption kinetics was studied under agitation at different temperatures between 295 and 318 K. Results show that there are two areas where adsorption occurs according to a first-class model. In the first one, rate constant is k 1 = 0. 001610 min- 1, meanwhile in the second, it is k 2 = 0. 000488 min- 1. Equilibrium is reached in 7 hours. The obtained adsorption isotherm is a V type and follows Freundlich model for low concentrations and Langmuir model for high concentrations. The isotherm part described by Freundlich model lessens with the rise of temperature, increasing adsorption maximum capacity from 3. 49 mg Mn/g AC (at 295 K) to 4. 78 mg Mn/g AC (at 318 K). Adsorption is endothermic. Standard enthalpy (14. 4869 kJ•mol- 1) and standard entropy (36. 25 J•mol- 1 •K- 1) have been calculated.

Recently, we reported on the identification of a novel CPP, sC 18, which is derived from the C-terminus of the 18 kDa cationic antimicrobial protein. Furthermore, we demonstrated successful application of sC 18 for the delivery of functionalized cyclopentadienyl <b>manganese</b> <b>tricarbonyl</b> (cymantrene) complexes to tumor cell lines, inducing high cellular toxicity.

Therefore, we designed a branched dimeric variant of sC 18, (sC 18) _ 2, which was shown to have a dramatically improved capacity to internalize into various cell lines, even primary cells, using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Cell viability assays indicated increased cytotoxicity of the dimer presumably caused by membrane leakage; however, this effect turned out to be dependent on the specific cell type. Finally, we could show that conjugation of a functionalized cymantrene with (sC 18) _ 2 leads to significant reduction of its IC_ 50 value in tumor cells compared to the respective sC 18 conjugate, proving that dimerization is a useful method to increase the drug-delivery potential of a cell-penetrating peptide...|$|R
40|$|This review {{attempts}} {{to provide an}} overview of the interconnected industrial changes associated with compliance with the exhaust emission standards of the Clean Air Act of 1970. To understand the complex nature of air pollution problems, Federal legislation, and compliance with this legislation requires an understanding of automotive technology, petroleum refining, atmospheric chemistry and physics, economics, and public health. The endeavors of all of these different areas impinge {{to a greater or lesser}} extent on the final response to the Clean Air Act which is designed to safeguard public health. This overview begins by examining gasoline refinery practice and gasoline composition. Included in this discussion are average values for trace contaminants in gasoline, and an explanation of the function of the many gasoline additives. Next, exhaust emissions are characterized, average values of exhaust components given, and a summary of important atmospheric air pollution reactions presented. Emission control devices and sulfate emissions from these devices are described.

40|$|Electrical doping {{of organic}} {{semiconductors}} with molecular oxidants (p-type) or reductants (n-type) can greatly improve charge injection and conductivity in devices. Simple one electron reductants that {{are capable of}} reducing most electron-transport materials will inevitably also be sensitive to reaction with oxygen. Coupling electron transfer step with bond breaking/ making processes in principle can address this problem. The rhodocene dimer and related ruthenium and iridium dimeric sandwich compounds have been discussed as example of such n-dopants, reducing a variety of organic semiconductors to the corresponding radical anions, while forming monomeric cations. This class of n-dopants can be used in both vapor- and solution-processed devices, and the dopant monomer cations are large and, therefore, fairly stable with respect to diffusion. This thesis focused on increasing the utility of these and related electrical dopants. In order to reduce various electron-transport materials with lower electron affinities, which are frequently used in OLEDs, strategies and limitations to develop stronger n-dopants is discussed. Controlling the kinetics of the dopant / semiconductor reactions to allow film processing in ambient conditions, with activation of the dopants being carried out thermally or photochemically in subsequent steps is presented. An approach to covalently tether monomeric cations with themselves, surfaces or electron-transport materials is described. Electrochemical studies that further our understanding of dopant kinetics and thermodynamics is described.

An electron diffraction investigation of ferrocene confirmed the proposed sandwich structure. The following distances for a model with D 5 d symmetry were derived by the correlation method: Fe-C, 2. 064 A; C-C, 1. 440 A. Both models in which the rings were allowed to rotate with a small potential barrier and models in which the inter-ring C [...] . C distances were assigned a moderately large vibrational temperature factor constant, with no rotation, were found to be consistent with the visual data.

40|$|In this paper, {{the growth}} of GaN:Mn thin films by plasma-assisted metalorganic {{chemical}} vapor deposition (PAMOCVD) method is reported. The method used in this study, utilizes a microwave cavity as a cracking cell to produce nitrogen radicals, which in turn reduce the growth temperature. Trimethylgallium (TMGa), nitrogen (N 2) and cyclopentadienyl <b>manganese</b> <b>tricarbonyl</b> (CpMnT) were used {{as a source of}} Ga, N and Mn, respectively, while hydrogen gas was used as a carrier gas for both TMGa and CpMnT. The effect of growth temperature and Mn incorporation on structural properties and surface morphology of GaN:Mn films are presented. The growth of GaN:Mn thin films were conducted at varied growth temperature in range of 625 oC to 700 oC and the Mn/Ga molar fraction in the range of 0. 2 to 0. 5. Energy dispersive of X-ray (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) methods were used to analyze atomic composition and crystal structure of the grown films, respectively. The surface morphology was then characterized using both atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. A systematic XRD analysis reveal that maximum Mn incorporation that still produces single phase GaN:Mn (0002) is 6. 4 % and 3. 2 % for the film grown at 650 oC and 700 oC, respectively. The lattice constant and full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the single phase films depend on the Mn concentration. The decrease in lattice constant accompanied by the increase in FWHM is due to incorporation of substitutional Mn on the Ga sub-lattice. The maximum values of doped Mn atoms incorporated in the wurtzite structure of GaN:Mn as substitutional atoms on Ga sub-lattice are 2. 0 % and 2. 5 % at 650 oC and 700 oC, respectively.
