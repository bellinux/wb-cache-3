40|$|The {{current crisis}} in the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) was caused by strong divergences in wages, unit labour costs and prices {{resulting}} in member states running large current account surpluses and deficits. The European Council attempted {{to respond to this}} governance gap by adopting a regulation on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances which, however, is asymmetric and hence itself imbalanced. By adopting the regulation, governments committed themselves to safeguarding a balanced development of unit labour costs, and hence of wages, which however are the responsibility of independent social partners, creating a so far unresolved tension. In order to address this shortcoming, this study describes a number of options. The option, which here is considered first best, advocates stronger centralization and coordination of the wage-setting process, underpinned by counter-cyclical fiscal policy and an effective competition policy. As means to implement the greater coordination implied by this option, in addition to the already existing <b>Macroeconomic</b> <b>Dialogue</b> at European level, a special <b>Macroeconomic</b> <b>Dialogue</b> on national level as well as on EMU level is called for...|$|E

50|$|When European Union (EU) {{suffered}} from {{the high rate of}} unemployment, there was brilliant performances in terms of macroeconomic development and employment rate in Austria, Denmark, Ireland and Holland at the 1990s. Take 2001 for example, the unemployment rate of other 15 countries in EU was up to 7.4 percent. On the contrary, the unemployment rate of these four countries was merely 3.5 percent. ILO thought that the main reason of these four countries’ success was social <b>dialogue,</b> <b>macroeconomic</b> policies and labor market policies. For instance, the Wassenaar Agreement signed in Holland in 1982, and Denmark advocated the national recovery program with Ireland in 1987. These agreements stood for the will of social partner to solve economic dilemma.|$|R

40|$|Includes BibliographyForeword Alicia BárcenaThis book {{shows how}} {{international}} policy cooperation can be beneficial {{even in the}} absence of strong real transmission channels between countries. “Cooperation for learning”, the approach to cooperation we present, works by allowing policymakers to exchange experiences and jointly learn how to address regular common policymaking challenges posed by different types of uncertainty. Such cooperation is based on the establishment of links between policymakers and other institutions. International organizations like the United Nations can nurture and support such learning networks. In Latin America, ECLAC created such a network, called the <b>Macroeconomic</b> <b>Dialogue</b> Network (REDIMA), during a period of significant opportunities and challenges posed by the “commodities” boom period that preceded the international financial crisis of 2008 - 2010. The experience of REDIMA described in the book presents a real-world example of how “cooperation for learning” can provide real value added to policymakers while also setting the bases for future regional cooperation and integration efforts.

40|$|European {{monetary}} union is unique. Monetary policy is centralised at the supranational level, {{but many other}} policies with macroeconomic impact remain at the national level. Because price stability is driven by unit labour costs, wage bargaining has become Europeanized {{with the creation of}} the euro. While the experience of the last 10 years has shown that wage bargaining on aggregate has supported monetary policy, national wage settlements have diverged and there is only very weak evidence of convergence to the euro average. The reasons are found in insufficient consideration of the euro-wide macroeconomic environment in national wage bargaining and the absence of European-wide public debates on wage setting. This poses {{the problem of how to}} remedy the situation. Classical indicators of labour market flexibility do not seem to be relevant. The <b>Macroeconomic</b> <b>Dialogue</b> was instituted to facilitate macroeconomic stability. It has failed, largely because of its confidential nature, which prevents the emergence of European-wide policy deliberation.

40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis {{has caused the}} need for a stronger positioning of the European Court of Justice in the new model of economic governance in the European Union. The Jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice contributes in creating the optimal legal control mechanism of budget spending in the European monetary law and ensure maintenance of euro-zone fiscal framework. The role of the European Court of Justice in the EMU in earlier periods was secondary, but in times of crisis, it points to the growing need of Jurisdiction's extending in the field of monetary relations between member states and respect of convergence rules. Court's Jurisdiction in resolving of monetary and fiscal disputes is increasingly implemented in determining the legal nature of international agreements, whose ratio is economic stability, where the Judgments regarding complementarities of these legal documents with primary law provisions have the crucial impact on the future direction of national fiscal policies coordination. Although, the Court's Jurisdiction in this area is still underdeveloped and Judgments are often conditioned by pragmatism reasons, by development of credible <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>dialogue</b> between Court of Justice, European Central Bank and European Court of Auditors may establish conditions for fullfiling legal gaps in the performance of monetary and fiscal Jurisdiction of the Court...|$|E
40|$|The European social dialogue, {{which is}} the name given to the bipartite/tripartite work of the {{representative}} social partner organizations, has evolved significantly since it was first introduced in 1985 and constitutes one of the pillars of the European Union (artt. 137 - 139 of the Treaty establishing the European Community). The European dialogue, {{which is based on}} the principles of responsibility, solidarity and participation, is now structured within the governance of the Union and allows the social partners to make an important contribution to the definition of European social standards (COM(2002) 341 final; COM(2004) 557 final). However, the system of social partnership and independent social dialogue in some of the Member States and candidate countries has proved to be rather weak: joint opinions, declarations and recommendations (which in most cases do not include provisions for implementation and monitoring) are not generally known and their dissemination at national level has been limited. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore how European social discourse (analysed from a corpus of EU texts organized in a diachronic perspective) succeeds/fails in introducing a more general change in governance, viz. a new technology/means of governance based upon principles/values (such as ‘accountability’, ‘transparency’, ‘accessibility’, ‘appropriateness’, ‘equal opportunity’) which are highly problematic, culture-sensitive/context-bound concepts. From this point of view, EU social dialogue will be presented as: i) a ‘nodal discourse’ (Fairclough 2006) articulating together different discourses (recognizable in numerous buzzwords: new-generation texts, lifelong-learning, genuine partnership, corporate social responsibility, eEurope, <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>dialogue,</b> Lisbon strategy, teleworking); ii) a strategy for socio-economic/political change, in which the extent and success of EU social challenges (i. e., ‘The international dimension of the social dialogue’; ‘Integration of the Financial markets and coordination of macroeconomic policies’; ‘The technological challenge’, ‘Making Europe more competitive’) will depend upon the political, socio-economic and cultural aspects and values of the groups and actors involved...|$|E
40|$|The Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is an {{economic}} and monetary policy system based on a fundamental asymmetry and consisting of three elements: 1. an independent central bank (ECB) which is exclusively charged with monetary policy in the euro zone; 2. economic policies (fiscal and budgetary policies) which continue to be pursued individually at member state level but which are subject to specified common rules (specifically the stability and growth pact (SGP), the procedure {{in the case of}} an excessive deficit and the acquis communautaire of the single market); and, finally, 3. recognition that economic policies by the member states are a matter of "common concern" which consequently need some amount of co-ordination at Council level. The ECB pursues its monetary policy at central level for all members of the euro zone. Its primary objective is to achieve price stability in the euro zone. In its monetary policy strategy, the ECB concentrates on three key elements: a quantitative definition of price stability as the chief goal of the euro system (defined by the ECB as an inflation rate of not more than 2 percent), and a "two-pillar concept". For the "first pillar", a reference value of 4. 5 percent was specified for the growth of the money supply (M 3). The "second pillar" includes a whole bundle of business indicators in order to obtain adequate forecasts of inflation. In spite of an unfavourable international situation (oil price shock of 2000 - 01, global recession in 2001 - 02), the ECB was successful in shaping its monetary policy. EMU has not only revolutionised monetary policy but has also left a marked impression on the fiscal stability culture in the EU. The obligation to meet the convergence criteria alone has already reduced budget deficits in the EU markedly below 3 percent of GDP. With the entry into the third stage of EMU, the trend was further enhanced, not least due to the dictates of the stability and growth pact. Whereas in 1997 (prior to EMU entry) only three of the 15 EU member states (Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg) boasted of a budget surplus, their number had grown to nine countries in 2001. This not only interrupted the dynamic growth of the national debt but also contributed to making state finances more sustainable. But although the stability and growth pact fostered greater fiscal policy discipline, it still shows its inherent weaknesses in times of weak growth or recession. With competences clearly allocated (ECB exclusively in charge of monetary policy and EU member states in charge of economic policy), economic policy needs to be co-ordinated. Over time, complex mechanisms and a number of processes have been established (Luxembourg process for employment, Cardiff process for structural policy and functioning of the single market, Cologne process for <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>dialogue,</b> Lisbon process for an open method of co-ordination). An annual rhythm of multilateral monitoring has been formed within the scope of the pact, accompanied by the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines (BEPG). It is an open issue whether this elaborate (administrative, political) process does not already cancel out possible gains of co-ordination. In view of such findings, any demand for further and stronger co-ordination made (e. g. by the Commission) to the European Convention currently discussing the future Europe would thus be rather contra productive. It is especially in comparing the USA and EU in terms of their economic performance over the past decade that an analysis of the complex economic policy interactions within EMU may well lead to the conclusion that not only are labour and capital markets in the EU still too rigid but that its economic policy is still too inflexible.

40|$|Includes bibliographyThis work {{attempts}} to assemble and synthesize some {{results of the}} first phase (2000 - 2003) of the REDIMA project implemented in Latin America by ECLAC {{in cooperation with the}} European Commission, which provided technical support as well as co-financing for the project. REDIMA is the acronym of the Spanish and Portuguese name of the <b>Macroeconomic</b> <b>Dialogue</b> Network (Red de Diálogo Macroeconómico), which was conceived and implemented in the three main subregions of Latin America between the end of 2000 and end of 2003 by the ECLAC- United Nations headquarters in Santiago, Chile. This volume is intended mainly for Latin American experts involved in setting the macroeconomic policies of their respective countries, but it should also be of interest to a broader public concerned with regional integration options and strategies. It aims to provide some useful elements for addressing specific issues related to coordinating policies among sovereign nations in a world undergoing globalization and subject to increasing uncertainty. It is not constructed as an analytic treatise. The book has a twofold objective: to provide clear positions regarding options for Latin American integration (on the basis of the author's personal analysis, which, in turn, stems from his own professional experience both at the European Union and in Latin America), and to publicize the REDIMA experiment, as well as the momentum behind it and the proposals issued through it. In addition, the book hopes to elicit reactions from readers and promote an exchange of ideas among policy makers, experts and citizens, and thus encourage the formulation of feasible courses of action in Latin America. More than arriving at normative conclusions, my purpose in staking out positions and debating issues is to encourage endogenous processes appropriate to each subregion and use the experience gained by REDIMA. The book is structured as follows: given the theoretical results and the indisputable fact that the greatest obstacle to policy coordination lies in the lack of appropriate consensus-based models for understanding reality (underlying models) -a problem which has no short-run solution- attention is focused on practical examples and on the attempts frequently made in this direction (the Bretton Woods system, the Group of Seven [G- 7], the European Monetary System [EMS] and the European Economic and Monetary Union [EMU], in which the euro is the common currency) to draw some initial lessons (chapter I). This effort also examines the prisoner's dilemma situation that hinders cooperation (chapters II and III). The examples given in these chapters make it possible to pinpoint the specific elements behind the success of the European experiment of encouraging national decision makers to welcome cooperative strategies (chapter IV). The European Union case shows that escaping planned "centralist coordination" through successive "trials and errors" -a pragmatic scheme based on a dialogue between autonomous actors gradually creating mutual trust- and recognizing that each government legitimately tends to act in its own interest made it possible to arrive at a minimum consensus regarding the content of policies and at an acceptance of some basic common rules. In the European process, this kind of dialogue stimulated self-discipline to protect countries' own legitimate national interests (market-based rewards for or sanctions against national political decision makers). Next, the book {{attempts to}} identify the essential principles allowing the prisoner's dilemma to be overcome (chapter V). In the European case, rather than being devised according to a broad institutional plan, the solution emerged from the development of personal contacts among policy makers within a collective effort to monitor each economy from a regional perspective, thereby allowing it to be viewed as a continuous game, which, it was hoped, would enhance the credibility of domestic policies. This multi-faceted approach created specific incentives for individual participants to cooperate at the regional level, thereby creating a positive-sum game in which the positive outcome increased with the iteration of the game. Hence, the prisoner's dilemma was resolved through the dynamics of the game: that players had to meet over a long and undefined period, that they could not escape the consequences their decisions had on fellow participants, that the incentives to defect diminished over time and were commensurate with the strengthening of integration, that players learned more and more about each other, that rewards and sanctions were administered progressively and allowed the balance of benefits and costs to be identified, reducing uncertainty regarding the results of cooperation -all these factors implied that the cost of non-cooperation rose rapidly with time, and positive outcomes increased with the iteration of the game. Next, the applicability of these general principles to Latin America is examined, allowing the REDIMA political-economy approach to be introduced (chapter VI). In particular, the contextual differences between the European and Latin American integration processes are examined. This leads to an identification of the three essential obstacles to regional cooperation in Latin America (chapter VII). The book builds on these elements to present the key guidelines stemming from the REDIMA political-economy approach for escaping the prisoner's dilemma (chapter VIII). To conclude on a practical note, the preceding analysis is summarized through an examination of exchange-rate regimes (ERRs) and policies, in order to formulate some concrete proposals for debate (chapter IX). In particular, since "corner solutions" for the choice of exchangerate regime imply either a lack of flexibility or a lack of robustness, a regional cooperation scheme could, under specific conditions, provide the countervailing powers, or "checks and balances", that would lend credibility without a loss of flexibility. To complement this information, Phase 1 of the REDIMA project and its implementation are briefly evaluated (chapter X). "...|$|E
