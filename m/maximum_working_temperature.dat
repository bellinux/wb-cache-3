50|$|The {{efficiency}} of a thermal power cycle {{is limited by}} the <b>maximum</b> <b>working</b> fluid <b>temperature</b> produced. The efficiency is not directly a function of the fuel used. For the same steam conditions, coal-, nuclear- and gas power plants all have the same theoretical efficiency. Overall, if a system is on constantly (base load) it will be more efficient than one that is used intermittently (peak load). Steam turbines generally operate at higher efficiency when operated at full capacity.|$|R

Optimum combinations of Pev and DT were calculated for each one of these four objective functions for two working fluids (R 134 a, R 141 b), three source temperatures and three values of the non-dimensional power output.

50|$|When diving {{cylinders}} {{are filled}} the gas inside them warms {{as a result}} of adiabatic heating. When the gas cools by losing heat to the surroundings, the pressure will drop as described by the general gas equation and Gay-Lussac's law. Divers, to maximise their dive time, generally want their cylinders filled to their safe capacity, the working pressure. To provide the diver with a cylinder filled to the working pressure at the nominal temperature of 15 or 20 °C, the cylinder and gas must be kept cool when filling or filled to a pressure such that when it cools it is at the working pressure. This is known as the developed pressure for the filling temperature. Health and safety regulations and pressure vessel design standards may limit the working temperature of the cylinder, commonly to 65 °C, in which case the cylinder must be filled slowly enough to avoid exceeding the <b>maximum</b> <b>working</b> <b>temperature.</b> Cylinders are often filled at a rate of less than 1 bar (100 kPa or 15 lbf/in²) per second to allow time for heat transfer to the surroundings to limit this increase in temperature. As a method to remove heat faster when filling the cylinder, some filling stations “wet fill” cylinders immersed in a bath of cold water. There is an increased risk of internal cylinder corrosion caused by moisture from the wet environment entering the cylinder due to contamination during connection of the filling hose during wet filling.|$|E

5|$|Cylinder working {{pressure}} is specified at a reference temperature, usually 15°C or 20°C. and cylinders {{also have a}} specified <b>maximum</b> safe <b>working</b> <b>temperature,</b> often 65°C. The actual pressure in the cylinder will vary with temperature, as described by the gas laws, but this is acceptable {{in terms of the}} standards provided that the developed pressure when corrected to the reference temperature does not exceed the specified {{working pressure}} stamped on the cylinder. This allows cylinders to be safely and legally filled to a pressure that is higher than the specified working pressure when the filling temperature is greater than the reference temperature, but not more than 65°C, provided that the filling pressure does not exceed the developed pressure for that temperature, and cylinders filled according to this provision will be at the correct working pressure when cooled to the reference temperature.|$|R

The engine and alternator were hermetically sealed and used toluene as the working fluid. The turbine, alternator, and feed pump (TAP) were mounted on a single shaft operating at speeds up to 60, 000 rev/min.

The primary causes of bearing wear problems were traced to a combination of rotordynamic instability and electrodynamic discharge across the bearing surfaces caused by recirculating currents from the PMA. These problems were resolved by implementing an externally supplied, flooded-bearing lubrication system and by electrically insulating all bearings from the TAP housing.

As higher solar receiver output temperatures are necessary for higher thermal cycle efficiency, current CSP research is focused on high outlet temperature and high efficiency receivers. The objective {{of this study is}} to provide a simplified model to analyze the thermal efficiency of multi-cavity concentrating solar power receivers. The model calculates an optimal aperture flux that maximizes the local efficiency, constrained by a <b>maximum</b> receiver <b>working</b> <b>temperature.</b> Using this flux, the thermal efficiency, receiver temperature, and heat transfer fluid (HTF) temperature are calculated based upon an optimized flux distribution. The model also provides receiver design and HTF heat transfer requirements to achieve the necessary overall thermal efficiency.

The case study receiver design had an effective absorptivity of 99. 8 %, and was modeled with conservative values for thermal constraints. It was found that a HTF with a minimum convection coefficient between 250 and 500 W m− 2 K− 1, depending on the convective heat transfer to the environment, is necessary to achieve a thermal efficiency greater than 90 % for the receiver.
