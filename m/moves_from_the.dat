5|$|Digestion {{can take}} a long time. The food <b>moves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mouth to a J-shaped stomach, where it is stored and initial {{digestion}} occurs. Unwanted items may never get past the stomach, and instead the shark either vomits or turns its stomachs inside out and ejects unwanted items from its mouth.|$|E
5|$|The USS Slater (DE-766), {{which is}} the only {{destroyer}} escort still afloat in the United States, sits at Steamboat Square near the foot of Madison Avenue. The ship is open from April to November to the public. The destroyer closes to the public from December to March and <b>moves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Steamboat Square to the port's Rensselaer side. In August 2008 part of the Japanese film Orion in Midsummer (scheduled for release in spring 2009) was filmed on board.|$|E
5|$|The {{mobile phone}} port {{includes}} many parkour <b>moves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> PC and console versions, however, the perspective is shifted from {{first person to}} third person. The game does not feature cutscenes, and the plot is explained with scrolling text in between levels. The iOS version has since {{been removed from the}} app store due to problems with the game on iOS 8.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{fuel filter}} <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wing {{to the top}} of the {{thermostat}} housing. <b>The</b> oil filler <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> crankcase cover to the dipstick housing. The front indicators were originally combined with the headlights, but later replaced by side lights (<b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> headlight reflector) and separate indicators were fitted in the bumper.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> player must <b>move</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{room to the}} entrance. If {{they have}} any {{remaining}} actions, they may immediately use their next action to <b>move</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> entrance into the adjacent room.|$|R
50|$|Democrat Tim Walz, who has {{represented}} Minnesota's 1st congressional district since 2007, sought re-election. In redistricting, Murray County, Pipestone County {{and half of}} Cottonwood County were <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1st district to the 7th and Wabasha County was <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1st district to the 2nd; while Le Sueur County and most of Rice County were <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 2nd district to the 1st. The 1st district was expected to continue to slightly favor Republicans.|$|R
5|$|Flying {{insects that}} {{parasitise}} common starlings include the louse-fly Omithomya nigricornis and the saprophagous fly Camus hemapterus. The latter species breaks off the feathers of its host and {{lives on the}} fats produced by growing plumage. Larvae of the moth Hofmannophila pseudospretella are nest scavengers, which feed on animal material such as faeces or dead nestlings. Protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus {{have been found in}} common starlings, but a better known pest is the brilliant scarlet nematode Syngamus trachea. This worm <b>moves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lungs to the trachea and may cause its host to suffocate. In Britain, the rook and the common starling are the most infested wild birds. Other recorded internal parasites include the spiny-headed worm Prosthorhynchus transverses.|$|E
5|$|Musical notes {{return in}} Banjo-Tooie, but are now used {{to learn new}} moves from Bottles' brother, the drill {{sergeant}} Jamjars, who assumes Bottles' role from the first game. All of Banjo and Kazooie's <b>moves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first game are immediately accessible in Banjo-Tooie, and the player can acquire several new moves such as first-person aiming, new egg types, {{and the ability to}} play as Banjo and Kazooie separately, with each gaining moves they can only use while on their own. Mumbo Jumbo also returns, this time as a playable character who can venture out into each world and use specific magic spells to help Banjo and Kazooie proceed. Taking over Mumbo's previous role of transforming the duo into different forms is Humba Wumba, a Native American woman who acts as Mumbo's rival.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} original woodwork, sills, door frames, {{and interior}} doors, are all solid oak. The interior walls are 12inches thick and, either painted or covered with paneling. An open, double staircase leads {{from the first}} floor to {{the second and third}} floors and the center of the building houses an elevator which <b>moves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> basement to the third floor. The interior floors are all white pine wood, though some of the floors have now been carpeted. First floor ceilings are 15feet high, with doors at a height of 12feet. The second floor features the courtrooms, which, through the 1980s remodel, had the ceilings lowered to 10feet. The interior renovation was completed at a cost of US$1.5 million.|$|E
50|$|In re{{district}}ing, Le Sueur County and Rice County were <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 2nd {{district to}} the 1st and Carver County was <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 2nd district to the 3rd and 6th; while West St. Paul {{and parts of}} South St. Paul were <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 4th district to the 2nd. The 2nd district was made slightly more favorable to Democrats, but continues to favor Republicans. Despite a strong challenge from Obermueller, Kline prevailed.|$|R
25|$|In 629, Emperor Gaozu <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> main palace, Taiji Palace (太極殿) to the {{subsidiary}} Hongyi Palace (弘義宮), {{which was}} then renamed Da'an Palace (大安宮). Only then was Emperor Taizong able to <b>move</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> crown prince's palace to Taiji Palace.|$|R
50|$|Flickiidae {{has been}} {{divided into two}} subfamilies, the Flickiinae, which is {{equivalent}} to the Flickiidae of the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, Part L, 1957 and the Salaziceratinae which contains Salaziceras, <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Lyelliceratidae and Neosaynoceras, <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Acanthoceratidae.|$|R
5|$|Wind {{is caused}} by {{differences}} in the atmospheric pressure. When a difference in atmospheric pressure exists, air <b>moves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> higher to the lower pressure area, resulting in winds of various speeds. On a rotating planet, air will also be deflected by the Coriolis effect, except exactly on the equator. Globally, the two major driving factors of large-scale wind patterns (the atmospheric circulation) are the differential heating between the equator and the poles (difference in absorption of solar energy leading to buoyancy forces) and {{the rotation of the}} planet. Outside the tropics and aloft from frictional effects of the surface, the large-scale winds tend to approach geostrophic balance. Near the Earth's surface, friction causes the wind to be slower than it would be otherwise. Surface friction also causes winds to blow more inward into low-pressure areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{circulation}} {{patterns in}} the upper mesosphere and thermosphere of Venus are completely different {{from those in the}} lower atmosphere. At altitudes 90–150km the Venusian air <b>moves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dayside to nightside of the planet, with upwelling over sunlit hemisphere and downwelling over dark hemisphere. The downwelling over the nightside causes adiabatic heating of the air, which forms a warm layer in the nightside mesosphere at the altitudes 90–120km. The temperature of this layer—230K (−43°C) is far higher than the typical temperature found in the nightside thermosphere—100K (−173°C). The air circulated from the dayside also carries oxygen atoms, which after recombination form excited molecules of oxygen in the long-lived singlet state (1Δg), which then relax and emit infrared radiation at the wavelength 1.27μm. This radiation from the altitude range 90–100km is often observed from the ground and spacecraft. The nightside upper mesosphere and thermosphere of Venus is also the source of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium emissions of CO2 and nitric oxide molecules, which are responsible for the low temperature of the nightside thermosphere.|$|E
5|$|The film {{references}} Resident Evil, {{with the}} crash site of the helicopter being located in the Arklay Forest near the Arklay Mountains, where the Resident Evil series began. Other similarities include Jill's <b>moves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first game. The recording of Terri's death is similar to Kenneth's death. A white goddess statue {{can be seen in}} the church, with artwork of goddesses having a large role in the puzzles of the Resident Evil series. Whilst walking on the Arklay Overpass, Jill speculates that there is no way out, and that Ashford may just be watching them on the cameras, as if the whole thing were some sort of sick game. The games use a fixed camera perspective, which in most of the earlier games resembles a mounted camera's perspective. Another similarity includes a scene where Jill finds a gun under a pew, mirroring the game when the player finds ammunition or weapons in certain areas.|$|E

25|$|Item #1 {{rules out}} the outer reaches of a galaxy; #2 and #3 rule out galactic inner regions. As one <b>moves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{center of a}} galaxy to its furthest extremity, the ability to support life rises then falls. Hence the galactic {{habitable}} zone may be ring-shaped, sandwiched between its uninhabitable center and outer reaches.|$|E
25|$|When a {{hand loom}} {{was located in}} the home, {{children}} helped with the weaving process from an early age. Piecing needs dexterity, and a child can be as productive as an adult. When weaving <b>moves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> home to the mill, children are often allowed to help their older sisters, and laws {{have to be made}} to prevent child labour becoming established.|$|E
25|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) has {{produced}} a six-stage classification that describes {{the process by which}} a novel influenza virus <b>moves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first few infections in humans through to a pandemic. This starts with the virus mostly infecting animals, with a few cases where animals infect people, then moves through the stage where the virus begins to spread directly between people, and ends with a pandemic when infections from the new virus have spread worldwide.|$|E

25|$|The focus then <b>moves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lectern to the font. Anciently, Easter was {{considered}} the ideal time for converts to receive baptism, and this practice continues within Roman Catholicism and the Anglican Communion. Whether there are baptisms at this point or not, it is traditional for the congregation to renew the vows of their baptismal faith. This act is often sealed by the sprinkling of the congregation with holy water from the font. The Catholic sacrament of Confirmation is also celebrated at the Vigil.|$|E
25|$|Davis ordered Iroquois; {{the ship}} {{closest to the}} contact, {{commanded}} by James Calcutt Hibbard to use the Type 293 radar and relay {{the information to the}} rest of the force. Hibbard placed so much confidence in the radar that he decided to direct the opening <b>moves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Action Information Centre rather than the bridge, and then gave the order to illuminate with starshell. As a result, Force 27 was able to close undetected and launched a surprise attack on the known convoy which were three ships.|$|E
