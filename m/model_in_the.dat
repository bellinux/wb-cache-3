The theory {{interest}} group <b>in</b> <b>the</b> International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) has {{the goal of}} ensuring that theoretical data and services {{are taken into account}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> IVOA standards process. In this poster we present some of the efforts carried out by this group to include evolutionary synthesis <b>models</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> VO framework. <b>In</b> particular we present the VO tool PGos 3, developed by the INAOE (Mexico) and the Spanish Virtual Observatory which includes most of public SSP <b>models</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> VO framework (e. g. VOSpec). We also describe the problems related with the inclusion of synthesis <b>models</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> VO framework and we try to encourage people to define <b>the</b> way <b>in</b> which synthesis <b>models</b> should be described. This issue has implications not only for the inclusion of synthesis <b>models</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> the VO framework but also for a proper usage of synthesis models...|$|R

5|$|An {{improvement}} of the CFM56-5A series, it was originally designed to power the A321. With a thrust range between 22,000 and 33,000lbf (98kN and 147kN) it can power every <b>model</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> A320 family (A318/A319/A320/A321) and has superseded the CFM56-5A series. Among the changes from the CFM56-5A is the option of a double-annular combustor that reduces emissions (particularly NOx), a new fan in a longer fan case, and a new low-pressure compressor with a fourth stage (up from three in earlier variants). It is the most numerous engine supplied to Airbus.|$|E
5|$|By {{that year}} the bikini made up nearly 20% of {{swimsuit}} sales, {{more than any}} other <b>model</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US. As skin cancer awareness grew and a simpler aesthetic defined fashion in the 1990s, sales of the skimpy bikini decreased dramatically. The new swimwear code was epitomized by surf star Malia Jones, who appeared on the June 1997 cover of Shape Magazine wearing a halter top two-piece for rough water. After the 90s, however, the bikini came back again. US market research company NPD Group reported that sales of two-piece swimsuits nationwide jumped 80% in two years. On one hand the one-piece made a big comeback in the 1980s and early 1990s, on the other bikinis became briefer with the string bikini in the 1970s and 80s.|$|E

5|$|Goldman pursued an {{independent}} education on her own, however, and {{soon began to}} study the political turmoil around her, particularly the Nihilists responsible for assassinating Alexander II of Russia. The ensuing turmoil intrigued Goldman, although she did not fully understand it at the time. When she read Chernyshevsky's novel, What Is to Be Done? (1863), she found a role <b>model</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> protagonist Vera, who adopts a Nihilist philosophy and escapes her repressive family to live freely and organize a sewing cooperative. The book enthralled Goldman and remained {{a source of inspiration}} throughout her life.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the video arcade games, Sega Enterprises, Inc. (USA) created a Crazy Taxi themed redemption game which was released in 2003. The player had to roll their coin or token down the sloped playing surface past a moving taxi <b>model</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center of the playing field in order to hit one of eight targets (representing passengers) at the far end. Passengers were worth different points, from which the operator would then set the number of tickets to be won. The game incorporated music and sounds from the video games.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{second to}} the 747 as Boeing's most {{profitable}} jetliner, the 777 became the company's most lucrative <b>model</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2000s. Program sales accounted for an estimated US$400million of Boeing's pretax earnings in 2000, US$50million more than the 747. By 2004, the airliner comprised the bulk of wide-body revenues for the Boeing Commercial Airplanes division. In 2007, orders for second-generation 777 models approached 350 aircraft, and in November of that year, Boeing announced that all production slots were sold out to 2012. The program backlog of 356 orders was valued at US$95billion at list prices in 2008.|$|E

5|$|Researchers {{focus on}} {{various aspects of}} {{cognitive}} theory to explain the seductive details effect. Seductive details impose an extraneous cognitive load during learning by enticing students to spend their limited resources in processing materials that distract from, or disrupt, {{the construction of a}} coherent mental <b>model</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> learning process. Most studies use seductive details in science text to demonstrate the extraneous cognitive load. However, there are contrasting studies done with non-scientific texts that did not produce the same results. These results may suggest that seductive details can only interfere with learning within a high load learning process that requires managing the available cognitive resources. In learning situations that are associated with low working memory activity, seductive details did not have a detrimental effect. They can even lead to higher performance because there are the required cognitive resources available for the motivating function.|$|E
5|$|The 8 {{compartment}} Bühlmann - based UWATEC ZH-L8 ADT MB PMG decompression <b>model</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Scubapro Galileo dive computer processes {{the dive}} profile and suggests an intermediate 2-minute stop {{that is a}} function of the tissue nitrogen loading at that time, taking into account the accumulated nitrogen from previous dives. Within the Haldanian logic of the model, at least three compartments are offgassing at the prescribed depth - the 5 and 10 minute half time compartments under a relatively high pressure gradient. Therefore, for decompression dives, the existing obligation is not increased during the stop.|$|E
