40|$|Multi-user {{detection}} {{allows for}} the efficient use of bandwidth in Code-Division Multiple-Access (CDMA) channels through mitigation of near-far effects and multiple-access noise limitations. Due to its inherent noise and <b>multipath</b> <b>immunity,</b> CDMA multi-access is being considered as a platform for personal communication systems (PCS). As CDMA based digital communication networks proliferate, the need to determine {{the presence of a}} new user and integrate knowledge of this new user into the detection scheme becomes more important. The decorrelating detector is a linear multi-user detector that is asymptotically optimal in terms of near far resistance; however, {{in the presence of a}} new unknown user, performance of the decorrelator is severely degraded. Adaptive decorrelators are constructed which adaptively augment an existing conventional decorrelator to demodulate a new active user in addition to existing users. Several likelihood ratio based schemes are employed. Both synchronous and asyn [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Short-range {{wireless}} communication {{has become an}} essential part of everyday life thanks to the enormous growth in the deployment of wireless local and personal area networks. However, traditional wireless technology cannot meet the requirements of upcoming wireless services that demand high-data rates to operate. This issue has motivated an unprecedented resurgence of ultra-wideband (UWB) technology, a transmission technique that is based on the emission of sub-nanosecond pulses with a very low transmitted power. Because of the particular characteristics of UWB signals, very high data rates can be provided with <b>multipath</b> <b>immunity</b> and high penetration capabilities. Nevertheless, formidable challenges must be faced in order to fulfill the expectations of UWB technology. One of the most important challenges is to cope with the overwhelming distortion introduced by the intricate propagation physics of UWB signals. In addition to this, UWB antennas behave like direction-sensitive filters such that the signal driving the transmit antenna, the electric far field, and the signal across the receiver load, they all may differ considerably in wave shape. As a result, the well-known and popular concept of matched filter correlatio...|$|E
40|$|Ultra-wideband (UWB), {{also known}} as impulse or carrier-free radio technology, is one {{promising}} new technology. In February 2002, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the deployment of this technology. It is increasingly recognized that UWB technology holds great potential to provide significant benefits in many terrestrial and space applications such as precise positioning/tracking and high data rate mobile wireless communications. This talk presents an introduction to UWB technology and some applications on space exploration. UWB is characterized by several uniquely attractive features, such as low impact on other RF systems due to its extremely low power spectral densities, immunity to interference from narrow band RF systems due to its ultra-wide bandwidth, <b>multipath</b> <b>immunity</b> to fading due to ample multipath diversity, capable of precise positioning due to fine time resolution, capable of high data rate multi-channel performance. The related FCC regulations, IEEE standardization efforts and industry activities also will be addressed in this talk. For space applications, some projects currently under development at NASA Johnson Space Center will be introduced. These include the UWB integrated communication and tracking system for Lunar/Mars rover and astronauts, UWB-RFID ISS inventory tracking, and UWB-TDOA close-in high resolution tracking for potential applications on robonaut...|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} discusses {{a design}} effort for a prototype ultra-wideband (UWB) tracking {{system that is}} currently under development at NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC). The system is being studied for use in tracking of lunar/Mars rovers during early exploration missions when satellite navigation systems are not available. The UWB technology is exploited to implement the tracking system due to its properties such as fine time resolution, low power spectral density and <b>multipath</b> <b>immunity.</b> A two cluster prototype design using commercially available UWB radios is employed to implement the Angle of Arrival (AOA) tracking methodology in this design effort. In order to increase the tracking range, low noise amplifiers (LNA) and high gain horns are used at the receiving sides. Field tests were conducted jointly with the Science and Crew Operation Utility Testbed (SCOUT) vehicle near the Meteor Crater in Arizona to test the tracking capability for a moving target in an operational environment. These tests demonstrate that the UWB tracking system can co-exist with other on-board radio frequency (RF) communication systems (such as Global Positioning System (GPS), video, voice and telemetry systems), and that a tracking resolution less than 1 % of the range can be achieved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} the dynamic spot diffusing (DSD) conguration for high-speed indoor wireless optical com-munications. In this conguration, data are modulated onto a moving spot which is translated over the ceiling. A multi-element imaging receiver is pointed upward and acquires data whenever the transmitter spot {{is in its}} eld-of-view (FOV). We develop expressions for the channel capacity of such DSD links and discuss design techniques to maximize these information theoretic bounds. Rather than tracking the transmitter spot, we apply rateless erasure correcting codes to approach {{the capacity of the}} simulated DSD links. This technique is demonstrated to have better exibility, greater <b>multipath</b> <b>immunity,</b> higher data rates and simpler transmitters than previously dened multi-spot and diffuse architectures. In a 6 × 6 × 3 m room, simulated data rates vary between 7 Mbps to 25 Mbps at different positions using a single 100 Mbps transmitter and between 35 Mbps to 84 Mbps using 6 spots and the designed erasure correction code. Using power efcient modulation and power gain due to the spot motion of the DSD system, proportionally higher rates are estimated when faster 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps transmitters are employed. Index Terms—Wireless infrared channel, indoor diffuse in-frared communication, optical intensity modulation, spot diffus-ing architecture. I...|$|E

The advantages of using OFDM signals {{in order to provide}} high baud rates together with high <b>multipath</b> <b>immunity</b> has provoked a mass expansion into media systems such as DSL, DVB, Wi-Fi, WLAN, etc.. Thanks to this technology we can quarantee high modulation rates with minimal negative disturbance eects. The rst part is dedicated to characterise OFDM signals, their generation and the algorithm producing the OFDM which is implemented in DSP devices. For the purpose of using the fastest algorithm, the Fast Fourier Transform using Cooley-Tukey algorithm was shown. Before we can implement OFDM modem into the FPGA device, we have to simulate its correct function. Because there is no OFDM analyser available at our departement, its necessary to prove its correct function by simulations.

An AOA technique using the Time Difference Of Arrival (TDOA) information is utilized for location estimation in the prototype system, not only to exploit the precise time resolution possible with UWB signals, but also to {{eliminate the need for}} synchronization between the transmitter and the receiver. After the UWB radio at each cluster is used to obtain the TDOA estimates from the UWB signal sent from the target, the TDOA data is converted to AOA data to find the angle of arrival, assuming this is a far field application. Since the distance between two clusters is known, the target position is computed by a simple triangulation. Simulations show that the average tracking error at a range of 610 meters is 2. 7595 meters, less than 0. 5 % of the tracking range. Outdoor tests to track the SCOUT vehicle (The Science Crew Operations and Utility Testbed) near the Meteor Crater, Flagstaff, Arizona were performed on September 12 - 13, 2005. The tracking performance was obtained with less than 1 % tracking error at ranges up to 2000 feet. No RF interference with on-board GPS, video, voice and telemetry systems was detected. Outdoor tests demonstrated the UWB tracking capability...|$|E
