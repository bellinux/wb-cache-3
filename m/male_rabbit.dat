25|$|The series {{centers on}} a group of young cartoon {{characters}} who attend a school called Acme Looniversity to be the next generation of Looney Tunes characters. Most of the Tiny Toons characters were designed to resemble younger versions of Warner Bros.' most popular Looney Tunes animal characters by exhibiting similar traits and looks. The two main characters are both rabbits: Buster Bunny, a blue <b>male</b> <b>rabbit,</b> and Babs Bunny, a pink female rabbit not related to Buster, Plucky Duck, a green male duck, Hamton J. Pig, a pink male pig. Other major characters in the cast are generally nonhuman as well. These include Fifi La Fume, a purple-and-white female skunk; Shirley the Loon, a white female loon; Dizzy Devil, a purple tasmanian devil; Furrball, a blue cat; Sweetie Pie, a pink canary; Calamity Coyote, a bluish-gray coyote; Little Beeper, a red-orange roadrunner; and Gogo Dodo, a zany green dodo. Two human characters, Montana Max and Elmyra Duff, are regarded as the main villains of the series and also are students of Acme Looniversity. As villains, Elmyra is seen as an extreme pet lover while Montana Max is a spoiled rich brat who either owns lots of toys or polluting factories. Supporting characters included Li'l Sneezer, a gray mouse with powerful sneezes; Concord Condor, a purple condor; Byron Basset, a usually sleeping basset hound; Bookworm, a green worm with glasses; Arnold the Pit Bull, a muscular white pit bull; Fowlmouth, a white rooster with horrid language; Barky Marky, a brown dog, and Mary Melody, a young African American human girl.|$|E

Corn oil is finding wide application at home, restaurants, hotels, hospitals, and other food industries. Nowadays it is finding wide application at all places of food preparation.

40|$|Introduction: Arsenic is an {{environmental}} toxicant and a human carcinogen. Epidemiology studies link human arsenic exposure to various diseases and cancers, including liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma. From {{this point of}} view, this study is designed to investigate the effects of arsenic histologically and histochemically on the liver of adult <b>male</b> <b>rabbits.</b> Material and methods: twenty adult <b>male</b> <b>rabbits</b> were used and divided into four groups. Each group consisted of five rabbits, one group used as a control given an equivalent volume of distilled water and three groups given sodium arsenite in distilled water for 6, 12 and 18 weeks respectively. Paraffin sections from all groups prepared and stained by haematoxylin and eosin, and periodic acid-schiff. Results: histological and histochemical changes in arsenic groups were marked vacuolation of hepatocytes with focal areas of hepatocellular degeneration. Loss of hepatic architecture was also observed. Marked dilatation and congestion of the central veins and mononuclear cellular infiltration were obvious. Quantitative analysis of intracellular glycogen stores of all groups using image analyzing system revealed gradual significant depletion of intracellular glycogen stores.

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the effects of estradiol benzoate (EB) injection to <b>male</b> <b>rabbits</b> on glucose, total-protein, albumin, calcium concentrations and prostate tissue, {{and the role of}} prolactin as an important mediator of estrogen action in prostate. Materials and methods: Fifty four adult <b>male</b> <b>rabbits</b> were used in this study. The rabbits were randomly divided into two groups. Group A contained 36 <b>male</b> <b>rabbits,</b> which were further randomly divided into four sub-groups, three of them contained 10 rabbits and one sub-group contained 6 rabbits as control. Group B contained 18 <b>male</b> <b>rabbits,</b> which were divided randomly into three equal sub-groups. Three sub-groups of Groups A and B were treated once each on alternative day with the intramuscular injections of EB dosed at 40, 80 and 120 µg/rabbit, respectively for 20 days, whereas the fourth sub-group of Group A received no estradiol, and Group B received 1 mg Bromocriptine Mesilate in addition to EB through oral route on each alternative day. Blood samples were collected for measuring glucose, t-protein, albumin and calcium levels. Prostate tissue samples were collected from all the rabbits for histological studies. Results: Glucose was significantly (P&# 706; 0. 05) increased as a result of 80 µg EB injection, while significantly (P&# 706; 0. 05) decreased due to 40 and 120 µg EB injection. Total protein significantly (P&# 706; 0. 05) increased due to injection of 40 µg EB, however t-protein was not changed due to 40 and 120 µg injection. On the other hand, the results of albumin and calcium were not affected (P&# 707; 0. 05) by EB. In prostate tissues, EB induced hyperplasia with dysplasia or dysplasia only, but this effect was mild due to inhibition of prolactin. Conclusion: The injection of EB to <b>male</b> <b>rabbits</b> increased or decreased glucose level, increased t-protein level mildly or not changed, while albumin and calcium levels were not affected. EB induced hyperplasia on prostate tissue, and this effect was reduced by prolactin inhibition indicating that prolactin might have a role on the action of estrogen.
