Specifically, the Royal Meteorological Society researched and investigated the ionization of the upper atmosphere, by suspending instruments on balloons or kites. At Glossop Wittgenstein worked under Professor of Physics Sir Arthur Schuster.|$|E

25|$|Convective storm {{detection}} is the <b>meteorological</b> <b>observation</b> of deep, moist convection (DMC) and {{consists of}} detection, monitoring, and short-term prediction. Convective storms can produce tornadoes as well as large hail, strong winds, and heavy rain leading to flash flooding. The detection of convective storms relies on direct eyewitness observations, for example from storm spotters; and on remote sensing, especially weather radar. Some in situ measurements are used for direct detection as well, notably, wind speed reports from surface observation stations. It {{is part of the}} integrated warning system, consisting of prediction, detection, and dissemination of information on severe weather to users such as emergency management, storm spotters and chasers, the media, and the general public.|$|E
25|$|Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier {{was born}} to a wealthy family of the nobility in Paris on 26 August 1743. The son of an {{attorney}} at the Parliament of Paris, he inherited a large fortune {{at the age of}} five upon the death of his mother. Lavoisier began his schooling at the Collège des Quatre-Nations, University of Paris (also known as the Collège Mazarin) in Paris in 1754 at the age of 11. In his last two years (1760–1761) at the school, his scientific interests were aroused, and he studied chemistry, botany, astronomy, and mathematics. In the philosophy class he came under the tutelage of Abbé Nicolas Louis de Lacaille, a distinguished mathematician and observational astronomer who imbued the young Lavoisier with an interest in <b>meteorological</b> <b>observation,</b> an enthusiasm which never left him. Lavoisier entered the school of law, where he received a bachelor's degree in 1763 and a licentiate in 1764. Lavoisier received a law degree and was admitted to the bar, but never practiced as a lawyer. However, he continued his scientific education in his spare time.|$|E

I threw up the sash, the cold air cut me like a knife.
