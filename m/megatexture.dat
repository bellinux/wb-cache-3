50|$|The {{original}} {{version of the}} id Tech 4 engine was designed for somewhat dark environments so it was criticized for its perceived inability to handle extremely large day time outdoor areas. The <b>MegaTexture</b> technology not only removed this issue by introducing a means to create expansive outdoor scenes, but also made the new version as the best game engine to handle the outdoor areas, as well. By painting a single massive texture (32,768×32,768 pixels, though it has been extended to larger dimensions in recent versions of the <b>MegaTexture</b> technology) covering the entire polygon map and highly detailed terrain, the desired effects can be achieved. The <b>MegaTexture</b> can also store physical information about the terrain such {{as the amount of}} traction in certain areas or indicate what sound effect should be played when walking over specific parts of the map. i.e. walking on rock will sound different from walking on grass. It is expected that this will result in a considerably more detailed scene than the majority of existing technologies, using tiled textures, allow. The first game utilizing <b>MegaTexture</b> is Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, based on the Tech 4 engine. All id Tech 5 and id Tech 6 games use <b>MegaTexture,</b> with the exception of The Evil Within which uses a new renderer. Brink, which uses a heavily modified version of id Tech 4 also uses virtual texturing. While the implementation is different from <b>MegaTexture,</b> it was inspired by it.|$|E

50|$|Quake Wars {{utilized}} {{a modified}} version of the id Tech 4 engine with the addition of a technology called <b>MegaTexture,</b> a new texture mapping technique developed by John D. Carmack of id Software. The technology allows maps to be totally unique, without any repeated terrain tiles. Battlefields can be rendered to the horizon without any fogging, with over a square mile of terrain at inch-level detail, while also providing terrain-type detail that defines such factors as bullet hit effects, vehicle traction, sound effects, and so on. Each <b>megatexture</b> is derived from a 32768×32768 pixel image, which takes up around 3 gigabytes in its raw form (with 3 bytes per pixel, one byte for each color channel).|$|E
50|$|Road surface textures are {{deviations}} from a planar and smooth surface, affecting the vehicle/tyre interaction. Pavement texture is divided into: microtexture with wavelengths from 0 mm to 0.5 mm, macrotexture with wavelengths from 0.5 mm to 50 mm and <b>megatexture</b> with wavelengths from 50 mm to 500 mm.|$|E

50|$|Another type of {{profilograph}} {{system is}} {{for measuring the}} surface texture of a road and how {{it relates to the}} coefficient of friction and thus to skid resistance. Pavement texture is divided into three categories; <b>megatexture,</b> macrotexture, and microtexture. Microtexture cannot currently be measured directly, except in a laboratory. <b>Megatexture</b> is measured using a similar profiling method as when obtaining IRI values, while macrotexture is the measurement of the individual variations of the road within a small interval of a few centimeters. For example, a road which has gravel spread on top followed by an asphalt seal coat will have a high macrotexture, and a road built with concrete slabs will have low macrotexture. For this reason, concrete is often grooved or roughed up immediately after it is laid on the road bed to increase the friction between the tire and road.|$|E

5000|$|... id Tech 4, {{first used}} for Doom 3 (2004), used an entirely dynamic per-pixel lighting, whereas previously, 3D engines had relied {{primarily}} on pre-calculated per-vertex lighting or lightmaps and Gouraud shading. The Shadow volume approach used in Doom 3 permitted more realistic lighting and shadows, however this {{came at a}} price as it could not render soft shadows, and the engine was primarily good indoors. Later this was rectified to work with vast outdoor spaces, {{with the introduction of}} <b>MegaTexture</b> technology in the id Tech 4 engine.|$|E
5000|$|While id Tech 4 {{had taken}} a new {{direction}} with its dynamic per-pixel lighting, this unconventional feature had steeper hardware requirements and was initially only useful in [...] "spooky games" [...] (until the <b>MegaTexture</b> addition), whereas {{an increasing number of}} developers preferred conventional engines that could render large outdoor areas. Also notable was id Tech 4's relative lack of downward scalability compared to competing FPS engines; id Tech 4 generally required a DirectX 8.0 compliant GPU such as a GeForce 3; the rival Source engine (which was developed from the previous GoldSrc engine) could still run on the older widespread DirectX 7 GPUs (albeit without shaders being used).|$|E
50|$|The initial {{demonstration}} of the engine featured 20 GB of texture data (using a more advanced <b>MegaTexture</b> approach called Virtual Texturing, which supports textures with resolutions up to 128,000 × 128,000 pixels), and a completely dynamic and changeable world. This technique allows the engine to automatically stream textures into memory as needed, meaning that developers need not concern themselves with memory restraints or texture limits. This {{has the advantage of}} simplifying the creation of content, by eliminating the need to adapt content for different platforms. The engine automatically optimizes resources for cross-platform development, making it possible to render the same models on different platforms, while creating them for only one platform, further simplifying cross-platform development.|$|E
40|$|<b>Megatexture</b> {{corresponds}} to surface irregularities with wavelengths of a pavement profile lying between 50 mm and 500 mm and vertical amplitude ranging from 0, 1 to 50 mm. Wavelengths of <b>megatexture</b> {{are the same}} order of size as tire/road interface. <b>Megatexture</b> is measured by a profilometer called RUGO (mlpc device) composed of a non-contact sensor, which measure the distance between its datum-line and the pavement surface examined. Then, the profile curve is analyzed by digital filtering technique {{in order to determine}} the magnitude of its spectral components at different wavelength. Thus, the texture spectrum of the profile is calculated with a texture level, given in dB, for each one-third-octave band and each path of measurement. This study investigates elements that may affect <b>megatexture</b> measurements like the type of captor, the speed or the operator. Experiments were realized in order to evaluate the reproducibility and the repeatability of the <b>megatexture</b> measurements following the international standard ISO 5725.

40|$|The {{research}} {{aimed to}} establish tyre-road noise models {{by using a}} Data Mining approach that allowed to build a predictive model and assess {{the importance of the}} tested input variables. The data modelling took into account three learning algorithms and three metrics to define the best predictive model. The variables tested included basic properties of pavement surfaces, macrotexture, <b>megatexture,</b> and uneven- ness and, for the first time, damping. Also, the importance of those variables was measured by using a sensitivity analysis procedure. Two types of models were set: one with basic variables and another with complex variables, such as <b>megatexture</b> and damping, all as a function of vehicles speed. More detailed models were additionally set by the speed level. As a result, several models with very good tyre-road noise predictive capacity were achieved. The most relevant variables were Speed, Temperature, Aggregate size, Mean Profile Depth, and Damping, which had the highest importance, even though influenced by speed. <b>Megatexture</b> and IRI had the lowest importance. The applicability of the models developed in this work is relevant for trucks tyre-noise prediction, represented by the AVON V 4 test tyre, at the early stage of road pavements use. Therefore, the obtained models are highly useful for the design of pavements and for noise prediction by road authorities and contractors.

40|$|Skid {{resistance}} {{is a condition}} parameter that characterizes the contribution that a road surface makes {{to the level of}} friction available at the contact patch between a road surface and vehicle tire during acceleration, breaking and cornering manoeuvres. The surface texture and the surface course properties affect the roughness (microtexture, macrotexture and <b>megatexture)</b> which is influenced by traffic, weather and the environment. Some statistics data indicate that the number of accidents increases by up to two folds during rainy conditions. The PSV value of the aggregates used is a significant but not the sole influencing factor. The Polished Stone Value is determined under standard laboratory conditions and indicates to which extent an aggregate is resistant to polishing under the action of traffic. Skid resistance changes over time. Typically it increases {{in the first two years}} following construction as the roadway is worn away by traffic and rough aggregate surfaces become exposed, and then decreases over the remaining pavement life as aggregates become more polished. In the present study, skid resistance and aggregate polishing value were conducted under varying bitumen content and using fillers materials like cement, fly ash. Texture depth is also a direct measure of area of contacts between tire and HMA surface so it also has the direct effect on pavement surface skidding...|$|E

40|$|Efficient and well-maintained road {{systems are}} {{necessary}} for the economic well being of any industrialized country. Maintenance and rehabilitation of existing roads have taken priority over new construction in recent years, thus making information {{about the condition of}} road surfaces extremely important. Several methods of gathering this information have been developed worldwide; one of them is Laser Road Surface Tester (Laser RST), which was developed in Sweden in 1981. The Laser RST is a laser-based, computer-automated, non-contact road profilometer system with the ability to collect and simultaneously process data about the road surface. Variables measured include rut depth, unevenness, cracking, <b>megatexture,</b> rough macrotexture, fine macrotexture, crossfall, curves, and elapsed distance. Subjective evaluations are also supported, if desired. Eleven laser rangefinders (LRFs), mounted {{on the front of the}} Laser RST van, are the primary components of the data collection system. They scan the road with high-speed, high-resolution distance sampling. The signals from the lasers are sent through signal processing cards (SPCs) and then to a computer inside the van for final processing. Data is stored on floppy disk and printed by an on-board printer. The Laser RST is an extremely complex system but it is also a modular one, making troubleshooting and repair relatively easy, inexpensive, and fast. This paper discusses the various modules available. Variables measured are defined and measurement algorithms detailed.

40|$|The {{surface texture}} of a pavement, {{including}} uneveness, is largely determinant of drivers’safety and comfort. It is undoubtedly {{a major cause}} of road traffic accidents all over the world. Statistics show that one million killed and 50 million injured are reported every year by Competent Authorities. The effect of traffic noise has also become a critical public issue. On the road networking the surface characteristics of pavements also contributed to nearly 80 - 90 % of roadway traffic noise. Not only engines or exhaust systems generate noise. The impact of tire-surface at speeds above 50 km/h also needs to be added to prime offenders. Functional requirements such as roadway safety, environmental quality, driving comfort and operating costs in the road network are assessed by indicators whose limits are continuously adjusted. The roadway texture is again a main intervenient. This paper aims at describing the texture indicators {{that can be used for}} the assessment of the texture of a pavement from a network point of view, based on profiles acquired at high speeds, including <b>megatexture.</b> First an overview of the concepts related to texture and the effects of texture, including unevenness, on safety, driving comfort, ride quality and environmental quality is given. Then, a case study related to a highly trafficked road in the north of Portugal is presented. This study is the second phase of a broader study that started with the analysis of the structural capacity of that road. In this second phase, a high speed profilometer was used to measure the pavement profile with a sampling rate which is considered to be adequate for the analysis of longitudinal profile, macrotexture and unevenness. Indicators such as the mean profile depth, the IRI and the rutting depth and the corresponding effects were addressed...|$|E
40|$|Traffic {{noise is}} one of the main sources of {{acoustic}} pollution, with an ubiquitous presence in anthropised environments. Therefore, it is a constant component of residual noise during every noise measurement. The generation and propagation of traffic noise is governed by three main different mechanisms: vehicles' power unit (i. e. the engine, gearbox and cooling system), vehicles' profile aerodynamics and tyre-road interaction. While engine noise is the main source up to 35 km/h, for higher speeds propulsion noise is negligible over noise due to tyre/road interaction. For heavy vehicles, like lorries, the contribution of propulsion noise cannot be neglected even at higher speeds. Tyre/road interaction depends greatly on the characteristics of road surfaces: a subtle difference in road surfaces may yield a large variation in noise levels. This idea has lead to a series of studies that focused on providing theoretical and phenomenological analysis of the influence of road profile on noise emission. The characterisation of a road surface requires the measurement of its profile: the device used to carry out these measurements is known as profilometer; modern road profilometry is based on laser triangulation sensors, which allow a simple and direct measurement of road texture. The purpose of this work, carried out at the CNR spin-off company iPool srl, was to develop a laser profilometer focused on measuring the macrotexture and <b>megatexture</b> of road pavements, which cover wavelengths of the same order of magnitude as the size of tyre tread elements and of the tyre/road interface and to verify some of the existing models to predict tyre rolling noise based on road texture knowledge. This work confirms the importance of macrotexture (MaTx) and part of <b>megatexture</b> (MeTx) in the generation of rolling noise. The profilometer, mounted on a vehicle, is composed of a laser displacement sensor, an accelerometer, known in jargon as inertial unit and a rotary encoder attached to a wheel, which provides the horizontal travelled distance. This profilometer presents many strong points, viz. a simple usage and relative low cost compared to other laser profilometers; moreover it presents a new procedure to obtain the road profile by combining the information provided by the laser output, a time-domain displacement signal and a record of the distance travelled by the vehicle, measured by the angular encoder. Chapter 1 provides a description of the main terminology and devices used in profiling, while chapter 2 deals the essential theoretical background of the dominant phenomena involved in the generation of rolling noise and describes the main models that correlate rolling noise and road texture. Chapter 3 accurately explains every component the profilometer; it is roughly divided in two main parts, the first one outlines the hardware components specifications and limits, while the second part overviews the signal processing. An algorithm in Matlab environment for data processing was also developed, dealing with the re-mapping of the time-domain vertical displacement signal with a constant sampling frequency to a space-domain profile, sampled every 0. 5 mm, and subsequent evaluation of road texture parameters has been conducted on different sites. A simple mathematical model of road texture enveloped by the tyre has also been used during data analysis, simulating the actual road surface that is in contact with the tyre. The following chapter addresses the possible sources of uncertainty of profiling operations. A theoretical model of the response of the laser sensor at different wavelengths has also been developed, taking into account the finite spot size of the laser and the finite exposure time of the pixel array. These two factors contribute to the identification of the working range of the sensor. Chapter 5 presents a calibration of the device and consequent assessment of reproducibility and repeatability of measurements. Calibration has dealt with every component singularly through specific measurements, such as measurements of the lateral profile of a rotating disc with cogs of different sizes, calibration of the accelerometer with a B&K calibrator and an oscillating bar, and the measurement of the profile of a surface with known characteristics. Repeatability of measurements has been thoroughly verified, via repetitions of measurements of the same road profile; reproducibility has been checked by measuring the same road profile with another profilometer already available on the market, and owned by the Department of Civil Engineering of Università di Pisa. Finally, an evaluation of the correlation between rolling noise and road texture is presented in chapter 6. Measurements of road texture provided by the profilometer are correlated with rolling noise emission on six different kinds of pavements: again, the chapter can be divided in two main sections. The former deals with the calculation of the correlation coefficient between parameters related to road texture, such as third-octave bands texture spectrum and rolling noise measured by CPX method, while the latter deals with the comparison of two existing models and the elaboration of a simple model to obtain the mean CPX broadband level of a road surface based the knowledge of its texture spectrum. The model uses two bands of the octave band texture spectrum, to predict rolling noise: the octave band centred at 5 mm, related to air pumping, is negatively correlated to sound generation, while the band at 80 mm shows a positive correlation, related to tyre vibrations. One of the main innovations of this model, despite the limited number of samples, is the usage of enveloped texture, which distinguishes road surfaces with sharp edges and deep grooves. The correlations found confirm the theoretical knowledge of tyre/road noise, but also underline that a complete description of rolling noise must take into account not only road texture, but also the tyre itself. In fact, a resonance in the CPX noise spectrum at 80 km/h was also successfully identified. The further perfectioning of the profilometer will permit deeper studies of the correlation between properties of road texture and rolling noise, and to develop a comprehensive model of tyre/road interaction noise: possible improvements are the simultaneous usage of two or more displacement sensors that profile adjacent lines, in order to reduce uncertainty in the evaluation of texture spectrum and the substitution of the current sensor with one that has a smaller spot size...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} the current practices and methods adopted by roads agencies {{around the world}} with regard to collection, analysis and utilization of the data elements pertaining to the main pavement condition indicators in pavement management systems (PMS). It also aimed at identifying the main predictors associated with each condition indicator and the factors that govern pavement structural and functional performance. Development of a new performance index that incorporates parameters or measures related to the main condition indicators (surface defects, roughness, deflection and skid resistance) and establishing the weight to be assigned to each indicator based on the relative impact on pavement condition {{was also one of the}} main objectives of this study. Thousands of pavement sections were subjected to thorough testing and inspection over the last few years to collect data pertaining to the main condition indicators. The collected data encompass visual distress survey, deflection measurements, roughness and skid resistance measurements. Collection of various condition indicators was accomplished according to well known international standards. The collected data were processed, tabulated and analyzed for the purpose of development of performance models and to prove certain theories or good practices. Advanced tools and machines were utilized to collect these data with a high degree of accuracy. The Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) was used to collect deflection data for structural analysis. Two Non-contact laser roughness measuring devices mounted on vehicles were heavily used for collecting roughness, texture, and rutting data. Distress data were collected using a manual procedure adopted and standardized at the Pavement Management System Unit of Dubai Emirate. Powerful engineering and statistical softwares were used in the analysis for the purpose of processing the data, back calculating the main parameters pertaining to pavement response, establishing the correlation matrices between various dependent variables and their predictors, and finally, applying linear and non linear regression analysis to develop reliable and predictable deterioration models for the uses of pavement management system. The analysis procedure was supplemented by a vast literature review for the up to date information along within deep investigations and verifications for some of the current practices, theories and models used in pavement design and pavement evaluation with more emphasis on the inherent drawbacks associated to these models and procedures. The study confirmed that pavement condition deterioration and performance can be best predicted and evaluated based on four main condition indicators; First, surface distress to assess the physical condition of the pavements and detect the inherent problems and defects caused by various factors affecting pavement performance. Second; roughness measurements to evaluate the riding quality of the pavement. Third; deflection to calculate pavement response (stress and strains) and to assess pavement structural capacity and calculating the remaining life, and finally, skid resistance measurement to assess the level of safety and surface texture properties. Thorough study and investigation of the physical condition indicators and the associated parameters, confirmed that pavement distress data are vital elements in each pavement management system. Distress data can be used effectively to identify the main problems associated with pavement performance, causes of deterioration, maintenance measures needed to prevent the acceleration of the distress, the rehabilitation schemes needed to improve the pavement condition and finally to prepare maintenance work programs and to estimate the annual maintenance needs under an open or limited budget. Alligator cracking was found to have the heaviest impact on pavement condition. Distress density, probable causes of deterioration and distress propagation rate are the required parameters in PMS. Roughness was found to have a basic influence on pavement condition and the type of selected treatment. The use of Roughness data in terms of International Roughness Index (IRI) can be optimized in PMS by using this indicator in the following forms:Roughness, as an objective measure, can be used as a good performance predictor of the current riding quality of pavements in service and reflects the inherent imperfections and built-in irregularities embodied in the road pavement surface. Roughness measurement can be used as a reference to establish construction specifications and provides through the PMS system an organized feedback approach to correct the persistent design deficiencies detected after road construction. Roughness can be used effectively in the planning process for maintenance works and to select the candidate sections through calculating the functional remaining life based on the estimated terminal value using Roughness-Age, Roughness-ESAL, and Roughness-PSI models. Lane–IRI along with the Difference between the left and right wheel IRI values, termed as “ Yaw” are the most suitable forms to be used in PMS to report about roughness characteristics. Yaw term can be used effectively to report or feed back about geometric imperfections that exist on the road surface such as improper cross slope, shoving and the probable drainage problems. The roughness cumulative distribution curves can be used as a planning tool in PMS to report at the network level. These curves indicate the network health and the required funding at different level of risks, so proactive measures can be taken and the required budgets can be made available. Deflection data were found to form a basic component of the PMS. It was found that these data can be used at both network and project levels. Direct deflection measurements were found Not to be the ideal form to report about structural capacity at the network level. It is rather can be used at project level to detect weak spots and critical pavements layers. At the network level, the back calculated parameters from deflection basin such as Pavement Modulus (Ep), Asphalt and Pavement Curvature (CUR), Cross Sectional Area and the other deflection basin characteristics are much more appropriate for reporting about pavement structural conditions and calculating the structural remaining life in PMS. The design deflection and curvature that characterize the pavement have been found to be calculated based on the mean along with the two times the standard deviation of the measured data. The Effective Structural Number (SNeff) was found to have good correlations with the Total Pavement Thickness (Ht), the value of the deflection measured at the center of the loading plate (D 0) and the difference between D 0 and the deflection measured at 450 mm from the center of the loading plate (D 0 - D 450). The first two variables were found to account for more than 92 % of the structural capacity prediction model. Traffic variable in terms of the accumulated standard repetitions (ESAL) was found to account for more than 60 % of the deflection model predictability. Other variables such as E value, asphalt and base layer thicknesses can improve the predictability of the model if included. The concept of the relative value of effective pavement modulus to the original pavement modulus (Eeff/E 0) was found to gives a reliable representation about the exhausted and the remaining life of the in-service pavement structure. The study showed that the pavement is reported to be structurally failed, when the effective asphalt or pavement modulus is about 20 - 35 % of its original design value which is equal to the modulus of the unbound material. It was also found that when the area of the fatigue cracking and the patching distresses exceeds 17 % of the total pavement section area, or the depth of rutting is more than 15 mm, the pavement is reported to be structurally failed and major rehabilitation or reconstruction should be applied. Skid resistance can be reported in the form of International Friction Index (IFI), as a well defined universal index, along with other two numbers; F 60 Friction (Microtexture) related number measured at 60 km/h velocity and Macrotexture related number and Vp, which constitute the IFI index can be used in Pavement management system applications to report about skid resistance characteristics and the network level of safety. These three figures can be used to report about pavement condition, accidents, airports operations, and maintenance management surveys. In this study, new methods and models were developed and suggested to be used in PMS as an alternative to the current available methods which were found to be impractical in certain cases. Finally, further research efforts are recommended to explore the uses of other parameters in particular those related to deflection basin analysis, cross sectional area, curvature, and pavement moduli. Skid resistance testing and reporting method should be subjected to further research works for the purpose of standardizing reporting methods, identifying the relative impact of main predictors i. e. <b>megatexture,</b> macrotexture and microtexture components and to develop performance models...|$|E
