40|$|Background Fibromyalgia (FM) is a {{syndrome}} primarily characterised by chronic, widespread musculo-skeletal pain. In the aetiology of this syndrome {{a crucial}} role is played by complex interac-tions among biological, genetic, psychological, and socio-cultural factors. Recently, researchers have started to explore emotional functioning in FM, with their attention focused on alexithymia, a personality construct that affects the regulation of a person’s own emo-tions. On the other hand, the detection and experience of emotional signals from other peo-ple have only been sparsely investigated in FM syndrome and no studies have investigated the ability to represent other people’s mental states (i. e. Theory of Mind, ToM) in these pa-tients. Here we present the first study investigating a large set of social-cognitive abilities, and the possible relationships between these abilities and the performance on executive-function tasks, in a homogenous sample of patients with FM.

40|$|AIM: Inspection time (IT) is a {{processing}} speed measure, recently investigated as a biomarker of ageing. This study examined whether earlier IT predicts subsequent problems in everyday functioning in community-dwelling elderly people. METHODS: Participants completed IT at baseline, 6 months and 18 months. At 42 months, {{two groups of}} 15 elderly people <b>matched</b> for <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>age</b> (74 - 88 years) and selected for slower or faster baseline IT, completed a fourth estimate of IT and a practical assessment of everyday functioning (Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living - Adelaide). RESULTS: At 42 months, the group with slower baseline IT had significantly poorer performance (slower completion, higher errors) on {{more than half of}} the everyday functioning tasks. CONCLUSION: Slower IT predicts difficulties up to 4 years later in everyday functioning of elderly adults, providing discriminant validation for IT as a biomarker for future changes.

40|$|Vascular {{cognitive}} impairment (VCI) {{is characterized by}} cognitive compromise predominantly of executive dysfunction. OBJECTIVES: To assess cognitive functions in VCI, focusing on executive functions, to observe functional losses in relation to {{activities of daily living}} (ADLs) and to detect early symptoms prior to the onset of dementia. METHODS: We evaluated healthy subjects <b>matched</b> for gender, <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>age</b> to patients with diagnosis of subcortical vascular disease who had a stroke classified into three groups: 1) vascular lesions and no impairment; 2) vascular {{cognitive impairment}} with no dementia (VCIND); 3) vascular dementia (VaD). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The performance on neuropsychological tests differed among groups, worsening with increased impairment level. The probable VaD group demonstrated impaired performance in memory, processing speed and verbal production, while the VCIND group showed attention deficits. CONCLUSION: Impairment in executive functions and difficulties in ADLs allow us to differentiate levels of impairment in groups of subcortical vascular disease...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease {{dementia}} is {{a challenge}} in clinical settings. A comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation is time-consuming and expensive; brief instruments for cognitive evaluation must be easier to administer and provide a reliable classification. Objective: To study {{the validity of the}} Brazilian version of Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R) for the cognitive assessment of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with heterogeneous educational level. Methods: Patients were evaluated according to the diagnostic procedures recommended by the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) as the gold standard for the diagnosis of dementia in PD. Results: We studied 70 idiopathic PD patients, with a mean (SD) age of 64. 1 (9. 3) years and mean disease duration of 7. 7 (5. 3) years and educational level of 5. 9 years, <b>matched</b> for <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>age</b> to controls. Twenty-seven patients fulfilled MDS clinical criteria for PD dementia. Mean scores on the ACE-R were 54. 7 (12. 8) points for patients with PD dementia, 76 (9. 9) for PD patients without dementia and 79. 7 (1. 8) points for healthy controls. The area under the receiver operating curve, taking the MDS diagnostic procedures as a reference, was 0. 93 [95 % CI, 0. 87 - 0. 98; p< 0. 001] for ACE-R. The optimal cut-off value for ACE-R was &# 8804; 72 points [sensitivity 90 %; specificity 85 %; Kappa concordance (K) 0. 79]. Conclusion: ACE-R appears to be a valid tool for dementia evaluation in PD patients with heterogeneous educational level, displaying good correlation with clinical criteria and diagnostic procedures of the MDS...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a {{syndrome}} primarily characterised by chronic, widespread musculoskeletal pain. In the aetiology of this syndrome {{a crucial}} role is played by complex interactions among biological, genetic, psychological, and socio-cultural factors. Recently, researchers have started to explore emotional functioning in FM, with their attention focused on alexithymia, a personality construct that affects the regulation of a person's own emotions. On the other hand, the detection and experience of emotional signals from other people have only been sparsely investigated in FM syndrome and no studies have investigated the ability to represent other people's mental states (i. e. Theory of Mind, ToM) in these patients. Here we present the first study investigating a large set of social-cognitive abilities, and the possible relationships between these abilities and the performance on executive-function tasks, in a homogenous sample of patients with FM. METHODOLOGY: Forty women with FM and forty-one healthy women <b>matched</b> for <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>age</b> {{were involved in the}} study. Social cognition was assessed with a set of validated experimental tasks. Measures of executive function were used to test the correlations between this dimension and the social-cognitive profile of patients with FM. Relationships between social-cognitive abilities and demographic, clinical and psychological variables were also investigated. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Patients with FM have impairments both in the regulation of their own affect and in the recognition of other's emotions, as well as in representing other people's mental states. No significant correlations were found between social cognition tasks and the subcomponents of the executive function that were analysed. CONCLUSIONS: The results show the presence of several impairments in social cognition skills in patients with FM, which are largely independent of both executive function deficits and symptoms of psychological distress. The impairments reported highlight the importance of adequately assessing ToM and emotional functioning in clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Exposure to {{indoor air}} of private or public {{buildings}} contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) has raised health concerns in long-term users. This exploratory neuropsychological group {{study investigated the}} potential adverse effects of chronic low-dose exposure to specific air-borne low chlorinated PCBs on well-being and behavioral measures in adult humans. Methods Thirty employees exposed to indoor air contaminated with PCBs from elastic sealants in a school building were compared to 30 non-exposed controls <b>matched</b> for <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>age,</b> controlling for gender (age range 37 – 61 years). PCB exposure was verified by external exposure data and biological monitoring (PCB 28, 101, 138, 153, 180). Subjective complaints, learning and memory, executive function, and visual-spatial function was assessed by standardized neuropsychological testing. Since exposure status depended {{on the use of}} contaminated rooms, an objectively exposed subgroup (N = 16; PCB 28 = 0. 20 μg/l; weighted exposure duration 17. 9 ± 7 years) was identified and compared with 16 paired controls. Results Blood analyses indicated a moderate exposure effect size (d) relative to expected background exposure for total PCB (4. 45 ± 2. 44 μg/l; d = 0. 4). A significant exposure effect was found for the low chlorinated PCBs 28 (0. 28 ± 0. 25 μg/l; d = 1. 5) and 101 (0. 07 ± 0. 09 μg/l; d = 0. 7). Although no neuropsychological effects exceeded the adjusted significance level, estimation statistics showed elevated effect sizes for several variables. The objectively exposed subgroup showed a trend towards increased subjective attentional and emotional complaints (tiredness and slowing of practical activities, emotional state) as well as attenuated attentional performance (response shifting and alertness in a cued reaction task). Conclusion Chronic inhalation of low chlorinated PCBs that involved elevated blood levels was associated with a subtle attenuation of emotional well-being and attentional function. Extended research is needed to replicate the potential long-term low PCB effects in a larger sample. </p...|$|R
40|$|The frontal {{assessment}} battery (FAB) is a bedside cognitive scale {{designed to}} measure executive functions. Huntington`s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor, behavioral, and cognitive dysfunction. The {{aim of this study}} was to check the validity of the FAB for the evaluation of cognitive impairment in patients with HD. Forty-one patients diagnosed with HD and 53 healthy controls <b>matched</b> by <b>education,</b> sex <b>and</b> <b>age</b> were evaluated with a validated Brazilian version of the UHDRS, the VFT, the SDMT, the SIT, the MMSE, and the FAB. The diagnosis of HD was made by DNA analysis. FAB scores were lower in patients than in the controls (p < 0. 001) and had significant correlations with the VFT (r = 0. 79; p < 0. 05), the SDMT (r = 0. 80; p < 0. 05), the SIT (r = 0. 72; p < 0. 05), the MMSE (r = 0. 83; p < 0. 05), the FCS (r = 0. 79; p < 0. 05) and the motor section of the UHDRS (r = - 0. 80; p < 0. 05). The FAB differentiated between HD patients in the initial and later stages of the disease. The one-year longitudinal evaluation revealed a global trend toward a worsening in the second score of the FAB. The results demonstrate that the FAB presents good internal consistency and also convergent and discriminative validity; therefore it is a useful scale to assess executive functions and to evaluate cognitive impairment in patients with HD...|$|R
40|$|Background It is {{proposed}} {{that changes in}} reward processing in the brain {{are involved in the}} pathophysiology of pain based on experimental studies. The first aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate if reward drive and/or reward responsiveness was altered in patients with chronic pain (PCP) compared to controls <b>matched</b> for <b>education,</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> sex. The second aim was to investigate the relationship between reward processing and nucleus accumbens volume in PCP and controls. Nucleus accumbens is central in reward processing and its structure has been shown to be affected by chronic pain conditions in previous studies. Methods Reward drive and responsiveness were assessed with the Behavioral Inhibition Scale/Behavioral Activation Scale, and nucleus accumbens volumes obtained from T 1 -weighted brain MRIs obtained at 3 T in 19 PCP of heterogeneous aetiologies and 20 age-, sex- and education-matched healthy controls. Anhedonia was assessed with Beck's Depression Inventory II. Results The PCP group had significantly reduced scores on the reward responsiveness, but not reward drive. There was a trend towards smaller nucleus accumbens volume in the PCP compared to control group. There was a significant positive partial correlation between reward responsiveness and nucleus accumbens volume in the PCP group adjusted for anhedonia, which was significantly different from the same relationship in the control group. Conclusions Reward responsiveness is reduced in chronic pain patients of heterogeneous aetiology, and this reduction was associated with nucleus accumbens volume. Reduced reward responsiveness could be a marker of chronic pain vulnerability, and may indicate reduced opioid function...|$|R
40|$|Fluency tasks {{have been}} widely used to tap the {{voluntary}} generation of responses. The anatomical correlates of fluency tasks and their sensitivity and specificity have been hotly debated. However, investigation of the cognitive processes involved in voluntary generation of responses and whether generation is supported by a common, general process (e. g. fluid intelligence) or specific cognitive processes underpinned by particular frontal regions has rarely been addressed. This study investigates a range of verbal and non-verbal fluency tasks in patients with unselected focal frontal (n = 47) and posterior (n = 20) lesions. Patients and controls (n = 35) <b>matched</b> for <b>education,</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> sex were administered fluency tasks including word (phonemic/semantic), design, gesture and ideational fluency as well as background cognitive tests. Lesions were analysed by standard anterior/ posterior and left/right frontal subdivisions as well as a finer-grained frontal localization method. Thus, patients with right and left lateral lesions were compared to patients with superior medial lesions. The results show that all eight fluency tasks are sensitive to frontal lobe damage although only the phonemic word and design fluency tasks were specific to the frontal region. Superior medial patients were the only group to be impaired on all eight fluency tasks, relative to controls, consistent with an energization deficit. The most marked fluency deficits for lateral patients were along material specific lines (i. e. left - phonemic and right - design). Phonemic word fluency that requires greater selection was most severely impaired following left inferior frontal damage. Overall, our results support the notion that frontal functions comprise a set of specialized cognitive processes, supported by distinct frontal regions...|$|R

40|$|Background: Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) {{has been}} used widely for {{screening}} of cognitive disorders. It has been validated and adapted in various languages. Corrections have been proposed {{to rule out the}} bias in the scoring of MMSE based on <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>age.</b> However association of MMSE scores with socioeconomic status (SES) has not been studied. Aim: This study was aimed at evaluating the association of SES and MMSE. Materials and Methods: SES and the MMSE scores of participants more than 55 years of age were determined by trained social workers and clinical psychologists. The SES was determined by SES scale. <b>Education</b> <b>and</b> <b>age</b> bias was corrected using specific cut-off criteria for <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>age</b> bias while applying MMSE. The data thus obtained was analyzed using Epi-Info software to find the differences in MMSE positive (cognitive impairment present for the educational status <b>and</b> <b>age)</b> <b>and</b> MMSE negative (cognitive impairment absent for the educational status <b>and</b> <b>age)</b> individuals across different SES. Results: The study included 2, 283 participants of whom 652 (28. 6 %), 1326 (58. 1 %) and 305 (13. 4 %) belonged to lower socio economic status (LSES), middle socio economic status (MSES) and upper socio economic status (USES) respectively. The MMSE scores were also compared across the SES. Persons from MSES had higher cognitive impairment when compared with LSES and USES, respectively. Significant difference was found among the two genders on the MMSE scores (more females had cognitive impairment) in only the LSES and not in USES and MSES. Conclusion: The findings suggest putative relationship between cognitive functioning and SESsocioeconomic status amongst the elderly...|$|R
