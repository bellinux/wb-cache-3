Conventional WWW browsers such as Mosaic and Netscape have facilities to browse a document written not only in English but also in other languages, e. g., Japanese, Korean, Chinese and French. However, those browsers are not useful for a document which is written {{in more than one}} language, e. g., Rosetta stone. In addition, it is not feasible for users to make all fonts required to browse foreign documents available in their machines. This paper describes a light-weight browser for multilingual documents in the WWW environment. The browser displays HTML text written in a foreign language but requires no preloaded fonts for that language. This paper presents a document description scheme for multilingual documents called MHTML. It also shows a prototype MHTML browser and its performance.

The first language for SALSA is naturally English, as above 96 % of the web content is in English. As we are developing SALSA in Hong Kong, it is rather normal that the next languages recognizable by SALSA are Cantonese and Mandarin. So SALSA is trilingual from the beginning. In an effort to further internationalize SALSA, it is updated with European languages. The chosen languages are French, Spanish and German as these are the main European languages on the Web. SALSA uses a single recognizer with a common acoustic model for all languages so that a user can browse web pages, in different languages as well as in mixed languages, back and forth seamlessly. In this paper, we discuss issues pertinent to the multilingual SALSA with Asian and European l [...] ...|$|R
