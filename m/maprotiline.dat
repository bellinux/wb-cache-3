25|$|Tianeptine shows {{efficacy}} against serious depressive episodes (major depression), {{comparable to}} amitriptyline, imipramine and fluoxetine, but with significantly fewer side effects. It {{was shown to}} be more effective than <b>maprotiline</b> in a group of people with co-existing depression and anxiety. Tianeptine also displays significant anxiolytic properties and is useful in treating a spectrum of anxiety disorders including panic disorder, as evidenced by a study in which those administered 35% CO2 gas (carbogen) on paroxetine or tianeptine therapy showed equivalent panic-blocking effects. Like many antidepressants (including bupropion, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, moclobemide and numerous others) it may also have a beneficial effect on cognition in people with depression-induced cognitive dysfunction.|$|E

50|$|<b>Maprotiline,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Ludiomil among others, is a tetracyclic {{antidepressant}} (TeCA) that {{is used in the}} treatment of depression. It may alternatively be classified as a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), specifically a secondary amine. In terms of its chemistry and pharmacology, <b>maprotiline</b> is closely related to other secondary amine TCAs like nortriptyline and protriptyline, and has similar effects to them.|$|E

50|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{profile of}} <b>maprotiline</b> explains its antidepressant, sedative, anxiolytic, and sympathomimetic activities. In accordance to the pharmacological characteristics {{it is used}} in the treatment of depression, such as depression associated with agitation or anxiety. Additionally, it shows strong antagonism against reserpine-induced effects in animal studies, as do the other 'classical' antidepressants. Although <b>maprotiline</b> behaves in most regards as a 'first-generation antidepressant' it is commonly referred to as 'second-generation antidepressant'.|$|E
50|$|The {{postulated}} {{mechanism of}} <b>maprotiline</b> {{is that it}} acts primarily by potentiation of central adrenergic synapses by blocking reuptake of norepinephrine at nerve endings. This pharmacological action {{is thought to be}} primarily responsible for the drug's antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. It is a strong norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with only weak effects on serotonin and dopamine reuptake. At higher doses however, <b>maprotiline</b> increases serotonergic transmission and increases the level of serotonin available.|$|E
5000|$|Antidepressants with a tetracyclic {{structure}} such as mianserin and <b>maprotiline</b> {{were first}} {{developed in the}} 1970s as tetracyclic antidepressants.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Maprotiline</b> can {{increase}} the actions of oral antidiabetic drugs (sulfonylureas) and Insulin. Diabetic patients should have regular assessments of their blood-glucose-levels.|$|E
50|$|Withdrawal {{symptoms}} frequently {{seen when}} treatment with <b>maprotiline</b> is stopped abruptly (agitation, anxiety, insomnia, sometimes activation of mania or rebound depression) are not indicative of addiction {{and can be}} avoided by reducing the daily dose of <b>maprotiline</b> gradually by approximately 25% each week. If treatment has to be stopped at once due to medical reasons, {{the use of a}} benzodiazepine (e.g. lorazepam, clonazepam, or alprazolam) for a maximum of 4 weeks as needed will usually suppress withdrawal symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Maprotiline</b> may {{amplify the}} actions of coumarin-type anticogulants (e.g. warfarin, phenprocoumon). The plasma-prothrombin-activity must be {{assessed}} closely {{in order to avoid}} overt bleedings.|$|E
50|$|<b>Maprotiline</b> {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of depression, such as depression associated with agitation or anxiety and has similar efficacy to the antidepressant drug moclobemide.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Maprotiline</b> has a {{wide range}} of {{possible}} interactions. Some are typical for TCAs and TeCAs, others are caused by specific metabolic effects (e.g. high plasma-protein-binding) of maprotiline: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Maprotiline</b> {{exhibits}} strong {{effects as}} a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with only weak actions the reuptake of serotonin and dopamine. It {{is also a}} strong antagonist of the H1 receptor, a moderate antagonist of the 5-HT2 and α1-adrenergic receptors, and a weak antagonist of the D2 and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. <b>Maprotiline</b> has also more recently {{been identified as a}} potent antagonist of the 5-HT7 receptor, with this action potentially playing an important role in its antidepressant effectiveness. The drug is a strong antihistamine, but unlike most TCAs, has minimal anticholinergic effects.|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>maprotiline</b> in the {{treatment}} of enuresis in pediatric patients has so far not been systematically explored and its use is not recommended. Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population in general have not been established. Anyone considering the use of <b>maprotiline</b> in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need. In general, lower dosages are recommended for patients over 60 years of age. Dosages of 50 mg to 75 mg daily are usually satisfactory as maintenance therapy for elderly patients who do not tolerate higher amounts.|$|E
50|$|<b>Maprotiline</b> is a tetracyclic {{compound}} and is grouped with the TeCAs. Its chemical name is N-methyl-9,10-ethanoanthracen-9(10H)-propylamine. The drug has a dibenzobicyclo2.2.2octadiene (9,10-dihydro-9,10-ethanoanthracene) ring system; that is, a tricyclic anthracene ring system with an ethylene {{bridge across the}} central ring. This results in it having a unique three-dimensional central ring (a bicyclo2.2.2octane or 1,4-endoethylenecyclohexane ring) and being a tetracyclic rather than a tricyclic compound. However, it could also or alternatively {{be considered to be}} a tricyclic and hence a TCA. In addition to its heterocyclic ring system, <b>maprotiline</b> has an alkylamine side chain attached similarly to other TCAs (but notably unlike other TeCAs). In terms of the side chain, it is a secondary amine, and its chemical structure, aside from the ethylene link in the central ring, {{is similar to that of}} secondary amine TCAs like nortriptyline and protriptyline. In accordance, the pharmacology of <b>maprotiline</b> is very similar to that of secondary amine TCAs.|$|E
50|$|Same {{as other}} antidepressants, <b>maprotiline</b> {{increased}} the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, {{adolescents and young}} adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of <b>maprotiline</b> or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. <b>Maprotiline</b> is not approved for use in pediatric patients.|$|E
50|$|<b>Maprotiline</b> is marketed {{throughout}} the world mainly under the brand name Ludiomil. It is also available {{under a variety of}} other brand names including Deprilept, Maprolu, and Psymion among others.|$|E
50|$|Oxaprotiline (developmental {{code name}} C 49-802 BDA), {{also known as}} hydroxymaprotiline, is a {{norepinephrine}} reuptake inhibitor of the tetracyclic antidepressant (TeCA) family that is related to <b>maprotiline.</b> Though investigated as an antidepressant, it was never marketed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Maprotiline</b> may worsen {{psychotic}} {{conditions like}} schizophrenia {{and should be}} given with caution. The antipsychotic treatment should be continued. Patients with bipolar affective disorder should not receive antidepressants whilst in a manic phase, as antidepressants can worsen mania.|$|E
5000|$|Benzoctamine (Tacitin) - a tetracyclic {{compound}} and {{is closely related}} to <b>maprotiline,</b> with the two compounds differing only in the length of their side chain, but benzoctamine is not used as an antidepressant and is instead used as an anxiolytic ...|$|E
50|$|Chemically, {{benzoctamine}} {{belongs to}} the class of compounds called dibenzobicyclo-octodienes. It is a tetracyclic compound, consisting of four rings in a three dimensional configuration, and is very closely related structurally to the tetracyclic antidepressant (TeCA) <b>maprotiline,</b> differing only in the length of their side chain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Maprotiline</b> is {{very similar}} in {{structure}} to the anxiolytic, sedative, and muscle relaxant drug benzoctamine (Tacitin). The only structural {{difference between the two}} compounds is in the length of their side chain. However, this modification results in considerable differences in their pharmacological and therapeutic effects.|$|E
5000|$|Drugs, which induce certain enzymes in the liver, e.g. barbiturates, phenytoin, {{carbamazepine}} {{and oral}} anticonceptive drugs, enhance {{the elimination of}} <b>maprotiline</b> and decrease its antidepressant effects. Additionally the blood-concentrations of phenytoin or carbamazepine may be increased, leading to a higher incidents of side effects.|$|E
50|$|Dextroprotiline acts as {{a potent}} {{norepinephrine}} reuptake inhibitor and H1 receptor antagonist, {{as well as a}} very weak α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist. It has negligible affinity for the serotonin transporter, dopamine transporter, α2-adrenergic receptor, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Whether it has any antagonistic effects on the 5-HT2, 5-HT7, or D2 receptors like its relative <b>maprotiline</b> is unclear.|$|E
