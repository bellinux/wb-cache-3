5|$|Examples of {{matching}} include the Head Start program, which requires that recipients provide 20% {{of the total}} annual expenses in either monetary or in-kind contributions. Recipients of these funds <b>may</b> <b>contribute</b> money to cover teacher payroll, or <b>may</b> <b>contribute</b> a building to house the program classrooms. However, the federal government requires that in-kind contributions be properly valued and evidenced (such as estimating {{the value of a}} building {{to make sure that it}} meets the 20% of the program budget), and certain programs specifically require that matching be made by contributing money only.|$|E
5|$|Naked {{extracellular}} DNA (eDNA), {{most of it}} {{released by}} cell death, is nearly ubiquitous in the environment. Its concentration in soil may {{be as high as}} 2 μg/L, and its concentration in natural aquatic environments may be as high at 88 μg/L. Various possible functions have been proposed for eDNA: it may be involved in horizontal gene transfer; it may provide nutrients; and it may act as a buffer to recruit or titrate ions or antibiotics. Extracellular DNA acts as a functional extracellular matrix component in the biofilms of several bacterial species. It may act as a recognition factor to regulate the attachment and dispersal of specific cell types in the biofilm; it <b>may</b> <b>contribute</b> to biofilm formation; and it <b>may</b> <b>contribute</b> to the biofilm's physical strength and resistance to biological stress.|$|E
5|$|The role of LTP in {{disease is}} less clear than its role in basic {{mechanisms}} of synaptic plasticity.

Impaired LTP may also have a role in Alzheimer's disease and drug addiction.|$|E

5|$|Although {{dopamine}} {{is normally}} {{broken down by}} an oxidoreductase enzyme, it is also susceptible to oxidation by direct reaction with oxygen, yielding quinones plus various free radicals as products. The rate of oxidation can be increased {{by the presence of}} ferric iron or other factors. Quinones and free radicals produced by autoxidation of dopamine can poison cells, and there is evidence that this mechanism <b>may</b> <b>contribute</b> to the cell loss that occurs in Parkinson's disease and other conditions.|$|E
5|$|Decreased {{levels of}} retinoic acid {{in the skin}} <b>may</b> <b>contribute</b> to comedo formation. To address this deficiency, methods to {{increase}} the skin's production of retinoid acid are being explored. A vaccine against inflammatory acne has shown promising results in mice and humans. Some have voiced concerns about creating a vaccine designed to neutralize a stable community of normal skin bacteria that is known to protect the skin from colonization by more harmful microorganisms.|$|E

2500|$|<b>May</b> <b>contributed</b> {{to former}} Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett's album Feedback 86, playing guitar {{on the track}} [...] "Cassandra" [...] and {{providing}} guitar and vocals for [...] "Slot Machine," [...] which was co-written by May. Although produced in 1986, the album was not issued as a commercial release until 2000. May worked with his second wife Anita Dobson on her first album, in which she sang vocals to the EastEnders theme tune. In this form, the tune became the song [...] "Anyone Can Fall in Love". May produced the song, which reached No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart in August 1986. In 1989, <b>May</b> <b>contributed</b> guitar solos to the song [...] "When Death Calls" [...] on Black Sabbath's 14th album Headless Cross, and the Living in a Box track [...] "Blow The House Down" [...] from the album Gatecrashing.|$|R
5|$|MFGM {{phospholipid}} components such as phosphatidylcholine {{are a key}} constituent of {{the intestinal}} mucus barrier, and therefore <b>may</b> <b>contribute</b> to intestinal defense against invasive pathogens. Sphingolipids, including sphingomyelin, {{are present in the}} apical membrane of the gut epithelia, and are also important for maintaining membrane structure, modulating growth factor receptors, and serving competitive binding inhibitors for microorganisms, microbial toxins, and viruses. Gangliosides are also present in intestinal mucosa and may possibly contribute to improved gut microflora and antibacterial defense.|$|E
5|$|Other {{blood tests}} are often taken to help {{understand}} a person's general health and risk factors that <b>may</b> <b>contribute</b> to heart disease.

Fasting lipids and fasting blood glucose (or an HbA1c level) are often ordered to evaluate a person's cholesterol and diabetes status, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Scales {{may have}} evolved {{initially}} for providing insulation. Scales on the thorax {{and other parts}} of the body <b>may</b> <b>contribute</b> to maintaining the high body temperatures required during flight. The 'solid' scales of basal moths are however not as efficient as those of their more advanced relatives as the presence of a lumen adds air layers and increases the insulation value. Scales also help increase the lift to drag ratio in gliding flight.|$|E
5|$|The 2s {{electrons}} of beryllium <b>may</b> <b>contribute</b> {{to chemical}} bonding. Therefore, when 7Be decays by L-electron capture, {{it does so}} by taking electrons from its atomic orbitals that may be participating in bonding.

However, the link between genetics and self-harm in otherwise healthy patients is largely inconclusive.|$|E

5|$|Underwire bras, {{like other}} constrictive garments, <b>may</b> <b>contribute</b> to clogged milk ducts in {{lactating}} women. Fluctuating breast size during pregnancy poses another problem. Because underwire bras are rigid, {{they do not}} easily accommodate changes in breast size, and an ill-fitting bra that {{does not support the}} breasts correctly can cause discomfort and pain. For several days after a mastectomy, or as long as the breast is tender, a woman is advised not to use an underwire bra.|$|E
5|$|Whisky {{is one of}} Scotland's more known {{goods of}} {{economic}} activity. Exports increased by 87% in the decade to 2012 and were valued at £4.3 billion in 2013, which was 85% of Scotland's food and drink exports. It supports around 10,000 jobs directly and 25,000 indirectly. It <b>may</b> <b>contribute</b> £400–682 million to Scotland, rather than several billion pounds, as more than 80% of whisky produced is owned by non-Scottish companies.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{food items}} {{commonly}} consumed by humans are toxic to hamsters {{and should be}} avoided completely in captivity. After they are completely weaned at around 21 days of age, Campbell's dwarf hamsters are lactose intolerant and cannot digest milk. Onions and garlic are very dangerous and can cause severe haemolytic anemia. Leafy green vegetables such as cabbage and celery contain {{a large amount of}} water, so can have severe laxative effects on small animals. Grapes and raisins <b>may</b> <b>contribute</b> to acute renal failure, due to their high level of acidity. Chocolate and other sticky foods such peanut butter may solidify in a hamster's cheek pouches and lead to infections, which can lead to death.|$|E
