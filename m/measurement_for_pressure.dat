The primary interest {{of this study is to}} set up a reliable hydrodynamics model of a supersonic ejector, which may be extended to refrigeration applications. The validation deals particularly with ejectors of zero induced flow. It concentrates on the prediction of shock location, shock strength and the average pressure recovery. In this respect, axial pressure measurements with a capillary probe and performed previously [18, 19], have been used in this work for validation and comparison purposes with numerical simulation. A crucial point is that the probe has been included in the numerical model. In these conditions, the RNG and k-omega-sst models have been found to perform satisfactorily for these parameters. For ejectors with an induced flow, preliminary tests have also been performed. Laser tomography pictures were used to evaluate the non-mixing length.
