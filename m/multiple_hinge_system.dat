40|$|Abstract: As the key {{components}} of large-scale hydraulic radial gate, <b>hinge</b> <b>system</b> {{play an important role}} in supporting the gate and sustaining loads. They must satisfy the requirements of intensity, rigidity and supporting stability. Due to the complicated working conditions of the gate, it is difficult to calculate stress and strain of the <b>hinge</b> <b>system</b> based on traditional design method. In this paper, taking the radial gate in Silin hydropower station as an example, finite element technology is introduced into the analysis of the <b>hinge</b> <b>system.</b> The approach of this work includes steps of (1) obtaining the maximum load of the <b>hinge</b> <b>system</b> by analyzing and comparing different working conditions of the gate, (2) modeling the <b>hinge</b> <b>system</b> by meshing, loading and boundary constraints, and (3) computing stress and strain of its major components under the most dangerous condition. The results verify design feasibility and structural reliability of the <b>hinge</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

The <b>hinged</b> <b>system</b> consists of a central hub with masses attached to (assumed) massless booms of fixed length whose orientation relative to the main part can change. The general three dimensional deployment dynamics of such a <b>hinged</b> <b>system</b> is considered without any restriction on {{the location of the}} hinge points. The equations of motion for the <b>hinged</b> <b>system,</b> with viscous damping at both hinge points, are linearized about the nominal equilibrium position where the booms are orthogonal to the nominal spin axis for the case of two dimensional and three dimensional motion. Analytic stability criteria are obtained from the necessary condition on the sign of all the coefficients in the system characteristic equation...|$|R

30|$|When {{using the}} IRF and its <b>hinge</b> <b>system,</b> it may {{sometimes}} become difficult or even impossible {{to place the}} hinges in the desired position, due to the frame construct itself. Even though the construct of the Ilizarov device theoretically may allow for axial corrections in every possible dimension, treatment of multidimensional deformities may practically only partially be possible and mostly affords a step-by-step treatment of all deformities. This may lengthen the procedure, and is prone to lead to further deformities.|$|R

The procedures used for test and evaluation of the booms are described, and problems encountered and results achieved are considered. Analytical methods, using a digital computer program, and functional test operation with the best possible environmental simulation, were both applied to the problem and comparisons between analytical and test results were made to evaluate their validity and to reveal the effects of errors and imperfections. There is a synergistic advantage in the combined approach in that mutual comparison gives better evaluation of both analysis and test results than independent study of either.

50|$|The best stamp hinges {{are also}} {{designed}} to be “peelable”, meaning that the stamp may be removed from the page, and the hinge from the stamp, without any damage to either. Not all makes of hinge have this property, and the backs of many stamps have “hinge remnants”, where the hinge has torn away rather than releasing the stamp. This is especially common for mint stamps, where the stamp’s own gum adheres tightly to the hinge. Some old stamps may actually have <b>multiple</b> <b>hinge</b> remnants layered on top of each other. Conversely, careless removal of a hinge may take away a layer of the stamp’s paper, resulting in a type of stamp thin known as a hinge thin. The thinner paper will be noticeable when the stamp is held up to the light and is considered a serious fault in a stamp.|$|R

We examine the analytic properties when A is a matrix ring or a group ring, and show that the models with matrix ring have a novel strong-weak duality which interchanges the roles of triangles and hinges.

2500|$|Another weight-saving concept the {{designers}} {{came up with}} was detachable wingtips. The wings were designed to fold at a point about [...] out along the span, reducing the space taken up on the carrier. Normally the <b>hinge</b> <b>system</b> {{would have to be}} built very strong in order to transmit loads from the outer portions of the wing to the main spar in the inner section, which adds considerable weight. Instead of building the entire wing to be able to withstand high-g loads, only the inner portion of the wing was able to do this. The outer portions were more lightly constructed, and designed to snap off at the hinge line if the g-force exceeded 7.5g. In this case the aircraft would still be flyable and could be repaired after returning to the carrier. This saved [...] of weight.|$|R

30|$|In particular, multidimensional {{deformity}} corrections {{performed with}} the IRF deserve an experienced Ilizarov surgeon, but even then complex deformities may limit the exact use of the IRF and its <b>hinge</b> <b>system.</b> The surgeons who performed the corrections {{in this study are}} all well trained in both the Ilizarov and the TSF procedure, although the devices were not implanted in the same period of time. Whilst the IRF was used mainly from 1985 to 1998, the TSF was used from the beginning of 1999 to 2004. Thus the IRF may have been disadvantaged because of the learning curve with external fixation in the beginning, whilst the TSF may have allowed for good results from the start because of pre-existing larger experience with external fixation and deformity correction. Very few of the cases in the IRF group were treated prior to the published introduction of the Paley criteria [13]. These cases were mainly simple leg lengthening procedures, which to our knowledge did not deteriorate the outcome of this study.|$|R
