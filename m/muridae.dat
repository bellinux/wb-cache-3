25|$|In some <b>Muridae</b> the hallux is clawless {{and fully}} opposable, {{including}} arboreal {{species such as}} Hapalomys, Chiropodomys, Vandeleuria, and Chiromyscus; and saltatorial, bipedal species such as Notomys and possibly some Gerbillinae.|$|E
25|$|Taxonomists {{generally}} {{disagree about}} the most appropriate placement of the subfamily Cricetinae within the superfamily Muroidea. Some place it in a family Cricetidae that also includes voles, lemmings, and New World rats and mice; others group all these into a large family called <b>Muridae.</b> Their evolutionary history is recorded by 15 extinct fossil genera and extends back 11.2 million to 16.4 million years to the Middle Miocene Epoch in Europe and North Africa; in Asia it extends 6 million to 11 million years. Four of the seven living genera include extinct species. One extinct hamster of Cricetus, for example, lived in North Africa during the Middle Miocene, but the only extant member of that genus is the European or common hamster of Eurasia.|$|E
25|$|The rodents are solely {{represented}} by the family <b>Muridae,</b> and within this family, 29 genera are native to New Guinea. They {{are believed to have}} migrated to New Guinea during two different periods. The first group, called the old endemics form part of an ancient clade including other old endemics from Australia and the Philippines and likely migrated to New Guinea during the Late Miocene or Early Pliocene. The second group includes a number of species of the genus Rattus. These are believed to have moved to New Guinea later. Most New Guinea species form a monophyletic group with some Moluccan species, which is most closely related to the Australian group (one species of which also occurs on New Guinea) and to the R. xanthurus group of Sulawesi.|$|E

2500|$|Australia has {{indigenous}} placental mammals {{from two}} orders: the batsorder Chiropterarepresented by six families; and the mice and rats—order Rodentia, family <b>Muridae.</b> There {{are only two}} endemic genera of bats, although 7% of the world's bats species live in Australia. Rodents first arrived in Australia 510 MYA, undergoing a wide radiation to produce the species collectively known as the [...] "old endemic" [...] rodents.

A million years ago, the rat entered Australia from New Guinea and evolved into seven species of Rattus, collectively called the [...] "new endemics".|$|E
2500|$|The {{characteristic}} long tail of most rodents is {{a feature}} that has been extensively studied in various rat species models, which subsequently suggest three primary functions of this structure: thermoregulation, minor proprioception, and a nocifensive-mediated degloving response. Rodent tails, particularly in rat models, has been implicated with a thermoregulation function that follows from its anatomical construction. This particular tail morphology is evident across the <b>Muridae</b> family (in contrast to the bushier tails of the Squirrel/Sciuridae family). The tail is hairless and thin-skinned, but highly vascularized, thus allowing for efficient counter-current heat exchange with the environment. The high muscular and connective tissue densities of the tail, along with ample muscle attachment sites along its plentiful caudal vertebrae facilitate specific proprioceptive senses to help orient the rodent in a three dimensional environment. Lastly, murids have evolved a unique defense mechanism termed [...] "degloving" [...] which allows for escape from predation through {{the loss of the}} outermost integument layer on the tail. However, this mechanism is associated with multiple pathologies that {{have been the subject of}} investigation.|$|E
