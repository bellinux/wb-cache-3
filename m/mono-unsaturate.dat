In the present work we show that the <b>mono-unsaturates</b> palmitoleate (C 16 : 1) or oleate (C 18 : 1) also cause marked inhibition of apoptosis induced by exposure of clonal BRIN-BD 11 β-cells to serum withdrawal {{or a combination of}} interleukin- 1 β plus interferon-γ. This response was dose-dependent and not accompanied by changes in NO formation.

40|$|Background and purpose: Exposure of {{pancreatic}} β-cells to long-chain free {{fatty acids}} leads to differential responses according to the chain length and degree of unsaturation. In particular, long-chain saturated molecules such as palmitate (C 16 : 0) cause apoptosis, whereas equivalent <b>mono-unsaturated</b> species (for example, palmitoleate (C 16 : 1)) are not overtly toxic. Moreover, <b>mono-unsaturates</b> exert a powerful cytoprotective response against a range of proapoptotic stimuli.

Whereas no pressure-induced correlation-field splitting of the CH 2 ̆ 082 scissoring or rocking modes is observed in the spectra of the dimonounsaturated system (DOPC), both of these modes split at high pressure (> 8 kbar) in the spectra of the <b>mono-unsaturated</b> systems (POPC, OPPC and HOPC). The observation of this splitting rules out a parallel orientation of the acyl chains in the <b>mono-unsaturated</b> systems. The very weak CH 2 ̆ 082 band progression observed in the gel phase spectra of the monoenoic lecithins indicates that the oleoyl chain in these systems is significantly disordered, whereas the strong band progression observed in the gel phase of DOPC suggests that the polymethylene chain segments of the oleoyl chains are in their trans conformation.

40|$|The {{response}} of lipid membranes {{to changes in}} external pressure is important for many biological processes, and {{it can also be}} exploited for technological applications. In this work, we employ all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the changes in the physical properties of phospholipid bilayers brought about by high pressure (1000 bar).

Various structural, mechanical and dynamical features are found to be altered by the pressure increase in both bilayers.

In this study, we investigated the role of VLCFA biosynthesis in X-ALD fibroblasts. Our data demonstrate that elongation of both saturated and <b>mono-unsaturated</b> VLCFAs is enhanced in fibroblasts from patients with peroxisomal beta-oxidation defects including X-ALD, and peroxisome biogenesis disorders. These data indicate that enhanced VLCFA elongation is a general phenomenon associated with an impairment in peroxisomal beta-oxidation, and not specific for X-ALD alone. Analysis of plasma samples from patients with X-ALD and different peroxisomal beta-oxidation deficiencies revealed increased concentrations of VLCFAs up to 32 carbons. We infer that enhanced elongation does not result from impaired peroxisomal beta-oxidation alone, but {{is due to the}} additional effect of unchecked chain elongation. We demonstrate that elongated VLCFAs are incorporated into complex lipids. The role of chain elongation was also studied retrospectively in samples from patients with X-ALD previously treated with "Lorenzo's oil. " We found that the decrease in plasma C 26 : 0 previously found is offset by the increase of <b>mono-unsaturated</b> VLCFAs, not measured previously during the trial. We conclude that evaluation of treatment protocols for disorders of peroxisomal beta-oxidation making use of plasma samples should include the measurement of saturated and unsaturated VLCFAs of chain lengths above 26 carbon atoms.

The esterified oleic/stearic acid ratio of the neutral lipid fraction in cumulus cells decreased in the presence of SCD inhibitors when COCs were exposed to saturated free fatty acids during maturation, indicating the SCD specific conversion of saturated fatty acids under non-inhibiting conditions.

40|$|X-linked {{adrenoleukodystrophy}} (ALD) is {{the most}} common leukodystrophy with a birth incidence of 1 : 14, 700. ALD is characterized by impaired beta-oxidation and enhanced elongation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) due to a defect in the peroxisomal transmembrane protein ABCD 1. The first part of this theses is focused on improving the diagnosis of ALD. To this end, a method is described which can be used to measure beta-oxidation and de novo synthesis in living cells by using stable-isotope labelled substrates. Diagnosing women with ALD can be challenging since 20 % have normal VLCFA plasma levels. This thesis shows that C 26 : 0 -lysoPC (the biomarker currently used to detect ALD in newborn screening programs) is a more accurate biomarker to diagnose women with ALD. Furthermore, C 26 : 0 -carnitine was identified as a good biomarker for ALD in an ALD mouse model and adult male ALD patients but failed as a biomarker for newborns and women with ALD. The exact mechanism behind VLCFA toxicity has not been resolved at the cellular level yet. This thesis shows that exposure to VLCFA activates the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and causes lipoapoptosis in fibroblasts from ALD patients. Interestingly, only saturated VLCFA but not <b>mono-unsaturated</b> VLCFA activate the ER stress response. Via activation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, it is possible to redirect the saturated VLCFA synthesis towards the <b>mono-unsaturated</b> VLCFA synthesis.

Because lipids account {{for most of the}} heat produced, we have investigated: (1) whether the rate of appearance of non-esterified fatty acids (Ra NEFAs) is stimulated by shivering, (2) whether <b>mono-unsaturated</b> (oleate) and saturated fatty acids (palmitate) are affected similarly, and (3) whether the partitioning between fatty acid oxidation and re-esterification is altered by cold exposure. Fuel oxidation was measured by indirect calorimetry and fatty acid mobilization by continuous infusion of 9, 10 -[3 H]oleate and 1 -[14 C]palmitate. During steady-state cold exposure, results show that total heat production is unequally shared by the oxidation of lipids (52 % of metabolic rate), carbohydrates (35 %) and proteins (13 %), and that the same fuel selection pattern is observed at all shivering intensities. All previous research shows that mammals stimulate Ra NEFA to support exercise or shivering. In contrast, results reveal that the Ra NEFA of the rat remains constant during cold exposure (∼ 55 μmol kg− 1 min− 1). No preferential use of <b>mono-unsaturated</b> over saturated fatty acids could be demonstrated. The rat decreases its rate of fatty acid re-esterification from 48. 4 ± 6. 4 to 19. 6 ± 6. 3 μmol kg− 1 min− 1 to provide energy to shivering muscles.

The beneficial health effects of olive oil are due to both its high content of <b>mono-unsaturated</b> fatty acids and its high content of anti-oxidative substances. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the basis for the epidemiological information relating to the health benefits associated with the consumption of ex-tra-virgin olive oil (EVOO). The effect of olive oil on norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), serotonin (5 -HT) and gamm-aminobutyric acid (GABA) con-tents in different brain regions and histological structure of liver and kindey of male albino rats was studied. The chronic administration of olive oil (7. 5 mg/kg body wt.) caused a significant increase in norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), serotonin (5 -HT) and gamm-aminobutyric acid (GABA) con-tent in different brain regions (Cerebellum, striatum, cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, brain steam and hip-pocampus) of male albino rats. The increase in NE, DA, 5 -HT, and GABA content in the different CNS areas of male albino rat may be due to the inhibition of Ca 2 +/calmodulin binding which plays {{an important}} role in the release of these neurotransmitters. The results, also, revealed that urea and creatinne con-centrations in rats with oral administration with olive oil were decreased. Meanwhile, the activities of the enzymes AsT, AlT and ALP were elevated. The pre-sent results indicated that there is no change in tis-sues of kidney after treated with virgin olive oil. Olive oil may potentially be safe for use as a sedative drug. improvement also led to the reductions in risk of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases...|$|R
