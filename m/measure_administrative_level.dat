30|$|Second, we further refined the {{ownership}} network variable. The variable “different <b>administrative</b> <b>levels</b> of government control networks” was substituted for “the largest shareholder network” in the benchmark test while other network variables were kept unchanged. We continued the QAP analysis (see Table  5). In the same way, this test produced results {{consistent with the}} benchmark test. For the variable of different <b>administrative</b> <b>level</b> controlled networks, among all seven observational years, interlocking directorate relations {{are more likely to}} appear between companies with the same type of governmental controller. This result shows statistical significance in regard to QAP. For instance, in 2005, when <b>measured</b> by different <b>administrative</b> <b>level</b> of government control, the odds of companies with the same ownership to construct interlocking directorate networks is 52 % higher than cross-ownership interlocking directorate networks (see Table  5). Although cross-administrative interlocking directorate relations are existent, e.g., interlocking between companies controlled by the state council SASAC and companies controlled by provincial SASAC, the analytic results in this study show that interlocking directorate networks are more common between companies controlled by the same <b>administrative</b> <b>level</b> of government. Regardless of the approach by which ownership is measured, the likelihood for companies subject to the same ownership to construct interlocking directorate networks is higher than that for those companies subject to cross-ownership or cross-administrative level of governmental control.|$|R

40|$|Poverty {{and food}} {{security}} {{in most countries}} are highly heterogeneous phenomena. Both types and depth of poverty, measured {{in a variety of}} ways, vary between and within countries, regions or other geographic and administrative units. Poverty mapping in all its various forms involves techniques which permit sufficient disaggregation of a poverty <b>measure</b> to local <b>administrative</b> <b>levels</b> or small geographical units. All poverty mapping techniques imply alternative schemes for weighting a particular poverty index, and may imply alternative rankings by poverty of the chosen unit. The methodologies utilized are diverse, from participatory poverty profiles to sophisticated econometric techniques, and most are under continuing development. Each of these has different data requirements and implementation costs, and different advantages and disadvantages in their use. The themes of statistical error and possible bias are key issues in poverty mapping. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to discuss the relevance of and options in poverty and food security mapping for analysis and policy design and implementation in the rural sector of developing countries. We present and compare a large selection of the alternative poverty and food security mapping methodologies in use, in order to provide some guidance as to the possibilities and appropriateness of these methodologies for different policy applications. We do this by studying in detail a number of applications of poverty mapping to policy questions.

It is evident {{that the relationship between}} the <b>administrative</b> <b>levels</b> to which state-controlled companies are affiliated and their likelihood of building interlocking directorate networks is positive. All these results show high statistical significance regarding QAP. However, we also found that there is no statistical significance between county-controlled companies and nongovernment-controlled companies, which could infer that the enthusiasm of lower-level governments to participate in the administration of state-owned companies has decreased. In short, the findings of model 4 support hypothesis 4, i.e., the higher the <b>administrative</b> <b>level</b> to which government-controlled companies are affiliated, {{the more likely it is}} that these companies will build interlocking directorate networks.|$|R
