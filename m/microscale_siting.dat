30|$|We {{fabricated}} hierarchical MNHS using a two-step {{silicon etching}} process, consisting of dry etching (DRIE or Bosch process) for micropattern formation and electroless silicon wet etching for synthesizing nanowires. MNHS {{that lead to}} geometrically rough and superhydrophilic advantages for boiling application form hierarchical structures having micropillars or microcavities with high-aspect-ratio nanowires. The fabrication process is simple and cost effective, and can readily produce MNHS over the area of an entire wafer. By controlling polymer-removal technique, we can create an artificial surface with <b>microscale</b> nucleation <b>sites</b> favorable for bubble generation in boiling heat transfer. Specifically, MNHS will have a conspicuously large boiling surface area and superhydrophilic characteristics. It will improve the boiling performance over a broad heat flux range by introducing hydrophilic regions, removing hydrophobic sidewall structures that are usually formed in silicon dry etching process. MNHS having superhydrophilic characteristics can supply and refresh water to the surface more collaboratively than one having hydrophobic barrier structures. Thus, the burn-out of the surface can be retarded according to the increasing of a CHF limit and preventing film boiling. In view of these characteristics, boiling performance could be improved by MNHS that are accompanied by the geometrical combination of micro- and nanoscale structures and the superhydrophilic surface wettability. A design study for optimal MNHS, {{as well as an}} experimental evaluation of the performance of boiling heat transfer should be topics for future research, and are currently under investigation.|$|R
40|$|Phase {{change through}} boiling {{is used in}} a variety of heat-transfer and {{chemical}} reaction applications. [1 – 7] The state of the art in nucleate boiling has focused on increasing the density of bubble nucleation using porous structures and microchannels[8 – 12] with characteristic sizes of tens of micro-meters. Traditionally, it is thought that nanoscale surfaces will not improve boiling heat transfer, since the bubble nucleation process is not expected to be enhanced by such small cavities. [13 – 15] In the experiments reported here, we observed communications 1084 unexpected enhancements in boiling performance for a nanostructured copper (Cu) surface formed by the deposition of Cu nanorods on a Cu substrate. Moreover, we observed striking differences in the dynamics of bubble nucleation and release from the Cu nanorods, including smaller bubble diameters, higher bubble release frequencies, and an approxi-mately 30 -fold increase in the density of active bubble nucleation sites. It appears that the ability of the Cu surface with nanorods to generate stable nucleation of bubbles at low superheated temperatures results from a synergistic coupling effect between the nanoscale gas cavities (or nanobubbles[16 – 18]) formed within the nanorod interstices and micrometer-scale defects (voids) that form on the film surface during nanorod deposition. For such a coupled system, the interconnected nanoscale gas cavities stabilize (or feed) bubble nucleation at the <b>microscale</b> defect <b>sites.</b> This is distinct from conventional-scale boiling surfaces, since for the nanostructured surface the bubble nucleation stability is provided by features with orders-of-magnitude smaller scales than the cavity-mouth openings...|$|R
40|$|Den {{selection}} is {{a component of}} habitat selection, which occurs on several spatial scales. Brown bears (Ursus arctos) in the northern latitudes hibernate in dens during winter, which is their way to survive the period of cold conditions when food is scarce. On the smallest scale habitat {{selection is}} the most subtle, and for brown bears {{it has been found}} to be more linked to finding security than food. <b>Microscale</b> den <b>site</b> properties can also be important for the thermal conditions in the winter den. A successful denning period is important for the survival and reproduction of bears, which makes it essential to gain knowledge about the possible denning sites for the management of brown bear populations. In this study I examined whether male brown bears in Hedmark Southeastern Norway select for security, food and/or better thermal insulation when choosing a den site on the microhabitat scale. I also studied which factors in the denning habitat may affect the den type and occurrence of ant mounds (Formica spp., Hymenoptera), in which many brown bears use for denning. I used 41 winter dens used by male brown bears between 2001 and 2014 and 160 control points which were placed in the near surroundings of the winter dens. I did all my habitat measurements in the field without using GIS-based habitat data. I found evidence that the male bears in Hedmark selected for security in terms of horizontal consealment, either in the form of an ant mound or surrounding forest. The bears seemed to select for more horizontal concealment when choosing an open den. On the other hand, the bears seemed to select for less vertical cover when choosing an open den, which is probably due to the benefit gained from the thermal insulation from the snow cover. The presence of ant mounds was positively associated with selected den sites and within the denning habitat, ant mounds were more likely to be found in areas with bilberry dominance and in edge habitat...|$|R
40|$|The shock {{compression}} of Reactive Particle Metal Mixtures (RPMMs) is {{studied at the}} microscale by direct numerical simulation. Mixture microstructures are rendered explicitly, providing spatial resolution of the coupled thermal, mechanical, and chemical responses at the particle level during shock compression. A polymer-bonded aluminum-iron oxide thermite system {{is the focus of}} this work; however, the computational methods developed here may be extended to other reactive particle systems. Shock waves are propagated through the mixtures in finite element simulations, where Eulerian formulations are used to handle the highly-dynamic nature of particulate shock compression. Thermo-mechano-chemical responses are computed for a set of mixture classes (20 % and 50 % epoxy content by weight) subjected to a range of dynamic loading conditions (particle velocities ranging from 0. 300 ?? 00 km/s). Two critical sub-problems are addressed: (i) the calculation of Hugoniot data for variable mixture compositions and (ii) the prediction of <b>sites</b> that experience <b>microscale</b> reaction initiation. Hugoniot calculations are in excellent agreement with experimental data. <b>Microscale</b> reaction initiation <b>sites</b> are predicted in certain load cases for each mixture class, although such predictions cannot currently be validated by experimental methods.

40|$|Sampling was {{conducted}} within inshore and offshore sites, characterized by highly dissimilar hydrodynamic and hydrobiological conditions, in the Eastern English Channel. The eutrophic inshore site {{was dominated by}} {{the influence of a}} dense bloom of the Prymnesiophyceae phytoplankton species Phaeocystis globosa, while the offshore site was characterized by more oceanic conditions. Within each <b>site</b> the <b>microscale</b> distributions of chlorophyll a and several flow cytometrically-defined subpopulations of heterotrophic bacteria and viruses were measured at a spatial resolution of 5 cm. The inshore site was characterized by comparatively high levels of microscale spatial variability, with concentrations of chlorophyll a, heterotrophic bacteria, and viruses varying by 8, 11 and 3. 5 -fold respectively across distances of several centimeters. Within the offshore <b>site,</b> <b>microscale</b> distributions of chlorophyll a and bacteria were markedly less variable than within the inshore site, although viruses exhibited slightly higher levels of heterogeneity. Significant mesoscale variability was also observed when mean microbial parameters were compared between the inshore and offshore sites. However, when the extent of change (max/min and coefficient of variation) was compared between meso- and microscales, the variability observed at the microscale, particularly in the inshore site, was substantially greater. This pattern suggests that microscale processes associated with Phaeocystis globosa bloom dynamics can generate heterogeneity amongst microbial communities to a greater degree than large scale oceanographic discontinuities...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{critical}} zone evolves from coupled biological, physical, and geochemical processes that we quantify here across varying climatic and topographic conditions. The specific {{objective of this}} work was to examine how climate, landscape position, and vegetation drive feldspar weathering across the Santa Catalina Mountain Critical Zone Observatory, which exhibits considerable range in temperature (24 to 10 °C), precipitation (25 to 85 cm), and vegetation community composition (desert scrub → mixed conifer). Granitic soils and parent rock were characterized using a profile development index, quantitative x-ray diffraction, and electron microprobe analyses. Profile development indices increased linearly with increasing MAP/PET ratios (r 2 = 0. 48), with higher degrees of soil development in convergent footslope positions. Bulk soils from the desert scrub sites were enriched in total feldspar relative to quartz in both landscape positions, ranging from + 2 to + 24 % compared to the mixed conifer soils, which exhibited maximum total feldspar depletions of - 13 % in the convergent soils and - 3 % in the divergent <b>sites.</b> <b>Microscale</b> Na depletions increased significantly from unaltered to altered feldspar grain sections, with more tightly constrained Na losses in the mixed conifer grains compared to those from the desert scrub environment. Greater soil development and feldspar transformation in the conifer soils documented interactive climate and vegetation controls on mineral weathering in bulk soils and at the microscale. Furthermore, the larger profile development indices in the convergent landscapes demonstrated the importance of studying hillslope-scale soil development along environmental gradients, where localized increases in mineral transformation likely results from greater moisture availability and organic inputs in water-gathering landscape positions...|$|R
40|$|Chicken manure used as {{a natural}} fertilizer, given its high Nitrogen content, {{requires}} key actions in odor control that are often difficult to carry out resulting in an image loss for the company. Manure land-filling however is costly as well as incineration and this latter does still require odor control. Energy conversion from chicken manure may turn the cost into an earning that could payback both the investment and the image loss for odorous emissions. In this optic the paper analyses the different technologies that are available for energy conversion from chicken manure namely incineration, gasification, pyrolysis and anaerobic digestion with application to a real case. A large scale egg selling company in central Italy, with three production sites, was selected and its mass and energy flow balance assessed with particular reference to manure production and electricity consumption and expense. Five different technologies were then considered for energy conversion from chicken manure both for a single production <b>site</b> (<b>microscale)</b> and for the three (small scale). Grate incineration with steam production from exhaust gases was considered and discarded because of the too small scale. BTG gasification technology and IPRP pyrolysis technology presented by the authors, were evaluated and the techno-economic assessment showed interesting pay back time with medium to high investment costs and medium efficiencies. Pyrolysis technology with gas-steam combined cycle was considered but the economics show a very high pay back for the investment due to the small scale. Finally anaerobic digestion was evaluated showing the lowest investment cost and efficiency but an interesting payback period also considering that no public financing was considered. This latter solution has been presented to the company that {{will decide whether to}} finance the project...|$|R
40|$|Global metrics of {{land cover}} {{and land use}} provide a {{fundamental}} basis to examine the spatial variability of human-induced impacts on freshwater ecosystems. However, <b>microscale</b> processes and <b>site</b> specific conditions related to bank vegetation, pollution sources, adjacent land use and water uses can have important influences on ecosystem conditions, in particular in smaller tributary rivers. Compared to larger order rivers, these low-order streams and rivers are more numerous, yet often under-monitored. The present study explored the relationship of nutrient concentrations in 150 streams in 57 hydrological basins in South, Central and North America (Buenos Aires, Curitiba, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Mexico City and Vancouver) with macroscale information available from global datasets and microscale data acquired by trained citizen scientists. Average sub-basin phosphate (P-PO 4) concentrations {{were found to be}} well correlated with sub-basin attributes on both macro and microscales, while the relationships between sub-basin attributes and nitrate (N-NO 3) concentrations were limited. A phosphate threshold for eutrophic conditions (> 0. 1 mg L - 1 P-PO 4) was exceeded in basins where microscale point source discharge points (eg. residential, industrial, urban/road) were identified in more than 86 % of stream reaches monitored by citizen scientists. The presence of bankside vegetation covaried (rho = - 0. 53) with lower phosphate concentrations in the ecosystems studied. Macroscale information on nutrient loading allowed for a strong separation between basins with and without eutrophic conditions. Most importantly, the combination of macroscale and microscale information acquired increased our ability to explain sub-basin variability of P-PO 4 concentrations. The identification of microscale point sources and bank vegetation conditions by citizen scientists provided important information that local authorities could use to improve their management of lower order river ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) preferentially infects CD 4 + T lymphocytes and may exist as a latent provirus within these cells for extended periods. The transition to a productive retroviral infection results in T-cell death and clinically {{may lead to the}} acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Accelerated production of infectious HIV- 1 virions appears to be closely linked to a heightened state of T-cell activation. The transactivator (Tax) protein of the type I human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-I) can produce such an activated T-cell phenotype and augments activity of the HIV- 1 long terminal repeat. One Tax-responsive region within the HIV- 1 long terminal repeat has been mapped to a locus composed of two 10 -base-pair direct repeats sharing homology with the binding site for the eucaryotic transcription factor NF-kappaB (GGGACTTTCC). Tax-expressing Jurkat T cells contain one or more inducible cellular proteins that specifically associate with the HIV- 1 enhancer at these binding <b>sites.</b> <b>Microscale</b> DNA affinity precipitation assays identified a Tax-inducible 86 -kilodalton protein, HIVEN 86 A, as one of these HIV- 1 enhancer-binding factors. The interaction of HIVEN 86 A, and presumably other cellular proteins, with the HIV- 1 enhancer appears functionally important as oligonucleotides corresponding to this enhancer were sufficient to impart Tax inducibility to an unresponsive heterologous promoter. These findings suggest that the Tax-inducible cellular protein HIVEN 86 A {{plays an important role in}} the transcriptional activation of the HIV- 1 enhancer. These specific protein-DNA interactions may also be important for the transition of HIV- 1 from a latent to a productive mode of infection. Furthermore, these findings highlight an intriguing biological interplay between HTLV- 1 and HIV- 1 through a cellular transcriptional pathway that is normally involved in T-cell activation and growth...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{not unusual}} to find Cenococcum geophilum {{mycelium}} and ectomycorrhizas in high relative frequency in soil where ectomycorrhizal tree hosts are present. Unlike many ectomycorrhizal fungi, Cenococcum geophilum readily colonizes the fine roots of most ectomycorrhizal hosts. It {{may be found in}} all forest successional stages. Unlike most ectomycorrhizal fungal species, Cenococcum geophilum appears to have no distinct vertical distribution in the organic horizons of soil [...] though it appears to prefer organic horizons to mineral soil. Cenococcum geophilum also appears to have an even horizontal spatial distribution pattern at the <b>microscale</b> [...] and <b>site</b> level. This unusual distributional pattern {{may be the result of}} wide niche breadth of Cenococcum geophilum and/or genetic variation within the species. [...] A factor that may contribute to this wide niche breadth is the species ability to tolerate a wide range of stressors. Cenococcum geophilum isolates have been shown to tolerate freezing, salinity, and heavy metal [...] stressors, but is probably best known for its ability to tolerate water stress. [...] Hasselquist et al. (2005) found evidence that suggests that increased colonization of fine roots of Douglas fir seedlings by C. geophilum may alleviate water stress of the host plant during periods of low water availability. [...] Melanin biosynthesis, which is quite high in C. geophilum, gives its hyphae the “jet-black” appearance, and has been linked with stress tolerance in fungi. [...] It may thus be a key functional trait reducing water stress in C. geophilum. Other potential traits that C. geophilum may employ for water stress tolerance include the production and accumulation of compatible osmolytes [...] and the production of heat shock proteins. Nitrogen fertilization appears to have negative effects on the abundance of C. geophilum, which may be the result of host trees allocating less carbon to ectomycorrhizal symbiosis when nitrogen in the soil becomes non-limiting to the plant growth.|$|R
