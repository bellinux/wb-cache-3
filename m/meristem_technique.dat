40|$|Salinity {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious {{environmental}} stresses influencing agriculture drastically decreasing the production of crop plants throughout the world. Due to salinity thousands of hectares of agricultural land are going out of production annually. To cope with the salinity problem, there is keen interest in the development of crop plants displaying resistance to the effects of salinity. A series of experiments was carried out under controlled environmental conditions to determine salt resistance in Rapid Cycling Brassica species (RCB's) at germination early seedling and late growth stage. The effect of increasing salinity concentration was determined in vivo using a compost based growing system and also in-vitro using adapted tissue culture techniques. At germination and during the early seedling stage, low salt concentrations (50 - 100 mM) stimulated germination and had no significant effect on growth in B. rapa and B. rapa appeared to have greater salt resistance than B. napus. There was no association between salt resistance at the early seedling stage and that at the adult stage. At later growth stages, salinity affected both the relative fresh and dry weights and tissue ion concentration with K: Na balance affected in favour of Na. The relative salt resistance in the six Brassica species was associated with the reduction in the total fresh weight of shoots of salt-treatment plants expressed as the percentage of control but was not associated with K., Na concentration or K/Na ratio in shoots. B. napus and B. carinata showed the greatest salt resistance, B. juncea, B. rapa and B. nigra were intermediate whilst B. oleracea was salt sensitive. Conventional selection for salt resistance was not successful in this study because B. oleracea, B. napus and B. carina/a were not able to complete either their vegetative or reproductive phases and died before completion of the first selection cycle. Whilst, ten percent of plants of B. rapa, B. nigra and B. juncea managed to complete the first selection cycle they failed to complete the second selection cycle. Although, callus induction and maintenance were successful for all 6 RCB's, regeneration of shoots from callus was poor. Also, callus-based selection for salt resistance was unsatisfactory and had variable results and it was concluded that this was not a promising avenue for improving salt resistance in RCB's A cauliflower curd <b>meristem</b> <b>technique</b> was adapted for in-vitro mutagenesis and selection. Mutagenesis was carried out using two mutagens N-nitroso-N-ethylurea or nitroso-methylurea at 1 mM and 2. 5 mM. 300 green shoots were recovered from more than 1, 000, 000 explants mutagenised in liquid medium supplemented with 3 mM hydroxyproline as a selection agent. Of eighty in-vitro shoots which where measured for proline content, twelve showed higher proline level than controls. Leaf strip assays of the twelve selected in-vitro shoots and in-vivo weaned plants exposed to a 3 mM and 10 mM hydroxyproline assay showed greater resistance than controls. A few selections also had cross-resistance to salt at 550 mM NaCl and to frost at - 7 °C. These results successfully indicated the existence of great opportunities for the production of stress resistance cauliflower plants via mutagenesis and hydroxyproline selection...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the {{techniques}} for tracking cell signal in GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) images of growing cell colonies. We use such tracking for both data extraction and dynamic modeling of intracellular processes. The techniques {{are based on}} optimization of energy functions, which simultaneously determines cell correspondences, while estimating the mapping functions. In addition to spatial mappings such as affine and Thin-Plate Spline mapping, the cell growth and cell division histories must be estimated as well. Different levels of joint optimization are discussed. The most unusual tracking feature addressed in this paper {{is the possibility of}} one-to-two correspondences caused by cell division. A novel extended softassign algorithm for solutions of one-to-many correspondences is detailed in this paper. The techniques are demonstrated on three sets of data: growing bacillus Subtillus and e-coli colonies and a developing plant shoot apical <b>meristem.</b> The <b>techniques</b> are currently used by biologists for data extraction and hypothesis formation...|$|R

Two different garlic species (Allium sativum and Allium tuncelianum) and two different nutrient media were used in this experiment. Results showed that Medium 2 was more successful compared to Medium 1 for both A. tuncelianum and A. sativum (Kastamonu garlic clone). In vitro plants obtained via meristem and shoot tip cultures were tested for determination of onion yellow dwarf virus (OYDV) and leek yellow stripe virus (LYSV) through real-time PCR assay. In garlic plants propagated via meristem culture, we could not detect any virus. OYDV and LYSV viruses were detected in plants obtained via shoot tip culture. OYDV virus was observed in amount of 80 % and 73 % of tested plants for A. tuncelianum and A. sativum, respectively. LYSV virus was found in amount of 67 % of tested plants of A. tuncelianum and in amount of 87 % of tested plants of A. sativum in this study...|$|R
40|$|Sugarcane white leaf disease {{caused by}} phytoplasma {{is a serious}} problem for {{sugarcane}} production in Thailand. The pathogen can mainly be transmitted by insect vectors such as leafhoppers, and through seed cane. Planting of disease free seed cane is an important method for reducing the disease. However, the plants may be re-infected by insect vectors. Therefore, the disease free seed cane utilization to decrease the disease was evaluated during 2006 - 2011. Sugarcane white leaf disease free seedlings were produced by apical <b>meristem</b> culture <b>technique</b> with phytoplasma detection by nested PCR method. The Seedlings were transplanted and multiplied in sugarcane planting areas mainly in Northeast of Thailand. Sugarcane white leaf phytoplasma incidence was observed in plant canes, ratoon canes and the new growing generation canes. Phytoplasma detection was carried out only in sugarcanes directly planted by the disease free seedlings. Results showed that the disease free seedlings presented high potential for the disease reduction. Under low infected or isolation areas, the sugarcanes were mostly free from the disease symptom. However, phytoplasma was mostly detected. There was very few disease incident of 0. 0 - 0. 6 % found in the ratoon and new generation crops. Under high infected areas, the plant canes might show low diseased incidence (< 1 %). However, severe damage occurred in the ratoon and the new plant canes, growing from those seed setts of mother plant...|$|R
40|$|Bananas {{that provide}} a staple food to the {{millions}} of people are adversely affected by several viruses such as Banana bunchy Top Virus (BBTV), Banana Streak Virus (BSV), and Cucumber Mosaic Virus (CMV). These viruses are known to have a devastating effect on crop production and constraint to the international exchange and conservation of banana germplasm—a cornerstone for breeding new cultivars. The viruses are particularly problematic in vegetative propagated crops, like bananas, because of their transmission in the planting material. Different virus eradication techniques have been developed, such as thermotherapy, chemotherapy, and meristem culture for providing virus-free planting material. Meristem culture proved to be the most effective procedure to eradicate phloem-associated viruses. This method requires isolation of meristematic dome of plant under the aseptic conditions and culture in an appropriate nutrient medium to develop new virus-free plants. Thermotherapy is another widely used virus eradication technique, which is initially carried out on in vivo or in vitro plants and eventually combined with <b>meristem</b> culture <b>technique.</b> The plantlets are initially grown at 28 °C day temperature and increase it by 2 °C per day until reaches 40 °C and the night temperature at 28 °C; maintain plants at 40 °C for 4 weeks; excise meristem and culture onto the regeneration medium. In chemotherapy technique, antiviral chemical compound Virazole ® is applied on meristem culture. Combination of these techniques is also applied to improve the eradication rate...|$|R
40|$|Open Access JournalTaro leaf blight {{disease has}} {{recently}} been reported in Cameroon to cause between 50 and 100 % yields loss of taro {{in most of the}} agro-ecological crop growing regions. This has led to a significant reduction in disease-free planting materials, edible crop and increased. The <b>Meristem</b> culture <b>technique</b> has been used to produce crop plants free of viruses and fungi especially in vegetative propagated colocassia plants. This aimed at applying in-vitro micro-propagation technique for sustainable production of four local taro cultivars in Cameroon. This study was conducted at the Root and Tuber Tissue Culture Laboratory, of the Institute of Agricultural Research for Development (IRAD), Bambui from April 2015 to November 2016. Micro-plants from four local taro cultivars were produced in vitro from apical meristem tips. The tip meristems were excised from corms of the four local taro cultivars. The excised explants were surface sterilized with alcohol and sodium hypochlorite in sequence steps at different concentrations. Meristems were cultured at establishment stage on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 30 g of sugar, 1. 1 ml of 6 -benzylaminopurine and 7 g of agar. Shoots proliferation was induced in MS with 2. 2 ml of 6 -benzylaminopurine (BAP). Result shows a significant difference at p≤ 0. 5 in number of shoots, petiole length, open leaf and corm diameter among the cultivars and no significant variation in mean number of senescence leaf with respect to all the cultivars, at 60 days of shoot tip culture. At rooting stage, taro shoots were cultured on MS media supplemented with 10 ml of 0. 1 mg/ml naphthalene acetic-acid (NAA). Roots were produced on all the cultivars with excellent mean growth rate of 14. 7 ± 0. 69 recorded in cultivar with dark green petiole and small leaves. Peer Revie...|$|R
40|$|Biotechnology {{techniques}} {{have been widely}} used for legumes - important crops with excellent nutritional characteristics and soil improvement qualities. Limited work has been carried out with underutilized legume crops such as velvet bean (Mucuna spp.), which have great potential for multiple uses. In recent decades, there has been increased interest in the potential of Mucuna spp. as a cover crop and green manure for tropical and subtropical regions. Mucuna is also used as a minor food crop in many countries and interest in it as livestock feed - a common use for it in the early 1900 s in the USA and elsewhere - is growing. Other minor uses exist, such as roasting the seeds as a coffee substitute. More importantly, L-dopa, extracted from Mucuna bean seeds and plants, is used for symptomatic relief of Parkinson';s disease. Despite these numerous qualities, some constraints have limited its adoption. Biotechnology techniques can provide a window of opportunity for new or expanding products of Mucuna. Earlier biotechnology work with Mucuna was mostly related to its medicinal uses and focused on the mechanism of L-dopa production. More recently, biotechnology has also been applied to identify the major virus diseases affecting Mucuna, to develop new diagnostic methods for early virus indexing of in vitro plants and to clean virus diseases using <b>meristem</b> and thermotherapy <b>techniques,</b> as well as to study genetic diversity through the use of molecular tools. There are still niches to be explored such as the numerous phytochemical qualities of Mucuna {{that can be used to}} benefit human and animal nutrition and health as well as the environment through use of these compounds in natural weed and pest control management...|$|R
40|$|The Laboratory of Tropical Crop Improvement (K. U. Leuven, Belgium) hosts, {{under the}} {{authority}} of Bioversity International, the global in vitro collection of banana varieties (Musa and Ensete spp.). The aim of this international gene bank is to conserve all banana and plantain genetic resources safely and to supply the germplasm to any bona fide users. However, in vitro preserved germplasm needs regular sub-culturing, creating opportunities for losses due to contamination and human error. Moreover, an important problem associated with in vitro culture is the occurrence of somaclonal variation. K. U. Leuven was one of the pioneers to explore the possibilities of storing plant material in liquid nitrogen (at - 196 °C). However, for successful storage at - 196 °C, cells need to survive first a severe dehydration process prior to freezing and need to regenerate after thawing. In banana, meristems are the most suitable structures to be cryopreserved. Although meristems have the potential to regenerate, they still need to survive the dehydration associated with cryopreservation. In general, dehydration tolerance is achieved by a sucrose mediated osmotic stress acclimation. However, {{more than half of the}} collection consists of varieties that have a nonexistent or low cryopreservation survival rate. Hence, there is a need to unravel the mechanisms behind acclimation during the pre-culture of meristems on sucrose and to get insight into the genotype specific diversity. Understanding gene function and gene expression profiling can be approached via several techniques. A concise overview of the existing technologies is given with the emphasis on proteomics and proteomic technologies. Protein separation via two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and protein identification via tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is the most informative approach for a poorly characterized organism like banana. Proteins are relatively well conserved making the identification of non-model gene products by comparison to well known orthologous proteins quite efficient. Intact proteins (separated via 2 DE) are essential for a good and reliable identification. Chapter II focuses on the specific problems of protein extraction of extremely recalcitrant plant tissues and on the 2 DE separation. Protein sample preparation is a critical step and is absolutely essential for obtaining good results. Most plant tissues are not a ready source for protein extraction and need specific precautions. The cell wall and the vacuole make up the majority of the cell mass, with the cytosol representing only 1 to 2 % of the total cell volume. Subsequently, plant tissues have a relatively low protein content compared to bacterial or animal tissues. Banana is a good representative of a recalcitrant plant species since it contains numerous interfering compounds. Banana contains extremely high levels of oxidative enzymes (polyphenol oxidase), phenolic compounds (simple phenols (dopa), flavonoids, condensed tannins, lignin), carbohydrates, terpenes, suberin, and waxes. The majority of the plant protocols introduce a precipitation step to concentrate the proteins and to separate them from the interfering compounds. A phenol extraction protocol was optimized for small amounts of banana plant tissue (down to 50 mg fresh weight (FW)) and different sample preparation methods were evaluated. TCA/acetone precipitation and phenol extraction methanol/ammonium acetate precipitation (and only these methods) are both useful as standard methods for recalcitrant plant tissue. The optimized phenol extraction was most efficient in removing interfering substances and resulted in the highest quality gels. This method proved also to be useful for other plant species like apple, pear and potato. Chapter III focuses on the specific problems associated with protein identification of a species with a poorly characterized genome and discusses two complementary approaches. Proteins can be identified by comparing the proteins of interest to orthologous proteins of species that are well characterised. In one approach, peptide mass fingerprints (PMF) and peptide sequence information were combined to search and to correlate the un-interpreted spectra with the theoretical product ion spectra from different databases in an automated way. However, some orthologous genes retain a low percentage of identity and the chance of finding significant and conserved peptides decreases and a pmf-MS/MS approach might fail. A method that extracts protein-identifying information directly from spectra without being dependent on existing databases is extremely useful. However, deriving sequences from MS/MS spectra is not straightforward. MALDI TOF/TOF ion spectra contain in general incomplete ion series typically rich in various ion types. Attempts to simplify the de novo identification rely mainly on the simplification of the fragmentation pattern. The addition of a sulfonic acid group to the N-termini of tryptic peptides facilitates de novo peptide sequencing. The strong acidic group at the N-terminus is deprotonated and therefore neutralizes the positive charge of the b-ion by its negative charge. This results in simple spectra displaying mainly y-ions series. In this chapter, an innovative approach in which the extracted tryptic peptides are N-terminal sulfonated without any further sample purification is reported and successfully applied to banana. It was demonstrated that this approach results in a high and reliable identification rate and that it is adequate to identify different isoforms resulting from allelic variations, or from different gene loci. Now that the technical challenges (sample preparation and protein identification) are tackled, Chapter IV focusses back on the biological question, i. e the understanding of the mechanisms behind acclimation mediated by the sucrose pre-culture. Banana is an excellent model for the study of meristems thanks to the development of the shoot <b>meristem</b> tip culture <b>technique.</b> For the first time, a large scale study of a meristematic proteome is reported. The results suggest that the maintenance of an osmoprotective intracellular sucrose concentration, the enhanced expression of particular genes of the energy-conserving glycolysis and the conservation of the cell wall integrity are essential to maintain homeostasis, to acclimate and to survive dehydration. By comparing the dehydration tolerant variety (ABB) with a dehydration sensitive variety (AAAh), it was possible to distinguish several genotype specific proteins (isoforms) and to associate the dehydration tolerant variety with proteins involved in energy metabolism (e. g. phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglucomutase, UGPase) and proteins that are associated with stress adaptation (e. g. OSR 40 -like protein, ASR). This work proves that proteome analysis is successful to perform quantitative difference analysis and to characterize genetic variations in a recalcitrant crop. Chapter V examines the matter further to get a better insight into the acclimation process and to correlate acclimation with cryopreservation. Both, a dynamic study (screening over time) and a comparison between varieties are reported with the focus on the validation of candidate proteins. Although the sucrose pre-treatment and the concomitant high intracellular sucrose concentration are required for a low mortality rate after cryopreservation, it also induces negative stress effects. Sucrose pre-culture is correlated to high relative abundance of phosphoglycerate kinase, UGPase and OSR 40 and a low relative abundance of SuSy, lectin and chitinase and abscisic stress ripening protein-like protein (ASR). We hypothesise that a low mortality rate after cyopreservation can be achieved by a low relative abundance of SuSy and high relative abundance of phosphoglycerate kinase, OSR 40, UGPase, ASR and storage proteins such as lectin and chitinase. A screening of candidate proteins link several proteins and specific isoforms to the tolerant B genome, which opens perspectives to apply proteomics for taxonomical characterization and classification.
