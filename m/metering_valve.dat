5|$|Most {{variants}} of the CFM56 feature a single-annular combustor. An annular combustor is a continuous ring where fuel is {{injected into the}} airflow and ignited, raising the pressure and temperature of the flow. Other types of combustors include can combustors, where each combustion chamber is separate, and canannular which is a hybrid of the two. Fuel injection is regulated by a Hydromechanical Unit (HMU), built by Honeywell. The HMU regulates the amount of fuel delivered to the engine {{by means of an}} electrohydraulic servo valve that, in turn, drives a fuel <b>metering</b> <b>valve,</b> that provides information to the full authority digital engine controller (FADEC).|$|E

2500|$|The {{velocity}} of the air flow [...] entering the carburetor is measured by placing one or more venturi directly in the airflow. The venturi creates a low pressure that changes with the {{velocity of}} the air. As the air pressure in chamber A is decreased with greater airflow, the diaphragm is pulled toward the carburetor body. Chamber A also contains a spring that opens the fuel <b>metering</b> <b>valve</b> when the air flow is absent.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{drum brakes}} {{do not apply}} {{immediately}} when the wheel cylinders are pressurized, because {{the force of the}} return springs must be overcome before the shoes start to move towards the drum. This means that the very common hybrid disc/drum systems only brake with the discs on light pedal pressure unless extra hardware is added. In practice, a <b>metering</b> <b>valve</b> prevents hydraulic pressure from reaching the front calipers until pressure rises enough to overcome the return springs in the drum brakes. If the <b>metering</b> <b>valve</b> were left out, the vehicle would stop only with the front discs until return spring pressure on the rear shoes were overcome.|$|E

50|$|Operation {{begins when}} the controller/timer sends {{a signal to}} the pump to start the lube event.

40|$|A high {{pressure}} combined air-fuel injection {{system is designed}} and tested for an experimental free liquid-piston engine compressor. The application discussed utilizes available {{high pressure}} air from the compressor’s reservoir, and high pressure fuel to mix and then inject into a combustion chamber. This paper addresses the modeling, design and control for this particular high-pressure air-fuel injection system, which features an electronically controlled air/fuel ratio control scheme. This system consists of a fuel line and an air line, whose mass flow rates are restricted by <b>metering</b> <b>valves.</b> These two lines are connected to a common downstream tube where air and fuel are mixed. By controlling the upstream pressures and the orifice areas of the <b>metering</b> <b>valves,</b> desired A/F ratios can be achieved.

5000|$|MDIs {{were first}} {{developed}} in 1955 by Riker Laboratories, now {{a subsidiary of}} 3M Healthcare. [...] At that time MDIs represented a convergence of two relatively new technologies, the CFC propellant and the Meshburg <b>metering</b> <b>valve</b> which was originally designed for dispensing perfume. The initial design by Riker used a glass canister coated with a vinyl plastic to improve its resilience. [...] By 1956 Riker had developed two MDI based products, the Medihaler-Ept containing epinephrine and the Medihaler-Iso containing Isoprenaline. [...] Both products are agonists which provide short term relief from asthma symptoms and have now largely been replaced in asthma treatment by salbutamol, which is more selective.|$|E
50|$|In 1956, a {{technology}} competing against the nebulizer was launched by Riker Laboratories (3M), {{in the form}} of pressurized metered-dose inhalers, with Medihaler-iso (isoprenaline) and Medihaler-epi (adrenaline) as the two first products. In these devices, the drug is cold-fill and delivered in exact doses through some special <b>metering</b> <b>valves,</b> driven by a gas propellant technology (i.e. Freon or a less environmentally damaging HFA).|$|R
5000|$|A {{single line}} {{progressive}} system uses lubricant flow to cycle individual <b>metering</b> <b>valves</b> and valve assemblies.

If one piston doesn’t shift, none of the following pistons will shift. Valve output is not adjustable.|$|R
30|$|To {{control or}} {{regulate}} fluid velocity or fluid flow rate within a horizontal well, flow control devices (FCDs) are implemented (Foster et al. 1987). The larger family of devices accomplish this task in {{a multitude of}} roles, inclusive {{but not limited to}} subsurface safety valves (SSSVs), wellhead chokes, flow <b>metering</b> <b>valves,</b> valves downstream of the well within the process chain (surface safety valves), and downhole throttles on reservoir flux (Denney 2015; Li et al. 2013). Used in this fashion, downhole FCDs are often referred to in industry as “inflow control devices” or “injection control devices” (ICDs), depending on the direction of reservoir flux (Banerjee and Hascakir 2015; Bybee 2008; Jain et al. 2013).|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of hydraulic systems are controlled using a <b>metering</b> <b>valve</b> {{or the use}} of variable displacement pumps. <b>Metering</b> <b>valve</b> control is compact and has a high control bandwidth, but it is energy inefficient due to throttling losses. Variable displacement pumps are far more efficient as the pump only produces the required flow, but comes with the cost of additional bulk, sluggish response, and added cost. In a previous paper [1], a hydromechanical analog of an electronic switch-mode power supply was proposed to create the functional equivalent of a variable displacement pump. This approach combines a fixed displacement pump with a pulse-width-modulated (PWM) on/off valve, a check valve, and an accumulator. The effective pump displacement can be varied by adjusting the PWM duty ratio. Since on/off valves exhibit low loss when fully open or fully closed, the proposed system is potentially more energy efficient than <b>metering</b> <b>valve</b> control, while achieving this efficiency without many of the shortcomings of traditional variable displacement pumps. The system also allows for a host of programmable features that can be implemented via control of the PWM duty ratio. This paper presents initial experimental validation of the concept as well as an investigation of the system efficiency. The experimental apparatus was built using available off-the-shelf components and uses a linear proportional spindle valve as the PWM valve. Experimental results confirm that the proposed approach can achieve variable control function more efficiently than a valve controlled system, and that by increasing the PWM frequency and adding closed-loop control can decrease syste...|$|E

50|$|As the {{majority}} of transmission lines, transport systems and storage reservoirs are manufactured with soft carbon steel, all stages of a pipeline are vulnerable to erosion of pipeline components in the transmission line by exposure to Black Powder. Iron sulfides and iron oxides significantly damage components from {{the origin of the}} pipeline to the final product delivery because prior to precipitation, they are at and below sub-micron levels, therefore undetectable when passing through sensors and meters. Black Powder, at this size, damages pump seals, <b>meters,</b> <b>valves,</b> and compressor components because it plates out and wears on exchangers, trays, orifices and valves. These compromised components and instrumentation, lead to flow restriction and disrupted pressure boundaries.|$|R
