50|$|To {{prepare the}} stone walls of the {{buildings}} for frescoes, the walls were first covered {{with a mixture of}} mud and straw, then thinly coated with lime plaster and lastly layers of fine plaster. The palette of the paintings consists of white (from the lime plaster), red (derived from ferrous earths and haematite), yellow (from yellow ochre), blue (either Egyptian blue, glaucophane, or possibly azurite), and <b>mineral</b> <b>black.</b> The ancient Theran artists made full use of their colors: yellow was used for the golden fur of lions or the skin of youths, and as a stand-in for light green for painted plants such as myrtle. Blue was used as a dark gray to indicate birds, animal pelts, fish scales, and the shaven heads of young figures. Deep blue was also used to suggest the deep green of ivy, papyrus, lily, reeds, and palm trees. White indicated the pale skin of female figures while red was used for the darker, sun-tanned skin of males.|$|E

3000|$|... “Black earth” is a {{term that}} designates a large variety of black {{pigments}} including inorganic and organic compounds, such as <b>mineral</b> <b>black</b> (graphite), (black) iron oxides and carbon-based pigments [1, 2]. This definition is vague, general and unclear; no specific indications are given {{about the origin of}} raw materials, their chemical and mineralogical composition or the use in decorative arts such as wall and mural paintings, the stability and permanence with organic and inorganic media. Chemical composition is reported for ‘black earths’ on 16 th c. panels and canvas where sulphur-rich coal type black, Mn black, Sb black, Bi black and metallic powder such [...] as tin-rich bronze and galena were identified [3]. An attempt to characterize black earth raw materials in Veneto (Italy), also including other Fe-based earths, was carried out recently [4]; some analytical data are integrated and discussed here.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Coastlines {{and birds}} {{blackened}} by mineral oil are an icon for {{the risks involved}} in the transport of mineral oils. Regulations governing such transport have been developed {{since the end of}} the 19 th century. In the 1970 s, international environmental protection standards were introduced through Annex I of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution by Ships and it’s Amendments (MARPOL 73 / 78) for <b>mineral</b> (<b>black)</b> oil tankers. Regulation of the maritime transport of other bulk liquids, such as chemicals, in special tank ships (chemical tankers) has also been developed since that time (as Annex II to MARPOL), thus leaving the transport of vegetable oils more or less unregulated. Today, about a third of the tank ship capacity non-licensed for mineral oils is used for vegetable (white) oils. Volumes are increasing. Marine environmental protection became an issue when fl oating vegetable oils coated birds and European coastlines in the early 1990 s. As this damage to birds were caused by operational discharge and not by accident, no press pictures of oiled animals appeared in the media. Th e revision of the environmental regulations was advocated only by experts in maritime aff airs and pollution prevention. It took the maritime community several years to acknowledge that white oils produced similar hazards just as the black oils and needed stricter regulations...|$|E
40|$|Organic {{compounds}} in wastewaters coming from textile and pharmaceutical industry generated multiple harmful {{effects on the}} environment and the human health. One of them is the methyl orange (MeO), an azoic dye considered to be a recalcitrant compound. The heterogeneous photocatalysis emerges as an alternative for treating this type of hazardous compounds, through the generation of OH radicals using radiation and a semiconductor oxide. According to the author’s knowledge, catalysts such as TiO 2 doped with metals show high efficiency in degrading MeO; however, this presents economic limitations on industrial scale. Black sand can be considered as a naturally doped catalyst because in its structure is common to find compounds such as titanium, iron and aluminum oxides, also elements such as zircon, cadmium, manganese, etc. This study reports the photocatalytic activity of the <b>mineral</b> <b>black</b> sand used as semiconductor in the discoloration of MeO by oxidation and reduction photocatalytic techniques. For this, magnetic composites from the mineral were prepared (RM, M 1, M 2 and NM) and their activity were tested through MeO discoloration while TiO 2 was used as reference. For the fractions, chemical, morphological and structural characterizations were performed using Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-Ray (SEM-EDX), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analysis. M 2 fraction showed higher MeO discoloration (93 %) in oxidation conditions at pH 2 and it could be due to the presence of ferric oxides. However, the best result to reduction process was using M 1 fraction (20 %) at pH 2, which contains a higher titanium percentage. In the first process, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) was used as electron donor agent. According to the results, black sand mineral can be used as natural semiconductor in photocatalytic process. It could be considered as a photocatalyst precursor in such processes, due to its low cost and easy access...|$|E
