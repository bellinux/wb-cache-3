50|$|<b>Moroctocog</b> <b>alfa</b> (trade name ReFacto) is a {{recombinant}} {{antihemophilic factor}} genetically engineered from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. Chemically it is a glycoprotein. It is manufactured by Genetics Institute, Inc. {{and used to}} control and prevent hemorrhagic bleeding and prophylaxis associated with surgery or {{to reduce the number}} of spontaneous bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia A. It is partially a recombinant coagulation factor VIII since it has an amino acid sequence which compares to the 90 + 80 kDa form of factor VIII (BDDrFVIII). It also has posttranslational modifications which are similar to those of the plasma-derived molecule. It can not prevent hemorrhagic bleeding associated with von Willebrand's disease since it is not a von Willebrand factor.|$|E
