5000|$|The symphony {{has been}} praised by music critics. Lisa Hirsch of the San Francisco Classical Voice wrote, [...] "It's an engrossing work, full of {{interesting}} detail and structural experimentation. Like the Mahler and Ravel, it deploys {{a very large}} orchestra, but the effects provided by that orchestra seem more studied and less organic than those in its companions, thought through rather than arising naturally from the melodic and harmonic elements of the work." [...] Keith Powers of the Boston Classical Review compared the symphony with Harbison's 1999 opera The Great Gatsby, writing: The music shifts ideas incessantly: the opening Fanfare carries the flavor of Gatsby, presenting a pastiche of jazzy ideas, set in formal structures. The second movement offers a bewildering array of themes, connected by a mood of introspection. The scherzo, the most straightforward of the sections, lacks humor but suggests an antic energy. The centerpiece, a fourth movement labeled Threnody, begins with a string-based theme, deeply lyrical and pensive, with accents {{from the back of}} the orchestra. The Finale creates some ease for the listener, shifting to less tense, <b>major</b> <b>harmonies.</b> Matthew Guerrieri of The Boston Globe was slightly more critical of the work, however, saying [...] "...the whole symphony feels like workings-through, of influences, forms, processes, difficulties." [...] He added, [...] "The opening and closing movements had crisp force; the quieter movements, especially the piecemeal transparency of the 'Intermezzo,' were more skittish and hesitant." ...|$|E

50|$|The form of {{the third}} {{movement}} is a ternary scherzo and trio. It is in D minor, moving to D major in the trio (measures 154-288). The opening scherzo has two sections which are both repeated. The melody is characterized by frequent hemiolas and a half-step interval in the first section. The second section is more lyrical and is in F major. The trio is much more relaxed and retains the triple meter feel throughout, with less hemiola interruption. The piccolo is featured in this section, with a lyrical solo over pizzicato strings. The trio winds down with a long D <b>major</b> <b>harmony</b> and the scherzo is ushered in with string section hemiolas. The closing scherzo is almost identical to the opening scherzo, but without repeats.|$|R

5000|$|Gloag {{points out}} Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto as an {{influence}} in the Tippett concerto. The composer himself described the Gieseking rehearsal of the Beethoven as [...] "the precise moment of conception" [...] for his own work. Gloag suggests the quiet opening of the concerto, with the soloist introducing a G <b>major</b> <b>harmony,</b> as the most obvious fingerprint, from a compositional standpoint, to the Beethoven Fourth. The return of this opening gesture in the key of A-flat major, Gloag continues, [...] "reflects Tippett's engagement" [...] with Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 31, Op. 110. However, according to Arnold Whittall, Tippett [...] "turns the conventions of Beethovenian sonata form inside out" [...] in the opening movement. As opposed to the dynamic intensity present in Beethoven works such as the Fifth Symphony and the [...] "Emperor" [...] Concerto, Tippett allows [...] "change to take place gradually: ambiguity and avoidance of the explicit are exploited for their capacity to arouse expectations of coherent continuation." ...|$|R

The CTC's first Harmony report, Harmony and Disharmony: Exploiting al-Qa'ida's Organizational Vulnerabilities, was published in February 2006 and, along with extensive analysis, made primary source documents from the Harmony Database available to the public for the first time. According to the CTC, Harmony and Disharmony [...] "includes a theoretically informed analysis of potential opportunities to exploit al-Qa'ida's network vulnerabilities, a case study of jihadi operational failure, and specific recommendations for effectively addressing the evolving al-Qa'ida threat." [...] The CTC's second <b>major</b> <b>Harmony</b> report focussed on the Horn of Africa. Released in May 2007 al-Qa'ida's (Mis)Adventures in the Horn of Africa. provides a detailed picture of al-Qa'ida's efforts to establish itself in East Africa, what its successes and failures were in the region, and how conditions in weak and failed states affect the ability of jihadi groups to function. The report also included a second batch of declassified documents from the Harmony Database, with full English translations, and in-depth profiles of key figures and groups. The entire report can be downloaded. The third Harmony report explores al-Qa'ida's internal conflicts over the course of its history. Released in October 2007, Cracks in the Foundation: Leadership Schisms in al-Qa'ida from 1989-2006 analyzes further declassified Harmony documents in order to tease out the issues that have divided al-Qa'ida's leadership and details the factions that have struggled for control of the organization.|$|R

5000|$|In music theory, tertian (tertianus, [...] "of or {{concerning}} thirds") describes any piece, chord, counterpoint etc. {{constructed from}} the intervals of (major and minor) thirds.

Tertian <b>harmony</b> (also called tertiary harmony) principally uses chords based on thirds; the term is typically used to contrast with quartal and quintal harmony which uses chords based on fourths or fifths.|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{will focus}} on the recurring iconic patterns originating from the combination of music and lyrics within the Italian singer-songwriter tradition. The main work to be examined is "Storia di un impiegato" by Fabrizio De André while some attention will also be paid to "Il giorno aveva cinque teste"; the latter is the first album originating from the collaboration between the poet Roberto Roversi and the singer and composer Lucio Dalla. The type of iconicity present in these works arises from the interplay of music, performance style and lyrics, proceeding from the meaning of the text towards the form of the music or the purposely created sound effects. Iconicity here may range from a more direct representation of the object (iconic image) to a more abstract reference to it (iconic diagram). Music seems to contextually corroborate the meaning of the words (parameters such as <b>major</b> and minor <b>harmonies,</b> rapid or slow tempos, constant or variable ranges of pitch and dynamics are taken into account) and to guide the listener's attention whilst listening to the albums...|$|R
