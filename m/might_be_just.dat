Sometimes there were no Nairs at all in these villages.

He decided that a child-orientated spin-off series with K-9 <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> the thing. However, such a series would require a human as the lead, and his prime candidate for this role was Sladen. He pitched the part to the actress as a departure from what she had previously done: she would be returning as Sarah Jane Smith, but she would do so as the heroine and not just a sidekick. This offer Sladen accepted.|$|E

He praised the game for its graphics, but was critical of the gameplay. Mackey wrote that [...] "the graphics are far more impressive than any other Simpsons title at the time, outside of the arcade brawler. In fact, the graphics alone were responsible for my childlike [...] excitement over House of Weirdness; [...] they're pretty lush — even if they're not entirely faithful to the show. Bart's PC translation <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> a little off-model, but it's a gigantic leap over his duck-like visage seen on the NES." [...] He added, however, that the game [...] "is completely unintuitive, your goals aren't made clear, it's never certain if you're doing the right thing, and you're often locked into screens with no apparent way out but death."

Bob and John Nolan wrote that people who [...] "love to loop around the skies of Flight Simulator 5 will go bananas for" [...] the aerobatics; but the pair commented that combat flight simulator players [...] "might get a little edgy once the wow-power wears off." [...] However, Atkin believed that only those [...] "never happy without something to shoot at" [...] could be disappointed {{by the lack of}} combat: other players will [...] "be too busy choreographing aerial ballets, pulling off death-defying aerobatic stunts, or just enjoying a quiet soar down the ridge line to miss that stuff".

2500|$|Many causes {{have been}} {{proposed}} for this decline; {{a combination of factors}} is most likely. When asked why they do not vote, many people report that they have too little free time. However, over the last several decades, studies have consistently shown that the amount of leisure time has not decreased. According {{to a study by the}} Heritage Foundation, Americans report on average an additional 7.9 hours of leisure time per week since 1965. Furthermore, according to a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, increases in wages and employment actually decrease voter turnout in gubernatorial elections and do not affect national races. Potential voters' perception that they are busier is common and <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> as important as a real decrease in leisure time. Geographic mobility has increased over the last few decades. There are often barriers to voting in a district where one is a recent arrival, and a new arrival is likely to know little about the local candidate and local issues. Francis Fukuyama has blamed the welfare state, arguing that the decrease in turnout has come shortly after the government became far more involved in people's lives. He argues in Trust: The Social Virtues and The Creation of Prosperity that the social capital essential to high voter turnouts is easily dissipated by government actions. However, on an international level those states with the most extensive social programs tend to be the ones with the highest turnouts. Richard Sclove argues in Democracy and Technology that technological developments in society such as [...] "automobilization," [...] suburban living, and [...] "an explosive proliferation of home entertainment devices" [...] have contributed to a loss of community, which in turn has weakened participation in civic life.|$|E

And, as Pimp C explains on one of the album's many skits, a [...] "king" [...] is anyone that handles his business appropriately on the lyrical side of things, and many kings abound in southern rap. With such foraying display of bravado, T.I. has rightfully earned his membership to hip-hop's elite. Royal salute!" [...] Allmusic writer Andy Kellman gave the album a 4.5 out of 5 praising the album's lead single [...] "What You Know", and stating [...] "T.I.'s fourth album isn't the leap forward he's been threatening to make, but it does carry the best set of productions he has been given to work with, and it guarantees that he won't be leaving the singles charts any time soon." [...] Blender Magazine noted on T.I.'s status saying [...] "Before his album sold a surprise half a million copies in its first week of release, T.I. was a Southern star who didn’t quite feel like one: He made up with irresistible hooks what he lacked in personality. Now he’s a national star who doesn’t quite feel like one. A breezily charismatic drug rapper, he’s like Jay-Z without the worldview, Young Jeezy without the gravitas; he still hasn’t distinguished himself as an artist worth exploring past the singles. Thankfully, he’s packed album No. 4 full of singles, which <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> as good. His sonorous, self-assured drawl adds an air of unflustered authority to his alpha brags, and he pours it into unexpected patterns. What he’s best at is craft—woozy refrains and hypnotic rhyme schemes—and his fleet of beats is impeccable, highlighted by the four-minute epic “What You Know,” which laces imperious synths with an intriguing wistfulness. Throughout, producers Just Blaze, Swizz Beatz and DJ Toomp back T.I.’s self-deifying spiels with wild bombast: he’d seem a lot less kingly if it weren’t for his court." ...|$|E
