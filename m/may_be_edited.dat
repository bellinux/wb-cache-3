2500|$|In The Weakest Link, if {{the final}} round of {{questions}} ends in a tie (usually after three or five questions), the players will go into a sudden death round. [...] If a player successfully answers a question and the opponent does not in the round, the player answering correctly wins. If both miss or are successful in a round, they go to another question. Again, tie-breakers that do not produce a winner <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>edited</b> out of the final broadcast.|$|E

2500|$|Very roughly, {{there are}} two traditions of Mishnah text. One is found in manuscripts and printed editions of the Mishnah on its own, {{or as part of}} the Jerusalem Talmud. The other is found in manuscripts and editions of the Babylonian Talmud; though there is {{sometimes}} a difference between the text of a whole paragraph printed {{at the beginning of a}} discussion (which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>edited</b> to conform with the text of the Mishnah-only editions) and the line-by-line citations in the course of the discussion.|$|E
2500|$|In most {{international}} {{versions of}} the game show Duel, if two contestants do not cover the correct answer to a regular question when the duel is in process, the duel goes to a sudden death question called a [...] "Shootout". For this sudden death question, the contestants who are participating get 4 new chips each, {{and there are no}} accelerators or presses available. If only one contestant answers correctly, the contestant who has the answer wins. If both contestants get the answer correct, the contestant who covered fewer choices wins, but if both contestants do not cover the correct answer to the shootout question, they are both eliminated (that happens automatically if both contestants are wrong during the duel in international versions that do not have sudden death). In a situation in which both contestants covered the same number of choices during sudden death, both contestants win the duel, and one of the contestants, picked at random, must leave the show. [...] In some instances, if a winner cannot be determined on the question (regardless if both contestants tie or would be eliminated), multiple Shootouts may occur until a winner is determined. [...] In that case, the tie-breakers that do not determine a winner <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>edited</b> out of the final broadcast.|$|E
