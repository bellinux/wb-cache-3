However, the harmful effects and high risk of life threatening occupational hazards to the machinists as well as causing environmental degradation is discouraging to continue its use in the near future. In this work, micro algal oil, as a potential candidate for producing high performance <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> <b>fluid</b> is investigated. The preliminary constituent of base oil is produced using solvent extraction method with optimized reaction parameters.

The case of a 41 -year-old woman who developed symptoms of asthma after occupational exposure to <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> <b>fluids</b> is reported. The diagnosis of asthma was confirmed by an forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) of 1. 7 (59 % predicted), with 11 % reversibility after inhaled bronchodilator and a provocation concentration of methacholine to cause a fall in FEV 1 of 20 % (PC 20) of 0. 4 mg/mL.

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper has}} built a {{mathematical}} model for the evaporating characteristics of the grooved micro heat pipe’s thin film region and computed them in a specific working condition. The evaporating model of Wayner was employed in this mathematical model. The results from computation showed, for the H 2 O and NH 3 as <b>working</b> <b>fluid,</b> {{at the beginning of}} the thin film region, the heat flux raised rapidly to a peak value and then declined to almost 0 also rapidly in a very short distance.

Therefore, the alkali <b>metals</b> <b>working</b> <b>fluids</b> had larger area of high heat flux covered.

Efficiencies of removal of beryllium contamination from typical painted surfaces were tested by wipe sampling with dry Whatman 42 filter paper, with water-moistened (Ghost Wipe) materials, and by methanol-moistened wipes. Test plates were prepared using 100 mm X 15 mm Pyrex Petri dishes with interior surfaces spray painted with a bond coat primer. To achieve uniform deposition over the test plate surface, 10 ml aliquots of solution containing 1 beryllium and 0. 1 ml of <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> <b>fluid</b> were transferred to the test plates and subsequently evaporated. <b>Metal</b> <b>working</b> <b>fluid</b> was added to simulate the slight oiliness common on surfaces in metal working shops where fugitive oil mist accumulates over time. Sixteen test plates for each wipe method (dry, water, and methanol) were processed and sampled using a modification of wiping patterns recommended by OSHA Method 125 G. Laboratory and statistical analysis showed that methanol-moistened wipe sampling removed significantly more (about twice as much) beryllium/oil-film surface contamination as water-moistened wipes (p< 0. 001), which removed significantly more (about twice as much) residue as dry wipes (p < 0. 001).

A technique for assessing the concentration of surface—active components of both synthetic and oil emulsion metal working fluids is described. Results obtained using this technique provided evidence of surfactant depletion in oil emulsion fluids as a result of growth of a mixed fungal inoculum, but this effect was not recorded when these isolates were grown in synthetic fluids. Synthetic metal working fluds of known composition were formulated and the ability of selected fungal isolates to utilise both these fluids and the individual components thereof as sole sources of carbon and nitrogen was assessed. The <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> <b>fluid</b> components triethanolamine and diethanolamine borate were found to be readily available nutrient sources for growth of the isolates, the extent of growth being limited by the availability of carbon rather than nitrogen. Varying the initial pH of the medium was found to have no significant effect upon the extent of growth recorded at initial pH values of 7. 0, 8. 0 and 9. 0. The use of respirometric techniques provided evidence to suggest that some of the enzymes involved in the fungal degradation of synthetic <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> <b>fluid</b> components might be inducible. The effect of fungal growth upon the composition of the complete synthetic metal working fluids was determined using the techniques of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas—liquid chromatography linked mass spectrometry.

Case presentation: A case of a nonimmunocompromised female patient with Mycobacterium gordonae-induced humidifier lung is described. She spontaneously recovered after discontinuing ultrasonic humidifier use. When subjected to a provocation test, she demonstrated acute respiratory distress with signs and symptoms, consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Before and after the provocation test, water in the humidifier reservoir revealed only Mycobacterium gordonae by the microbiologic analyses.

The efficacy is that RTCE is assessed for varying degrees of cold expansion under different lubricating conditions at the tool-workpiece interface, such as dry, <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> <b>fluid,</b> and nanopowder. The plastic deformation combined with friction stirring at the tool-workpiece interface helps the RTCE in controlling the surface damage at entry and exit of the hole that is most often observed with the conventional cold expansion technique.

The results indicated that bio oils are suitable for <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> <b>fluids</b> but the effects of the bio-oils on cutting force are material dependent.

The characteristics and applications of a novel design of a thin film photocontactor {{based on the principle}} of irradiating a 'water bell' with ultraviolet (UV) light a,e considered in this work. Measurements of UV doses received by the liquid films in single passes were made using both actinometric and bioassay-based methods. The chemical actinometer employed was potassium ferrioxalate (K,Fe(C,o. l,) and the microorganisms used in the bioassay were Pseudomonas stutzeri (mRG) and a repair-deficient strain of Escherichia coli (NCIMB 11190). Good agreement was obtained between the doses measured using actinometry and the E. coli-based bioassay. At higher doses, good agreement was also obtained for the dose estimates made using actinometry and the Ps. stutzeri bioassay. In addition, a hydrodynamic water bell model, previously developed in the literature, was combined with a UV intensity model to predict UV doses with generally good results. Microbially contaminated <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> <b>fluids</b> were identified as a suitable medium for disinfection using the thin film contactor because they are not treatable using conventional UV contactors, and because the systems employed in industry vary widely in scale. Batches of contaminated emulsion ranging in volume from 200 to 1000 L were successfully disinfected. Representative members of the microbial population were isolated, and their changing status throughout treatment recorded.

The axial force, drilling torque and tool wear/failure are higher under cryogenic cooling when compared to conventional MWF. Therefore, in order to take advantage of the cryo- genic machining, new drill design is required, which cur- rently is not available on the market. International audienceCryogenic machining opens up new industrial perspectives in difficult-to-cut materials like nickel-based alloys. In particular, drilling is an operation that generates high thermal and mechanical loading to the drill. There- fore, tool performance, hole geometry and surface integrity can be highly affected. The objective {{of this study is to}} analyse tool performance during drilling of IN 718 using conventional <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> <b>fluids</b> (MWF) and cryogenic cooling conditions, and correlate it with the thermo-me- chanical phenomena. This study is conducted with standard coated cemented carbide twist drills, designed to work with MWF. The results show that drill performance under cryogenic cooling is strongly affected by its geometry. The axial force, drilling torque and tool wear/failure are higher under cryogenic cooling when compared to conventional MWF. Therefore, in order to take advantage of the cryo- genic machining, new drill design is required, which cur- rently is not available on the market...|$|R
