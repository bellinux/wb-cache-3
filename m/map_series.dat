25|$|Especially in the German-speaking countries, the 19th {{century was}} the golden era of the <b>map</b> <b>series</b> then {{described}} as Topographic Atlases. Most of the German states of the 19th century introduced their own <b>map</b> <b>series,</b> which were only later adapted, under Prussian guidance, to coordinate with each other. A trendsetter was the Prussian new survey (1:25.000), published between 1877 and 1915. Today, many of the present States of Germany sell reproductions of their historic <b>map</b> <b>series,</b> {{and some of these}} <b>map</b> <b>series</b> are also available as digital editions on CD-ROM or online.|$|E
25|$|Historical <b>map</b> <b>series</b> {{can still}} be used by historians, {{landscape}} architects, etc., for comparative studies. In contrast with single sheet maps, <b>map</b> <b>series</b> {{have the advantage of}} representing a larger area in a uniform manner and have documented card network designs and recording methods.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>map</b> <b>series,</b> still {{unpublished}} to this day, {{are probably}} the First Saxon land survey by Matthias Oeder and Balthasar Zimmermann (surveyed between 1586 and 1633) and the Swedish land survey of Western Pomerania (surveyed 1692-1709). The first published, and thus trendsetting, <b>map</b> <b>series</b> {{is likely to be}} the Carte de Cassini, published from 1756 and finished only at the beginning of the 19th century.|$|E

25|$|In most European countries, {{the largest}} scale {{topographic}} <b>map</b> <b>series</b> is a 1:25.000 scale series. Notable exceptions are Austria (1:50,000) and Finland (1:20,000).|$|E

25|$|A <b>map</b> <b>series</b> is a {{group of}} {{topographic}} or thematic maps or charts usually having the same scale and cartographic specifications, and with each sheet appropriately identified by its publisher as belonging to the same series.|$|E
25|$|A <b>map</b> <b>series</b> {{is not to}} be {{confused}} with a map collection, which is a map storage site and its contents, usually forming part of a library, archive, museum, or held at the premises of a map publisher or public authority.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of the {{selected}} type of division, there is a convention that four sheets of a particular scale map are used to depict the same area as one sheet of the next smaller scale <b>map</b> <b>series</b> produced by the same publisher.|$|E

25|$|Many non-European states {{limit the}} largest scale of their <b>map</b> <b>series,</b> usually to 1:50,000 scale, {{frequently}} {{due to the}} large size of the country covered (and hence for financial reasons). A noted exception is the now superseded USGS topographic map program of the United States in 1:24,000 scale.|$|E
25|$|To {{determine}} whether a specific map sheet forms part of a <b>map</b> <b>series,</b> it is often sufficient simply {{to search for a}} map sheet number. These numbers are usually printed prominently on the map sheet, and facilitates the identification of connecting sheets, either directly, or indirectly {{with the aid of a}} sheet index.|$|E
25|$|Consecutively {{in order}} of appearance: The sheets are {{numbered}} consecutively as each is published. Thus, {{it is not possible}} to determine the sheets neighbouring a particular sheet without a current sheet index. Nor is it always possible to indicate on a sheet's map surround the numbers of adjacent sheets, as the date of publication of forthcoming sheets (and therefore thei place in the numbering system) may not yet be known. This system is therefore suitable only for small maps, or those in an irregular sheet division (as in tourist maps published by the private sector), and is seldom now used for modern official <b>map</b> <b>series.</b> Example: Geological Atlas of Switzerland (1:25,000).|$|E

25|$|An older {{series of}} maps, the 15-minute series, was once used {{to map the}} {{contiguous}} 48 states at a scale of 1:62,500, but was discontinued some time ago for maps covering the continental United States. Each map was bounded by two parallels and two meridians spaced 15 minutes apart—the same area covered by four maps in the 7.5-minute series. The 15-minute series, at a scale of 1:63,360 (one inch representing one mile), remains the primary topographic quadrangle {{for the state of}} Alaska (and only for that particular state). Nearly 3,000 maps cover 97% of the state. The United States remains virtually the only developed country in the world without a standardized civilian topographic <b>map</b> <b>series</b> in the standard 1:25,000 or 1:50,000 metric scales, making coordination difficult in border regions (the U.S. military does issue 1:50,000 scale topo maps of the continental United States, though only for use by members of its defense forces).|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to surface weather maps, weather agencies began to generate constant pressure charts. In 1948, the United States began the Daily Weather <b>Map</b> <b>series,</b> which at first analyzed the 700 hPa level, which is around [...] above sea level. By May 14, 1954, the 500 hPa surface was being analyzed, {{which is about}} [...] above sea level. The effort to automate map plotting began in the United States in 1969, with the process complete in the 1970s. Hong Kong completed their process of automated surface plotting by 1987.|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} amount of new data for systems between 1851 and 1886 became available after a major basin-wide reanalysis in 1996, a project led by Jose Fernandez-Paratagas with the collaboration of Henry Diaz. The new data was constructed using old newspaper articles and the hemispheric weather <b>map</b> <b>series.</b> [...] Hurricane histories for individual states had been constructed by the 1990s as well, which proposed new storms and increased the knowledge of tropical cyclones already in the database. [...] Due to this profusion of relevant information not included in HURDAT, and evolving definitions for tropical and subtropical cyclones over the decades, the project was started around 2000 to update the official database. [...] Since then, the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set has been utilized to check for older ship reports which were either not utilized nor available to previous researchers.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Map</b> <b>series</b> {{are divided}} into {{particular}} systems of single sheets named and numbered according to common principles. [...] Thus, {{the characteristics of a}} particular sheet in a <b>map</b> <b>series</b> apply equally to all the other sheets of the <b>map</b> <b>series.</b> [...] So, for example, all sheets normally have the same cartographic projections, scale, and a uniform content and cartographic design.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Map</b> <b>series</b> {{occur when}} an area {{is to be}} covered by a map that, due to its scale, must be spread over several sheets. Nevertheless, the {{individual}} sheets of a <b>map</b> <b>series</b> {{can also be used}} quite independently, as they generally have full map surround details and legends. [...] If a publisher produces several <b>map</b> <b>series</b> at different scales, then these series are called [...]|$|E
2500|$|All {{sheets of}} a <b>map</b> <b>series</b> are {{created in the}} same way. [...] Thus, they bear all of the common <b>map</b> <b>series</b> titles, have the same author and {{copyright}} notices, use the same map legend and, {{with the exception of}} any possible edge sheets, are usually printed on paper of a uniform size. An individual sheet's title and number identifies and locates that sheet's place in the <b>map</b> <b>series.</b>|$|E
