40|$|Problem statement: Standardization {{of herbal}} drugs is a burning &# 13; topic in herbal drug {{industry}} today. Standardization {{is difficult because}} they &# 13; are usually <b>mixtures</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>constituents</b> and the active principle in most cases &# 13; is unknown. However {{it is possible to}} generate a physico-chemical fingerprint &# 13; for the standardization of these drugs with reference to authentic drugs, for &# 13; monitoring variation between preparations from different companies and for evaluating &# 13; batch to batch changes during long term storage. The present study was on the &# 13; characterization of some of the metal based herbal medicines which were in traditional &# 13; use for treating infectious diseases. Approach: Modern techniques &# 13; such as X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive &# 13; X-ray Analysis (EDAX), Infrared spectroscopy (IR), Thermogravimetric Analysis &# 13; (TGA), Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and &# 13; Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) were used to generate physico-chemical &# 13; fingerprint. Results: Our results showed that the metals in most &# 13; of the herbal medicines were in the oxide or sulfide form. Some of the medicines &# 13; contained metal particles in the nano range. Conclusion: In order &# 13; to bring out high quality herbal products, herbal drugs must be standardized using &# 13; modern techniques...|$|E

40|$|Deodorizer {{distillate}} (DD) is {{an important}} by-product obtained during deodorization process in the edible oil industries. It is a complex <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> health beneficial <b>constituents</b> like phytosterols, tocopherols and squalene. DD is not only considered as a waste material {{because it is a}} rich source of naturally occurring bioactive and nutritive compounds that make it economically valued. Owing to the intrinsic nature of DD the project was carried out for determination of these vital components by different analytical techniques as well as their application. The present work is divided into six parts. In first part of study deodorizer distillates of canola and sunflower oil were studied for their chemical characterization. Tocopherols, sterols, hydrocarbons and fatty acid composition were determined by Gas chromatography Mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results indicated that deodorizer distillates of canola oil (DDCLO) studied had higher saponification value in the range of (164. 24 - 175. 78 mg/g) and all deodorizer distillate of sunflower oil (DDSFO) having high iodine value (126. 19 - 127. 12 g/ 100 g). Peroxide value and free fatty acids were present in the range between 6. 95 - 8. 94 mEq/Kg and 35. 66 - 54. 38 g/ 100 g in DDSFO and DDCLO samples, respectively. Oleic acid (49. 29 - 51. 14 g/ 100 g) and linolenic acid (6. 18 - 7. 45 g/ 100 g) was significantly greater in DDCLO samples. Conversely, DDSFO contained concentrated amount of linoleic acid (52. 78 - 53. 26 g/ 100 g). Tocopherols and hydrocarbons were significantly higher in all DDSFO samples while, sterols were dominant in DDCLO samples. GC-MS provided excellent results for simultaneous determination of tocopherols, sterols, hydrocarbons and fatty acid composition of deodorizer distillates of canola and sunflower oil. Page In second part the changes of total and individual tocopherols were investigated during different sunflower oil processing stages by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The results revealed that the levels of total and individual tocopherol content were decreased during the neutralization, bleaching, and deodorization processes. The overall loss of total tocopherols during these stages was found to be 37. 9...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} the use of eucalyptus oils as both frother and collector in coal flotation. The application of eucalyptus oils as reagents in froth flotation dates {{back to the beginning of}} the process itself. It was realised early on that natural oils are complex <b>mixtures</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> different organic <b>constituents.</b> Essential oils of eucalypts are composed predominantly of terpenes, compounds which contain a sequence of two or more isoprene units (C 5 H 8) joined either head-to-head or head-to-tail. Monoterpenes (C 10) and sesquiterpenes (C 15) are the major classes of terpenes found in eucalyptus oils each of which can be divided into a number of sub-classes, varying across and within different species of the eucalypts. Ten eucalyptus oil samples were analysed using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry techniques. The results showed they contain a wide range of closely-related functional groups which might affect flotation. For each oil, surface activity was evaluated in a two-phase system using a froth column and a bubble sizer to estimate the dynamic foam stability index (DFI) and the critical coalescence concentration (CCC). On the basis of these parameters, it was shown that eucalyptol and α-pinene do not have frother properties and that E. Citriodora oil was the most promising frother, producing a better bubble size distribution than the industry standard frother, MIBC. Sequential laboratory flotation experiments were carried out using the tree-test on a Bowen Basin coal sample obtained from Peak Downs Mine. The Whiten equation was fitted to the experimental data to model the flotation response, allowing the frothing properties of the oils to be compared with MIBC. The flotation response curves were analysed using a new statistical methodology with the results showing that E. Citriodora oil has good frothing properties, comparable to MIBC. Timed laboratory batch flotation tests carried out to evaluate collecting effect showed that eucalyptus oils generally give a higher ultimate recovery, but lower rate constants compared to the industry-standard collector, diesel. Eucalyptol and α-pinene were shown to be the most effective eucalyptus oil collectors. The interaction between maceral species and the flotation reagents was evaluated using coal grain analysis (CGA). Flotation models are presented for different flotation products based on the microscopic characterisation of individual coal grains. The maceral and mineral abundance data demonstrate that MIBC floats vitrinite better than E. Citriodora oil, while their inertinite recovery is comparable. Eucalyptus oil collectors, compared to diesel, have better vitrinite recovery and higher inertinite loss to tailings...|$|R
