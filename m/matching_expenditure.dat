40|$|Tax earmarking, or hypothecation, {{refers to}} the {{assigning}} of receipts either from a single tax base, or as a proportion from a wider pool of revenue, to a specific end use; it contrasts with general fund financing of expenditure from consolidated receipts. The idea has been seized on both by {{those who want to}} defend the public sector who think it would make taxation popular and by those who want to cut public spending who expect the opposite effect. Earmarking may be applied in a strong or substantive sense, or in a weak or nominal sense. In the strong case, revenue determines expenditure, or at least revenue must <b>match</b> <b>expenditure,</b> and there may be associated referendums on the amount of spending and the tax rate. In the weak case, earmarking is purely formal — undertaken to make the system more transparent and to inform the taxpayer of the cost of a service. Earmarking may also be wide, covering a whole spending programme, or narrow, for a specific project within a programme. The principal example of earmarking (nominal) in the UK today is National Insurance contributions (NICs) which go to the National Insurance Fund out of which contributory benefits are paid. This paper considers the range of support for earmarked taxes, examines the issues, and asks if there is a role for such taxes in the British system. ...|$|R

If government revenues and/or expenditures are sensitive to cyclical fluctuations in economic activity then the budget position of the fiscal authority should respond to these fluctuations in the short run.

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleIntroduction Exercising women frequently present with a chronic en-ergy deficiency resulting from inadequate caloric intake to compensate for energy expenditure [1, 2]. In this popula-tion, energy expenditure may be high due to the added en-ergy cost of exercise. Therefore, when daily energy intake does not <b>match</b> energy <b>expenditure,</b> there may be inad-equate fuel to support all physiological processes [3]. As a result, the physiological consequences of an energy deficiency involve a cascade of metabolic and hormonal alterations that can suppress the reproductive axis and cause menstrual disturbances such as functional hypo-thalamic amenorrhea (FHA) and low bone mass [4, 5]. The optimal treatment strategy for women with exercise-associated amenorrhea and low bone mass is to target the source of the problem, i. e., the energy defi-ciency, by initiating a lifestyle intervention that includes an increase in energy intake, and, if necessary, a de-crease in exercise energy expenditure (EEE) [6]. Weight gain often occurs secondary to such treatment and has been observed to be a clinically positive outcome associ-ated with resumption of menses and enhanced bone * Correspondence...|$|R

The ESA does not protect species or ecosystems that are not endangered, and formally requires that conservation efforts be spread evenly across endangered species to prevent their extinctions. However, the focus of conservation science has evolved in recent years towards ecosystems and away from species. This paper characterizes the composition of optimal conservation spending when species are valued for their contributions to ecosystem services and not always for their own existence. The ESA clearly fails to provide ecosystem services when the species that provide them happen to be widespread enough not to be endangered. I show that the Noahs Ark design of the ESA is also unlikely to yield optimal conservation levels even of endangered species, and can push excess total social resources away from conservation and towards consumer goods. I show that private conservation can help to remediate inefficient distribution of government activity among species if the scale of government programs is modest enough to leave room for private initiatives to remedy accidental government misallocations. Finally, I suggest an alternative pair of policies that protect ecosystem services and <b>match</b> private <b>expenditures</b> on conservation of charismatic species.
