5000|$|Clay {{is chosen}} {{largely based on}} culture. For many western potters the choice in clay is based on how soft it is to use. But for many Japanese potters the clay choice {{is based on the}} {{finished}} look, not the <b>moldability.</b> It is a known fact that several of the different types of clay that are used by Japanese potters are almost impossible to use because of the stiffness and hardness. There is an abundance of most basic types of clay in Japan. Many porcelain clays are found in Kyushu. Kilns were traditionally built at the sites of clay deposits, and most potters still use local clays, having developed a range of glazes and decoration techniques especially suited to that clay. The pottery clays found in the Japanese archipelago range from fusible earthenwares to refractory kaolins. From the Jomon period to the Yayoi period, Japanese potters relied on high plastic iron-bearing shale and alluvial clays. Organic materials appear in much of the early Jomon period work, but sand or crushed stone predominates thereafter. Further refinements came about under the Chinese influence in the 8th and 9th centuries AD, when creators of Nara three-color wares and Heian ash glazed wares sought out white, refractory clays and enhanced their fineness through levigation. In Kyoto, where demand makes it both practical and profitable, the clay is crushed, blunged (made into slip), and filtered commercially. To use the clay, you must first break it up into small pieces, pour a small amount of water over it, and beat it with a [...] "kine", a wooden mallet, until you obtain the plasticity and uniformity of texture you want. Then you put it through an [...] "aramomi" [...] or [...] "press-wedge" [...] process, a kneading movement, after which the clay is stored for two or three days, or sometimes up to a week. Before the clay is ready to be thrown, it must pass through the nejimomi ("screw-wedge") process, which produces a bullet-shaped mass from which all air bubbles have been removed and in which the granular structure is arranged so that it radiates outwards {{from the center of the}} mass.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Parallel jobs {{characterized}} for having processes that communicate and synchronize each other frequently. A processor allocation strategy {{widely used in}} parallel supercomputers to optimize their performance is Space-Sharing, that is assigning a processors partition to each job for its exclusive use. The <b>Moldability</b> can reduce the queuing time by sizing jobs to the available resources {{at the start of}} execution. However, they will remain fixed even though the system load varies. Only Malleable jobs will be able to adapt to load changes. A way to simulate Malleabilty using <b>Moldability</b> is by applying the Folding technique. In this article we propose a processor allocation strategy to message-passing parallel jobs, based on Folding and <b>Moldability</b> concepts. This technique tries to decide the optimal initial number of processes, when to fold and the number of Folding times by analyzing the current and past system information. At processor level, we apply Co-Scheduling. We implement our proposal and compare to an implementation of Folding and some other <b>Moldability</b> from the bibliography.

Capillary rheometer with die of L/D = 10 {{was used in the}} investigation. Coarse and fine stainless steel powders were mixed with binders at powder loading of 64 % and 65 % volume. All feedstocks exhibit pseudo plastics behaviour as the flow behaviour indexes were less than one, but it is inversely proportional to the powder loading. Moreover, the flow behaviour index of the coarse powder is larger than the fine powder particles. Feedstock 16 _ 64 exhibits higher sensitivity among other feedstocks while 31 _ 65 was least sensitive to the temperature and pressure.

Working with polymeric matrix materials is known {{in the area of}} glass-mat reinforced thermoplastics (GMT).

RIM-technology now deals with two important advantages; low viscosity of the reactive mixture and fast curing.
