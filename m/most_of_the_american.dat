5|$|Relations {{between the}} United Kingdom and the United States were {{strained}} during the inter-war {{years and the}} majority of Britons were reluctant to accept an American as queen consort. At the time, some members of the British upper class looked down on Americans with disdain and considered them socially inferior. In contrast, the American public was clearly in favour of the marriage, as was <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> press.|$|E
5|$|Downman spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> War of Independence as a midshipman, with a spell in French captivity {{after his}} ship was wrecked {{off the coast}} of Ushant while chasing an enemy frigate. He was {{promoted}} to lieutenant shortly before the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars and served with distinction during operations in the Mediterranean. Downman served under several Admirals, and fought with Jervis at Battle of Cape St Vincent. Shortly after the battle he was rewarded with his own command, going on to capture several privateers and fighting off an attack by a larger vessel. Promoted to post-captain and given a frigate to command, he operated in the Mediterranean and performed services for the nobles and monarchs of the Italian states. Downman went on to command several ships of the line, often as a flag-captain, and took part in the capture of the Cape Colony and operations on the Río de la Plata.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur {{attempted}} {{to slow the}} Japanese advance with an initial defense against the Japanese landings. MacArthur's plan for holding all of Luzon against the Japanese collapsed as it spread out the American-Filipino forces too thin. However, he reconsidered his confidence {{in the ability of}} his Filipino troops after the Japanese landing force made a rapid advance after landing at Lingayen Gulf on 21 December, and ordered a retreat to Bataan. Within two days of the Japanese landing at Lingayen Gulf, MacArthur had reverted to pre-July 1941 plan of attempting to hold only Bataan while waiting for a relief force to come. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> and some of the Filipino troops were able to retreat back to Baatan, but without most of their supplies, which were abandoned in the confusion. Manila was declared an open city at midnight on 24 December, without any consultation with Admiral Thomas C. Hart, commanding the Asiatic Fleet, forcing the Navy to destroy considerable amounts of valuable material.|$|E

5|$|On June 6, 1944, and afterward, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> {{airborne}} landings in Normandy {{were flown}} into {{areas that were}} not studded with Rommelspargel. Some flights, however, came up hard against the defense. Accompanying the 82nd Airborne Division, Tito Moruza landed on D-Day with orders to don civilian clothing and make his way to Paris to seize Gestapo papers. His glider hit a wooden pole defense which tore into the three soldiers sitting next to him, mortally wounding them. More casualties were inflicted during delivery of glider infantry reinforcements when some 16–18 gliders landed {{in a field of}} Rommelspargel and the troops that crawled from the wrecked gliders were immediately targeted by German small arms fire. Of 250 troops landing, some 50–60 survived.|$|E
5|$|The 1948 Major League Baseball {{season was}} {{predicted}} to {{be a close}} race between the Yankees and Red Sox. In a United Press poll conducted just before the season started, the majority of sportswriters chose the Yankees, who had won last year's World Series, to face the Braves or St. Louis Cardinals that year, while others chose the Red Sox; only one sportswriter chose the Indians to reach the World Series. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> League managers had the Yankees finishing first, followed by the Red Sox, Indians, and Detroit Tigers. Tension and confidence was evident between the teams, as two months into the season, after defeating the Red Sox 7–0, Yankees manager Bucky Harris declared that the Yankees would win the pennant, though they were currently at second place at the time.|$|E

50|$|A younger artist, Louis Ritman, was Russian {{born and}} Chicago-trained {{and he came}} to Giverny in 1911 and spent the next {{eighteen}} summers there, even during World War I, when <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> had left for home. Ritman was highly influenced by Frieseke and he painted women in interior and outdoor settings, usually approaching the figure with some delicacy and handing the background in a manner reminiscent of French Impressionism.|$|R
25|$|Edwin McMasters Stanton (December 19, 1814December 24, 1869) was an American {{lawyer and}} {{politician}} {{who served as}} Secretary of War under the Lincoln Administration during <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Civil War. Stanton's management helped organize the massive military resources of the North and guide the Union to victory. He also organized the manhunt for Lincoln's killer, John Wilkes Booth. However, he was criticized by many Union generals for perceived over-cautiousness and micromanagement.|$|E
25|$|The British Invasion of {{the mid-1960s}} helped {{bring an end}} to the {{mainstream}} popularity of American folk music as a wave of British bands overwhelmed <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> music scene, including folk. Ironically, the roots of the British Invasion were in American folk, specifically a variant known as skiffle as popularized by Lonnie Donegan; however, most of the British Invasion bands had been extensively influenced by rock and roll by the time their music had reached the United States and bore little resemblance to its folk origins.|$|E

(64%), and the United Church of Christ (46%), {{as well as the}} <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> upper class. Episcopalians and Presbyterians also tend to be considerably wealthier and better educated than most other religious groups, and they are disproportionately represented in the upper reaches of American business and law. From 1854 until at least 1964 they were heavily Republican. In recent decades, Republicans slightly outnumber Democrats.|$|E

As {{a reward for}} his services Pye was knighted by the King {{on the deck of}} the Portsmouth guardship, the 98-gun , on 24 June 1773. At the same time the King ordered Pye promoted to admiral. Pye was replaced as commander-in-chief at Portsmouth on 18 May 1774, being succeeded by Sir James Douglas, but resumed the command on 27 May 1777.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the American Revolution, the {{institution}} of slavery was firmly established in the American colonies. It was most important in the six southern states from Maryland to Georgia, but the total of a half million slaves were spread out through all of the colonies. In the South, 40% of the population was made up of slaves, and as Americans moved into Kentucky {{and the rest of the}} southwest, one-sixth of the settlers were slaves. By the end of the war, the New England states provided <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> ships that were used in the foreign slave trade while most of their customers were in Georgia and the Carolinas.|$|E
25|$|In 1872, in {{response}} to the assassination of friendly Yavapai chiefs, the take-over of the entire Yavapai nation and its reservation by hostile elements, and with <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> area under continual penetrating raids by Yavapai warrior bands, General George Crook began an all-out campaign against the Yavapai, with the aim of forcing the insurgent Yavapai warrior bands into a decisive battle and the removal of Yavapai settlers from American territory. After several months of forced marches, feints, and pitched skirmishes by combined Arizona territorial militia and US Army Cavalry, Crook forced the Yavapai bands into a single decisive battle. In December 1872, the Battle of Salt River Canyon in the Superstition Mountains decisively routed the Yavapai, and within a year most Yavapai resistance was crushed.|$|E

5|$|Crawford led about 500 {{volunteer}} militiamen, {{mostly from}} Pennsylvania, deep into American Indian territory, with <b>the</b> intention <b>of</b> surprising <b>the</b> Indians. The Indians and their British allies from Detroit had already learned <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expedition, however, and gathered {{a force to}} oppose <b>the</b> <b>Americans.</b> After a day of indecisive fighting near the Sandusky towns, <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> found themselves surrounded and attempted to retreat. The retreat turned into a rout, but <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> managed {{to find their way}} back to Pennsylvania. About 70 Americans were killed; Indian and British losses were minimal.|$|R
25|$|Although Howe had {{defeated}} the American army, the unexpected resistance {{he had met}} prevented him from destroying it completely. The American morale had not been destroyed; despite losing the battle, the Americans had good spirits hoping to fight the British again another day. But neither commander in the battle had proven themselves. Washington had committed a serious error in leaving his right flank wide open and nearly brought on destruction {{if it had not}} been for Sullivan, Sterling, and Stephen's divisions that fought for time. Howe had waited too long to attack the American right flank, showing again his lack of killer instincts because he was still afraid of sustaining heavy casualties since the costly victory at the Battle of Bunker Hill two years earlier, and thus allowed <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> army to escape.|$|E
25|$|After the voyages of Christopher Columbus in 1492, Spanish, Portuguese {{and later}} English, French and Dutch colonial expeditions {{arrived in the}} New World, conquering and {{settling}} the discovered lands, {{which led to a}} transformation of the cultural and physical landscape in the Americas. Spain colonized <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> continent from present-day Southwestern United States, Florida and the Caribbean to the southern tip of South America. Portugal settled in what is mostly present-day Brazil while England established colonies in the Eastern coast of the United States, as well as the North Pacific coast and most of Canada. France settled in Quebec and other parts of Eastern Canada and claimed an area in what is today the central United States. The Netherlands settled New Netherland (administrative centre New Amsterdam - now New York), some Caribbean islands and parts of Northern South America.|$|E
25|$|The {{blockade}} kept <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> navy {{trapped in}} port. The Royal Navy also occupied coastal islands, encouraging American slaves to defect. Military-aged males were enlisted into a Corps of Colonial Marines while their families {{were sent to}} the dockyard in Bermuda {{for the duration of the}} war, employed by the Royal Navy. These marines fought for the Crown on the Atlantic Seaboard, and in the attack on Washington DC and the Chesapeake (see below). They also guarded the dockyard in Bermuda. When the members of the corps were offered re-enlistment into the British Army, most refused. After demobilisation, they were granted land to settle in the West Indies. Those who did transfer to the British Army were re-enlisted into West India Regiments and took part in the Louisiana Campaign (which included the Battle of New Orleans). Britain's liberation of enslaved Americans led to a post-war lawsuit, mediated by Russia, through which the U.S. sought reimbursement.|$|E
