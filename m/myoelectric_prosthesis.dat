50|$|A <b>myoelectric</b> <b>prosthesis</b> {{uses the}} {{electrical}} tension generated {{every time a}} muscle contracts, as information. This tension can be captured from voluntarily contracted muscles by electrodes applied on the skin to control {{the movements of the}} prosthesis, such as elbow flexion/extension, wrist supination/pronation (rotation) or opening/closing of the fingers. A prosthesis of this type utilizes the residual neuromuscular system of the human body to control the functions of an electric powered prosthetic hand, wrist, elbow or foot. This is different from an electric switch prosthesis, which requires straps and/or cables actuated by body movements to actuate or operate switches that control the movements of the prosthesis.|$|E
50|$|After surgery, {{the patient}} was fitted with his pre-surgery body-powered {{prosthesis}} {{on the right side}} and an experimental <b>myoelectric</b> <b>prosthesis</b> consisted of a Griefer terminal device, a power wrist rotator, a Boston digital arm, and an LTI-Collier Shoulder joint on the left side. Three strongest EMG signals were chosen from the successful nerve transfers: the musculocutaneous nerve, the median nerve and the radial nerve. The EMG resulting from contraction of muscle reinnvervated by median nerve was used to control hand closing movement; the EMG from musculocutaneous nerve was used to control elbow bending; the EMG from radial nerve was used to control wrist rotation and flexion.|$|E

To test the terminal device (“hand”), elbow and wrist rotator, the patient was administered a clothes-pin test, where he was asked to pick up clothes pins from a horizontal bar, rotate them, then put them on a higher vertical bar.

The quantified results showed that the <b>myoelectric</b> <b>prosthesis</b> performed 246% better (moved 2.46 times more blocks) in box-and-blocks test, and 26.3% better (used 26.3% less time in moving clothes pins) in clothes-pin test.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} intermanual transfer {{effects in}} patients with a below-elbow amputation using a <b>myoelectric</b> <b>prosthesis,</b> and to establish whether laterality affects these effects. DESIGN: Case-control. SETTING: A standardized setting in a rehabilitation clinic. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of experienced <b>myoelectric</b> <b>prosthesis</b> users (n= 22) and matched controls (n= 22). Controls were matched on sex, age (+/- 5 years) and hand dominance. INTERVENTIONS: Both the experienced group and the control group performed several tasks using a prosthesis simulator attached to their non-affected arm. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: movement time, force control, Box and Blocks test (BBT) -scores and duration of hand opening. RESULTS: Movement times of <b>myoelectric</b> <b>prosthesis</b> users were shorter and these users had significantly higher BBT-scores and shorter hand opening durations compared to controls. No intermanual transfer effects on force control and no laterality effects were found.

50|$|Several methods {{exist that}} seek to achieve {{advanced}} control of motorized neural prosthetics. Chronic brain implants record neuronal signals from the motor cortex, while methods such as EEG and fMRI obtain motor commands non-invasively.

Traditional <b>myoelectric</b> <b>prostheses</b> utilize surface EMG signals from {{the remains of the}} amputated limb. For example, a patient may flex a shoulder muscle in order to generate EMG signals that may be used to send “bend elbow” command to the prosthesis. However, there are shortcomings to all of these methods. Chronic implants fail {{over a period of time}} because neuronal signal degrade due to tissue immune response to foreign bodies. EEG and fMRI do not obtain as strong signals as direct electrode implant. Traditional <b>myoelectric</b> <b>prostheses</b> are unable to provide multiple control signals simultaneously, thus only one action can be performed at a time.

40|$|Upper limb {{deficiencies}} in {{children may be}} the result of trauma, disease, or congenital problems. Although biomechanical losses are the primary problem associated with a limb deficiency, the loss of such an obvious body part has cosmetic and psychosocial implications as well. Fitting a child with a prosthesis typically is the treatment chosen by families. Presently, there are three types of prostheses available for pediatric amputees, including passive, cable-operated, and myoelectric arms, but the myoelectric appears to be the most popular choice of children and their families. However, there is growing concern among clinicians that, despite its advanced technological capabilities, the <b>myoelectric</b> <b>prosthesis</b> is chosen for aesthetic rather than functional reasons. It is difficult, then, to justify the expense of fitting a <b>myoelectric</b> <b>prosthesis</b> when a more inexpensive prosthesis, or none at all, would be a more appropriate prescription. The question of when to prescribe a <b>myoelectric</b> <b>prosthesis</b> for a pediatric patient remains one of the most controversial questions in the field of prosthetics today due to this cost/benefit issue.
