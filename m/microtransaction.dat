5|$|Upon release, Fallout Shelter {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Critics {{enjoyed the}} game's {{extension of the}} Fallout universe, the core gameplay, and its visual style. Common criticisms included the game's lack of depth, its use of unnecessary microtransactions, and its lack of an ending. The game grossed $5.1 million in <b>microtransaction</b> sales {{in the first two}} weeks after its release.|$|E
5|$|While {{playing in}} GHTV, the player is scored to track their performance, and their scores are {{compared}} to other players - both those playing {{at the same time}} as well as asynchronous scores from other players. To help boost their score, players can accumulate Hero Power in the same fashion as in the GH Live mode. Prior to a song, the player can choose to use Coins, the in-game currency, to purchase one of several Hero Powers which they can deploy during the song, improving their score and performance. Hero Powers include temporary boosts in scoring multipliers, ability to clear all notes for a short distance on the track, or to increase or decrease the density of notes. When a song is complete, the player is ranked based on their performance with the other tracked players, and awarded experience points, Coins, and other bonuses. Experience points are used to raise the player's rank in the GHTV metagame, allowing them to unlock player card skins and other features of GHTV, including Play tokens. Alternatively, players can use the paid, <b>microtransaction</b> currency Hero Cash to purchase access to content. In an update in December 2015, players on GHTV have an opportunity to be randomly pitted in a head-to-head challenge against another player of similar skill level, about twice every half-hour. Winning this head-to-head challenge can give the player an experience point boost.|$|E
50|$|There are no {{internal}} <b>microtransactions</b> in the game. This {{means that}} the player pays only the box price for the game, {{with the possibility of}} paid DLC and expansions further on. Nival decided to abandon the idea of <b>microtransactions</b> during early testing.|$|R

5000|$|C.J. Andriessen of Destructoid {{rated the}} game 25/100, calling the game [...] "repetitive, tedious" [...] and [...] "digital Ambien", {{and stated that}} the game was [...] "un-fun" [...] without {{spending}} money on <b>microtransactions</b> to increase the XP gained, but {{also said that the}} <b>microtransactions</b> made the game too easy.|$|R
500|$|Famitsu, in {{a review}} of the game shortly after release, praised the combat and graphics, but found the touch {{controls}} difficult to handle. The reviewer finished by recommending the game to fans of the Final Fantasy series. Kotaku's Richard Eisenbeis said that the game went [...] "far beyond what [...] expected going in", noting that he did not feel outclassed by other players despite not using the game's <b>microtransaction</b> system. Shaun Musgrave of Touch Arcade praised the game's graphics and combat, comparing the battle missions to Puzzle & Dragons. He did question the general balance, but noted that the game was still young and Square Enix had the chance to smooth things out.|$|E
500|$|The GHTV mode has mixed opinions, {{with most}} reviewers praising the concept, with the {{presentation}} of the channels were highlighted as hearkening to the heyday of MTV, and giving the player the ability to explore new music. However, reviewers were critical of the emphasis on microtransactions, and though the game was [...] "generous" [...] with providing free Plays and other in-game currency rewards, this approach could still disappoint some players. Carter found that he could ignore the microtransactions and instead enjoy the freely-playable curated music channels, helping him to play music that he had not yet heard or was outside of his normal play style, giving him a [...] "a really cool feeling" [...] about exploring new music, as well as seeing music videos from his youth again. Ogilvie similarly found that he could spend his time in GHTV within the free channels exploring new music, but believed the mode was [...] "somewhat inflexible for the time poor" [...] as players may not find the type of music they want to play when they are ready the play and that {{there was a lack of}} a programming guide for these channels. Griffin said that the pricing structure was weak compared to established DLC models, believing that the pricing for options like the Party Pack would have been better used to unlock the ability to play songs that he would enjoy. Miller stated that the <b>microtransaction</b> [...] "structure is exploitative", preventing him from easily accessing his favorite songs to play and making him frustrated with the game in the long run. Buttersworth was displeased with the need to grind through songs in the free channels as to earn Play tokens to access a song he wanted to play, and the ability to permanently unlock a song, stating [...] "that lack of freedom undermined a lot of the fun". Premium shows were particularly noted as problematic, in addition to the lack of a practice mode for the GHTV songs, which may impact how those players that seek to perfect every song would enjoy the game mode. Tan noted that in addition to either the time to complete the challenges or in-game currency to unlock the show, the player would have to complete the show in one of the ranked positions to earn the offered prize, and if they failed, they would have to repeat that process again.|$|E
2500|$|Injustice 2s storyline {{centers around}} Batman and his insurgency's attempt to restore society {{after the fall}} of Superman's regime; however, the arrivals of the newly formed supervillain group [...] "The Society" [...] and the alien Brainiac forces Batman to {{consider}} freeing the imprisoned Superman to help combat the threats. The game received positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, presentation, improved gameplay mechanics, abundance of in-game content, and character customization options, while criticizing its random loot and <b>microtransaction</b> systems.|$|E

2500|$|While the {{customization}} options {{offered by}} the Gear System received praise, critics expressed frustration with receiving random, undesired gear through loot drops and the game's <b>microtransaction</b> system. GameSpot's Peter Brown found collecting gear and outfitting characters to be enjoyable, stating that [...] "watching a character's traditional outfit transform into something fresh or unexpected, and seeing their stats grow through leveling up and equipping gear, grants a satisfying sense of ownership over your accomplishments and possessions." [...] On the other hand, Brown criticized the Gear System's use of currency, particularly Source Crystals, saying that spending real money {{seemed to be a}} [...] "necessary evil" [...] for players to have complete control over their inventories. Kotaku's Mike Fahey described the ability to create custom versions of characters as [...] "quite satisfying"; however, he found the Gear System to be [...] "complicated" [...] and criticized the randomness in receiving desired costume pieces and equipment, uttering [...] "sometimes random chance really sucks." [...] Videogamer.com's Alice Bell also called the <b>microtransaction</b> and loot systems [...] "needlessly complex", which require players to keep track of several different types of currency. In contrast, Polygons Michael McWhertor called the interface [...] "elegant", enjoying the simplicity of managing and selling of gear for each character.|$|E

On June 24, 2011 video game website 1UP.com reported that Microsoft {{was preparing to}} bring free-to-play games to Xbox Live and said games will include a <b>microtransaction</b> service.

40|$|Abstract: With {{the advent}} of the internet, {{computer}} games have undergone substantial changes. Many games now contain some form of social interaction with other players. Furthermore, many games offer players the opportunity to buy upgrades using <b>microtransactions.</b> Based on social psychological theories on social comparisons, deservedness, and envy, we tested whether the use of these <b>microtransactions</b> would affect how players perceive another player using them. In one survey and two experimental scenario-studies with active gamers as participants (total N = 532), we found evidence supporting the idea that a player using <b>microtransactions</b> will be judged more negatively. More specifically, we find that gamers dislike it more when <b>microtransactions</b> allow the buying of functional benefits (that provide an in-game advantage) than when they are merely ornamental, and players who buy these functional benefits are respected less. In Studies 2 and 3 we found that players who use <b>microtransactions</b> are perceived as having a lower skill and status. This happens both when the microtransaction-using player is an enemy who bought a competitive advantage, as well as in games where one cooperates with the microtransaction-using player and the advantage is thus effectively shared. The findings have important practical implications for game-design. They indicate how micro-transactions can be implemented so that they have fewer negative social consequences, demonstrate the value of social psychological theories in predicting online behavior, and provide several avenues for further theoretical exploration.

2500|$|The game also {{includes}} a <b>microtransaction</b> system. Players can buy [...] "Source Crystals" [...] using real-world money to purchase cosmetic adjustments for fighters, such as premier skins and shaders, instead of waiting to obtain them through normal play. Source Crystals {{can also be used}} to buy [...] "Transform Gear". Transform Gear lets players apply the visuals of one piece of gear to another, allowing them to match their preferred stat modifiers with their preferred costume pieces. Lastly, once players have reached Level 20 with at least one character, Source Crystals can be used to level up other characters to their maximum levels. NetherRealm representatives clarified that any purchases made with Source Crystals are strictly cosmetic and offer no gameplay advantages.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 February 2012, an in-game feature was {{introduced}} called the [...] "Squeal of Fortune" [...] that allowed players to win {{items on a}} daily basis by spinning the wheel. On 2 April 2012, it became possible for players to spend real-world currency in exchange for additional spins, introducing a form of <b>microtransaction</b> to the game. Jagex CEO Mark Gerhard had previously described microtransactions as [...] "a stealth tax", and the update provoked complaints from players who believed they had been [...] "betrayed" [...] by the change. In July 2012, Jagex released Solomon's General Store, making it possible to spend real currency in exchange for [...] "RuneCoins" [...] that could be spent on cosmetic rewards in the game. On 29 August 2012, Gerhard released a response to this controversy, describing these microtransactions as [...] " [...] a significant role in ensuring that we can continue to support, develop and grow the game for many more years to come." [...] He states that while these decisions are [...] "not necessarily popular", they are made with the future of RuneScape in mind. On 4 February 2014, the Squeal of Fortune was replaced with Treasure Hunter. Rather than spinning a wheel for prizes, players are given keys which are used to open a chest of their choosing. On 26 March 2014, Gerhard reiterated his stance on microtransactions and their importance in updating RuneScape, and announced a partnership with Supersonic ads, allowing players to earn RuneCoins by watching advertisements or sampling products.|$|E

5000|$|Free-to-play {{games that}} include a <b>microtransaction</b> model are {{sometimes}} referred to as [...] "freemium". [...] "Pay-to-win" [...] is sometimes used as a derogatory term to refer to games where paying for in-game items can give the player an advantage over other players, particularly if the items cannot be obtained by free means. The objective with a free-to-play <b>microtransaction</b> model is to get more players into the game and provide desirable items or features that players can purchase if they are interested in them - it is hoped that in the long term the profits from a <b>microtransaction</b> system will outweigh the profits from a one-time-purchase game.|$|E
50|$|Items and {{features}} available by <b>microtransaction</b> {{can range from}} cosmetic (such as decorative character attire) to functional (such as weapons and items).

Players can obtain more Silver via <b>microtransactions.</b> One of the first emotes was the Enthusiastic Dance, inspired by the Carlton Dance from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Bungie stressed that these emotes are completely optional and the <b>microtransactions</b> are an effort to [...] "bolster the service provided by our live team for another full year". On December 15, 2015, boosting packs became available as <b>microtransactions.</b> The pack automatically boosts one character to level 25, and also features a temporary stat boost and [...] "Telemetry" [...] items to assist in further leveling.|$|R

50|$|In-game <b>microtransactions</b> {{are when}} {{aspects of a}} game’s {{contents}} can be purchased by players {{with the goal of}} enhancing their experience with the game. These can range from new forms of playable content, in-game currencies, cosmetic options, and otherwise unavailable or restricted gameplay advantages. Traditionally, these purchases tend to be relatively inexpensive but numerous in variety. <b>Microtransactions</b> are often common in social and mobile games where potential customers may be hesitant to purchase a full game, but more at ease with smaller, yet more numerous payments.|$|R
