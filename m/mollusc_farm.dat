In this area, fish and <b>molluscs</b> <b>farming</b> as well as riverine run-off contribute to the characterization of the marine benthic ecosystem resulting in enrichment of organic matter content. The qualitative and quantitative foraminiferal analyses on the surface samples revealed different degree of eutrophic conditions. Five foraminiferal assemblages were recognized with a bathymetric distribution parallel to the coast. The presence of eutrophic foraminifera assemblages at about - 20 m water depth in the restored area, between Punta dello Stendardo and Torre del Fico showed that the anthropogenicc activities associated with this semi-enclosed geomorphological feature caused the increase of bottom stress conditions. Here, the Garigliano river influence is weaker than {{in the rest of}} the studied section of the Gulf where the foraminiferal distribution pattern occurred in the most important river mouth of Italian coast. In particular, by proximity to the river mouth, the foraminiferal distribution seems to be controlled mainly by salinity but at higher depth (20 - 50 m) it is more influenced by organic matter accumulation, low oxygen conditions and dominance of infaunal species such as B. elongata, N. turgida and V. bradyana...|$|R

In addition, Manila clams are collected illegally in different areas of the Venice lagoon located close to a highly polluted industrial zone. Arsenic content and speciation were determined in transplanted clams placed in nylon nets in the studied sites at two different tidal heights, and grown from spring 2003 to winter 2005, when they reached the commercial size. Within this growth period, clam samples were collected three times, together with bottom sediments and suspended particulate matter (SPM). The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the relationship between arsenic environmental concentrations and bioaccumulation in clams, and to achieve a better evaluation of the possible risk posed to the human population exposed to arsenic through clam consumption, by quantifying the individual levels of the various arsenic compounds in clam tissues. The results seem to indicate different patterns of arsenic accumulation by clams in relation to contamination in sediments and SPM in the two lagoons, with a higher bioaccumulation at Marano (up to about 60 mg/kg d. w.), despite the lower arsenic levels found in the abiotic matrices, whereas for the Venice lagoon sites As concentrations were below 30 mg/kg d. w. In addition, the relative abundance of the various arsenic compounds in clams collected in the different sampling sites allowed to advance some hypotheses about arsenic uptake and metabolism in this bivalve filter-feeder. A major role seems to be played by the physiological status of clams and by accumulation through the diet, since the two lagoons present differences in terms of environmental and contamination conditions, and of phytoplancton availability...|$|R
40|$|Seasonal {{changes of}} sperm quality which can affect sperm {{biological}} parameters throughout the breeding period, have been little studied in mollusc species. Controlling gamete quality would aid {{the management of}} gametes in hatcheries {{and the development of}} selection programs. The aim {{of the present study was}} to describe the changes in sperm quality of wild Pacific oysters through the spawning season by comparing sperm parameters at the beginning (May), middle (July) and end (October) of this period using a panel of bio-descriptors. These parameters were studied over the 2014 breeding season based on shed sperm collected after serotonin injection of wild breeders. A significantly higher percentage of motile sperm was observed at the end of the spawning season (+ 78 % relative to the value observed at the beginning) althought a lower total number of spermatozoa was collected (− 59 %). The mean condition index of oysters, however, was no different between the three sampling dates. For intratesticular sperm, the increase of the percentage of motile sperm and Velocity of the Average Path (VAP) in relation to time post activation was not significantly different among sperm sampling periods, suggesting that the kinetic of the sperm maturation process was similar. Furthermore, the mean VAP observed on shed sperm did not change through the spawning season. The sub-continuous gametogenesis of Pacific oyster can help to explain why only limited consequences of sperm ageing are observed in this species. Furthermore, the effects of sperm ageing may depend on the annual reproductive pattern of Pacific oyster.

Brown of the Medical Research Council (London) kindly drew my {{attention to the fact that}} judging from the figures the described specimens certainly do not belong to this species. Dr. Brown generously agreed to examine the material, which unfortunately only consisted of shells. His conclusion is that these represent an imported alien species of the American planorbid genus Helisoma Swainson, 1840. This genus is rich in species which are very difficult to tell apart, particularly if their genital anatomy and geographical origin are unknown. Tropical aquarium fanciers and fish breeders have spread some freshwater snails outside their countries of origin and thus the genus Helisoma is also known from South Africa (Brown, 1967 : 483). However, Dr. Brown writes: "Speaking from memory, my Helisoma from Natal were different to yours, in that the spire was generally far less elevated. I suppose that there may have been a number of introductions from separate sources.

40|$|It {{has been}} known for some time that food can {{transmit}} pathogens of viral and bacterial nature to humans resulting in various diseases that, despite progress in the field of prevention, are still a major concern in the public health sector. Among the main food, source of infection and/or intoxication, bivalve molluscs are included; being filter organisms, they are subject to phenomena of bioaccumulation of substances present in the environment where they live, thus concentrating on their body nutrients and even viruses and bacteria became therefore an important source of health risk. For this reason, their consumption, widespread in Italy, represents one of the major causes of Norovirus infection in our country. European Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2073 / 2005 base its microbiological suitability evaluation of bivalve molluscs on the determination of bacteriological parameters (Salmonella spp. and E. coli).

40|$|Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations {{predicts that}} {{worldwide}} harvest output of aquatic products will be stagnant or decreased whereas {{the consumption of}} aquatic products will be increased {{at the speed of}} 1. 0 % to 2. 9 %. The increase of aquatic product output will mainly be attributed to the development of aquaculture. For a developing country, especially for a country with a large population and fast developing pace as China, aquaculture in the 21 st century will not only face favorable developing opportunities but severe challenges as well. 1. A brief introduction to the development of Chinese aquaculture. China has a very long history in aquaculture. Chinese aquaculture industry has witnessed the growth rates of more than 10 percent every year. Since 1989, China's aquatic product output has been in the first place of the world. At present, it accounts for 40 % of the world's aquatic product output, among which the aquaculture output accounts for 70 % of that of the world. China thus becomes the only fishery country that aquaculture output exceeds fishing yield, with 9 billion US dollars of export volume which accounts for 30 % of the total export volume of agricultural products. Export of aquatic products has enhanced China's international competitiveness in the field of fishery, thus promoted the development of domestic aquaculture and aquatic processing. In 2006, the freshwater aquaculture area was 60, 200 hectares and the aquaculture output was 19. 5 million tons which accounted for 97 % of the total output of cultured fishes. Aquaculture is a vibrant industry in China, Chinese aquaculture producers are rapidly upgrading their technology to produce species such as black carps, grass carps, silver carps, bighead carps, tilapia, catfish, eel, shrimp, abalone, sea bass, turbot, sea bream, red drum, crab, flounder, trout, mussels, salmon and more. 2. A major challenge for Chinese aquaculture. China suffers from environmental pollution and a shortage of freshwater resources. The problems of shortage of water resources and water quality-induced water shortage become more and more prominent in China. The current fishery pattern costs a great deal of resources and we need to shift the fishery pattern to the resource saving and environmentally friendly orientation. This is not only a scientific issue but also a social issue. However, the current scientific development of fishery in China does not meet the transformation of fishery growth modes. 3. Aquaculture should be resource saving and environmentally friendly. How to make aquaculture be shifted to the resource saving and environmentally friendly orientation? Simply speaking, in order to realize the goal of shifting to the resource saving and environmentally friendly orientation, sustainable aquaculture mode will become the direction of China's aquaculture. Sustainable aquaculture must consider the ecological, social, and economic aspects of development. Recently, governments and industry have realized that the focus of aquaculture must evolve into the development of an industry that is both environmentally and socially sustainable in the long term. Positive changes are being made with this growing interest and awareness of improving the sustainability of aquaculture. With the expected expansion of aquaculture in the coming years it will be vital that sustainable practices be implemented and further developed to avoid environmental and social problems. There are a number of alternative ways forward in the development of aquaculture, which can offer more sustainable solutions. In some cases these methods have been around for centuries, but they have rarely been adopted in the modern aquaculture industry, and in other cases they are innovative practices that can be explored by aquaculture proponents. Alternatives include ecological aquaculture, organic aquaculture, polyculture, <b>mollusc</b> <b>farming,</b> and closed and low discharge systems. These alternative practices have been successfully implemented in different areas of the world; however, they must be examined for their application on a wider scale. Concerns for water conservation and reduced waste discharges have prompted the increased use of closed recirculating aquaculture systems. The systems are made up of three basic components: culture tank, settling tank, and biological filter. Recirculating systems have less of an impact upon the environment because of their closed nature - wastes and uneaten feed are not simply released into the ambient environment in the manner that they are with netpens and exotic species and diseases are not introduced into the environment. In recirculating systems, wastes are filtered out of the culture system and disposed of in a responsible manner. Recirculating systems can be built just about anywhere, including in urban settings where they can use existing structures and be placed close to markets, thereby reducing transportation costs. Recirculating systems can be used to grow a wide variety of fish species year-round in controlled environments. Species commonly grown in recirculating systems include hybrid striped bass and tilapia. Additionally, much research has been dedicated to developing recirculating systems for marine species of fish and this technology holds much promise. Ecological aquaculture has been defined as "an alternative model of aquaculture research and development that brings the technical aspects of ecological principles and ecosystems thinking to aquaculture". Ecological aquaculture focuses on the development of farming systems that preserve the environments in which they are situated and enhances the quality of these environments {{while at the same time}} maintaining a productive culture system. All aspects of the operation are interconnected in order to minimize negative impacts on the community, both natural and social. Ecological aquaculture can also be incorporated into sustainable fisheries management and coastal zone management. In 2007, Shanghai has launched the construction of standard ecological aquaculture bases, as a means to transform its traditional aquaculture model. The base will form an ecological system, with 20 ponds with distinct functions such as seedling raising, prawn-farming, a fish pond and artificial wetland. A 1200 hektares ecological aquaculture area will be completed during the 11 th five-year-plan period. Shanghai will explore a low-cost and highly efficient way to popularize the application of aquaculture model. 国連FAOによると，最近，水産物の消費量は増加する一方で，漁獲量は現状維持あるいは減少傾向を，養殖生産物は増加傾向を示している。発展途上国，とりわけ人口増加と産業発展の著しい中国では， 21 世紀に水産養殖の著しい発展が望まれる。中国における水産養殖は，歴史が古く，最近では年 10 ％以上の成長率を示しており，その生産量は 1989 年以降世界最大である。今日，世界に占める中国の割合は漁獲量で 40 ％，養殖生産量で 70 ％に達する。中国は水産国であり，養殖生産量は漁獲量を超え，その 30 ％にあたる 9000 億円を輸出している。淡水養殖は， 2006 年において面積 60, 200 ヘクタール，生産量 1950 万トン（全体の 97 ％）に及び，その養殖技術は著しく向上している。また一方では，中国は環境汚染と水資源不足に悩んでいる。最近の漁業パターンは膨大な資源を消費するため，資源保護と環境保護にシフトすることが，科学的にもまた社会課題としても重要である。しかし，最近の水産科学の発展は，必ずしも水産業の育成に活かされていない。今後，資源節約型で環境に優しい持続可能な水産養殖が重要であり，生態学的，社会的，かつ経済学的視点から発展させる必要がある。代替養殖として，生態学的養殖，有機養殖，多種養殖，貝養殖，閉鎖低排水型システムなどがあげられる。これらは，広大な規模で実証されることにより世界へ広めることが可能である。生態学的養殖は，「生態学的原理と生態系を考えた養殖の研究と発展の代替モデル」と定義できる。生態学的養殖は，生産量の増加と同時に環境の改善をも図ることに焦点を当てており，持続可能な資源管理と沿岸区域管理も含んでいる。上海は， 2007 年に，標準的な生態学的養殖基地を開始した。その基地は種苗生産，エビ養殖，養殖池や人工湿地帯などのように異なる機能からなる 20 の池をもつ生態学的システムからなる。第 11 期 5 カ年計画で 1200 ヘクタールの生態学的養殖域が完成した。上海は，水産養殖モデルの適用を広めるために，さらに低コストで高効率な手法を開発するだろう。Invited Lecture...|$|R
40|$|The toxic dinoflagellate Protoceratium reticulatum (Clapare`de &Lachmann) Buetschli is recurrently {{present in}} the Adriatic sea. It is the {{producing}} organism of yessotoxin (YTX) {{and some of its}} analogues and thus its presence in seawater often results in shellfish farm closure for long periods. However, molluscs become highly toxic also at the presence of low cell concentrations, due to the high YTX content present in most algal strains. As no data were available on the environmental conditions favouring growth and YTX production by Adriatic P. reticulatum strains, in the present work, we investigated the effect of nutrient limitation, salinity and temperature on growth and YTX content in P. reticulatum cultures. Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) analyses were carried out to determine YTX production as well as the difference between the YTX amount retained in cells and that released in growth medium, in order to relate cell content to excretion mechanisms. The toxin content was determined in cells collected at the stationary phase, since both toxin production and release were found to be higher in this growth stage than in the exponential phase. As for nutrient-effect, a severe P-limitation strongly affected cell growth and favoured toxin accumulation, as consequences of both impaired cell division and lower toxin release. N-limited cultures, on the contrary, had a toxin content similar to controls and the highest percentage of release. P. reticulatum was confirmed to be tolerant towards salinity changes as it could grow at salinity values in the range of 22 – 42. The highest YTX production was observed at intermediate salinity values (32) whereas toxin release, expressed as percentage of the total amount produced, decreased as salinity increased. P. reticulatum growth was impaired in cultures kept at 26 8 C in respect to those grown at 16 and 20 8 C. YTX release decreased as temperature increased;however, cells kept at 26 8 C displayed a very high YTX content. The environmental implications of these physiological behaviours highlight that <b>farmed</b> <b>molluscs</b> can become less toxic in colder waters at lower salinity values...|$|R
40|$|The {{north-western}} {{coasts of}} the Adriatic sea {{have long been}} subjected to recurring cases of harmful algae blooms and concomitant mussel contamination. In 1995, yessotoxins (YTXs) were detected {{for the first time}} in Adriatic mussels and their presence was subsequently linked to the presence of Protoceratium reticulatumand occasionally Lingulodiniumpolyedrum in seawater. Since then, <b>farmed</b> <b>molluscs</b> are yearly found to contain YTXs for long periods with a severe impact on aquaculture activities. In 2004, unusually high amounts of homoYTXs were detected in mussels. In this period, a careful look at the phytoplankton composition highlighted that P. reticulatum and L. polyedrum were nearly absent in seawater whereas the dinoflagellate Gonyaulax spinifera was present at high densities. G. spinifera has been recently associated with YTX production in New Zealand. The present work was performed in order to ascertain whether Adriatic G. spinifera was a toxic species. Determination of the toxin content of natural samples (mussels and net haul plankton samples) as well as monitoring of the dinoflagellate species present in seawaters allowed us to correlate the presence of G. spinifera to that of homoYTX in mussels. Cultures of G. spinifera were set up which gave us the opportunity to investigate toxin content and profile of the dinoflagellate, for the first time, by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) and to perform a molecular characterization of the species through rDNA sequencing. Two G. spinifera isolates, sampled in different years, were analyzed and resulted to be different in both toxin content and gene sequence: the isolate sampled in 2005 produced only low levels of YTX (5. 4 pg cell 1) while that sampled in 2006 contained higher toxin amounts, namely 33. 4 pg cell 1 of homoYTX and 3. 6 pg cell 1 of YTX; the two isolates also differed in 111 and 176 nucleotide positions, respectively, in the SSU and partial LSU rDNA genes. Comparing similar sequences of G. spinifera strains contained in GenBank, divergences among the Adriatic strains and strains of different geographical origin emerged; on the contrary, a good similarity was evidenced (1. 3 %) between the Adriatic isolate sampled in 2006 and two New Zealand strains; the similarity was confirmed also by the presence in all strains of YTXs, although the New Zealand strains were analyzed by ELISA which could not distinguish among the different YTX analogues. Due to an originally confusing description of the species and to the availability of very low number of deposited sequences the doubt arises whether the studied G. spinifera strains belong to the same species. However, although the taxonomy of the species complex G. spinifera remains largely unresolved, this study allowed to unambiguously link the presence of G. spinifera to recurring mussel toxicity episode...|$|R
40|$|The {{pearl oyster}} {{industry}} is a growing multibillion dollar sector of <b>mollusc</b> aquaculture. Pearl <b>farming</b> occurs throughout Australasia, the Middle East and South America. Few species of molluscs possess the ability to produce pearls of gem quality. The South Sea pearl oyster is one of them. Pearl production in the wild is an unpredictable and uncontrolled event which human intervention, through pearl culture, has progressively overcome by improving culture practices. Farming mother-of-pearls shares commonalties with edible mollusc aquaculture. However, the endproduct, pearl production, is unique to this sector. In aquatic production, heal issues are of utmost importance; pearl production is based entirely upon health. The pearl itself {{is a product of}} the oyster’s immune defences as a response to soft-tissue irritation. Exploited stocks receive frequent handling stresses which often predispose farmed animals to infection and diseases. Therefore, the importance of health management for pearl oysters is paramount. Today, most disease problems are caused by opportunistic pathogens taking advantage of oysters weakened by the stress of handling, including pearl surgery and sub-optimal growing conditions. Except for the mass mortalities experienced in Japan, the pearl oyster industry have not yet faced the types of epizootics which has impacted mollusc culture elsewhere in the world. Development of the industry will, inevitably, lead to increased risk of disease introduction, spread or emergence. Against such an unwanted future, health management is the critical defence line. The objectives of this technical paper are to: (i) review pearl oyster mortalities and disease problems in order to help design programmes aimed at reducing the risks from diseases; and (ii) provide technical guidance to pearl oyster farmers and the industry on management of pearl oyster health so that sector development will be sustainable not only in providing huge employment to communities where pearl farms are located but also contributing to maintain environmental integrity. Pearl oyster farming can serve as environmental sentinels recognizing the fact that pearl oysters thrive only in pristine environment. This publication contains three parts. Part 1 consists of pearl oyster health — the current interest in it and an overview of the cultured marine pearl industry. Pan 2 on pearl oyster health management consists of seven sections, namely: (a) introduction; (b) general information on husbandry and handling, hatchery production, introductions and transfers; (c) disease diagnostic protocols dealing with field collections of samples, gross external examination, gross internal examination and laboratory protocols; (d) health zonation; (e) disease outbreak protocols; (f) national strategies on aquatic animal health; and (g) references. Certain countries in the pearl oyster producing regions have acquired a great deal of experience in health management of cultured species. Experiences from Australia, the Cook Islands, Japan, the French Polynesia, the Philippines, China, the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea are included in Part 3 which also contains a general review of pearl oyster mortalities and disease problems.
