Its life cycle is comprised of two different phases, one is the growth and development phase {{and the other is}} diapause phase which takes place at the adult stage. In this study the effects of juvenile hormone analogue Pyriproxyfen, ecdysone analogue <b>methoxyfenozide</b> and a mixture of Pyriproxyfen plus <b>methoxyfenozide</b> on diapause termination of < 24 -h-old-, 45 day old-, and 90 day old adult Sunn pests were examined using topical application. Pyriproxyfen and a mixture of Pyriproxyfen plus <b>methoxyfenozide</b> induced the growth of the female reproductive organ whilst <b>methoxyfenozide</b> had no effect on adult diapause termination. Also, Pyriproxyfen failed to induce egg deposition in sexually immature adults of Sunn pest.

40|$|The {{tobacco budworm}} Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) {{is one of}} the major insect pests of many {{economically}} important crops and vegetables. It attacks more than 112 cultivated plants species including cotton, maize, tobacco, groundnut, summer legumes and many vegetables. It has developed high resistance against all type of insecticides including conventional and new chemistry insecticides. Keeping in view the importance of this pest, experiments were conducted to find out mechanism of resistance, cross resistance, stability and fitness cost of resistance of S. litura against <b>methoxyfenozide</b> and spinosad. To investigate the mechanism, cross resistance and stability of S. litura to <b>methoxyfenozide,</b> a field collected population of S. litura selected with <b>methoxyfenozide</b> for thirteen consecutive generations resulted in the development of 83. 24 and 2358. 6 -fold resistance to <b>methoxyfenozide</b> as compared to parental field population and susceptible laboratory population, respectively. The outcomes of synergism studies revealed <b>methoxyfenozide</b> resistance in S. litura to be monooxygenases (MO) mediated with high synergistic ratio (4. 83) with piperonyl butoxide (PBO), while S, S, S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate (DEF) showed no synergism with <b>methoxyfenozide</b> (SR= 1). This <b>methoxyfenozide</b> resistant strain showed a high cross resistance to deltamethrin (28. 82), abamectin (12. 87) and little to emamectin benzoate (2. 36), however no cross resistance of <b>methoxyfenozide</b> and other tested insecticides was recorded. The results depicted the <b>methoxyfenozide</b> resistance in S. litura to be unstable with high reversion rate which decreased from 2358. 6 to 163. 9 -fold (as compared to the susceptible strain) when reared for five generations without any insecticidal exposure. The present research supports the significance of MO-mediated metabolism in resistance to <b>methoxyfenozide,</b> which demands some tactics to tackle this problem. The resistance against <b>methoxyfenozide</b> in S. litura can be overcome by switching off its use for few generations or insecticides rotation having different mode of action. Similarly in order to investigate the mechanism of resistance, cross resistance and stability of spinosad resistance to S. litura, a field collected population of S. litura was selected with spinosad for eleven generations under controlled laboratory conditions. The resistance to spinosad in S. litura increased 3921 -fold (after eleven generations of selection with spinosad) as compared to a susceptible population of S. litura. No cross resistance between spinosad and emamectin benzoate, <b>methoxyfenozide,</b> fipronil, indoxacarb, profenofos, lufenuron or deltamethrin was found in the spinosad selected population of S. litura. To find the possible mechanism of spinosad resistance in S. litura two synergists, piperonyl butoxide (PBO), S, S, S tributyl phosphorotrithioate (DEF) were tested on the susceptible and resistant strains and on the un-selected field population. The values of the synergist ratios of PBO and DEF were 2. 33 and 1. 06 for the spinosad selected strain, 1. 36 and 1. 06 for the un-selected field population and 1. 14 and 1. 00 for the susceptible strain, respectively. As high PBO ratio indicates the role of microsomal O-demethylase in causing spinosad resistance in S. litura. The spinosad resistant and field populations of S. litura were reared without any selection pressure from the 12 th to the 16 th generation (G 12 -G 16). The spinosad resistance decreased from 3921 to 678 -fold in the spinosad resistant population and from 31. 1 to 15. 1 -fold in the un-selected population of S. litura as compared to the susceptible strain. Spinosad resistance in S. litura has a high reversion rate (0. 15) which indicates that spinosad resistance in S. litura is unstable and can be easily managed by switching off the selection pressure for a few generations or alternating with insecticides having different modes of action. To find out the fitness cost and sub lethal effects of <b>methoxyfenozide</b> to S. litura, two experiments were designed using the susceptible, field and <b>methoxyfenozide</b> resistant populations of S. litura. The first experiment was conducted to find out the fitness cost of <b>methoxyfenozide</b> resistance in a methoxyfenozide-resistant strain of S. litura for which a field collected population of S. litura was selected with <b>methoxyfenozide</b> for thirteen consecutive generations which resulted in the development of 83. 0 and 2359 -fold resistance to <b>methoxyfenozide</b> as compared to the field and susceptible population of S. litura and showed a fitness cost of 0. 17 as compared to the susceptible strain of S. litura. In the second experiment this susceptible strain was treated with <b>methoxyfenozide</b> by incorporating different concentration levels of <b>methoxyfenozide</b> i. e. LC 30, LC 20 and LC 10 into its artificial diet and feeding the 2 nd instar larvae on this treated diet for three days. The effects of different concentrations of <b>methoxyfenozide</b> on the biological parameters of S. litura were determined. It was observed that higher concentrations of <b>methoxyfenozide</b> significantly prolonged the development period of larvae and pupae of S. litura as compared to the untreated control population.

40|$|Susceptibility to tebufenozide and <b>methoxyfenozide</b> of beet {{armyworm}} (Spodoptera exigua) {{from the southern}} United States and Thailand was determined through exposure of first and third instar larvae to dipped cotton leaves. LC 50 estimates of first instar larvae ranged from 0. 377 to 32. 7 micrograms of tebufenozide per milliliter and 0. 034 to 11. 5 micrograms of <b>methoxyfenozide</b> per milliliter. LC 50 estimates of third instar larvae ranged from 4. 37 to 715 micrograms of tebufenozide per milliliter and 0. 393 to 47. 4 micrograms of <b>methoxyfenozide</b> per milliliter. These estimates translated into 87 -fold and 164 -fold decreases in susceptibility to tebufenozide and 338 -fold and 121 -fold decreases in susceptibility to <b>methoxyfenozide</b> of first and third instar larvae from a Thailand strain {{when compared to the}} most susceptible of eight United States populations evaluated. Among the United States field populations evaluated, a collection from Belle Glade, Florida was the most susceptible and one taken near Parker, Arizona was the least susceptible. Selection of the Thailand population with tebufenozide or <b>methoxyfenozide</b> resulted in significant reductions in susceptibility to both analogs, indicating a common mechanism of resistance.

40|$|A {{greenhouse}} {{study was}} conducted to investigate the persistence of <b>methoxyfenozide</b> in pepper (Capsicum annuumL.) foliage. An aqueous suspension of <b>methoxyfenozide</b> was sprayed on pepper plants at concentrations of 72 and 144 mg of active ingredient (a. i.) /L. Foliage was collected at different intervals of time (0, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 days) after the treatment, and the <b>methoxyfenozide</b> residue was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The foliage was also used in bioassays to determine the residual toxicity on and the consumption rate of the third-instar larvae of the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). The <b>methoxyfenozide</b> concentrations observed after 50 days had decreased to 19 and 69 g/g per sample, corresponding to a loss of 61 % and 28 % from the application concentrations of 72 and 144 mg a. i. /L, respectively. When fitting a first-order kinetics degradation model, the half-life (DT 50) of this compound was 76 days. Both application concentrations of <b>methoxyfenozide</b> caused a high mortality rate (97 %) when the larvae were fed the pepper foliage collected at all of the time intervals. Lastly, at all of the time points, the consumption rate by the larvae was reduced to between 57 % and 92 % for both concentrations that were bioassayed. Our results indicate that, under the present greenhouse conditions, the degradation of <b>methoxyfenozide</b> was slower than that reported by other authors and that its residues were highly toxic to S. exigua larvae.

40|$|The lethal and {{sublethal}} {{effects of}} the ecdysone agonist <b>methoxyfenozide</b> on the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith), were investigated by feeding a methoxyfenozide-treated diet to fifth instars until pupation in doses corresponding to the LC 10 and LC 25 for the compound. Larval mortality reached 8 % and 26 % in the low and high concentration groups, respectively, on the seventh day of the experiment. A progressive larval mortality of 12 % for the LC 10 and 60 % for the LC 25 was observed before pupation. Treated larvae exhibited lower pupal weights, higher pupal mortality, presence of deformed pupae, and more deformed adults than untreated larvae. The incorporation of <b>methoxyfenozide</b> into the diet {{had a significant effect}} on the timing of larval development. The development period for males and females was about seven days longer than the controls for both concentrations tested. In contrast, the compound affected neither pupae nor adult longevity.

On the bases of pest progeny development and percent damage, the wheat genotypes were most susceptible as compared to rice and maize. Results regarding the larval mortality revealed that the highest mortality was caused by flufenoxuron. Adult suppression was highest due to the flufenoxuron and lowest in triflumeron. Highest ovicidal action was exerted by pyriproxyfen where only 32. 83 % hatching was recorded in T. castaneum eggs followed by lufenuron at 10 ppm while <b>methoxyfenozide</b> was least effective. Similarly, in T. granarium, the hatching suppression was highest (38. 83 % hatching) due to pyriproxyfen treatment and was lowest in <b>methoxyfenozide</b> treatment. Growth rate was highly effected by pyriproxyfen and least effected by <b>methoxyfenozide</b> against both insects. The highest adult mortality was 20. 78 and 20. 23 % due to the application of triflumeron and flufenoxuron, respectively and was lowest (6. 63 %) where tebufenozide was applied against T. granarium. In T. castaneum the highest adult mortality (37. 64 %) and lowest (6. 84 %) were due to exposure of triflumeron and tebufenozide, respectively. Significant reduction in fecundity and fertility of both inesects was also recorded due to the adult exposure to IGRs treated diet. Fecundity was significant reduced in tebufenozide treatment application followed by <b>methoxyfenozide</b> while buprofezin and pyriproxyfen have little effect on T. castaneum and T. granarium. Our results regarding the effect on fertility of adults exposed to IGRs treated diet indicated that pyriproxyfen was the most effective in suppressing the egg hatching and tebufenozide was the least effective against both insects. Progeny production was minimum in pyriproxyfen and highest in tebufenozide against both targeted insects. Bioactivities of all the tested IGRs {{were found to be}} dose and exposure period dependent.

Selected pesticides are effective against different key pests present in horticultural crop areas and were always applied at the maximum field recommended concentration in Spain if registered, or at the concentration recommended by the supplier. Out of the tested pesticides, spiromesifen, flonicamid, flubendiamide, sulfoxaflor, metaflumizone, <b>methoxyfenozide</b> and spirotetramat were harmless to adults of the predatory mite (IOBC toxicity class 1). The rest of pesticides exhibited some negative effects: emamectin was slightly harmful (IOBC 2), deltamethrin moderately harmful (IOBC 3) and spinosad and abamectin harmful (IOBC 4). Further testing under more realistic conditions is needed for those pesticides having some harmful effect on the mite prior deciding their joint use or not.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of insecticides in controlling Helicoverpa spp., predominantly H. armigera (Hubner), on capsicum and zucchini was tested in small plot trials. Indoxacarb, <b>methoxyfenozide,</b> spinosad, emamectin benzoate and novaluron provided control, {{as measured by}} the percentage of damaged fruit, equal to or better than standard treatments of methomyl or methomyl alternated with methamidophos on capsicum. The Helicoverpa nucleopolyhedrovirus gave control equivalent to the standard treatment, as did Bacillus thuringiensis aizawai, but B. thuringiensis kurstaki was ineffective. Helicoverpa armigera larvae were present in zucchini flowers but did little damage to the fruit. None of the insecticides significantly reduced the percentage of damaged zucchini fruit compared with the untreated control. Bifenthrin, spinosad, emamectin benzoate and <b>methoxyfenozide</b> were effective in controlling larvae in flowers, while methomyl, B. thuringiensis aizawai, B. thuringiensis kurstaki and novaluron were not effective. Data indicated that all the insecticides effectively controlled larvae of Diaphania indica (Saunders), cucumber moth, in the zucchini flowers. There has been a limited range of insecticides available to manage Helicoverpa spp. in these vegetable crops, but these trials demonstrate the effectiveness of a number of newer insecticides that could be used and that would be compatible with integrated pest management programs in the crops...|$|E
40|$|Although dibenzoylhydrazine-type non-steroidal {{ecdysone}} agonists such as <b>methoxyfenozide</b> (RH- 2485) have {{an excellent}} performance record, the emergence of resistance could severely compromise the efficacy of these compounds in integrated pest management programs. To investigate possible mechanisms of resistance, cell lines derived from the polyphagous noctuid pest Spodoptera exigua (Se 4 cells) were selected for continuous growth {{in the presence of}} high concentrations of 20 -hydroxyecdysone (20 E) or <b>methoxyfenozide.</b> Here we describe an analysis of ecdysteroid receptor signaling in the ecdysteroid-resistant Se 4 cell lines. In contrast to other ecdysteroid-resistant cell lines described in literature, our data support the existence of a normal functioning ecdysteroid receptor complex in the resistant Se 4 cell lines: (1) using a recombinant BmNPV baculovirus as a transduction tool, activation of an ecdysone-responsive luciferase cassette was demonstrated; (2) the early gene HR 3 is constitutively expressed in the resistant cell lines that are grown in the presence of 20 E or <b>methoxyfenozide.</b> Quantitative RT-PCR experiments indicated that expression levels of SeEcR mRNA were comparable among sensitive and resistant cell lines. Sequencing of PCR fragments also revealed the presence of SeEcR mRNA with a wild-type ligand-binding domain in resistant cells. Finally, a possible role for the gene FTZ-F 1, whose expression correlates with the absence of circulating ecdysteroids during insect development, in the resistance mechanism was investigated. However, it was observed that FTZ-F 1, in contrast to what is observed during insect development, is constitutively expressed in Se 4 cells and that its expression is not regulated by the addition of ecdysteroid. It is proposed that the resistance mechanism in Se 4 cells resides at the coupling between the conserved hierarchical cascade of early and early-late gene expression and the differentiation program in the Se 4 cell line. The use of insect cell lines for the investigation of resistance against dibenzoylhydrazine ecdysone agonists and their relevance for uncovering resistance mechanisms in insects during pest control programs is discussed. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Control of {{the most}} {{relevant}} phytophagous of {{apple and pear trees}} in Emilia-Romagna (Northern Italy) is achieved by insecticides but it is improved also by defence techniques allowing protection of useful insects. It is therefore relevant to understand in detail the effects {{of the most}} common insecticides employed in integrated defence of the two above mentioned cultures on the main auxiliary insects, both predators and parasitoids. With this aim we performed open field tests to evaluate the acute toxicity (48 hours after the treatment), according to the method suggested by IOBC Working Group &ldquo;Integrated Protection in Orchards&rdquo; to test three recently developed active ingredient: Spinosad, Indoxacarb and <b>Methoxyfenozide.</b> These three principles were compared to Azinphos methyl, presently {{one of the most widely}} employed insecticides with a broad action spectrum. Spinosad is a natural insecticide compound, whose active principle is a toxin produced by Saccharopolispora spinosa, Indoxacarb and <b>Methoxyfenozide</b> are synthetic molecules, respectively belonging to the family of oxadiazines and moult accelerators, while Azinphos methyl is an organophosphate compound. The results show that Azinphos methyl is characterized by a lower selectivity towards generic Coccinellidae, while mortality towards Antochoris nemoralis is rather limited for all active principles tested, on the contrary to what observed for parasitoid Hymenoptera...|$|E
40|$|Development {{of insect}} {{resistance}} to insecticide {{has been the}} major driving force {{for the development of}} new insecticides. Awareness and demand from public for more environmentally friendly insecticides have contributed in shifting the trend from using broad spectrum to selective insecticides. As a result, scientists have looked for new target sites beyond the nervous system. Insect growth regulators (IGRs) are more selective insecticides than conventional insecticides, and ecdysone agonists are the newest IGRs being commercialized, e. g. tebufenozide, <b>methoxyfenozide,</b> and halofenozide. Ecdysone agonists bind to the ecdysteroid receptors, and they act similarly to the molting hormone 20 -hydroxyecdysone. The binding provides larvae or nymphs with a signal to enter a premature and lethal molting cycle. In addition, the ecdysone agonists cause a {{reduction in the number of}} eggs laid by female insects. The ecdysone agonists are being developed as selective biorational insecticides. Tebufenozide and <b>methoxyfenozide</b> are used to control lepidopteran insect pests, whereas halofenozide is being used to control coleopteran insect pests. Their selectivity is due to differences in the binding affinity between these compounds to the receptors in insects from different orders. The selectivity of these compounds makes them candidates to be used in combinations with other control strategies to develop integrated pest management programs in agricultural ecosystems. Key words: new insecticides, selectivity, ecdysone agonist...|$|E
40|$|The {{causes of}} the current global decline in honey bee health are unknown. One major group of {{hypotheses}} invokes the pesticides and other xenobiotics to which this important pollinator species is often exposed. Most {{studies have focused on}} mortality or behavioral deficiencies in exposed honey bees while neglecting other biological functions and target organs. The midgut epithelium of honey bees presents an important interface between the insect and its environment. It is maintained by proliferation of intestinal stem cells throughout the adult life of honey bees. We used caged honey bees to test multiple xenobiotics for effects on the replicative activity of the intestinal stem cells under laboratory conditions. Most of the tested compounds did not alter the replicative activity of intestinal stem cells. However, colchicine, <b>methoxyfenozide,</b> tetracycline, and a combination of coumaphos and tau-fluvalinate significantly affected proliferation rate. All substances except <b>methoxyfenozide</b> decreased proliferation rate. Thus, the results indicate that some xenobiotics frequently used in apiculture and known to accumulate in honey bee hives may have hitherto unknown physiological effects. The nutritional status and the susceptibility to pathogens of honey bees could be compromised by the impacts of xenobiotics on the maintenance of the midgut epithelium. This study contributes to a growing body of evidence that more comprehensive testing of xenobiotics may be required before novel or existing compounds can be considered safe for honey bees an...|$|E

Adult earwigs were placed in ventilated containers where they were exposed to insecticide residues on apple leaves and monitored on four occasions over 10 days. Indoxacarb, thiacloprid, spinosad and diazinon caused the greatest mortality to earwigs while carbaryl appeared to be less harmful.

The biorational control agents that not affect significantly to the natural enemies were the nucleopoliedrosis virus SfMNPV and SeMNPV; N. rileyi and Isaria fumosorosea (Wize); Bacillus thuringiensis (Berlinier); the azadirachtin (neem) and parasitoids. In the case of products of chemical synthesis: Spinosad, oxymatrine and bifenthrin showed high rates of mortality in the control of corn pests, so these are considered as of high and moderate risk to Aphis mellifera (L.) bees, the <b>methoxyfenozide</b> presented relatively low toxicity to natural enemies. In general, biorational products have repellent effect on larvae and adults of these insects, inhibit feeding and induce molting, also causing deformities and impede the development and growth, too interfere with sexual intercourse and copulate, reducing the oviposition, as well as cause sterility of adults, so these may also constitute a risk to beneficial organisms. However, we concluded that these products are less toxic than chemical pesticides to nontarget organisms, which eventually will be used with less risk of environment contamination in the control of corn pest in theagricultural region of northern Sinaloa...|$|E
