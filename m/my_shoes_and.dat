In the video, Gaga walks from New York City to Nebraska to get her boyfriend back. According to Gaga: [...] "I'm walking with no luggage and no nothing and it's just me and my ankles are bleeding {{a little bit and}} there's grass stuck in <b>my</b> <b>shoes</b> <b>and</b> I've got this outfit on and it's real sort of New York clothing and I'm sprinting... And the [...] idea that when you're away from someone you love, it's torture," [...] she continued. [...] "I knew I wanted the video to be about me sprinting back and walking hundreds of thousands of miles to get him back." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{choosing}} {{his lead}} single, Drake told Rap-Up, [...] "It’s gotta {{be a real}} great song. It’s gotta be something that I feel is timeless and is better than anything that I’ve ever done." [...] Drake exclusively revealed to Rap-Up on February 15, 2010 that [...] "Over" [...] would be the lead single from his debut album, Thank Me Later, and would be produced by Boi-1da, producer of his previous singles [...] "Best I Ever Had" [...] and [...] "Forever". Drake chose to premiere the song on his hometown Toronto's radio station Flow 93.5. In an interview session with the station, Drake said, [...] "I went with 'Over' as the first look because of {{the words in the}} hook," [...] he said. [...] "The hook being the most repetitive part. I got a lot of great songs on my album. I got songs for women who wanna feel special. I got songs for dudes — if you ever thought my music was too soft, this is one you will enjoy. I got a lot of variety on there, but the biggest thing was that opening line on the hook: 'I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year'." [...] He went on to explain that the record sums up where he is in his career right now, and called it a [...] "great first impression". Drake did a lot of work for the song and also the album in Jamaica, during which he called the [...] "calm before the storm", and called [...] "Over" [...] the storm. He said, [...] "It's the moment. I wanted to emerge at first from this album and just let people know 'This is how I'm coming out in the public eye. I'm ready for anything." [...] He then went to explain that after the album people will be like [...] "he's still human" [...] or [...] "he's still thinking the same way", and said he wanted people to [...] "understand I could have lost it. He said, [...] "'Over' could have been my entire album. Just 'cause that's what this industry and game will do to you if you lose yourself." [...] Drake later said that the song was a [...] "warm-up record". He went on to say, [...] "I love the song. I love the message in the song. It's funny, because 'Over' is the fourth song on the album and it's the turning point in the album. It's like, you get three songs of me sort of trying to paint the picture of what the last year has been like for me — trying to fill you in, almost let you into my world as much as I can. 'Over' is that moment where you're almost worried on the album. 'Is this kid about to ... ? What's happening? Is he changing?' I wanted that to come out first. I wanted people to be a little nervous. This whole journey could have changed me drastically. Fortunately I'm able to step out of <b>my</b> <b>shoes</b> <b>and</b> reflect on it and give you some great music. 'Over' is a great alter-ego moment. It's the dark side of things and I really wanted that to come out first." ...|$|E

2500|$|The book {{sold more}} than one million copies in the first month {{following}} publication; its sales during its first week of availability set a record for a non-fiction book. [...] The success of the book surprised many in the publishing industry, who thought Simon & Schuster had overpaid for the work. It also surprised pundits who had doubted her selling power, including CNN's Tucker Carlson, who had said, [...] "If they sell a million copies of this book, I'll eat <b>my</b> <b>shoes</b> <b>and</b> my tie. I will." [...] (Once past the million mark, Clinton appeared on Carlson's show to present him with a shoe-shaped chocolate cake.) [...] Clinton's energetic promotion of the book, which included signing an estimated 20,000 copies (causing her to require ice and wrist support treatments), was credited for part of the success. [...] By 2007, she had earned over $10 million from the book.|$|E
2500|$|Alone in {{the cabin}} outside Leadville, Baby Doe turned to religion. She {{considered}} her life of great wealth a period of vanity and created penances for herself. During the frigidly bitter Colorado high-country winters, she wound burlap sacks around her legs. With no money, she ate very little, living on stale bread and suet, and refused to accept charity. Baby Doe lived like this for 35 years. [...] During these years she wrote incessantly. In diaries, letters, and scraps she called [...] "Dreams and Visions", consisting of about 2000 fragments later found bundled in piles of paper in her cabin, she wrote entries such as: [...] "Nov. 26—1918 Papa Tabor's Birthday I owe my room rent & am in need of food and only enough bread for tonight & breakfast.... <b>my</b> <b>shoes</b> <b>and</b> stockings only 1 pair are in rags." [...] An eyewitness described her in 1927 as dressed [...] "in corduroy trousers, mining boots, and a torn soiled blouse .... a blue bandana tied around her head", {{and went on to}} say that [...] "her eyes were very far apart and a gorgeous blue".|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Comfort {{is a vital}} {{component}} of orthosis therapy. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine what features of orthoses (design or hardness) influence the perception of comfort by using previously established footwear comfort measures: 100 -mm visual analog scale (VAS) and ranking scale. Methods: Twenty subjects were consecutively allocated to two experiments consisting of five sessions of repeated measures. Comfort measures were taken from four prefabricated orthosis in each session using the VAS (experiment 1) and ranking scale (experiment 2). Subjects in experiment 1 were also asked to rate each orthosis relative to their shoe using a criterion scale. Measures were taken in both walking and jogging. Results: A soft-flat orthosis was found to be significantly more comfortable than all contoured orthoses, including one of the same hardness using both the VAS and ranking scale. Using the VAS, differences between the soft-flat and contoured orthoses were also found to be clinically meaningful for dimensions of overall comfort and arch cushioning (> 10. 2 mm). Perceived comfort of orthoses significantly differed between walking and jogging on the VAS but was not clinically meaningful. Comparisons between the VAS and criterion scale detected a VAS difference of 11. 34 mm between orthoses judged as comfortable as <b>my</b> <b>shoe</b> <b>and</b> slightly more comfortable than <b>my</b> <b>shoe.</b> There was a VAS difference of 17. 49 mm between orthoses judged as comfortable as <b>my</b> <b>shoe</b> <b>and</b> slightly less comfortable than <b>my</b> <b>shoe.</b> Conclusions: Healthy subjects prioritize contouring over hardness when judging the comfort of orthoses. Clinically meaningful changes were required to change or enhance the comfort of orthoses standardized in material type and fabrication. 6 page(s...|$|R
