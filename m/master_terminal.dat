40|$|ABSTRACT [...] -Security of SCADA (supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) {{has become}} a {{challenging}} issue today because of its connectivity {{with the outside world}} and remote access to the system. One major challenge in the SCADA systems is securing the data over the communication channel. PKI (public key infrastructure) is a well known framework for securing the communication. In SCADA system, due to limited bandwidth and rare communications among some RTUs (Remote Terminal Units), there is a need of customization of general PKI which can reduce the openness of Public Key, frequent transfer of certificates and reduction in DOS (Denial of Service) attacks at MTUs (<b>Master</b> <b>Terminal</b> Units) and RTUs. This paper intends to address the issues of securing data over communication channel in the constrained environment and presents the novel solutions pivoted on key distribution and key management schemes.

40|$|Sex {{differences}} {{occur in}} most species and involve {{a variety of}} biological characteristics. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans consists of two sexes, self-fertile hermaphrodites (XX) and males (XO). Males differ from hermaphrodites in morphology, behavior, and life span. Here, we find that male C. elegans worms are much more sensitive than hermaphrodites to oxidative stress and show that the DM domain transcription factor MAB- 3 plays {{a pivotal role in}} determining this male hypersensitivity. The hypersensitivity to oxidative stress does not depend on the dosage of X chromosomes but is determined by the somatic sex determination pathway. Our analyses show that the male hypersensitivity is controlled by MAB- 3, one of the downstream effectors of the <b>master</b> <b>terminal</b> switch TRA- 1 in the sex determination pathway. Moreover, we find that MAB- 3 suppresses expression of several transcriptional target genes of the ELT- 2 GATA factor, which is a global regulator of transcription in the C. elegans intestine, and show that RNA interference (RNAi) against elt- 2 increases sensitivity to oxidative stress. These results strongly suggest that the DM domain protein MAB- 3 regulates oxidative stress sensitivity by repressing transcription of ELT- 2 target genes in the intestine...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSupervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), is a {{technology}} to monitor industrial and critical infrastructures. The SCADA technology was conceived for centralized and isolation processes. Nowadays, {{it is more}} distributed and vulnerable to cyber attacks. SCADA systems are typically composed of three well-defined types of field devices: 1) <b>Master</b> <b>Terminal</b> Units (MTUs) and Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs), located in top and managing all communications; 2) Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) and Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), which control and acquire data from remote equipment and connect with the master station; and 3) sensors and actuators, which act as the input and output functions of the system. Threats to SCADA systems can target the lower layers. For instance, replay and integrity attacks to alter the state estimation conducted by PLCs, actuators and sensors. Given the difficulty of handling such threats at the upper layers, detection and protection against malicious activities must be conducted at the lower layers themselves. Several approaches in the literature propose the adaptation of physical-layer failure detection mechanisms (e. g., systems {{for the detection of}} faults and accidents) to handle malicious attacks (e. g., replay and integrity attacks conducted by malicious adversaries). The talk elaborates on such approaches, and will discuss about some of their limitations. Some conclusions and perspectives for future work will be presente...|$|E
