40|$|Benzylamine is {{introduced}} as a surface passivation molecule that improves the <b>moisture-resistance</b> of the perovskites while simultaneously enhancing their electronic properties. Solar cells based on benzylamine-modified formamidinium lead iodide perovskite films exhibit a champion efficiency of 19. 2 % and an open-circuit voltage of 1. 12 V. The modified FAPbI(3) films exhibit no degradation after > 2800 h air exposure...|$|E
40|$|New process {{developed}} to produce aromatic condensation polyimide films and coatings having dielectric constants in range of 2. 4 to 3. 2. Materials better electrical insulators than state-of-the-art commercial polyimides. Several low-dielectric-constant polyimides have excellent resistance to moisture. Useful as film and coating materials for both industrial and aerospace applications where high electrical insulation, resistance to moisture, mechanical strength, and thermal stability required. Applicable to production of high-temperature and <b>moisture-resistance</b> adhesives, films, photoresists, and coatings. Electronic applications include printed-circuit boards, both of composite and flexible-film types and potential use in automotive, aerospace, and electronic industries...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Marshall {{test design}} methods {{are used to}} design TLA {{modified}} asphalt mixture and base asphalt mixture respectively, and their pavement performance is tested. The results showed {{that there is a}} transforming coefficient of 1. 15 between OAC of TLA modified asphalt mixture and that of base asphalt mixture, and ultimate gradation of the TLA modified asphalt mixture is finer than previous gradation. TLA modified asphalt mixture has excellent high temperature stability, capacity of <b>moisture-resistance</b> damage and impermeability. So it can be applied to asphalt pavements engineering of expressway in China...|$|E
40|$|This paper determines {{possibilities}} of using insulating paper as a humidity sensor element for monitoring the humidity level of transformer oil in power transformers. We propose {{to construct the}} sensor unit of the humidity sensor as a cylindrical capacitor structure, in which the dielectric is the electrically insulating paper soaked in transformer oil. Moreover, we conduct the investigation of relation between conductivity of insulating paper, transformer oil and moisture; temperature and electric field occurring at measuring their resistance at a constant voltage. Furthermore, we determine the electric field value, at which the resistance of insulating paper soaked in transformer oil can be considered dependent only on the temperature and humidity. We also define the formula describing this dependence. The research results show the possibility of creating the humidity sensor based on the transformation of ?<b>moisture-resistance?</b> providing continuous monitoring of moisture in transformer oil during its operation. ?????????? ??????????? ?????????? ??????????????????? ?????? ? ???????? ??????????????? ???????? ??????? ?????????, ???????????????? ??? ???????? ?????????? ????????????????? ????? ? ??????? ???????????????. ?????????? ????????? ?????????????? ??????? ??????? ????????? ? ???? ?????????????? ?????????????? ?????????, ? ??????? ???????????? ???????? ??????????? ? ???????????????? ????? ??????????????????? ??????. ????????? ???????????? ??????????? ?????????????????? ??????????????????? ?????? ? ????????????????? ????? ?? ?????????, ??????????? ? ????????????? ?????????????? ????, ??????? ????????? ??? ????????? ?? ????????????? ?? ?????????? ??????????. ?????????? ???????? ????????????? ?????????????? ????, ??? ??????? ????????????? ??????????? ? ???????????????? ????? ??????????????????? ?????? ????? ??????? ????????? ?????? ?? ????????? ? ???????????. ???????? ????????? ???????, ??????? ????????? ??? ???????????. ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ??????????? ???????? ??????? ?????????, ? ?????? ???????? ???????? ?????????????? ?????????????????????????, ??? ???????? ?????????? ??????????? ???????? ?????????? ????????????????? ????? ? ???????? ??? ????????????...|$|E
