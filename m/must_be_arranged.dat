25|$|Atomix {{takes place}} on a playfield, {{consisting}} {{of a number of}} walls, with the atoms scattered throughout. The player is tasked with assembling a molecule from the atoms; more specifically, the atoms <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>arranged</b> into a specific shape, identical with the shape of the molecule displayed {{on the left side of}} the screen. The player can choose an atom and move it in any of the four cardinal directions; however, a moved atom keeps sliding in one direction until it hits a wall or another atom. Solving the puzzles requires strategic planning in moving the atoms, and on later levels with little free space, even finding room for the completed molecule can be a problem. Once the molecule is assembled, the player receives score; the faster the puzzle is completed, the more score is given.|$|E

25|$|Foreign (non-US citizen) {{students}} applying {{from another}} country form a large and growing percentage of applicants (including accepted applicants) to American universities. According to Andover counseling director Sean Logan, applications to American universities from foreign students have increased dramatically in the past decade. International applications are typically similar to domestic ones but with additional complications. Most international applicants do not receive a GPA score or transcript from their school. Most will not normally take SAT or ACT exams, so these <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>arranged.</b> Most American universities are happy to accept international and foreign qualifications such as the International Baccalaureate or IB, or British A Levels, although it is often up to the applicant to elaborate {{on the meaning of}} these qualifications. Non-native English speakers may be asked to provide English language qualifications. If a university requires or offers an interview, these can normally be conducted over the phone or with alumni residing in the applicant's country, according to Uni in the USA, a guide book catering to the growing number of British students seeking to study in the United States. International applicants often must cope with higher tuition fees and less available financial aid, although this varies significantly by college. Further, international applicants also have to apply for a student visa, which can be a complex and time-consuming process.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} of those arrangements is when rooks are symmetric about {{the centre of}} the board. Let us designate with Gn the number of arrangements in which n rooks are placed on a board with n ranks and n files. Now let us make the board to contain 2n ranks and 2n files. A rook on the first file can be placed on any of the 2n squares of that file. According to the symmetry condition, placement of this rook defines the placement of the rook that stands on the last file − it <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>arranged</b> symmetrically to the first rook about the board centre. Let us remove the first and the last files and the ranks that are occupied by rooks (since the number of ranks is even, the removed rooks cannot stand on the same rank). This will give a board of 2n−2 files and 2n−2 ranks. It is clear that to each symmetric arrangement of rooks on the new board corresponds a symmetric arrangement of rooks on the original board. Therefore, G2n = 2nG2n−2 (the factor 2n in this expression comes from the possibility for the first rook to occupy any of the 2n squares on the first file). By iterating the above formula one reaches to the case of a 22 board, on which there are 2 symmetric arrangements (on the diagonals). As a result of this iteration, the final expression is G2n = 2n'n! For the usual chessboard (88), G8 = 244! = 1624 = 384 centrally symmetric arrangements of 8 rooks. One such arrangement is shown in Fig. 2.|$|E

Terminology identified by The International Children’sContinence Society (ICCS) is recommended. Bed-wettingat night during sleep (incontinence) in children above 5 years of age who don’t have congenital or acquired centralnervous system defect is defined as enuresis nocturna. There are two groups monosymptomatic (simple) and non-monosymptomatic (complicated). Monosymptomaticenuresis nocturna (MNE) has no symptoms otherthan bed-wetting at night during sleep. Various theoriesconcerning etiology of MNE has been suggested; one ormore of genetic, hormonal, bladder associated and sleepdisorders are stated to play a role.

2500|$|First, a piano action <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>arranged</b> {{so that a}} key press {{does not}} {{actually}} lift the hammer {{all the way to}} the string. If it did, the hammer would block on the string and damp its vibrations. The position of the sprung 'hopper' or 'jack' centred in the key of Cristofori's action (see [...] "I" [...] in diagram below) is so adjusted that the hopper escapes from the 'notch' in the middle of the intermediate lever (G) just before the hammer (C) strikes the string, so that the hammer is not driven all the way but travels the remaining distance under its own momentum and then falls into the check (M). When the key is allowed to return to its position of rest, the jack springs back under the notch and a repeated blow is possible. Although Cristofori's design incorporates no specific device for repetition, the lightness of the action gives more facility for repetition than the heavier actions of the English type that developed in the first half of the 19th century, until these were provided with additions of one kind or another to facilitate repetition.|$|E
