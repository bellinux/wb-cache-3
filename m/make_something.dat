He's always so positive and so sure and he never wants to repeat himself. Like, 'How can I <b>make</b> <b>something</b> different and new and not like anything else?' I look back at that whole record, and I think, 'Wow I wish there was more time to do more singles.' You only get {{so many things that}} people hear.|$|E
5|$|The teams {{came out}} for the second half, and Rangers began an attack almost immediately. A series of short, quick passes from Marsh and Roger Morgan {{released}} Allen {{but he was not}} quick enough to <b>make</b> <b>something</b> of the chance. A high pass from Keen followed, striking defender Clarke in the back, from which the Albion defence were forced to clear. The attacks continued to come from Rangers as Lazarus passed the ball through to Marsh who took the ball around two defenders, but his shot went over the bar. QPR were rewarded for their perseverance in the sixty-third minute as Lazarus took the ball around Albion captain Graham Williams, crossing the ball in for Morgan, who scored with a header to reduce the deficit to a single goal.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, Universal chief Carl Laemmle, Jr. offered Whale {{his choice}} of any {{property}} the studio owned. He chose Frankenstein, mostly because none of Universal's other properties particularly interested him {{and he wanted to}} <b>make</b> <b>something</b> other than a war picture. While the novel itself was in the public domain, Universal owned the filming rights to a stage adaptation by Peggy Webling. Whale cast Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein and Mae Clarke as his fiancée Elizabeth. For the Monster, he turned to an unknown actor named Boris Karloff. Shooting began on 24 August 1931 and wrapped on 3 October. Previews were held 29 October, with wide release on 21 November. Frankenstein was an instant hit with critics and the public. The film received glowing reviews and shattered box office records across the United States, earning Universal $12 million on first release.|$|E

25|$|Brazelton {{admitted}} in a 2003 interview {{that when he}} started the comic and was unsure as to its potential longevity, he fell back on using himself and those close to him to avoid writing backstories for potentially short-lived characters.

In 2009, Brazelton confessed that if he were to go back with what he knew now, he would begin again with all-original characters, despite the artificial familiarity it breeds in his fans. The main characters which have been based on real people are author Tom, his wife Cami, their beagle Truman, and Tom's friend Jared. Brazelton has gone on record saying his young son, Henry, will not be joining the comic strip because of the limitations it would put on he and his wife's characters to be responsible and parental.|$|E
25|$|An oral {{tale about}} the shava sadhana is {{told by the}} Tantrikas of Bengal. Vasudeva Bhattacharya of Tipperah (West Bengal) went to the Goddess temple of Kamakhya and worshipped the deity by Tantric means. A voice {{told him about the}} ritual and that he will gain moksha in his next life when he will be reborn as his own {{grandson}} Sarvananda. Vasudeva gave his servant Purvananda an engraved copper plate with a mantra. Purvananda, now an old man, now served Sarvananda, who he passed the secret of shava sadhana ritual, told by his former master. Purvananda volunteered to be used as the corpse for shava sadhana and Sarvananda performed the ritual, where ghosts tormented him; storms tried to interrupt his practice; beautiful dancers tempted him, until the Goddess gave him a vision. She blessed him with vak siddhi, the ability to <b>make</b> <b>something</b> happen by just saying it. She also revived the servant. Sarvananda became a siddha and the first tantrika to see the theophany of the Goddess' ten mahavidya forms. The Shakta poet Ramprasad Sen is also told to have performed the ritual and gained the vision of his patron, goddess Kali.|$|E
