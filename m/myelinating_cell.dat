However, {{the cellular}} function of NDRG 1 {{and how it}} causes CMT 4 D are poorly understood. We report that NDRG 1 silencing in epithelial cells results in decreased uptake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) due to reduced LDL receptor (LDLR) abundance at the plasma membrane. This is accompanied by the accumulation of LDLR in enlarged EEA 1 -positive endosomes that contain numerous intraluminal vesicles and sequester ceramide. Concomitantly, LDLR ubiquitylation is increased but its degradation is reduced and ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) proteins are downregulated. Co-depletion of IDOL (inducible degrader of the LDLR), which ubiquitylates the LDLR and promotes its degradation, rescues plasma membrane LDLR levels and LDL uptake. In murine oligodendrocytes, Ndrg 1 silencing not only results in reduced LDL uptake but also in downregulation of the oligodendrocyte differentiation factor Olig 2. Both phenotypes are rescued by co-silencing of Idol, suggesting that ligand uptake through LDLR family members controls oligodendrocyte differentiation. These findings identify NDRG 1 as a novel regulator of multivesicular body formation and endosomal LDLR trafficking.

Mice with EAE were treated with rhGGF 2 during both the acute and relapsing phases. Clinically, GGF 2 treatment delayed signs, decreased severity, and resulted in statistically significant reductions in relapse rate. rhGGF 2 -treated groups displayed CNS lesions with more remyelination than in controls. This correlated with increased mRNA expression of myelin basic protein exon 2, a marker for remyelination, and with an increase in the CNS of the regulatory cytokine, interleukin 10, at both the RNA and protein levels. Thus, a beneficial effect of a neurotrophic growth factor has been demonstrated on the clinical, pathologic, and molecular manifestations of autoimmune demyelination, an effect that was associated with increased expression of a T helper 2 cytokine. rhGGF 2 treatment may represent a novel approach to the treatment of multiple sclerosis...|$|E

Both products are classically thought to express predominantly in oligodendrocytes. However, accumulating evidence suggests Plp expression is more widespread than previously thought. In an attempt to create a mouse model for inducing oligodendrocyte-specific gene deletions, we have generated transgenic mice expressing a Cre recombinase cDNA under control of the mouse Plp promoter. We demonstrate Plp promoter driven Cre expression is restricted predominantly to mature oligodendrocytes of the central nervous system (CNS) at postnatal day 28. However, crosses into the Rosa 26 LacZ and mT/mG reporter mouse lines reveal robust and widespread Cre activity in neuronal tissues at E 15. 5 and E 10. 5 that is not strictly oligodendrocyte lineage specific. By P 28, all CNS tissues examined displayed high levels of reporter gene expression well outside of defined white matter zones. Importantly, our study reinforces the emerging idea that Plp promoter activity is not restricted to the <b>myelinating</b> <b>cell</b> lineage, but rather, has widespread activity both during embryonic and early postnatal development in the CNS.

40|$|The {{oligodendrocyte}} (OL), the <b>myelinating</b> <b>cell</b> of {{the central}} nervous system, undergoes {{dramatic changes in the}} organization of its cytoskeleton as it differentiates from a precursor (oligodendrocyte precursor cells) to a myelin-forming cell. These changes include an increase in its branching cell processes, a phenomenon necessary for OL to myelinate multiple axon segments. We have previously shown that levels and activity of non-muscle myosin II (NMII), a regulator of cytoskeletal contractility, decrease as a function of differentiation and that inhibition of NMII increases branching and myelination of OL in coculture with neurons. We have also found that mixed glial cell cultures derived from NMIIB knockout mice display an increase in mature myelin basic protein-expressing OL compared with wild-type cultures. We have now extended our studies to investigate the role of NMIIB ablation on myelin repair following focal demyelination by lysolecithin. To this end, we generated an oligodendrocyte-specific inducible knockout model using a Plp-driven promoter in combination with a temporally activated CRE-ER fusion protein. Our data indicate that conditional ablation of NMII in adult mouse brain, expedites lesion resolution and remyelination by Plp 1 oligodendrocyte-lineage cells when compared with that observed in control brains.

40|$|OLs (oligodendrocytes) are the myelinating {{cells of}} the CNS (central nervous system), {{wrapping}} axons in conductive sheathes to ensure effective transmission of neural signals. The regulation of OL development, from precursor to mature <b>myelinating</b> <b>cell,</b> is controlled {{by a variety of}} inhibitory and inductive signalling factors. The dorsal spinal cord contains signals that inhibit OL development, possibly to prevent premature and ectopic precursor differentiation. The Wnt and BMP (bone morphogenic protein) signalling pathways have been identified as dorsal spinal cord signals with overlapping temporal activity, and both have similar inhibitory effects on OL differentiation. Both these pathways feature prominently in many developmental processes and demyelinating events after injury, and they are known to interact in complex inductive, inhibitive and synergistic manners in many developing systems. The interaction between BMP and Wnt signalling in OL development, however, has not been extensively explored. In the present study, we examine the relationship between the canonical Wnt and BMP pathways. We use pharmacological and genetic paradigms to show that both Wnt 3 a and BMP 4 will inhibit OL differentiation in vitro. We also show that when the canonical BMP signalling pathway is blocked, neither Wnt 3 a nor BMP 4 have inhibitory effects on OL differentiation. In contrast, abrogating the Wnt signalling pathway does not alter the actions of BMP 4 treatment. Our results indicate that the BMP signalling pathway is necessary for the canonical Wnt signalling pathway to exert its effects on OL development, but not vice versa, suggesting that Wnt signals upstream of BMP...|$|E
40|$|In vertebrates, myelination is {{required}} for the saltatory signal conductance along the axon. At the onset of myelination, the <b>myelinating</b> <b>cells,</b> i. e., oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system, are heavily engaged in the biogenesis of membranes that are wrapped around the axon to form the myelin sheath. Although the membrane of the myelin sheath is continuous with the plasma membrane surrounding the cell body, the composition of both membrane domains is clearly distinct implying that <b>myelinating</b> <b>cells</b> are polarized cells. The coordinated manner of myelin sheath formation requires the existence of sorting and trafficking pathways to establish and maintain this highly polarized phenotype. Although in vitro data show that the formation of myelin-like membranes is an intrinsic property of oligodendrocytes, exogenous factors modulate myelination and are required for the subcompartmentation and compaction of the myelin sheath in vivo. In this paper, we discuss the sorting and trafficking of myelin proteins and lipids in oligodendrocytes in relation to polarity development and maintenance, including the role of exogenous factors, and give examples how the perturbation of trafficking pathways may {{contribute to the development of}} demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system...|$|R

40|$|Myelin {{damage is}} known to {{increase}} in the normal aging brain and to correlate with age-related cognitive decline. While the causes of increased myelin damage are unknown, here we consider whether the brain’s innate capacity for remyelination diminishes with age and hence could contribute to myelin damage through slow accumulation of myelin defects. Maintenance and repair of myelin depends upon oligodendroglia precursor cells (OPCs), which must differentiate into {{a sufficient number of}} healthy mature oligodendroglia (oligos), the <b>myelinating</b> <b>cell</b> of the brain. The extracellular matrix molecule hyaluronic acid (HA) has been shown to inhibit maturation of OPCs into mature myelinating oligos. The present study examined aging changes in myelination using four markers: the damaged myelin basic protein (dMBP) antibody, a histochemical reaction to stain HA, and immunohistochemistry for OPCs and mature oligos. These markers were quantified using cell density (oligos and OPCs), percent area stained (HA and dMBP), and fluorescence intensity (HA and dMBP). Relationships between these markers, age, and behavioral measures of cognitive function were investigated using single and multiple regression analyses. Results showed that in the corpus callosum and cingulum bundle of the rhesus monkey, staining for dMBP as a marker of myelin damage strongly correlated with increases in HA. The increase in HA in the cingulum bundle correlated positively with age. OPC density increased with age in both the cingulum bundle and corpus callosum. Mature oligo density did not change significantly with age, but approached {{a significant increase in the}} cingulum and approached a significant decrease in the corpus callosum. The increase in OPC density correlated positively with both HA and dMBP in the cingulum bundle. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that HA accumulation contributes to myelin damage by inhibiting the differentiation of OPCs into mature oligodendrocytes, diminishing the brain’s innate capacity for remyelination with age...|$|E

We are developing a 3 D <b>myelinating</b> <b>cell</b> culture model that is amenable to continuous observation and controlled manipulation, which will allow us to follow the dynamic process of myelination in vitro. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are isolated from P 1 - 2 rat pups, seeded into poly-L-ornithine-coated flasks and expanded by treatment with b-FGF and PDGF. OPCs are recovered and suspended within a neutralized solution of Type-I rat-tail collagen. This suspension is then poured into wells of a 24 -well or 96 -well plate, where it sets to form a gel with cells seeded evenly throughout its volume. Gels are 1 to 2 mm thick; sufficient to provide a 3 D environment for the cells, yet still permit microscopic monitoring at all depths. Differentiation is triggered by withdrawal of PDGF and bFGF and addition of medium containing triiodothronine, ciliary neurotrophin factor (CNTF) and N-acetyl cysteine. Within 2 days, expression of MBP is observed in differentiating oligodendrocytes, and, in co-cultures with neurones, MBP 1 oligodendrocytes are observed associated with axonal processes.

Mutations in AFG 3 L 2 have been implicated in dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA 28) and recessive spastic ataxia-neuropathy syndrome (SPAX 5). Mutations of SPG 7, encoding paraplegin, are linked to hereditary spastic paraplegia. In the mouse, a third subunit AFG 3 L 1 is expressed. Various mouse models recapitulate the phenotype of these neurodegenerative disorders, however, the pathogenic mechanism of neurodegeneration is not completely understood. Here, we studied several mouse models and focused on cell-autonomous role of the m-AAA protease in neurons and myelinating cells. We show that lack of Afg 3 l 2 triggers mitochondrial fragmentation and swelling, tau hyperphosphorylation and pathology in Afg 3 l 2 full-body and forebrain neuron-specific knockout mice. Moreover, deletion of Afg 3 l 2 in adult myelinating cells causes early-onset mitochondrial abnormalities as in the neurons, but the survival of these cells is not affected, which is a contrast to early neuronal death. Despite the fact that myelinating cells have been previously shown to survive respiratory deficiency by glycolysis, total ablation of the m-AAA protease by deleting Afg 3 l 2 in an Afg 3 l 1 null background (DKO), leads to <b>myelinating</b> <b>cell</b> demise and subsequently progressive axonal demyelination. Interestingly, DKO mice show premature hair greying due to loss of melanoblasts. Together, our data demonstrate cell-autonomous survival thresholds to m-AAA protease deficiency, and an essential role of the m-AAA protease to prevent cell death independent from mitochondrial dynamics and the oxidative capacity of the cell. Thus, our findings provide novel insights to the pathogenesis of diseases linked to m-AAA protease deficiency, and also establish valuable mitochondrial dysfunctional mouse models to study other neurodegenerative diseases, such as tauopathies and demyelinating diseases. ...|$|E

With the advance of single-cell transcriptomics, particularly RNA-seq, a new toolbox has become available for molecular cell type classification.

40|$|Recent studies {{examining}} cell-cell interactions during CNS development and following disease or trauma have highlighted our limited {{understanding of the}} in vivo functions of the <b>myelinating</b> <b>cell</b> of the CNS, the oligodendrocyte. With this in mind, our laboratory has developed techniques by which a profile of proteins derived from or regulated by oligodendrocytes can be elucidated. Specifically, we have demonstrated that oligodendrocytes can be selectively eliminated from one optic nerve of a rat by treating the animal with a unilateral exposure of X-irradiation {{at the time of}} birth. Consequently, this approach allowed us to experimentally create, within the same animal, one optic nerve devoid of oligodendrocytes and their progenitors (the X- irradiated side) and one optic nerve containing the normal oligodendrocyte population (the untreated side). Using this experimental animal model we hypothesized that uncharacterized proteins, derived from and regulated by oligodendrocytes, which are crucial for CNS development can be identified. Specifically, by comparing protein profiles found within the normal myelinating optic nerve versus the X-irradiated optic nerve, where oligodendrocytes are absent, potential oligodendrocyte-derived proteins can be quickly identified. Further verification that these proteins are indeed related to oligodendrocytes and/or the processes of myelination can be obtained by their reappearance in the 2 -D gel protein profile of P 28 X-irradiated nerves that, as we have shown previously, undergo a delayed myelination.

Myelination is blocked in myelin-competent cultures derived from Ski-deficient animals, and genes encoding myelin components are downregulated in Ski-deficient nerves. Conversely, overexpression of Ski in Schwann cells causes an upregulation of myelin-related genes. The myelination-regulating transcription factor Oct 6 is involved in a complex modulatory relationship with Ski. We conclude that Ski is a crucial signal in Schwann cell development and myelination...|$|R
40|$|Axons {{are linked}} to {{induction}} of myelination during development and {{to the maintenance of}} myelin and myelinated tracts in the adult CNS. Currently, it is unknown whether and how axonal plasticity in adult CNS impacts the <b>myelinating</b> <b>cells</b> and their precursors. In this article, we report that newly formed axonal sprouts are able to induce a protracted myelination response in adult CNS. We show that newly formed axonal sprouts, induced by lesion of the entorhino–hippocampal perforant pathway, have the ability to induce a myelination response in stratum radiatum and lucidum CA 3. The lesion resulted in significant recruitment of newly formed <b>myelinating</b> <b>cells,</b> documented by incorporation of the proliferation marker bromodeoxyuridine into chondroitin sulphate NG 2 expressing cells in stratum radiatum and lucidum CA 3 early after lesion, and the occurrence of a 28 % {{increase in the number of}} oligodendrocytes, of which some had incorporated bromodeoxyuridine, 9 weeks post-lesion. Additionally, a marked increase (41 %) in myelinated fibres was detected in silver stained sections. Interestingly, these apparently new fibres achieved the same axon diameter as unlesioned mice but myelin thickness remained thinner than normal, suggesting that the sprouting axons in stratum radiatum and lucidum CA 3 were not fully myelinated 9 weeks after lesion. Our combined results show that sprouting axons provide a strong stimulus to oligodendrocyte lineage cells to engage actively in the myelination processes in the adult CNS...|$|R
40|$|<b>Myelinating</b> <b>cells</b> wrap axons with multi-layered myelin sheaths {{for rapid}} impulse propagation. Dysfunctions of oligodendrocytes or Schwann cells are often {{associated}} with neuroinflammation, as observed in animal models of leukodystrophies and peripheral neuropathies, respectively. The neuroinflammatory response modulates the pathological changes, including demyelination and axonal injury, but also remyelination and repair. Here we discuss different immune mechanisms as well as factors released or exposed by myelinating glia in disease conditions. The spectrum of inflammatory mediators varies with different myelin disorders and has {{a major impact on}} the beneficial or detrimental role of immune cells in keeping nervous system integrity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn most cell types {{sphingomyelin}} is synthesized predominantly in the cis-medial compartments of the Golgi stacks {{whereas the}} contribution of the plasma membrane is much lower. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess {{the contribution of}} both compartments to the synthesis of sphingomyelin in <b>myelinating</b> <b>cells.</b> Therefore, oligodendrocytes from rat spinal cord were incubated in culture with fluorescently- or radiolabelled ceramides, and the effects of a block in the vesicular flow (monensin, brefeldin A, low temperature) on surface synthesis of sphingomyelin were evaluated. The results indicate that ≈ 50 % of the sphingomyelin synthase is present at the plasma and myelin membranes of oligodendrocytes...|$|R
40|$|However, as the {{infection}} progresses and bac-teria undergo unrestrained multiplication, {{the availability of}} nonmyelinating Schwann cells becomes a limiting factor. To avoid such a situation, leprosy bacilli may induce demyeli-nation and axonal damage as an effective strat-egy {{to increase the number}} of nonmyelinating Schwann cells so that a sufficient intracellular niche is available for bacterial survival. Be-cause <b>myelinated</b> Schwann <b>cells</b> do not serve as an intracellular niche for M. leprae, we propose that M. leprae propagates a nonmyelinating phenotype by inducing demyelination and nerve injury in <b>myelinated</b> Schwann <b>cells</b> in the early phase of infection, a novel bacterial sur-vival strategy in the nervous system...|$|R
40|$|Background: The quaking viable (qk v) mice have uncompacted myelin {{in their}} central and {{peripheral}} nervous system (CNS, PNS). The qk gene encodes 3 major alternatively spliced isoforms that contain unique sequence at their C-terminus dictating their cellular localization. QKI- 5 is a nuclear isoform, whereas QKI- 6 and QKI- 7 are cytoplasmic isoforms. The qk v mice harbor an enhancer/promoter deletion that prevents the expression of isoforms QKI- 6 and QKI- 7 in <b>myelinating</b> <b>cells</b> resulting in a dysmyelination phenotype. It was shown that QKI regulates the differentiation of oligodendrocytes, the <b>myelinating</b> <b>cells</b> of the CNS, however, {{little is known about}} the role of the QKI proteins, or RNA binding proteins in PNS myelination. Methodology/Principal Findings: To define the role of the QKI proteins in PNS myelination, we ectopically expressed QKI- 6 and QKI- 7 in primary rat Schwann cell/neuron from dorsal root ganglia cocultures. We show that the QKI isoforms blocked proliferation and promoted Schwann cell differentiation and myelination. In addition, these events were coordinated with elevated proteins levels of p 27 KIP 1 and myelin basic protein (MBP), markers of Schwann cell differentiation. QKI- 6 and QKI- 7 expressing co-cultures contained myelinated fibers that had directionality and contained significantly thicker myelin, as assessed by electron microscopy. Moreover, QKI-deficient Schwann cells had reduced levels of MBP, p 27 KIP 1 and Krox- 20 mRNAs, as assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings suggest that the QKI- 6 and QKI- 7 RNA binding proteins are positive regulators o...|$|R
