500|$|Beyoncé {{appeared}} on stage wearing a floor-length white gown with micro-sequins from designer Marc Bouwer's pre-fall collection while {{her hair was}} {{pulled back in a}} sleek ponytail. She performed on a high-rise stage with a big screen spanning from ceiling to floor behind her. As she sang, the screen filled with images of U.N. aid workers on the scene in various wars, famines, and floods around the world. Following the performance, she announced, [...] "I'd like to ask everyone to make sure they're a part of August 19th... It's such a beautiful, beautiful day, and I'd like to honor the 22 people who lost their lives. God bless you all. Thank you so <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> me." [...] The music video for the song starts with Beyoncé singing the song with the U.N. audience seated in front of her, and images from recent disasters screening in panoramic view behind her. As the song progresses, scenes of globes and constellations turn up; laser lights and a small blue arrow, imprinted with the song's title, trace a path along the globe. The performance footage is also mixed with images of global volunteer efforts; as the giant screen displays globe-reaching graphics they morph into pictures of humanitarian work. The music video ends with the question [...] "What Will You Do?" [...] and offers the official website for the World Humanitarian Day.|$|E
2500|$|In the post-fight interview, an {{emotional}} Fury said, [...] "This {{is a dream}} come true. We worked so hard for this. I've done it. It's hard to come to foreign countries ‎and get decisions. It just means {{so much to me}} to come here and get the decision." [...] He then took the microphone to thank Klitschko, [...] "I'd like to say to Wladimir, you're a great champion. And thanks very <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> me. It was all fun and games during the buildup." [...] Klitschko failed to throw his well-known right hand, mostly due to Fury's constant movement and mocking. He said, [...] "Tyson was the faster and better man tonight. I felt quite comfortable in the first six rounds, but I was astonished that Tyson was so fast in the second half as well. I couldn't throw my right hand because the advantage was the longer distance he had." [...] Klitschko had a rematch clause in place.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, I know that, I know that. Well, now we {{understand}} each other, so I must be turning home. Thank you so <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> been quite candid with me. Good morning, Miss Layard; remember me to Stephen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{never have}} a moment of {{excitement}} {{from the beginning to}} the end. I don't think I care very <b>much</b> <b>for</b> novels. <b>Have</b> you nothing else?' ...|$|R
60|$|This pleased Helga very <b>much,</b> <b>for</b> she <b>had</b> {{never had}} {{anything}} of her own; and she smiled quite happily as she thanked Habogi for his present.|$|R
50|$|Beautiful Losers {{has entered}} the canon of Canadian literature, and has been given <b>much</b> credit <b>for</b> <b>having</b> {{introduced}} postmodern literature to Canadian fiction.|$|R
60|$|So {{they stand}} beside the cross, {{and read the}} words, and they neither of them can say anything, though the white sweet face is before the eyes of their mind at the same time, and Ellen thinks she loves Paul twice as <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> {{been one of his}} great comforts.|$|E
6000|$|... "I admit," [...] I answered, {{although}} I {{was trembling}} {{so much that}} I could hardly speak with steadiness, [...] "that a woman may be splendid and lovely beyond anything that the mind of man can conceive, whatever her age, of which I know nothing. I would add this, Ayesha, that I thank you very <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> revealed to me the glory that is hid beneath your veil." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{the next}} three months, he stayed in Stoubes. Roger had been sent off at once, with two men-at-arms, to bring the horses and armour {{that had been left}} at Welshpool; bearing a letter to the {{governor}} from Oswald, thanking him <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> taken care of them, and saying briefly that he had been left on the field for dead, after the fight near Llanidloes; but had recovered, and been well treated by Glendower, who had put him to ransom. He took money with him, to pay the expenses for the keep of the horses; and returned, with them and the armour, after an absence of three weeks.|$|E
60|$|But we can {{not blame}} him <b>much</b> <b>for</b> not <b>having</b> learned this {{particular}} wisdom at five years of age, when so many full-grown men and women never learn it at all.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm all right," [...] {{he cried}} to her, putting into his voice all the heartiness he could command, {{which was not}} <b>much,</b> <b>for</b> he <b>had</b> himself been under no mean nervous strain.|$|R
60|$|So <b>much</b> <b>for</b> {{things which}} <b>have</b> life. Take an equally notorious example from things {{which have not}} life.|$|R
6000|$|... "A very {{pleasant}} evening," [...] he began, {{as soon as}} Mr. Woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary, told that he understood, and the papers swept away;--"particularly pleasant. You and Miss Fairfax gave us some very good music. I do not know a more luxurious state, sir, than sitting at one's ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation. I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant, Emma. You left nothing undone. I was glad you made her play so <b>much,</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> no instrument at her grandmother's, {{it must have been}} a real indulgence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> a {{wife and}} a child! Canst thou not make any {{difference}} between them that have had ancestors and who have descendants, and one that hath no other tie in the world than his name? The Señor Don Almirante is either an exceeding great man, and chosen by Providence to open the way into the unknown seas of which he speaketh; or he is but a hungry Genoese, that is leading us he knoweth not whither, that he may eat, and drink, and sleep, in honor, while we are toiling at his heels, like patient mules dragging the load that the horse despiseth. In the one case, he is too great and exalted to heed idle words; and in the other, what is there too bad for a Castilian to tell him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well said!' {{answered}} the miller heartily. 'But {{you may be}} sure {{that there will be}} no unseemly rejoicing, to disturb ye in your present frame of mind. All the morning I felt more ashamed than I cared to own at the thought of how the neighbours, great and small, would laugh at what they would call your folly, when they knew what had happened; so I resolved to take this step to stave it off, if so be 'twas possible. And when I saw Mrs. Garland I knew I had done right. She pitied me so <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> had the house cleaned in vain, and laid in provisions to waste, that it put her into the humour to agree. We mean to do it right off at once, afore the pies and cakes get mouldy and the blackpot stale. 'Twas a good thought of mine and hers, and I am glad 'tis settled,' he concluded cheerfully.|$|E
60|$|We {{were five}} days on our journey from Calais to Paris, which {{we went through}} with <b>much</b> satisfaction, <b>for,</b> <b>having</b> fine weather and good attendance, we had nothing to hope for.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thank you}} <b>much,</b> monsieur, <b>for</b> <b>having</b> let me pass," [...] Edgar said gratefully. [...] "I feared {{so much that}} I {{should not be allowed}} to enter to speak for him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said he, [...] "now I {{will see}} the gay world. My living, won't cost me <b>much,</b> <b>for</b> I <b>have</b> no mouth, you see, and no inside; so I can never be hungry nor have the stomach-ache neither." ...|$|R
6000|$|In this {{condition}} of mind, he had determined that he {{owed it to}} himself to do or say something that should frighten his lordship into a more generous final arrangement. There had been, {{he said to himself}} again and again, such a confidence with a lady of so high a rank, that the owner of it ought not to be allowed to languish upon two or even upon three hundred a-year. If the whole thing could really be explained to the Marquis, the Marquis would probably see it himself. And to all this was to be added the fact that no harm had been done. The Marchioness owed him very <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> wished to assist her in getting rid of an heir that was disagreeable to her. The Marquis owed him more for not having done it. And they both owed him very much in that he had never said a word of it all to anybody else. He had thought that he might be clever enough to make the Marquis understand something of this without actually explaining it. That some mysterious promise had been made, and that, as the promise could not be kept, some compensation should be awarded,--this was what he had desired to bring home to the mind of the Marquis. He had betrayed no confidence. He intended to betray none. He was very anxious that the Marquis should be aware, that as he, Mr. Greenwood, was a gentleman, all confidences would be safe in his hands; but then the Marquis ought to do his part of the business, and not turn his confidential Chaplain out of the house after {{a quarter of a century}} with a beggarly annuity of two hundred a-year! ...|$|E
6000|$|So <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> {{a first-rate}} {{lawyer and a}} man of {{character}} on my side. Daggett gave the whole thing up, on the spot,--re-conveying to me Clawbonny before he quitted, though the sale would unquestionably be set aside, and subsequently was set aside, {{by means of an}} amicable suit. A great deal remained to be done, however; and I was obliged to tear myself away from Lucy, in order to do it. Probate of the will was {{to be made in the}} distant county of Genessee--and distant it was from New York, in 1804! The journey that could be made, to day, in about thirty hours, took me ten days: and I spent near a month in going through the necessary forms, and in otherwise settling my affairs at the west, as that part of the State was then called. The time, however, was not wasted below. Mr. Hardinge took charge of everything at Clawbonny, and Lucy's welcome letters,--three of which reached me weekly,--informed me that everything was re-established in the house, on the farm, and at the mill. The Wallingford was set running again, and all the oxen, cows, horses, hogs, &c., &c., were living in their old haunts. The negroes were reinstated, and Clawbonny was itself again! The only chants made wore for the better; the occasion having been improved, to paint and new-vamp the house, which Mr. Daggett's parsimony had prevented him from defacing by modern alterations. In a word, 'Masser Mile' was alone wanting to make all at the farm happy. Chloe had communicated her engagement to 'Miss Lucy,' and it was understood Neb and his master were to be married about the same time. As for Moses, he had gone up to Willow Cove, on a leave of absence. A letter received from him, which now lies before me, will give a better account of his proceedings and feelings than I can write myself. It was in the following words, viz.: ...|$|E
50|$|Everyone who {{has come}} into contact with her in her work agrees with myself that she is the best of us all. In J…’s absence, she acted as my Lieutenant. Shared every danger. Took part in a December {{reception}} committee with myself and some others. Has a perfect understanding of security and an imperturbable calmness. Thank you very <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> sent her to me.|$|E
50|$|After getting <b>much</b> {{attention}} <b>for</b> <b>having</b> founded {{his company}} {{at the age of}} 15, Lorenzen penned an article that was published on Fox News about the ten things he wish he had known before he started his company.|$|R
6000|$|... "The navy, I think, who <b>have</b> done so <b>much</b> <b>for</b> us, <b>have</b> {{at least}} an equal claim with any other set of men, for all the comforts and all the {{privileges}} which any home can give. Sailors work hard enough for their comforts, we must all allow." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{mention of}} the family was too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> Sally. She <b>had</b> to stop talking {{in order to allow}} her mind to clear itself of rude thoughts.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, Fest became {{embroiled in a}} public dispute with the left-wing writer and Nobel Prize winner Günter Grass, who had {{admitted}} in his autobiography that he had joined the Waffen-SS in {{the last months of}} World War II. Fest criticised Grass, not so <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> joined, but for having concealed the fact for so many years while engaging in political criticism of others over their Nazi pasts. He said: [...] "After 60 years, this confession comes a bit too late. I can't understand how someone who for decades set himself up as a moral authority, a rather smug one, could pull this off." ...|$|E

40|$|Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping (pronounced Shee Jin-ping) is {{scheduled}} to visit the United States in mid-February, 2012, returning Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. 's August 2011 visit to China, which Xi hosted. The fact that Xi is the heir apparent to China's current top leader, Hu Jintao, who {{is scheduled}} to retire in the coming year, makes this more than an ordinary vice presidential visit. Xi's trip {{is designed to help}} him build relationships with American policymakers and legislators and introduce himself to the American business community and the American people {{on the eve of his}} becoming China's top leader. As important to the Chinese side, the trip could also play an important role in helping boost Xi's stature back home, where he is so far known as <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> a famous father, early Communist Party revolutionary Xi Zhongxun, and a famous wife, military folk singer Peng Liyuan, as for his own achievements...|$|E

40|$|Int: Good morning Lady Scott. Thank {{you very}} <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> us here. Just {{for the record}} it is 10 : 26 {{on the morning of}} the 6 th of October 2005. My name is Jeffery Boswall and thank you again for having us. I’m going to presume to call you Philippa if I may because you won’t {{remember}} but I can remember, just outside here, just we are in the studio of course, the famous studio with the picture window at what is now called the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust [WWT] at Slimbridge in Gloucestershire. And I first met you, you won’t remember but I did, before you were married, when you worked here, out there, probably within a hundred yards of here and I can remember that your name of course then was Talbot-Ponsonby. Do I say ‘Talbot’ [emphasises ‘a ’ sound] or ‘Tolbot ’ [emphasises an ‘o ’ sound]? PS: Well I say ‘Tolbot ’ [emphasises an ‘o ’ sound] but you can say whatever you like! Int: No no, I’m going to say what you say cos you are in a better position to know than I am. PS: ‘Talbot-Ponsonby ’ is right. Int: Yeh. Thank you. ‘Talbot-Ponsonby ’ is more correct. Thank you. And I don’t whether you have read the notes produced by our producer but it does say that you and I are having an informal affair this morning. And the closest I can ever remember of you and I ever getting to that status was on a dance floor in Buenos Aires. Which I don’t suppose you will remember either. PS: I do...|$|E

6000|$|... "Just this," [...] {{her voice}} almost a whisper. [...] "I am frightened of it all, {{and when you}} want me I will come to you. No, wait just a little. I could never marry {{the man who was}} {{fighting}} against my father and the people I belong to, while, now I know what you are, I could never ask him to go back on what he felt was right; but, Larry, the men you did so <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>have</b> turned against you, and the things they are doing are not right, and would never please you. Can't we go away and leave the trouble behind us? Nobody seems to want us now." ...|$|R
