50|$|The first {{potentiometric}} titration {{was carried out}} in 1893 by Robert Behrend at Ostwald's Institute in Leipzig. He titrated mercurous solution with potassium chloride, potassium bromide, and potassium iodide. He used a mercury electrode along with a mercury/mercurous nitrate reference electrode. He found that in a cell composed of <b>mercurous</b> <b>nitrate</b> and mercurous nitrate/mercury, the initial voltage is 0. If potassium chloride is added to <b>mercurous</b> <b>nitrate</b> on one side, mercury (I) chloride is precipitated. This decreased the osmotic pressure of mercury (I) ions on the side and creates a potential difference. This potential difference increases slowly as additional potassium chloride is added, but then increases more rapidly. He found the greatest potential difference is achieved once all of the <b>mercurous</b> <b>nitrate</b> has been precipitated. This was used to discern end points of titrations.|$|E
40|$|Brass {{cartridge}} {{cases are}} tested for tensile residual stresses by <b>mercurous</b> <b>nitrate</b> immersion {{in accordance with}} ASTM B 154. The test {{has been used for}} many years as an accelerated, lot acceptance test to detect tensile residual stresses that, when combined with a corrosive media, can cause stress corrosion cracking during long-term storage. This is often called �season cracking� of brass. However, regulatory standards, disposal cost and employee exposure issues justify the need to replace the <b>mercurous</b> <b>nitrate</b> test in an expedient manner. The 30 -minute test involves immersing the test specimens in <b>mercurous</b> <b>nitrate</b> solution. At the end of the test, the mercury-coated samples are inspected for cracks under low-power optical microscope. The presence of cracks would indicate that the part contains enough tensile residual stress to make it susceptible to stress corrosion cracking. The drawback with this test is related to the disposal of the mercury coated test specimens and the mercury contaminated solutions. With the inception of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) new clean air standards in September 2003, in particular Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards, the disposal of mercury has been affected. The disposal cost has become increasingly prohibitive. When the final MACT standards take effect in 2005, the remaining disposal sites for mercury may become noncompliant. Despite waste minimization efforts, mercury-contaminated waste is still generated with the current test method. Several possible replacements for <b>mercurous</b> <b>nitrate</b> have been identified. The objectives of the <b>mercurous</b> <b>nitrate</b> replacement tests are: �	Provides timely results. �	To be less hazardous to personnel and the environment. �	To be implemented in current production environments, preferably using existing facilities. An accelerated ammonia vapor test has been successfully demonstrated and is being scaled up to accommodate facility test quantities. An accelerated ammoniacal copper sulfate has also been successfully demonstrated. The proposed replacement test(s) will be tested alongside the current <b>mercurous</b> <b>nitrate</b> test method to ensure that results correlate strongly. The proposed replacement tests will be less hazardous to the environment and personnel, will reduce the cost of lot acceptance testing, and will comply with increasingly stringent environmental regulatory requirements.

40|$|Laboratory {{investigations}} {{were carried}} out on C 68700 copper alloy heat-exchangers tubes to study the effect of stress relieving annealing at different temperature and time to prevent SCC phenomena. The analysis includes metallographic characterizations, <b>mercurous</b> <b>nitrate</b> tests and residual stress measurements by X-ray microdiffraction. A significant decrease of residual stresses was registered after standard annealing at 250 °C; similar results were obtained at 200 °C for longer time demonstrating the opportunity to achieve a good stress-relief also at lower temperature...|$|E

40|$|The impetus {{given the}} search for a non-polluting, {{stress-corrosion}} cracking test for brass cartridge cases to replace the conventional <b>mercurous</b> <b>nitrate</b> test, developed from recent discussions among per-sonnel of the Small Caliber Ammnitions Branch and the Metals Forming and Processing Branch. Precedent information was found insufficient to permit Imediate substantiation of potentially useful alternates. A project was established (#F 628098 (J 74), AMCMS 4110. 16. 0217. 8. 06. 02) for the purpose of accessing non-polluting substitute tests. An earlier evaluative study was made by the Metals Forming and Processing Branch, using 5. 56 mm brass cases subjected to ammonia vapor and to Mattsson's Solution (141 SO 4 + CuSO 4). The results in-dicated the need for further discrimination and evaluation of poten-tially substitutive methods.

40|$|A simple technique, using solvent {{extraction}} and {{thin layer chromatography}} for the detection and separation {{of a number of}} commonly prescribed veterinary drugs was studied. Blood and urine have been considered as possible biological samples taken from the animals. The extraction of each sample was done according to the type of the drug as it is acidic or basic, then the extract was spotted on TLC plate by capillary tube after lining the starting line first. Separations of the components of the samples were developed after running the plate in a tight lid tank containing solvent (mobile phase). The identification of separated spots were carried out after lining the end line for the solvent front then by spraying the plate with <b>mercurous</b> <b>nitrate</b> reagent for acidic drugs and acidic iodoplatinate or potassium permanganate reagent for basic drugs.
