5000|$|<b>Meat</b> <b>thermometers</b> {{are usually}} {{designed}} {{to have the}} probe in the meat during cooking. Some use a bimetallic strip which rotates a needle which shows the temperature on a dial; the whole thermometer can be left inside the oven during cooking. Another variety commonly used on turkey is the pop-up timer, which uses a spring held in by a soft material that [...] "pops up" [...] when the meat reaches a set temperature.|$|R
50|$|Thermometers are {{important}} in food safety where food at temperatures within 41 and 135 F can be prone to potentially harmful levels of bacterial growth after several hours {{which could lead to}} foodborne illness. This includes monitoring refrigeration temperatures and maintaining temperatures in foods being served under heat lamps or hot water baths.Cooking thermometers {{are important}} for determining if a food is properly cooked. In particular <b>meat</b> <b>thermometers</b> are used to aid in cooking meat to a safe internal temperature while preventing over cooking. They are commonly found using either a bimetallic coil, or a thermocouple or thermistor with a digital readout.Candy thermometers are used to aid in achieving a specific water content in a sugar solution based on its boiling temperature.|$|R

40|$|To reduce {{consumer}} health risks from foodborne diseases {{that result from}} improper domestic food handling, consumers {{need to know how}} to safely handle food. To realize improvements in public health, it is necessary to develop interventions that match the needs of individual consumers. Successful intervention strategies are therefore contingent on identifying not only the practices that are important for consumer protection, but also barriers that prevent consumers from responding to these interventions. A measure of food safety behavior is needed to assess the effectiveness of different intervention strategies across different groups of consumers. A nationally representative survey was conducted in the Netherlands to determine which practices are likely conducted by which consumers. Participants reported their behaviors with respect to 55 different food-handling practices. The Rasch modeling technique was used to determine a general measure for the likelihood of an average consumer performing each food-handling behavior. Simultaneously, an average performance measure was estimated for each consumer. These two measures can be combined to predict the likelihood that an individual consumer engages in a specific food-handling behavior. A single ¿food safety¿ dimension was shown to underlie all items. Some potentially safe practices (e. g., use of <b>meat</b> <b>thermometers)</b> were reported as very difficult, while other safe practices were conducted by respondents more frequently (e. g., washing of fresh fruit and vegetables). A cluster analysis was applied to the resulting data set, and five segments of consumers were identified. Different behaviors may have different effects on microbial growth in food, and thus have different consequences for human health. Once the microbial relevance of the different consumer behaviors has been confirmed by experiments and modeling, the scale developed in the research reported here can be used to develop risk communication targeted to the needs of different consumer groups, as well as to measure the efficacy of different interventions.

50|$|The {{best way}} to prevent {{trichinellosis}} is to fully cook <b>meat.</b> A food <b>thermometer</b> can verify that the temperature inside the meat is high enough. Infection is typically treated with antiparasitic medication such as albendazole or mebendazole. Rapid treatment may kill adult worms and thereby stop further worsening of symptoms. Both medications are considered safe but {{have been associated with}} side effects such as bone marrow suppression. Their use during pregnancy or in {{children under the age of}} 2 years is poorly studied but appears to be safe. Treatment with steroids is sometimes also required in severe cases. Without treatment symptoms typically resolve within three months.|$|R
40|$|Broiling {{is cooking}} tender {{cuts of meat}} by radiant heat from hot coals, a gas flame, or an {{electric}} element. Steaks and chops for broiling are from 1 to 2 inches thick. Broiling {{as a method of}} cooking mat is not new, but the directions for the process are the result of individual trial and error testing and are often in conflict. Current interest in indoor and outdoor broiling, particularly in Western United States, emphasizes the need for better information. There is no measuring device for surface heat during broiling and thus little research on the relationship of surface temperature, degree of doneness and cooking time. Little has been done to investigate the effect of a change in rate of heat transfer on the physical and chemical reactions which occur during broiling. Although some work has been done on the effects of different cooking methods on weight losses, tenderness, palatability, and thiamine content of beef, no reports were found relating cut of meat, temperature at the surface of the mat, and degree of doneness to other factors during broiling. The existing literature contained relatively little information on changes produced in broiled beef. Most of the data available were indefinite, lacking precise information regarding time and temperature. Timetables for broiling, like roasting, varied in directions given and frequently stated the time of cooking in minutes per pound. At best this can serve only as a poor guide because the amount of fat and bone present, the state of the meat, whether solid or ground, the amount of connective tissue present, and the thickness of the meat influence the rate of heat penetration. This initial study was conducted on beef using charcoal as the source of heat, since the heat of the charcoal could be controlled at different temperatures. A high, medium and low temperature were used for cooking and the meat was cooked to three degrees of doneness (rare, medium and well-done). In this research a potentiometer devised by Taylor Instrument Company to measure the temperature at the surfaces of the meat and internally was used. Thus it was possible to accurately measure the temperature. An experimental model of a coil-type thermometer was also made by Taylor Instrument Company and its use offered, for the first time, the possibility of determining the temperature at the surface of the meat. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the relationship of surface temperature during broiling to stage of doneness and to cooking time on the following factors in broiled sirloin steaks: thiamine retention, soluble protein content, weight loss, moisture retention, changes in tenderness, juiciness and flavor. It was hoped that the findings might be of use in the development of a thermometer to be used for broiling much as oven and <b>meat</b> <b>thermometers</b> are used now for roasting meats. Also, an attempt was made to develop time-temperature charts for use in broiling...|$|R
50|$|A 2012 chicken meat {{study found}} 60% of home cooks {{were at risk}} of food {{poisoning}} by washing whole poultry before it was cooked, which can spread bacteria around the kitchen.

40|$|A hand injury {{occurred}} at a U. S. facility in 1985 involving a pointed shaft (similar to a <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer)</b> that a worker was using to remove scrap solid plutonium from a plastic bottle. The worker punctured his right index finger on the palm side at the metacarpal-phalangeal joint. The wound was not through-and- through, although it was deep. The puncture wound resulted in deposition of ~ 48 kBq of alpha activity from the weapons-grade plutonium mixture with a nominal 12 to 1 Pu-alpha to {sup 241 }Am-alpha ratio. This case clearly showed that DTPA was very effective for decorporation of plutonium and americium. The case is a model for management of wounds contaminated with transuranics: (1) a team approach for dealing {{with all of the}} issues surrounding the incident, including the psychological, (2) early surgical intervention for foreign-body removal, (3) wound irrigation with DTPA solution, and (4) early and prolonged DTPA administration based upon bioassay and in vivo dosimetry...|$|E
40|$|Field {{procedures}} for collecting soil cores and soil {{samples from the}} steam injection plot were modified {{in an effort to}} minimize VOC losses that can occur when sampling soil at elevated temperatures (Battelle, 2001). The primary modifications included: (1) additional personnel safety equipment, such as thermalinsulated gloves for core handling; (2) the addition of a cooling period to bring the soil cores to approximately 20 ºC before collecting samples; and (3) capping the core ends while the cores were cooling. Concerns were raised about the possibility that increased handling times during soil coring, soil cooling, and sample collection may result in an increase in VOC losses. An experiment was conducted using soil samples spiked with a surrogate compound to investigate the effectiveness of the field procedures developed for LC 34 in minimizing VOC losses. Materials and Methods Soil cores were collected in a 2 -inch diameter, 4 -foot long acetate sleeve that was placed tightly inside a 2 -inch diameter stainless steel core barrel. The acetate sleeve was immediately capped on both ends with a protective polymer covering. The sleeve was placed in an ice bath to cool the heated core to below ambient groundwater temperatures (approximately 20 ºC). The temperature of the soil core was monitored during the cooling process with a <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer</b> that was pushed into one end cap (see Figure G- 1). Approximately 30 minutes was required to cool each 4 -foot long, 2 -inch diameter soil core from 50 - 95 ºC to below 20 ºC (see Figure G- 2). Upon reaching ambient temperature, the core sleeve was then uncapped and cut open along its length to collect the soil sample for contaminant analysis (see Figure G- 3) ...|$|E
