40|$|BACKGROUND: The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) {{vaccine is}} {{provided}} to over 100 million neonates annually {{to protect against}} childhood tuberculosis (TB). Recent BCG manufacturing interruptions highlight global supply risks. We estimated {{the potential impact of}} BCG shortfalls on global paediatric (< 15  years) TB mortality. METHODS: A static mathematical model was employed to estimate the number of paediatric TB deaths avoided by usual levels of BCG coverage, and potential additional TB deaths in the first 15  years of life due to 1 -year BCG supply shortfalls of 6. 3  % (as occurred in 2015) to 27. 6  % (as anticipated without mitigating action in 2015) assuming no catch-up campaigns. RESULTS: BCG coverage without shortfalls, estimated at 90  % globally, was estimated to avoid 117, 132 (95  % uncertainty range (UR) : 5049 - 306, 911) TB deaths globally per birth cohort in the first 15  years of life. An estimated 11, 713 (UR: 505 - 30, 691) additional TB deaths would occur in the first 15  years of life per 10  % (26 <b>million</b> <b>dose)</b> annual supply shortfall. A 16. 5 <b>million</b> <b>dose</b> (6. 3  %) shortfall as reported at the close of 2015, reflecting 84  % global coverage, was estimated as associated with 7433 (95  % UR: 320 - 19, 477) excess TB deaths in the affected cohort in the first 15  years. A possible 24, 914 (UR: 1074 - 65, 278) additional deaths were avoided due to prompt shortfall reduction measures in 2015. CONCLUSIONS: BCG shortages could greatly increase paediatric TB mortality. Although rapid action in 2015 minimised BCG shortfalls, avoiding a large number of potential additional deaths, the possible public health impact of even relatively small shortfalls highlights the critical importance of ensuring secure future manufacturing capacity and global BCG supply continuity...|$|R

25|$|In 1927, {{scientists}} {{isolated the}} {{yellow fever virus}} in West Africa. Following this, two vaccines were developed in the 1930s. The vaccine 17D {{was developed by the}} South African microbiologist Max Theiler at the Rockefeller Institute in New York City. This vaccine was widely used by the U.S. Army during World War II. Following the work of Ernest Goodpasture, Theiler used chicken eggs to culture the virus and won a Nobel Prize in 1951 for this achievement. A French team developed the French neurotropic vaccine (FNV), which was extracted from mouse brain tissue. Since this vaccine was associated with a higher incidence of encephalitis, FNV was not recommended after 1961. Vaccine 17D is still in use, and more than 400 <b>million</b> <b>doses</b> have been distributed. Little research has been done to develop new vaccines. Some researchers worry that the 60-year-old technology for vaccine production may be too slow to stop a major new yellow-fever epidemic. Newer vaccines, based on vero cells, are in development and should replace 17D at some point.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{controversy}} surrounding failed batches of polio vaccine threatened to destroy public {{faith in the}} Federal health establishment. After the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis sponsored a successful national trial of Jonas Salk's vaccine in Ann Arbor, Michigan (1954), PHS had released licensing standards for the vaccine and approved six manufacturers to begin production. Scheele and Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (DHEW) Secretary Oveta Culp Hobby released this long-awaited news {{at a press conference}} on April 12, 1955, the tenth anniversary of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's death from complications of polio. Health departments around the country administered over 10 <b>million</b> <b>doses,</b> 90 percent to elementary school-aged children, until weeks into the public health campaign, reports came in of fresh cases among vaccinated children and their contacts. Amid growing public furor, Scheele took action. On April 27 he requested that one of the manufacturers, Cutter Laboratories, recall its vaccine and he created a new Poliomyelitis Surveillance Unit at the Communicable Disease Center (CDC) and a national infrastructure for case reporting from the states. During May Scheele halted the national campaign until the remaining vaccines were cleared. Relative scarcity of the vaccine created public health crises of another sort: most vaccinations were held off until autumn, giving CDC time enough to evaluate the revised safety regulations but also leading to a political falling out between Hobby and the United States Congress.|$|E
500|$|Fiona Measham, a criminologist at The University of Lancaster, {{thought the}} {{emergence}} of mephedrone was also related to the decreasing purity of ecstasy and cocaine on sale in the UK, a view reinforced in {{a report by the}} National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse. The average cocaine purity fell from 60% in 1999 to 22% in 2009 and about half of ecstasy pills seized in 2009 contained no MDMA, and by June 2010 almost all ecstasy pills seized in the UK contained no MDMA. A similar pattern was observed in the Netherlands, with the number of ecstasy tablets containing no MDMA rising from 10% in mid-2008 to 60% by mid-2009, with mephedrone being detected in 20% of ecstasy tablets by mid-2009. The decrease of MDMA was thought to be partly due to the seizure of 33tonnes of sassafras oil, the precursor to MDMA, in Cambodia in June 2008, which could have been used to make 245 <b>million</b> <b>doses</b> of MDMA. According to John Ramsey, a toxicologist at St George's, University of London, {{the emergence of}} mephedrone was also related to the UK government banning the benzylpiperazine class of drugs in December 2009. gamma-Butyrolactone (GBL), another previously [...] "legal high", was also banned in August 2009 despite concerns it would be replaced by other drugs.|$|E

40|$|In {{the fall}} of 2004, the United States faced a {{national}} shortageof influenza vaccine after a major vaccine manufacturerwas unable to produce <b>millions</b> of <b>doses</b> of the vaccine due to potential contamination. Many public and private sector entities had far fewer doses of influenza vaccine to allocate than they had anticipated. In response, federal, state, and local public health officials, private vaccine distributors, and healthcare providers collaborated to distribute available doses of influenza vaccine. However, the existing legal framework through which allocations were made is murky. This article examines major legal issues regarding allocation strategies involving limited supplies of influenza vaccines, addressing in particular (1) existing legal requirements for allocating and distributing influenza vaccines among public health authorities and healthcare providers at the federal, state, and local levels; (2) the legal capacity of public health authorities to acquire existing vaccine supplies from healthcare providers; and (3) specific legal responses implemented by states {{in response to the}} 2004 – 2005 influenza vaccine shortage.
