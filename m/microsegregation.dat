The distribution of Cu, Mg and Li in, for example, Al alloy 8091 showed surprisingly pronounced macrosegregation with the variation of Cu(wt%) in a spray formed 8091 billet, ranging from approximately 1.4 at the billet centre to 1.92 at the billet periphery. These macrosegregation patterns were explained in terms of inverse segregation in which solute rich liquid from the billet centre is sucked back through the primary Al-rich network to feed solidification shrinkage at the billet periphery. This effect was suggested to be exacerbated by centrifugal effects from the billet rotation.|$|E

40|$|Although iron {{is usually}} added in die cast Al-Si foundry alloys to prevent die soldering, primary Fe-rich {{particles}} are generally considered as "hardspot" inclusions which compromise the mechanical {{properties of the}} alloy, namely ductility and toughness.

Single-layer and bulk 316 L SLM experiments are presented that reveals the forming mechanism of these sub-grain cellular microstructures. Complex cellular sub-micron patterns were formed by the local convection and Bénard Instabilities in front of the solid/liquid (S/L) interface (so-called mushy zones) affected by intricate temperature and surface tension gradients.

40|$|As {{a result}} of high cooling rates during the direct chill casting process of Al-Mn-Mg-Fe-Si alloys (typically AA 3 xxx series) Mn and Fe are {{quenched}} in a solid solution, due to their slow diffusion kinetics. Therefore the as-cast condition is far from thermodynamic equilibrium. One of the main goals of the industrial process of pre-heating is to precipitate Mn and Fe and to eliminate <b>microsegregations.</b> During heating of the as-cast ingot up to homogenisation temperature a variety of phases develop. Each of this phases can change its composition and its amount. From a metallurgical point of view the process is mainly dominated by nucleation, growth, dissolution and transformation of AlMn-dispersoids {{as well as other}} phases. In this work a statistical model was developed to describe this process within the framework of classical nucleation theory and the kinetics of growth and coarsening of precipitates. The ClaNG model (Classical Nucleation and Growth) predicts the precipitation kinetics during annealing 1 xxx, 5 xxx and in particluar 3 xxx series alloys. The model is capable of describing the simultaneous nucleation, growth, coarsening and compositional changes of several types of spherical precipitates. To calculate the equilibrium phases, the chemical driving forces and the equilibrium concentrations, the commercial Gibbs energy minimizer ChemApp (GTT Technologies, Herzogenrath, Germany) and thermodynamic databases have been embedded. The main advantage of this strategy is that there is nearly no restriction on a special alloy system. The present algorithm is fast and therefore of particular interest for industrial applications. The experimental work focused on structural investigations of the influence of each alloying element. For a detailed characterisation of the metallurgical processes that determine microstructure evolution during pre-heating of an as cast-ingot, isothermal heat treatments with model alloys (AlMn 1 Mg 1, AlMn 1 Mg 1 Fe 0. 45 and AlMn 1 Mg 1 Fe 0. 45 Si 0. 2) as well as commercial AA 3104 alloy in combination with real process data for pre-heating were carried out to validate the model...|$|R

40|$|A <b>microsegregation</b> model, {{based on}} a {{boundary}} layer concept, is proposed for solidiÞcation of alloys. The model is derived by considering Þnite-rate solute di¤usion both in the liquid and in the solid.

This new parameter is the liquid counterpart of the solutal Fourier number in the solid phase used before to characterize Þnite-rate back-di¤usion in the solid.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} is to assess the {{tendency}} of alloying elements to macro- and <b>microsegregation</b> during hot-forging and successive thermomechanical rolling of medium-Mn Al-bearing steel sheets. Design/methodology/approach: The macro- and <b>microsegregation</b> of alloying elements was assessed by EDS and WDS measurements across {{the thickness of the}} roughly-forged flats and thermomechanically processed 3. 3 mm sheets. The microstructure was revealed using combined methods of optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Morphological features of microstructural constituents were discussed with focusing on retained austenite. Findings: It was found that the final multiphase microstructure is mainly dependent on the Mn content and the effect of Nb microaddition is relatively low. The 3 Mn steels possess very fine bainite-based microstructures whereas the steels containing 5 % Mn are characterized by lath bainitic-martensitic microstructures. All the steels contain retained austenite as fine granules or layers located between bainitic ferrite laths. Some fraction of martensite-austenite (M-A) islands was also identified. The tendency of Mn and Al to macrosegregation was found after the initial hot-forging. It disappears after successive rough and thermomechanical rolling whereas thin martensite and martensite-austenite microbands as a result of Mn <b>microsegregation</b> locally occur. Research limitations/implications: Further investigations are required to quantify the local changes of chemical composition especially in formed microbands and X-ray quantitative phase analysis should be applied to assess a fraction of retained austenite.
