5|$|Like Trollope before him, Pope Hennessy took {{rooms at}} The Shannon Hotel, {{near the river}} and set about trying to {{capture the essence of}} the town which had {{inspired}} Trollope's first novel, The Macdermots of Ballycloran. He proved to be a very popular figure in the town, evidenced {{by the fact that he}} was asked to adjudicate at a local beauty pageant and the horse fair. Pope Hennessy gives particular <b>mention</b> <b>to</b> the Corcoran family, the proprietors of The Shannon Hotel in the 1960s and 1970s, for their help in the production of his work.

5|$|Davis fell in {{love with}} Sarah Knox Taylor, {{daughter}} of his commanding officer, future president Zachary Taylor. Both Sarah and Davis sought Taylor's permission to marry. Taylor refused, as he did not wish his daughter to have the difficult life of a military wife on frontier army posts. Davis's own experience led him to appreciate Taylor's objection. He consulted with his older brother Joseph, and they both began to question the value of an Army career. Davis hesitated to leave, but his desire for Sarah overcame this, and he resigned his commission in a letter dated April 20, 1835. He had arranged for the letter to be sent to the War Department for him on May 12 when he did not return from leave; he had made no <b>mention</b> <b>to</b> Taylor of his intention to resign. Against his former commander's wishes, on June 17, he married Sarah in Louisville, Kentucky. His resignation became effective June 30.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} North American {{calendar of}} the ELCA {{was different from}} its European counterparts in {{that it does not}} give equal weight (and sometimes gives no <b>mention)</b> <b>to</b> persons who may be commemorated in Scandinavian regions. One example would be the absence of St. Lucia on December 13, although she enjoys particular popularity in Sweden. But Lutheran calendars also differ amongst one another in North America, with some individuals commemorated on multiple calendars but on different days (e.g., St. Bernard of Clairvaux on August 19 in the LCMS and August 20 in the ELCA) or individuals commemorated on one calendar and not the other (e.g., Martin Luther King, Jr. on January 15 for the ELCA and C. F. W. Walther on May 7 for the LCMS); with the 2006 publication of Evangelical Lutheran Worship (ELW) as a replacement to the Lutheran Book of Worship (LBW), some of these deficiencies in the ELCA calendar have been corrected. Within the ELCA, This Far by Faith and Libro de Liturgia y Cantico both prescribe calendars with additional commemorations specific to the ethnic communities they were intended to be used in (African Americans and Latinos respectively). The Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod has a different, somewhat minimized calendar when compared the LCMS and especially the ELCA.|$|E

This you will permit me to do now, without any reserve, in the fear and in the presence of God.|$|E
25|$|In a {{statement}} to the public, Libien Tella rejected the OFAC's findings and denied any connections with Mexican drug cartels. He invited U.S. officials to closely examine Unomásuno {{and the rest of his}} businesses, and stated that his newspapers were critical of drug trafficking groups for years, including Los Cuinis and the CJNG. In the report, he mentioned Unomásuno, Diario Amanecer, and Aerolineas Amanecer, but gave no <b>mention</b> <b>to</b> his investment group Valgo Grupo de Inversión. He stated that it was likely that Mexican officials wanted to censor Unomásunos anti-organized crime publications by providing U.S. officials with false information to link them to drug trafficking and thereby discredit their information. He concluded his statement by saying that he was open to sharing information on his businesses because the accusations affected his integrity.|$|E

25|$|After Kilroy was {{confirmed}} dead, the media framed the drug group and their religious practices as satanist. For the most part, the U.S. media labeled {{the group as}} satanist and gave little <b>mention</b> <b>to</b> the drug-related violence that was widespread in northern Mexico, thus failing to provide a wider picture of what happened at Matamoros. Reports concluded that because human body parts were found inside a large metal pot, the group practiced cannibalism. Some journalists made the error of attributing cannibalism with the common mistake of satanist groups sacrificing and eating human remains. Other writers, however, stated that Constanzo believed in Kadiempembe, the devil's version in Palo Mayombe. In addition, some occult writers believed {{that the nature of}} Kilroy's murder, which included mutilation and clandestine burial, were part of occult tradition.|$|E
25|$|Connauton {{began his}} junior {{career in the}} AJHL with the Spruce Grove Saints in 2007–08. He {{recorded}} 13 goals and 45 points over 56 games – first among rookie defencemen and third among defencemen overall – to earn a {{rookie of the year}} nomination and a unanimous selection to the AJHL North All-Rookie Team. He garnered interest from the Vancouver Giants of the WHL, who put him on their protected list in October 2008, but opted to play college hockey instead in the NCAA. He signed with the Western Michigan Broncos of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) in April 2008 and initially intended to join them for the 2009–10 season, due to an already full defensive corps. However, after Jesse Perrin departed for the Central Hockey League (CHL) in August 2008, Connauton was invited to join the Broncos for the 2008–09 season. He went on to record a 7-goal, 18-point campaign as a freshman to earn an honourable <b>mention</b> <b>to</b> the CCHA All-Rookie Team.|$|E
25|$|Shōnen Sekai was {{mentioned}} various times in many English novels. In the novel The New Japanese Women: Modernity, Media, and Women in Interwar Japan mentioned Shōnen Sekai in the notes to chapter 3 {{as one of}} many magazines that Hakubunkan made to relate to different parts of society. Daily Lives of Civilians in Wartime Asia: From the Taiping Rebellion to the Vietnam War also mentioned Shōnen Sekai as a popular magazine of that time, with an additional <b>mention</b> <b>to</b> Shōjo Sekai, its female equivalent. Issei: Japanese Immigrants in Hawaii mentioned Shōnen Sekai as just a publication of Hakubunkan. In the novel No Sword to Bury: Japanese Americans in Hawai'i During World War II had mention of Shimanuki Hyotayu who writes about immigration matters in Shōnen Sekai. Shōnen Sekai was also mentioned in both The Similitude of Blossoms: A Critical Biography of Izumi Kyōka (1873–1939), Japanese Novelist and Playwright and Japan's Modern Myths: Ideology in the Late Meiji Period.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{increasing}} fatalities at the Atlantic Branch's 50 grade crossings, a {{law was passed}} from the City of Brooklyn and the City of New York to remove grade crossings in 1897. As part of the law, a tunnel would have been built to Lower Manhattan, {{but because of the}} large cost, it was removed in 1900. Work commenced in December 1901, after {{a new version of the}} law was passed on April 8, 1901 without any <b>mention</b> <b>to</b> the tunnel. The portion from Flatbush Avenue to Bedford Avenue the line was to be a tunnel, and the portion from Nostrand Avenue to Ralph Avenue was to be elevated. The next section, between Ralph Avenue and Howard Avenue was to be built as a tunnel, and the remaining portion to Atkins Avenue would have been an elevated structure. The first portion of the line to be opened was between Manhattan Crossing and Atkins Avenue. This portion opened on May 28, 1903, and the second part, the elevated from Nostrand Avenue to Ralph Avenue, opened on November 23. to Manhattan Crossing, The first tunnel segment, the one between Ralph Avenue and Howard Avenue, opened in 1904. Because of delays resulting in the construction of the new Flatbush Avenue terminal, service to the new underground Flatbush Avenue did not commence until November 5, 1905. Prior to the opening of the underground station, trains used a connection with the Brooklyn Rapid Transit's Fifth Avenue Elevated and temporary wooden platforms were built on the connection. The new terminal opened on April 1, 1907. The easternmost elevated section of the line was replaced by a tunnel around the year 1940.|$|E
500|$|The killing was {{reported}} on 1 July 2009 in German {{radio and television}} and in print media on the following day. In line with common practice regarding reporting in the German media about crime and legal proceedings, El-Sherbini {{was referred to as}} [...] "32-year old" [...] witness in a Deutschlandfunk report broadcast on 1 July, without any <b>mention</b> <b>to</b> the victim's ethnic or religious background. The Minister of Justice for Saxony, Geert Mackenroth, who had visited the crime scene on the same day, publicly expressed his [...] "deep compassion for the victim's family, for the victim herself". Another politician called for an investigation and the Association of Judges in Saxony (Sächsischer Richterbund) demanded a review of security procedures in court buildings.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} argued that some kind of {{fortification}} was probably constructed at Gibraltar thereafter. According to the 13th century Kurdish historian Ali ibn al-Athir, Tariq built a fort on The Rock, but this was [...] "only for temporary use, and after he had captured the area of Algeciras, he abandoned it... He descended from the mountains to the desert tract and conquered Algeciras and other places, and he abandoned the fort which was in the mountain." [...] The [...] "fort" [...] probably consisted of no more than a look-out post on the Rock to observe movements in and around the bay during the period of landing; there would have been little need for anything more substantial (as better landing points such as Algeciras or Tarifa were in his hands), and Tariq would not have had the manpower to construct a sizeable fortification. No <b>mention</b> <b>to</b> a permanent occupation of Gibraltar is found in Arab or Christian chronicles, nor archaeological evidence is found until the 12th century.|$|E

500|$|Afterwards, Jack's {{secretary}} tells Liz that Jack {{wants her}} to apologize, but {{that she has to}} pretend that it was her idea. Liz goes to Jack's office and apologizes, and they forgive each other. While the staff eats their lunch, Jack introduces the staff to two of his guests. The writers <b>mention</b> <b>to</b> Liz that they would love to go outside to the same roof that is used for The Today Show, and Liz tells them that she can make it happen now that she and Jack are friends. Liz asks Jack, but he denies the request. He tells her that the two guests were his bosses from GE, and then criticizes Liz and her staff. He apologizes to Liz, but she says that their friendship is over. Having settled the situation with Jack, Liz tries to talk to her assistant Cerie about her attire, which seems to distract the writers. Liz attempts to convince her to wear something conservative, but Cerie tells Liz that she would look great in something sexy herself, and Liz is later seen walking down the hallway with a dress that reads [...] "Dirty Diva".|$|E
500|$|... "The Jacket" [...] {{was written}} by Seinfelds co-creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones. The episode's storyline was based on one of David's personal experiences; when he was dating Monica Yates, {{she wanted him to}} meet her father, Richard Yates, a respected novelist. David had just bought a suede jacket, and met Richard Yates at the Algonquin Hotel. Richard was, as David stated in an interview, [...] "...every bit as intimidating as Alton Benes". David's story is similar to what happened in the episode, as, when they headed out to the restaurant, his jacket was ruined by the snow. Additional dialogue at the store where Jerry buys his jacket was cut before broadcast, it featured a reference to Gary Gilmore. The material was later included on the Seinfeld Volume 1 DVD set. [...] "The Jacket" [...] is the only episode in which one of Elaine's parents appears; Louis-Dreyfus once suggested Mary Tyler Moore to portray Elaine's mother, but the character never appeared on the show. The episode also contains the first <b>mention</b> <b>to</b> Elaine's job as a manuscript reader for Pendant Publishing, in early drafts of the script her job was an optician. Also in early drafts, in the final scene Kramer entered Jerry's house with a dove on his shoulder.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times Neil Genzlinger {{said that}} the funny script and skilled editing {{potentially}} made it the [...] "Animal House of the iPhone generation". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised the film for updating the clichés of similarly themed films from the 1970s to the 1980s like Animal House and Risky Business [...] "so that they look just dangerous enough to make nostalgia feel naughty", but stated that the film does not offer anything more outrageous than real parties, despite implying [...] "that it's breaking down bold new barriers of misbehavior". Gleiberman accused negative reviews of [...] "fulfilling the role of all those uptight parents in '50s news reports {{about the dangers of}} rock & roll", by applying moral judgments to the events of the film. Time Out Joshua Rothkopf gave the film four stars out of five, calling it [...] "brainless", but feeling that the sheer anarchy of the film's events were [...] "thrilling". Pete Travers of Rolling Stone praised the film as [...] "gut-bustingly funny" [...] that appealed to a base youth element to become [...] "shitfaced and run amok", and said that it puts its own spin on Animal House. Travers gave particular <b>mention</b> <b>to</b> Mann as [...] "excellent"; however, he also stated that Nourizadeh's filmmaking was a [...] "disaster".|$|E
