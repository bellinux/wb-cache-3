The Dietary Guidelines for Americans and other expert groups recommend that adults and children reduce their sodium intake to less than 2, 300 <b>milligrams</b> of <b>sodium</b> a day (1 teaspoon of salt has about 2, 400 <b>milligrams</b> of <b>sodium).</b> Further reductions to 1, 500 milligrams or less per day are recommended for older adults (51 and older), African Americans of any age, and individuals with high blood pressure, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease.

Stricter regulations of sodium content for foods served in restaurants and processed foods from grocery stores have not been forthcoming, but some companies have announced voluntary steps to reduce sodium in foods and menu items as part of a voluntary collaboration known as that National Salt Reduction Initiative (NSRI) which is coordinated by the New York City Health Department.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{examined}} {{approaches to}} reduce sodium content of food served in settings operated or {{funded by the}} government of the County of Los Angeles, California.

We used data provided by county government food-service vendors to generate these simulations. RESULTS: Our analysis predicted that if the postulated sodium-reduction strategies were implemented, adults would consume, on average, 233 fewer <b>milligrams</b> of <b>sodium</b> each day.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} {{of positive and}} negative Mg- 26 anomalies in inclusions of the Allende meteorite is explained in terms of proton bombardment of a gas of solar composition. A significant fraction of Mg- 26 in the irradiated gas is stored temporarily in the form of radioactive Al- 26 by the reaction Mg- 26 (p, n) Al- 26. Proton fluxes of 10 to the 17 th power to 10 to the 19 th power protons per square centimeter per year at 1 million electron volts are inferred. Aluminum-rich materials condensing from the gas phase have positive Mg- 26 anomalies, whereas magnesium-rich materials have negative Mg- 26 anomalies. The proton flux required to account for the observed magnesium anomalies is used to investigate possible isotopic anomalies in the elements from oxygen to argon. Detectable isotopic anomalies are predicted only for neon. The anomalous neon is virtually pure Ne- 22 from Na- 22 decay.

5000|$|Medical {{nutrition}} therapy: {{based on}} a diet with the correct energy intake and balance of proteins {{that will be used}} in synthesis processes and not as a source of calories. A total of 35 kcal/kg body weight/day is normally recommended. This diet should also comply with two more requirements: the first is to not consume more than 1 g of protein/kg body weight/ day, as a greater amount could increase the degree of proteinuria and cause a negative nitrogen balance. Patients are usually recommended lean cuts of meat, fish, and poultry. The second guideline requires that the amount of water ingested is not greater than the level of diuresis. In order to facilitate this the consumption of salt must also be controlled, as this contributes to water retention. It is advisable to restrict the ingestion of sodium to 1 or 2 g/day, which means that salt cannot be used in cooking and salty foods should also be avoided. Foods high in sodium include seasoning blends (garlic salt, Adobo, season salt, etc.) canned soups, canned vegetables containing salt, luncheon meats including turkey, ham, bologna, and salami, prepared foods, fast foods, soy sauce, ketchup, and salad dressings.
