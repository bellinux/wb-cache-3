5|$|The <b>marine</b> <b>engineer</b> {{and amateur}} {{historian}} Anders Franzén had searched for old Swedish wrecks in the Baltic since the 1940s and became nationally renowned after he located Vasa in 1956. Kronan {{was one of}} several famous shipwrecks on a list of potential wreck sites that he had compiled. For almost 30 years Franzén and others scoured archives and probed the seabed off the west coast of Öland. During the 1950s and 1960s the team searched off Hulterstad by dragging, and later followed up with sonar scans. In 1971 planks believed to belong to Kronan were located, but the lead could not be followed up properly at the time. Later in the 1970s the search area was narrowed down with a sidescan sonar and a magnometer, an instrument that detects the presence of iron. With the two instruments the team pinned down a likely location, and in early August 1980, sent down underwater cameras to reveal the first pictures of Kronan.|$|E
5|$|Best's mother, Mona Best (born Alice Mona Shaw), {{was born}} in Delhi, India, and was the {{daughter}} of Thomas (an Irish major) and Mary Shaw. Randolph Peter Scanland (later surnamed Best), her first child, {{was born in}} Madras (now Chennai), Madras Presidency, British India, on 24 November 1941. Best's biological father was <b>marine</b> <b>engineer</b> Donald Peter Scanland, who subsequently died during World War II. Best's mother was training to become a doctor {{in the service of the}} Red Cross when she met Johnny Best, who came from a family of sports promoters in Liverpool who ran Liverpool Stadium. During World War II, Johnny Best was a commissioned officer serving as a Physical Training Instructor in India, and was the Army's middleweight boxing champion. After their marriage on 7 March 1944 at St Thomas's Cathedral, Bombay, Rory Best was born. In 1945, the Best family sailed for four weeks to Liverpool on the Georgic, the last troop ship to leave India, carrying single and married soldiers who had previously been a part of General Sir William Slim's forces in south-east Asia. The ship docked in Liverpool on 25 December 1945.|$|E

25|$|John Penn FRS (1805–1878) was an English <b>marine</b> <b>engineer</b> whose {{firm was}} {{pre-eminent}} {{in the middle}} of the 19th century due to his innovations in engine and propeller systems, which led his firm to be the major supplier to the Royal Navy as it made the transition from sail to steam power.

25|$|James Balfour, at {{the time}} <b>marine</b> <b>engineer</b> to the Otago Provincial Council and later to the Colonial Government of New Zealand, was {{commissioned}} during 1863 to design the lighthouse.

Balfour had trained under Stevenson's brothers David and Thomas Stevenson. In 1848, Balfour's older sister Maggie had married Thomas Stevenson, hence the Stevensons were his brothers-in-law.|$|E

The marine and land crews picked up debris from the eleven islands, putting refuse in bags and carting it away after they had removed some forty tons of varied refuse: refrigerator doors, tires, kitchen sinks, mattresses, and an abandoned boat.|$|E
25|$|The last formal {{inspection}} in 1992 revealed little {{damage to}} the riveted steel hull; although a single skin hull no longer complies with current regulations, she has been granted an exemption {{on the grounds of}} historical importance. The higher quality of steel produced in 1899 no doubt also played a part - after placing the vessel in a dry dock at Monkey Bay in May 2009, <b>marine</b> <b>engineer</b> Pieter Volschenk concluded that more recently constructed ships looked in worse condition after only twenty years at sea. In January 2012, she was brought ashore for the continuing restoration work.|$|E
25|$|Others who {{consider}} the Bimini undersea formation to be man-made, {{as opposed to}} natural beachrock, are Joseph Manson Valentine, zoologist; Charles Berlitz, linguist; Greg Little, psychologist; R. Cedric Leonard, anthropologist; and Dimitri Rebikoff, French <b>marine</b> <b>engineer.</b> All claim to have investigated the formations in person, and claim to have observed more than one horizontal layer of blocks, at least in places. However, multiple layers of block can result naturally from systematic fracturing of sedimentary rock where multiple layers of sedimentary rock lie on top of each, as {{can be observed in}} the case of the tessellated pavement of Tasmania exposed at Eaglehawk Neck on the Tasman Peninsula.|$|E

25|$|Frederick {{followed}} his father into {{the legal profession}} becoming a solicitor. Frederick married Isabella Penn in 1877, {{the daughter of the}} famous <b>marine</b> <b>engineer,</b> John Penn. This was in the same year that his fellow rugby international and Old Rugbeian, Joseph Fletcher Green, married Isabella's sister Ellen. Thus, he and Joseph were brothers-in-law. They had a number of children including: Frederic Frank Stokes (1880), Alick (1882), Ellen Muriel Stokes (1888), Ellen Sybil Stokes (1891), Ellen Zoe Stokes (1898). Frederick Stokes died on 7 February 1929, at Inhurst House, Baughurst, Berkshire aged 78. Notably, all five of Frederick's brothers were keen sportsmen and all played rugby. One of his brothers, Lennard Stokes, also captained the England national rugby union team.|$|E

Hugh Maccoll, another Scottish young man (Glasgow, 9 June 1861), a <b>marine</b> <b>engineer</b> who at that time had moved to Seville to work as the technical manager of Portilla White foundry, was their first captain.
