25|$|Maize is a {{major source}} of starch. Cornstarch (maize flour) {{is a major}} {{ingredient}} in home cooking and in many industrialized food products. Maize is also {{a major source of}} cooking oil (corn oil) and of maize gluten. <b>Maize</b> <b>starch</b> can be hydrolyzed and enzymatically treated to produce syrups, particularly high fructose corn syrup, a sweetener; and also fermented and distilled to produce grain alcohol. Grain alcohol from maize is traditionally the source of Bourbon whiskey. Maize is sometimes used as the starch source for beer. Within the United States, the usage of maize for human consumption constitutes about 1/40th of the amount grown in the country. In the United States and Canada, maize is mostly grown to feed livestock, as forage, silage (made by fermentation of chopped green cornstalks), or grain. Maize meal is also a significant ingredient of some commercial animal food products, such as dog food.|$|E
50|$|Starch from {{waxy maize}} differs from regular <b>maize</b> <b>starch</b> in both {{molecular}} structure and pasting characteristics. Pastes made from waxy starch {{are long and}} cohesive, whereas pastes made from regular <b>maize</b> <b>starch</b> are short and heavy bodied. Waxy <b>maize</b> <b>starch</b> is a major starch component in adhesives used for making bottle labels. This waxy starch-based adhesive imparts resolubilizing resistance to the labels which prevents their soaking off the bottle if immersed in water or being subjected to very high humidity conditions. Moreover, waxy maize starches are commonly used in the US for the manufacture of gummed tapes and envelope adhesives.|$|E

The melting process of waxy and normal <b>maize</b> <b>starches</b> could be described {{by means of a}} `two-state' model. The melting process of the <b>maize</b> <b>starches,</b> which contained at least 50 % (w/w) amylose, were described as the melting of a mixture of low and high temperature populations of double-helical type crystallites, denoted as B- and B*-type, as well as the melting of V-type crystallites. The relative amounts of the three structures were determined by deconvolution of the calorimetric peaks. The values of the melting co-operative units (ν) and the thickness of crystalline lamellae (pitch heights) for low (waxy and normal) and high amylose starches were determined using a mathematical model describing the melting process. The ν in A- and B-type crystals were calculated as 13. 7 ± 1. 7 and 30. 6 ± 5. 0 glucose units, respectively.

Regression analyses indicated that all damaged starch in the dry wheat and <b>maize</b> <b>starches</b> was amorphous. Order in damaged <b>maize</b> <b>starches</b> could be restored by wetting and drying the damaged starches. On wetting, the damaged portions of the granules comprised soluble material and swollen gel that were quantified together as damaged starch using an enzymic assay. The undamaged portion comprised surviving native starch granules and birefringent remnants of larger granules that had been partially damaged. Both the enthalpy and temperature of gelatinisation of the starches, and of the recovered native granules plus remnant material, decreased with increasing levels of starch damage. Starches isolated from millstreams showed {{the same pattern of}} behaviour. A model is presented to explain the observed patterns of damage.

40|$|Extrusion {{processing}} of cereal starch granules with high (> 50 %) amylose content is a promising approach to create nutritionally desirable resistant starch, i. e. starch that escapes digestion {{in the small}} intestine. Whilst high amylose content seems to be required, the structural features responsible for the slow digestion of extrudates are not fully understood. We report the effects of partial enzyme digestion of extruded <b>maize</b> <b>starches</b> on amylopectin branch length profiles, double and single helix contents, crystallinity and lamellar periodicity. Comparing results for three extruded <b>maize</b> <b>starches</b> (27, 57, and 84 % apparent amylose) that differ in amylase-sensitivity allows conclusions to be drawn concerning the rate-determining features operating under the digestion conditions used. Enzyme resistance is shown to originate {{from a combination of}} molecular and mesoscopic factors, including both recrystallization and an increase in very short branches during the digestion process. This is in contrast to the behaviour of the same starches in the granular form (Shrestha et al., 2012) where molecular and mesoscopic factors are secondary to microscopic structures in determining enzyme susceptibility. Based on the structure of residual material after long-time digestion (> 8 h), a model for resistant starch from processed high amylose <b>maize</b> <b>starches</b> is proposed based on a fringed micelle structure with lateral aggregation and enzyme susceptibility both limited by attached clusters of branch points.

40|$|The amylase {{digestibility}} of high-amylose <b>maize</b> <b>starches</b> {{has been}} compared before and after thermo-mechanical processing. Starches were analysed for enzyme-resistant starch yield, apparent amylose content, crystallinity (X-ray diffraction), and molecular order (NMR and FTIR), {{both before and after}} treatment with (x-amylase. All samples had significant (> 10 %) enzyme-resistant starch levels irrespective of the type and extent of thermal or enzymic processing. Molecular or crystalline order was not a pre-requisite for enzyme resistance. Near-amorphous forms of high amylose <b>maize</b> <b>starches</b> are likely to undergo recrystallisation during the enzyme-digestion process. The mechanism of enzyme resistance of granular high-amylose starches is found to be qualitatively different to that for processed high-amylose starches. For all samples, measured levels of enzyme resistance are due to the interruption of a slow digestion process, rather than the presence of completely indigestible material. © 2008, Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Hydroxypropylation {{was carried}} out on heat-moisture treated (HMT) wheat, potato and waxy <b>maize</b> <b>starches.</b> Hydroxypropylation {{increased}} swelling factor and amylose leaching of both native and HMT starches. Hydroxypropylation of HMT starches reduced enthalpies of gelatinization and amylopectin retrogradation more than for the corresponding non-HMT hydroxypropylated starches. This indicates that heat-moisture treatment increases the derivatization of amylopectin. Disruption and reorientation of amylopectin double helices during heat-moisture treatment could facilitate the access of reaction reagent to the highly ordered crystalline regions resulting in greater derivatization. Cold paste viscosity was greatly increased with high pasting stability when hydroxypropyl groups were introduced to HMT wheat and potato starches. Alkaline treatment increased gelatinization temperature of all the starches but enthalpy was unaffected. Amylose leaching and swelling factor greatly increased in wheat but decreased in potato and waxy <b>maize</b> <b>starches</b> with alkaline treatment. This increased amylose leaching and swelling factor along with greater reduction of amylose-lipid complex endotherm of wheat starch by alkaline treatment {{is consistent with the}} disruption of amylose-lipid complex. The amylose-lipid complex is susceptible to hydrolysis in alkaline conditions. Heat-moisture treatment had no influence on transition parameters of amylose-lipid complex. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods A range of <b>maize</b> <b>starches</b> were compared: digestible cornstarch (Control), HYLON ® VII, Hi-maize ® 1043, Hi-maize ® 240, Hi-maize ® 260 and NOVELOSE ® 330. Included in the comparison was Cellulose. End-points after 4 weeks included: pH, short chain fatty acids (SCFA) levels, colonic epithelial cell kinetics and apoptotic response to carcinogen 'azoxymethane' in the colonic epithelium. Results The RS diets significantly increased SCFA and reduced pH in caecal content and faeces. Hi-maize 260 resulted in the highest butyrate concentrations. All RS diets prevented the mucosal atrophy as seen in the rats fed the Control diet. Epithelial cell turnover was increased in the Control and Cellulose groups compared to the Hi-maize 260, HYLON VII and NOVELOSE 330 groups (P Conclusion The consumption of RS elicits a range of beneficial physiological and protective effects associated with the fermentation of RS. Increased production of butyrate seems a likely explanation by which RS enhances the apoptotic response to carcinogen-induced DNA damage which is consistent with the proposed role of this SCFA in promoting a normal cell phenotype and preventing the development of abnormal cell populations. </p...|$|R

Thirty-eight types of human colonic bacteria were screened for their capacity to utilize soluble starch, gelatinized amylopectin <b>maize</b> <b>starch,</b> and high-amylose <b>maize</b> <b>starch</b> granules by measuring the clear zones on starch agar plates. The six cultures which produced clear zones on amylopectin maize starch- containing plates were selected for further studies for utilization of amylopectin <b>maize</b> <b>starch</b> and high-amylose <b>maize</b> <b>starch</b> granules A (amylose; Sigma) and B (Culture Pro 958 N). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to detect bacterial starch-degrading enzymes.
