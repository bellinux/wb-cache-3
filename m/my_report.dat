Moshansky, who {{investigated}} the crash in Dryden {{and wrote the}} report, appeared in the documentary, alleging that if the recommendations in his report had been followed, the USAir accident could have been prevented. Moshansky told the documentary that his report [...] "probably sat on somebody's [...] desk." [...] He said [...] "when I first heard about it I thought, my God, it's Dryden all over again ... certainly if they had followed the recommendations in <b>my</b> <b>report,</b> the F28 crash at LaGuardia could have been averted." ...|$|E
500|$|Bonham's Case {{was deeply}} unpopular with the Crown; Coke {{was removed from}} the Common Pleas and sent to the King's Bench, in theory a more senior office but in {{practice}} a less rewarding one in 1613. In June 1616, he was suspended from office and ordered to [...] "correct" [...] his case reports. In October 1617, James I demanded an explanation from Coke of the reasoning behind Bonham's Case. Coke claimed that [...] "the words of <b>my</b> <b>report</b> do not import any new opinion, but only a relation of such authorities of law, as had been adjudged and resolved in former times, and were cited in the argument of Bonham's case". He refused to admit to any flaws with his writings, and his only corrections were minor errors and rearrangements of the language. If he meant the case as an endorsement of judicial review instead of Parliamentary sovereignty, withdrawal of that endorsement has been inferred from his later writings.|$|E
