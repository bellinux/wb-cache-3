5000|$|After she {{received}} Billboards Artist of the Decade Award and the World Music Award for Best-Selling Female Artist of the Millennium in 2000, Carey parted from Columbia Records {{and signed a}} record-breaking $100 million five-album recording contract with Virgin Records America America (EMI). She often stated that Columbia had regarded her as a commodity, with her separation from Tommy Mottola exacerbating her relations with label executives. Just a few months later, in July, 2001, it was widely reported that Carey had suffered a physical and emotional breakdown, and her relationship with the Latin icon Luis Miguel ended. In an interview the following year, she said, [...] "I was with people who didnt really know me and I had no personal assistant. Id do interviews all day long and get two hours of sleep a night, if that." [...] Carey began posting a series of disturbing messages on her official website, and displayed erratic behavior on several live promotional outings. On July 19, 2001, Carey made a surprise appearance on the MTV program Total Request Live (TRL). As the shows host Carson Daly began taping following a commercial break, Carey came out pushing an ice cream cart while wearing a large <b>mens</b> <b>shirt,</b> and began a striptease, in which she shed her shirt to reveal a tight yellow and green ensemble. While she later revealed that Daly was aware of her presence in the building prior to her appearance, Careys appearance on TRL garnered strong media attention.|$|R

In most countries it is expected that Men remove their caps when indoors and Ladies keep their hats on whether indoors or out. However, there has been a decline in recent years of both men and women wearing headdress. It is likely in coming years that the cap and hat will be phased out.|$|R

50|$|<b>Men</b> wearing red <b>shirts</b> {{appeared}} in Charleston, South Carolina on August 25, 1876, during a Democratic torchlight parade.

The red shirt symbolism quickly spread. Suspects accused in the Hamburg Massacre wore red shirts as they marched on September 5 to their arraignment in Aiken, South Carolina.

50|$|Although {{the first}} cufflinks {{appeared}} in the 1600s, they did not become common {{until the end of}} the 18th century. Their development is closely related to that of the men's <b>shirt.</b> <b>Men</b> have been wearing shirt-like items of clothing since the invention of woven fabric 5,000 years BC. Although styles and methods of manufacturing changed, the underlying form remained the same: a tunic opened to the front with sleeves and collar. The shirt was worn directly next to the skin, it was washable and thereby protected the outer garments from contact with the body. Conversely, it also protected the skin against the rougher and heavier fabrics of jackets and coats by covering the neck and wrists.|$|R
