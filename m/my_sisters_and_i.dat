60|$|It {{came to me}} indeed as I {{stood on}} her door-step that as she had a son she might not after all be so lone; yet I remembered {{at the same time}} that Jasper Nettlepoint was not quite a young man to lean upon, having--as I at least supposed--a life of his own and tastes and habits which had long since {{diverted}} him from the maternal side. If he did happen just now to be at home my solicitude would of course seem officious; for in his many wanderings--I believed he had roamed all over the globe--he would certainly have learned how to manage.

I could trust her at any time to tell people I was respectable. Perhaps I was conscious of how little I deserved this indulgence when it came over me that I hadn't been near her for ages. The measure of that neglect was given by my vagueness of mind about Jasper. However, I really belonged nowadays to a different generation; I was more the mother's contemporary than the son's.|$|E

50|$|Muliro loved music {{right from}} a tender age.

She says. Even then, Muliro hadn’t {{realized that she had}} a ministry in her. It wasn’t until 2001 that she responded to the call of God, and began music as a career. It wasn’t an easy start since she was gripped by fear and very low self-esteem, which affected the sound of her voice, and she almost gave up singing, as she sounded horrible.“At that time I learnt how to tell it to God as it is and as I gave Him all my fears and struggles, He granted me the strength and Grace” says Muliro. “I also drew a lot of inspiration from established artistes, among them the late Angela Chibalonza, the Iconic Gospel legend”. She adds. Muliro joined the worship team of Maranatha Faith Assemblies, where she was a member. It is then that Rolland Esese and the late Stanely Mtambo introduced her to live band music and walked her through the training.|$|E

40|$|Christmas {{was special}} because my mother, brothers, {{and sisters and}} their {{children}} all came {{from around the country}} to our home. Our Christmas dinner was festive.

The mashed potatoes were the crowning addition to the Christmas dinner feast. They were our mother’s love turned into fluffy white mounds. It was an extravagant idea but I decided to serve them from a Waterford crystal pedestal bowl that had been a farewell gift to us some years ago. Until that day, it had only held flower-petal potpourri. But now on Christmas Day, how those mashed potatoes glittered splendidly in the Waterford crystal bowl! Dinner was wonderful. We ate, talked, laughed and ate some more. Very little was left {{at the end of the}} meal. <b>My</b> <b>sisters</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> chatted and washed up the dishes afterwards.

40|$|Nature {{has been}} a part of my life since I was very young. I can {{remember}} playing outside in our tree house and finding berries in the woods to eat. <b>My</b> <b>sisters</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> would have races through the corn fields and sled down the snow covered hills, which at the time seemed like mountains. I cannot imagine not having the outdoors be a part of my life. Nature has helped shape me into who I am and it has truly become a part of me. It is scary to know that not all children are getting to experience nature in the way that I did. Through reading and observation, I have come to realize that not everyone is like me, my family, or the children I baby-sit. Some children do not go for hikes or spend Sunday afternoons exploring the areas of trees at the edge of the property. I have lived in a bubble my whole life, seeing only rural areas and country kids. I have not been around children who would not jump at the chance to go outside and jump on the trampoline or play kick ball in the back yard. Having said this, I feel I am the lucky one. Nature allows children to play stress free. They do not have to lower their voices or follow any rules. It allows children to be who they really are. I look at nature as essential to good health. I come from a very big family who is, for the most part, very healthy. I know this is a stretch, but maybe, seeing as we spend so much tim...|$|E

40|$|My {{mother was}} {{diagnosed}} with the early-onset form of Alzheimer’s {{at the age of}} fifty-four. At the time, she could not recite her birthday, let alone describe important events in her life because the disease had already robbed her of her ability to convey details. Slowly, my father, <b>my</b> <b>sisters,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have taken on the domestic responsibilities my mother had usually completed, while simultaneously learning to care for a woman unable to care for herself. The “old-timer’s” disease alienates those diagnosed by creating a living reminder that one’s mind is susceptible to failing. Generally believed {{to be one of the}} most feared diseases in theUnited States, it affects millions of people around the world and holds the same place in cultural mindsets as cancer did forty years ago as a “family matter” that should be taken care of in the home and let run its course. The concept of “Alzheimer’s” is so ominous and unapproachable that, perhaps, a way to cope is to vilify the disease (as a scoundrel), not the people afflicted by it. Memory Thief is by no means a manual for dealing with Alzheimer’s, but a narrative to battle the stereotypes that this is an “old-timers” problem and life ends with the diagnosis. The narrative blends humor and heartache to illustrate how this is a complex illness of intense emotional and physical loss, walking contradictions, false hopes, mistaken identities, guilt-ridden laughs, simple pride, and sleepless nights. The same question always remains: Will this be her last time? And, more selfishly, how much longer will she remember me? Is this the year she forgets her friends, her family, her daughters, her husband? Thankfully, she has not yet lost her sense of humor. She still responds to old comedies with a hearty, contagious kind of laugh that emanates from the soul. This is what she should be remembered for, and not as a victim of the scoundrel who stole her memories. Adviser: Joy Castr...|$|E

40|$|My name is Katharina Marchant and I am {{currently}} pursuing my MFA in Photography at Utah State University. I have a Bachelor 2 ̆ 7 s in Painting and Criminal Justice from UNLV. My {{work has}} always been a study of society and culture. From moving every two years of my life I experienced many different societies and find the differences fascinating, especially when an individual is never accepted by his surrounding culture. My paintings were studies of {{what it meant to be}} from Wyoming, a state I lived in for some middle school, high school, and some of college. I also created work about American children growing up in Berlin during the 19802 ̆ 7 s and 902 ̆ 7 s. I found inspiration for this work in the beginning line of a film. In 2 ̆ 7 A River Runs Through It, 2 ̆ 7 the main character Norman begins his narration by reminiscing, 2 ̆ 2 Long ago, when I was a young man, my father said to me, 2 ̆ 2 Norman, you like to write stories. 2 ̆ 2 And I said 2 ̆ 2 Yes, I do. 2 ̆ 2 Then he said, 2 ̆ 2 Someday, when you 2 ̆ 7 re ready you might tell our family story. Only then will you understand what happened and why. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 2 I began to consider how I would write my story, photograph my story, and create my story. I did not grow up near family in the sense that many people do. I did not have the opportunity to visit my grandparents during the summer or have lunch with an uncle periodically. Often my family lived a few countries away. My family became the squadron my father was assigned. Often members of this squadron moved to the same base over and over again. The children in these military families became my family members. I started thinking about my family, the dynamic of family, the culture of my family. My family was strange. When asked, 2 ̆ 2 Oh, where are you from? 2 ̆ 2 my father could respond without hesitation, 2 ̆ 2 I 2 ̆ 7 m from Elizabethtown Pennsylvania. Born, bred, and Amish fed! 2 ̆ 2 When <b>my</b> <b>sisters</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> were asked the same question we tripped over our words. We scrambled for the correct answer. My father was so proud of being an American but for <b>my</b> <b>sisters</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> the only tie to America we had was a piece of paper confirming our citizenship. Because of this division of 2 ̆ 2 from-ness 2 ̆ 2 in our lives, <b>my</b> <b>sisters</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> found comfort in the fact we were not alone. Our family, our Air Force, our military family, created their own culture, their own home. We became from wherever the Air Force sent us. Just as families are traditionally from a single spot on the globe, my friends and I are from cylinder brick homes with barely enough room to fit a five person family. We are from abandoned military posts, demolished bases, and forgotten instillations. We have our own nomadic subculture that allows us to view the world from the outside and from within. We are Americans but we are also America 2 ̆ 7 s forgotten children she doesn 2 ̆ 7 t claim. We spent years of our lives dedicated to America. Traveling from base to base, our fathers leaving for months on end in the name of America often without notice, dealing with the stress of war, parents dying, parents living, parents divorcing, we are the dedicated invisible soldiers who often never see America until our teen years. Often the only contact to America a Brat has is through the P. O. Box. Every other day my mother would pack us kids up. We would drive through town, through the German streets, past the statues of the Kaiser, past fields, cows, and finally onto the American base. We would wait, often impatiently; while my mother opened the box. Once open we would receive America. Letters from the government, taxes, absentee ballots, advertisements, and letters from American relatives we never had met. Sometimes my mother would save cereal box tops and send for prizes, we would then receive America 2 ̆ 7 s Tony the Tiger. It was America. All this mail was grand but nothing compared to the highly anticipated and cherished J. C. Penny catalog. Now this surely was what it meant to be American. Basketball, Arizona Jeans, Barbie and G. I. Joe was no doubt as American as the apple pie I had never tasted. We lived in a German world. Us Military Brats were born in Germany, spoke German, wore German clothing. Often our mothers were German, we ate German food, watched German television, but for a few hours while we were on the American base we were American. While driving on the base, while flipping through the J. C. Penny catalog we were American children. America Through a P. O. Box is 2. 5 x 3 feet and created on stretched canvas. There are ten layers to complete the image. The work is a mixed media piece that consists of paint, paper, transferred photographic images, and caulk. The base layer consists of paint and tissue paper. Paint and photographic images transferred with caulk and acrylic paint are layered on and scrapped off repeatedly. I react to the canvas instinctively while layering the middle ground. The final images are transferred with clear caulk to create the finished work. This specific piece had 7 photographs systematically applied and reduced. The upper images the viewer sees are of the P. O. Boxes and the Kaiser. The construction process of my work was inspired from the work of the Constuctivists. These artists utilized various mediums to achieve a singular concept. The Constructivists are considered early developers of photomontage which inspired painters and photographers to combine various mediums. The work of Alexander Rodchenko, Joseph Beuys, Jane Hammond, and Max Penson has specifically influenced my mixed media and photography work. The lifestyle and culture of a Military Brat is so difficult to understand or convey that the abstract nature of mixed media is desired. I created this work originally in a traditional photographic sense but the work was lacking in the emotional understanding of the Military Brat 2 ̆ 7 s situation. To fill this hole of understanding, or lack of understanding, I utilize gestural movements in the piece through addition and reduction of information to convey this sense of emotion. To grow up from country to country, state to state, and never given permission by natives to belong is a strange way of living, but the military child prevails in this situation. Over the next few years I plan to show this complete body of work around the world in towns near military instillations. My goal is to create understanding, respect, and recognition for these children. By displaying this work in civilian towns near military bases I plan to create a cultural tie between these two separate groups of individuals. There are moments and memories in our lives we label as important, life altering. By receiving mail from America and living moments on an American installation the military child has confirmation of their American-ness. The child also needs to be aware of their global-ness. The child grows to be a citizen of the world and not only America or the country of origin. A Military Brat 2 ̆ 7 s eyes perceive the world from the inside and outside of a culture. This unique opportunity should be recognized and respected...|$|E
