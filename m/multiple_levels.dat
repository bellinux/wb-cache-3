5|$|Environmental {{sociology}} is {{the study}} of human interactions with the natural environment, typically emphasizing human dimensions of environmental problems, social impacts of those problems, and efforts to resolve them. As with other sub-fields of sociology, scholarship in environmental sociology may be at one or <b>multiple</b> <b>levels</b> of analysis, from global (e.g. world-systems) to local, societal to individual. Attention is paid also to the processes by which environmental problems become defined and known to humans. As argued by notable environmental sociologist John Bellamy Foster, the predecessor to modern environmental sociology is Marx's analysis of the metabolic rift, which influenced contemporary thought on sustainability. Environmental sociology is often interdisciplinary and overlaps with the sociology of risk, rural sociology and the sociology of disaster.|$|E
5|$|There are <b>multiple</b> <b>levels</b> of {{metabolic}} regulation. In intrinsic regulation, {{the metabolic}} pathway self-regulates {{to respond to}} changes in the levels of substrates or products; for example, a decrease in the amount of product can increase the flux through the pathway to compensate. This type of regulation often involves allosteric regulation of the activities of multiple enzymes in the pathway. Extrinsic control involves a cell in a multicellular organism changing its metabolism in response to signals from other cells. These signals are usually in the form of soluble messengers such as hormones and growth factors and are detected by specific receptors on the cell surface. These signals are then transmitted inside the cell by second messenger systems that often involved the phosphorylation of proteins.|$|E

At each level of the hierarchical decision problem different multiple criteria ranking sub-problems have been structured and solved with the application of AHP method, ELECTRE III/IV method and their combination (AHP/ELECTRE III/IV). Thus, the computational phase allowed for testing the above mentioned multiple criteria ranking methods, i. e. : AHP and ELECTRE III/IV and analyzing their suitability for performing a <b>multiple</b> <b>level,</b> <b>multiple</b> criteria evaluation of transportation projects. Due to axiomatic differences between methods alternative aggregation formulas of the generated rankings by ELECTRE III/IV and AHP methods have been proposed.

40|$|This paper {{serves as}} a review of our recent new DNS study on physics of late {{boundary}} layer transition. This includes mechanism of the large coherent vortex structure formation, small length scale generation and flow randomization. The widely spread concept vortex breakdown to turbulence,which was considered as the last stage of flow transition, is not observed and is found theoretically incorrect. The classical theory on boundary layer transition is challenged and we proposed a new theory with five steps, i. e. receptivity, linear instability, large vortex formation, small length scale generation, loss of symmetry and randomization to turbulence. We have also proposed a new theory about turbulence generation. The new theory shows that all small length scales (turbulence) are generated by shear layer instability which is produced by large vortex structure with <b>multiple</b> <b>level</b> vortex rings, <b>multiple</b> <b>level</b> sweeps and ejections, and <b>multiple</b> <b>level</b> negative and positive spikes near the laminar sub-layers. Therefore, turbulence is not generated by vortex breakdown but rather positive and negative spikes and consequent high shear layers. Shear layer instability is considered {{as the mother of}} turbulence. This new theory may give a universal mechanism for turbulence generation and sustenance which shows that the energy is brought by large vortex structure through <b>multiple</b> <b>level</b> sweeps.

5|$|A social {{rational}} for the Hindu {{concept of}} rebirth in Hell {{is evident in}} the metric work of the Manusmrti: a written discourse focused on the “law of the social classes”. A large portion of it is designed to help people of the Hindu faith understand evil deeds (pätaka) and their karmic consequences in various hellish rebirths. The Manusmrti, however, does not go into explicit detail of each hell. For this we turn to the Bhagavata Purana. The Manusmrti lists <b>multiple</b> <b>levels</b> of hell in which a person can be reborn into. The punishments in each of these consecutive hells is directly related the crimes (pätaka) of the current life and how these deeds will effect the next reincarnation during the cycle of Saṃsāra This concept provides structure to society in which crimes have exacting consequences. An opposite social facet to these hellish rebirths is the precise way in which a person can redeem oneself from a particular crime through a series of vows (such as fasting, water purification rituals, chanting, and even sacrifices). These vows must take place during the same life cycle that the crimes were committed in. These religious lessons assist the societal structure by defining approved and unapproved social behavior.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a short review of our recent DNS work on physics of late {{boundary}} layer transition and turbulence. Based on our DNS observation, we propose a new theory on boundary layer transition, which has five steps, that is, receptivity, linear instability, large vortex structure formation, small length scale generation, loss of symmetry and randomization to turbulence. For turbulence generation and sustenance, the classical theory, described with Richardson's energy cascade and Kolmogorov length scale, is not observed by our DNS. We proposed a new theory on turbulence generation that all small length scales are generated by “shear layer instability” through <b>multiple</b> <b>level</b> ejections and sweeps and consequent <b>multiple</b> <b>level</b> positive and negative spikes, but not by “vortex breakdown. ” We believe “shear layer instability” is the “mother of turbulence. ” The energy transferring from large vortices to small vortices is carried out by <b>multiple</b> <b>level</b> sweeps, but does not follow Kolmogorov's theory that large vortices pass energy to small ones through vortex stretch and breakdown.
