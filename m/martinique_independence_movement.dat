50|$|The {{importation}} {{of the term}} unionism into the Spanish context and its usage with pejorative meaning {{is related to the}} nationalist attempts to introduce the terminology of the Irish republican <b>movement,</b> the English <b>independence</b> <b>movement,</b> the Scottish <b>independence</b> <b>movement,</b> and Welsh <b>independence</b> <b>movement</b> to the Galician <b>independence</b> <b>movement,</b> the Basque <b>independence</b> <b>movement,</b> and the Catalan <b>independence</b> <b>movement.</b> In this way, Spanish unionism is considered by Galician, Basque, and Catalan nationalist parties as a political ideology identified by its denial of the exercise of the right of self-determination of the peripheral nationalities of Spain or sometimes by the simple defense of Spain as a nation. Therefore, the label has been applied to parties such as the People's Party, Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) (however sometimes PSOE is seen as more sympathetic to Spain's nationalist movements), Union, Progress and Democracy (UPYD) and Citizens-Party of the Citizenry (C's).|$|R
