The bound-state DSs exhibit a rectangular spectrum profile accompanied by high-contrast <b>modulated</b> <b>fringes</b> on the top. The pulse duration of DSs is estimated as similar to 3. 6 ps and the pulse-pulse separation is similar to 30 ps. The propagation dynamics of the bound-state DSs are further investigated by utilizing single-mode fiber with different lengths. It is found that the pulses can be compressed to similar to 208 fs and subsequently broadened linearly along the extracavity fiber, while the pu separation between the two bound-state DSs remains constant.

40|$|Deep imaging in turbid media such as {{biological}} tissue is challenging due to scattering and optical aberrations. Adaptive optics {{has the potential}} to compensate the tissue aberrations. We present a wavefront sensing scheme for multi-photon scanning microscopes using the pulsed, near-infrared light reflected back from the sample utilising coherence gating and a confocal pinhole to isolate the light from a layer of interest. By interfering the back-reflected light with a tilted reference beam, we create a fringe pattern with a known spatial carrier frequency in an image of the back-aperture plane of the microscope objective. The wavefront aberrations distort this fringe pattern and thereby imprint themselves at the carrier frequency, which allows us to separate the aberrations in the Fourier domain from low spatial frequency noise. A Fourier analysis of the <b>modulated</b> <b>fringes</b> combined with a virtual Shack-Hartmann sensor for smoothing yields a modal representation of the wavefront suitable for correction.

It seemed most likely that these distorted regions were transitional carbon-containing phases. Distortions due to dislocation networks were shown to be unlikely in this case. EFTEM investigation revealed a fairly uniform distribution of carbon in the HPT steel that corresponds well with our previous results about total cementite dissolution as a result of HPT, although some small carbon enrichments were seen, which may correspond to the distorted phases observed by HRTEM...|$|R

The diffusion in the direction perpendicular to the fibers of microinjected fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextrans of molecular weight ranging from 9500 to 150, 000 was examined by <b>modulated</b> <b>fringe</b> pattern photobleaching. On the time scale of the observation, 10 - 30 S, all of the dextrans were completely mobile in the cytoplasm. The diffusion coefficients were compared to the values obtained in water. The ratio D(cytoplasm) /D(w) decreased with the hydrodynamic radius R(h) of the macromolecules. The mobility of inert molecules in muscle cells is hindered by both the crowding of the fluid phase of the cytoplasm and the screening effect due to myofilaments: D(cytoplasm) /D(w) = (D/D(w)) protein crowding x (D/D(w)) (filament screening). The equation (D/D(w)) filament screening = exp(-K(L) RCh) was used for the contribution of the filaments to the restriction of diffusion.

40|$|The {{diffusion}} of beta-enolase and creatine phosphokinase in muscle cells {{has been studied}} by <b>modulated</b> <b>fringe</b> pattern photobleaching. Beta-enolase is mobile in the sarcoplasm. At 20 degrees C, the diffusion coefficient is 13. 5 +/- 2. 5 microm 2 s(- 1) in the cytosol and 56 microm 2 s(- 1) in aqueous media. As {{in the case of}} dextrans of the same hydrodynamic radius, its mobility is hindered by both the crowding of the fluid phase of the cytoplasm and the screening effect due to myofilaments. A fraction of creatine phosphokinase is mobile in the sarcoplasm. Its diffusion coefficient in the cytosol, 4. 5 +/- 1 microm 2 s(- 1), is lower than that of the dextran of equivalent size. The other fraction (20 to 50 %) is very slightly mobile, with an apparent diffusion coefficient varying from 0. 0035 to 0. 043 microm 2 s(- 1). This low mobility might be attributed to exchange between free and bound creatine phosphokinase.

40|$|<b>Modulated</b> <b>fringe</b> pattern {{photobleaching}} (MFPP) {{was used}} to measure the translational diffusion of microinjected fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -labeled proteins of different sizes in the cytoplasm of cultured muscle cells. This technique, which is an extension of the classical fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) technique, allows the measurement of the translational diffusion of macromolecules over several microns. Proteins used had molecular masses between 21 and 540 kDa. The results clearly indicated that the diffusivity of the various proteins is a decreasing function of their hydrodynamic radius. This decrease is more rapid with globular proteins than with FITC-labeled dextrans (, Biophys. J. 70 : 2327 - 2332), most likely because, unlike globular proteins, dextrans are randomly coiled macromolecules with a flexible structure. These data do not exclude the possibility of a rapid diffusion over a short distance, unobservable with our experimental set-up, which would take place within the first milliseconds after bleaching and would correspond to the diffusion in restricted domains followed by impeded diffusion provoked by the network of microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments. Thus our results may complement rather than contradict those of Verkman and collaborators (, J. Cell Biol. 138 : 1 - 12). The biological consequence of the size-dependent restriction of the mobility of proteins in the cell cytoplasm is that the formation of intracellular complexes with other proteins considerably reduces their mobility...|$|R

The lateral mobility of the fluorescent phospholipids was measured by using {{an extension of the}} classical photobleaching recovery technique that takes advantage of a <b>modulated</b> <b>fringe</b> pattern and provides a high sensitivity. In intact erythrocytes and in ghosts resealed in the presence of ATP, the fluorescence-contrast curves after photobleaching decayed biexponentially corresponding to two lateral diffusion constants. With NBD-phosphatidylcholine, the majority of the signal corresponded to a "slow" component (1. 08 X 10 (- 9) cm 2 /sec at 20 degrees C), whereas with the amino derivatives the majority of the signal corresponded to a "fast" component (5. 14 X 10 (- 9) cm 2 /sec at 20 degrees C). If the ghosts were resealed without ATP, the fast component of the aminophospholipids disappeared. We interpret these results as follows: (i) Provided the cells or the ghosts contain ATP, the three fluorescent phospholipids distribute spontaneously between inner and outer leaflets as endogenous phospholipids, namely NBD-phosphatidylcholine is located in the outer leaflet, while both aminophospholipids are preferentially located in the inner leaflet. (ii) The viscosity of the inner leaflet of human erythrocyte membranes is lower than that of the outer leaflet...|$|R

The fast component only exists in ATP-containing cells. It was shown {{to be associated with}} C 6 -NBD-PtdSer translocated to the inner leaflet.

At higher temperature, the same difference in mobility was observed between the choline-containing lipids and the aminolipid. However, with C 6 -NBD-SphPCho, a fraction of very slowly diffusing or quasi-immobilized probes gradually appeared with time. This could be attributed to sphingomyelin located in small organelles after internalization.

40|$|AbstractNotch (N) and its ligands, Delta (Dl) and Serrate (Ser), are membrane-spanning {{proteins}} with EGF repeats. They play {{an essential}} role in mediating proliferation and segregated differentiation of stem cells. One of the prominent features of N signal system is that its ligands are anchored to the plasma membrane, which allows the ligand/receptor association only between the neighboring cells. Various lines of evidences have verified this intercellular signal transmission, but there also have been implications that expression of Dl or Ser interferes cell-autonomously with the ability of the cell to receive N signal, implying that N and its ligands may interact in the same cell. Here, we demonstrate that N, Dl, and Ser cell-autonomously form homomeric or heteromeric complexes. The cell-autonomous heteromeric complexes are not present on the cell surface, implying that the association occurs in the endoreticulum or Golgi apparatus. Expression of Dl or Ser cell-autonomously reduces the N-mediated HES- 5 promoter activity, indicating that the cell-autonomous association alters the N signal receptivity. Intracellular deletion of Dl shows elevated activity of this dominant-negative effect.

This study examines the distribution of chick lunatic fringe at sites of neural crest formation and explores its possible function by ectopic expression.

Thus, there is a fringe/non-fringe border at the site of neural crest production. Expression of excess lunatic fringe in the cranial neural tube and neural crest by retrovirally mediated gene transfer resulted in a significant increase (∼ 60 %) in the percentage of cranial neural crest cells 1 day after infection.

Lfng overexpression resulted in significantly decreased Th 2 cytokine production in asthma, which was the same effect as the GSI (c-secretase inhibitor) treatment alone, but had an increased effect on Th 1 cytokines than GSI treatment. Collectively, these data identify the essential role of <b>Fringe</b> <b>modulating</b> naı̈ve CD 4 +T cells differentiation through Notch signaling. Lfng regulated Th 2 cells differentiation via a Notch-dependent manner and Th 1 cells differentiation via a Notch-independent manner. Fringe could be a therapeutic strategy for the management and prevention of allergic asthma...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Drosophila {{embryonic}} epidermis {{has been}} a key model for understanding the establishment of cell type diversity across a cellular field. During segmental patterning, distinct signaling territories are established that employ either the Hedgehog, Spitz, Serrate or Wingless ligands. How these pathways control segmental pattern is not completely clear. One major decision occurs as cells are allocated to differentiate either smooth cuticle or denticle type cuticle. This allocation is based on competition between Wingless signaling and Spitz, which activates the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). Here we show that a main role for Serrate-Notch signaling is to adjust the Spitz signaling domain. Serrate accomplishes this task by activating Notch in a discrete domain, {{the main purpose of}} which is to broaden the spatially regulated expression of Rhomboid. This adjusts the breadth of the source for Spitz, since Rhomboid is necessary for the production of active Spitz. We also show that the Serrate antagonist, fringe, must temper Notch activity to insure that the activation of the EGFR is not too robust. Together, Serrate and <b>Fringe</b> <b>modulate</b> Notch activation to generate the proper level of EGFR activation. If Serrate-Notch signaling is absent, the denticle field narrows while the smooth cell field expands, as judged by the expression of the denticle field determinant Ovo/Shaven baby. This establishes one important role for the Serrate signaling territory, which is to define the extent of denticle field specification...|$|R
40|$|How animals {{establish}} {{spatial pattern}} {{is a central}} question in developmental biology. Our objective was to describe the developmental specification and cell biological events that allow coordination of actin-based protrusions, called denticles, to be patterned in the embryonic ventral epidermis of Drosophila melanogaster. To better understand the developmental signals specifying denticle field cell diversity, we characterized molecular events regulating the EGF receptor activation domain. During segmental patterning, distinct signaling territories are established that employ the Hedgehog, Spitz, Serrate or the Wingless ligands. Spitz activates the EGF receptor to yield denticle instead of smooth cell fates. We showed that the main role for Serrate is to adjust the Spitz signaling domain. Serrate activated the Notch receptor in a discrete domain that broadened the expression domain of the protease Rhomboid, which lead to broadening of the Spitz domain. We showed that the Serrate antagonist, Fringe, must temper Notch activity. Together, Serrate and <b>Fringe</b> <b>modulate</b> Notch activation to generate the proper level of EGFR activation. To understand how actin-based denticles are aligned into rows, we characterized the cell morphology and planar cell polarity (PCP) behind denticle patterning. PCP allows cells to coordinate their development {{to that of the}} tissue in which they reside. We showed that cells of the prospective denticle field, but not the adjacent smooth field, align with neighbors and place actin-based protrusions faithfully on their posterior edges. We showed that these aspects of PCP require Myosin II. We observed bipolar Myosin II enrichment across the paraseginent in both smooth and denticle field cells during denticle field alignment. However, smooth field cells appear to lack the proper effectors to uniquely place actin-based protrusions at posterior cell edges. This implicated effectors within the denticle field for roles in unipolar PCP. Lastly, we observed a role for Fringe in the unipolar placement of ABPs. Fringe is expressed solely within the denticle field. Thus, our work provides a link between the conserved developmental signals that lead to denticle specification, and the conserved phenomenon of PCP, which allows coordinated morphological change in the patterning actin based protrusions. ...|$|R
40|$|Estimation of Stokes vector {{components}} from an interferometric fringe encoded {{image is}} a novel way of measuring the State Of Polarization (SOP) distribution across a scene. Imaging polarimeters employing interferometric techniques encode SOP information in a single image {{in the form of}} fringes. The lack of moving parts and the use of a single image eliminates the problems of conventional polarimetry - vibration, spurious signal generation due to artifacts, beam wander and the need for registration routines. However, interferometric polarimeters are limited by narrow band pass operation and short exposure time operations which decrease the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) in the detected image. A simulation environment for designing an Interferometric Stokes Imaging polarimeter (ISIP) and a detector with noise effects is created and presented. A user is capable of imaging an object with defined SOP through an ISIP on to a detector producing a digitized image output. The simulation also includes band pass imaging capabilities, control of detector noise, and object brightness levels. The Stokes images are estimated from a fringe encoded image of a scene by means of a reconstructor algorithm. A spatial domain methodology involving the idea of a unit cell and slide approach is applied to the reconstructor model developed using Mueller calculus. The validation of this methodology and effectiveness compared to a discrete approach is demonstrated with suitable examples. The pixel size required to sample the fringes and the minimum unit cell size required for reconstruction are investigated using condition numbers. The importance of the PSF of fore-optics (telescope) used in imaging the object is investigated and analyzed using a point source imaging example and a Nyquist criteria is presented. Reconstruction of <b>fringe</b> <b>modulated</b> images in the presence of noise involves choosing an optimal sized unitcell. The choice of the unit cell based {{on the size of the}} polarization domain and illumination level is analyzed using a bias-variance tradeoff to obtain the minimum root mean square error. A similar tradeoff study is used to analyze the choice of the band pass filters under various illumination levels. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of the ISIP is presented to explore the applicability of this device to detect low degrees of polarization in areas like remote sensing...|$|R
