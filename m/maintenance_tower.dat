40|$|Abstract- Throughout the years, the {{importance}} of the maintenance management system and their functions has grown rapidly. Cooling towers are used in many process applications in the various industries. Reliability of these towers is crucial. In many cases, redundant towers are installed to ensure a process will not have to be stopped due to a cooling tower failure. The most prevalent cause of cooling tower downtime is failure of bearings, improper water distribution by the nozzles, fan unbalance, failure of the gearbox or associated mechanical components, such as the driveshaft or disc couplings etc. Further, the elimination of these components reduces the losses in the drive system and offers the possibility for improved overall system efficiency. To succeed in the ever-growing competitive global marketplace, it is vital for modem industries to reduce costs related to asset maintenance, repair and replacement, which directly affects the cost of manufactured products. Unplanned downtime results in high maintenance costs. Consequently, improving maintenance efficiency provides substantial benefits to equipments. Cooling <b>tower</b> <b>maintenance</b> considering future uncertainties could improve the efficiencies of the heat transfer processes and as a result, improve the performance of the cooling tower. As a step towards incorporating uncertainties in the cooling tower consideration, this paper presents a cooling <b>tower</b> <b>maintenance</b> methodology including cooling tower trouble shooting with their causes and remedies, preventive maintenance schedule for cooling tower, optimization of cooling tower overhauling activity in maintenance and monitoring technologies. The methodology has been presented, allows the easy maintenance and monitoring of cooling tower with the use of new technology in drive assembly. In this present work we have prepare a preventive maintenance schedule {{on the basis of their}} failure and causes. This increases the utilization of the cooling tower and reduces the uneven breakdown maintenance. Index Terms- cooling <b>tower,</b> <b>maintenance,</b> optimization A I...|$|R

However, one of the challenges in expanding was capitalizing on the location of the airport's neighboring Botanical Garden, creating a beautiful buffer zone between the airport and the outside world.

50|$|A {{climbing}} elevator is a self-ascending elevator {{with its}} own propulsion. The propulsion {{can be done by}} an electric or a combustion engine. Climbing elevators are used in guyed masts or towers, in order to make easy access to parts of these constructions, such as flight safety lamps for maintenance. An example would be the Moonlight towers in Austin, Texas, where the elevator holds only one person and equipment for <b>maintenance.</b> The Glasgow <b>Tower</b> — an observation tower in Glasgow, Scotland — also makes use of two climbing elevators. The ThyssenKrupp MULTI elevator system is based on this principle and it uses a linear motor, like the ones used in maglev trains.|$|R
50|$|On June 2, 1988, a three-member {{broadcast}} <b>tower</b> <b>maintenance</b> {{crew were}} killed when the KTVO transmitter tower collapsed. This forced the channel, along with radio station KRXL-FM 94.5 (which had been renting antenna space on the tower) off-the-air. Since the original tower was still available, KTVO was able to resume broadcasting within thirty hours of the collapse. An Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) investigation placed official blame for the tower collapse primarily on the maintenance crew, citing the removal of too many tower cross-braces at once for repair. Although a relatively new structure, the steel cross-braces had already shown signs of cracking, rust, and other deterioration thus necessitating the early repair and maintenance.|$|R
