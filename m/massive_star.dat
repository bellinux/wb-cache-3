5|$|When helium is {{exhausted}} at {{the core}} of a <b>massive</b> <b>star,</b> the core contracts and the temperature and pressure rises enough to fuse carbon (see Carbon-burning process). This process continues, with the successive stages being fueled by neon (see neon-burning process), oxygen (see oxygen-burning process), and silicon (see silicon-burning process). Near the end of the star's life, fusion continues along a series of onion-layer shells within a <b>massive</b> <b>star.</b> Each shell fuses a different element, with the outermost shell fusing hydrogen; the next shell fusing helium, and so forth.|$|E

5|$|Mass loss {{is one of}} {{the most}} intensively studied aspects of <b>massive</b> <b>star</b> research. Put simply, using {{observed}} mass loss rates in the best models of stellar evolution does not reproduce the observed properties of evolved massive stars such as Wolf–Rayets, the number and types of core collapse supernovae, or their progenitors. To match those observations, the models require much higher mass loss rates. Eta Carinae A has one of the highest known mass loss rates, currently around /year, and is an obvious candidate for study.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory of}} this type of {{supernova}} {{is similar to that of}} novae, in which a white dwarf accretes matter more slowly and does not approach the Chandrasekhar limit. In the case of a nova, the in-falling matter causes a hydrogen fusion surface explosion that does not disrupt the star. This type of supernova differs from a core-collapse supernova, which is caused by the cataclysmic explosion of the outer layers of a <b>massive</b> <b>star</b> as its core implodes.|$|E
5|$|There exist several {{categories}} of Type II supernova explosions, which are categorized {{based on the}} resulting light curve—a graph of luminosity versus time—following the explosion. Type II-L supernovae show a steady (linear) decline of the light curve following the explosion, whereas Type II-P display a period of slower decline (a plateau) in their light curve followed by a normal decay. Type Ib and Ic supernovae are a type of core-collapse supernova for a <b>massive</b> <b>star</b> that has shed its outer envelope of hydrogen and (for Type Ic) helium. As a result, {{they appear to be}} lacking in these elements.|$|E
40|$|Mass loss bridges the {{gap between}} <b>massive</b> <b>stars</b> and supernovae (SNe) in two major ways: (i) {{theoretically}} it {{is the amount of}} mass lost that determines the mass of the star prior to explosion, and (ii) observations of the circumstellar material around SNe may teach us the type of progenitor that made the SN.

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Second World War, Fred Hoyle worked on the problem of how the various observed elements in the universe were produced. In 1946 he proposed that a <b>massive</b> <b>star</b> could generate the necessary thermonuclear reactions, and the nuclear reactions of heavy elements were responsible for the removal of energy necessary for a gravitational collapse to occur. The collapsing star became rotationally unstable, and produced an explosive expulsion of elements that were distributed into interstellar space. The concept that rapid nuclear fusion was the source of energy for a supernova explosion was developed by Hoyle and William Fowler during the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Theoretical studies {{indicate}} that most supernovae are triggered by one of two basic mechanisms: the sudden re-ignition of nuclear fusion in a degenerate star or the sudden gravitational collapse of a massive star's core. In the first instance, a degenerate white dwarf may accumulate sufficient material from a binary companion, either through accretion or via a merger, to raise its core temperature enough to trigger runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting the star. In the second case, {{the core of a}} <b>massive</b> <b>star</b> may undergo sudden gravitational collapse, releasing gravitational potential energy as a supernova. While some observed supernovae are more complex than these two simplified theories, the astrophysical collapse mechanics have been established and accepted by most astronomers for some time.|$|E
5|$|Various {{morphological}} {{features of}} galaxies can affect {{their potential for}} habitability. Spiral arms, for example, are the location of star formation, but they contain numerous giant molecular clouds and a high density of stars that can perturb a star's Oort cloud, sending avalanches of comets and asteroids toward any planets further in. In addition, the high density of stars and rate of <b>massive</b> <b>star</b> formation can expose any stars orbiting within the spiral arms for too long to supernova explosions, reducing their prospects for the survival and development of life. Considering these factors, the Sun is advantageously placed within the galaxy because, {{in addition to being}} outside a spiral arm, it orbits near the corotation radius, maximizing the interval between spiral-arm crossings.|$|E
40|$|Unlike the {{formation}} of Solar-type stars, {{the formation}} of <b>massive</b> <b>stars</b> (M> 8 Msun) is not yet well understood. For Solar-type protostars, the presence of circumstellar or protoplanetary disks which provide a path for mass accretion onto protostars is well established. However, to date only few cases of young <b>massive</b> <b>stars</b> show the evidence of circumstellar disks which {{support the idea that}} a scaled-up version of low-mass star formation could be applied to young <b>massive</b> <b>stars.</b> To what extend this hypothesis can be applied is still unclear and more observational evidences are required to characterize the physical properties of the disk-like structures around <b>massive</b> <b>stars</b> in order to understand how exactly <b>massive</b> <b>stars</b> gain their masses in the equatorial regions. In this thesis, we present high-resolution (sub) millimeter interferometric and single-dish observations of massive star-forming cores. We suggest that <b>massive</b> <b>stars</b> may form via disk accretion in some relatively isolated star-forming cores, while <b>massive</b> <b>stars</b> may form through competitive accretion in the central part of massive star-forming clusters.

5|$|Because of {{the immense}} {{distances}} of most gamma-ray burst sources from Earth, {{identification of the}} progenitors, the systems that produce these explosions, is challenging. The association of some long GRBs with supernovae {{and the fact that}} their host galaxies are rapidly star-forming offer very strong evidence that long gamma-ray bursts are associated with massive stars. The most widely accepted mechanism for the origin of long-duration GRBs is the collapsar model, in which the core of an extremely massive, low-metallicity, rapidly rotating star collapses into a black hole {{in the final stages of}} its evolution. Matter near the star's core rains down towards the center and swirls into a high-density accretion disk. The infall of this material into a black hole drives a pair of relativistic jets out along the rotational axis, which pummel through the stellar envelope and eventually break through the stellar surface and radiate as gamma rays. Some alternative models replace the black hole with a newly formed magnetar, although most other aspects of the model (the collapse of the core of a <b>massive</b> <b>star</b> and the formation of relativistic jets) are the same.|$|E
5|$|NGC 7424 is a barred {{spiral galaxy}} with an {{apparent}} magnitude of 10.4. located around 4 degrees west of the Grus Triplet.

Two ultraluminous X-ray sources and one supernova have been observed in NGC 7424. SN 2001ig was discovered in 2001 and classified as a Type IIb supernova, one that initially showed a weak hydrogen line in its spectrum, but this emission later became undetectable {{and was replaced by}} lines of oxygen, magnesium and calcium, as well as other features that resembled the spectrum of a Type Ib supernova.

5|$|IM Normae {{is one of}} {{only ten}} {{recurrent}} novae known in the Milky Way. It has erupted in 1920 and 2002, reaching magnitude 8.5 from a baseline of 18.3. It was poorly monitored after the first eruption, so it is possible that it erupted in between. Norma hosts two faint R Coronae Borealis variable stars of magnitude 10—RT Normae and RZ Normae—rare degenerate stars thought to have formed from the merger of two white dwarfs that fade by several magnitudes periodically as they eject large amounts of carbon dust. A faint object of magnitude 16, QV Normae is a high mass X-ray binary star system 15,000–20,000 light-years distant from Earth. It is composed of a neutron star orbiting a blue-white supergiant approximately 20times as massive as the Sun. The stellar wind from the more <b>massive</b> <b>star</b> is drawn to the magnetic poles of the neutron star, forming an accretion column and producing X-rays. Located 19,000 light-years away, QX Normae is an active low mass X ray binary composed of a neutron star and its companion star that is smaller and cooler than the Sun. The neutron star is 1.74 ± 0.14 times as massive as the Sun, yet its radius is a mere 9.3 ± 1.0km. 1E161348-5055 is a neutron star found in the centre of RCW103 supernova remnant. A periodic X-Ray source with a period of 6.67hours, it is approximately 2000 years old and 10,000 light-years away from Earth. It is unusual in that it is spinning much too slowly for its young age, behaving instead like a multi-million-year-old star. SGR J1550-5418 is a soft gamma repeater (SGR)—a magnetar that is emitting gamma ray flares, located some 30,000 light-years distant from Earth. The rotation period, of approximately 2.07 seconds, is the fastest yet observed for a magnetar. XTE J1550-564 is another X-ray binary, this time composed of a large black hole around 10 times as massive as the Sun and a cool orange donor star. The black hole is a microquasar, firing off jets of material most likely from its accretion disk.|$|E

25|$|The {{two most}} viable {{explanations}} put forth {{for the existence}} of blue stragglers both involve interactions between cluster members. One explanation is that they are current or former binary stars that {{are in the process of}} merging or have already done so. The merger of two stars would create a single more <b>massive</b> <b>star,</b> potentially with a mass larger than that of stars at the main-sequence turn-off point. While a star born with a mass larger than that of stars at the turn-off point would have already evolved off of the main sequence, a more <b>massive</b> <b>star</b> which formed via merger would not have evolved as quickly. There is evidence in favor of this view, notably that blue stragglers appear to be much more common in dense regions of clusters, especially in the cores of globular clusters. Since there are more stars per unit volume, collisions and close encounters are far more likely in clusters than among field stars and calculations of the expected number of collisions are consistent with the observed number of blue stragglers.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the dynamical effects of rapid gas expulsion {{from the core}} of a young stellar cluster. The aims of this study are to determine 1) whether a mass-segregated core survives the gas expulsion and 2) the probable location of any <b>massive</b> <b>stars</b> that have escaped from the core. Feedback from <b>massive</b> <b>stars</b> is expected to remove the gas from the core of the cluster first, as that is where most <b>massive</b> <b>stars</b> are located. We find that gas expulsion has little effect on the core for a core star formation efficiency, of greater than 50 %. For lower values of star formation efficiency down to 20 %, a reduced core survives containing the majority of the <b>massive</b> <b>stars</b> while some of them are dispersed into the rest of the cluster.
