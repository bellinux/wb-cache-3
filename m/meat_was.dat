5|$|Venison was {{the most}} popular game. The {{plentiful}} <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> often potted or jerked, and its tripe was popular as well. Venison was especially popular during the Thanksgiving season. Buffalo was an important protein source until roughly 1770, when the animals were over-hunted in the eastern United States. Bear were numerous in the northern colonies, especially in New York, and many considered the leg meat to be a delicacy. Bear <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> frequently jerked as a preservation method.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, Taiji's bid {{to expand}} their school lunch {{programs}} to include dolphin and whale meat brought about much controversy. An estimated 150kg (330lbs) of dolphin <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> served in Taiji school lunches in 2006. In 2009, dolphin <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> taken off school menus because of the contamination. The levels of mercury and methylmercury taken from samples of dolphin and whale meat sold at supermarkets {{most likely to be}} providing the schools' lunch programs was 10 times that advised by the Japanese Health Ministry. The mercury levels were so high that the Okuwa Co. supermarket chain in Japan permanently removed dolphin meat from its shelves.|$|E
5|$|During the 1870s ice {{began to}} be used by Timothy Eastman, of the Bell Brothers firm, to {{transport}} American meat to Britain; the first shipment successfully arrived in 1875 and by the following year 9,888 tons (8,909,000kg) of <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> shipped. The chilled <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> retailed through special warehouses and stores. There was concern in Britain that chilled American meat might flood the market and harm domestic farmers, but the exports continued. The rival Chicago-based meat firms of Armour and Swift entered the refrigerated meat transport market in the late 1870, establishing their own fleet of refrigerator cars, network of icing stations and other infrastructure, increasing the sales of chilled Chicago beef to the eastern seaboard from 15,680 tons (14,128,000kg) a year in 1880, to 173,067 tons (155,933,000kg) in 1884.|$|E
50|$|A {{common type}} of ground <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> ground beef, but many other <b>meats</b> <b>are</b> {{prepared}} ground in a similar fashion, including pork, lamb, and poultry. In South Asia, both lamb (mutton) and goat <b>meat</b> <b>are</b> also minced to produce keema, though the process of mincing is manual.|$|R
50|$|The base of Kazakh cuisine is төрт түлiк мал (tort tulik mal) - four {{kinds of}} cattle (i.e. four kinds of meat): horses, camels, cows, and sheep. Horse <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> the main festive meat, while sheep's <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> used as common <b>meat.</b> Camel <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> also {{a kind of}} festive meat, but not the main (as camels in Kazakhstan are not as common as horses). Cow's <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> also a kind of common meat.|$|R

5|$|In ancient Hawaii, {{fishermen}} occasionally hunted dolphins {{for their}} meat by driving {{them onto the}} beach and killing them. In their ancient legal system, dolphin <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> considered to be kapu (forbidden) for women together with several other kinds of food. Today, dolphin drive hunting no longer takes place in Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|From the Civil War {{until the}} 1920s and peaking in 1924, more <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> {{processed}} in Chicago {{than in any}} other place in the world. Construction began in June 1865 with an opening on Christmas Day in 1865. The Yards closed at midnight on Friday, July 30, 1971, after several decades of decline during the decentralization of the meatpacking industry. The Union Stock Yard Gate was designated a Chicago Landmark on February 24, 1972, and a National Historic Landmark on May 29, 1981.|$|E
5|$|In 1873 the Pekin duck was {{introduced}} to the United Kingdom. Although its <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> thought to have a poorer flavour than that of the Aylesbury duck, the Pekin was hardier and cheaper to raise. Many breeders switched to the Pekin duck or to Aylesbury-Pekin crosses. By the beginning of the 20th century competition from the Pekin duck, inbreeding, and disease in the pure-bred Aylesbury strain and the rising cost of duck food meant the Aylesbury duck industry was in decline.|$|E

50|$|The <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> {{used to make}} muscisca, a {{traditional}} food of transhumant pastoralists. Strips of goat's <b>meat</b> <b>are</b> salted, flavoured with garlic, and air- or sun-dried.|$|R
5|$|In Ancient China, rice was {{the staple}} crop {{in the south}} and wheat in the north, the latter made into dumplings, noodles, and pancakes. Vegetables used to {{accompany}} these included yams, soybeans, broad beans, turnips, spring onions, and garlic. The diet of the ancient Egyptians was based on bread, often contaminated with sand which wore away their teeth. <b>Meat</b> <b>was</b> a luxury but fish was more plentiful. These were accompanied by a range of vegetables including marrows, broad beans, lentils, onions, leeks, garlic, radishes, and lettuces.|$|E
5|$|<b>Meat</b> <b>was</b> more {{expensive}} and therefore more prestigious. Game, a form of meat acquired from hunting, was common only on the nobility's tables. The most prevalent butcher's meats were pork, chicken and other domestic fowl; beef, which required greater investment in land, was less common. Cod and herring were mainstays among the northern populations; dried, smoked or salted {{they made their way}} far inland, but a wide variety of other saltwater and freshwater fish was also eaten.|$|E
5|$|Substitutes, {{such as the}} wheat-based rice substitute, ptitim, were introduced, and {{versatile}} vegetables such as eggplant were used as alternatives to meat. Additional flavor and nutrition was provided from inexpensive canned tomato paste and puree, hummus, tahina, and mayonnaise in tubes. <b>Meat</b> <b>was</b> scarce, {{and it was not}} until the late 1950s that herds of beef cattle were introduced into the agricultural economy.|$|E
50|$|The main {{ingredients}} of the filling <b>are</b> <b>meat</b> which <b>is</b> usually pork. The <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> either grounded or sliced thinly. Some vendors use ground and sliced meat {{to give the}} bun a bite to it, but grounded <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> usually used since it produces more juice when cooked. The <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> usually marinated with a heaping of white or black pepper powder, soy sauce, sugar and cooking wine. Some vendors also add five-spice powder or curry powder to the meat marinate.|$|R
5000|$|These translations, however, seem {{divorced}} from the way people actually use language. A non-cognitivist would have to disagree with someone saying, [...] "'Eating <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> wrong' is a false statement" [...] (since [...] "Eating <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> wrong" [...] is not truth-apt at all), but {{may be tempted to}} agree with a person saying, [...] "Eating <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> not wrong." ...|$|R

In Nepal, Tibet, Darjeeling district, Assam, Sikkim and Bhutan, pork, chicken, goat meat and buffalo <b>meat</b> <b>are</b> commonly used. In the Himalayan region of Nepal and Ladakh, India, lamb and yak <b>meat</b> <b>are</b> more common. Minced <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> combined with {{any or all}} of the following: onions/shallots, garlic, ginger and cilantro/coriander. Some people also add finely puréed tomatoes and soy sauce.|$|R
5|$|The French {{government}} {{gave the}} former king an annual pension of eight hundred francs {{to pay off}} his debts. He was also given the task of administering over native affairs alongside the French commissioners assigned to the island. Laws that punished adultery and violation of the Sabbath, enacted during the kingdom's Protestant period, were revoked, and the royal monopoly on turtle <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> abolished.|$|E
5|$|The Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox Churches {{and their}} {{calendars}} had great influence on eating habits; consumption of <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> forbidden {{for a full}} third {{of the year for}} most Christians. All animal products, including eggs and dairy products (but not fish), were generally prohibited during Lent and fast. Additionally, it was customary for all citizens to fast prior to taking the Eucharist. These fasts were occasionally for a full day and required total abstinence.|$|E
5|$|When the <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> shriveling, flaking, {{and falling}} off, one {{anonymous}} donor gave the gallery $260 for replacement meat. (This number was of some debate, with $350 worth of meat listed in one vegetarian magazine.) Because {{of the negative}} publicity the work had received, gallery staff pretended to be caterers when finding a butcher in the Ottawa area to provide replacement meat.|$|E

In spite of comparatively low lysine content the red <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> adjudged more nutritious than white meat...|$|R
50|$|Shark <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> a seafood {{consisting}} of the flesh of sharks. Its consumption by humans has been mentioned since fourth century AD literature. Several sharks are fished for human consumption, such as porbeagles, shortfin mako shark, requiem shark, and thresher shark, among others. Shark <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> popular in Asia, where it is often consumed dried, smoked, or salted. Shark <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> consumed regularly in Japan, India, Sri Lanka, areas of Africa and Mexico. In western cultures, shark <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> sometimes considered as an inferior food, although its popularity has increased in Western countries.|$|R
5|$|A {{feature of}} central York is the Snickelways, narrow {{pedestrian}} routes, {{many of which}} led towards the former market-places in Pavement and St Sampson's Square. The Shambles is a narrow medieval street, lined with shops, boutiques and tea rooms. Most of these premises were once butchers' shops, and the hooks from which carcasses were hung and the shelves on which <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> laid out can still be seen outside some of them. The street also contains the Shrine of Margaret Clitherow, {{although it is not}} located in the house where she lived. Goodramgate has many medieval houses including the early 14thcentury Lady Row built to finance a Chantry, {{at the edge of the}} churchyard of Holy Trinity church.|$|E
5|$|Glamorgan sausage (Welsh: Selsig Morgannwg) is a {{traditional}} Welsh vegetarian sausage for which the main ingredients are cheese (usually Caerphilly), leeks and breadcrumbs. The earliest published mention of the dish is from the 1850s in the book Wild Wales by George Borrow, although earlier records in the Glamorgan Archives show a version which contains pork. The modern vegetarian version became popular during the Second World War when <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> harder to come by, and is now mass-produced by at least two companies. Variations include swapping the leeks for onions, as well as different herbs and spices, and various types of cheese.|$|E
5|$|Meats {{were more}} {{expensive}} than plant foods. Though rich in protein, the calorie-to-weight ratio of <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> {{less than that of}} plant food. Meat could be up to four times as expensive as bread. Fish was up to 16 times as costly, and was expensive even for coastal populations. This meant that fasts could mean an especially meager diet for those who could not afford alternatives to meat and animal products like milk and eggs. It was only after the Black Death had eradicated up to half of the European population that meat became more common even for poorer people. The drastic reduction in many populated areas resulted in a labor shortage, meaning that wages dramatically increased. It also left vast areas of farmland untended, making them available for pasture and putting more meat on the market.|$|E
500|$|Pilot whale <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> {{available}} for consumption in very few areas of Japan, mainly along the central Pacific coast, {{and also in}} other areas of the world, such as the Faroe Islands. The <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> high in protein (higher than beef) and low in fat. [...] Because a whale's fat is contained in the layer of blubber beneath the skin, and the muscle is high in myoglobin, the <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> a dark shade of red. In Japan, where pilot whale <b>meat</b> can <b>be</b> found in certain restaurants and izakayas, the <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> sometimes served raw, as sashimi, but just as often pilot whale steaks are marinated, cut into small chunks, and grilled. [...] When grilled, the <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> slightly flaky and quite flavorful, gamey, though similar to a quality cut of beef, with distinct yet subtle undertones recalling its marine origin.|$|R
50|$|Montreal smoked <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> {{made with}} variable-fat brisket, whereas pastrami is more {{commonly}} {{made with the}} fat-marbled navel/plate cut. Montreal smoked <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> typically served {{in the form of}} a light-rye bread sandwich accompanied with yellow mustard. While some Montreal smoked <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> brine-cured like corned beef, with spices applied later, many smoked meat establishments prefer dry-curing directly with salt and spices.|$|R

5|$|Regarding eating habits, Brahmins, Jains, Buddhists and Shaivas were {{strictly}} vegetarian {{while the}} partaking {{of different kinds}} of <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> popular among other communities. Marketplace vendors sold meat from domesticated animals such as goats, sheep, pigs and fowl as well as exotic meat including partridge, hare, wild fowl and boar. People found indoor amusement by attending wrestling matches (Kusti) or watching animals fight such as cock fights and ram fights or by gambling. Horse racing was a popular outdoor past time. In addition to these leisurely activities, festivals and fairs were frequent and entertainment by traveling troupes of acrobats, dancers, dramatists and musicians was often provided.|$|E
5|$|The {{conversion}} to <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> unfavorable for the Auxois, however. The Percheron was preferred {{for the quality}} of the meat and the Ardennais and closely related Auxois were considered to have some of the lowest quality meat. In addition, the promised market for horse meat did not materialize, and French slaughterhouses were overwhelmed by imports of cheap horses from the Americas and Eastern Europe. Because of this lack of profitability, the population of most French breeds, including the Auxois, continued to decline until 1994. The collapse in prices then forced the National Stud to redirect its draft horse-related activities.|$|E
5|$|The {{marriage}} {{tradition of}} the vodiondry, still practiced to this day throughout the Highlands, {{is said to have}} originated with Andriamanelo. According to oral history, after the sovereign had successfully contracted a marriage with Ramaitsoanala, sole daughter of Vazimba King Rabiby, Andriamanelo sent her a variety of gifts including vodiondrymeat from the hindquarters of a sheepwhich he believed to be the tastiest portion. The value placed on this cut of <b>meat</b> <b>was</b> reaffirmed by Ralambo who, upon discovering the edibility of zebu meat, declared the hindquarters of every slaughtered zebu throughout the kingdom to be his royal due. From the time of Andriamanelo forward, it became a marriage tradition for the groom to offer vodiondry to the bride's family. Over time the customary offerings of meat have been increasingly replaced by a symbolic piastre, sums of money and other gifts.|$|E
5|$|Capybaras <b>are</b> farmed for <b>meat</b> and skins in South America. The <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} unsuitable {{to eat in}} some areas, {{while in}} other areas it is considered {{an important source of}} protein. In parts of South America, especially in Venezuela, capybara <b>meat</b> <b>is</b> popular during Lent and Holy Week as the Catholic Church previously issued special dispensation to allow it to be eaten while other <b>meats</b> <b>are</b> generally forbidden.|$|R
