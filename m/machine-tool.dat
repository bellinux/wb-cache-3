2500|$|Instead of {{attending}} Harvard University, Taylor became an apprentice patternmaker and machinist, gaining shop-floor experience at Enterprise Hydraulic Works in Philadelphia (a pump-manufacturing company whose proprietors were {{friends of the}} Taylor family).

At Midvale, he was quickly promoted to time clerk, journeyman machinist, gang boss over the lathe hands, machine shop foreman, research director, and finally chief engineer of the works (while maintaining his position as machine shop foreman). Taylor's fast promotions reflected both his talent and his family's relationship with Edward Clark, part owner of Midvale Steel.

2500|$|The Chancellors Hotel & Conference Centre {{was built}} around The Firs, a house built in 1850 for Sir Joseph Whitworth by Edward Walters, who also {{designed}} Manchester's Free Trade Hall.

Whitworth, credited with raising the art of <b>machine-tool</b> building to a previously unknown level, supported the Mechanics Institute [...] – the birthplace of UMIST – and was a founder the Manchester School of Design.
