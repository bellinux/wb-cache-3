5000|$|There is also [...] "an {{upstream}} connected {{frangible disc}} safety relief device" [...] {{located on the}} valve assembly which {{is also known as}} the [...] "tri-dimensional burst disk". This burst disk protects the user against a situation where the pressure in the bottle would increase with exposure to heat during a fire. It prevents unwanted failures somewhere else in the bottle. It is set to release at 7200 psi, or 400 °F. It is [...] "tri-dimensional" [...] in that, if it is activated, it would disperse the air from the bottle in three directions so as not to throw the user off his or her balance. The high pressure <b>male</b> <b>coupling,</b> included in high pressure bottle connections, is set to met the Compressed Gas Association Standards #346 and #347.Also included in the assembly are the dual-sided pressure gauge (which reads the cylinder pressure directly from the cylinder), elastomeric bumper (a protective, rubber like stop), and hangar plate (for positive locking attachment of the assembly to the backframe).|$|E
50|$|The {{machines}} {{form part}} of the material handling equipment industry that, amongst others, also covers fork lift trucks, overhead cranes and pallet jacks.Although ‘electric tug’ {{is perhaps the most}} commonly used term, suppliers and customers regularly use a range of other names that include towing tractors, battery-powered tugs, electric hand trucks, electric tuggers and pedestrian operated tugs.The tugs move loads across a single level. They do not lift the load clear of the ground which is why the load must be on wheels. If the load itself does not have wheels, it would be placed on a wheeled platform often referred to as a trolley, bogie or skate. The tug connects to this wheeled platform just as a fork lift truck links to a pallet in order to move a load sat on it.In most cases a steel coupling (male) attached to the machine itself connects to a corresponding coupling (female) bolted to the load’s bogie. A second bogie or multiple bogies will each have identical female couplings attached to them so that a single <b>male</b> <b>coupling</b> attached to the machine can move them all without alterations.|$|E
40|$|A first {{annular ring}} of a tube {{coupling}} device has a keyed opening sized to fit around the nut region of a <b>male</b> <b>coupling,</b> {{and a second}} annular ring has a keyed opening sized to fit around the nut of a female coupling. Each ring has mating ratchet teeth and these rings are biased together, thereby engaging these teeth and preventing rotation of these rings. This in turn prevents {{the rotation of the}} male nut region with respect to the female nut. For tube-to-bulkhead locking, one facet of one ring is notched, and a pin is pressed into an opening in the bulkhead. This pin is sized to fit within one of the notches in the ring, thereby preventing rotation of this ring with respect to the bulkhead...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the division of}} paid labor among gay <b>male</b> and lesbian <b>couples</b> in the Netherlands. We hypothesize that same-sex couples have a more equal division of paid labor than different-sex couples, partly because of lower marriage and fertility rates, and partly because equity norms are more strongly embraced regardless of family stage. Furthermore, we expect that traditional gender roles result in more hours of paid work by gay <b>male</b> <b>couples</b> than lesbian couples. Descriptive and OLS regression analyses are carried out on 13 waves of the Dutch Labor Force Surveys (1994 - 2007), which include 998 gay <b>male</b> <b>couples</b> and 1, 033 lesbian couples. Results support all hypotheses: same-sex couples divide paid labor more equally than different-sex couples; lesbian couples specialize less after marriage or childbirth; and gay <b>male</b> <b>couples</b> work more hours than lesbian couples. We discuss how our findings can be translated across countries...|$|R
