5|$|The effects crew {{focused on}} using in-camera tricks {{to realize the}} probe; {{post-production}} effects were time-consuming, so lighting effects were done on stage while filming. <b>Model</b> <b>shop</b> supervisor Jeff Mann filled the probe's antenna with tube lamps and halogen bulbs that were turned on in sequence for different exposures; three different camera passes for each exposure were combined for the final effect. After watching the first shot, the team found the original, whalelike probe design lacking in menace. The modelmakers repainted the probe a shiny black, pockmarked its surface for greater texture and interest, and re-shot the scene. Although they wanted to avoid post-production effects work, the opticals team had to recolor the antenna ball in a blue hue, as the original orange looked too much like a spinning basketball.|$|E

40|$|Policy {{decisions}} regarding retailing facilities essentially involve multiple attributes of shopping centres. If mathematical <b>shopping</b> <b>models</b> are {{to contribute to}} these decision processes, their structure should reflect the multiattribute character of retailing planning. Examination of existing models shows that most operational <b>shopping</b> <b>models</b> include only two policy variables. A serious problem in the calibration of the existing multiattribute <b>shopping</b> <b>models</b> is that of multicollinearity arising {{from the fact that}} strong linear relationships among policy variables frequently occur in real world situations. This paper points at the technique of ridge regression analysis to overcome the problem of multicollinearity in the development of multiattribute <b>shopping</b> <b>models.</b> The use of ridge regression analysis is illustrated in an application of the multiplicative competitive interaction <b>model</b> to spatial <b>shopping</b> behaviour. ...|$|R

25|$|The first opening title sequence, used in {{the first}} five seasons, shows a slow-pan camera move over Ra's mask. The Stargate SG-1 {{producers}} had run out of time before the premiere of Season 1 and simply re-used the accelerated opening title sequence of the feature film. Ra's mask had been created in the feature film's <b>model</b> <b>shop</b> and had originally been filmed with a motion-control camera. Partly because Ra's mask looked cross-eyed, Brad Wright approached the art department in the following years to produce a new opening title sequence; however, the sequence remained the same until the show's move to the Sci-Fi Channel. During the first five seasons when the show was syndicated, a separate introduction was used; this intro is still used by Sci-Fi for Seasons 1-5. This version uses action shots of the original cast.|$|E
500|$|First Contact was {{the first}} Star Trek film to make {{significant}} use of computer-generated starship models, though physical miniatures were still used for the most important vessels. With the Enterprise-D destroyed during the events of Generations, the task of creating a new starship fell to veteran Star Trek production designer Herman Zimmerman. The script's only guide on {{the appearance of the}} vessel was the line [...] "the new Enterprise sleekly comes out of the nebula". Working with illustrator John Eaves, the designers conceived the new Sovereign Class Enterprise-E as [...] "leaner, sleeker, and mean enough to answer any Borg threat you can imagine". Braga and Moore intended it to be more muscular and militaryesque. Eaves looked at the structure of previous Enterprise iterations, and designed a more streamlined, capable war vessel than the Enterprise-D, reducing the neck area of the ship and lengthening the nacelles. Eaves produced 30 to 40 sketches before he found a final design he liked and began making minor changes. Working from blueprints created by Paramount's Rick Sternbach, the <b>model</b> <b>shop</b> at effects house Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) fabricated a [...] miniature over a five-month period. Hull patterns were carved out of wood, then cast and assembled over an aluminum armature. The model's panels were painted in an alternating matte and gloss scheme to add texture. The crew had multiple difficulties in prepping the miniature for filming; while the <b>model</b> <b>shop</b> originally wanted to save time by casting windows using a clear fiberglass, the material came out tacky. ILM instead cut the windows using a laser. Slides of the sets were added behind the window frames to make the interior seem more dimensional when the camera tracked past the ship.|$|E

500|$|Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) was {{responsible}} for The Voyage Homes model design and optical effects. The alien probe was the responsibility of ILM's <b>model</b> <b>shop,</b> which brought in outside help like illustrator Ralph McQuarrie for concept art. The modelmakers started with art director Nilo Rodis' basic design, a simple cylinder with whalelike qualities. The prototype was covered with barnacles and colored. The ball-shaped antenna that juts out {{from the bottom of}} the probe was created out of a piece of irrigation pipe; internal machinery turned the device. Three sizes of the [...] "whale probe" [...] were created; the primary [...] probe model was supplemented by a smaller model for wide shots and a large [...] model that used forced perspective to give the probe the illusion of massive dimensions.|$|E
500|$|The design effort {{produced}} {{a number of}} wooden models. A 24-inch long model, made of balsa wood, demonstrated placement of internal structure and access doors. An Air & Space article noted [...] "The <b>model</b> <b>shop</b> found it nearly impossible {{to make all the}} flat surfaces come to a single point in one corner. Engineers later encountered the same difficulty fabricating the prototype on the factory floor." [...] For early tests of the design, two ⅓-scale wooden mock-ups were constructed. One model, coated in metal foil, was used to verify ECHO 1's RCS calculations, while the other was earmarked for wind tunnel tests. Afterwards, a model was moved to the Grey Butte Range radar-testing facility in the Mojave Desert near Palmdale, which allowed more accurate tests of the aircraft's RCS. In the event, the aircraft's RCS level confirmed ECHO 1's predictions. This meant Ben Rich won a quarter from Johnson, who previously insisted that the D-21 had less RCS than Have Blue.|$|E
500|$|A then-record 3,000-plus {{special effects}} shots would {{ultimately}} {{be required for}} the film. The shoot utilized on-set, in-camera special effects more often than computer-generated effects {{in an effort to}} save money and get more authentic pyrotechnic results. Many of these shots were accomplished at Hughes Aircraft in Culver City, California, where the film's art department, motion control photography teams, pyrotechnics team, and <b>model</b> <b>shop</b> were headquartered. The production's model-making department built {{more than twice as many}} miniatures for the production than had ever been built for any film before by creating miniatures for buildings, city streets, aircraft, landmarks, and monuments. The crew also built miniatures for several of the spaceships featured in the film, including a 30-foot (9.1 m) destroyer model and a version of the mother ship spanning [...] City streets were recreated, then tilted upright beneath a high-speed camera mounted on a scaffolding filming downwards. An explosion would be ignited below the model, and flames would rise towards the camera, engulfing the tilted model and creating the rolling [...] "wall of destruction" [...] look seen in the film. A model of the White House was also created, covering [...] by , and was used in forced-perspective shots before being destroyed in a similar fashion for its destruction scene. The detonation took a week to plan and required 40 explosive charges.|$|E

500|$|Prisoners {{would be}} woken at 6:30 am, {{and sent to}} breakfast at 6:55. After {{returning}} to the cell, inmates then had to tidy their cell and place the waste basket outside. [...] At 7:30 work started in the shifts for those privileged enough to do so, punctuated by a whistle, and prisoners {{would have to go}} through a metal detector during work shifts. If assigned a job, prisoners had to accept that line of work; prisoners were not permitted to have money in their possessions but earnings went into a prisoner's Trust Fund. [...] Some of the prisoners were assigned duties with the guards and foremen in the Laundry, Tailor Shop, Cobblers Shop, <b>Model</b> <b>Shop</b> etc. and in gardening and labor. Smoking, a privilege, was permitted in the workplace providing there wasn't any hazardous condition, but inmates were not permitted to smoke between the recreation yard and work. Lunch was served at 11:20, followed by a 30-minute rest in the cell, before returning to work until 16:15. Dinner was served at 16:25 and the prisoners would then retire to their cells to be locked in for the night at 16:50, and lights went off at 21:30. After being locked in for the night, 6 guards usually patrolled the four cell blocks. Many prisoners have compared their duration at Alcatraz to hell and would have [...] preferred death to continued incarceration.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{analysis}} of model uncertainty in the context of shopping behaviour. This analysis is positioned in a discussion on the evolution of <b>models</b> of spatial <b>shopping</b> behaviour. For different generations of <b>shopping</b> <b>models,</b> the potential of uncertainty analysis is discussed. The actual analysis is based on an application of the Albatross model to the city of Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Characteristic of this <b>model</b> is that <b>shopping</b> trips are embedded in the prediction of daily more comprehensive activity-travel patterns, adding complexity and realism to traditional <b>models</b> of spatial <b>shopping</b> behaviour, such as the Huff and spatial interaction model. Results show that overall the uncertainty associated with the aggregate outcomes of the model is small. It is higher for the total number of visits to selected shopping areas...|$|R

2500|$|The {{previous}} Star Trek films {{had used}} conventional motion control techniques to record multiple passes of the starship models and miniatures. For Generations, the effects artists began using computer-generated imagery and models for certain shots. No physical shooting models were ever {{built for the}} refugee ships, although George recalled that he {{found it easier to}} create a quick physical miniature for CG modeler Rob Coleman to iterate from, rather than try to articulate his feedback without it. Other CGI elements included the solar collapses, and the Veridian III planet. Knoll also used a digital version of the Enterprise-D for the warp effect; the limitations of the motion-control programming and slitscan effect for the original meant that the effect [...] "barely holds up", Knoll said, whereas the CG recreation could keep consistent lighting throughout. While digital techniques were used for many sequences and ships, a few new models were physically built, including the observatory, built by <b>model</b> <b>shop</b> foreman John Goodson.|$|E
2500|$|The Technical Member (and {{the only}} engineer) on the Decimal Currency Board was Hugh Conway, {{at that time}} President of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and Managing Director of Bristol Siddeley Engines, Bristol. He had found in a {{mathematical}} textbook a formula for a non-circular shape of constant breadth and asked the design office at Patchway, near Bristol, which normally worked on the engines for aircraft such as Concorde, Vulcan and Harrier to draw out the shape. However, {{this turned out to}} be a wavy-edged form with re-entrant sides which would not roll and which could not be measured easily. A designer, Colin Lewis, suggested a much simpler shape which in its basic form is an equilateral triangle with a small circle centred on each apex and with a larger circular arc centred on each apex but tangential to each of the two opposite small circles. Wherever it was measured, the breadth of this shape was one small radius plus one large radius. (The small radius was not strictly necessary to the geometry, but made the shape more practical by removing inconvenient sharp points and reducing the rate of wear, and therefore change of size, in handling). The number of corners could be any odd number greater than one. A drawing was made to illustrate the proposal which was accepted by Hugh Conway. He chose seven sides as a compromise between too radical a shape, which might not be acceptable to the public, and having too many sides, which would make a shape visually difficult to differentiate from a circle. The shape was drawn out by Dave Brown and samples made from stainless steel by the <b>Model</b> <b>Shop,</b> together with a section of perspex channel with a bend to demonstrate that the [...] "coin" [...] would roll around corners and drop through gauging slots. The legend [...] "50" [...] was photo-etched (from a master drawn by Ray Gooding) on the faces of the samples since it had already been decided that the new coin would be the first coin of the new Decimal series.|$|E
