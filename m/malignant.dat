5|$|Diagnosis {{is based}} on a person's {{symptoms}} and history of medication use. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms such as neuroleptic <b>malignant</b> syndrome, <b>malignant</b> hyperthermia, anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, and meningitis should be ruled out. No laboratory tests can confirm the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Melanoma is a <b>malignant</b> {{proliferation}} of melanocytes {{and the most}} aggressive type of skin cancer.|$|E
5|$|Parsonnet et al. {{describe}} {{an association between}} H. pylori and lymphomas of the gastrointestinal tract. These <b>malignant</b> ulcers can also be treated by eradicating Helicobacter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha!" [...] {{said the}} rebel, {{considerably}} {{surprised at the}} young lady's manner of replying. [...] "Is it thus the <b>malignants</b> breed up their daughters, in insolence as well as deceit?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Away {{with him}} to prison!" [...] said Cromwell; [...] "and from thence to {{execution}} {{with the rest of}} them, as <b>malignants</b> taken in the fact. Let a courtmartial sit on them presently." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, but," [...] {{interrupted}} Robins, [...] "you are to {{know that}} Gilbert Pearson hath not fully executed thy commands, touching a part of those <b>malignants,</b> all of whom should have died at noon." ...|$|R
5|$|Cooksey had {{a form of}} {{skin cancer}} removed from his back in 2006, but was {{diagnosed}} with a recurrence of a <b>malignant</b> melanoma in February 2008. He died {{in the early hours of}} 3 July 2008, aged 28.|$|E
5|$|In malignant-type {{smallpox}} (also called flat smallpox) the lesions remained almost {{flush with}} the skin {{at the time when}} raised vesicles form in the ordinary type. It is unknown why some people developed this type. Historically, it accounted for 5–10 percent of cases, and the majority (72 percent) were children. <b>Malignant</b> smallpox was accompanied by a severe prodromal phase that lasted 3–4 days, prolonged high fever, and severe symptoms of toxemia. The rash on the tongue and palate was extensive. Skin lesions matured slowly and by the seventh or eighth day they were flat and appeared to be buried in the skin. Unlike ordinary-type smallpox, the vesicles contained little fluid, were soft and velvety to the touch, and may have contained hemorrhages. <b>Malignant</b> smallpox was nearly always fatal.|$|E
5|$|Mixed carcinomas {{are those}} that have both Type I and Type II cells, with one making up at least 10% of the tumor. These include the <b>malignant</b> mixed Müllerian tumor, which derives from endometrial {{epithelium}} and has a poor prognosis.|$|E
6000|$|... "I never swear, {{so please}} you," [...] replied Wildrake, recollecting himself, [...] "except {{there is some}} mention of <b>malignants</b> and cavaliers in my hearing; and then the old habit returns, and I swear like one of Goring's troopers." ...|$|R
6000|$|Heavy {{steps were}} at last heard, and Pearson {{and some of}} the {{soldiers}} returned. This seemed to be what Cromwell waited for. He started up, and asked hastily, [...] "Any news, Pearson? any prisoners--any <b>malignants</b> slain in thy defence?" ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Malignants</b> {{is a name}} {{used for}} the advisors of Charles I of England, chief among whom wereStrafford and Laud; were so called by the Parliamentarians, who blamed them for the evils of the country; the name was {{afterwards}} applied to the whole Royalist party.|$|R
5|$|Pancreatic mucinous cystic {{neoplasms}} are a broad {{group of}} pancreas tumors that have varying <b>malignant</b> potential. They are being detected at a greatly increased rate as CT scans become {{more powerful and}} common, and discussion continues as how best to assess and treat them, given that many are benign.|$|E
5|$|Sadasivan was {{diagnosed}} with colorectal cancer and underwent surgical removal of a <b>malignant</b> tumour in 2008. He relinquished his Information, Communications and the Arts portfolio with effect from 1 April 2008, remaining as Senior Minister of State for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.|$|E
5|$|Smallpox virus {{preferentially}} attacks skin cells, {{causing the}} characteristic pimples (called macules) {{associated with the}} disease. A rash develops on the skin 24 to 48 hours after lesions on the mucous membranes appear. Typically the macules first appear on the forehead, then rapidly spread to the whole face, proximal portions of extremities, the trunk, and lastly to distal portions of extremities. The process takes no more than 24 to 36 hours, after which no new lesions appear. At this point variola major infection can take several very different courses, resulting in four types of smallpox disease based on the Rao classification: ordinary, modified, <b>malignant</b> (or flat), and hemorrhagic. Historically, smallpox has an overall fatality rate of about 30 percent; however, the <b>malignant</b> and hemorrhagic forms are usually fatal.|$|E
60|$|On {{the other}} hand, the real Church--it {{might be of}} but 200 men--was confronting the Kirk of the <b>malignants,</b> and alone was genuine. The State did not make and could not unmake 'the Trew Church,' but was bound to establish, foster, and obey it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where was he when I {{last saw}} him? Charging {{down the main}} street of Worcester, where the <b>malignants</b> and Charles Stewart made their last stand. Smiting them hip and thigh with the sword of Gedaliah, nay, my tongue tripped, 'twas Gideon I would say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, nay," [...] {{answered}} Wildrake, [...] "I {{thought you}} asked me in your own person.--Lack-a-day! a great mercy--a glorifying mercy--a crowning mercy--a vouchsafing--an uplifting--I profess the <b>malignants</b> are scattered from Dan to Beersheba--smitten, hip and thigh, even until the going down of the sun!" ...|$|R
25|$|A {{neoplasm}} can be benign, potentially <b>malignant,</b> or <b>malignant</b> (cancer).|$|E
25|$|A digital {{watermark}} is called semi-fragile if it resists benign transformations, but fails detection after <b>malignant</b> transformations. Semi-fragile watermarks commonly {{are used to}} detect <b>malignant</b> transformations.|$|E
25|$|Melanomas* {{account for}} four to six percent of skin tumors in dogs and are usually benign. They are {{the second most common}} tumor of the toe and are <b>malignant</b> in this location. <b>Malignant</b> {{melanoma}} is also a common oral tumor in dogs. <b>Malignant</b> tumors most commonly spread to the lymph nodes and lungs.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will forgive}} me," [...] the Parliament officer said to Harry. [...] "In these times one cannot be too suspicious, {{and even the}} best friends of the Commons need not grudge a little delay in their journeyings, in order that the doings of the <b>malignants</b> may be arrested." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I come," [...] {{replied the}} ambassador, {{in a high}} and shrill voice, and {{without any of the}} usual salutations or deferences,--"I come from the godly army of the Solemn League and Covenant, to speak with two carnal <b>malignants,</b> William Maxwell, called Lord Evandale, and Miles Bellenden of Charnwood." ...|$|R
5000|$|As to the latter, {{within a}} few days of Naseby, the Scots rejoiced that the [...] "back of the <b>malignants</b> was broken". They demanded reinforcements, as a {{precaution}} against [...] "the insolence of others", i.e., Cromwell and the Independents, [...] "to whom alone the Lord has given the victory of that day".|$|R
25|$|ICD-10 classifies {{neoplasms}} {{into four}} main groups: benign neoplasms, in situ neoplasms, <b>malignant</b> neoplasms, and neoplasms of uncertain or unknown behavior. <b>Malignant</b> neoplasms are also simply known as cancers {{and are the}} focus of oncology.|$|E
25|$|The {{expression}} of hTERT {{can also be}} used to distinguish benign tumors from <b>malignant</b> tumors. <b>Malignant</b> tumors have higher hTERT expression than benign tumors. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) quantifying hTERT expression in various tumor samples verified this varying expression.|$|E
25|$|About 1 out of 1000 lesions are {{or become}} <b>malignant,</b> {{typically}} as a leiomyosarcoma on histology. A sign that a lesion may be <b>malignant</b> is growth after menopause. There {{is no consensus}} among pathologists regarding the transformation of leiomyoma into a sarcoma.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hadst thou {{said that}} at once," [...] the man grumbled, [...] "I might have {{admitted}} you before. There are many rumors of plots {{on the part of}} the <b>malignants</b> against the life of the general. I will take your message to Madam Cromwell, and she can deal with it as she will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{that is an}} {{advantage}} which you have over the planters in Virginia, to which place I hear our Scottish brethren have sent large numbers of the <b>malignants.</b> There are great woods stretching no man knoweth how far inland, and inhabited by fierce tribes of Indians, among whom those who escape find refuge." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should not}} be unwilling to sell," [...] the planter answered, [...] "for a fair price, but the profits are good, {{and are likely to}} be better, for I hear that large numbers of <b>malignants,</b> taken by the sword of the Lord Cromwell at Dundalk and Waterford in Ireland, will be sent here, and with more labor to till the fields, our profits will increase." ...|$|R
25|$|An {{osteosarcoma}} (OS) or {{osteogenic sarcoma}} (OGS) is a cancerous tumor in a bone. Specifically, {{it is an}} aggressive <b>malignant</b> neoplasm that arises from primitive transformed cells of mesenchymal origin (and thus a sarcoma) and that exhibits osteoblastic differentiation and produces <b>malignant</b> osteoid.|$|E
25|$|Hyperthermia is {{an example}} of a high {{temperature}} that is not a fever. It occurs from a number of causes including heatstroke, neuroleptic <b>malignant</b> syndrome, <b>malignant</b> hyperthermia, stimulants such as substituted amphetamines and cocaine, idiosyncratic drug reactions, and serotonin syndrome.|$|E
25|$|<b>Malignant</b> {{histiocytosis}} (histiocytic sarcoma) is {{an aggressive}} cancer found primarily in certain breeds including the Bernese Mountain Dog, rottweiler, golden retriever and flat coated retriever. It {{is characterized by}} infiltration of the joints, lungs, spleen, lymph nodes, and other organs by <b>malignant</b> histiocytes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, there's a {{great deal}} to be said for the Florentine Arrabiati, {{as well as for the}} English <b>Malignants,</b> though the Puritans in neither case would have known how to say it. Savonarola perished because he was excessive. I am {{studying}} him in this aspect; it is fresh ground. It is very interesting to inquire just at what point a man's virtues become mischievous and intolerable." ...|$|R
50|$|Metropolitan Savas {{was born}} Savas Zembillas in Gary, Indiana, on June 11, 1957, {{the second of}} six {{children}} of Skevofylax ("Steve") and Stamatia (Georgiades) Zembillas.

While at Colby, he performed as the lead singer for campus punk band Mick and the <b>Malignants.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{do not see}} it in that light," [...] {{returned}} Mr. Welsh. [...] "I {{agree with}} your views, and think our Indulged brethren in the wrong; but I counsel forbearance, and cannot agree {{with the idea that}} it is our duty to refuse all connection with them, and treat them as if they belonged to the ranks of the <b>malignants.</b> See what such opinions have cost us already in the overwhelming disaster at Bothwell Brig." ...|$|R
