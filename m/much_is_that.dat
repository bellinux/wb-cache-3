25|$|The JWST has {{a history}} of major cost overruns and delays which have {{resulted}} from outside factors such as delays in deciding on a launch vehicle and adding extra funding for contingencies. The first budget estimates were that the observatory would cost $1.6 billion and launch in 2011, but NASA has now scheduled the telescope for a 2019 launch on a budget that has grown to $8.8 billion. In 2011, the United States House of Representatives voted to terminate funding, after about $3 billion had been spent and 75% of its hardware was in production. Funding was restored and capped at $8 billion. , the telescope remained on schedule for a spring 2019 launch and within the 2011 revised budget. One of the reasons why the cost grew so <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it is difficult to forecast the cost of development, and in general budget predictability improved when initial development milestones were achieved.|$|E
500|$|... "Swingin Party" [...] {{was written}} by Paul Westerberg and {{produced}} by Tommy Ramone, and was recorded by The Replacements. It is an indie rock and rock and roll ballad with influences from jazz, country and new wave. It features staccato chords instrumented by electric guitar. According to Bill Janovitz from AllMusic, the song climbs scales in a way reminiscent of [...] "Somethin' Stupid" [...] by Frank Sinatra and Nancy Sinatra (1967). The lyrics are introspective, and portray the protagonist's [...] "feigned nonchalance". Writing for Spin, editor J.D. opined that the song's theme is [...] "literary reflections" [...] as Westerberg sings, [...] "Quttin' school and goin' to work and never goin' fishin'". According to Tim Holmes of Rolling Stone, the song's theme is that [...] "life is a lilting series of ultimately empty, but nonetheless compulsory, soirees", while Robert Hilburn from the Los Angeles Times wrote that the song is [...] "about loneliness and youthful insecurity". In an interview for the Los Angeles Times, Westerberg said: [...] "One {{of the reasons we}} used to drink so <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it was scary going up on stage. That's one of the things 'Swingin' Party' is all about on the album ... how it is a little frightening to put yourself on display all the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Music was {{originally}} created by Brian Johnston (Scott's younger brother), who sampled bits of copyrighted music. This had been common practice, {{but at that}} point there was a growing awareness of music copyright. Psygnosis asked Tim Wright to replace the offending tracks, who often used arrangements and reworkings of classical and traditional music to avoid copyright problems. Music tracks in the game include: [...] "Galop Infernal" [...] from Orpheus in the Underworld (the music by Offenbach often used for the can-can), [...] "Rondo alla Turca" [...] from Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 11, [...] "Dance of the Reed Flutes" [...] from Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite, [...] "Dance of the Little Swans" [...] from Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake, [...] "Ten Lemmings" [...] (a track that uses melodies from traditional song [...] "Ten Green Bottles"), Chopin's Piano Sonata No. 2 (the part used as funeral march), Wagner's [...] "Bridal Chorus" [...] (popularly known as [...] "Here Comes the Bride"), [...] "London Bridge is Falling Down", the English folk tune [...] "Forest Green" [...] (adapted into the hymn [...] "All Beautiful the March of Days"), the carol [...] "O Little Town of Bethlehem" [...] mixed with the melody from the film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, [...] "She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain" [...] and [...] "(How <b>Much</b> <b>Is)</b> <b>That</b> Doggie in the Window?".|$|E

2500|$|The public {{information}} campaign over the preceding two years helped, {{as did the}} trick of getting a rough conversion of new pence into old shillings and pence by simply doubling {{the number of new}} pence and placing a solidus, or slash, between the digits: 17p multiplied by 2=34, – approximately equal to 3/4 ("three and four", or three shillings and four pence), with a similar process for the reverse conversion. The willingness of a young population to embrace the change also helped. In general, elderly people had more difficulty adapting and the phrase [...] "How <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> in old money?" [...] or even [...] "How <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> in real money?" [...] became associated with those who struggled with the change.

It spent 13 weeks atop the Billboard magazine's Best-Sellers List in 1950. Page had three additional No.1 hit singles between 1950 and 1953, [...] "All My Love (Bolero)", [...] "I Went to Your Wedding", and [...] "(How <b>Much</b> <b>Is</b> <b>That)</b> Doggie in the Window".|$|E

The song {{included}} a dog barking in the recording, which helped make it popular {{and one of her}} best-known and signature songs. The song was written by the novelty tune specialist Bob Merrill. It was originally recorded by Page for a children's album, [...] "Arfie Goes To School" [...] that year. She had a series of Top 20 hits that year. A final single that year reached the Top 5 titled [...] "Changing Partners," [...] which peaked at No.3 and stayed on the charts for five months. The song was also recorded in a country melody, like many of Page's hits at the time.|$|E

[...] From there, {{he worked as a}} radio producer and co-host at WMCA (and briefly thereafter at WMGM), [...] working with personalities such as Laraine Day on the late night interview program [...] "Day At Night" [...] and with Eva Gabor. At the same time, he was doing promotion for several baseball players, including Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays, and his radio beginnings may be attributable to his connection with the New York Giants, whose manager, Leo Durocher, was the husband of Laraine Day. His work on those shows earned him his own late-night show that often featured his wife as co-host, as was popular at the time. [...] For a while in the 1950s he was president of the National Conference of Disk Jockeys.|$|E

60|$|You {{dislike the}} Emancipation Proclamation, and perhaps {{would have it}} retracted. You say it is unconstitutional. I think differently. I think the Constitution invests its {{commander-in-chief}} with the law of war in time of war. The most that can be said, if so <b>much,</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> slaves are property. Is there, has there ever been, any question that by the law of war, property, both of enemies and friends, may be taken when needed? And is it not needed whenever it helps us and hurts the enemy? Armies, the world over, destroy enemies' property when they cannot use it, and even destroy their own {{to keep it from}} the enemy. Civilized belligerents do all in their power to help themselves or hurt the enemy, except a few things regarded as barbarous or cruel.

60|$|This {{intelligence}} did {{not disturb}} me, of course, {{for it was}} tavern-tidings and neighbours' news. Neighbours! How <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> sacred word prostituted! You shall find people opening their ears with avidity to the gossip of a neighbourhood, when nineteen times in twenty it is less entitled to credit than the intelligence which is obtained from a distance, provided the latter come from persons of the same class in life as the individuals in question, and are known to them. What means had this woman of knowing the secrets of Herman Mordaunt's family, that were one-half as good as those possessed by friends in Albany, for instance? This neighbourhood testimony, as it is called, does a vast deal of mischief in the province, and most especially in those parts of it where our own people are brought in contact with their fellow-subjects, from the more eastern colonies. In my eyes, Jason Newcome's opinions of Herman Mordaunt, and his acts, would be nearly worthless, shrewd as I admit the man to be; for the two have not a distinctive opinion, custom, and I had almost said principle, in common. Just appreciation of motives and acts can only proceed from those who feel and think alike; and this is morally impossible where there exist broad distinctions in social classes. It is just {{for this reason that}} we attach so little importance to the ordinary reports, and even to the sworn evidence, of servants.|$|E
