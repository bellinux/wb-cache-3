50|$|From 1886 to 1939, the Royal Artillery <b>Mounted</b> <b>Band</b> {{served as}} the mounted {{counterpart}} of the Royal Artillery Band for horse artillery units of the Royal Artillery {{under the banner of}} the Royal Horse Artillery and was the United Kingdoms, and one of Europes most famous <b>mounted</b> <b>bands,</b> and the favourite of Queen Victorias. At the funeral of Queen Victoria on 2 February 1901, the Royal Artillery <b>Mounted</b> <b>Band</b> preceded the royal hearse, and the ceremonial troops of both the Royal Horseguards and the Lifeguards, followed by the Royal Artillery (Woolwich) Band. It was the first military band in Great Britain to ever appear on cinematic film. Like all bands of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, the Band maintained a full orchestra capability for which it was in great demand, particularly throughout Europe during the Cold War years. The Band was disbanded in 1984 as a result of Ministry of Defence cost-cutting measures.|$|R
50|$|In 1949 the Royal Horse Guards were disbanded. 1 {{squadron}} and the <b>mounted</b> <b>band</b> of 14 musicians {{formed the}} Life Guards.

As fewer and fewer conscripted musicians were available professional musicians were once again enrolled and in 2011-12 the band was once again a full time professional military band.|$|R

5000|$|Later in the {{foundation}} {{year of the}} <b>Mounted</b> <b>Band</b> at Woolwich, news was received that the Duke of Cambridge had made the decision, {{that because of the}} large proportion of Horse and Field Artillery equipment, and troops situated in Aldershot, it was only right that the Garrison should have a <b>mounted</b> <b>band</b> permanently stationed there. During the following year, 25 mounted musicians and horses were posted to Aldershot, leaving 35 mounted musicians with the Royal Artillery Band in Woolwich. On 26 August 1887, the Woolwich 'mounted band' was suppressed. All of its members transferred to the Aldershot band. The remaining 12 musicians were absorbed into the Royal Artillery Band, which was ordered to provide a 'Mounted Portion' of twenty players. Eight musicians were immediately required to undergo rider training in order to prepare for mounted duty. The 'Mounted Portion' comprised: 1 'Serjeant in charge', 2 Bombardiers, and 17 'Bandsmen'. In 1894, the then Duke of Connaught arranged for a searchlight display to take place in Aldershot, for Queen Victoria. The Royal Artillery <b>Mounted</b> <b>Band,</b> as the main band opened the impressive display, that would become the first of the Aldershot Command searchlight tattoos, held annually to audiences often exceeding 500,000. Among its other prestigious engagements, the Royal Artillery <b>Mounted</b> <b>Band</b> [...] "the largest <b>mounted</b> <b>band</b> ever seen" [...] Times had the privilege of heading the Lord Mayor of London's processions, and the funeral procession of Queen Victoria in 1901 where it preceded the hearse. Under its famous bandmaster, Mr James Lawson, the band contributed regularly to the Woolwich Town Hall concerts, but purely as a military band, [...] "in which sphere was widely documented at the time, it eclipsed the Royal Artillery Band. It ought to be mentioned, that the famous Italian conductor of the Royal Artillery Band, Cavaliere Ladislao Zavertal, deliberately took no notice of Mr Lawson's achievements, preferring to concentrate his efforts into transforming the Royal Artillery Orchestra (Britain's oldest-established permanent orchestra, founded in 1763) into the ensemble that would become renowned throughout Europe.|$|R
50|$|The {{oldest of}} all British {{military}} bands, is the Royal Artillery Band (see also Royal Artillery <b>Mounted</b> <b>Band).</b> The Band can trace its origins back to 1557 at the Battle of St. Quentin, {{although it was}} not made 'official' until 1762. A series of army reviews starting in 1994 reduced the number of British Army military bands from 69 to 22 bands.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the height}} of Queen Victoria's reign, the number of band {{personnel}} in the Royal Artillery rose to over one hundred and fifty, including its 'symphony orchestra' of over eighty musicians. The massed bands of the Royal Regiment of Artillery must therefore have been a truly formidable sight, particularly {{in the company of}} the Royal Artillery <b>Mounted</b> <b>Band</b> [...] "The largest <b>mounted</b> <b>band</b> ever seen" [...] (reprinted in 1984 in The Times), and the various other minor artillery bands that also existed. By the end of the so-named 'British Empire', its size had reduced, but it continued to grow again, until, in 1977, the band comprised one hundred and twenty musicians, and on special occasions could be seen on parade with the regiment's massed bands - the Royal Artillery <b>Mounted</b> <b>Band</b> (forty-seven strong), and the (forty strong) Royal Artillery Alanbrooke Band). In 1980, the Army Board had {{come to the conclusion that}} the Royal Artillery Band, the Royal Artillery <b>Mounted</b> <b>Band,</b> and the Royal Artillery Alanbrooke Band would be required to adopt a wartime role. At that time, there were sixty-eight bands in the Army, and apart from the Royal Artillery bands, all of them fulfilled the traditional wartime role as stretcher bearers. It was decided that in the case of the Royal Artillery bands, the musicians would be trained as drivers, and all three bands quickly ensured that their members were trained and qualified as HGV 2 drivers, with additional experience driving 10-tonne Monarch trucks, during Operation Lionheart, in 1982.|$|R
