5|$|The wooden Pontnewydd aqueduct, {{which was}} prone to the river flowing over its top, was {{replaced}} by an iron one built on a slightly higher level to provide <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> the river to flow under it. Pinkerton's two locks were rebuilt, and {{the banks of the}} Kymer canal were raised by , to allow the water level to be raised. This had also required the Kidwelly basin walls to be raised. At the southern end, access to Burry Port harbour required a deep cutting to be constructed, and this was completed by March 1835.|$|E
5|$|Another {{solution}} to the high-speed problem is the delta wing. The delta wing had {{many of the same}} advantages of the swept wing in terms of transonic and supersonic performance, but offered much more internal room and overall surface area. This provided <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> fuel, an important consideration given the inefficient early jet engines of the era, and the large wing area provided ample lift at high altitudes. The delta wing also enabled slower landings than swept wings in certain conditions. The disadvantages of the design were increased drag at lower speeds and altitudes, and especially higher drag while maneuvering. For the interceptor role these were minor concerns, as the aircraft would be spending most of its time flying in straight lines at high altitudes and speeds, mitigating these disadvantages.|$|E
5|$|From the 12th {{century the}} manor of Muchland was {{administered}} from Aldingham Castle. Muchland {{became known as}} Aldingham manor and in 1291 it came into the ownership of the Harrington family. In the 14th century, the Scots attacked the Furness peninsula during the Scottish Wars of Independence; {{around the same time}} coastal erosion threatened Aldingham Motte. These factors may have led to the Harrington family abandoning Aldingham and establishing the administrative centre of the manor at the newly built Gleaston Castle, though the construction work could have been the result of their growing social status, and they may have needed <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> a greater number of servants.|$|E

50|$|The School is also {{currently}} undergoing extensive reconstruction {{with plans}} to rebuild the school entirely in Four Stages. The Science Building was completed 2007 to provide <b>more</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>for</b> the core subject of sciences. This block, along with the Performing Arts Centre (PAC for short), was part of Stage 1 of the Building Plan.|$|R
50|$|The Guesthouse is {{the first}} {{facility}} {{to be built in}} the compound at its establishment in 1956. However, with the growing need for in-patient facility, the current hospital building was built in 1960. Expansions were made mid-1970s to accommodate <b>more</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>for</b> hospital beds and laboratory facilities. Currently, the main hospital includes an FDA-licensed pharmacy, out-patient clinics, hospital <b>rooms</b> <b>for</b> 25 patients, a radiology room and a laboratory.|$|R
5|$|On August 19, 1864, {{with his}} {{remaining}} guerrillas facing serious supply problems and suffering from hunger, Định was betrayed {{by a former}} follower and ambushed by French forces. Wounded and facing imminent capture, Định committed suicide. His 20-year-old son Truong Quyen (1840–1870), attempted with modest success to carry on his father's struggle. A new base {{was set up in}} Tây Ninh. It allowed <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> tactical manoeuvring but still depended on supplies being carried north from Tan Hoa. Quyen was eventually killed and in 1874, long after the southern insurgency had been crushed, Tự Đức granted a monthly allowance in grain and cash to Định's widow Le Thi Thuong, who had returned to her native village in Quảng Ngãi, which at the time was still in independent Vietnamese territory. The ration of 20 francs and 60 litres of rice was substantial, because the monthly salary of a ninth-rank mandarin was only 18 francs and 48 litres of rice.|$|E
5|$|The unibody-construction MacBook Pro largely {{follows the}} styling of the {{original}} aluminum iMac and the MacBook Air and is slightly thinner than its predecessor, albeit wider and deeper due to the widescreen display. The screen is high-gloss, covered by an edge-to-edge reflective glass finish, while an anti-glare matte option {{is available in the}} 15- and 17-inch models in which the glass panel is removed. The entire trackpad is usable and acts as a clickable button. The trackpad is also larger than the first generation model's, giving <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> scrolling and multi-touch gestures. When the line was updated in April 2010, inertial scrolling was added, making the scrolling experience much like that of the iPhone and iPad. The keys, still backlit, are now that of Apple's now-standard sunken keyboard with separated black keys.|$|E
5|$|The {{walls of}} the church were {{completely}} restored in 2003. At {{the same time the}} altar was moved closer to the congregation, making <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> the choir. The baptismal font was relocated from the chapel to the front, opposite the ambo. The tabernacle, which had been where the baptismal font is now, and the crucifixion scene were moved to the chapel, creating a chapel for adoration. The restoration works were directed by Franz Josef Hamm from Limburg. The new cross above the altar was created by a group of young people in preparation for confirmation. During the restoration the organ had to be taken apart. The parish decided not to restore it, but to have a new organ built.|$|E

50|$|Some of the Qiongsha class {{cargo ship}} are {{converted}} to troopships, though {{the exact number}} remain unknown. These troopships still maintained the original cargo carrying capacity of 350 tons, but lack the emergency medical treatment capability because the clinical care facility on board the cargo version is deleted to make <b>more</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>for</b> additional troops, {{with the number of}} passengers carried is increased to 400.|$|R
5000|$|The {{library was}} {{originally}} {{located in the}} City Hall. In 1972, an old match-making factory closed down. By 1989, it had been remodelled into the current buildings. Together, they form the [...] "Cité du livre," [...] which includes a screening-room for independent films and <b>more</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>for</b> authors' lectures. It also houses the Fondation Saint-John Perse and the Association des amis de Jules Isaac.|$|R
5|$|Working for Clair Brothers, Jackson toured with Elvis Presley, mixing {{monitors}} while independent engineer Bill Porter mixed {{front of}} house (FOH) for the audience. Clair Brothers supplied all the audio gear; Jackson designed a powerful stage monitor system for Presley's show. To make <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> audience seating, he also used a sound reinforcement {{system that was}} not mounted on scaffolding but hung with steel chain above the audience from overhead beams, using chain hoists rigged upside down to raise the loudspeakers from the floor—a now-common method used by licensed riggers. Jackson {{has said that he}} made a number of concert recordings during this period, all unreleased.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, a re-organization took place. Until then, {{there were}} games of skittles, large dance floors, and trees for {{climbing}} in the beer booths. Organizers wanted <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> guests and musicians which resulted in the booths becoming beer halls which are still used today.|$|E
25|$|The twin-skeg {{principle}} {{also means}} that the engines can be lower and further back, allowing <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> cargo. Maersk requires ultra-long stroke two-stroke engines running at 80rpm (versus 90rpm in the E class); but this requires more propeller area for the same effect, and such a combination is only possible with two propellers due to the shallow water depth of the desired route.|$|E

25|$|In 15 BCE, {{during the}} third and final {{building}} phase, the entire site of Masada – except for the Northern Palace – was enclosed by a casemate wall, which included a double wall with a space between that was used as living chambers for the soldiers and as extra storage space. The Western Palace was also extended for a third time to include <b>more</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>for</b> the servants and their duties.|$|R
50|$|In 1910, Sultan Abdul Hamid II {{ordered to}} {{reconstruct}} the mosque, renew the wall and build <b>more</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>for</b> students and poor people. These renovations costed 2,300 liras. There were several other reconstructions over the years. The most important ones were in 1918 and 1935, where the old rooms were replaced with bigger new rooms, and 1948, where they renewed the flooring and verses of Al-Fath was written {{on the walls of}} the hallways.|$|R
25|$|The {{increase}} in traffic {{and the new}} Allianz Arena also required a larger capacity of this already overcrowded pivotal transfer station. New pedestrian tunnels were built, which provide <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> passengers transferring from and to the S-Bahn. They lie parallel to the existing platforms and are connected to them by 11 portals. At the south end, they meet the transverse tunnel, where the escalators to the S-Bahn platforms are located.|$|E
25|$|As Jairzinho accelerated, {{the ever}} {{dangerous}} striker Tostão began a sprint up the middle, drawing his defender with him, diverting the Italian defence and making <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> Jairzinho. Younger players should note the movement {{off the ball}} by Brazil. Increasingly squeezed inside, Jairzinho's run nevertheless drew the defence {{to him and he}} eased the ball to Pelé in the centre. Always dangerous, Pelé paused and shaped to make a dribble.|$|E
25|$|The North Avenue Bridge {{can refer}} {{to one of three}} bridges that has carried North Avenue (Illinois Route 64) over the North Branch of the Chicago River {{on the north side of}} Chicago, Illinois. A center-pier swing bridge built in 1877 was {{replaced}} in 1907 by a bascule bridge, allowing river traffic <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> maneuvering in and out of the North Canal, just north of Goose Island.|$|E

50|$|The hotel {{originally}} {{served as}} for official purposes. On the ground were offices. West wing was housing the tax {{office of the}} county and in the eastern one were located a meeting hall of the District Committee, as well as District Mayor offices.His private apartment {{was standing in the}} northern part of the edifice, and in the attic were also four <b>more</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>for</b> ancillary service. The building possessed a low pressure water heating system, and electrical and gas installations.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With {{the general}} {{progress}} of information technology, the computer & network technology are generally {{applied in the}} tax system of which it will make <b>more</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>for</b> the tax administration and services in implementing the electronization, networking, transparency and efficiency developments. Meanwhile, the computer & network security issues become more prominent and significant in the e-tax system. In the paper, the author puts forward the corresponding solutions and measures by analyzing the network risks of the e-tax applications from the technical and management points...|$|R
25|$|Carleton S. Coon {{also has}} a {{hypothesis}} for why noses on Mongoloids are very distinct. Typically, the nose is not very prominent {{on the face of}} a Mongoloid. Their frontal sinus is also reduced in order to allow <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> padding to protect from their cold environment. Regardless of the environment that the mongoloid is in, his nose helps reduce the stress of the environment on their body by moistening the air inspired to cool the body off instead of doing a straight up heat exchange.|$|E
25|$|In the July Budget, Osborne also {{planned to}} cut tax credits, which top up pay for low-income workers, {{prompting}} claims that this represented {{a breach of}} promises made by colleagues before the general election in May. Following public opposition and a House of Lords vote against the changes, Osborne scrapped these changes in the 2015 Autumn Statement, saying that higher-than-expected tax receipts gave him <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> manoeuvre. The IFS noted that Osborne's proposals implied that tax credits would still be cut {{as part of the}} switch to Universal Credit in 2018.|$|E
25|$|Originally an {{armament}} {{of three}} machine guns was planned, with two Lewis guns firing forwards and downwards through the cockpit floor {{as in the}} TF.1, and a forward firing Vickers machine gun. This was changed to a conventional battery of two synchronised Vickers guns {{in front of the}} cockpit, as on the Snipe, before the first prototype was complete. The guns were staggered, with the starboard gun mounted a few inches forward of the port one to give <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> ammunition. Four light bombs could also be carried.|$|E
50|$|Many swinger clubs {{will have}} a dozen or <b>more</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>for</b> sexual activity. The {{lifestyle}} clubs are also often decorated in themes with furniture to match. Rooms may be decorated like a tropical oasis to Arabian Nights to caves to rooms with mirrors everywhere. Most clubs will also have voyeur rooms that have windows where patrons can engage in sex and {{know that they are}} being watched by other patrons of the club. Some swinger clubs go as far as to have rotating beds in the voyeur rooms to continually change the view for those watching.|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s Sky Classic Aircraft of Des Moines, Iowa was {{developing}} an improved {{version of the}} Miniplane designated as the Smith Sport Miniplane. This model featured <b>more</b> cockpit <b>room</b> <b>for</b> larger pilots, a new airfoil and re-drawn plans to aid construction.|$|R
50|$|Hell Raisers: A {{pneumatic}} ram can tilt up specific {{sections of}} the arena floor. The 15 degree tilt may become a launching ramp, or may abruptly block passage. The Hell Raisers were removed for Season 5 to allow <b>more</b> uncluttered <b>room</b> <b>for</b> the robots.|$|R
25|$|In {{cities where}} {{bicycles}} are not {{integrated into the}} public transportation system, commuters often use bicycles as elements of a mixed-mode commute, where the bike is used to travel to and from train stations {{or other forms of}} rapid transit. Some students who commute several miles drive a car from home to a campus parking lot, then ride a bicycle to class. Folding bicycles are useful in these scenarios, as they are less cumbersome when carried aboard. Los Angeles removed a small amount of seating on some trains to make <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> bicycles and wheel chairs.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, LKAB {{started to}} push for lower {{transport}} costs. At the time, NSB had a 50% profit margin on the operations, or about NOK60 to 70 million per year. A committee was established by both countries' transport ministries to find areas of improvement. During the 1970s and 1980s, {{the number of employees}} working on the ore logistics had been halved, and NSB stated that they did not believe there was much <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> higher efficiency. El 12 were retired in 1989 and 1990, and one twin unit has been preserved by Ofoten Museum.|$|E
25|$|By the 1980s the {{original}} design, which had mobile lounges meet each plane, {{was no longer}} well-suited to Dulles' role as a hub airport. Instead, midfield concourses were added to allow passengers to walk between connecting flights without visiting the main terminal. Mobile lounges were still used for international flights and to transport passengers between the midfield concourses and the main terminal. An underground tunnel (consisting of a passenger walkway and moving sidewalks) which links the main terminal and Concourse B was opened in 2004. The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) began a renovation program for the airport including a new security mezzanine with <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> lines.|$|E
5000|$|A {{boarding}} {{house is a}} house (frequently a family home) in which lodgers rent one or <b>more</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>for</b> one or <b>more</b> nights, and sometimes for extended periods of weeks, months, and years. The common parts of the house are maintained, and some services, such as laundry and cleaning, may be supplied. They normally provide [...] "room and board," [...] that is, at least some meals as well as accommodation. A [...] "lodging house," [...] also known in the United States as a [...] "rooming house," [...] {{may or may not}} offer meals. Lodgers legally only obtain a licence to use their rooms, and not exclusive possession, so the landlord retains the right of access.|$|R
50|$|Further {{remodeling}} {{was completed}} in 2002. The pews were removed to create <b>more</b> seating <b>room</b> <b>for</b> a growing congregation, under-floor heating, carpet, Jerusalem stone tiles, wood flooring, and {{a state of the}} art AV system with projector screens and television monitors were installed to create a modern venue for a living church.|$|R
50|$|In {{the later}} Middle Ages or early modern period, many European market towns erected {{communal}} market halls, comprising a covered open space {{to function as}} a sheltered marketplace at street level, and one or <b>more</b> <b>rooms</b> used <b>for</b> public or civic purposes on the upper floor or floors. Such buildings were frequently the precursors of dedicated town halls.|$|R
