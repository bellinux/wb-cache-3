500|$|The {{film was}} shot using the video mode of two Canon EOS 5D Mark II and one Canon EOS 1D Mark IV digital single-lens reflex cameras, which helped the filmmakers {{look more like}} typical park visitors. To {{compensate}} for their inability to control the lighting, the film was shot in <b>monochrome</b> <b>mode.</b> [...] "e were shooting with really fast lenses wide open, so our depth of field was razor thin. Black and white helped us enormously with focus and composition, since we were doing almost everything in camera and didn't use a focus puller," [...] Moore recalled. It was an irreversible choice. [...] "ecause the 5D doesn't shoot RAW, we customized settings in its monochromatic mode and couldn't go back to color, {{even if we had}} wanted to." [...] Moore was comfortable with the result because of the surrealistic, dreamlike quality it created, forcing viewers to see the familiar sights of the Disney parks in a new way.|$|E

5000|$|The GTIA also fixed {{an error}} in CTIA that caused {{graphics}} to be misaligned by [...] "half a color clock". The side effect of the fix was that programs that relied on color artifacts in high-resolution <b>monochrome</b> <b>modes</b> would show a different pair of colors.|$|R
50|$|Galaksija Plus was an {{improved}} version of Galaksija, with 256x208 <b>monochrome</b> graphics <b>mode,</b> 3-voice sound based on AY-3-8910 and 48 KiB RAM.|$|R

50|$|Early {{versions}} of the MDA board have hardware capable of outputting red, green and blue TTL signals on the normally unconnected video connector pins, theoretically allowing an 8-color display with a suitable monitor. The registers also allow the <b>monochrome</b> <b>mode</b> to be set on and off. No software exists to actually control the feature.|$|E
50|$|The base Rainbow system {{generates a}} TTL composite-video signal in <b>monochrome</b> <b>mode.</b> With the {{inclusion}} of the graphics option, the Rainbow could also output sync-on-green RGB video signals at TTL levels. The Rainbow was most often coupled with the 12-inch VR201 monochrome monitor or the 13-inch VR241 color monitor, both produced by Digital Equipment Corporation.|$|E
50|$|Turok 2: Seeds of Evil is an action-platform {{video game}} {{developed}} by Bit Managers {{and published by}} Acclaim Entertainment. It was released for the Game Boy Color handheld game console in 1998 alongside its Nintendo 64 counterpart. The game is backward compatible with the original Game Boy in <b>monochrome</b> <b>mode.</b> Although the game {{is set in the}} same fictional universe as its counterpart, it features a different storyline.|$|E
5000|$|The RCA CDP1861 was a {{very simple}} chip, built in CMOS {{technology}} (which was unusual for the mid 70s) to complement the RCA 1802 microprocessor, it was mainly used in the COSMAC VIP. It could only support a very low resolution <b>monochrome</b> graphic <b>mode.</b>|$|R
50|$|The MCGA {{supports}} all CGA display <b>modes</b> plus 640×480 <b>monochrome</b> at {{a refresh}} rate of 60 Hz, and 320×200 with 256 colors (out of {{a palette of}} 262,144) at 70 Hz. The display adapter uses a DE-15 connector. The MDA <b>monochrome</b> text <b>mode</b> is not supported.|$|R
50|$|Super 9: This mode {{is based}} out of Graphics 0, {{but with the}} GTIA flag set so that it {{displays}} GRAPHICS 9, the 16 <b>monochrome</b> shade <b>mode.</b> The character set and background register are modified every VBI, resulting in a 2x8 character grid which can display 256 duo-tone shades.|$|R
5000|$|... {{on board}} bit mapped colour {{graphics}} (no [...] "text" [...] mode), with timing {{provided by a}} Motorola 6845 CRT controller. The video could produce 320x200 in 16 colours, or 640x200 in a palette of 4 colours out of 16, with a later modification providing a 960x512 <b>monochrome</b> <b>mode.</b> The frame buffer resided in system memory and video refresh provided DRAM refresh cycles. The video output was able to drive CGA, EGA, MGA and multisync monitors.|$|E
50|$|Turok 2: Seeds of Evil was {{developed}} by the Spanish video game company Bit Managers and published by Acclaim Entertainment. The standard platform levels of the game were first created on graph paper and then replicated on a level editor, before becoming a playable level on the Game Boy hardware. The music of the game was composed by Alberto Jose González, who also produced the music of the previous handheld Turok game, Turok: Battle of the Bionosaurs. The game is backward compatible with the original Game Boy in <b>monochrome</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
50|$|VGA {{adapters}} usually support both monochrome {{and color}} modes, though the <b>monochrome</b> <b>mode</b> is almost never used, {{and support for}} the full set of MDA text mode attributes (intense, underline) is often missing. Black and white text on nearly all modern VGA adapters is drawn by using gray colored text on a black background in color mode. VGA monochrome monitors intended primarily for text were sold, but most of them will work at least adequately with a VGA adapter in color mode. Occasionally, a faulty connection between a modern monitor and video card will cause the VGA part of the card to detect the monitor as monochrome; this will cause the BIOS and initial boot sequence to appear in greyscale. Usually, once the video card's drivers are loaded (for example, by continuing to boot into the operating system), they will override this detection and the monitor will return to color.|$|E
5000|$|Despite all this, the {{underline}} is {{not normally}} visible in color modes, as {{the location of}} the underline defaults to a scanline below the character glyph, rendering it invisible. [...] If the underline location is set to a visible scanline (as it is by default when switching to an MDA-compatible <b>monochrome</b> text <b>mode)</b> then the underline will appear.|$|R
50|$|The Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA, also MDA card, Monochrome Display and Printer Adapter, MDPA) is IBM's {{standard}} {{video display}} card and computer display {{standard for the}} PC introduced in 1981. The MDA {{does not have any}} pixel-addressable graphics modes. It has only a single <b>monochrome</b> text <b>mode</b> (PC video mode 7), which can display 80 columns by 25 lines of high resolution text characters or symbols useful for drawing forms.|$|R
50|$|The Atari {{computer}} {{version is}} <b>monochrome</b> hi-res <b>mode</b> {{and could be}} played in a shade of green, blue, or black depending on the chip in the computer, and the monitor settings. Later versions also included an orange mode depending on the machines chipset. Dithering was used to create shades on screen. The color version for the Atari 8-bit more or less resembled the on-screen colors and dithering of the Apple II, but on a light greenish tinged screen.|$|R
5000|$|The Amiga is able {{to emulate}} other {{computer}} platforms ranging from many 8-bit systems such as the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Nintendo Game Boy, Nintendo Entertainment System, Apple II and the TRS-80. The Commodore PC-Transformer software emulated an IBM 5150 at 1 MHz in <b>Monochrome</b> <b>mode.</b> Later PC-Bridgecards were a full hardware PC on a card with 8086/80286/80386 Intel chips running MS-DOS and Windows in an Amiga window. A-Max emulated an Apple Macintosh using a serial port dongle that had a Macintosh ROM on it. The Amiga had the same 68000 CPU as the Macintosh and, using a Macintosh emulator, could run Mac 68K operating systems and programs. However, the Amiga could not directly read Macintosh 3.5" [...] floppies due to their proprietary format. Further, it required a compatible Macintosh {{for a copy of}} its ROM. The Atari ST was also emulated. MAME (the arcade machine emulator) is also available for Amiga systems with PPC accelerator card upgrades.|$|E
5000|$|The Dazzler {{supported}} four graphics modes in total, {{selected by}} setting or clearing bits {{in the control}} register (0F) that controlled two orthogonal selections. The first selected {{the size of the}} frame buffer, either 512 bytes or 2 kB. The other selected normal or [...] "X4" [...] mode, the former using 4-bit nybbles packed 2 to a byte in the frame buffer to produce an 8-color image, or the latter which was a higher resolution <b>monochrome</b> <b>mode</b> using 1-bits per pixel, 8 to a byte. Selecting the mode indirectly selected the resolution. In normal mode with a 512 byte buffer there would be 512 bytes × 2 pixels per byte = 1,024 pixels, arranged as a 32 by 32 pixel image. A 2 kB buffer produced a 64 by 64 pixel image, while the highest resolution used a 2 kB buffer in X4 mode to produce a 128 by 128 pixel image. In normal mode the color was selected from a fixed 8-color palette with an additional bit selecting intensity, while in X4 mode the foreground color was selected by setting three bits in the control register to turn on red, green or blue (or combinations) while a separate bit controlled the intensity.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{principal}} photography, {{the cast}} and crew bought season passes to both the Disneyland and Walt Disney World resorts. They spent ten days in Florida, then returned to California for two weeks at Disneyland, making the parks depicted in the film a combination of both resorts. Actors and crew entered the parks in small groups to avoid attracting attention. [...] "At one point, I even made the camera department shave off their facial hair and dress in tourist attire, which almost provoked a mutiny," [...] says Moore. Despite the actors wearing the same clothes for days on end, Moore told the Los Angeles Times, park personnel never appeared to notice them, save for one day near the end of filming when Disneyland security thought they were paparazzi harassing a celebrity family.The film was shot using the video mode of two Canon EOS 5D Mark II and one Canon EOS 1D Mark IV digital single-lens reflex cameras, which helped the filmmakers look more like typical park visitors. To compensate for their inability to control the lighting, the film was shot in <b>monochrome</b> <b>mode.</b> [...] "We were shooting with really fast lenses wide open, so our depth of field was razor thin.

25|$|This {{was to be}} a {{portable}} computer with an integral flat-screen CRT display. Initially to be ZX Spectrum-compatible with a faster Z80 CPU, a built-in ZX Microdrive and a new 512×192-pixel <b>monochrome</b> video <b>mode.</b> Due to the limited size of flat CRT that could be manufactured, a series of folding lenses and mirrors were necessary to magnify the screen image to a usable size. The project was cancelled after the Amstrad take-over, but the Pandora concept eventually transformed into the Cambridge Computer Z88.|$|R
5000|$|Introduced in 1982, the non-IBM Hercules Graphics Card offers both an MDA {{compatible}} {{high resolution}} text <b>mode</b> and a <b>monochrome</b> graphics <b>mode.</b> It can address individual pixels, and display {{a black and}} white picture of 720&times;348 pixels. This resolution is better than even the highest monochrome resolution CGA cards can offer. Thus, even without a color capability of any kind, the Hercules adapter's offer of monochrome graphics without sacrificing MDA-equivalent text quality made it a more desirable choice for many.|$|R
5000|$|In 1982, the non-IBM Hercules Graphics Card (HGC) was introduced, {{the first}} {{third-party}} video card for the PC. In {{addition to an}} MDA-compatible text mode, it offered a <b>monochrome</b> graphics <b>mode.</b> With a resolution of 720&times;348 pixels, it had a higher resolution than that produced by CGA. The Hercules' combination of sharp monochrome text and graphics capabilities made it ideal for running software such as Lotus 1-2-3 that supported business graphics. Some games also had Hercules support, and most others {{could be made to}} work with HGC via SimCGA, a TSR which would reformat the CGA graphics memory to HGC format in the background.|$|R
40|$|Images of {{scanning}} {{electron microscope}} are usually in the <b>monochrome</b> <b>mode.</b> A simple and user-friendly approach is proposed to improve the mechanical contrast of the {{scanning electron microscope}} grey images. Also, most colourization techniques involve image segmentation or region tracking, which tend to degrade the image with fuzzy or complex region boundaries. A technique is proposed, which is a hybrid between the Canny edge detection technique and the optimization technique. Compared with existing methods, the new Canny optimization technique gives satisfactory results for scanning electron microscope images...|$|E
40|$|The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) {{consists}} of two imaging systems that provide synoptic and high resolution imaging of the lunar surface. The Wide Angle Camera (WAC) is a seven color push frame imager with a 90 ° field of view in <b>monochrome</b> <b>mode</b> and 60 ° field of view in color mode. From the nominal 50 km polar orbit, the WAC acquires images with a nadir pixel scale of 75 m for each visible band and 384 m for the two ultraviolet bands. The Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) {{consists of}} two identical cameras capable of acquiring images with a pixel scale of 0. 5 to 1. 0 m from a 50 km orbit. Each camera was geometrically calibrated prior to launch at Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego, California. Using thousands of images acquired since launch in June of 2009, improvements to the relative and absolute pointing of the twin NACs were made allowing images on the surface to be projected with an accuracy of 20 meters. Further registration of WAC and NAC images allowed the derivation of a new distortion model and pointing updates for the WAC, thus enabling sub-pixel accuracy in projected WAC images...|$|E
50|$|Atari's 16-bit {{computer}} range utilized a 13-pin DIN connector for its video output; {{this single}} connector could carry the colour RGB signals, a composite video signal, the high-resolution monochrome video signal, {{vertical and horizontal}} sync, ground, mono audio, and later, external video clock input, each on its own dedicated pin. If Pin 4 was connected to ground, the computer would detect this and boot into the high-resolution <b>monochrome</b> video <b>mode</b> that was not user-selectable and only worked with specially designed monitors (the vertical refresh rate being 71 Hz as opposed to 50/60 Hz for colour modes). Atari also used a 14-pin DIN connector for their external floppy disk drives, primarily for space-saving reasons; the port occupies much less of the crowded rear of the computer than on contemporaries such as the Amiga and Macintosh, which used physically larger D-shell connectors with a 20+ pin count.|$|R
5000|$|The Luxor ABC 800 {{series are}} office-versions of the ABC 80 home computer. They {{featured}} an enhanced BASIC interpreter, a slightly faster clocked CPU and more memory: 32 kilobytes RAM and 32 KB ROM was now standard, the Z80 is clocked at 3.58 MHz (using an NTSC color subcarrier crystal). It featured 40×24 text mode with eight colors (ABC 800 C) or 80×24 text <b>mode</b> <b>monochrome</b> (ABC 800 M). They {{could also be}} extended with [...] "high" [...] resolution graphics (240×240 pixels at 2 bpp) using 16 KB RAM as video memory.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{microcomputer}} {{technology to}} solve {{many of the}} iterative and tedious computations encountered in the engineering field is becoming prominent. Coastal Engineering {{is one of the}} many fields in engineering where the presence of the microcomputer is being felt. The need to compete efficiently and economically in the engineering market requires the accessibility to and use of computer software to speed up some of the menial tasks. This thesis presents the development and demonstrated use of three (3) such software packages. The data encryption software, CADGRID, water wave refraction and diffraction software, MUNWAVE, and the water basin response software, LONGWAVE, were developed using the Microsoft, QuickBasic program development software on a 80386 CPU based microcomputer system with 80387 coprocessor. The plotting routines were written using the Hewlett Packard Graphics Language (HPGL). The programs CADGRID and LONGWAVE will work in either EGA, VGA, CGA or Hercules <b>monochrome</b> graphics <b>mode</b> with VGA recommended. The program MUNWAVE will only operate in EGA graphics mode...|$|R
50|$|The 5151 was {{designed}} {{to work with the}} PC's Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) text-only graphics card, but the third-party Hercules Graphics Card became a popular companion to the 5151 screen because of the Hercules' comparatively high-resolution bitmapped 720×348 pixel monochrome graphics capability, much used for business presentation graphics generated from spreadsheets like Lotus 1-2-3. This was much higher resolution than the alternative IBM Color Graphics Adapter 320×200 pixel, or 640×200 pixel graphic standard. It could also run most programs written for the CGA card's standard graphics <b>modes.</b> <b>Monochrome</b> monitors continued to be used, even after the introduction of higher resolution color IBM Enhanced Graphics Adapter and Video Graphics Array standards in the late 1980s, for dual-monitor applications.|$|R
5000|$|Monochrome monitor support - CodeView {{supported}} debugging {{on either}} a single color (CGA, EGA or VGA) monitor with page/memory swapping between the user application and the CodeView screen, {{or through a}} feature which utilized a separate monochrome monitor. The monochrome monitor existed in memory address space 0xb0000, while the color monitor existed at 0xb8000 for text and 0xa0000 for graphics. Use of the monochrome monitor with its separate memory address space allowed debugging graphics applications without affecting the display, {{as well as all}} text <b>modes.</b> <b>Monochrome</b> monitor support was limited to 25 lines, whereas color monitors could utilize 25, 43 or 50 line mode, allowing {{for more information on the}} screen at the same time.|$|R
40|$|A fully functional, {{prototype}} {{night vision}} camera system is described which produces true-color imagery, using a visible/near-infrared (VNIR) color EMCCD camera, fused with the output from a thermal long-wave infrared (LWIR) microbolometer camera. The fusion is {{performed in a}} manner that displays the complimentary information from both sources without destroying the true-color information. The system can run in true-color mode in day-light down to about -moon conditions, below this light level the system can function in a <b>monochrome</b> VNIR/LWIR fusion <b>mode.</b> An embedded processor is used to perform the fusion in real-time at 30 frames/second and produces both digital and analog color video outputs. The system can accommodate a variety of modifications to meet specific user needs, and various additional fusion algorithms can be incorporated making the system a test-bed for real time fusion technology under a variety of conditions...|$|R
