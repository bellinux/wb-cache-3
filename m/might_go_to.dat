5|$|On October 21, 2010, Miller and Bello jointly {{announced}} on ESPNU {{that they would}} attend Baylor University. In August 2010, Scout.com had named Miller their number two prospect in the country behind Anthony Davis. At {{the time of the}} announcement, Miller was the top-ranked high school class of 2011 power forward in the nation according to Rivals.com and the number two prospect in the nation behind Gilchrist according to PrepStars Rob Harrington, who had thought he <b>might</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Louisville. In November, Miller and Bello signed their letters of intent. At the time he signed his letter of intent, he was ranked the 2nd best player in the nation by Scout.com and PrepStar, while Rivals.com listed him fifth. In 2011, Big12Sports.com has repeatedly described Miller as a potential Top 10 draft pick. As an incoming freshman for the 2011–12 Bears, he was one of five Big 12 Conference players named to the Naismith College Player of the Year preseason top 50 watchlist. Baylor entered the season without 2011–12 Big 12 Conference basketball season preseason player of the year Perry Jones who was on a five-game suspension for having accepted improper benefits before arriving at Baylor. Nonetheless, Dime Magazine included Miller, Jones and Bello in its list of Top 25 Breakout Players & Teams To Watch In The NBA, College & High School This Season.|$|E
25|$|Research {{suggests}} that sleep patterns vary significantly across cultures. The most striking differences are between societies that have plentiful sources of artificial light and {{ones that do}} not. The primary difference appears to be that pre-light cultures have more broken-up sleep patterns. For example, people without artificial light <b>might</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sleep far sooner after the sun sets, but then wake up several times throughout the night, punctuating their sleep with periods of wakefulness, perhaps lasting several hours.|$|E
25|$|While in New York, Menken met {{the poet}} Walt Whitman {{and some others}} of his bohemian circle. She was {{influenced}} by his work and began to write in a more confessional style while adhering to common sentimental conventions of the time. In 1860-61, she published 25 poems in the Sunday Mercury, an entertainment newspaper in New York. These were later collected with six more in her only book, Infelicia, published {{a few months after}} her death. By publishing in a newspaper, she reached a larger audience than through women's magazines, including both men and women readers who <b>might</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> see her perform as an actress.|$|E

25|$|The Visayans {{believed}} {{that when the}} time comes for a person to die, the diwata Ynaguinid visits him to bring about death. Magwayan, the soul ferry god, carries the souls of the Yligueynes to the abode of the dead called Solad. But when a bad person dies, the diwata Pandakesita brings him to the place of punishment in the abode of the dead, where his soul will wait {{to move on to the}} Ologan or heaven. While the dead is undergoing punishment, his family could help him by asking the priests or priestesses to offer ceremonies and prayers so that he <b>might</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the place of rest in heaven.|$|E
25|$|During the Arameans' {{siege of}} Samaria, four leprous {{men at the}} gate asked each other why they should die there of starvation, when they <b>might</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Arameans, who would either save them or leave them no worse than they were. When at twilight, {{they went to the}} Arameans' camp, there was no one there, for God had made the Arameans hear chariots, horses, and a great army, and fearing the Hittites and the Egyptians, they fled, leaving their tents, their horses, their donkeys, and their camp. The lepers went into a tent, ate and drank, and carried away silver, gold, and {{clothing}} from the tents and hid it.|$|E
25|$|After Henry II {{became the}} Lord of Ireland, {{he and his}} successors began to imitate the English system {{as it was in}} their time. Irish Earls were first created in the thirteenth century, and Irish Parliaments began in the fifteenth century, {{complete}} with seven Barons of Parliament. The Irish peers were in a peculiar political position; because they were subjects of the King of England, but peers in a different kingdom, they could sit in the English House of Commons, and many did. In the eighteenth century, Irish peerages became rewards for English politicians, limited only by the concern that they <b>might</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Dublin and interfere with the Irish Government.|$|E

25|$|In April, Lord Rosmead {{resigned}} his posts of High Commissioner for Southern Africa and Governor of Cape Colony. The situation {{resulting from}} the Jameson raid {{was one of the}} greatest delicacy and difficulty, and Joseph Chamberlain, now colonial secretary, selected Milner as Lord Rosmead's successor. The choice was cordially approved by the leaders of the Liberal party and warmly recognized at a farewell dinner on 28 March 1897 presided over by the future prime minister Herbert Henry Asquith. The appointment was avowedly made in order that an acceptable British statesman, in whom public confidence was reposed, <b>might</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> South Africa to consider all the circumstances and to formulate a policy which should combine the upholding of British interests with the attempt to deal justly with the Transvaal and Orange Free State governments.|$|E

2500|$|A {{delicate}} {{political issue}} arose regarding the brokerage firm of Moore and Schley, which was {{deeply involved in}} a speculative pool in the stock of the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company. Moore and Schley had pledged over $6 million of the Tennessee Coal and Iron (TCI) stock for loans among the Wall Street banks. [...] The banks had called the loans, and the firm could not pay. If Moore and Schley should fail, a hundred more failures would follow and then all Wall Street <b>might</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> pieces. Morgan decided they had to save Moore and Schley. TCI {{was one of the}} chief competitors of U.S. Steel and it owned valuable iron and coal deposits. [...] Morgan controlled U.S. Steel and he decided it had to buy the TCI stock from Moore and Schley. Elbert Gary, head of U.S. Steel, agreed, but was concerned there would be antitrust implications that could cause grave trouble for U.S. Steel, which was already dominant in the steel industry. Morgan sent Gary to see President Theodore Roosevelt, who promised legal immunity for the deal. U.S. Steel thereupon paid $30 million for the TCI stock and Moore and Schley was saved. The announcement had an immediate effect; by November 7, 1907, the panic was over. The crisis underscored the need for a powerful oversight mechanism.|$|E

2500|$|The 1890s and 1900s {{marked the}} height of the [...] "yellow peril" [...] {{propaganda}} by the German government and the German Emperor Wilhelm II often wrote letters to his cousin Nicholas II of Russia, praising him as the [...] "savior of the white race" [...] and urging Russia forward in Asia. From November 1894 onward, Wilhelm had been writing letters praising Nicholas as Europe's defender from the [...] "yellow peril", assuring the Tsar that God Himself had [...] "chosen" [...] Russia to defend Europe from the alleged Asian threat. On 1 November 1902, Wilhelm wrote to Nicholas that [...] "certain symptoms in the East seem to show that Japan is becoming a rather restless customer" [...] and [...] "it is evident to every unbiased mind that Korea must and will be Russian". Wilhelm ended his letter with the warning that Japan and China would soon unite against Europe, writing: [...] "Twenty to thirty million Chinese, supported by a half dozen Japanese divisions, led by competent, intrepid Japanese officers, full of hatred for Christianity—that is a vision of the future that cannot be contemplated without concern, and it is not impossible. On the contrary, it is the realisation of the yellow peril, which I described {{a few years ago and}} I was ridiculed by the majority of people for my graphic depiction of it... Your devoted friend and cousin, Willy, Admiral of the Atlantic". Wilhelm aggressively encouraged Russia's ambitions in Asia as France, Russia's ally since 1894, was less than supportive of Russian expansionism in Asia, and it was believed in Berlin that German support of Russia might break up the Franco–Russian alliance and lead to a new German–Russian alliance. The French, who had been Russia's closest allies since 1894, made it clear that they disapproved of Nicholas's forward policy in Asia with the French Premier Maurice Rouvier publicly declaring that the Franco–Russian alliance applied only to Europe, not Asia, and that France would remain neutral if Japan attacked Russia. The American president Theodore Roosevelt, who was attempting to mediate the Russian–Japanese dispute, complained that Wilhelm's [...] "yellow peril" [...] propaganda, which strongly implied that Germany <b>might</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war against Japan in support of Russia, encouraged Russian intransigence. On 24 July 1905, in a letter to the British diplomat Cecil Spring Rice, Roosevelt wrote that Wilhelm bore partial responsibility for the war as [...] "he has done all he could to bring it about", charging that Wilhelm's constant warnings about the [...] "yellow peril" [...] had made the Russians uninterested in compromise as Nicholas believed that Germany would intervene if Japan attacked. The implicit promise of German support suggested by Wilhelm's [...] "yellow peril" [...] speeches and letters to Nicholas led many decision-makers in St. Petersburg to believe that Russia's military weaknesses in the Far East like the uncompleted Trans-Siberian railroad line did not matter as it was assumed the Reich would come to Russia's assistance of if war should come. In fact, neither Wilhelm nor his Chancellor Prince Bernhard von Bülow had much interest in East Asia, and Wilhelm's letters to Nicholas praising him as Europe's savior against the [...] "yellow peril" [...] were really meant to change the balance of power in Europe as Wilhelm believed that if Russia was embroiled with Japan, this would break up the Franco–Russian alliance and lead to Nicholas signing an alliance with Germany. This was especially the case as Germany had embarked upon the Tirpitz plan and a policy of Weltpolitik meant to challenge Britain's position as the world's leading power, and since Britain was allied to Japan, then if Russia and Japan could be manipulated into going to war with each other, that this in turn would lead to Russia turning towards Germany. Furthermore, Wilhelm believed if a Russian–German alliance emerged, France would be compelled to join it and having Russia pursue an expansionist policy in Asia would keep Russia out of the Balkans, thus removing the main source of tension between Russia and Germany's ally Austria–Hungary. During the war, Nicholas who took at face value Wilhelm's [...] "yellow peril" [...] speeches, placed much hope in German intervention on his side, and more than once, Nicholas chose to continue the war out of the belief that the Kaiser would come to his aid.|$|E
