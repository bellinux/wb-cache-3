5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Roddenberry was likely afflicted {{by the first}} manifestations of {{cerebral}} vascular disease and encephalopathy {{as a result of}} his longstanding recreational use of legal and illicit drugs, including alcohol, cannabis, diazepam, secobarbital, <b>methaqualone,</b> methylphenidate, Dexamyl, and cocaine (which he had used regularly since the production of Star Trek: The Motion Picture). Throughout much of his career, he had routinely used stimulants to work through the night on scripts, especially amphetamines. The effects of these substances were compounded by deleterious interactions with diabetes, high blood pressure, and antidepressant prescriptions.|$|E
25|$|Drugs {{most often}} {{associated}} with this term include: alcohol, cannabis, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, <b>methaqualone,</b> opioids and some substituted amphetamines. The exact cause of substance abuse is not clear, with the two predominant theories being: either a genetic disposition which is learned from others, or a habit which if addiction develops, manifests itself as a chronic debilitating disease.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the alleged}} acts fall outside the {{statutes}} of limitations for criminal legal proceedings, but criminal {{charges have been filed}} against Cosby in one case and numerous civil lawsuits have been brought against him. As of November 2015, eight related civil lawsuits are active against Cosby. Gloria Allred is representing 33 {{of the alleged}} victims. In July 2015, some of the court records from Andrea Constand's 2005 civil lawsuit against Cosby were unsealed and released to the public. The full transcript of his deposition was also released to the media by a court reporting service. In his testimony, Cosby admitted to casual sex, involving recreational use of the sedative-hypnotic <b>methaqualone</b> (Quaaludes), with a series of young women, and acknowledged that his dispensing the prescription drug was illegal.|$|E
500|$|In 1971, vocalist David Johansen {{formed the}} New York Dolls with guitarists Johnny Thunders and Rick Rivets, bassist Arthur Kane, and drummer Billy Murcia; Rivets was {{replaced}} by Sylvain Sylvain in 1972. The band {{was meant to be}} a temporary project for the members, who were club-going youths that had gone to New York City with different career pursuits. As Sylvain recalled, [...] "We just said 'Hey, maybe this will get us some chicks.' That seemed like a good enough reason." [...] He and Murcia originally planned to work in the clothing business and opened a boutique on Lexington Avenue that was across the street from a toy repair shop called the New York Dolls Hospital, which gave them the idea for their name. The group soon began playing regularly in lower Manhattan and earned a cult following within a few months with their reckless style of rock music. Nonetheless, record companies were hesitant to sign them because of their onstage cross-dressing and blatant vulgarity. In October 1972, they garnered the interest of critics when they opened for English rock band the Faces at the Empire Pool in Wembley. However, on the New York Dolls' first tour of England that year, Murcia died after consuming a lethal combination of alcohol and <b>methaqualone.</b> They enlisted Jerry Nolan as his replacement, while managers Marty Thau, Steve Leber, and David Krebs still struggled to find the band a record deal.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his book}} Kitchen Confidential, Anthony Bourdain says [...] "Hardly a {{decision}} was made without drugs. Cannabis, <b>methaqualone,</b> cocaine, LSD, psilocybin mushrooms soaked in honey and used to sweeten tea, secobarbital, tuinal, amphetamine, codeine and, increasingly, heroin, which we'd send a Spanish-speaking busboy over to Alphabet City to get." ...|$|E
2500|$|Callas {{spent her}} last years living largely in {{isolation}} in Paris {{and died of}} a heart attack at age 53 on September 16, 1977. Heart failure is a possible outcome of dermatomyositis or side effect of the steroids and immunosuppressants which she took for the disease. Another explanation offered is that Callas's death was due to heart failure brought on by (possibly unintentional) overuse of Mandrax (<b>methaqualone),</b> a sleeping aid.|$|E

2500|$|Silkwood {{said she}} had {{assembled}} documentation for her claims, including company papers. She decided {{to go public with}} this evidence, and contacted David Burnham, a New York Times journalist, who was interested in her story. On November 13, 1974, Silkwood left a union meeting at the Hub Cafe in Crescent. Another attendee of that meeting later testified that Silkwood had a binder and a packet of documents with her at the cafe. Silkwood got into her car and headed alone for Oklahoma City, about [...] away, to meet with Burnham, the New York Times reporter, and Steve Wodka, an official of her union's national office. Later that evening, Silkwood's body was found in her car, which had run off the road and struck a culvert {{on the east side of}} route 74, 0.11 miles (180 m) south of the intersection with West Industrial Road (35.855233°-97.584963°). The car contained none of the documents she held in the union meeting at the Hub cafe. [...] She was pronounced dead at the scene in what was believed to be an accident. The trooper at the scene remembers that he found one or two tablets of the sedative <b>methaqualone</b> (Quaalude) in the car, and he remembers finding marijuana. The police report indicated that she fell asleep at the wheel. The coroner found 0.35 milligrams of <b>methaqualone</b> per 100 milliliters of blood at the time of her death— an amount almost twice the recommended dosage for inducing drowsiness.|$|E
2500|$|While Vaughan {{asserted}} that he first experienced {{the effects of}} cocaine when a doctor prescribed him a liquid solution of the stimulant as a nasal spray, according to Patoski and Crawford, the earliest that Vaughan {{is known to have}} ingested the drug is in 1975, while performing with the Cobras. Before that, Vaughan had briefly used other drugs such as cannabis, methamphetamine, and Quaaludes, the brand name for <b>methaqualone.</b> After 1975, he regularly drank whiskey and used cocaine, particularly mixing the two substances together. According to Hopkins, by the time of Double Trouble's European tour in September 1986, [...] "his lifestyle of substance abuse had reached a peak, probably better characterized as the bottom of a deep chasm." ...|$|E

5000|$|The sedative-hypnotic {{activity}} of <b>methaqualone</b> was first noted by {{researchers in the}} 1950s. In 1962, <b>methaqualone</b> was patented in the US by Wallace and Tiernan.

50|$|<b>Methaqualone</b> is a {{depressant}} {{that increases}} {{the activity of the}} GABA receptors in the brain and nervous system. When GABA activity is increased, blood pressure drops and the breathing and pulse rates slow, leading to a state of deep relaxation. These properties explain why <b>methaqualone</b> was originally mainly prescribed for insomnia. <b>Methaqualone</b> peaks in the bloodstream within several hours, with a half-life of 20-60 hours. Regular users build up a physical tolerance, requiring larger doses for the same effect. Overdose can lead to nervous system shutdown, coma and death.|$|E
5000|$|Mecloqualone (Nubarene, Casfen) is a quinazolinone-class GABAergic {{and is an}} {{analogue}} of <b>methaqualone</b> {{that was}} first made in 1960 and marketed mainly in France and some other European countries. It has sedative, hypnotic, and anxiolytic properties caused by its agonist activity at the β subtype of the GABAa receptor, and {{was used for the}} treatment of insomnia. [...] Mecloqualone is faster-acting but shorter-lasting than <b>methaqualone</b> and so was used only as a sleeping pill, in contrast to <b>methaqualone,</b> which was used as a general-purpose anxiolytic as well. Mecloqualone was never as widely used as <b>methaqualone</b> and is no longer prescribed because of concerns about its potential for abuse and overdose. In the United States it is a Schedule I non-narcotic (depressant) controlled substance with an ACSCN of 2572 and zero annual aggregate manufacturing quota.|$|E
5000|$|As {{mentioned}} above, <b>methaqualone</b> is {{a common}} recreational and self-medication drug in South Africa and other of the former Frontline States, including Mozambique, Angola, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Some percentage of this consumption, {{as well as on}} the European and Near East clandestine drug markets, was/is in all probability sourced from the massive cache of powder and tabletted <b>methaqualone</b> produced under the aegis of the apartheid-era South African government's Project Coast in a segment thereof directed by Dr Wouter Basson (whose [...] "Brownies" [...] are capsules of pure MDMA in doses of up to 135 mg), who at one point was held by police in Croatia carrying $40m in Vatican bearer bonds when attempting to purchase 500 kilos of <b>methaqualone.</b> The <b>methaqualone</b> and MDMA, along with cocaine and other empathogens and aphrodisiacs as well as muscle relaxants and incapacitating anticholinergic deliriants were considered for non-lethal riot-control use.

5000|$|Gene Haislip, {{the former}} head of the Chemical Control Division of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), told the PBS {{documentary}} program Frontline: [...] "We beat 'em." [...] By working with governments and manufacturers around the world, the DEA was able to halt production and, Haislip says, [...] "eliminated the problem". <b>Methaqualone</b> was manufactured in the United States under the name Quaalude by the pharmaceutical firms Rorer and Lemmon with the numbers 714 stamped on the tablet, so people often referred to Quaalude as 714s, [...] "Lemmons", or [...] "Lemmon 7s". <b>Methaqualone</b> was also manufactured in the US under the trade names Sopor and Parest.

5000|$|<b>Methaqualone</b> (Quaaludes) became {{increasingly}} popular as a recreational {{drug in the}} late 1960s and 1970s, known variously as [...] "ludes" [...] or [...] "sopers" [...] (also [...] "soaps") in the U.S. and [...] "mandrakes" [...] and [...] "mandies" [...] in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. The drug was often used by hippies and by people who went dancing at glam rock clubs in the 1970s and at discos (one slang term for Quaaludes in the disco era was [...] "disco biscuits"). In the mid-1970s, there were bars in Manhattan called [...] "juice bars" [...] that only served non-alcoholic drinks that catered to people who liked to dance on <b>methaqualone.</b> Purported <b>methaqualone</b> is in a significant minority of cases found to be inert, or contain diphenhydramine or benzodiazepines. <b>Methaqualone</b> {{is one of the}} most commonly used recreational drugs in South Africa.

Apnea is a potential complication. Substances that may cause this toxidrome include anticonvulsants, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid, <b>Methaqualone,</b> and ethanol. While most sedative-hypnotics are anticonvulsant, some such as GHB and <b>methaqualone</b> instead lower the seizure threshold, and so can cause paradoxical seizures in overdose.|$|E
