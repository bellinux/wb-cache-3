40|$|Abstract Earthquakes are {{recurring}} {{natural phenomena}} that cause cumulative damage to earth constructions {{that can lead}} to their collapse. The discovery of earthen architectural heritage in Peru, has led to the re-exposure of adobe buildings, increasing their vulnerability to seismic activity. How can we prevent protect them from further damage their loss and? Due to their gradual and progressive destruction, earth constructions located in seismic areas constitute a critical and unique case. The structural response of stone masonry joined with mud mortar depends on the weakest of their construction materials: earth. This paper presents the criteria for structural conservation of earthen architectural heritage and tools for seismic-resistant reinforcement developed by field experts during the last 25 years. The concepts of reinforced earth and liquid <b>mud</b> <b>injection,</b> developed by the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PUCP) with support from the Getty Conservation Institute (GCI), are also included in this work. The article also analyzes recent cases of the re-intervention of earth monuments initially restored during the last century and re-destroyed by more recent earthquakes; offers solutions to this situation, ranging from the safest and friendliest to the most aggressive ones. Finally, I concludes expressing the urgent need to reassess the conservation criteria accepted by the International Charters ratified by ICOMOS and UNESCO regarding earthen architectural heritage located in seismic areas...|$|E
30|$|The {{effects of}} kick on the {{mass flow rate}} of the mud return for Run_ 1 and Run_ 2 are shown in Figs.  12 and 13, respectively. The mass flow rate {{responds}} instantaneously to gas influx entering the flow meter as shown by a surge in the mass flow rate of the return <b>mud.</b> The continuous <b>injection</b> of compressed air (influx) into the wellbore then causes erratic readings of the mass flow rate that, by observation, is on average higher in magnitude than the pre- and post-gas kick readings. The observed increase in the mass flow rate {{may be due to}} the increased mass velocity of the fluid caused by gas influx.|$|R

The breeding habits of fishes in nature differ from specie to specie Different species of fish choose different places in the aquatic environment for breeding. Most species do not breed when in captivity due to a number of factors. In Nigeria, induced breeding of African <b>mud</b> catfish through <b>injection</b> of ova prim hormone or pituitary gland is the main practice. This article reviews the wild sources of fish seeds, some cultivable fishes. carp breeding, relationship between the endocrine system and gonad development, function of the Central Nervous System (CNS) in propagation, influence of ecological conditions on gonad development, artificial propagation of common carp, natural induced spawning, salmon culture and an innovation in the sea to educate fish breeders, fish genetics and fish culturist in other to facilitate their productivity...|$|R

40|$|The {{examination}} of about eighty exposures of lucinid deposits of the Apennine chain based on new field analyses and previous data, and the compositional study {{of one hundred}} samples representative of the different geological settings in which lucinid assemblages are found, enable us to distinguish four types of deposits. Type 1 and type 2 are primary (autochthonous) deposits whereas type 3 and type 4 are secondary (allochthonous) deposits. Type 1 deposits consist of marly-calcareous and calcarenitic lenses or columnar bodies, jammed with articulated lucinid-like shells, usually belonging to oligotypic communities and grading into the surrounding pelitic sediments. Most of the samples are made of homogeneous micrites, biomiocrites and fossiliferous micrites, containing variable amounts of biogenic particles, chiefly planktonic foraminifera. Type 2 deposits {{are made up of}} lucinid shells, either isolated or associated with a more diverse fauna, in mudstones, marls, arenitic and calcareous marls. Type 3 deposits are constituted of carbonate olistoliths enclosed as blocks within chaotic horizons in turbiditic and hemipelagic formations of the Miocene foredeep. Type 4 deposits are represented by coquina debris, isolated articulated or disarticulated shells in resedimented arenites, calcarenites, carbonate breccias with biogenic debris. Samples of secondary deposits show a noticeable variety of lithologies and textures and are very heterogeneous even at the microscopic scale. The most common lithotypes include fine to medium grained arenites characterized by a loosely detrital fabric and by a pervasive micrite cement. Fossiliferous micrites and biomicrites with brecciated textures are common. The detrital framework show striking similarities to the composition of the host turbidites. Carbonate intraclasts and clasts deriving from lithotypes of the ligurian domain are present. Most of the type 1 and 3 deposits are strongly 13 C depleted and are interpreted as chemosynthetic communities (chemoherms), with authigenic carbonate deposition related to methane-rich fluid venting. Type 1 deposits occur only in thick pelitic sediments belonging to the satellite (Termina Formation of the epiligurian sequence) and to the foredeep basins (Vicchio and Letto Marls). Type 2 deposits are instead related to normal marine conditions, whereas the type 4 could have their source from all the other types of deposits. Secondary lucinid deposits occur {{in a wide range of}} different tectonic setting, from backland to foreland, with a concentration in the middle Miocene foredeep. The secondary lucinid deposits of the foredeep turbidites evidenced several different grades of allochthony and multiple provenances. Lucinid deposits in the Marnoso-arenacea turbidites show evidence of a moderate reworking, probably from the enclosed pelitic horizons or from adjacent slope pelites. The source of the oldest chemoherms seems to be represented by the Vicchio Marls, whereas isolated shells and coquina debris in resedimented beds of the minor basins and Cervarola foredeep probably originate from satellite basins or from methane-derived biological communities located in fine-grained horizons no longer preserved. The peculiar brecciated structures observed in many lucinid chemoherms are probably the result of a number of superimposed processes, involving fluidization of sediments and reworking for gravity mass transport. <b>Mud</b> diapirism and/or <b>injection,</b> related to overpressuring of sediments due to methanogenic fluid venting, could account for the formation of the brecciated structures resembling those related to gravity flow processes. Fluidization of sediments may also represent an important mechanism able to increase the instability of pelitic marly sediments, thus favouring gravity slumping processes...|$|R
