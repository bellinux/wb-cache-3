The LAB identified in viili including Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar. diacetylactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris. Among those mesophilic LAB strains, the slime-forming Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris produce a phosphate-containing heteropolysaccharide, named viilian. Viilian is similar to kefiran produced by kefir grains. The production of exopolysaccharides (EPS) by the strain forms the consistency character of viili {{and it has been}} claimed to have various functional benefits toward the rheological properties of milk products and the health improving potential.|$|E

Aim: To evaluate the long term acceptability, tolerance and consumption of the <b>Milk</b> <b>Beverage</b> and analyze the nutritional contribution of the products provided by the supplementation program to the usual diet of the elderly. Material and methods: One hundred twenty five elderly subjects, aged 77 ± 4 (52 males) living in Metropolitan Santiago, aged over 70 years, beneficiaries of the food supplementation program, were interviewed. The acceptability, consumption and tolerance of the <b>Milk</b> <b>Beverage</b> were evaluated by specially designed surveys.

Fluoride concentration was assessed by an ion specific electrode after hexamethyldisiloxane-facilitated diffusion, and calcium and phosphorus concentrations were assessed by a colorimetric test using a spectrophotometer. Sixty specimens of bovine enamel were randomly assigned to 6 groups (n = 10). They were exposed to 4 cycles of demineralization in the fermented milk and remineralization in artificial saliva. Enamel mineral loss was determined by surface microhardness (%SMHC) and profilometric tests.

METHODS - This randomized, double-blind controlled trial included 49 female patients aged 20 to 50 years and diagnosed with constipation according to the ROME III criteria (Diagnostic Criteria for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders) and the Bristol Stool Form Scale. The patients were randomized into two groups: the intervention group received the probiotic fermented <b>milk</b> <b>beverage</b> and the control group received non-probiotic milk.

The Wilcoxon test was used to evaluate pre and post-intervention results of the ROME III criteria and Bristol scale. The statistical significance level was considered as 5 % (P ≤ 0. 05). RESULTS - The intervention group showed improvement in the following criteria: straining during a bowel movement (P < 0. 001), feeling of incomplete evacuation (P < 0. 001) and difficulty in passing stool (P < 0. 014), in addition to Bristol scale results (P < 0. 001).
