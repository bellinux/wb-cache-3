Overall the newly designed model is fed by physical inputs which are highly researched and developed several times. This model is capable to remove all the difficulties of previously proposed and designed models. The necessity of implementing this type of structure is to encounter absence of dielectric in the CMOS structure[1]. As we remember structure of MOSFET; there Si was implanted beneath the gate and this oxide layer actually acts as the dielectric material alike to any capacitor. Actually there is no provision to implement such kind of dielectric during the fabrication process of the MESFET. Observing this analogical difference it is planned that if somehow any kind of dielectric material which is nearer to the oxide layer, implanted in the MOSFET during fabrication, is planted in the gate terminal without hampering the fabricated structure the device will analogically same as the MOSFET.

40|$|The success {{probability}} in an ancilla <b>based</b> <b>circuit</b> generally decreases exponentially in {{the number}} of qubits consisted in the ancilla. Although the probability can be amplified through the amplitude amplification process, the input dependence of the amplitude amplification makes difficult to sequentially combine two or more ancilla <b>based</b> <b>circuits.</b> A new version of the amplitude amplification known as the oblivious amplitude amplification runs independently of the input to the system register. This allow us to to sequentially combine two or more ancilla <b>based</b> <b>circuits.</b> However, this type of the amplification only works when the considered system is unitary or non-unitary but somehow close to a unitary. In this paper, we present a general framework to simulate non-unitary matrices on ancilla <b>based</b> quantum <b>circuits</b> in which the success probability is maximized by using the oblivious amplitude amplification. In particular, we show how to extend a non-unitary matrix to an almost unitary matrix. We then simulate the extended matrix by using an ancilla <b>based</b> <b>circuit</b> design along with the oblivious amplitude amplification. Measuring the distance of the produced matrix to the closest unitary unitary matrix, a lower bound for the fidelity of the final state obtained from the oblivious amplitude amplification process is presented. Numerical simulations for random matrices of different sizes show that independent of the system size, the final amplified probabilities are generally around 0. 75 and the fidelity of the final state is mostly high and around 0. 95. Furthermore, we discuss the complexity analysis and show that combining two such ancilla <b>based</b> <b>circuits,</b> a matrix product can be implemented. This may lead us to efficiently implement matrix functions represented as infinite matrix products on quantum computers...|$|R

The use of a PIN diode in the linearizer provides it with an extra level of freedom in achieving the desired characteristic. Overall, the linearizer is equipped with three degrees of freedom and hence possesses the capability to achieve output characteristics that can be employed in linearizing various types of power amplifiers.

40|$|Silicon <b>based</b> {{integrated}} <b>circuit</b> (IC) {{technology is}} approaching its physical limits. For sub 10 nm technology nodes, the carbon nanotube (CNT) based {{field effect transistor}} {{has emerged as a}} promising device because of its excellent electronic properties. One of the major challenges faced by the CNT technology is the unwanted growth of metallic tubes. At present, there is no known CNT fabrication technology which allows the fabrication of 100 % semiconducting CNTs. The presence of metallic tubes creates a short between the drain and source terminals of the transistor and has a detrimental impact on the delay, static power and yield of CNT based gates. This thesis will address the challenge of designing robust carbon nanotube <b>based</b> <b>circuits</b> in the presence of metallic tubes. For a small percentage of metallic tubes, circuit level solutions are proposed to increase the functional yield of CNT based gates in the presence of metallic tubes. Accurate analytical models with less than a 3 % inaccuracy rate are developed to estimate the yield of CNT <b>based</b> <b>circuit</b> for a different percentage of metallic tubes and different drive strengths of logic gates. Moreover, a design methodology is developed for yield-aware carbon nanotube <b>based</b> <b>circuits</b> in the presence of metallic tubes using different CNFET transistor configurations. Architecture based on regular logic bricks with underlying hybrid CNFET configurations are developed which gives better trade-offs in terms of performance, power, and functional yield. In the case when the percentage of metallic tubes is large, the proposed circuit level techniques are not sufficient. Extra processing techniques must be applied to remove the metallic tubes. The tube removal techniques have trade-offs, as the removal process is not perfect and removes semiconducting tubes in addition to removing unwanted metallic tubes. As a result, stochastic removal of tubes from the drive and fanout gate(s) results in large variation in the performance of CNFET based gates and in the worst case open circuit gates. A Monte Carlo simulation engine is developed to estimate the impact of the removal of tubes on the performance and power of CNFET based logic gates. For a quick estimation of functional yield of logic gates, accurate analytical models are developed to estimate the functional yield of logic gates when a fraction of the tubes are removed. An efficient tube level redundancy (TLR) is proposed, resulting in a high functional yield of carbon nanotube <b>based</b> <b>circuits</b> with minimal overheads in terms of area and power when large fraction of tubes are removed. Furthermore, for applications where parallelism can be utilized we propose to increase the functional yield of the CNFET <b>based</b> <b>circuits</b> by increasing the logic depth of gates...|$|R
