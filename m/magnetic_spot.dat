40|$|We explore {{magnetic}} field configurations {{that lead to}} the formation of magnetic spots on the surface of neutron stars and the displacement of the magnetic dipole axis. We find that a toroidally dominated {{magnetic field}} is essential for the generation of a single spot with a strong magnetic field. Once a spot forms, it survives for several million years, even after the total magnetic field has decayed significantly. We find that the dipole axis is not stationary with respect to the neutron star's surface and does not in general coincide with the location of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>spot.</b> This is due to non-axisymmetric instabilities of the toroidal field that displace the poloidal dipole axis at rates that may reach 0 fdg 4 per century. A misaligned poloidal dipole axis with the toroidal field leads to more significant displacement of the dipole axis than the fully aligned case. Finally we discuss the evolution of neutron stars with such magnetic fields on the P [...] Ṗ diagram and the observational implications. We find that neutron stars spend a very short time before they cross the Death Line of the P [...] Ṗ diagram, compared to their characteristic ages. Moreover, the maximum intensity of their surface magnetic field is substantially higher than the dipole component of the field. We argue that SGR 0418 + 5729 could be an example of this type of behavior, having a weak dipole field, yet hosting a <b>magnetic</b> <b>spot</b> responsible for its magnetar behavior.

40|$|The radio pulsar models {{based on}} the {{existence}} of an inner accelerating gap located above the polar cap rely {{on the existence of}} a small scale, strong surface magnetic field B_s. This field exceeds the dipolar field B_d, responsible for the braking of the pulsar rotation, by at least one order of magnitude. Neither magnetospheric currents nor small scale field components generated during neutron star's birth can provide such field structures in old pulsars. While the former are too weak to create B_s ≳ 5 × 10 ^ 13 G ≫ B_d, the ohmic decay time of the latter is much shorter than 10 ^ 6 years. We suggest that a large amount of magnetic energy is stored in a toroidal field component that is confined in deeper layers of the crust, where the ohmic decay time exceeds 10 ^ 7 years.

40|$|Rotation {{evolution}} of late-type stars {{is dominated by}} magnetic braking and the underlying factors that control this angular momentum loss are important {{for the study of}} stellar spin-down. In this work, we study angular momentum loss as a function of two different aspects of magnetic activity using a calibrated Alfvén wave-driven magnetohydrodynamic wind model: the strengths of <b>magnetic</b> <b>spots</b> and their distribution in latitude. By driving the model using solar and modified solar surface magnetograms, we show that the topology of the field arising from the net interaction of both small-scale and large-scale field is important for spin-down rates and that angular momentum loss is not a simple function of large scale magnetic field strength. We find that changing the latitude of <b>magnetic</b> <b>spots</b> can modify mass and angular momentum loss rates by a factor of two. The general effect that causes these differences is the closing down of large-scale open field at mid- and high-latitudes by the addition of the small-scale field. These effects might give rise to modulation of mass and angular momentum loss through stellar cycles, and present a problem for ab initio attempts to predict stellar spin-down based on wind models. For all the magnetogram cases considered here, from dipoles to various spotted distributions, we find that angular momentum loss is dominated by the mass loss at mid-latitudes. The spin-down torque applied by magnetized winds therefore acts at specific latitudes and is not evenly distributed over the stellar surface, though this aspect is unlikely to be important for understanding spin-down and surface flows on stars.

We suggest that reduced convective efficiency, due to fast rotation and large field strengths, and/or to <b>magnetic</b> <b>spot</b> coverage of the radiating surface significantly affect their evolution, leading to a reduced heat flux and thus larger radii and cooler effective temperatures than for regular objects.

40|$|Recent work by Mitra et al. (2014) {{has shown}} that in {{strongly}} stratified forced two-layer turbulence with helicity and corresponding large-scale dynamo action in the lower layer, a magnetic field occurs in the upper layer {{in the form of}} sharply bounded bipolar magnetic spots. Here we extend this model to spherical wedge geometry covering the northern hemisphere up to 75 latitude and an azimuthal extent of 180. The kinetic helicity and therefore also the large-scale magnetic field are strongest at low latitudes. For moderately strong stratification, several bipolar spots form that fill eventually the full longitudinal extent. At early times, the polarity of spots reflects the orientation of the underlying azimuthal field, as expected from Ω-shaped flux loops. At late times their tilt changes such that there is a radial field of opposite orientation at different latitudes separated by about 10. Our model demonstrates the spontaneous formation of spots of sizes much larger than the pressure scale height. Their tendency to produce filling factors close to unity is argued to be reminiscent of highly active stars.

In this lecture I shall first discuss the magnetic suppression of convection in the spots, and then I shall try to explain the pulsation phenomenon, reviewing some of the suggestions that have been made to explain the alignment and the excitation mechanism, and finally raising some issues that need to be addressed.

40|$|Hot {{luminous}} stars show {{a variety}} of phenomena in their photospheres and in their winds which still lack clear physical explanations at this time. Among these phenomena are non-thermal line broadening, line profile variability (LPVs), discrete absorption components (DACs), wind clumping and stochastically excited pulsations. Cantiello et al. (2009) argued that a convection zone {{close to the surface}} of hot, massive stars, could be responsible for some of these phenomena. This convective zone is caused by a peak in the opacity due to iron recombination and for this reason is referred as the "iron convection zone" (FeCZ). 3 D MHD simulations are used to explore the possible effects of such subsurface convection on the surface properties of hot, massive stars. We argue that turbulence and localized <b>magnetic</b> <b>spots</b> at the surface are the likely consequence of subsurface convection in early type stars.

40|$|Any {{model for}} the {{formation}} of elliptical planetary nebulae (PNs) should account for the positive correlation between the mass loss rate and the degree of departure from sphericity of the AGB progenitor’s wind. I propose that this correlation results from dust formation above <b>magnetic</b> cool <b>spots.</b> The model deals with elliptical PNs, but not with bipolar PNs. The basic assumption is that a weak dynamo amplifies magnetic fields in AGB stars, such that <b>magnetic</b> cool <b>spots</b> are formed, mainly near the equatorial plane. Enhanced dust formation above these cool spots leads to a higher mass loss rate in the equatorial plane, resulting in the formation of an elliptical PN. The dust formation above cool spots becomes much more efficient when mass loss rate is high. In addition to explaining the correlation, the model has the advantage that it can operate for very slowly rotating AGB stars, having rotation velocities of less than 10 − 4 times the break-up velocity. Such velocities can be achieved by a planet companion of mass ∼ 0. 1 MJupiter which spins-up the envelope, or even from singly evolved stars which leave the main sequence with a high rotation velocity. The sporadic nature of <b>magnetic</b> cool <b>spots</b> also leads to the formation of filaments, arcs, and clumps in the descendant PN. The model cannot explain the presence of jets and ansae in elliptical PNs. These are attributed to the destruction of a planet or brown dwarf on the AGB core. – 2 – 1...|$|R
