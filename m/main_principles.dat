25|$|Chromatography {{technique}} developed substantially as {{a result}} of the work of Archer John Porter Martin and Richard Laurence Millington Synge during the 1940s and 1950s, for which they won the 1952 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. They established the principles and basic techniques of partition chromatography, and their work encouraged the rapid development of several chromatographic methods: paper chromatography, gas chromatography, and what would become known as high-performance liquid chromatography. Since then, the technology has advanced rapidly. Researchers found that the <b>main</b> <b>principles</b> of Tsvet's chromatography could be applied in many different ways, resulting in the different varieties of chromatography described below. Advances are continually improving the technical performance of chromatography, allowing the separation of increasingly similar molecules.|$|E

25|$|One of the <b>main</b> <b>principles</b> of Interslavic {{is that it}} can {{be written}} on any Slavic keyboard. The border between Latin and Cyrillic runs through the middle of Slavic territory, and {{therefore}} both alphabets can be used. Because of the differences between for example the Polish alphabet and other Latin alphabets, as well as between Serbian/Macedonian Cyrillic and other forms of Cyrillic, Interslavic has no official orthography, but uses a prototype orthography instead, which means that many phonemes can be written and pronounced in various ways. For example, the distinction between hard and soft consonants (t vs. ť, r vs. ŕ, etc.), characteristic for the West and East Slavic languages, is optional both in speaking and in writing. Because Interslavic is not an ethnic language, there are no severe rules regarding accentuation either.|$|E

The Ministers took note of the broader objectives of the European Union proposed Registration, Evaluation and Authorization and restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Legislation, in respect of the protection of human health and the environment. They expressed their concern for the consequences REACH may have on the developing economies of the South. Such consequences will negatively affect the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals in these countries. The ministers urged the EU to give due consideration to these consequences and also ensure that REACH does not become a Technical Barrier to Trade (TBT).|$|E
25|$|In 1992 a {{copyright}} case Qimron v.

Qimron's suit against the Biblical Archaeology Society was done {{on the grounds that}} the research they had published was his intellectual property as he had reconstructed about 40% of the published text. In 1993, the district court Judge Dalia Dorner ruled for the plaintiff, Elisha Qimron, in context of both United States and Israeli copyright law and granted the highest compensation allowed by law for aggravation in compensation against Hershel Shanks and others. In an appeal in 2000 in front of Judge Aharon Barak, the verdict was upheld in Israeli Supreme Court in Qimron's favor. The court case established the two <b>main</b> <b>principles</b> from which facsimiles are examined under copyright law of the United States and Israel: authorship and originality.|$|E

500|$|Hellenic Nomarchy ( [...] The Greek rule of law) was a {{pamphlet}} written by [...] "Anonymous the Greek" [...] published and printed in Italy in 1806.

Its author, arguing for both social autonomy and national sovereignty, supported the Greek struggle for national liberation {{and turned to the}} moral greatness of ancient Greece in order to stimulate collective pride. Although this work was widely read by Greeks before the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence in 1821, from its first appearance it was received with discomfort by contemporary scholars, and generated debates on the identity of its author.|$|E
