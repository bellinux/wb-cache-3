40|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of microwave <b>direction</b> <b>finders</b> which operate under a variety of conditions and signal environments, but they can be divided into two major classes: (a) scanning, and (b) non-scanning. This paper discusses non-scanning multichannel amplitude-comparison systems, and in particular, systems using wide band antennas with crystal-video receivers to indicate the bearing of pulsed signals instantaneously. The accuracy of this type of <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> can be improved by increasing the number of channels. The characteristics of <b>direction</b> <b>finders</b> in which there are more channels in the radio-frequency portion of the system than in the video portion were studied with an analogue of a <b>direction</b> <b>finder.</b> The results of the analogue studies were applied in the development of an improved microwave antenna system for a tactical <b>direction</b> <b>finder.</b> The construction and performance of this antenna system are discussed.

40|$|Automatic {{locating}} systems which {{respond to}} cloud to ground lightning and which discriminate against cloud discharges and background noise are described. Subsystems of the locating system, {{which include the}} <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> and the position analyzer, are discussed. The <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> senses the electromagnetic fields radiated by lightning on two orthogonal magnetic loop antennas and on a flat plate electric antenna. The position analyzer is a preprogrammed microcomputer system which automatically computes, maps, and records lightning locations in real time using data inputs from the <b>direction</b> <b>finder.</b> The use of the locating systems for wildfire management and fire weather forecasting is discussed...|$|R

25|$|A Bellini–Tosi <b>{{direction}}</b> <b>finder</b> (B–T or BTDF) {{is a type}} {{of radio}} <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> (RDF), which determines the direction to, or bearing of, a radio transmitter. Earlier RDF systems used very large rotating loop antennae, which the B–T system replaced with two fixed antennae and a small rotating loop, known as a radiogoniometer.
