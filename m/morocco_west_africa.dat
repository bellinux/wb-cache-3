[...] As Captain and Expedition Leader, Erin led the 2001-2004 Voyage of Makulu, the flagship activity of Reach the World. The expedition members researched environmental science, geography, and livelihood topics and created curricular content for partner classrooms in the United States. The voyage began {{and ended in}} New York city and followed the standard antipodal circumnavigation route going westwards, visiting such areas as the Caribbean Islands, the Panama Canal, the Galapagos Islands, Polynesia, Australia, Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka, the Gulf of Aden, the Red Sea, the Suez Canal, the Mediterranean Sea, <b>Morocco,</b> <b>West</b> <b>Africa,</b> the Cape Verde Islands, and Bermuda.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{molecular}} epidemiology of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant (3 GC-R) Klebsiella pneumoniae {{in developing countries}} is poorly documented. From February 2007 to March 2008, we collected 135 3 GC-R K.  pneumoniae isolates from seven major towns in Maghreb (<b>Morocco),</b> <b>West</b> <b>Africa</b> (Senegal, Côte d'Ivoire), Central Africa (Cameroon), East Africa (Madagascar) and Southeast Asia (Vietnam). Their genetic diversity, assessed by multilocus sequence typing, was high (60 sequence types), reflecting multiclonality. However, two major clonal groups, CG 15 (n =  23, 17 % of isolates) and CG 258 (n =  18, 13 %), were detected in almost all participating centres. The two major clonal groups have previously been described {{in other parts of}} the world, indicating their global spread. The high diversity of enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence-PCR banding patterns at the local level indicates that most isolates were epidemiologically unrelated. The isolates were characterized by the presence of multiple resistance determinants, most notably the concomitant presence of the aac(6 ') -Ib-cr, qnr and bla(CTX-M- 15) genes in 61 isolates (45 %) belonging to 31 sequence types. These isolates were detected across a large geographical area including Cameroon (n =  1), Vietnam (n =  4), Madagascar (n =  10), Côte d'Ivoire (n =  12), Morocco (n =  13) and Senegal (n =  21).

40|$|The international, {{interdisciplinary}} biodiversity {{research project}} BIOTA AFRICA initiated a standardized biodiversity monitoring network along climatic gradients across the African continent. Due to an identified {{lack of adequate}} monitoring designs, BIOTA AFRICA developed and implemented the standardized BIOTA Biodiversity Observatories, that meet the following criteria (a) enable long-term monitoring of biodiversity, potential driving factors, and relevant indicators with adequate spatial and temporal resolution, (b) facilitate comparability of data generated within different ecosystems, (c) allow integration of many disciplines, (d) allow spatial up-scaling, and (e) be applicable within a network approach. A BIOTA Observatory encompasses an area of 1 km 2 and is subdivided into 100 1 -ha plots. For {{meeting the needs of}} sampling of different organism groups, the hectare plot is again subdivided into standardized subplots, whose sizes follow a geometric series. To allow for different sampling intensities {{but at the same time}} to characterize the whole square kilometer, the number of hectare plots to be sampled depends on the requirements of the respective discipline. A hierarchical ranking of the hectare plots ensures that all disciplines monitor as many hectare plots jointly as possible. The BIOTA Observatory design assures repeated, multidisciplinary standardized inventories of biodiversity and its environmental drivers, including options for spatial up- and downscaling and different sampling intensities. BIOTA Observatories have been installed along climatic and landscape gradients in <b>Morocco,</b> <b>West</b> <b>Africa,</b> and southern Africa. In regions with varying land use, several BIOTA Observatories are situated close to each other to analyze management effects. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B. V...|$|E
