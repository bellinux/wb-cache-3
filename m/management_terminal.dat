Some of them comforted their children in the home-care context once their children reached the point where no other treatment could help. At the same time, they tried to establish effective relationships with health professionals, especially physicians. One third of the mothers gave the initiative to the physician, but almost half of the mothers shared the initiative to some degree with physicians on an equal or dominant-subordinate basis. Whether the mothers trusted the physicians did not relate to whether they shared the initiative or not, but was a primary factor in deciding whether to change hospitals.
