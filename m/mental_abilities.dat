5|$|Huntington's disease (HD), {{also known}} as Huntington's chorea, is an {{inherited}} disorder that results in death of brain cells. The earliest symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or <b>mental</b> <b>abilities.</b> A general lack of coordination and an unsteady gait often follow. As the disease advances, uncoordinated, jerky body movements become more apparent. Physical abilities gradually worsen until coordinated movement becomes difficult and the person is unable to talk. <b>Mental</b> <b>abilities</b> generally decline into dementia. The specific symptoms vary somewhat between people. Symptoms usually begin between 30 and 50 years of age, but can start at any age. The disease may develop earlier in life in each successive generation. About 8% of cases start {{before the age of}} 20 years and typically present with symptoms more similar to Parkinson's disease. People with HD often underestimate the degree of their problems.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} examples of genre science fiction that involves a challenging amount of unconventional sexual activity is the early novel Odd John (1935), by Olaf Stapledon. John is a mutant with extraordinary <b>mental</b> <b>abilities</b> who will not allow himself to be bound {{by many of the}} rules imposed by the ordinary British society of his time. The novel strongly implies that he seduces an older boy who becomes devoted to him but also suffers from the affront that the relationship creates to his own morals.|$|E

Multiple linear regression analysis showed that MFI was significantly related to gender, age, educational level, and work type. Higher MFI and lower PSI predicted a better psychological work performance, even after adjusted for gender, age, educational level, and work type.

5|$|Abra uses various extrasensory powers, {{even when}} sleeping. With {{the ability to}} read minds, they can sense danger, teleporting when it does and can do so quickly enough to create visual doubles. Using self-hypnosis, Abra spends 18 hours a day sleeping, unable to utilize its telekinesis unless rested. This {{behavior}} ceases once it evolves into Kadabra, a strong psychic that emits alpha waves affected by its current mental state. These waves can trigger headaches in nearby people and can cause machines to malfunction. Once it evolves into Alakazam, it has mastered every type and form of psychic ability, and its brain continually grows. This causes its head to become too heavy for its neck, requiring telekinesis to hold it upright. Able to remember everything that it has experienced since hatching as an Abra, Alakazam has an IQ that exceeds 5,000 and can outperform a supercomputer. Both Kadabra and Alakazam utilize spoons generated mentally to enhance their abilities, two for the latter, and can increase them further by closing their eyes. Upon Mega Evolving, Mega Alakazam's <b>mental</b> <b>abilities</b> become even more pronounced due to it manifesting an organ on its forehead that emits psychic power. It also manifests three additional spoons alongside the two it possessed as Alakazam. Kadabra and Alakazam can engage in precognition, while all three Pokémon in the evolution line are capable of creating spaces where battle factors are affected.|$|E
5|$|Having been conscripted {{into the}} Confederate Ghost {{program as a}} child due to her psychic potential, Kerrigan is {{described}} in the manual for StarCraft as never having been given the chance for a normal life. Her rigorous training {{and the use of}} neural implants to control her <b>mental</b> <b>abilities</b> leave her withdrawn and introverted. Despite this, Kerrigan exhibits qualities of courage and daring, and is an effective tactician. She is also described as a moral character, exemplified in her opposition to Arcturus Mengsk using the Zerg against the Confederacy. However, after her transformation by the Zerg, Kerrigan is freed from her inhibitions—as well as her neural conditioning—and indulges her darker traits (though Heart of the Swarm implies that at least part of her villainy was due to the influence of a fallen Xel'naga named Amon). Her attitude, combined with her natural intelligence, makes her extremely calculating and manipulative. A hint of her former moral sensitivity is to be noted when {{towards the end of the}} Zerg campaign of Brood War, she states how she feels weary of slaughter for the first time since her transformation. Kerrigan has also become far more physically aggressive, relishing close quarters combat so much that at one point in the novel Queen of Blades, she begins absent-mindedly licking the blood of her victims from her fingers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Status {{attainment}} {{research has}} shown that people’s <b>mental</b> <b>ability</b> (intelligence) is an important determinant of their career success in western societies. But so far, no study has investigated the impact of <b>mental</b> <b>ability</b> on career success in Estonia. The present paper analyzes a longitudinal data-set from Estonia to fill this gap and compares the results with a similar data-set from the United States. The impact of <b>mental</b> <b>ability</b> is compared to the impact of social origin. Success is conceptualized as education, occupation and income of an individual. The analyses demonstrate that both <b>mental</b> <b>ability</b> and social origin {{have a positive effect on}} success in Estonia and the United States.

Our aim is to reveal the relationship between non-rapid eye movement sleep-specific oscillations (the slow oscillation, delta activity, slow and fast sleep spindle density, the grouping of slow and fast sleep spindles) and general <b>mental</b> <b>ability</b> assessed by the Raven Progressive Matrices Test (RPMT). The grouping of fast sleep spindles by the cortical slow oscillation in the left frontopolar derivation (Fp 1) as well as the density of fast sleep spindles over the right frontal area (Fp 2, F 4), correlated positively with general <b>mental</b> <b>ability.</b> Data from those selected electrodes that showed the high correlations with general <b>mental</b> <b>ability</b> explained almost 70 % of interindividual variance in RPMT scores.

40|$|The {{psychological}} {{refractory period}} (PRP) {{refers to a}} delay of response times (RT) to the second of two stimuli when these stimuli are presented in rapid succession. If this limitation of rapidly processing the second stimulus contributes to the well-known differences in speed of information processing between individuals with higher and lower <b>mental</b> <b>ability,</b> individuals with lower <b>mental</b> <b>ability</b> should exhibit a more pronounced PRP effect than individuals with higher <b>mental</b> <b>ability.</b> Previous studies on this question, however, yielded inconsistent results. In the present study, we assessed mental ability-related differences in the PRP by measuring lateralized readiness potentials (LRPs) to separate premotor and motor aspects of speed of information processing in 95 individuals with higher and 95 individuals with lower <b>mental</b> <b>ability.</b> Although individuals with higher <b>mental</b> <b>ability</b> processed information faster than individuals with lower <b>mental</b> <b>ability</b> as indicated by shorter RTs and shorter premotor LRP latencies, the PRP effect was equally pronounced in both groups.

50|$|There {{were some}} great {{contributors}} to social class attainment and social class mobility {{in the twentieth}} century: Both social class attainment and social mobility are influenced by pre-existing levels of <b>mental</b> <b>ability,</b> which was in consistence with other studies. So, the role of individual level <b>mental</b> <b>ability</b> in pursuit of educational attainment - professional positions require specific educational credentials. Furthermore, educational attainment contributes to social class attainment through the contribution of <b>mental</b> <b>ability</b> to educational attainment. Even further, <b>mental</b> <b>ability</b> can contribute to social class attainment independent of actual educational attainment, as in when the educational attainment is prevented, individuals with higher <b>mental</b> <b>ability</b> manage {{to make use of}} the <b>mental</b> <b>ability</b> to work their way up on the social ladder. This study made clear that intergenerational transmission of educational attainment is one of the key ways in which social class was maintained within family, and there was also evidence that education attainment was increasing over time. Finally, the results suggest that social mobility (moving upward and downward) has increased in recent years in Britain. Which according to one researcher is important because an overall mobility of about 22% is needed to keep the distribution of intelligence relatively constant from one generation to the other within each occupational category.|$|R

The 1921 born Midspan participants were matched with the computerized SMS 1932 database, and in total, 1032 of 1251 people (82. 5 %) were matched successfully. Of those matched, 938 (90. 9 %) had a <b>mental</b> <b>ability</b> test score recorded. The mean score of the matched sample was 37. 2 (standard deviation (SD) 13. 9) out of a possible score of 76.

The tests conducted were on vocabulary, spatial rotation, verbal fluency and inductive reasoning. Roberto Colom in 2002 found that males' IQs were 3.16 points higher on the WAIS III test, but {{that there was no}} difference on the general intelligence factor (g) and therefore explained the differences as due to non-g factors such as specific group factors and test specificity. Responding to findings by Richard Lynn in 2002, researchers Roberto Colom and Oscar Garcia Lopez proposed that g factor is the variance of correlation among different IQ tests and not the sum of group scores published by Lynn in his studies. So measuring variance of Colom's study of 4,072 high school graduates, they found that females outperform males on the inductive Primary <b>Mental</b> <b>Abilities</b> reasoning test, males outperform females on the Raven's Progressive Matrices and that there is no difference on the Culture-Fair intelligence test and therefore concluded no difference in general intelligence. Using multi-group covariance and mean group structure analysis in 2006, researchers Sophie van der Sluis, Conor V. Dolan and Roberto Colom found that g factor couldn't explain any sex differences on the WAIS III. Later that year in another study, the same researchers concluded that sex differences on WAIS are due to primary factors or broad stratum abilities like working memory and perceptual organization not g factor. A study conducted by Jim Flynn and Lilia Rossi-Case (2011) found that men and women achieved roughly equal IQ scores on Raven's Progressive Matrices after reviewing recent standardization samples in five modernized nations. In 2010, researcher Emily Savage-McGlynn proposed that inconsistent results in sex differences are due to opportunity samples rather than samples that represent the general population. After a study with a nationally representative sample of 926 participants in the UK, no sex difference was found in the Raven's Progressive Matrices test.|$|E

METHODS: We used {{data from a}} prospective observational study involving 8170 members of a birth cohort from Great Britain born in 1970. Data included <b>mental</b> <b>ability</b> scores at age 10 years and responses to inquiries about alcohol intake and problems at age 30 years. RESULTS: After adjustment for potential mediating and confounding factors, cohort members with higher childhood <b>mental</b> <b>ability</b> scores had an increased prevalence of problem drinking in adulthood. This association was stronger among women (odds ratio [OR](1 SD increase in ability) = 1. 38; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 16, 1. 64) than men (OR(1 SD increase in ability) = 1. 17; CI = 1. 04, 1. 28; P for interaction =. 004).

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 This {{investigation}} {{was designed to}} analyze change in critical. thinking between students in laboratory-centered and lecture-demonstration-centered patterns of instruction in high school biology. Twenty biology classes {{were randomly selected from}} the four senior high schools in the Salt Lake City School District. Class enrollment ranged from nine students in one class to thirty-six in another. Of the twenty classes selected, ten were randomly selected and taught by the lecture-demonstration-centered patterns of instruction; the remaining ten classes were taught by laboratory-centered patterns of instruction. Sixteen teachers taught the twenty classes. The students participated in a pre-testing program during {{the first two weeks of}} December 1964. The testing program provided statistical basis for general scholastic ability with a pre-test knowledge of the understanding of science; critical thinking; and attitudes of open and closed mindedness. Final testing was conducted during the first two weeks of May 1965, to determine the students' gains in these areas during the school year. Each group of ten classes used the same course of study. The course materials consisted of two Laboratory Blocks developed by the BSCS. Plant Growth and Development and Animal Growth and Development were the blocks used. The course materials were the same, the teaching methods were different. Data used in this study were obtained from five tests. They were: Otis Quick Scoring <b>Mental</b> <b>Ability</b> Test, Gamma: Form Am, Watson- Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal, Form Ym, Cornell Critical Thinking Test, Form X, Dogmatism Scale, Form E, Test on Understanding Science, Form W. The following conclusions were drawn from the data analyzed in this investigation. 1. The change in critical thinking and understanding of science of students in the laboratory-centered patterns of instruction was significant for all levels of intelligence at the 0. 5 percent level. There was no significant change in critical thinking and understanding science of students in the lecture-demonstration-centered patterns of instruction. 2. Evidence was obtained indicating a moderate correlation, but substantial relationship between change in critical thinking and change in understanding science. 3. Evidence was obtained to indicate that there was no relationship between a student's <b>mental</b> <b>ability</b> and change in critical thinking. Students with high <b>mental</b> <b>ability</b> made higher scores on critical thinking tests than those with lower <b>mental</b> <b>ability,</b> but the amount of increase in test scores at the higher <b>mental</b> <b>ability</b> level was approximately equal to the amount of increase in test scores at all lower <b>mental</b> <b>ability</b> levels. <b>Mental</b> <b>ability</b> was not directly related to change in critical thinking. 4. Evidence was obtained to indicate that there was no relationship between a student's <b>mental</b> <b>ability</b> and change in understanding science. 5. Change in dogmatism of students in the laboratory-centered patterns of instruction was significant for all levels of intelligence at the 0. 5 percent level. Students with high <b>mental</b> <b>ability</b> showed very little change in dogmatism. They scored low on the Dogmatism Scale when tested, thus they remained open-minded. The higher the <b>mental</b> <b>ability</b> of the student, the less dogmatic he was. Conversely, the lower the <b>mental</b> <b>ability</b> of the student the more dogmatic he was. The amount of change in dogmatism at each level of <b>mental</b> <b>ability</b> was approximately equal. The evidence to support the above statement pertains only to the laboratory-centered classes.
