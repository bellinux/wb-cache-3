500|$|Former KMFDM member Raymond Watts, {{last seen}} {{contributing}} vocals, programming, and production to 1988's Don't Blow Your Top before starting his own band, Pig, called Konietzko {{and asked if}} he would be interested in working on a small musical collaboration. [...] Konietzko agreed, and Watts flew to Seattle, where the pair, along with Schulz, worked on an EP entitled Sin Sex & Salvation. [...] Konietzko said of the trio's working together, [...] "It was the breath of fresh air I had been hoping and waiting for. [...] This short project took <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>off</b> the problems with the KMFDM album and gave me a welcome change of perspective." [...] Watts then stayed on with the group to begin work on Nihil, which featured a core group of Konietzko, Schulz, Watts, and Esch, along with some input from steel guitar specialist Durante and drummer Bill Rieflin.|$|E
2500|$|Duce {{considered}} [...] "Could Be Worse" [...] and [...] "I Would" [...] to be {{reminiscent of}} their second album, World Record (2011), {{in the sense}} that they feature [...] "the best bits of our band, and then a couple of new things." [...] According to Duce, the intro to [...] "Money" [...] was influenced by the music featured in the TV series Stranger Things. Referring to [...] "I Don't Want to Be Here Anymore", Duce said [...] "depressing, sad songs ... just come out. It's like therapy... something to take <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>off</b> things." [...] According to Duce, the song had been written three years prior. With [...] "A Night to Forget", Duce explained that the group were playing festivals where people would be [...] "pissed with their mates, jumping up and down and having a laugh – and it didn't feel like we had a song for that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] he replied, despondently. [...] "Awhile back I got <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>off</b> the game. Then--people who don't like me {{have taken}} {{advantage}} of my slump to----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Fox grinned, but {{he never}} said a word, and I made up <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> right <b>off</b> quick that there wouldn't be any need {{for me to tell}} Mr. Crow to take my name off the club list, for in two or three minutes more there wouldn't be enough left of me to talk about." ...|$|R
5000|$|Time, [...] "The Grand Race" [...] (book review) (November 5, 1965) — Stout {{once said}} {{all that he}} thinks is {{important}} to say. A good mystery writer, he wrote, merely tells the reader: [...] "Let's run a race. Here goes <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> I'm <b>off,</b> {{see if you can}} catch me." [...] In Doorbell, even FBI fans will have to admire his agility.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Stephen.' resumed Knight, 'now {{that matters}} are smooth between us, I think I must leave you. You won't <b>mind</b> <b>my</b> hurrying <b>off</b> to my quarters?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, in the morning. And it's {{now about}} half-past nine at night. You would bring that pie up, wouldn't you? Just when I {{was trying to}} keep <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>off</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The letter, when I read it, set <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>off</b> {{in a new}} direction. It surprised, it puzzled, it {{interested}} me. I thought, {{and thought}}, and thought of him, {{all the rest of}} the day.|$|E
60|$|Car near there now. Talk. Talk. Pat! Doesn't. Settling those napkins. Lot {{of ground}} he must {{cover in the}} day. Paint face behind on him then he'd be two. Wish they'd sing more. Keep <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll spare you the particulars; but in {{less than}} a month Arthur and I were engaged. He preached at a little one-night stand of a Methodist church. There was to be a parsonage the size of a lunch-wagon, and hens and honeysuckles when we were married. Arthur used to preach to me a good deal about Heaven, but he never could get <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> quite <b>off</b> those honeysuckles and hens.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Sir Halbert, [...] "be {{it as it}} will, my {{lady has}} acted hastily, for this was no great matter of offence to discard the lad whom she had trained up for years; but he, I doubt not, made it worse by his prating--it jumps well with a purpose, however, which I had in <b>my</b> <b>mind.</b> Draw <b>off</b> these people, Woodcock,--and you, Roland Graeme, attend me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am in {{the jewelry}} line now, {{representing}} {{one of the biggest}} houses in the United States. I was going through to Cleveland, but I made up <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> to stop <b>off</b> here and see you. I heard from one of the old boys that you were here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then please {{yield to}} such impulses {{as often as}} you feel them," [...] she begged. [...] "I adore flowers. Just now, too," [...] she added, with a little sigh, [...] "anything is welcome which helps to keep <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>off</b> my own affairs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] replied Jane, impatiently. [...] "Lassiter, {{why do you}} {{say that}} so often? I know you've teased me at times, and I believe it's only kindness. You're always trying to keep <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>off</b> worry. But you mean more by this {{repeated}} mention of my racers?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can {{issue no}} {{positive}} guarantee. Perhaps if I can keep <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>off</b> it ... I have had good {{results for the}} last ten minutes by thinking steadily of the Sahara. There," [...] said Eustace Hignett with enthusiasm, [...] "is a place for you! That is something like a spot! Miles and miles of sand and not a drop of water anywhere!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{was five}} years a-courting my wife,' he {{presently}} remarked. 'But folks were slower about everything in them days. Well, since she's coming we must make her welcome. Did any of ye catch by my reading which day it is he means? What with making out the penmanship, <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> was drawn <b>off</b> from the sense here and there.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And if he, or {{the folks}} {{he is gone}} to, call that the Christian religion, 'tis more than I do!" [...] rejoined the old woman. [...] "I wish I had met him, I'd have given him a bit of <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> about going <b>off</b> to his revenge, as he calls it, without ever a thought {{what was to become}} of his own flesh and blood here." ...|$|R
60|$|I noticed, I remember, as he paused, {{looking at}} me with his {{handsome}} head a little thrown back, and his glass raised in his hand, that, though the freshness of the sea-wind was on his face, and it was ruddy, there were traces in it, made since I last saw it, as if he had applied himself to some habitual strain of the fervent energy which, when roused, was so passionately roused within him. I had it in my thoughts to remonstrate with him upon his desperate way of pursuing any fancy that he took--such as this buffeting of rough seas, and braving of hard weather, for example--when <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> glanced <b>off</b> to the immediate subject of our conversation again, and pursued that instead.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, I'll {{tell you}} something," [...] he said. [...] "My {{mother told me}} once that when I was born my old dad took it just like you. Found he was getting all worked up by having to hang around and do nothing, so he says to himself: 'I've got to take <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>off</b> this business, or it's me for the foolish-house.' ...|$|E
60|$|LUBIN. I do {{not think}} I need to be {{reminded}} of that. In peace time I used to keep myself fresh for my work by banishing all worldly considerations from my mind on Sundays; but war has no respect for the Sabbath; and there have been Sundays within the last few years on which I have had to play as many as sixty-six games of bridge to keep <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>off</b> the news from the front.|$|E
60|$|Then began a slow, persistent, hard {{battle between}} me and the fish, the {{severity}} of which I did not realize at the time. In hours like those time has wings. My hands grew hot. They itched, and I wanted to remove the wet gloves. But I did not, and sought to keep <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>off</b> what had been half-healed blisters. Neither the fish nor I made any new moves, it all being plug on his part and give and take on mine. Slowly and doggedly he worked out toward the sea, and while the hours passed, just as persistently he circled back.|$|E
6000|$|... "Since then, Holham, I {{have been}} {{encouraged}} to keep <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> as much <b>off</b> the war and public affairs as possible, and I have been glad to do so. I knew the worst {{and there was no}} particular use in deepening my despondency by dragging out the details. But now I am more or less a live man again, and I want to fill in the gaps in my knowledge of what happened. You know how much I know, and how little; those fragments of Russian newspapers were about all the information that I had. I don't even know clearly how the whole thing started." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have other}} things to do, young man," [...] said he, [...] "than go a-hunting after bears. I'm just about making up <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> to send <b>off</b> a party to search out the valley {{on the other side}} of the Blue Mountains yonder, and bring back word if there are beaver there, for if not, I mean to strike away direct south. Now, if you've a mind to go with them, you're welcome. I'll warrant you'll find enough in the way of bear-hunting to satisfy you; perhaps a little Indian hunting to boot, for if the Banattees get hold of your horses, you'll have a long hunt before you find them again. Will you go?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{surfaces}} of artificial life [...] And manners finely wrought, the delicate race [...] Of colours, lurking, gleaming {{up and down}} [...] Through that state arras woven with silk and gold; [...] 565 [...] This wily interchange of snaky hues, [...] Willingly or unwillingly revealed, [...] I neither knew nor cared for; and as such [...] Were wanting here, I took what might be found [...] Of less elaborate fabric. At this day [...] 570 [...] I smile, in many a mountain solitude [...] Conjuring up scenes as obsolete in freaks [...] Of character, in points of wit as broad, [...] As aught by wooden images performed [...] For entertainment of the gaping crowd [...] 575 [...] At wake or fair.

6000|$|... "The {{green was}} a level piece of turf close to school, beside a stream, which, at that place, was formed {{into a deep}} pool {{by means of a}} mill-dam. We had named the pool the black hole. It was the scene of all our school fights. In class that day I was unusually quiet, for I could not help {{thinking}} of the impending fight. I felt {{that it would be a}} hard one, though I never for a moment doubted the result. To keep <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>off</b> the subject I applied myself to my lessons, and acquitted myself in a way that gratified the master and amazed the boys.|$|E
60|$|I had {{to leave}} off {{abruptly}} at the last page because Aristides had {{come in with a}} piece of news that took <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>off</b> everything else. I am afraid {{you are not going to}} get this letter even at the late date I had set for its reaching you, my dear. It seems that there has been a sort of mutiny among the crew of our trader, which was to sail next week, and now there is no telling when she will sail. Ever since she came the men have been allowed their liberty, as they call it, by watches, but the last watch came ashore this week before another watch had returned to the ship, and now not one of the sailors will go back. They had been exploring the country by turns, at their leisure, it seems, and their excuse is that they like Altruria better than America, which they say they wish never to see again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, what in {{the name}} of common sense," [...] ejaculated Captain Asher, [...] "did I think of that for? What has he to do with Olive, or Olive with him?" [...] And then he said to himself, {{thinking}} of the young man in the bosom of his family and without reference to anybody outside of it: [...] "Yes, his father must be pretty well off. He did a good deal more trading than ever I did. But after all, I don't believe he invested his money any better than I did mine, and it is just as like as not if we were to show our hands, that Olive would get as much as Dick's son. There it is again. I can't keep <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>off</b> the thing." [...] And as he spoke he knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and began to stride up and down the garden walk; and as he did so he began to reproach himself.|$|E
60|$|Ralph Bingham and Arthur Jukes (said the Oldest Member) {{had never}} been friends--their rivalry was too keen to admit of that--but it was not till Amanda Trivett came to stay here that a {{smouldering}} distaste for each other burst out into the flames of actual enmity. It is ever so. One of the poets, whose name I cannot recall, has a passage, which I am unable at the moment to remember, {{in one of his}} works, which for the time being has slipped <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> which hits <b>off</b> admirably this age-old situation. The gist of his remarks is that lovely woman rarely fails to start something. In the weeks that followed her arrival, being {{in the same room with}} the two men was like dropping in on a reunion of Capulets and Montagues.|$|R
6000|$|... "The steamer {{has come}} to anchor," [...] said our dirty Polish host to us in execrable English. [...] "And we may be off on board," [...] said Smith. [...] "Not yet," [...] he said; [...] "they must put their cargo out first." [...] I saw, however, that Smith was uneasy, and I made up <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> to go <b>off</b> to the vessel at once. When they should see an English {{portmanteau}} making an offer to come up the gangway, the Austrian sailors would not stop it. So I called for the bill, and ordered that the things should be taken down to the wretched broken heap of rotten timber which they called a quay. Smith had not told me his story, but no doubt he would {{as soon as he}} was on board.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{just like}} an artist; he takes a lump of white marble {{on the verge of}} a lime-kiln, he chips it about, he makes--he makes a {{monument}} to himself--and others--a monument the world will not willingly let die. Talking of mustard, sir, I was at Clapham Junction the other day, and all the banks are overgrown with horse radish that's got loose from a garden somewhere. You know what horseradish is--grows like wildfire--spreads--spreads. I stood at the end of the platform looking at the stuff and thinking about it. 'Like fame,' I thought, 'rank and wild where it isn't wanted. Why don't the really good things in life grow like horseradish?' I thought. <b>My</b> <b>mind</b> went <b>off</b> in a peculiar way it does from that to the idea that mustard costs a penny a tin--I bought some the other day for a ham I had. It came into my head that it would be ripping good business to use horseradish to adulterate mustard. I had a sort of idea that I could plunge into business on that, get rich and come back to my own proper monumental art again. And then I said, 'But why adulterate? I don't like the idea of adulteration.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Through {{that long}} night I held <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>off</b> the Morlocks {{as well as}} I could, and whiled away the time by trying to fancy I could find signs of the old constellations in the new confusion. The sky kept very clear, except for a hazy cloud or so. No doubt I dozed at times. Then, as my vigil wore on, came a faintness in the eastward sky, like the {{reflection}} of some colourless fire, and the old moon rose, thin and peaked and white. And close behind, and overtaking it, and overflowing it, the dawn came, pale at first, and then growing pink and warm. No Morlocks had approached us. Indeed, I had seen none upon the hill that night. And in the confidence of renewed day it almost {{seemed to me that}} my fear had been unreasonable. I stood up and found my foot with the loose heel swollen at the ankle and painful under the heel; so I sat down again, took off my shoes, and flung them away.|$|E
60|$|The {{fact is that}} we had {{absolutely}} incompatible dispositions and habits of thought and action, and our danger and isolation only accentuated the incompatibility. At Halliford I had already come to hate the curate's trick of helpless exclamation, his stupid rigidity of mind. His endless muttering monologue vitiated every effort I made to think out a line of action, and drove me at times, thus pent up and intensified, almost to the verge of craziness. He was as lacking in restraint as a silly woman. He would weep for hours together, and I verily believe that to the very end this spoiled child of life thought his weak tears in some way efficacious. And I would sit in the darkness unable to keep <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>off</b> him by reason of his importunities. He ate more than I did, and it was in vain I pointed out that our only chance of life was to stop in the house until the Martians had done with their pit, that in that long patience a time might presently come when we should need food. He ate and drank impulsively in heavy meals at long intervals. He slept little.|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt--no doubt--it {{is just as}} you say; and I hope these {{unexpected}} riches {{will leave}} us all as devout servants of God, as I humbly trust they found us. The property, however, is not mine, but Lucy's; I need not have any reserve with you, though Rupert has hinted it might be prudent {{not to let the}} precise state of the case be known, since it might bring a swarm of interested fortune-hunters about the dear girl, and has proposed that we rather favour the notion the estate is to be divided among us. This I cannot do directly, you will perceive, as it would be deception; but one may be silent. With you, however, it is a different matter, and so I tell you the truth at once. I am made executor, and act, of course; and this makes me the more glad to see you, for I find so much business with pounds, shillings and pence draws <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>off</b> from the duties of my holy office, and that I am in danger of becoming selfish and mercenary. A selfish priest, Miles, is as odious a thing as a mercenary woman!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Norfolk is {{the home}} county of Deaf Havana {{and many of the}} songs on Fools and Worthless Liars focus on the members childhoods' in the area. [...] "Hunstanton Pier" [...] is about the town of Hunstanton, where James Veck-Gilodi and bassist Lee Wilson went to school. 'It brings me back to the only place I ever really felt at home, and how much I miss it. It's hard for me to sing {{sometimes}} because it leads <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> to wander <b>off</b> and think about all the people I used to be so close to and what they are doing now'. [...] "Youth In Retrospect" [...] also deals with nostalgia and is again particularly personal to Veck-Gilodi and Lee Wilson. James has revealed that he is 'constantly battling with the fact that I'm constantly growing older' and how the pair 'wish we could go back to the days where... our biggest worry was whether our maths homework would be in on time'. [...] "Times Change, Friends Leave and Life Doesn't Stop For Anybody" [...] is about former member Ryan Mellor, with whom James has been friends since they were 14. 'This song is just, I suppose, about how much we miss him'.|$|R
60|$|I walked {{about the}} chamber {{most of the}} time. I {{imagined}} myself only to be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my reflections were concluded, and I looked up {{and found that the}} afternoon was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me, namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process; that <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> had put <b>off</b> all it had borrowed of Miss Temple--or rather that she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her vicinity--and that now I was left in my natural element, and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions. It did not seem as if a prop were withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone: it was not the power to be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tranquillity was no more. My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide, and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse, to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mayhap {{there were}} none at hand who knew, or wished to meddle with the law," [...] he said. [...] "Well, things were beyond all bearing at home, and you were going away, and would {{not so much as}} look at me. Now, one of the few sports my father did not look askance at was fishing, and he would endure my being out at night with, as he thought, poor man, old Pete Perring, who was as stern a Puritan as himself; but I had livelier friends, and more adventurous. They had {{connections}} with French free-traders for brandy and silks, and when they found I was one with them, my French tongue was a boon to them, till I came to have a good many friends among the Norman fishermen, and to know the snug hiding-places about the coast. So at last I made up <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> to be <b>off</b> with them, and make my way to my uncle in Muscovy. I had raised money enough at play and on the jewels one picks up in an envoy's service, and there was one good angel whom I meant to take with me if I could secure her and bind her wings. Now you know with what hopes I saw you gathering flowers alone that morning." ...|$|R
