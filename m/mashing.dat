25|$|Western black teas {{are usually}} brewed {{for about four}} minutes and are usually not allowed to steep for less than 30 seconds or more than about five minutes (a process known as brewing or <b>mashing</b> in Britain). In many regions of the world, however, {{actively}} boiling water is used and the tea is often stewed. In India, black tea is often boiled for fifteen minutes or longer to make Masala chai, as a strong brew is preferred. Tea should be strained while serving.|$|E
25|$|Dextrins can be {{produced}} from starch using enzymes like amylases, as during digestion {{in the human body}} and during malting and <b>mashing,</b> or by applying dry heat under acidic conditions (pyrolysis or roasting). The latter process is used industrially, and also occurs on the surface of bread during the baking process, contributing to flavor, color and crispness. Dextrins produced by heat are also known as pyrodextrins. The starch hydrolyses during roasting under acidic conditions, and short-chained starch parts partially rebranch with α-(1,6) bonds to the degraded starch molecule. See also Maillard Reaction.|$|E
25|$|To {{preserve}} the pretannin tea without requiring {{it all to}} be poured into cups, a second teapot may be used. The steeping pot is best unglazed earthenware; Yixing pots are {{the best known of}} these, famed for the high-quality clay from which they are made. The serving pot is generally porcelain, which retains the heat better. Larger teapots are a post-19th century invention, as tea before this time was very rare and very expensive. Experienced tea-drinkers often insist the tea should not be stirred around while it is steeping (sometimes called winding or <b>mashing</b> in the UK). This, they say, will do little to strengthen the tea, but is likely to bring the tannins out {{in the same way that}} brewing too long will do. For the same reason, one should not squeeze the last drops out of a teabag; if stronger tea is desired, more tea leaves should be used.|$|E

During boiling, water in the wort evaporates, but the sugars and other components of the wort remain; this allows more efficient use of the starch sources in the beer.

40|$|<b>MASH</b> 1 and <b>MASH</b> 2, {{mammalian}} homologues of the Drosophila neural determination genes achaete-scute, {{are members}} of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors. We show here that murine P 19 embryonal carcinoma cells {{can be used as a}} model system to study the regulation and function of these genes. <b>MASH</b> 1 and <b>MASH</b> 2 display complementary patterns of expression during the retinoic-acid-induced neuronal differentiation of P 19 cells. <b>MASH</b> 1 mRNA is undetectable in undifferentiated P 19 cells but is induced to high levels by retinoic acid coincident with neuronal differentiation. In contrast, <b>MASH</b> 2 mRNA is expressed in undifferentiated P 19 cells and is repressed by retinoic acid treatment. These complementary expression patterns suggest distinct functions for <b>MASH</b> 1 and <b>MASH</b> 2 in development, despite their sequence homology. In retinoic-acid-treated P 19 cells, <b>MASH</b> 1 protein expression precedes and then overlaps expression of neuronal markers. However, <b>MASH</b> 1 is expressed by a smaller proportion of cells than expresses such markers. <b>MASH</b> 1 immunoreactivity is not detected in differentiated cells displaying a neuronal morphology, suggesting that its expression is transient. These features of <b>MASH</b> 1 expression are similar to those observed in vivo, and suggest that P 19 cells represent a good model system in which to study the regulation of this gene. Forced expression of <b>MASH</b> 1 was achieved in undifferentiated P 19 cells by transfection of a cDNA expression construct. The transfected cells expressing exogenous <b>MASH</b> 1 protein contained E-box-binding activity that could be super-shifted by an anti-MASH 1 antibody, but exhibited no detectable phenotypic changes. Thus, unlike myogenic bHLH genes, such as MyoD, which are sufficient to induce muscle differentiation, expression of <b>MASH</b> 1 appears insufficient to promote neurogenesis...|$|R

500|$|The first step, {{where the}} wort is {{prepared}} by mixing the starch source (normally malted barley) with hot water, {{is known as}} [...] "mashing". Hot water (known as [...] "liquor" [...] in brewing terms) is mixed with crushed malt or malts (known as [...] "grist") in a mash tun. The <b>mashing</b> process takes around 1 to 2 hours, during which the starches are converted to sugars, and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains. The grains are now washed in {{a process known as}} [...] "sparging". This washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible. The process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and sparge water is called wort separation. The traditional process for wort separation is lautering, in which the grain bed itself serves as the filter medium. Some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist.|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the flavor}} {{characteristics}} of Grodziskie {{result from the}} chemical makeup of the water that the breweries used to produce the beer.

[...] Alkalinity (as calcium bicarbonate) was 350 ppm and the magnesium ion concentration was 34 ppm. [...] Using this type of water to produce beer would result in a higher than expected hop flavor because of the high alkalinity and the ratio of sulfate ions to chloride ions. [...] During the early stages of production, this water would have a higher pH, which would inhibit the efficiency of the natural enzymes that convert the starch in the grain to fermentable sugars during <b>mashing.</b> [...] The result is a beer with more unfermented sugars and lower average alcohol content. [...] Finally, the water would have contributed a slightly sour or bitter flavor to the beer, due to the high concentration of magnesium ions.|$|E
