25|$|At {{the heart}} of yield {{management}} decision-making process is the trade-off of marginal yields from segments that are competing for the same inventory.

The tradeoff is sometimes mistakenly identified as occurring at the intersection of the <b>marginal</b> <b>revenue</b> curves for the competing segments. While this is accurate when it supports marketing decisions where access to both segments is equivalent, it is wrong for inventory control decisions. In these cases the intersection of the <b>marginal</b> <b>revenue</b> curve of the higher valued segment with the actual value of the lower segment is the point of interest.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate that optimal greenhouse design must account for (and be combined to) optimal climate management. We prove this by showing that different strategies and set-points to control the greenhouse ventilators result in different ¿optimal sets¿ of design parameters. We determined these optimal sets for a passive greenhouse in Almería, Spain where tomatoes were grown. The greenhouse design parameters investigated in this research were: 1) the transmission of the cover for photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), 2) the transmission of near infrared (NIR) radiation and 3) the emission coefficient for longwave radiation of the cover. Six optimal sets of design parameters were determined by maximising the <b>marginal</b> <b>revenues</b> (crop yield minus costs of design parameters), under given climate conditions, and for different ventilation control strategies. Each ventilation control strategy had different set-points for the air temperature and carbon dioxide concen¬tration to control the greenhouse ventilators. To solve this optimization problem we used a dynamic crop-greenhouse model and an optimization algorithm. The model described the combined influence of the relevant design parameters, outdoor climate and ventilation control upon economic crop yield, through their effect on indoor climate. The yearly costs of the design parameters were empirically derived from prices, physical properties and lifespan of a number of greenhouse cover materials. Results showed that indeed for different strategies and set-points to control the green¬house ventilators different ¿optimal sets¿ of design parameters and <b>marginal</b> <b>revenues</b> were obtained. For example, the difference between the highest optimal NIR trans¬mission 1. 00 and the lowest optimal NIR transmission 0. 40 was 60 %, while the highest <b>marginal</b> <b>revenues</b> 16. 94 ¿m- 2 differed 18, 7 % with the lowest <b>marginal</b> <b>revenues</b> of 13. 77 ¿ m- 2. Additionally, it was found that the cover design parameters were time dependent. In conclusion, only a combined optimal control and design approach that takes into account the best climate control strategy and the time dependency of the design parameters will ensure optimal design parameters and maximum <b>marginal</b> <b>revenues...</b>|$|R

25|$|Yield {{management}} is of especially high relevance {{in cases where}} the constant costs are relatively high compared to the variable costs. The less variable cost there is, the more the additional revenue earned will contribute to the overall profit. This is because it focuses on maximizing expected <b>marginal</b> <b>revenue</b> for a given operation and planning horizon. It optimizes resource utilization by ensuring inventory availability to customers with the highest expected net revenue contribution and extracting the greatest level of ‘willingness to pay’ from the entire customer base. Yield management practitioners typically claim 3% to 7% incremental revenue gains. In many industries this can equate to over 100% increase in profits.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two sources}} of {{inefficiency}} in the MC market structure. First, at its optimum output the firm charges {{a price that}} exceeds marginal costs, The MC firm maximizes profits where <b>marginal</b> <b>revenue</b> = marginal cost. Since the MC firm's demand curve is downward sloping {{this means that the}} firm will be charging a price that exceeds marginal costs. The monopoly power possessed by a MC firm means that at its profit maximizing level of production there will be a net loss of consumer (and producer) surplus. The second source of inefficiency is the fact that MC firms operate with excess capacity. That is, the MC firm's profit maximizing output is less than the output associated with minimum average cost. Both a PC and MC firm will operate at a point where demand or price equals average cost. For a PC firm this equilibrium condition occurs where the perfectly elastic demand curve equals minimum average cost. A MC firm’s demand curve is not flat but is downward sloping. Thus in the long run the demand curve will be tangential to the long run average cost curve at a point to the left of its minimum. The result is excess capacity.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} anticipated inflation on the resource allocations between production and financial services. We develop a model with heterogeneous workers and two sectors economy. A manufacturing sector producing a final composite good and a financial sector providing monetary management services for manufacturers. Workers in this economy are heterogeneous in their productivity and are free to move between the two sectors. Hence workers with high productivity in the financial sector choose {{to work in the}} financial sector, where they can earn high wages, while workers with low productivity prefer to work in the manufacturing sector. In equilibrium, the allocation of workers between the two sectors, i. e., the size of each sector depends, among other factors, on the inflation rate. Higher inflation increases the <b>marginal</b> <b>revenues</b> of financial workers and decrease the <b>marginal</b> <b>revenues</b> of production workers. As a consequence, resources are shifted from the manufacturing sector to the financial sector. That is, the share of the financial services in output increases and production (output) decreases. The resulting decline in manufacturing sector output reduces consumption opportunities and represents costs of inflation. To estimate the change in the production structure and, thus, the costs of inflation we analyze data from 28 countries which had some notable inflation history during the period 1972 - 1995. We find strong support for the hypothesis that higher inflation increases the share of the financial sector output and employment relative to the manufacturing sector. anticipated inflation, resource allocation, financial sector. ...|$|R
