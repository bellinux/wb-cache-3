40|$|This paper {{tries to}} {{determine}} {{to what extent}} EU-US cooperation {{in the field of}} international peace and security is impacted by bilateral relations under the New Transatlantic Agenda versus <b>multilateral</b> <b>dialogues.</b> It employs Michael Smith's framework of 'bi-multilateral' negotiations in its analysis. The case studies explored are bilateral dialogues under the New Transatlantic Agenda alongside <b>multilateral</b> <b>dialogues</b> in the framework of the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and ad hoc fora such as the Middle East Quartet. The main finding is that bilateral and <b>multilateral</b> <b>dialogues</b> are complementary in EU-US cooperation on issues of international peace and security. Bilateral dialogues by themselves are not sufficient to effectively address complex international peace and security issues. <b>Multilateral</b> <b>dialogues</b> can gain useful support, efficiency and a degree of legitimacy from good relations at the bilateral level. Moreover, ad hoc fora can be valuable additions which may complement both existing bilateral as well as <b>multilateral</b> EU-US <b>dialogues.</b> Finally, the choice of forum and the potential of EU-US cooperation are often considerably influenced {{by the nature of the}} issue under discussion...|$|R

50|$|The {{methodology}} of DIVO {{comes from the}} combination of the creative application of technology with peer-led, participant-centred teaching techniques. Emphasis is placed on the process of generating media clips as well as the media clips themselves. In order to create a dialogue, groups need to digest what they have viewed and examine this against their existing knowledge before proceeding to generate more media and develop their response. DIVO is intended to operate as a <b>multilateral</b> <b>dialogue</b> between many groups and offer flexibility of access and timing.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} gives an outline on how {{bilateral}} and <b>multilateral</b> <b>dialogues</b> {{have used the}} notion of koinonia in relation to ecclesiology {{with a view to}} full visible Eucharistic fellowship.

The main purpose of this thesis is to see which were the starting points and the conclusions of the bilateral and <b>multilateral</b> <b>dialogues</b> in relation to koinonia and how close have churches come in the process of building consensus around the notion.

30|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} the media industry in Asia, with reference to international standards of media tools, instruments, content, and coverage. We have also explored factors that may further improve Asian media. We have used an empirical approach. Our findings revealed that the media in Asian significantly contribute to expanding cultural knowledge and the exchange of <b>multilateral</b> <b>dialogues.</b> However, they do not look after the interests of minorities or non-dominating communities. Although the media should be a virtual ambassador, they often provoke hostilities within regions. Governments own most media outlets in the developing nations in Asia, and so the media rely on government backing and are subject to restrictions. International and national regulations connected to media freedom or constraints should be explored to protect Asian societies. The practical implications of these negative aspects are that the Asian media does not help the plights of minorities or minimize the fear {{of war in the}} region. The universal lesson of brotherhood among humanity for all colors and races should be preached by the media. In this paper, we have concentrated on how Asian media influence cultural expansion, the exchange of <b>multilateral</b> <b>dialogues,</b> the interests of minorities, aggression between nations, and generate income for common citizens.|$|R

50|$|These {{experiences}} led Hollis {{to found}} the Agri-Energy Roundtable (AER), a <b>multilateral</b> <b>dialogue</b> forum convening food and energy-surplus country officials with business leaders in 1980. After AER‚Äôs first conference in New Orleans, {{a few weeks}} after the Carter Administration instituted the Soviet grain embargo, Hollis attracted the support of Dr. Armand Hammer, controversial chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Robert O. Anderson, chairman of Atlantic Richfield and Diamond A Cattle Company, and political patronage via the legendary U.S. Senator Jennings Randolph (D-WV), the ‚ÄúLast of the New Dealers‚Äù‚Äîand quickly propelled AER as a formidable international nongovernmental forum with annual conferences in Geneva, Switzerland. Senator Randolph became the de facto chairman and led the U.S. delegations to seven consecutive annual AER conferences (1981-1987) in Switzerland, often bringing other senators, senior government leaders, and U.S. industrialists‚Äîwhile Hollis gathered international representatives from his global contact network. The forum soon became recognized on the world stage and received United Nations accreditation as an NGO in 1985 by declaration of the UN secretary-general. This recognition came after a highly successful AER mission/conference series in People's Republic of China and PRC participation on the AER board.|$|E

Three main problems are considered in this paper: i) the criticism of the European Parliament for being inconsistent about the conditions under which countries can send delegates ii) the fact that the parliamentary meetings are too short and infrequent, and iii) the observation that the Eastern Partners focus too much on national and bilateral issues, thus failing to engage in <b>multilateral</b> <b>dialogue.</b> A number of recommendations are put forward to enhance the effectiveness of the Assembly...|$|E

Soon after the adoption of the HFA, a collective consensus emerged that strategies for DRR require a more integrated approach that engages all scientists, engineers, and policy planners, and that policy guidelines in the post-HFA period should better integrate with science and technology. Over the previous years, several science-policy negotiations and <b>multilateral</b> <b>dialogues</b> contributed to the post- 2015 framework for DRR, which identified the need to bring science and technology into the policy and planning mainstream for effective risk reduction.|$|R

30|$|We {{conclude}} that the media in Asia as a whole significantly contribute to cultural expansion and the exchange of <b>multilateral</b> <b>dialogues.</b> However, they do not look after the interests of minorities, {{although there have been}} minor improvements in relation to religious minorities. It {{should be noted that the}} media are virtual ambassadors who should always attempt to mitigate hostilities between nations, but it can been seen from our results that they can often provoke aggressions between territories. Asia has become an emerging economic source of power and this economic advancement will determine military modernization and any form of war intervention. The findings further reveal that, in Asian media the packaging factor production feature is the most practiced feature (see Table¬† 3).|$|R
