Many Oregon cities are developing park <b>master</b> <b>plans</b> to help manage their park systems. To best understand park <b>master</b> <b>plans</b> as a management tool, this paper asks the following questions: • Are there differences between city park systems with park <b>master</b> <b>plans</b> and city park systems without park <b>master</b> <b>plans?</b> • In what ways have park <b>master</b> <b>plans</b> been effective for Oregon communities? • Are there {{ways in which}} park <b>master</b> <b>plans</b> could be more effective? This paper evaluates the effectiveness of park <b>master</b> <b>plans</b> in Oregon communities by comparing survey responses from communities using a park <b>master</b> <b>plan</b> as a management tool to responses from communities without a park <b>master</b> <b>plan.</b> By analyzing this information, this paper makes recommendations about the types of communities best served by park <b>master</b> <b>plans</b> in Oregon...|$|R

Twenty existing <b>master</b> <b>plans</b> were analyzed to provide background information about typical content, format, and professionals involved with development of <b>master</b> <b>plans.</b> In addition, fifty surveys were conducted with Directors of botanical gardens and arboreta. Twenty questions were posed to the Directors to define the extent of <b>master</b> <b>plan</b> implementation (i. e. use) at the garden and to identify the factors that affect implementation. Log-likelihood ratio tests (G tests) were performed to evaluate the data. Eighty-eight percent of the institutions surveyed reported that they implement a <b>master</b> <b>plan</b> at the garden. Significant relationships were observed between use of the <b>master</b> <b>plan</b> and the following factors: hiring a landscape architecture firm; involvement of staff, Boards of Directors, and the community; and inclusion of key sections, graphics, and the institution's mission statement. Based on these results, guidelines for <b>master</b> <b>plan</b> development and implementation are presented...|$|R

25|$|In 1925 Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier, {{the head}} of urban {{planning}} in Paris moved to Havana for five years to collaborate with architects and landscape designers. In the <b>master</b> <b>planning</b> of the city his aim {{was to create a}} harmonic balance between the classical built form and the tropical landscape. He embraced and connected the city's road networks while accentuating prominent landmarks. His influence has left a huge mark on Havana although many of his ideas were cut short by the great depression in 1929. During {{the first decades of the}} 20th century Havana expanded more rapidly than at any time during its history. Great wealth prompted architectural styles to be influenced from abroad. The peak of Neoclassicism came with the construction of the Vedado district (begun in 1859). This whole neighborhood is littered with set back well-proportioned buildings.|$|E
500|$|Concurrent {{though with}} the {{planning}} of the new airport, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) initiated {{a study on the}} <b>master</b> <b>planning</b> and long-term development plans of four key domestic airports in the Philippines. The report cited Mandurriao Airport, Bacolod City Domestic Airport, Legazpi Airport and Daniel Z. Romualdez Airport in Tacloban City as these key domestic airports, noting the high growth of passenger and cargo volume there and the eventual need for expansion. [...] Heeding the recommendations of the JICA report, President Joseph Estrada signed a memorandum in November 1998 creating the Iloilo Airport Coordinating Committee, headed by Iloilo-born senator Franklin Drilon. [...] The coordinating committee decided that a new airport was needed for Iloilo City as Mandurriao Airport was deemed unexpandable due to operational obstacles and the presence of slums and other natural and civic structures that would restrict expansion efforts. [...] In addition, the committee, objecting to the idea that the new airport would serve merely as a reliever for the new Bacolod airport, successfully lobbied for an international airport to be built in lieu of a domestic one. [...] The project finally received NEDA approval in March 2000, with Cabatuan as the location of the new airport based on a study performed by both the DOTC and the JICA later that year.|$|E

500|$|In 1954, Cushing {{residents}} were [...] "perturbed" [...] {{by the possibility}} of a new language hall being built within the dormitory's sightlines, citing the concern that any artificial construction would ruin their views. Another controversy arose in April 1970 after students from Cushing objected to a plan put forth by a contingent of black students and approved by the Board of Trustees that would designate one wing of Cushing as a co-ed housing space for black students of all grades. Prior to the plan's formulation, upperclassmen black students could opt to live in a student community in Kendrick House while underclassmen could live in an analogous community in Main Building. Cushing {{residents were}} not notified of the plan until after its approval and a public meeting was held at which objections were raised by both Cushing residents and black students that one wing of the dorm might not be enough space to foster a black community and that Kendrick House should instead be repurposed as elective all-black housing. After the college's administration expressed the possibility that this plan might be in violation of U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare standards on segregation, all but four black students walked out of the meeting and the assembly decided that the Board of Trustees needed to be better informed of the racial climate on campus. In 1974, Vassar's <b>Master</b> <b>Planning</b> Committee voted to convert one of Cushing's common areas, then a dining room, to eight single dorms. An emergency meeting was held and students organized a Save Cushing Dining Room movement which collected 800 signatures against the plan in 24 hours. Other instances have seen one of Cushing's parlors converted to a quad dorm used to house students temporarily when no other housing could be found for them, first in 1989 then again during the first semester of the 199899 school year.|$|E
