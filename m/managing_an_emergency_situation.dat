40|$|Being able to {{reliable}} estimate the occupancy of areas inside a building can prove beneficial for <b>managing</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>situation,</b> as {{it allows for}} more efficient allocation of resources such as emergency personnel. In indoor environments, however, occupancy detection {{can be a very}} challenging task. A solution to this can be provided by the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons installed in the building. In this work we evaluate the performance of a BLE based occupancy detection system geared towards emergency situations that take place inside buildings. The system is composed of BLE beacons installed inside the building, a mobile application installed on occupants' mobile phones and a remote control server. Our approach does not require any processing to take place on the occupants' mobile phones, since the occupancy detection is based on a classifier installed on the remote server. Our real-world experiments indicated that the system can provide high classification accuracy for different numbers of installed beacons and occupant movement patterns...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Emergency care {{providers}} {{are required to}} demonstrate competency {{in the management of}} life-threatening situation. The care provider’s ability to <b>manage</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>situation</b> depends upon his/her knowledge and skills in basic CPR; and the use of emergency equipment and supplies. The education department at our healthcare facility is responsible for CPR/Emergency Management competency validation of over 2500 employees annually. Historically each employee was scheduled to attend 4 hours of class every year to review the content, complete the post-test and demonstrate skills. It was resource-intensive, time consuming, stressful and often difficult to schedule the 24 / 7 employees for the sessions. [See PDF for complete abstract...|$|R
50|$|Investigators {{noted the}} lack of {{preparedness}} {{on the part of}} the aircrew and the unsuitability of the rocky ground near the airfield for emergency landings.The lack of co-ordination between the pilots at the moment when tasks were transferred meant the Captain had to <b>manage</b> <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>situation,</b> which he had not had time to analyse completely. For the same reasons, he did not rely on the co-pilot, whom he simply asked on several occasions to let go (of the controls). He likely encountered some problems in taking over control, given that he repeated the terms “let go” and “take your hand off”, this continuing until the end of the recording. The co-pilot appears to have carried out the Captain’s orders by reading back in the affirmative and indicating her willingness to act (proposal to retract the gear, radio message to the tower with the hand mike) though without being sure of the role she was supposed to play. This may, for example, have resulted in her placing her hands on the control column at the time of the stall warning alarms, which would explain the repeated requests from the Captain. She was thus not fully carrying out her role as PNF and did not monitor or at least call out the speeds as they were decreasing. The co-pilot’s offer to retract the gear was probably not even noticed by the Captain, due to his sudden excess workload.|$|R
40|$|This study asks if a {{strategic}} {{approach to the}} management of communication can assist and support the overall operational commander in effectively <b>managing</b> <b>a</b> major <b>emergency</b> <b>situation.</b> Communication in this regard includes important strategictactical functions that need consideration when the community faces significant loss of life or damage, and incorporates tasks such as media management, public information, the raising of public awareness, internal communication, public affairs, community relations, and survivor and victim relations. Encompassing these functions {{are a number of}} overarching principles that, when adopted, allow the entire process to be approached from {{a strategic}} rather than a tactical viewpoint. The study demonstrates how an efficient, strategically focused communication team can assist the operational commander in <b>managing</b> <b>a</b> major <b>emergency</b> <b>situation.</b> The dissertation explores principles and practices for strategic communication management for major <b>emergencies.</b> It recommends <b>a</b> particular framework that is underpinned by six strategic communication principles. The framework was developed taking into account relevant theories and models of strategic communication and management, augmented by detailed primary and secondary qualitative deductive research. Research in this regard included reading not only the academic literature but also a broad range of official Irish and other documentation, including reports, manuals, guidance materials and legislation. Original primary research was undertaken to ascertain how a number of countries, regarded as leaders in this field, approach this subject and detailed interviews were conducted with responsible officials in Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. As relatively little data exists on the subject of major emergency strategic communication in the Irish context, in-depth interviews were also conducted with key individuals involved in major emergency management in Ireland. The study demonstrates that the strategic communication function is increasingly a critical success factor in major emergency management internationally. It also shows that, while major emergency communication initiatives have been undertaken in Ireland, the Irish approach is somewhat fragmented and tactical in nature...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — <b>Managing</b> <b>a</b> {{disaster}} and <b>emergency</b> <b>situation</b> is <b>a</b> challenging task. Various ICT based systems like the Oasis and SAHANA {{have been developed}} {{in the recent past}} to provide necessary coordination, collaboration, operational monitoring and resource sharing facilities for different phases of disaster management. As different organizations share their resources and skills in a disaster situation, the concepts related to collaborative networks (virtual enterprises/extended enterprises) become more relevant. Under such conditions, one of the issues is related to the efficient partner or team member selection as applicable in the case of collaborative networks. Although different partner selection mechanisms have been proposed in the literature of collaborative networks, these cannot be applied directly in the disaster management situation. Trust and reputation have been identified as one of the important factors for the efficient disaster management in the related literature. The current work focuses on the development of a reputation management system that can help in the evaluation of different team members for team formation and evaluating the performance of each member in terms of trust. The framework identifies important factors having impact on the reputation and trust of a particular organization working in collaboration with other organizations, proposes an algorithm for calculating the reputation score and finally proposes a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to extract information/indicators from information sources and external systems. The system can be applied in team formation and performance management system of various disaster management support tools...|$|R
