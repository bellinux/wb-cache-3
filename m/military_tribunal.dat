5|$|Alexander Socrates Onassis {{was born}} at the Harkness Pavilion, a private clinic in New York City's NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital. He was the elder child of the Greek {{shipping}} magnate Aristotle Onassis (1906–1975) and his first wife, Athina Livanos (1929–1974), herself a daughter of a Greek shipping magnate, Stavros G. Livanos. Onassis was named after his father's uncle, who was hanged by a Turkish <b>military</b> <b>tribunal</b> during their sacking of Smyrna in September 1922.

5|$|Thảo and Phát were {{stripped}} of their ranks, but nothing was initially done as far as prosecuting or sentencing them for their involvement in the coup for the time being. They went into hiding in Catholic villages and offered to surrender and support the government if they and their officers were granted amnesty. However, this failed to materialize, and in May 1965, a <b>military</b> <b>tribunal</b> loyal to Kỳ sentenced both to death in absentia.|$|E

5|$|Bormann {{returned}} with Hitler to the Führerbunker in Berlin on 16 January 1945 as the Red Army approached the city. After Hitler committed suicide, Bormann and others attempted to flee Berlin on 2 May to avoid capture by the Soviets. Bormann probably committed suicide on a bridge near Lehrter station. The body was buried nearby on 8 May 1945, {{but was not}} found and confirmed as Bormann's until 1972. Bormann was tried in absentia by the International <b>Military</b> <b>Tribunal</b> in the Nuremberg trials of 1945 and 1946.

5|$|Eight others {{implicated in}} Lincoln's {{assassination}} were tried by a <b>military</b> <b>tribunal</b> in Washington, D.C. and found guilty on June 30, 1865.

Samuel Mudd, Samuel Arnold, and Michael O'Laughlen {{were sentenced to}} life imprisonment at Fort Jefferson in Florida's Dry Tortugas. Edmund Spangler was given a six-year term in prison. O'Laughlen died in a yellow fever epidemic there in 1867. The others were eventually pardoned in February 1869 by President Andrew Johnson.|$|E
5|$|Japanese prisoner-of-war camps, many {{of which}} were used as labour camps, also had high death rates.

Many Spaniards lost their lives, and artist Francisco Goya, who witnessed the aftermath of the executions, painted his famous painting The Third of May 1808 to commemorate this event. The fighting and executions claimed at least 154 French and 409 Spanish lives and inspired resistance to the French across the country, signalling the start of the Spanish War of Independence. After Doaiz's death his wife entered a convent in Seville.|$|E
5|$|On January 23, 1824, de la Torre {{implemented}} anti-piracy {{measures in}} response to Spanish losses and political pressure from the United States, ordering that piracy be tried in a <b>military</b> <b>tribunal</b> with its defendants considered enemy combatants. De la Torre ordered the pursuit of pirates, bandits and those aiding them, issuing medals, certificates and bounties in gold and silver as rewards.

50|$|The use of <b>military</b> <b>tribunals</b> {{in cases}} of civilians was often controversial, as tribunals {{represented}} a form of justice alien to the common law, which governs criminal justice in the United States, and provides for trial by jury, the presumption of innocence, forbids secret evidence, and provides for public proceedings. Critics of the Civil War <b>military</b> <b>tribunals</b> charged that they had become a political weapon, for which the accused had no legal recourse to the regularly constituted courts, and no recourse whatsoever except through {{an appeal to the}} President. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed, and unanimously ruled that <b>military</b> <b>tribunals</b> used to try civilians in any jurisdiction where the civil courts were functioning were unconstitutional, with its decision in Ex parte Milligan (1866).|$|R
5|$|When {{presented}} {{with evidence of}} Benedict Arnold's activities, it is reported that Washington remained calm. He did, however, investigate its extent, and suggested {{that he was willing}} to exchange André for Arnold during negotiations with General Clinton over the fate of Major André. Clinton refused this suggestion; after a <b>military</b> <b>tribunal,</b> André was hanged at Tappan, New York on October 2. Washington also infiltrated men into New York in an attempt to capture Arnold. This plan very nearly succeeded, but failed when Arnold changed living quarters prior to sailing for Virginia in December.|$|E
5|$|Following Nazi Germany's collapse, the SS {{ceased to}} exist. Numerous {{members of the}} SS, many of them still {{committed}} Nazis, remained at large in Germany and across Europe. On 21 May 1945, the British captured Himmler, who was in disguise and using a false passport. At an internment camp near Lüneburg, he committed suicide by biting down on a cyanide capsule. Several other leading members of the SS fled, but some were quickly captured. Kaltenbrunner, chief of the RSHA and the highest-ranking surviving SS main department chief upon Himmler's suicide, was captured and arrested in the Bavarian Alps. He was among the 24 defendants put on trial at the International <b>Military</b> <b>Tribunal</b> in 1945–46.|$|E
5|$|Lafayette {{was held}} at Nivelles, then {{transferred}} to Luxembourg where a coalition <b>military</b> <b>tribunal</b> declared him, de Pusy, and two others to be prisoners of state for their roles in the Revolution. The tribunal ordered them held until a restored French king could render final judgment on them. On 12 September 1792, pursuant to the tribunal's order, the prisoners were transferred to Prussian custody. The party travelled to the Prussian fortress-city of Wesel, where the Frenchmen remained in verminous individual cells in the central citadel from 19 September to 22 December 1792. When victorious French revolutionary troops began to threaten the Rhineland, King Frederick WilliamII transferred the prisoners east to the citadel at Magdeburg, where they remained an entire year, from 4 January 1793 to 4 January 1794.|$|E

5|$|MacArthur was {{responsible}} for confirming and enforcing the sentences for war crimes handed down by the International <b>Military</b> <b>Tribunal</b> for the Far East. In late 1945, Allied military commissions in various cities of the Orient tried 5,700 Japanese, Taiwanese and Koreans for war crimes. About 4,300 were convicted, almost 1,000 sentenced to death, and hundreds given life imprisonment. The charges arose from incidents that included the Rape of Nanking, the Bataan Death March and Manila massacre. The trial in Manila of Yamashita was criticized because he was hanged for Iwabuchi's Manila massacre, which he had not ordered and {{of which he was}} probably unaware.

The first war crimes trial of 24 prominent {{figures such as}} Göring, Albert Speer, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Alfred Rosenberg, Hans Frank, and Kaltenbrunner took place beginning in November 1945. They were accused of four counts: conspiracy, waging a war of aggression, war crimes, and crimes against humanity in violation of international law. Twelve received the death penalty, including Kaltenbrunner, {{who was convicted of}} crimes against humanity and executed on 16 October 1946. The former commandant at Auschwitz, Rudolf Höss, who testified on behalf of Kaltenbrunner and others, was tried and executed in 1947.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S., Criminal Justice) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. Following the {{terrorist}} attacks on September 11, 2001, President George W. Bush responded by declaring a global war on terrorism (GWOT). As part of the GWOT, the United States launched two military invasions against Afghanistan and Iraq, which have inevitably led to the capture of terrorists. President George W. Bush selected to have these terrorists prosecuted in <b>military</b> <b>tribunals</b> rather than federal criminal courts. The selection of <b>military</b> <b>tribunals</b> has been controversial, and recently been denounced by newly elected President Barrack Obama. President Obama and his administration have publicly expressed the desire to end <b>military</b> <b>tribunals</b> and instead use federal criminal courts. 	 The {{purpose of this study is}} to use evaluative criteria that analyze the consequences for the transition from <b>military</b> <b>tribunals</b> to federal criminal courts for terrorist prosecution. Both judicial systems will be evaluated for pros and cons, and a recommendation will be made for which system the United States should use to prosecute GWOT prisoners. It is critical for the United States to select the most sensible solution for the prosecution of terrorists if it is to be successful in the GWOT. Criminal Justic...|$|R
