The fear of <b>missing</b> <b>something</b> {{often leads to}} extra blood tests and imaging scans for what may be harmless chest pains, run-of-the-mill head bumps, and non-threatening stomach aches, with a high cost on the Health Care system.|$|E
25|$|Five years later, Taki has {{graduated}} from university and {{is searching for}} a job. He senses he is <b>missing</b> <b>something</b> important, and learns that inhabitants of Itomori survived by following the mayor's order. He recognizes Tessie and Sayaka in a Tokyo restaurant, now engaged, but cannot identify them. One day, Taki and Mitsuha recognize each other when their trains draw parallel. They disembark and search for one another, finally meeting on a staircase. Feeling as though they have met before, they ask for each other's name.|$|E
25|$|Realising {{that she}} and K-9 are {{effectively}} on their own, she tries {{to figure out how}} to stop the sacrifice. Her first order of business is determining the when of it. Using Lavinia's books on witchcraft, she and K-9 deduce it must occur at midnight on the winter solstice, now just a few short hours away. The where of it is more elusive, however, causing the duo to drive around the shire looking at all the churches. As the last few minutes before midnight tick away, they finally realise that there's an abandoned chapel on Lavinia's property. Rushing home, K-9 and Sarah are briefly upset at <b>missing</b> <b>something</b> that was right under their noses all along.|$|E

25|$|The mystery {{begins to}} unravel. Alex and Chase decide that {{whatever}} the Tenandrome found, Lesha Tanner had found it first, 200 years before. Alex has an inspiration – {{the location of the}} <b>missing</b> <b>something</b> is obliquely described in a poem by Walford Candles, to whom Tanner must have confided the secret. A collection of Candles' poems, Rumors of Earth, had been in Uncle Gabe’s bedroom when Alex returned, and was open to that poem. Gabriel Benedict must have had the same insight. Alex is able to find the university researcher who helped his uncle work with the clues in Candles’ poem and who identifies a location about 1,300 light years into the Veiled Lady as the primary locus of search.|$|E
500|$|Bruce {{became the}} third {{president}} of the University of Houston in Houston, Texas on September 1, 1954, one month after retiring from military service. He succeeded interim president C. F. McElhinney. Shortly after arriving, Bruce noted that the university was <b>missing</b> <b>something</b> which he considered fundamental—a chapel for student use located on campus. He remarked to the Director of Religious Activities that if you [...] "xclude religion entirely from education...you have no foundation upon which to build moral character." ...|$|E
500|$|The musicians {{recorded}} ten takes, {{the last}} of which was selected for overdubbing. To create what Spector biographer Mark Ribowsky terms a [...] "four-man Wall of Sound" [...] production, Lennon added grand piano onto the basic track, while Harrison and White shared another piano and Voormann played electric piano. In addition, Beatles aide Mal Evans overdubbed chimes (or tubular bells) and White added a second, muffled drum part. With Lennon feeling that the chorus was <b>missing</b> <b>something,</b> Preston and Evans were sent {{to bring in a}} group of people from a nightclub to provide backing vocals. These newcomers and all the musicians, along with Allen Klein, then added chorus vocals, with Harrison directing the singing.|$|E

500|$|Lead singer Chris Martin wrote [...] "The Scientist" [...] after {{listening}} to George Harrison's [...] "All Things Must Pass". In an interview with Rolling Stone Magazine, Martin revealed that while working on the band's second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head, {{he knew that the}} album was <b>missing</b> <b>something.</b> One night, during a stay in Liverpool, Martin found an old piano that was out of tune. He wanted to work on Harrison's song, [...] "Isn't It a Pity", but he could not manage to do so. When the song came to Martin, he asked that the recorder be turned on. He concluded by saying that he came across this chord sequence and noted that the chord was [...] "lovely". Martin recorded the vocals and piano takes in a studio in Liverpool.|$|E
500|$|Ferraro told Sound On Sound {{that she}} did add a bass drum sample, as she felt that the kick was <b>missing</b> <b>something.</b> [...] "Rather than equalise it, I added {{a little bit of}} my sample to make the BD track sound bigger". However she did alter the two piano {{elements}} of the song, using the Flex Studio Tool to widen the sound of the piano element without the delay. Additionally, Ferraro used a number of French plug-in software to amplify many of the track's instruments, including the violin, strings and guitar samples. She then moved on to Rowland's vocals, which [...] "were extensively processed", including equalization and de-essing. Then upon completion of her work on the song, Ferraro sent [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] to her husband, Bruno Gruel, and his Elektra Mastering Suite which is located in the same building as the Super Sonic Scale Studio. Gruel received the song in a standard Pro Tools format, 24-bit/44.1kHz. He used several pieces of software to realign all of the elements of the song, particularly the bass drums and low synths.|$|E
500|$|Television Without Pity {{gave the}} episode an [...] "A". Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a glowing review, stating that [...] "I have to say, {{this is one}} of the most dense and {{interesting}} episodes of Veronica Mars yet, on a number of different levels." [...] He went on to praise the return of Troy, the various subplots, and the episode's ambiguous conclusion. The reviewer summed up by saying, [...] "With all that going on, it could have been easy for this episode to fall apart somewhere... "The Rapes of Graff" [...] really managed to do everything it was trying to do quite well. It may have been <b>missing</b> <b>something</b> special to put it in the absolute top tier of Veronica Mars episodes, but it's still a marvelous episode for pulling all those different strands together. Anais Bordages of BuzzFeed ranked the episode 27th of 64 episodes of Veronica Mars, but nevertheless gave a positive review, calling it [...] "awesome". She elaborated, [...] "The banter is excellent, our main character shoots down every sexist on campus, and Michael Cera has a cameo. Even better: The other part of the episode revolves around Cliff’s sexual misfortunes." [...] On a similar list, TV Line ranked the episode 16th.|$|E

500|$|The writer Michael Steinberg {{described}} the symphony's success as essentially {{a phenomenon of}} the compact disc, and while live performances are still given, they do not always sell out. Some critics, wondering at the sudden success of the piece nearly two decades after its composition, suggest that it resonated with a particular mood in the popular culture at the time. Stephen Johnson, writing in A guide to the symphony, wondered whether the commercial success of the work was [...] "a flash in the pan" [...] or {{would turn out to}} have lasting significance. In 1998, the critic Michael Steinberg asked, [...] " [...] really listening to this symphony? How many CD buyers discover that fifty-four minutes of very slow music with a little singing in a language they don't understand is more than they want? Is it being played as background music to Chardonnay and brie?" [...] Steinberg compared the success of Górecki's symphony to the Doctor Zhivago phenomenon of 1958: [...] "Everybody rushed to buy the book; few managed actually to read it. The appearance of the movie in 1965 rescued us all from the necessity." [...] Górecki was as surprised as anyone else at the recording's success, and later speculated that [...] "perhaps people find something they need in this piece of music…. Somehow I hit the right note, something they were <b>missing.</b> <b>Something,</b> somewhere had been lost to them. I feel that I instinctively knew what they needed." ...|$|E
500|$|To create {{tracks on}} Let the Blind Lead, Cox {{continually}} adds elements to a song until he [...] "feel like it's getting crowded…When it sounds done, it's done. And {{if it seems}} like it's <b>missing</b> <b>something,</b> I'll go back and add something." [...] Most of his music {{is the product of}} several hours' work, rather than that of a few days. [...] To Pitchfork Media Cox said that, with each song, [...] "The genesis is usually a beat." [...] Cox considers the music of Let the Blind Lead to have a [...] "dynamic arc": {{the first half of the}} record contains [...] "more accessible songs. I was very depressed in the middle, and it created this kind of black hole of misery. Then I tried to bring it up again at the end." [...] Cox intended for his music to be [...] "therapeutic", for both himself and his audience. [...] In addition, he wanted the album to have a healing element, and be something [...] "somebody could listen to all the way through and feel like they went through a bad period of time and came out of it." [...] Pauline Oliveros, a composer who runs an organization that studies music therapy, was described by Cox as having [...] "a big influence" [...] on him and his ideas of therapeutic music. [...] He considers music [...] "the only art form I know of that has such an immediate effect on the human psyche", and found the time he first met and talked with Oliveros as being [...] "like meeting a hero of mine." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} negative {{reviews from}} critics. A writer from Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "Teso Dos Bichos" [...] a C, and sardonically wrote, [...] "No es bueno!" [...] Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C− and criticized the laziness of the writing, saying, [...] "Maybe I'm <b>missing</b> <b>something</b> here. There {{could be some}} subtext in, um, yeah, I got nothing. The dead rats in the toilet were freaky, right? And they did kill that dog off, so that's hardcore. Really, though, I'm just too disappointed to say much else. This is paint-by-numbers at its most tedious, and while it's nice to have evident proof of how far the show has come since it started, that doesn't {{make it any easier}} to sit through." [...] Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode a scathing review, only awarding it 1/10. He criticized the seriousness of the plot and wrote, [...] "Overall, this has {{to be one of the}} worst episodes of the series. In nearly every possible way, the episode fails to live up to the usual expectations. Perhaps aware of how silly the whole thing sounds, the cast and crew seem weary of it all from beginning to end. Even some of the bad ideas in the later seasons don’t fall to this level of inadequacy." [...] Cyriaque Lamar from i09 called the Jaguar Spirit one of [...] "The 10 Most Ridiculous X-Files Monsters" [...] and wrote, [...] "In this fairly ridiculous Season 3 episode, an Ecuadorian artifact possessed by a Jaguar Spirit (or something) causes tabbies to go bonkers and murder people. This scene of Scully fighting a cat deserves the GIF treatment. Make it happen, folks!" [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one stars out of five, calling the premise [...] "achingly unambitious". The two roundly criticized the plot, calling it a [...] "retread of a cursed mummy movie without a mummy", as well as the performances of Trevino, Duchovny, and Anderson. Despite the overall negativity, Shearman and Pearson noted that the [...] "much derided" [...] cat sequence was not [...] "that badly handled." ...|$|E

2500|$|At Junimea, Pogor was {{a picturesque}} figure. Ornea {{suggests}} that, despite being a respectable boyar {{and the oldest}} among the founders, Pogor was also the most [...] "child-like" [...] in his reactions. Witnesses recall that he was always amused by the literary works presented for analysis, laughing [...] "till his new teeth jumped out of his mouth", and casually reclining on a sofa as the debates were taking place. Negruzzi recalled that, in defiance for [...] "any social habit", Pogor left his guests unattended to read his books; he writes that, on first impression, Pogor appeared [...] "cheeky and <b>missing</b> <b>something</b> upstairs". Moreover, Pogor embarrassed his friends with his obscene anecdotes, his name-calling, and his occasional outbursts, during which he would hurl his cape at them.|$|E
2500|$|Ebert, {{despite his}} praise, stated, [...] "I won't {{go so far}} as to {{describe}} it as a character study" [...] but that the film is more than the sum of its parts – parts that may at first seem a little generic or clichéd, since many other films (such as Very Bad Things) have already explored the idea of a weekend in Vegas gone wrong. The film's premise has several similarities to Dude, Where's My Car? Both films are about [...] "a couple guys waking up after a night of getting trashed, only to find they are <b>missing</b> <b>something</b> important", whose adventures include [...] "a trail of clues, a missing car, dubious encounters with strippers and wild animals, a brush with the law and gangs chasing them for something they don't realize they have".|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{back-door}} pilot, Zuiker {{stated that}} he believed the series [...] "needed a little more balance {{in terms of a}} leading woman". Executives offered Sela Ward the part of Megan Donner, a Lieutenant and Horatio's former boss. Ward turned down the role, and producers later cast Kim Delaney. Ann Donahue described Delaney's casting as [...] "a no-brainer," [...] stating that [...] "when Kim became available, we knew in a heartbeat that we wanted her." [...] Zuiker elaborated, noting that [...] "Kim brings a level of maturity, a level of balance with David Caruso [...] We just felt we were <b>missing</b> <b>something</b> in the whole picture – we needed a strong female in the cast." [...] The New York Times reported that original lead Emily Procter would [...] "now follow Ms. Delaney in the credits." ...|$|E
