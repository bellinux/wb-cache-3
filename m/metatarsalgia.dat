40|$|Background: The {{significance}} and measurement of first meta tarsal hypermobility {{has been difficult}} to quantify in rela tion to transfer <b>metatarsalgia.</b> We evaluated the hypothesis that dynamic elevation of the first metatarsal relative to the second metatarsal could be measured with a simple device and would be associated with transfer <b>metatarsalgia.</b> We also assessed intraobserver and interobserver reliability of the simple device. Materials and Methods: A series of 352 patients were prospectively measured for dynamic metatarsal elevation: 64 patients with transfer <b>metatarsalgia</b> and 288 patients without symptoms. Results: Those with <b>metatarsalgia</b> symptoms had significantly greater first ray mobility (9 mm versus 7 mm; p < 0. 0002) and metatarsal elevation (5 mm versus 3 mm; p < 0. 0002) than patients without symptoms. Conclusion: In this prospective series, the device was reliable for measuring dynamic first metatarsal elevation at different time points with different examiners.

40|$|AbstractTransfer <b>metatarsalgia</b> (TM) is {{a common}} {{forefoot}} disorder secondary to hallux valgus (HV). Some authors suggest that a combined lesser metatarsal osteotomy while undergoing HV surgery improves <b>metatarsalgia,</b> whereas others concluded that isolated HV corrective osteotomy can improve symptomatic <b>metatarsalgia.</b> The main purpose of this retrospective study was to compare clinical outcomes in patients with and without combined lesser metatarsal osteotomy while receiving HV correction surgery. We retrospectively reviewed the patients who underwent osteotomy for HV correction between January 2000 and December 2010. All patients underwent HV correction with modified Mitchell osteotomy. Clinical evaluations including the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score and residual <b>metatarsalgia</b> were assessed, and radiographic measurements were carried out. Sixty-five patients (83 feet) meeting the selection criteria were enrolled. Thirty feet receiving a combined lesser metatarsal osteotomy were classified as the combined surgery (CS) group, {{and the others were}} classified as the control (CN) group (53 feet). The overall rate of persistent symptomatic <b>metatarsalgia</b> was 19. 28 % after operative treatment. There were six feet with residual <b>metatarsalgia</b> in the CS group, and 10 feet in the CN group.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The use of {{metatarsal}} osteotomies in {{the treatment}} of <b>metatarsalgia</b> is controversial, as is the best location of the osteotomies to prevent transfer <b>metatarsalgia.</b> To determine if metatarsal osteotomies used in forefoot reconstruction to restore the normal anatomical curve would decrease the risk of transfer <b>metatarsalgia,</b> the clinical outcomes of such osteotomies were correlated with the preoperative planning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2000 and 2005, 63 patients (73 feet) with persistent <b>metatarsalgia</b> had forefoot reconstructions that included one or more Weil osteotomies designed to restore the theoretically ideal foot morphotype described by Maestro et al. and based on the relative lengths of the lesser rays. RESULTS: The mean preoperative American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score of 36. 2 improved to 82. 2 postoperatively. Sixty-two (85 %) of the 73 feet were pain-free after surgery. CONCLUSION: In spite of careful preoperative planning, it was difficult to obtain the ideal foot type, and the frequency of transfer <b>metatarsalgia</b> in our patients was similar to that reported in the literature. A significant (p = 0. 03) relationship was identified between the amount of preoperative instability and the risk of developing transfer <b>metatarsalgia.</b> Preoperative dorsoplantar standing radiographs, although helpful in planning surgery to obtain appropriate metatarsal lengths, should not be the only method used for operative planning...|$|E

Methods: Patients between 18 and 80 years, affected by <b>metatarsalgia</b> and treated by percutaneous oblique osteotomies, were included in this study. All patients were assessed radiographically and clinically with internationally validated scales: SF- 36, AOFAS, 17 -FFI, MOXFQ and VAS. Both outcomes were evaluated in relation to the restoration of the Maestro formula. Statistical analysis was performed and its significance was set at p < 0. 05. Results: A total of 91 patients (mean age 51. 6 years, M:F = 13 : 78) with a mean follow-up of 3. 9 years (range 2 to 7 years) were evaluated. MIS bone osteotomies were completely healed at a mean time of 3. 3 months.

METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted on 56 patients by means of radiographs on their 112 ft, of which 56 were in the <b>metatarsalgia</b> group and 56 in the control group. The evaluations were done between December 2012 and June 2013. The measurements were made by three third-year orthopedics residents with prior training in the methods used, and a template was used. RESULTS: There was no concordance between the two methods, as shown by Bland-Altman plots, although the intraclass correlation coefficients showed that the intra and interobserver reproducibility was high using the transverse line method (0. 78 and 0. 85) and moderate using the arc method (0. 73 and 0. 60).

40|$|SummaryIntroductionA Weil {{osteotomy}} {{with internal}} fixation {{can match the}} preoperative plan by precisely setting the metatarsal length; however 10 to 30 % of patients end up experiencing postoperative stiffness. A percutaneous distal metatarsal mini-invasive osteotomy (DMMO) is a purely extra-articular technique; metatarsal length is set automatically upon weight bearing of the foot. The goal {{of this study was}} to compare these two osteotomy techniques when performed on the three or four most lateral metatarsals. HypothesisA DMMO will result in better joint motion than a Weil osteotomy. Patients and methodsThis was a retrospective, single center, single surgeon study with 72 patients. Group 1 consisted of 39 patients operated by the DMMO technique. Group 2 consisted of 33 patients operated by the standard Weil osteotomy technique. In some cases, a procedure on the first ray (Scarf or fusion) was also performed. The age, gender and procedures on the first ray were comparable for both groups. Patients were evaluated with clinical (AOFAS score) and radiological outcomes (Maestro criteria) at 3 and 12 months minimum follow-up. ResultsSixty-seven patients were seen again with an average follow-up of 14. 8 months (range 12 – 24). The postoperative AOFAS score was comparable in both groups (86. 5 and 85. 3, respectively). The joint range of motion was comparable in both groups. Static problems (oedema, <b>metatarsalgia,</b> hyperkeratosis and dislocation) were comparable at the last follow-up. The <b>metatarsalgia</b> recurred in four patients from group 1 and five patients from group 2. After 3 months, oedema and <b>metatarsalgia</b> were significantly greater in group 1. Radiological measurements (M 1 P 1 angle, M 1 M 2 angle and Maestro criteria) were comparable. Metatarsal head recoil was identical between each ray in group 1. At the last follow-up, all the osteotomy sites had achieved union. Discussion and conclusionThe results of static <b>metatarsalgia</b> treatment were comparable when using a DMMO or Weil osteotomy. However the DMMO had longer postoperative recovery, notably because of oedema. The percutaneous DMMO technique did not improve joint range of motion.

ResultadosNão houve concordância em nenhum dos dois métodos verificados pelos gráficos de Bland‐Altman, apesar de o coeficiente de correlação intraclasses apresentar uma alta reprodutibilidade intra e interobservadores pelo MLT (0, 78 e 0, 85) e moderada pelo MA (0, 73 e 0, 60). Na comparação entre os grupos, observou‐se diferença estatística (p ≤ 0, 05) com um encurtamento do primeiro metatarso (3, 39 mm) maior no GC em relação ao GM (2, 14 mm). Nos pacientes com MP, a FM tipo index minus foi mais prevalente pelo MLT (62, 5 %) e o tipo {{zero plus}} pelo MA (71, 4 %). ConclusãoFoi observado que a prevalência da FM depende do método de mensuração. Em ambos os grupos houve predomínio do encurtamento do primeiro metatarso. Não houve concordância intra e interobservadores em nenhum dos métodos propostos. AbstractObjectivesThe aims {{of this study}} were (i) to ascertain the prevalence of different types of metatarsal formula among patients with primary metatarsalgia; (ii) to compare the variable of “shortening of the first metatarsal in relation to the second” (I/II) between the <b>metatarsalgia</b> and control groups; and (iii) to analyze the intra and interobserver concordance by means of Morton's transverse line method and Hardy and Clapham's arc method. MethodsA cross‐sectional observational study was conducted on 56 patients by means of radiographs on their 112 feet, of which 56 were in the <b>metatarsalgia</b> group and 56 in the control group. The evaluations were done between December 2012 and June 2013. The measurements were made by three third‐year orthopedics residents with prior training in the methods used, and a template was used. ResultsThere was no concordance between the two methods, as shown by Bland‐Altman plots, although the intraclass correlation coefficients showed that the intra and interobserver reproducibility was high using the transverse line method (0. 78 and 0. 85) and moderate using the arc method (0. 73 and 0. 60). Comparison between the groups showed that there was a statistical difference (p ≤ 0. 05) such that there was greater shortening of the first metatarsal (3. 39 mm) in the control group than in the <b>metatarsalgia</b> group (2. 14 mm). In the patients with primary <b>metatarsalgia,</b> the index minus metatarsal formula was more prevalent according to the transverse line method (62. 5 %) and the zero plus type according to the arc method (71. 4 %). ConclusionIn the present study, it was observed that the metatarsal formula prevalences depended on the measurement method. In both groups, shortening of the first metatarsal predominated. There was no intra or interobserver concordance in either of the two proposed method...|$|E
