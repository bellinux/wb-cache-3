5|$|Among the {{supporting}} roles, {{one of the}} highest-profile pieces of casting was Malcolm <b>McDowell</b> as Soho porn baron Benny Barrett. Barrett appears in scenes across various episodes from 1966 through to 1979, but the production could only afford him for three weeks. This was because <b>McDowell</b> was then a resident in the United States. All of McDowell's scenes were therefore shot by Stuart Urban {{as part of the}} first block of filming, as opposed {{to the rest of the}} production which was filmed roughly chronologically. This was considered more than worthwhile, however, for the prestige of being able to use an actor such as <b>McDowell,</b> predominantly a film actor who rarely did television work.|$|E

As Jeffries was running out the play, <b>McDowell</b> said something to him prompting Jeffries to charge the mound and wrestle <b>McDowell</b> to the ground.

On December 28, {{accompanied}} by 100 Pima scouts, Captain William Brown led 120 of Crook's men to a siege of the cave. 110 Kwevkepaya were trapped in the cave, when Brown ordered the soldiers to fire at {{the roof of the}} cave, causing rock fragments and lead shrapnel to rain down on the Guwevkabaya. Having nowhere else to go, the besieged gathered around the mouth of the cave, where soldiers (accompanied by Crook) pushed boulders onto them from above, killing 76 of the group.
