6000|$|... "I {{may decide}} to marry him," [...] <b>Maggie</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "One gets rather tired here of the regular St. George's, Hanover Square, business, and all that comes afterwards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] <b>Maggie</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "that {{if that is}} so, the place for us is where those two people are. What is the {{importance}} of Kroten, Mr. Jesson?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{he goes to}} Paris," [...] <b>Maggie</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Naida and Immelan will go. So shall we. If {{he comes}} here, it will be easier. Tell me, Nigel, {{did you see the}} Prime Minister?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{you have}} proved {{yourself}} {{equal to the}} occasion," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Maggie,</b> [...] "and <b>said</b> what it was incumbent on you to say under the circumstances." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If it was {{any other}} female but yourself, <b>Maggie,</b> as <b>said</b> that, I'd scorn to notice you," [...] {{returned}} Billy, half indignant.|$|R
50|$|Rickman also murdered Dr. Stephen Jensen, {{the husband}} of Maggie Beckett, when Jensen learned that Rickman was {{responsible}} for the coma victims. Rickman lied to <b>Maggie</b> and <b>said</b> a mob had killed him.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{sounds very}} picturesque," [...] <b>Maggie</b> <b>said</b> coldly, [...] "but I {{do not follow}} your allegory. What I {{want to know is}} why you lied to me, why you sent me to that house to meet Prince Shan?" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Maggie</b> <b>said</b> {{this and}} left it, but {{the tone of}} it had the next moment {{determined}} in her friend a fresh reaction. [...] "You think, both of you, so abysmally and yet so quietly. But it's what will have saved you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, mother, {{what is the}} matter?" [...] <b>Maggie</b> <b>said,</b> {{with pale}} lips, as her mother came toward her crying. She didn't think her father was ill, because the letter had come at his {{dictation}} from the office at St. Ogg's.|$|E
5000|$|The {{film was}} criticized for its lack of {{cinematic}} technique, artistic and chemistry between its leads. On Variety, <b>Maggie</b> Lee <b>said</b> the film [...] "feels like a puzzle with half the pieces missing." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>MAGGIE.</b> But you <b>said</b> {{yourself}} that his second thoughts were sometimes such an improvement on the first.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, thank you," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Maggie,</b> {{blushing}} with returning self-consciousness at this direct address, {{and taking}} up her work again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Safely {{as regards}} being thrown with him perhaps after all, {{in such a}} case, too long. He's a person to think you might easily feel {{yourself}} to be. So it won't," [...] <b>Maggie</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "come from father. He's too modest." ...|$|E
6000|$|Anna {{was so much}} {{in earnest}} that her words, {{straight}} out of a very innocent and contrite heart, touched her hearers deeply, {{and put them into}} the right mood to embrace her proposition. No one spoke for a moment, then <b>Maggie</b> <b>said</b> quietly,-- ...|$|E
60|$|They {{talked of}} love and marriage, and the {{position}} of woman in marriage. <b>Maggie</b> <b>said</b> that love was the flower of life, and blossomed unexpectedly and without law, and must be plucked where it was found, and enjoyed for the brief hour of its duration.|$|E
5000|$|When {{he retired}} from Field and Stream in 1993, the magazine’s {{managing}} editor, <b>Maggie</b> Nichols, <b>said,</b> “No one could possibly take Ed’s place.” [...] "Exit Laughing" [...] disappeared from the back page of the magazine. However, [...] "out of respect for sales", his old columns began to be reprinted.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, father, dear father," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Maggie,</b> an unspeakable anxiety predominating {{over her}} grief, [...] "you forgive him--you forgive every one now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it alive?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Maggie,</b> whose {{imagination}} {{had settled}} {{for the moment}} {{on the idea that}} Tom kept a ferret clandestinely.|$|R
6000|$|When {{their father}} came the second time, <b>Maggie</b> <b>said</b> to him, [...] "O father, Philip Wakem is so {{very good to}} Tom; {{he is such a}} clever boy, and I do love him.--And you love him too, Tom, don't you? Say you love him," [...] she added entreatingly.|$|E
60|$|<b>Maggie</b> <b>said</b> nothing, {{but turned}} away from her with a deep frown. She was {{actually}} beginning to think that she should like to make Lucy cry, by slapping or pinching her, especially as it might vex Tom, whom it was of no use to slap, even if she dared, because he didn't mind it. And if Lucy hadn't been there, Maggie was sure he would have made friends with her sooner.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we're {{going on}} beautifully," [...] he answered--though {{by no means}} with the effect {{it would have had}} if their mute transaction, that of {{attempted}} capture and achieved escape, had not taken place. As <b>Maggie</b> <b>said</b> nothing, none the less, to gainsay his remark, it was open to him to find himself the next moment conscious of still another idea. [...] "I wonder if it would do. I mean for me to break in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is Mr. Stephen Guest," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Maggie,</b> rather faintly. [...] "My cousin Lucy's--a {{gentleman who}} is very {{intimate}} at my cousin's." ...|$|R
2500|$|Ellen Barkin, who has {{the small}} role of the {{television}} reporter, <b>Maggie</b> Foley, later <b>said</b> that she [...] "hated" [...] making the film: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Maggie,</b> smiling, but {{not looking}} up; [...] "so much fluency and self-possession {{should not be}} wasted entirely on private occasions." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Maggie</b> <b>said</b> nothing, {{but turned}} away from her with a deeper frown. As long as Tom seemed to prefer Lucy to her, Lucy made part of his unkindness. Maggie would have thought a little while ago that she could never be cross with pretty little Lucy, any more than she could be cruel to a little white mouse; but then, Tom had always been quite {{indifferent}} to Lucy before, and it had been left to Maggie to pet and make much of her. As it was, she was actually beginning to think that she should like to make Lucy cry by slapping or pinching her, especially as it might vex Tom, whom it was of no use to slap, even if she dared, because he didn't mind it. And if Lucy hadn't been there, Maggie was sure he would have got friends with her sooner.|$|E
60|$|They are Wylie and Sons of {{the local}} granite quarry, in which Alick was {{throughout}} his working days a mason. It is David who has raised them to this position; he climbed up himself step by step (and hewed the steps), and drew the others up after him. 'Wylie Brothers,' Alick {{would have had the}} firm called, but David said No, and James said No, and <b>Maggie</b> <b>said</b> No; first honour must be to their father; and Alick now likes it on the whole, though he often sighs at having to shave every day; and on some snell mornings he still creeps from his couch at four and even at two (thinking that his mallet and chisel are calling him), and begins to pull on his trousers, until the grandeur of them reminds him that he can go to bed again. Sometimes he cries a little, because there is no more work for him to do for ever and ever; and then Maggie gives him a spade (without telling David) or David gives him the logs to saw (without telling Maggie).|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Tulliver {{sent for}} her sisters, {{and there was}} much wailing and lifting up of hands below stairs. Both uncles and aunts saw that the ruin of Bessy and her family was as {{complete}} as they had ever foreboded it, {{and there was a}} general family sense that a judgment had fallen on Mr. Tulliver, which it would be an impiety to counteract by too much kindness. But Maggie heard little of this, scarcely ever leaving her father's bedside, where she sat opposite him with her hand on his. Mrs. Tulliver wanted to have Tom fetched home, and seemed to be thinking more of her boy even than of her husband; but the aunts and uncles opposed this. Tom was better at school, since Mr. Turnbull said there was no immediate danger, he believed. But {{at the end of the}} second day, when Maggie had become more accustomed to her father's fits of insensibility, and to the expectation that he would revive from them, the thought of Tom had become urgent with her too; and when her mother sate crying at night and saying, [...] "My poor lad--it's nothing but right he should come home," [...] <b>Maggie</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Let me go for him, and tell him, mother; I'll go to-morrow morning if father doesn't know me and want me. It would be so hard for Tom to come home and not know anything about it beforehand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I shan't peep," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Maggie</b> disdainfully; and she {{buried her}} face in the pillow like a person of strict honour.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Tom, {{will the}} debts be paid soon?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Maggie,</b> {{clasping}} her hands, {{with a sudden}} flash of joy across her wretchedness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{laugh at}} me, Tom," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Maggie,</b> in a passionate tone, with an {{outburst}} of angry tears, stamping, and {{giving him a}} push.|$|R
6000|$|It now appeared, {{none the}} less, that some renewed {{conversation}} with Mr. Crichton had breathed on the faintness revivingly, and Maggie mentioned her purpose as {{a conception of}} her very own, {{to the success of}} which she designed to devote her morning. Visits of gracious ladies, under his protection, lighted up rosily, for this perhaps most flower-loving and honey-sipping member of the great Bloomsbury hive, its packed passages and cells; and though not sworn of the province toward which his friend had found herself, according to her appeal to him, yearning again, nothing was easier for him than to put her in relation with the presiding urbanities. So it had been settled, <b>Maggie</b> <b>said</b> to Mrs. Assingham, and she was to dispense with Amerigo's company. Fanny was to remember later on that she had at first taken this last fact for one of the finer notes of her young woman's detachment, imagined she must be going alone because of the shade of irony that, in these ambiguous days, her husband's personal presence might be felt to confer, practically, on any tribute to his transmitted significance. Then as, the next moment, she felt it clear that so much plotted freedom was virtually a refinement of reflection, an impulse to commemorate afresh whatever might still survive of pride and hope, her sense of ambiguity happily fell and she congratulated her companion on having anything so exquisite to do and on being so exquisitely in the humour to do it. After the occasion had come and gone she was confirmed in her optimism; she made out, in the evening, that the hour spent among the projected lights, the annals and illustrations, the parchments and portraits, the emblazoned volumes and the murmured commentary, had been for the Princess enlarging and inspiring. Maggie had said to her some days before, very sweetly but very firmly, [...] "Invite us to dine, please, for Friday, and have any one you like or you can--it doesn't in the least matter whom;" [...] and the pair in Cadogan Place had bent to this mandate with a docility not in the least ruffled by all that it took for granted.|$|E
6000|$|She had not again, for weeks, had Mrs. Assingham so effectually in {{presence}} {{as on the}} afternoon of that lady's return from the Easter party at Matcham; but the intermission was made up as soon as the date of the migration to Fawns--that of the more or less simultaneous adjournment of the two houses--began to be discussed. It had struck her, promptly, that this renewal, with an old friend, of the old terms she had talked of with her father, was the one opening, for her spirit, that wouldn't too much advertise or betray her. Even her father, who had always, as he would have said, [...] "believed in" [...] their ancient ally, wouldn't necessarily suspect her of invoking Fanny's aid toward any special inquiry--and least of all if Fanny would only act as Fanny so easily might. Maggie's measure of Fanny's ease would have been agitating to Mrs. Assingham had it been all at once revealed to her--as, for that matter, it was soon destined to become even on a comparatively graduated showing. Our young woman's idea, in particular, was that her safety, her escape from being herself suspected of suspicion, would proceed from this friend's power to cover, to protect and, as might be, even showily to represent her--represent, that is, her relation to the form of the life they were all actually leading. This would doubtless be, as people said, a large order; but that Mrs. Assingham existed, substantially, or could somehow be made prevailingly to exist, for her private benefit, was the finest flower Maggie had plucked from among the suggestions sown, like abundant seed, {{on the occasion of the}} entertainment offered in Portland Place to the Matcham company. Mrs. Assingham, that night, rebounding from dejection, had bristled with bravery and sympathy; she had then absolutely, she had perhaps recklessly, for herself, betrayed the deeper and darker consciousness--an impression it would now be late for her inconsistently to attempt to undo. It was with a wonderful air of giving out all these truths that the Princess at present approached her again; making doubtless at first a sufficient scruple of letting her know what in especial she asked of her, yet not a bit ashamed, as she in fact quite expressly declared, of Fanny's discerned foreboding of the strange uses she might perhaps have for her. Quite from the first, really, <b>Maggie</b> <b>said</b> extraordinary things to her, such as [...] "You can help me, you know, my dear, when nobody else can;" [...] such as [...] "I almost wish, upon my word, that you had something the matter with you, that you had lost your health, or your money, or your reputation (forgive me, love!) so that I might be with you as much as I want, or keep you with ME, without exciting comment, without exciting any other remark than that such kindnesses are 'like' me." [...] We have each our own way of making up for our unselfishness, and Maggie, who had no small self at all as against her husband or her father and only a weak and uncertain one as against her stepmother, would verily, at this crisis, have seen Mrs. Assingham's personal life or liberty sacrificed without a pang.|$|E
5000|$|Maggie and Wade {{never got}} along. When they first met, Wade said, [...] "There's {{something}} about that woman I don't like. Make that everything about that woman I don't like." [...] Maggie was critical of the way Wade was handling the death of Maximillian Arturo and used it as evidence that she was weak. However she started to understand as she also broke down due to her husband's death and reevaluated her opinion of Wade somewhat when Wade saved her life from a zombie commenting that Wade [...] "showed her something" [...] by doing that and seemed somewhat humbled by the experience. In the episode [...] "Dinoslide", the conflict between Wade and Maggie was further examined. At {{the beginning of the}} episode, Wade was upset about Maggie's desire to kill Rickman out of revenge. Later, when the sliders encountered dinosaurs, Maggie wanted to kill the Tyrannosaurus Rex. Wade remarked, [...] "Isn't there anything she doesn't think about killing?" [...] By the end of the episode, there were indicators that the two were starting to get along; Wade and <b>Maggie</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Nice shooting!" [...] to each other as they were shooting a gun at an oxygen tank in the dinosaur's mouth in an attempt to kill the dinosaur. The last time they saw each other was in the episode [...] "This Slide of Paradise". At the end of the episode, <b>Maggie</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I'm going to miss you getting on my nerves Wade!" [...] and then Wade responded by saying, [...] "Same here." [...] When Maggie met Marda in the episode [...] "Genesis", Marda said, [...] "Wade said you were a tough bitch," [...] and Maggie responded, [...] "Yeah, I bet she did!" [...] After the Sliders lost Wade (and apparently Rembrandt for good), Maggie broke down and said she couldn't take the loss anymore until as part of Wade's last act, she returned Rembrandt to the Sliders.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't care," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Maggie.</b> [...] "It's {{something}} about politics, of course. But it's {{no reason why}} you can't smile at me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Philip," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Maggie,</b> [...] "I {{wish you}} didn't feel so." [...] But her {{heart began to}} beat with {{something}} of Philip's discontent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, what {{a startling}} announcement!" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Maggie,</b> quite {{mistress}} of herself, though {{not without some}} inward flutter. [...] "I wonder where Lucy is." ...|$|R
