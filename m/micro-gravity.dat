5|$|Polyakov {{volunteered for}} his 437-day flight {{to learn how}} the human body would respond to the <b>micro-gravity</b> {{environment}} on long-duration missions to Mars. Upon returning from his second spaceflight, Polyakov held {{the record for the}} most total time in space. This record, however, was later broken by Sergei Avdeyev and is currently held by Gennady Padalka. Data from Polyakov's flight has been used by researchers to determine that humans are able to maintain a healthy mental state during long-duration spaceflight just as they would on Earth.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{completion}} of his shuttle mission, Cenker returned {{to work in the}} civilian aerospace field. Cenker's last two years with RCA Astro-Electronics and it's successor GE Astro Space were spent as Manager of Payload Accommodations on an EOS spacecraft program. After leaving GE, Cenker served as a consultant for various aerospace companies regarding <b>micro-gravity</b> research, and spacecraft design, assembly and flight operations. Cenker supported systems engineering and systems architecture studies for various spacecraft projects, including smallsats, military communications satellites, and large, assembled-in-orbit platforms. His contributions included launch vehicle evaluation and systems engineering support for Motorola on Iridium, and launch readiness for the Globalstar constellation. Other efforts include systems engineering and operations support for INTELSAT on Intelsat K and Intelsat VIII, for AT on Telstar 401 and 402, for Fairchild-Matra [...] on SPAS III, for Martin Marietta on Astra 1B, BS-3N, ACTS, and for the Lockheed Martin Series 7000 communications satellites.|$|E

50|$|To prevent some of {{the effects}} {{associated}} with weightlessness, a treadmill with vibration isolation and stabilization designed for the International Space Station (ISS) was first evaluated during STS-81. Three crew members ran and walked on the device, which floats freely in the <b>micro-gravity</b> experienced during orbit. For {{the majority of the}} more than 2 hours of locomotion studied, the treadmill operated well, and vibration transmitted to the vehicle was within the <b>micro-gravity</b> allocation limits that are defined for the ISS. Refinements to the treadmill and harness system, which ultimately led to development of the COLBERT model, were studied after this first flight. One goal of the treadmill design is to offer the possibility of generating 1 g-like loads on the lower extremities while preserving the <b>micro-gravity</b> environment of the ISS for structural safety and vibration free experimental conditions.|$|E

50|$|The {{firing of}} the ullage motors is used during stage {{separation}} of rocket and/or stabilization of a rocket {{when there are}} brief reductions in acceleration which could allow the liquid propellant to float away from the engine intakes.

50|$|Tendons {{are soft}} tissue {{structures}} that respond {{to changes in}} mechanical loading. Bulk mechanical properties, such as modulus, failure strain, and ultimate tensile strength, decrease {{over long periods of}} disuse as a result of micro-structural changes on the collagen fiber level. In <b>micro-gravity</b> simulations, human test subjects can experience gastrocnemius tendon strength loss of up to 58% over a 90-day period.|$|E
50|$|In June 2003, Koss {{created a}} {{controversy}} by authoring an Op Ed {{article in the}} New York Times claiming that scientists bore partial responsibility for the space shuttle Columbia disaster. He argued that most <b>micro-gravity</b> scientific experiments did not require manned space missions, but were used to sell the space program. The article drew widespread attention, and resulted in congressional hearings at which Koss appeared.|$|E
50|$|The {{satellites}} {{are able}} to translate in the <b>micro-gravity</b> environment with 6 degrees-of-freedom, using twelve cold-gas thrusters that use liquid CO2 as propellant. The liquid CO2 are stored in a small on-board container, {{similar to those that}} are used in paintball guns. The CO2 is converted to a gaseous state before being ejected through the thrusters for propulsion. Desired thrust is achieved through pulse modulation of thrust solenoids.|$|E
50|$|The {{implants}} {{have a major}} flaw in that extreme cold {{interferes with}} their functions and can disable them given sufficient exposure. However, when Austin returns to a warmer temperature, the implants quickly regain full functionality. The first season also established that Austin's bionics malfunction in the <b>micro-gravity</b> of space, though Austin's bionics are later modified to rectify this. The bionic eye is vulnerable to ultrasonic attack, resulting in blindness and dizziness.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, {{vibration}} {{training has}} been successfully applied in several Bedrest Studies of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the German Space Agency (DLR) where side-alternating vibration training was used to minimize {{the negative effects of}} simulated <b>micro-gravity</b> on muscle and bone loss. In addition the DLR successfully tested a Galileo Space vibration training device in several parabolic flight campaigns and showed that the application of vibration training is in fact feasible under zero gravity conditions.|$|E
