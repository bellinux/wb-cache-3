40|$|Proposed uses {{of small}} {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (UAVs), including home package delivery, {{have the potential}} to expose large portions of communities to a new noise source. This paper discusses results of flyover noise measurements of four small UAVs, including an internal combustion-powered model airplane and three battery-powered <b>multicopters.</b> Basic noise characteristics of these vehicles are discussed, including spectral properties and sound level metrics such as sound pressure level, effective perceived noise level, and sound exposure level. The size and aerodynamic characteristics of the <b>multicopters</b> in particular make their flight path susceptible to atmospheric disturbances such as wind gusts. These gusts, coupled with a flight control system that varies rotor speed to maintain vehicle stability, create an unsteady acoustic signature. The spectral variations resulting from this unsteadiness are explored, in both hover and flyover conditions for the <b>multicopters.</b> The time varying noise, which differs from the relatively steady noise generated by large transport aircraft, may complicate the prediction of human annoyance using conventional sound level metrics...|$|R

50|$|A {{multirotor}} or <b>multicopter</b> is a rotorcraft {{with more}} than two rotors. An advantage of multirotor aircraft is the simpler rotor mechanics required for flight control. Unlike single- and double-rotor helicopters which use complex variable pitch rotors whose pitch varies as the blade rotates for flight stability and control, multirotors often use fixed-pitch blades; control of vehicle motion is achieved by varying the relative speed of each rotor to change the thrust and torque produced by each.|$|E
50|$|<b>Multicopters,</b> {{especially}} quadcopters, have fast been gaining popularity as agile camera platforms {{capable of}} filming {{high quality video}} while hovering and maneuvering in tight spaces.

Like its smaller cousin the hexacopter, the landing gear of the octocopter consists of a pair of skids which can fold 90° upward to avoid obstruction to payload such as cameras, and the octocopter is mainly intended for agricultural, aerial cinematography, photography, and survey missions. Taihua octocopter made its public debut on December 6, 2014 when a group of Chinese governmental officials visited Taihua robotic and UAV production facility in Jizhou City.|$|E
50|$|Civil {{aviation}} authorities, {{and model}} aircraft association insurance rules, restrict operations of radio-controlled aircraft, including multicopter-carrying cameras, to {{line of sight}} (LOS) operation. For all practical purposes, the range of operation of a <b>multicopter,</b> carrying a camera, {{is limited to a}} few hundred meters from the operator who is holding the radio control unit. The operational range of the most common, electric-powered multicopters are well-below the operational altitude and range of commercial aircraft, which are capable of conventional aerial photography using a larger, professional cameras that are hand-held by a camera operator, or, mounted inside a gyro-stabilized platform, which are mounted {{on the outside of the}} aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|Helicopters were {{developed}} and built {{during the first}} half-century of flight, with the Focke-Wulf Fw 61 being the first operational helicopter in 1936. Some helicopters reached limited production, {{but it was not}} until 1942 that a helicopter designed by Igor Sikorsky reached full-scale production, with 131 aircraft built. [...] Though most earlier designs used more than one main rotor, it is the single main rotor with anti-torque tail rotor configuration that has become the most common helicopter configuration. Tandem rotor helicopters are also in widespread use due to their greater payload capacity. Coaxial helicopters, tiltrotor aircraft, and compound helicopters are all flying today. Quadcopter helicopters pioneered as early as 1907 in France, and other types of <b>multicopter</b> have been developed for specialized applications such as unmanned drones.|$|E
5000|$|Quadcopters {{and other}} <b>multicopters</b> often can fly autonomously. Many modern flight {{controllers}} use software {{that allows the}} user to mark [...] "way-points" [...] on a map, to which the quadcopter will fly and perform tasks, such as landing or gaining altitude. The PX4 autopilot system, an open-source software/hardware combination in development since 2009, has since been adopted by both hobbyists and drone manufacturing companies alike to give their quadcopter projects flight-control capabilities. Other flight applications include crowd control between several quadcopters where visual data from the device is used to predict where the crowd will move next and in turn direct the quadcopter to the next corresponding waypoint.|$|R
40|$|Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is the {{aircraft}} without a human pilot aboard.

They are widening their use in civil areas, for example, search and rescue operations, filmmaking, remote sensing of chemical leaks, crop spraying and monitoring in agriculture, etc. Most of the UAVs are either of airplane (fixed-wing) type or copter (Vertical Take Off and Landing) type. The aim of this project is to design the UAV that will combine the hovering abilities of <b>multicopters</b> with the endurance of fixed-wing aircrafts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — An {{important}} {{focus of}} current {{research in the}} field of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) is to increase the safety of their operation in general unstructured environments. An example of a real-world application is visual inspection of industry infrastructure, which can be greatly facilitated by autonomous <b>multicopters.</b> Currently, active research is pursued to improve real-time vision-based localization and navigation algorithms. In this context, the goal of Challenge 3 of the EuRoC 20144 Simulation Contest was a fair comparison of algorithms in a realistic setup which also respected the computational restric-tions onboard an MAV. The evaluation separated the problem of autonomous navigation into four tasks: visual-inertial local-ization, visual-inertial mapping, control and state estimation, and trajectory planning. This EuRoC challenge attracted the participation of 21 important European institutions. This pape...|$|R
