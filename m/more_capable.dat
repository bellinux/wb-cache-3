5|$|The destroyers are a {{follow-on}} of the Project 15 s, but {{are considerably}} <b>more</b> <b>capable</b> due to major {{improvements in the}} design, the addition of substantial land-attack capabilities, and the fitting-out of modern sensors and weapons systems.|$|E
5|$|The figures {{improved}} {{after the}} autumn 1941. More resources, better training and equipment including <b>more</b> <b>capable</b> strike aircraft resulted in increasing kill numbers. By 1942, increased numbers of better aircraft and armament enabled the offensive {{capabilities of the}} Command to increase dramatically.|$|E
5|$|The study {{undertaken}} by the Space Technology Laboratory suggested {{the use of a}} Thor-Hydra booster, however the <b>more</b> <b>capable</b> and more readily available Atlas-Agena B booster was selected instead.

Its success was a boon for NASA, as well as for the astronomers who now had a <b>more</b> <b>capable</b> space telescope.|$|E
5|$|The {{school was}} founded in 1885 as the Georgia School of Technology as part of Reconstruction plans to build an {{industrial}} economy in the post-Civil War Southern United States. Initially, it offered only a degree in mechanical engineering. By 1901, its curriculum had expanded to include electrical, civil, and chemical engineering. In 1948, the school {{changed its name to}} reflect its evolution from a trade school to a larger and <b>more</b> <b>capable</b> technical institute and research university.|$|E
5|$|Tropic Moon III {{involved}} {{a completely new}} set of systems, up to date, and infinitely <b>more</b> <b>capable</b> than those previously installed. An entire new aircraft sub-variant, the B-57G, was developed for the purpose with a redefined nose to house the new sensor package. Development of the aircraft experienced major delays during which it was equipped with a laser target designated {{to be used with}} the then new first-generation Pave Way laser-guided bombs.|$|E

5|$|A {{favourite}} of {{the ruling}} Ngô family, Đính received rapid promotions ahead of officers who were regarded as <b>more</b> <b>capable.</b> He converted to Roman Catholicism to curry favour with Diệm, and headed the military wing of the Cần Lao party, a secret Catholic organisation that maintained the Ngôs' grip on power. At the age of 32, Đính became the youngest ever ARVN general and {{the commander of the}} II Corps, but he was regarded as a dangerous, egotistical and impetuous figure with a weakness for alcohol and partying.|$|E
5|$|But the Cobra was a quickly made {{helicopter}} {{based on}} the UH-1 Iroquois, and in the late 1960s the U.S. Army was designing the Lockheed AH-56 Cheyenne, a much <b>more</b> <b>capable</b> attack aircraft with greater speed. These developments worried the U.S. Air Force, which saw the anti-tank helicopter overtaking its nuclear-armed tactical aircraft as the primary anti-armor force in Europe. A 1966 U.S. Air Force study of existing close air support (CAS) capabilities revealed gaps in the escort and fire suppression roles, which the Cheyenne could fill. The study concluded that the service should acquire a simple, inexpensive, dedicated CAS aircraft at least as capable as the A-1, and that it should develop doctrine, tactics, and procedures for such aircraft to accomplish the missions for which the attack helicopters were provided.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, however, Sinclair Radionics was {{experiencing}} serious difficulties. It lost {{its ability to}} compete effectively in the calculator market following the launch {{of a new generation}} of Japanese-produced calculators with liquid crystal displays, which were much <b>more</b> <b>capable</b> and power-efficient than Sinclair's LED calculators. Projects to develop a pocket television and digital watch turned out to be expensive failures. The company made losses of more than £350,000 in 1975–76, bringing it to the edge of bankruptcy. In July 1977 Radionics was rescued by a state agency, the National Enterprise Board (NEB), which recapitalised it, provided a loan facility and took effective control of the company by acquiring a 73% stake.|$|E

5|$|Diệm deposed head {{of state}} Bảo Đại in a {{fraudulent}} referendum in 1955 and proclaimed himself president of the newly created Republic of Vietnam (commonly known as South Vietnam). The VNA thus became the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). Born into a nominally Buddhist family, Đính had converted to Catholicism {{in the hope of}} advancing his career. The change of religion was widely perceived to be a factor in his rapid promotion above <b>more</b> <b>capable</b> officers. A devout member of the Catholic minority, Diệm dedicated the country to the Virgin Mary and heavily disenfranchised and disadvantaged the Buddhist majority.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II, {{however, the}} {{decision}} was made to establish a permanent standing defence force and the role of Reserve forces was reduced to the point where for a while their relevance was called into question. Recently, however, there has been a move to develop a <b>more</b> <b>capable</b> Reserve force, as Australia's overseas military commitments in the Pacific and Middle East have highlighted the importance of the Reserves once more. As such, since 2000 units of the Australian Army Reserve have been deployed to East Timor and the Solomon Islands on peacekeeping duties and many more individual Reservists have been used to provide specialist capabilities and to fill in Regular Army formations being sent overseas.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World War II, No.6 Squadron escorted convoys off the Australian east coast and undertook training exercises with the Australian Army and RAN. The squadron's Ansons were replaced by twelve Mark I Lockheed Hudson light bombers during April and May 1940. These aircraft were much <b>more</b> <b>capable</b> than the Ansons, having a longer range, higher speed and greater bomb load. No.6 Squadron continued to be based at Richmond, though detachments were made to other airstrips along the east coast when the squadron escorted troop convoys. In August 1940 the squadron conducted long range patrols searching for German raiders which {{were present in the}} Tasman Sea, but without success.|$|E

5|$|Grimm {{mounted a}} second {{expedition}} in June 1981 aboard the research vessel Gyre, with Spiess and Ryan again joining the expedition. To increase {{their chances of}} finding the wreck, the team employed a much <b>more</b> <b>capable</b> sonar device, the Scripps Deep Tow. The weather was again very poor, but all 14 of the targets were successfully covered and found to be natural features. On {{the last day of}} the expedition, an object that looked like a propeller was found. Grimm announced on his return to Boston that Titanic had been found, but the scientists declined to endorse his identification.|$|E
5|$|Pricing {{was central}} to the {{marketing}} strategy, {{as it had been}} through Sinclair's career. The ZX81 had been designed to meet a £70 price point and was launched at a price of £69.95 (built) or £49.95 (kit). One Sinclair brochure presented a side-by-side comparison of the ZX81 with the four machines that Sinclair considered its main rivals – the Acorn Atom, Apple II Plus, Commodore PET and TRS-80. The comparison highlighted the vast differences in cost, from £630 {{in the case of the}} Apple II Plus to just £70 for the ZX81, though even by Sinclair's own comparison the Apple was by far the <b>more</b> <b>capable</b> machine.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{returning}} to Brazil, PedroII was faced with an unexpected crisis. The Brazilian clergy had long been understaffed, undisciplined and poorly educated, leading to a great loss {{of respect for the}} Catholic Church. The imperial government had embarked upon a program of reform to address these deficiencies. As Catholicism was the state religion, the government exercised a great deal of control over Church affairs, paying clerical salaries, appointing parish priests, nominating bishops, ratifying papal bulls and overseeing seminaries. In pursuing reform, the government selected bishops who satisfied its criteria for education, support for reform and moral fitness. However, as <b>more</b> <b>capable</b> men began to fill the clerical ranks, resentment of government control over the Church increased.|$|E

5|$|The B-class {{boats were}} deemed {{redundant}} once <b>more</b> <b>capable</b> submarines arrived in early 1915 and most returned to Malta. B6 and B11, however, {{were sent to}} Alexandria where they conducted patrols along the Libyan coast to prevent arms deliveries to rebellious tribesmen. During one incident on 16 August 1915 a party of Arabs and officers in European uniforms were spotted displaying a flag of truce. The two submarines anchored and Lieutenant Holbrook was rowed ashore to talk to them. They opened fire, killing one man and wounding three, including Holbrook. The submarines were soon withdrawn from this task as they were totally unsuitable for this duty, lacking any deck armament at all.|$|E
5|$|The DDL design evolved {{during the}} late 1960s. As a result of {{planning}} conducted during 1967 and 1968, it gradually {{became clear that the}} ships would replace rather than complement the Navy's three s and four early s. Accordingly, it was specified in 1969 that the DDLs would be <b>more</b> <b>capable</b> and flexible than originally conceived, allowing the RAN to maintain its capabilities as the older destroyers retired. The intended roles for the DDLs' were set in 1970 by an agreement between the RAN and Department of Defence, which specified that the ships were to be capable of destroying equivalent surface warships, carrying out maritime interdiction duties, commanding groups of patrol boats and aircraft, have reasonable anti-aircraft and anti-submarine capabilities and be able to provide naval gunfire support to land forces.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{concentrated}} their riposte {{against the}} central column. Herff—who {{had been prepared}} to fall back—instead launched a local counter-attack toward Fort Capuzzo during the afternoon of 15 May with the 2nd Battalion Panzer Regiment5. At around 13:30, DCompany 1DLI at the landing ground was overrun, and with no anti-tank support <b>more</b> <b>capable</b> than the Boys anti-tank rifle, the remaining troops of 1DLI were forced to fall back toward Musaid. A fortuitous dust cloud aided their withdrawal, but by 14:45 Panzer Regiment5 was reporting that it had recaptured Capuzzo, inflicting heavy casualties on the British and taking 70 prisoners.|$|E
