40|$|Despite the {{explosive}} growth of electronic commerce and the rapidly increasing number of consumers who use interactive media for both pre-purchase information searches and online shopping, very {{little is known about}} the impact of <b>market</b> <b>concentration</b> on electronic <b>markets.</b> Classical economic theory describes four different types of markets: perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and monopoly. Each category demonstrates certain distinguishing characteristics with respect to pricing, technology, and customer service. A highly concentrated market tends to act monopolistically whereas an unconcentrated market leans toward perfect competition. This paper will study the impact of <b>market</b> <b>concentration</b> as quantified by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index on fourteen electronic markets.

Nonetheless, with imperfect information, in small-world networks the higher speed of diffusion produced by the low average distance increases this probability. A low social cohesion also increases the probability of falling into traps of under-adoption.

On the basis of empirical analysis, the article argues that neither the addi-tive nor the multiplicative model are fair reflections of reality.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the market structure of four different sectors within {{the construction industry}} in Hong Kong. <b>Market</b> <b>concentrations,</b> {{expressed in terms of}} Herfindahl-Hershamann indices (HHIs) and number equivalents (HNEs), are calibrated for the top five contractors and compared with those of the local property industry. The study reveals the following ascending order of market concentrations: private building, public building, property development, and civil engineering. Our explanation is that technological and capital requirements have imposed a strong barrier to entry into the civil engineering sector, resulting in a concentrated market. Conversely, the lack of technological demand and supply in the private building sector has led to easy market entry and exit. Building contractors thus compete intensely on cost reduction rather than technology improvement, leading to poor construction safety and product quality. The paper concludes that the Government, being a major client of construction works and regulator of the industry, can assume {{a more active role in}} promoting the overall competitiveness of indigenous local contractors in Hong Kong.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} increased competition from deregulation on {{the dynamics of the}} U. S. banking industry. We find the link between a bank’s relative performance and its subsequent market share growth strengthens significantly after deregulation as competitive reallocation effects transfer assets to better performers. The increase in the link is strongest in states that were initially more regulated and therefore likely to be less competitive, e. g., states with unit banking restrictions and high <b>market</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Exit dynamics also change in ways consistent with the disciplinary role of competition. After states deregulate, both the exit rates and the average profitability of exiting banks increase as more banks are exposed to the corporate takeover market. The net effect of these forces is a substantial reallocation of market share toward better banks. We conclude that earlier regulation of U. S. banks blunted this market mechanism and seriously hindered the competitive process. Stiroh is a Research Officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Strahan is an Associate Professor o...|$|E

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringAnil PahwaThis {{dissertation}} {{introduces a}} novel approach for optimally operating a day-ahead electricity market not only by economically dispatching the generation resources but also by minimizing the influences of market manipulation attempts by the individual generator-owning companies while ensuring that the power system constraints are not violated. Since economic operation of the market conflicts with the individual profit maximization tactics such as market manipulation by generator-owning companies, a methodology {{that is capable of}} simultaneously optimizing these two competing objectives has to be selected. Although numerous previous studies have been undertaken on the economic operation of day-ahead markets and other independent studies have been conducted on the mitigation of market power, the operation of a day-ahead electricity market considering these two conflicting objectives simultaneously has not been undertaken previously. These facts provided the incentive and the novelty for this study. 	 A literature survey revealed that many of the traditional solution algorithms convert multi-objective functions into either a single-objective function using weighting schemas or undertake optimization of one function at a time. Hence, these approaches do not truly optimize the multi-objectives concurrently. Due to these inherent deficiencies of the traditional algorithms, the use of alternative non-traditional solution algorithms for such problems has become popular and widely used. Of these, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) have received wide acceptance due to their solution quality and robustness. In the present research, three distinct algorithms were considered: a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II), a multi-objective tabu search algorithm (MOTS) and a hybrid of multi-objective tabu search and genetic algorithm (MOTS/GA). The accuracy and quality of the results from these algorithms for applications similar to the problem investigated here reinforced the selection of these algorithms. The results obtained from each of the three algorithms used in the evaluations are very comparable. Thus one could safely conclude that the results obtained are valid. Three distinct test power systems operating under different conditions were studied for evaluating the suitability of each of these algorithms. The test cases included scenarios in which the power system was unconstrained as well as constrained. Repeated simulations carried out for the same test case with varying starting points provided evidence that the algorithms and the solutions were robust. Influences of different <b>market</b> <b>concentrations</b> on the optimal economic dispatch are evidenced by the pareto-optimal-fronts obtained for each test case studied. Results obtained from a traditional linear programming (LP) based solution algorithm that is used at present by many market operators are also presented for comparison. Very high market-concentration-indices were found for each solution from the LP algorithm. This suggests the need to use a formal method for mitigating market concentration. Operating the market at industry-recommended threshold levels of market concentration for selecting an optimal operational point is presented for all test cases studied. Given that a solution-set instead of a single operating point is found from the multi-objective optimization methods, additional flexibility to select any operational point based on the preference of those operating the market clearly is an added benefit of using multi-objective optimization methods. However, in order to help the market operator, a more logical fuzzy decision criterion was tested for selecting a suitable operating point. The results show that the optimal operating point chosen using the fuzzy decision criterion provides a higher economic benefit to the market, although at a slightly increased market concentration. 	 	Since the main objective of this research was to simultaneously optimize the economic operation of a day-ahead market while ensuring minimal market power by individual generator owners, the proposed method is much improved from the current industry practice. The current practice of after-the-fact mitigation of market power has created various problems for both the market operator and the market participants, giving rise to a large numbers of disputes and resettlement activities. Hence, an approach that mitigates market power at the time of market dispatch as used in this research would bring about a more efficient market operation...|$|E

We aim to contribute to the debate by investigating both partial and combined effects of corporate governance and <b>market</b> <b>concentration</b> on innovation. Utilising a dataset for 1, 400 non-financial US-listed companies and two-way cluster-robust estimation methodology, we report several findings. First, the relationship between <b>market</b> <b>concentration</b> and innovation is non-linear. Secondly, the relationship has a U-shape in the case of input measure of innovation (research and development - R&D – expenditures); but it has an inverted-U shape when net book-value of brands and patents is used as output measure of innovation. Third, corporate governance indicators such as anti-takeover defences and insider control tend to have a negative partial effect on R&D expenditures but a positive partial effect on net book-value of brands and patents. Finally, when interacted with <b>market</b> <b>concentration,</b> anti-takeover defences and insider control act as complements to <b>market</b> <b>concentration.</b> Hence, firms with strong anti-take-over defences and under insider control tend to spend more on R&D but are less able to generate valuable brands and patents as <b>market</b> <b>concentration</b> increases. These results are based on two-way cluster-robust estimation, which takes account of both serial and cross-sectional dependence in the error terms. ...|$|R
