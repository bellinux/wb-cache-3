Richardson and Suinn defined {{mathematical}} anxiety as [...] "feelings of apprehension and tension concerning manipulation of numbers and completion of mathematical problems in various contexts". Richardson and Suinn introduced the MARS (<b>Mathematics</b> <b>Anxiety</b> Rating Scale) in 1972. Elevated {{scores on the}} MARS test translate to high math anxiety. The authors presented the normative data, including a mean score of 215.38 {{with a standard deviation}} of 65.29, collected from 397 students that replied to an advertisement for behavior therapy treatment for math anxiety. [...] For test-retest reliability, the Pearson product-moment coefficient was used and a score of 0.85 was calculated, which was favorable and comparable to scores found on other anxiety tests. Richardson and Suinn validated the construct of this test by sharing previous results from three other studies that were very similar to the results achieved in this study. They also administered the Differential Aptitude Test, a 10-minute math test including simple to complex problems.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{presents a}} handbook {{for high school}} and college counselors and teachers who work with students who have school anxiety. Chapter One defines school anxiety as a strong physical and psychological reaction to specific situations in school that seriously impairs the ability of the student to perform. General anxiety is described, along with the physiology and cognitive elements of anxiety. Chapter Two focuses on assessment of school anxiety, looking at types of assessment, sample clinical assessments, and standardized anxiety assessments. Chapter Three identifies study skills as the first cognitive therapy technique for controlling school anxiety. Four problem areas are identified and four critical skills are presented: time management, concentrating and remembering, managing test situations, and assertiveness and lack of responsibility. Chapter Four presents the technique of systematic desensitization, describing traditional desensitization, in vivo desensitization, and audio tape and group presentations. Chapter Five identifies cognitive approaches to treating school anxieties. This chapter focuses on skills acquisitions, cognitive restructuring, and the development of coping strategies. Chapter Six presents general stress management techniques, including diet and eating patterns, exercise, and managing time and life pacing. Major differences in the treatment strategies to be used for the various types of school anxieties (test, speech, and <b>mathematics</b> <b>anxieties)</b> are discussed in Chapter Seven.

40|$|Australian {{psychology}} {{programs are}} influenced by the scientist-professional model of psychological training described by the accreditation guidelines of the Australian Psychological Society. A common complaint from students is that this leads to teaching focussed on “rats and stats”, and it is possible that students who are not confident with respect to mathematics, computing and statistics may be less likely to progress through the degree. We {{are in the process of}} developing an instrument to examine the validity of these claims, in addition to collecting information about our students’ career aspirations with respect to psychology. Some of the preliminary results from this survey indicate that a small proportion of students (between 10 and 20 %) describe themselves as being quite anxious about computing, <b>mathematics</b> and statistics. <b>Anxiety</b> is higher among female students.

40|$|Prior {{research}} shows a complex relationship between <b>mathematics</b> and statistics <b>anxiety,</b> self-efficacy and performance. The interaction {{of these factors}} {{is thought to be}} counterproductive to mathematics and statistics learning. Methodological problems and conflicting results are evident in intervention research, the majority of which have focused on performance deficits within the classroom. While performance is an important factor, anxiety is a greater determinant of future enrolment and avoidance of maths and stats in university and the workforce. Anxiety also has a negative effect on memory which can further compromise performance. Therefore, Cognitive Behavioural therapies are recommended to combat anxiety. Attrition, time and cost are common deterrents to this approach however. Online Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (OCBT) can address these issues and has been effective in combating a number of anxiety related disorders. The current research developed an OCBT program using short multimedia clips to combat <b>mathematics</b> and statistics <b>anxiety</b> and improve approach behaviours in Psychology students. Initial usability data provided positive feedback about the content, accessibility, and ease of use for this program from participants of different ages and educational backgrounds.

40|$|Mathematics {{education}} {{researchers have}} investigated <b>mathematics</b> <b>anxiety</b> in prospective elementary teachers. While {{many of these}} {{studies have focused on}} the bodily sensations and emotions of <b>mathematics</b> <b>anxiety,</b> particularly those felt in assessment situations, opportunities remain to investigate how prospective elementary teachers interpret their experiences with <b>mathematics</b> <b>anxiety</b> and connect them over time to compose personal histories of <b>mathematics</b> <b>anxiety.</b> Currently, over 90 % of elementary teachers in US schools are women, and women have been shown to suffer more from <b>mathematics</b> <b>anxiety</b> than do men. In this article, I analyze how one woman prospective elementary teacher described, explained, and related her experiences of <b>mathematics</b> <b>anxiety</b> across her personal narratives of learning mathematics as a K- 12 student and of learning to teach mathematics as a college student in a teacher preparation program. My research demonstrates that experiences of <b>mathematics</b> <b>anxiety</b> may persist beyond assessment situations to influence women prospective elementary teachers’ larger mathematical histories. I also show that women prospective elementary teachers may interpret <b>mathematics</b> <b>anxiety</b> as specific fears (e. g., loss of opportunities for social participation) and may develop particular coping strategies related to those fears. Finally, I point out that while a coping strategy may be used consistently across K- 12 mathematics learning and undergraduate teacher preparation, and may even offer a woman prospective elementary teacher some relief from <b>mathematics</b> <b>anxiety,</b> it may also limit her mathematics learning and professional development. To conclude, I present implications of my research for mathematics teacher educators...|$|E
40|$|Test {{anxiety and}} <b>{{mathematics}}</b> <b>anxiety</b> {{have been found}} to relate to mathematics performance in both children and adults. This study investigated <b>mathematics</b> <b>anxiety</b> in elementary teachers and whether those who experience <b>mathematics</b> <b>anxiety</b> also have professional anxiety about teaching mathematics. A researcher-developed instrument called the McAnallen Anxiety in Mathematics Teaching Survey (MAMTS) was administered to a sample of 691 teachers from eight states representing geographically diverse areas of the United States in rural, urban, and suburban communities. Responses were used to investigate <b>mathematics</b> <b>anxiety</b> in elementary teachers as well as several demographic questions. The majority of the respondents had only taken Algebra I as their most advanced course in high school, and approximately 40 % of these participants had enrolled in lower level or what might be considered remedial level mathematics courses in college. Approximately 33 % of the participants reported that they had <b>mathematics</b> <b>anxiety</b> and higher levels of <b>mathematics</b> <b>anxiety</b> led to decreased feelings of enjoyment about mathematics. <b>Mathematics</b> <b>anxiety</b> was initially experienced in the primary grades by 12 % of respondents, in the elementary grades by 26 %, in middle school by 22 %, and later by the remaining 40 % of those who experienced <b>mathematics</b> <b>anxiety.</b> The participants who reported having <b>mathematics</b> <b>anxiety</b> attributed it to negative elementary or secondary interactions with teachers about mathematics, poor teaching practices while they were in school, and/or negative experiences taking algebra or geometry in high school. ...|$|E
40|$|Every {{student who}} enrols in a degree {{programme}} involving service mathematics in the University of Limerick in Ireland {{is given a}} mathematics diagnostic test. The diagnostic test was developed due to <b>mathematics</b> lecturers’ <b>anxiety</b> regarding students’ mathematical competency levels. Students receive the 40 question paper-based test in their first service mathematics lecture without prior notification. Initial analysis of students’ work revealed that many students were having difficulties with basic algebra and arithmetic in particular [Gill, O. 2006. “What Counts as Service Mathematics? An Investigation into the ‘Mathematics Problem’ in Ireland. ” PhD diss., University of Limerick]. Further research highlighted the significant decline in diagnostic test performance and the changing profile of service mathematics students between 1998 and 2008 [Faulkner, Fiona, Ailish Hannigan, and Olivia Gill. 2010. “Trends in the Mathematical Competency of University Entrants in Ireland by Leaving Certificate Mathematics Grade. ” Teaching Mathematics and Its Applications 29 (2) : 76 – 93]. One of the most notable changes to the student profile over time was the increase in mature students (non-standard students) entering service mathematics programmes. Although non-standard students had a lower mean performance in the diagnostic test, they {{were found to have}} a higher mean performance in some cases in service mathematics compared to standard students. This paper explores some of the possible reasons for such findings...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{relationship}} between school anxiety and academic achievement of students. This study analyzed the relationship between school anxiety and academic achievement in a sample of 520 Spanish students from 12 to 18 years (M = 15. 38, SD = 1. 95). Results revealed that students with high performance in Spanish language (language and literature) had significantly higher scores in anxiety faced with school failure and punishment, anxiety faced with aggression, behavioral anxiety and psychophysiological anxiety. Similarly, students with high performance in mathematics had significantly higher scores in anxiety faced with school failure and punishment, anxiety faced with aggression and behavioral anxiety. Furthermore, students with academic success scored significantly higher in anxiety faced with school failure and punishment, behavioral anxiety and psychophysiological anxiety. However, students with school failure had significantly higher scores on anxiety faced with social evaluation. Finally, anxiety faced with school failure and punishment {{was a significant predictor of}} high achievement in Spanish language (language and literature) and <b>mathematics,</b> whereas <b>anxiety</b> faced with school failure and punishment and anxiety faced with social evaluation were significant predictors of overall academic success. Thus, the results indicate a higher academic performance of students who have certain fears school. These results could be used by teachers, school psychologists and clinical psychologists as an empirical basis to develop preventive and effective intervention of underachievement...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the academic performance}} of students in a first year undergraduate mathematics course at a regional university.  A custom designed questionnaire which assessed study behaviours, staff support and peer and family relationships and the levels of <b>mathematics</b> efficacy and <b>anxiety</b> was completed by 162 students.  The study established a wide range of mathematical efficacy based upon the number and type of mathematics courses completed at the secondary level of education and identifies this as the primary factor in student failure in the course.  The need for institutions to acknowledge the diversity of student preparedness in mathematics at the first year undergraduate level and respond through the use of academic staff with appropriate educational training and a caring and supportive teaching pedagogy is described.  The capacity of a single one-size-fits-all mathematics course in the first semester of undergraduate study {{to meet the needs of}} all students is discussed. </em...|$|R
