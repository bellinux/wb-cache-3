5|$|Ancient weather {{forecasting}} methods usually relied on observed patterns of events, also termed pattern recognition. For example, {{it might be}} observed that if the sunset was particularly red, the following day often brought fair weather. This experience accumulated over the generations to produce weather lore. However, {{not all of these}} predictions prove reliable, and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>have</b> since been found not to stand up to rigorous statistical testing.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of his death, Massenet was {{regarded}} by many critics as old-fashioned and unadventurous although his two best-known operas remained popular in France and abroad. After a few decades of neglect, his works began to be favourably reassessed during the mid-20th century, and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>have</b> since been staged and recorded. Although critics do not rank him among the handful of outstanding operatic geniuses such as Mozart, Verdi and Wagner, his operas are now widely accepted as well-crafted and intelligent products of the Belle Époque.|$|E

5|$|Thirteen sets of Song {{printed books}} have been {{designated}} as National Treasures. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>have</b> been handed down in feudal era Japanese clans and were stored at libraries such as Kanazawa Bunko, Ashikaga Gakko or at monasteries {{such as the one}} of Tōfuku-ji. They cover mainly Chinese Classics such as books and commentaries on Records of the Grand Historian, the Book of Han, the Book of Later Han, Classic of History, Book of Rites, Book of Songs or the Book of Changes. Two are encyclopedias.|$|E
5|$|Open water {{fish are}} usually {{streamlined}} like torpedoes to minimize turbulence {{as they move}} through the water. Reef fish live in a complex, relatively confined underwater landscape and for them, manoeuvrability {{is more important than}} speed, and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>have</b> developed bodies which optimize their ability to dart and change direction. Many have laterally compressed bodies (flattened from side to side) allowing them to fit into fissures and swim through narrow gaps; some use their pectoral fins for locomotion and others undulate their dorsal and anal fins. Some fish have grown dermal (skin) appendages for camouflage; the prickly leather-jacket is almost invisible among the seaweed it resembles and the tasselled scorpionfish invisibly lurks on the seabed ready to ambush prey. Some like the foureye butterflyfish have eyespots to startle or deceive, while others such as lionfish have aposematic coloration to warn that they are toxic or have venomous spines.|$|E
5|$|The bulk {{properties}} of astatine {{are not known}} with any certainty. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>have</b> been estimated based on the element's position on the periodic table as a heavier analog of iodine, {{and a member of}} the halogens (the group of elements including fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine). Astatine is likely to have a dark or lustrous appearance and may be a semiconductor or possibly a metal; it probably has a higher melting point than that of iodine. Chemically, several anionic species of astatine are known and most of its compounds resemble those of iodine. It also shows some metallic behavior, including being able to form a stable monatomic cation in aqueous solution (unlike the lighter halogens).|$|E

50|$|The Royalist and Parliamentarian {{artillery}} trains were roughly equally matched. Although Essex {{had more}} guns overall, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> lagged {{behind on the}} march.|$|R
5|$|Many of the fortifications at {{sea level}} have survived, though not always in their {{original}} condition. A substantial number have been built over. The Inundation was drained after World War II {{and is now the}} site of the Laguna Estate, named after the Inundation's lagoon. The glacis was likewise used as the foundations of the Glacis Estate. The flat ground of the retired batteries made them prime building spots during Gibraltar's post-war building boom, thus <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>have</b> disappeared under recent developments. The city walls have almost entirely survived and are progressively being cleared of modern structures to restore them to something more like their original appearance. However, they are no longer at the water's edge due to extensive land reclamation. Various parts of the fortifications have been converted to civilian use. After being used for some years as a hostel for Moroccan migrant workers, the Grand Casemates Barracks have been renovated and converted into restaurants and shops. An electricity generating station was built inside the King's Bastion in the 1960s but has since been demolished and the bastion has been converted into a leisure centre.|$|E
5|$|The East Stand at Old Trafford was {{the second}} to be {{converted}} to a cantilever roof, following the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand. It is also {{commonly referred to as}} the Scoreboard End, as it was the location of the scoreboard. The East Stand can currently hold nearly 12,000fans, and is the location of both the disabled fans section and the away section; an experiment involving the relocation of away fans to the third tier of the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand was conducted during the 2011–12 season, but the results of the experiments could not be ascertained in time to make the move permanent for the 2012–13 season. The disabled section provides for up to 170 fans, with free seats for carers. Old Trafford was formerly divided into sections, with each section sequentially assigned a letter of the alphabet. Although every section had a letter, it is the K Stand that is the most commonly referred to today. The K Stand fans were renowned for their vocal support for the club, and a large array of chants and songs, though <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>have</b> relocated to the second tier of the West Stand.|$|E

25|$|As {{opposed to}} the east-west streets, the north-south avenues have {{undergone}} some significant changes. They have, for one thing, increased in number, and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>have</b> been re-named over the years.|$|E
25|$|Imprints are {{brand names}} in publishing. Elsevier uses its {{imprints}} to market to different consumer segments. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>have</b> previously been the company names of publishers that were purchased by Reed Elsevier.|$|E

25|$|These {{organizations}} are government-funded research organizations, though <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>have</b> special status {{to give them}} power of administration separate from the Japanese government.

25|$|Along {{with other}} forms of culture, {{there have been many}} songs related to the topic of nuclear weapons and warfare. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>have</b> been protest songs or warning songs, while others use the motif as an allusion to great {{destruction}} in general.|$|E

25|$|Not long after, Pavlo Skoropadskyi {{was removed}} from power in an {{uprising}} led by Symon Petliura.
