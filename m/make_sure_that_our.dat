2500|$|During the 2012 presidential {{election}} campaign, Romney took positions on agricultural subsidies that some media reports characterized as vague and somewhat contradictory. In May 2011, {{just days after}} rival Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty had declared that federal subsidies {{for the production of}} ethanol fuel should be phased out, Romney said that he was a supporter of ethanol subsidies. Five months later, while speaking on agricultural subsidies at a roundtable discussion with Iowa farmers and business leaders, Romney said, “I’m not running for office based on making promises of handing out money.... We’re {{going to have to live}} within our means.” He also said that while he had supported ethanol subsidies in the past in order to help the ethanol fuel industry become established, and that he continued to believe that ethanol should play a role in meeting the nation’s energy needs, he agreed with the discontinuation of the tax credit for production of ethanol from corn that was scheduled to occur two months later. On the subject of agricultural subsidies more generally, Romney wrote in response to a 2012 questionnaire from the American Farm Bureau Federation that [...] "other nations subsidize their farmers, so we [...] must be careful not to unilaterally change our policies in a way that would [...] disadvantage agriculture here in our country." [...] He made similar remarks on the campaign trail in August 2012, without explicitly referring to subsidies: [...] "We don't want to find ourselves with regards to our food supply in the same kind of position we are in with our energy supply, so it's important for us to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> farmers are able to stay on the farm and raise the crops that we need to have a secure source of food. So I believe in supports that will allow us to do that." ...|$|E
60|$|Buller was {{now moving}} with a rapidity and {{decision}} which contrast pleasantly {{with some of}} his earlier operations. Although Dundee was only occupied on May 15th, on May 18th his vanguard was in Newcastle, fifty miles to the north. In nine days he had covered 138 miles. On the 19th the army lay under the loom of that Majuba which had cast its sinister shadow for so long over South African politics. In front was the historical Laing's Nek, the pass which leads from Natal into the Transvaal, while through it runs the famous railway tunnel. Here the Boers had taken up that position which had proved nineteen years before to be too strong for British troops. The Rooineks had come back after many days to try again. A halt was called, for the ten days' supplies which had been taken with the troops were exhausted, and it was necessary to wait until the railway should be repaired. This gave time for Hildyard's 5th Division and Lyttelton's 4th Division to close up on Clery's 2nd Division, which with Dundonald's cavalry had formed our vanguard throughout. The only losses of any consequence during this fine march fell upon a single squadron of Bethune's mounted infantry, which being thrown out in the direction of Vryheid, in order to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> flank was clear, fell into an ambuscade and was almost annihilated by a close-range fire. Sixty-six casualties, of which nearly half were killed, were the result of this action, which seems to have depended, like most of our reverses, upon defective scouting. Buller, having called up his two remaining divisions and having mended the railway behind him, proceeded now to manoeuvre the Boers out of Laing's Nek exactly as he had manoeuvred them out of the Biggarsberg. At the end of May Hildyard and Lyttelton were despatched in an eastern direction, as if there were an intention of turning the pass from Utrecht.|$|E

40|$|The {{welfare state}} is {{challenged}} by the globalisation {{of the world economy}} and by the fact that ageing populations demand more redistribution. To promote political and social sustainability in this context, the “destructive” forces of market competition have to be met by “constructive ” social policies. In Europe, the Scandinavian countries are the best performers in combining inequality reductions with high employment rates and excellent growth records. A framework for reform inspired by this starts from the notion that in order to be successful in meeting new needs with restricted resources we must improve incentives, human resources, social services and employment opportunities. The ageing of our societies means we also need to rethink our policies in other ways. The discussion has, however, been unduly focused on pension reforms and savings to ensure future living standards for the elderly. Instead, we should focus more on how social policy interacts with education, fertility and other fundamental determinants of the future tax base. In order to design social policies that are sustainable for the future, we need to put our children and youth first. The Swedish case is relevant here, with its institutions that promote gender balance and investment in life-long learning. We should, however, <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> we base <b>our</b> policy recommendations not on wishful thinking but on a knowledge-based and realistic assessment of how the world works. ChALLENgES: gLObALISATION AND AgEINg POPuLATIONS The globalisation of the world economy is most often perceived as a threat to national systems of social protection. It is not all that clear, however, why the welfare state is not possible for nation states with open economies. The old conventional wisdom used to be that most open economies among the advanced industrial societies also had developed the most generous social security systems, as an alternative, in fact, to the kind of social protection that high tariffs and other import restrictions offered domestic employment...|$|R

50|$|A {{specific}} {{sequence of}} tasks and start times (genes) represents one genome in our population. To <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> genome is a feasible solution {{we must take}} care that it obeys our precedence constraints. We generate an initial population using random start times within the precedence constraints. With genetic algorithms we then take this initial population and cross it, combining genomes along {{with a small amount}} of randomness (mutation). The offspring of this combination is selected based on a fitness function that includes one or many of our constraints, such as minimizing time and minimizing defects. We let this process continue either for a pre-allotted time or until we find a solution that fits our minimum criteria. Overall each successive generation will have a greater average fitness, i.e. taking less time with higher quality than the preceding generations. In scheduling problems, as with other genetic algorithm solutions, we must make sure that we do not select offspring that are infeasible, such as offspring that violate our precedence constraint. We of course may have to add further fitness values such as minimizing costs; however, each constraint that we add greatly increases the search space and lowers the number of solutions that are good matches.|$|E
