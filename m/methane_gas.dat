Anaerobic microorganisms reduce sludge solids producing <b>methane</b> <b>gas</b> and a sterile mineralised residue. In potable water treatment, one method, the slow sand filter, employs a complex gelatinous layer {{composed of a}} wide range of microorganisms to remove both dissolved and particulate material from raw water.|$|E

The book contains additional information, scientific analysis, and Gore's commentary on the issues presented in the documentary. A 2007 documentary entitled An Update with Former Vice President Al Gore features Gore discussing additional information that came to light after the film was completed, such as Hurricane Katrina, coral reef depletion, glacial earthquake activity on the Greenland ice sheet, wildfires, and trapped <b>methane</b> <b>gas</b> release associated with permafrost melting.|$|E
5|$|As {{with any}} heavy industry, the {{possibility}} of serious injury or death was an everyday risk for the mine workers of the Rhondda Valley. The most notorious form of colliery disaster was the gas explosion, caused by either a buildup of <b>methane</b> <b>gas</b> or coal dust. As the mines became deeper and ventilation become more difficult to control the risk increased. The worst single incident in the Rhondda was the 1867 Ferndale disaster in which an explosion saw the loss of 178 lives. However, the major disasters only accounted for roughly 20% of overall fatalities, with individual accidents accounting {{for the bulk of}} deaths. The list below shows mining disasters which saw the loss of five or more lives during a single incident.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Green Line past Anacostia Station was {{complicated}} by {{the discovery of a}} potential toxic waste site {{in the path of the}} subway. In June 1991, WMATA discovered that the District of Columbia had dumped 426,000 tons of possibly hazardous incinerator bottom ash in an unused exposed culvert along the subway's potential path near St. Elizabeth's Hospital between 1977 and 1989. The city continued to dump the ash at the site for four years after it learned that WMATA planned to use the site for the Green Line. Experts were concerned that the ash dump contained pockets of <b>methane</b> <b>gas</b> and soluble acid, which would make the site unusable by Metrorail.|$|E

40|$|Measurements made by {{multiple}} analytical facilities {{can only be}} comparable if they are related to a unifying and traceable reference. However, reference materials that fulfil these fundamental requirements are unavailable {{for the analysis of}} isotope ratios in atmospheric methane, which led to misinterpretations of combined data sets in the past. We developed a method to produce a suite of standard gases {{that can be used to}} unify methane isotope ratio measurements of laboratories in the atmospheric monitoring community. We calibrated a suite of pure <b>methane</b> <b>gases</b> of different methanogenic origin against 20 international referencing materials that define the VSMOW and VPDB isotope scales. The isotope ratios of our pure <b>methane</b> <b>gases</b> range between − 320 and + 40 ‰ for δ 2 H-CH 4 and between − 70 and − 40 ‰ for δ 13 C-CH 4, enveloping the isotope ratios of tropospheric methane (about − 90 ‰ and − 47 ‰ for δ 2 H-CH 4 and δ 13 C-CH 4, respectively). We estimate combined uncertainties for our δ 2 H and δ 13 C calibrations of < 1. 5 ‰ and < 0. 2 ‰, respectively. Aliquots of the calibrated pure <b>methane</b> <b>gases</b> have been diluted with methane-free air to atmospheric methane levels and filled 25 into 5 -L glass flasks. These synthetic gas mixtures comprise atmospheric oxygen/nitrogen ratios as well as appropriate argon, krypton and nitrous oxide mole fractions to prevent gas-specific measurement artefacts. The resulting synthetic atmospheric reference gases will be available to the atmospheric monitoring community. This will provide unifying isotope scale anchors for isotope ratio measurements of atmospheric methane so that data sets can be merged into a consistent global data frame...|$|R
5|$|Paris is {{provided}} in electricity through a 'periphery' grid fed by multiple sources., around 50% of electricity generated in the Île-de-France comes from cogeneration energy plants located near the outer limits of the region; other energy sources include the Nogent nuclear power plant (35%), trash incineration (9% – with cogeneration plants, these provide the city in heat as well), <b>methane</b> <b>gas</b> (5%), hydraulics (1%), solar power (0.1%) and a negligible amount of wind power (0.034 GWh).

5|$|Carbon is {{essential}} to all known living systems, and without it {{life as we know}} it could not exist (see alternative biochemistry). The major economic use of carbon other than food and wood is in the form of hydrocarbons, most notably the fossil fuel <b>methane</b> <b>gas</b> and crude oil (petroleum). Crude oil is distilled in refineries by the petrochemical industry to produce gasoline, kerosene, and other products. Cellulose is a natural, carbon-containing polymer produced by plants in the form of wood, cotton, linen, and hemp. Cellulose is used primarily for maintaining structure in plants. Commercially valuable carbon polymers of animal origin include wool, cashmere and silk. Plastics are made from synthetic carbon polymers, often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included at regular intervals in the main polymer chain. The raw materials for many of these synthetic substances come from crude oil.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda's {{electricity}} supply was, {{until the early}} 2000s, generated almost entirely from hydroelectric sources; power stations on Lakes Burera and Ruhondo provided 90% of the country's electricity. A combination of below average rainfall and human activity, including the draining of the Rugezi wetlands for cultivation and grazing, caused the two lakes' water levels to fall from 1990 onwards; by 2004 levels were reduced by 50%, leading to {{a sharp drop in}} output from the power stations. This, coupled with increased demand as the economy grew, precipitated a shortfall in 2004 and widespread loadshedding. As an emergency measure, the government installed diesel generators north of Kigali; by 2006 these were providing 56% of the country's electricity, but were very costly. The government enacted a number of measures to alleviate this problem, including rehabilitating the Rugezi wetlands, which supply water to Burera and Ruhondo and investing in a scheme to extract <b>methane</b> <b>gas</b> from Lake Kivu, expected in its first phase to increase the country's power generation by 40%. Only 18% of the population had access to electricity in 2012, though this had risen from 10.8% in 2009. The government's Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy for 2013–18 aims to increase access to electricity to 70% of households by 2017.|$|E
