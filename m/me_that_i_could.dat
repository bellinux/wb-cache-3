There were terrible moments that encompassed a lifetime, an endlessness, when terror was so strong in <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> feel idiocy replace reason. (Yet,) I have never left my position, nor have I shirked hazardous duty. Fear {{did not make a}} coward out of me.|$|E

500|$|Lody {{began an}} {{apprenticeship}} at {{a grocery store}} in Halle in 1891, before moving to Hamburg two years later to join {{the crew of the}} sailing ship Sirius as a cabin boy. He studied at the maritime academy in Geestemünde, qualifying as a helmsman, and immediately afterwards served with the Imperial German Navy for a year between 1900 and 1901. Subsequently joining the First Naval Reserve, he enlisted as an officer on German merchant ships. In 1904 he returned to Geestemünde, where he successfully obtained a captain's licence. He fell seriously ill with what he later said was a stomach abscess, [...] "caused from a very badly cured typhoid attack of fever from which I suffered in Italy on account of the bad water at Genoa." [...] An operation was required, which weakened his left arm and his eyesight. As Lody put it, [...] "Consequently, my career as a seaman was closed as soon as I discovered that, and my doctor told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not go any further." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Rhimes said she tried {{to talk him out}} of quitting, explaining: [...] "I looked in his face and he was really sure. It felt like the right thing for him." [...] However, in another interview, Knight said of his exit: [...] "My five-year experience proved to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not trust any answer that was given [...]" [...] Knight was [...] "at peace" [...] with his departure, saying: [...] "There just comes a time when it's so clear that moving on is the best decision." [...] However, Heigl tried to talk Knight out of leaving, saying: [...] "I didn't think it was the right decision. I felt like some of the problems could be worked through. But by the time it came to fruition, I was [...] for him because he was ready to go." [...] On the topic of losing a US$14 million contract, Knight commented: [...] "From an outsider's perspective, I get the [...] 'He's just a spoiled actor, he doesn’t know how good he has it.' There are a lot of people who would like to be in my position. But in the end, I need to be fulfilled in my work." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later in 1990, Alexandru Stefu (another {{old friend}} from Romania) invited Comăneci and Panait to Montreal, {{where he was}} staying {{with his family and}} Béla Károlyi. Comăneci noted in her memoir that after they arrived in Montreal, andwhen he finally had an {{opportunity}} to get me alone, Alexandru asked what was next for me. I told him that I was thinking about staying in Montreal, but hadn't yet mentioned the idea to [...] because he'd already booked us on a flight back to Los Angeles. The next day, Alexandru sent me to meet with the director of the Olympic stadium, who told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do some exhibitions and appearances for him [...] When I woke up the next morning and went downstairs, Alexandru told me that [...] was gone. I never heard from him again, but I hope he is well and thank him for his help. I realize that our business relationship may have tarnished my name and image, but I safely escaped from Romania, and that is truly what was most important. There wasn't too much time to figure out why [...] had left because very soon after his departure, CNN contacted me.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{the idea}} of gaining a day, Verne said of its origin: [...] "I have {{a great number of}} {{scientific}} odds and ends in my head. It was thus that, when, one day in a Paris café, I read in the Siècle that a man could travel around the world in 80 days, it immediately struck <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> profit by a difference of meridian and make my traveller gain or lose a day in his journey. There was a dénouement ready found. The story was not written until long after. I carry ideas about in my head for years – ten, or 15 years, sometimes – before giving them form." [...] In his April 1873 lecture, [...] "The Meridians and the Calendar", Verne responded to a question about where the change of day actually occurred, since the international date line had only become current in 1880 and the Greenwich prime meridian was not adopted internationally until 1884. Verne cited an 1872 article in Nature, and Edgar Allan Poe's short story [...] "Three Sundays in a Week" [...] (1841), which was also based on going around the world and the difference in a day linked to a marriage at the end. Verne even analysed Poe's story in his Edgar Poe and His Works (1864). Poe's story [...] "Three Sundays in a Week" [...] was clearly the inspiration for the lost day plot device.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why didn't {{you tell}} <b>me,</b> so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have had them made? It's impossible,--impossible that one brain should {{think of it}} all. Are you sure you've got enough hands in the kitchen?" ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{second level}} of {{existence}} is the ethical. This is where an individual {{begins to take}} on a true direction in life, becoming aware of and personally responsible for good and evil and forming a commitment to oneself and others. One's actions at this level of existence have a consistency and coherence that they lacked in the previous sphere of existence. For many readers of Kierkegaard, the ethical is central. It calls each individual to take account of their lives and to scrutinize their actions in terms of absolute responsibility, which is what Kierkegaard calls repentance. If we compare Kierkegaard's idea of ethics with Vedic system of four aims of life, this Ethical system probably correlates most with Dharma - following this or that religion,set of rules, laws etc. (Hindus would call any religion as [...] "dharma", though dharma is also a law). [...] "He repents himself back into himself, back into the family, back into the race, until he finds himself in God. Only on this condition can he choose himself. And this is the only condition he wants, for only in this way can he choose himself absolutely." .... “I repent myself out of the whole existence. Repentance specifically expresses that evil essentially belongs to me {{and at the same time}} expresses that it does not essentially belong to me. If the evil in me did not essentially belong to me, I could not choose it; but if there were something in <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not choose absolutely, then I would not be choosing myself absolutely at all, then I myself would not be the absolute but only a product." .... "It is a sign of a well brought up child to be inclined to say it is sorry without too much pondering whether it is in the right or not, and it is likewise a sign of a high-minded person and a deep soul if he is inclined to repent, if he does not take God to court but repents and loves God in his repentance. Without this, his life is nothing, only like foam." ... "The Either/Or I erected between living esthetically and living ethically is not an unqualified dilemma, because it actually is a matter of only one choice. Through this choice, I actually choose between good and evil, but I choose the good, I choose eo ipso the choice between good and evil. The original choice is forever present in every succeeding choice." [...] Søren Kierkegaard, Either/Or Part II, Hong, p. 216-217, 224, 237-238, 219 ...|$|E

60|$|Now as I spoke thus {{it seemed}} to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> a cold and dreadful air played upon my hands and brow and a warning sense of present evil crept into my soul, {{overcoming}} <b>me</b> so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not stir or speak for a while.|$|R
