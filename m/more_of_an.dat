5|$|A gull colony {{has been}} present since 1984, {{although}} gulls were seen briefly {{on the shores}} of the new island only weeks after it first appeared. The gull colony has been particularly important in developing the plant life on Surtsey, and the gulls have had much <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> impact on plant colonisation than other breeding species due to their abundance. An expedition in 2004 found the first evidence of nesting Atlantic puffins, which are extremely common {{in the rest of the}} archipelago.|$|E

5|$|Before Lauper {{covered the}} song, the band The Cars {{produced}} {{an early version}} of it that was not released. Shear's version was originally a folk rock song, but Lauper instead turned it into a pop ballad for her album, with a heavy emphasis on a synthesizer. According to Lauper, she wanted it to be just like Shear's version, with a bit <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> acoustic sound. However, she changed her mind, saying that she wanted to sing it like herself. Unlike her other singles from the album, this one did not have a music video released with it.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being the}} draft {{that got the}} film green-lit, Straczynski's script was tossed aside. Production was to begin {{at the start of}} 2009, but was delayed while the script was {{completely}} re-written by Matthew Michael Carnahan to set the film in the present, leaving behind much of the book's premise to make it <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> action film.

5000|$|Ipomoea coccinea {{are often}} {{confused}} with Ipomoea quamoclit since they {{the flowers are}} similar. However, {{the leaves of the}} two species are very different.

5|$|Just {{like the}} {{evolution}} of Philippine music, dance as well has been in constant change. Prior to colonial rule, the Philippines has {{a wide array of}} ethnic dances from different tribal groups. This is due mainly to the fact that Philippines is an archipelago thus the different varieties of dance developed. Both Luzon and Visayas, at first, were more akin to tribal movements until the Spanish came. Mindanao represents <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> array of Muslim inspired dances and Spanish influence was minimal in the region of Zamboanga.|$|E
