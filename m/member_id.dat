40|$|In many applications, it {{is desired}} to {{dynamically}} establish temporary multicast groups for secure message delivery. It is also {{often the case}} that the group membership information itself is sensitive and needs to be well protected. However, existing solutions either fail {{to address the issue of}} membership anonymity or do not scale well for dynamically established groups. In this paper, we propose a highly scalable solution for dynamical multicast group setup and yet protecting group membership anonymity simultaneously. In the proposed solution, scalability and membership anonymity are achieved via a novel design that integrates both ciphertextpolicy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) and centralized flat table (CFT) techniques. In our design, multicast groups are specified through group member attributes represented through binary <b>member</b> <b>ID</b> only and thus achieves scalability. Also, high level of membership anonymity is guaranteed such that every group member knows nothing but his own group membership only. The proposed solution is also efficient in communication, that is, the ciphertext size is only O(n), where n is the length of a group <b>member</b> <b>ID</b> and independent to the group size. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A new {{fundamental}} and secure group key management approach {{with a group}} controller GC using the theory of polynomial functions over a vector space over finite field is developed, where each member in the group corresponds to a vector in the vector space and the GC computes a central vector, whose inner product with every <b>member’s</b> <b>ID</b> vector are identical. The central vector is published and each member can compute a common group key via inner product. The security relies {{on the fact that}} any illegitimate user cannot calculate this value without the legitimate vector, therefore cannot derive the group key. This approach is secure and its backward and forward secrecy can be guaranteed. The performance of our approach is analyzed to demonstrate its advantages in comparison with others, which include: 1) it requires both small memory and little computations for each group member; 2) it can handle massive membership change efficiently with only two re-keying messages, i. e., the central vector and a random number; 3) it is very efficient and very scalable for large size groups. Our experiments confirm these advantages and the implementation of our prototype presents very satisfactory performance for large size groups...|$|R

There are four {{members in the}} Id protein family termed Idl- 4. In prostate cancer the expression of Idl and Id 3 is high, whereas <b>member</b> <b>Id</b> 4 expression is low. Decreased expression of Id 4 is due to promoter hypermethylation in prostate cancer {{as well as many}} other cancers. This observation led us to hypothesize that Id 4 acts as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer. Furthermore, evidence suggests ectopic Id 4 expression in metastatic prostate cancer cell line DU 145 induced cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence. In this study, we expanded on these earlier studies to demonstrate that gain of Id 4 attenuates cancer phenotype whereas loss of Id 4 promotes cancer phenotype in prostate cancer cell lines DU 145 and LNCaP, respectively. Upon over-expression of Id 4 in DU 145 cells (DU 145 +W 4), there was an increase in apoptosis, due to decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and increased expression of 1 pro-apoptotic markers (PUMA, BAX, and p 21).

40|$|The {{establishment}} of distant metastases {{depends on the}} capacity of small numbers of cancer cells to regenerate a tumor after entering a target tissue. The mechanisms that confer this capacity remain to be defined. Here we identify a role for the transcriptional inhibitors of differentiation Id 1 and Id 3 as selective mediators of lung metastatic colonization in the triple negative [TN, i. e., lacking expression of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, and lacking Her 2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) amplification] subgroup of human breast cancer. Although broad expression of Id 1 has recently been documented in tumors of the rare metaplastic subtype, here we report that rare Id 1 -expressing cells are also present in the more common TN subset of human breast tumors but not in other subtypes. We also provide evidence that Id 1 expression is enriched in clinically obtained hormone receptor negative lung metastases. Functional studies demonstrate that Id 1 and its closely related family <b>member</b> <b>Id</b> 3 are required for tumor initiating functions, both {{in the context of}} primary tumor formation and during metastatic colonization of the lung microenvironment. In vivo characterization of lung metastatic progression reveals that Id 1 and Id 3 facilitate sustained proliferation during the early stages of metastatic colonization, subsequent to extravasation into the lung parenchyma. These results shed light on the proliferative mechanisms that initiate metastatic colonization, and they implicate Id 1 and Id 3 as mediators of this malignant function in the TN subgroup of breast cancers...|$|E
30|$|Adversaries can deploy {{malicious}} sensor nodes {{which are}} clones of a compromised sensor node, say A, into multiple {{locations in the}} sensor network. There are two scenarios. The first scenario is that a clone is deployed at one location distant from A’s original location in the same cluster as A. This will be detected by the corresponding cluster head if the clone sends a join message to the cluster head. The second scenario is that a clone is deployed in the different cluster from A. The base station can be aware of which cluster the clone wants to join during the sensor node join phase because it knows each <b>member’s</b> <b>ID</b> and the corresponding location of each cluster if A has joined a cluster at one location before. Once the base station knows that the clone of a compromised sensor node may be deployed {{in the vicinity of}} a certain cluster head, it can reject the clone’s join message. Therefore, the base station can make a judgment that A is a compromised sensor node and then takes the appropriate action in order to revoke A.|$|R

Upon over-expression of Id 4 in DU 145 cells (DU 145 +W 4), there was an increase in apoptosis, due to decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and increased expression of pro-apoptotic markers (PUMA, BAX, and p 21). Inversely, silencing of Id 4 in LNCaP cells (LNCaP-Id 4) led to decreased apoptosis due to an intact mitochondrial membrane and decrease in the expression of pro-apoptotic markers (PUMA, BAX, and p 21). Since BAX, PUMA, and p 21 are direct transcriptional targets of p 53, these results therefore prompted us to investigate the effect of Id 4 on expression and activity of p 53. LNCaP cells express wild-type p 53. DU 145 cells harbor mutant p 53 (P 223 L and V 274 F), which lies within the DNA binding domain and abrogates p 53 transcriptional activity. DU 145 cells also express high levels of p 53, due extended half-life. Surprisingly, there was decreased expression of p 53 in DU 145 +Id 4 cells associated with nuclear localization indicating enhanced transcriptional activity. We investigated p 53 DNA binding and transcriptional activity. We determined that mutant p 53 in DU 145 +Id 4 cells was transcriptionally active evident by increased luciferase activity and binding of p 53 to the promoters of its targets. In LNCaP-Id 4, p 53 expression was decreased which resulted in decreased p 53 transcriptional activity and decreased DNA binding ability. The data suggested that Id 4 can restore mutant p 53 activity, which is a significant observation. Our results also suggest that Id 4 promotes the assembly of a macromolecular complex involving CBP/p 300 that results in acetylation of p 53 at K 373, a critical post-translational modification required for its biological activity. Loss of Id 4 in LNCaP cells also abrogated wild type p 53 DNA binding and transcriptional activity with concomitant loss of CBP/p 300 requirement and decreased acetylation. In conclusion, we demonstrated that loss of Id 4 promotes cancer phenotype in LNCaP cells. We also demonstrated that the tumor suppressor activity of Id 4 is in part through regulation of CBP/p 300 dependent acetylation and function of p 53...|$|E
