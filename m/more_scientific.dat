5|$|Priestley {{published}} <b>more</b> <b>scientific</b> items {{during his}} decade in the United States than during all {{his years in}} England: some 45 papers, not counting reprintings, and four pamphlets, not counting subsequent editions, but in general his science was now anticlimactic. Few of his papers contributed anything significantly new {{to the field of}} chemistry; most were committed to combatting the new chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Wilkinson's Dazzle {{camouflage}} {{was accepted}} by the Admiralty, even without practical visual assessment protocols for improving performance by modifying designs and colours. The dazzle camouflage strategy was adopted by other navies. This led to <b>more</b> <b>scientific</b> studies of colour options which might enhance camouflage effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaurs {{gained a}} home in {{television}} in the 1960s animated sitcom The Flintstones, in another example of dinosaurs shown as coexisting with humans (for comedic effect in this case). Dinosaurs also entered comic books in this period in such series as Tor and Turok, where prehistoric humans fought anachronistic dinosaurs. For those wanting <b>more</b> <b>scientific</b> accounts of dinosaurs, there were the first nontechnical dinosaur books. Ned Colbert's The Dinosaur Book (1945) was the first such book, and its status as the only such book for many years made Colbert an important figure for the coming generations of paleontologists and dinosaur enthusiasts.|$|E

5|$|In 1942, {{the campus}} became a War Information Center, one of 140 in the nation. The center was {{established}} to boost civilian morale and practice air raid drills. Rationing on campus of sugar, gas, soft drinks, and paper became common throughout the war. Classes were cut back due to the limited staff and the courses were shifted to <b>more</b> <b>scientific</b> and technological emphasis. The majority of the sports were canceled {{during the war and}} various drives were held to increase supplies sent to troops.|$|E
5|$|The first president, Joseph R. Williams, {{designed}} {{a curriculum that}} required <b>more</b> <b>scientific</b> study than practically any undergraduate institution of the era. It balanced science, liberal arts, and practical training. The curriculum excluded Latin and Greek studies since most applicants did not study any classical languages in their rural high schools. However, it did require three hours of daily manual labor, which kept costs down for both {{the students and the}} College. Despite Williams' innovations and his defense of education for the masses, the State Board of Education saw Williams' curriculum as elitist. They forced him to resign in 1859 and reduced the curriculum to a two-year vocational program.|$|E
5|$|The first section, {{entitled}} Definitions and Distinctions, {{consists of}} five chapters and details how Wellek and Warren define literature. This section also contrasts Wellek and Warren's definition {{with those of}} others, such views of literature as everything in print and as only belles-lettres (accepted literary canon). They define literary scholarship as beyond the personal ("super-personal") and contrasted with the literary arts by its <b>more</b> <b>scientific</b> approach. Wellek and Warren suggest that neither a purely objective nor a purely subjective approach {{would be able to}} properly describe literature. They note that literary scholarship should not only examine what makes a work or author unique, but also its general characteristics that allow it to be compared to other works.|$|E
50|$|Significance {{arithmetic}} are approximate {{rules for}} roughly maintaining significance throughout a computation. The <b>more</b> sophisticated <b>scientific</b> rules {{are known as}} propagation of uncertainty.|$|R

25|$|After Ruth's {{death and}} into the 1990s, some {{long-term}} students left over disagreements with Antares. These members wished to return focus to the original teachings of Ernest Norman and the <b>more</b> <b>scientific</b> aspects of Unarius. Some students disputed the importance of Uriel and prophecies concerning her.|$|E
25|$|The Morrill Act of 1862 {{provided}} land {{grants to}} states to begin colleges {{of agriculture and}} mechanical arts (engineering). Black colleges became eligible for these land grants in 1890. The Act succeeded in its goals to open new universities and make farming <b>more</b> <b>scientific</b> and profitable.|$|E
25|$|The Science & Environmental Satellites {{developed}} by Orbital perform scientific research, carry out deep space exploration (e.g. Dawn spacecraft, conduct remote sensing missions (e.g. Landsat 4, 5 and 8), and demonstrate new space technologies. In the last 10 years, Orbital has built <b>more</b> <b>scientific</b> and environmental monitoring satellites for NASA {{than any other}} company.|$|E

25|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century, antiquarians took an {{interest}} in these burials, and began excavating them, although <b>more</b> <b>scientific</b> excavation only began in the twentieth century with the development of archaeology. Prominent Anglo-Saxon burials that have since been discovered and excavated include the early cemetery of Spong Hill in Norfolk and the great sixth-seventh century ship burial of Sutton Hoo in Suffolk.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} {{mention of the}} term was in the {{writings}} of the 5th century BC Greek philosopher Anaxagoras. Panspermia began to assume a <b>more</b> <b>scientific</b> form through the proposals of Jöns Jacob Berzelius (1834), Hermann E. Richter (1865), Kelvin (1871), Hermann von Helmholtz (1879) and finally reaching the level of a detailed hypothesis through the efforts of the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius (1903).|$|E
25|$|This <b>more</b> <b>scientific</b> side of {{the hobby}} is an aspect of ornithology, coordinated in the UK by the British Trust for Ornithology. The Cornell Lab of Ornithology hosts many citizen-science {{projects}} to track the number and distribution of bird species across North America. These surveys help scientists note major changes {{from year to year}} which may occur as a result of climate change, disease, predation, and other factors.|$|E

25|$|In late December 1951, Ruppelt {{met with}} members of the Battelle Memorial Institute, a think tank based in Columbus, Ohio. Ruppelt wanted their experts to assist them in making the Air Force UFO study <b>more</b> <b>scientific.</b> It was the Battelle Institute that devised the {{standardized}} reporting form. Starting in late March 1952, the Institute started analyzing existing sighting reports and encoding about 30 report characteristics onto IBM punched cards for computer analysis.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} note on {{the growth}} of hydropathy is that it started to become prominent as traditional medical practice was becoming more professional {{in terms of how}} doctors operated, alienating many patients, as they felt that the medical encounter was becoming less personalized, and the <b>more</b> <b>scientific</b> the medical language became, the less that they could easily understand. Hydropathy was a return to a treatment that was spiritual and natural, making it more palatable to those who felt uncomfortable with the direction that traditional medicine was taking.|$|E
25|$|As the {{software}} domain evolves and software technology surges, developers face significant challenges {{in meeting the}} requirements of these large complex systems of systems. DACS currently is engaged in some initiatives to provide the developers greater insight about software best practice and about improving their development process. Concurrently DACS is participating, {{along with the other}} IACs, in supporting a DTIC initiative to make <b>more</b> <b>scientific</b> and technical information available to the warfighter in electronic form. These initiatives are described in greater detail in the following sub-sections.|$|E

25|$|Authorities of Lagos State have {{attacked}} {{the results of}} the 2006 census, accusing the Nigerian National Population Commission of having undercounted the population of the state. This accusation is denied by the National Population Commission. A study found that research carried out by Africapolis (the African subsidiary of e-Geopolis backed by the Agence française de développement), in addition to the cross-referencing of official figures with <b>more</b> <b>scientific</b> independent research concluded that the 2006 census figures for Lagos State of about 9 million were valid and that the state's own assessments are inflated.|$|E
25|$|Back in Chicago, Merriam coordinated {{and edited}} {{a series of}} {{comparative}} studies by political scientists {{on the use of}} expertise in policy making, civic education, and public opinion. Merriam's contribution to the series, The Making of Citizens (1934), was highly laudatory of Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, and Fascist Italy's use of these tools to strengthen the sense of national purpose and achieve policy goals. Merriam was highly critical of these regimes, though, and felt that a <b>more</b> <b>scientific</b> approach would avoid the messianism on which these governments relied and strengthen democratic and pluralistic norms.|$|E
25|$|The Fra Mauro world map {{is a major}} cartographical work. It {{took several}} years to {{complete}} and was very expensive to produce. The map contains hundreds of detailed illustrations and more than 3000 descriptive texts. It was the most detailed and accurate representation {{of the world that}} had been produced up until that time. As such, the Fra Mauro map {{is considered one of the}} most important works in the history of cartography. It marks the end of Bible-based geography in Europe and the beginning of embracing a <b>more</b> <b>scientific</b> way of making maps, placing accuracy ahead of religious or traditional beliefs.|$|E
