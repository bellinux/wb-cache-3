40|$|Information {{fusion of}} multi-{{biometrics}} {{has become a}} center of focus for biometrics based identification and verification, {{and there are two}} fusion categories: intra-modal fusion and multi-modal fusion. In this paper, an intra-modal fusion, that is, <b>multi-parts</b> and multi-feature fusion (MPMFF) for face verification is studied. Two face representations are exploited, including the gray-level intensity feature and Gabor feature. Different from most face recognition methods, the MPMFF method divides a face image into five parts: bare face, eyebrows, eyes, nose and mouth, and different features of the same face part are fused at feature level. Then at decision level, five matching results based on the combined-features of different parts are calculated into a final similar score according to the weighted sum rule. Experiment results on FERET face database and our own face database show that the <b>multi-parts</b> and multi-feature fusion method improves the face verification performance. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper we {{describe}} the CAGD {{part of an effort}} that aimed at the unifi-cation of the whole geometric preprocessing that preceded the wind tunnel readings with a realistic air-plane wing model in a recent research project. This preprocessing includes the automated gener-ation of the CAD models which were used for the manufacturing of the <b>multi-parted</b> wing-fuselage configuration and the generation of the numerical grids for the corresponding numerical simulations. Due to the constraints of the project it was decided to employ only exact, watertight, untrimmed B-Spline representations. From this process we describe the methods and algorithms for automated generation of <b>multi-parted</b> airplane wings from one or more cross-sections given by point clouds and the top view of the wing. A rounded wing tip an several types of winglets can be added. Fur-thermore we can compute and add fuselages to achieve realistic results near the root of the airfoil wing...|$|R

5|$|Most of {{the early}} stories were {{completed}} in one issue, but <b>multi-part</b> stories began to appear {{by the middle of}} the series' first year of publication, and there were hints of the ongoing storylines that would later characterize the series. In May 1983, issue #11 introduced many new characters, including most of the 1983 action figure line and the villain Destro, who would become a frequently recurring character. Many subsequent storylines involved the machinations and power struggles between him, Cobra Commander, and the Baroness.

40|$|FDM is one {{of popular}} rapid {{prototyping}} methods. Build orientation of an object using FDM is usually determined by the object's structure after considering build feasibility, build efficiency, and build accuracy. In this paper, a novel object build orientation selection method in FDM is proposed based on the tensile strain of an object to be built. Test specimens with different build orientations are built with FDM to investigate the relationship between build orientation and allowed maximum tensile strain through tensile test experiments. Based on the relationship, golden section search is employed to determine the build orientation of an object consisting of <b>multi-parts</b> {{in order to get}} allowed maximum tensile strain. The build orientation of a truss is determined with the proposed method to verify its feasibility and reliability with satisfied results. Â© 2010 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{particle}} behaviour in a heat treatment fluidised bed was studied by {{the analysis of}} particle images taken with a high speed CCD digital video camera. The comparison of particle dynamics was performed for the fluidised beds without part, with single part and with <b>multi-parts.</b> The results show that there are significant differences in {{particle behaviour}}s both in different beds and at different locations of part surfaces. The total and radiative heat transfer coefficients at different surfaces of a metallic part in a fluidised bed were measured by a heat transfer probe developed in the present work. The structure of the probe was optimized with numerical simulation of energy conservation for measuring the heat transfer coefficient of 150 - 600 W/m 2 K. The relationship between the particle dynamics and the heat transfer was analysed to {{form the basis for}} future more rational designs of fluidised beds as well as for improved quality control...|$|R

25|$|African-American {{music is}} rooted in the {{typically}} polyrhythmic music of the ethnic groups of Africa, specifically those in the Western, Sahelean, and Sub-Saharan regions. African oral traditions, nurtured in slavery, encouraged the use of music to pass on history, teach lessons, ease suffering, and relay messages. The African pedigree of African-American music is evident in some common elements: call and response, syncopation, percussion, improvisation, swung notes, blue notes, the use of falsetto, melisma, and complex <b>multi-part</b> harmony.

30|$|Most {{proposed}} tracking methods rely {{on global}} appearance features. However, occlusion or deformation may dramatically deteriorate {{the performance of}} such methods. Recently, the part-based tracker has attracted researchersâ attention. The part-based tracking methods divide the target into multiple parts and then use the generative tracker or discriminative tracker to track parts of the target. Most part-based trackers retain the structural layout of the target. For example, Yao et al. [11] propose a part-based appearance model that utilizes the spatial structure of parts to predict new position of the target by minimizing the appearance and deformation costs. Liu et al. [12] propose an oversaturated part-based tracking algorithm based on spatio-temporal context learning, which includes a structural layout constraint and a model updating strategy. Gao et al. [13] propose an end-to-end deep regression model utilizing the advantages of convolutional neural networks, which fully exploits the context information of the parts to preserve the spatial layout structure of the target, and learns {{the reliability of the}} parts to emphasize the importance of the parts. Liu et al. [14] propose a structural correlation filter SCF that preserves the overall structure of the target through maintaining similar circular shifts for all parts. With comprehensive progress of tracking algorithms, many part-based tracking methods absorb the ideas from different methods. Bhargava et al. [15] propose a <b>multi-parts</b> and multi-feature tracking method, exploiting strong features to measure the confidence and reducing the impact of weak features. Niu et al. [16] introduce a background tracker to typical part-based framework, which aims to determine the occurrence of occlusion, so as to adjust the update strategy of the target tracker. Additionally, Wang et al. [17] creatively introduce the imagery ranking-based method into the field of part-based tracking. Li et al. [18] combine the idea of particle filter with correlation filter. Liu et al. [19] take advantage of correlation filter and Bayesian inference and propose a tracker for real-time component tracking. Recently, Johnander et al. [20] propose a deformable filter which is represented as a linear combination of sub-filters, and establish a unified formulation to learn a deformable convolution filter.|$|R
40|$|DissertationIn this study, {{inventory}} {{systems for}} repairable-parts with service level consideration are studied. The first study develops a <b>multi-parts</b> inventory system and transportation decisions. A failed part might be repairable at the stock location, or at repair facilities, {{or it might}} be non repairable, which should be replaced by a new purchased part. The objective is to find the base stock levels and shipping modes that maximizes the total weighted fill rate within a given budget. An optimization model and the properties of the objective function are developed. An approximation method is used to eliminate the highly non-linearity of the objective function, and the optimality of approximated model is discussed under specific conditions. The results of numerical experiments show the benefits of alternative transportation mode. Failure rates are observed to be the most significant factor in determining the assigned base stock level and shipping mode. A two-echelon repairable-parts inventory system is considered in the second study, where emergency purchasing and ordering from the central warehouse are allowed to obtain high service level. A dynamic decision making model is developed that minimizes the system's operational costs, including transportation, stocking and purchasing new parts during the contract period, and provides the required service level over the contract period. The numerical experiments show the benefits of purchasing and ordering options in systems with high penalty costs and long repair times, especially where the allocated inventory to the stock location is not enough to guarantee the target service level. Our model also provides the best base stock levels that minimize the operational costs and initial investments at the stock location. In the previous studies, we assumed that the contractual terms are given to the supplier and are considered as fixed parameters. The main focus in the last study is providing the contractual terms to the supplier that prompts him to provide a better service performance. The decision maker in this system is the customer, and he requires a minimum service level from the supplier. The customer is willing to grant the supplier for a better service performance by providing incentives. The objective is to find the terms of contract, the fixed payment, incentives and contract duration, that maximize the service provided by the supplier during the planning horizon under a constrained budget. We first develop a mixed integer programming model assuming the information on the supplier's cost and service is visible to the customer. Then, we extend our model to a robust model in which the uncertainty of information is included...|$|R
