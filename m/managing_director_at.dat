5|$|As {{part of the}} 1985 and 1987 {{agreements}} with the Parliament of Norway ahead of the 1994 Winter Olympics bid, Lillehammer Municipality was responsible for financing and building all Olympic venues and associated facilities. To fulfill their obligation, the municipality established Lillehammer Olympiske Anlegg (LOA) in 1989. Mr. Haavind was hired as the company's first <b>managing</b> <b>director.</b> <b>At</b> {{the same time the}} Post-Olympics Use Committee was established to ensure activity at the venues after the Olympics.

5|$|The {{company was}} bought by BSA in 1961 {{at a cost of}} £8.5million and became known in legal terms as BSA-Churchill Machine Tools Ltd. In October 1962 H G Sturgeon, OBE, {{previously}} <b>managing</b> <b>director</b> <b>at</b> de Havilland Aircraft, was appointed to the same position at Churchill; he moved on in 1964 to become managing director of the BSA group's Motorcycle division. In 1966 Churchill merged in a joint-venture agreement with Alfred Herbert and became part of Herbert-BSA Ltd, the intention being that the combined concerns would gain benefits from rationalisation and symbiosis of their activities. The general expectation – held also by the Department of Trade and Industry and the stock market – of rewards from the venture did not materialise and BSA sold its entire holding in August 1971, writing off £6.9M {{as a consequence of the}} need to have cash in hand to address issues elsewhere in its activities.|$|E

25|$|The major {{competitor}} for the Panorama Elite III was the Duple Dominant launched at the 1972 Commercial Motor Show in London.

The Dominant sold well but never caught up with the Elite. The mere fact that at the 1972 Commercial Motor Show only one Dominant was available due to a long strike at the Blackpool factory couldn't have helped much. The launch of the Dominant was at Lake Garda in Italy and was Duple's most important launch for years.|$|E
