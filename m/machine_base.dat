25|$|The {{most common}} type of forging {{equipment}} is the hammer and anvil. Principles behind the hammer and anvil are still used today in drop-hammer equipment. The principle behind the machine is simple: raise the hammer and drop it or propel it into the workpiece, which rests on the anvil. The main variations between drop-hammers are in the way the hammer is powered; the most common being air and steam hammers. Drop-hammers usually operate in a vertical position. The main reason for this is excess energy (energy that isn't used to deform the workpiece) that isn't released as heat or sound needs to be transmitted to the foundation. Moreover, a large <b>machine</b> <b>base</b> is needed to absorb the impacts.|$|E

In a counterblow machine both the hammer and anvil move and the workpiece is held between them. Here excess energy becomes recoil. This allows for the machine to work horizontally and consist of a smaller base. Other advantages include less noise, heat and vibrations. It also produces a distinctly different flow pattern. Both of these machines can be used for open die or closed die forging. A forging press, often just called a press, is used for press forging.|$|E

The entire magnet system is enclosed between the Outer Vessel and the plasma vessel in high vacuum at 4 K. The coils are supported by a support structure, the Central Support Structure (CSS). The CSS carries all 70 coils, and it is designed as a closed ring made of 5 modules (10 half mod-ules).

For the realisation of high stiffness and good damping characteristics hydrostatic guideways are used. However, the dominated feature of the linear axis is the design of a mass decoupling system that allows the reduction of the prefaced <b>machine</b> <b>base</b> forces of more than 60 %. With this, a very high dynamic and also precise movement can be realised. The developed axis allows the machining of planar groove structures by planing faster than fly-cutting, with the same lateral straightness quality and surface roughness...|$|E

Its {{ultimate goal is}} to verify that such stellarator magnetic confinement concept is a viable option for a demonstration fusion power-plant. Its toroidal plasma (major diameter of 11 m) is enclosed by a cryostat. The Outer Vessel (OV), ports and the Vacuum Vessel (VV) accumulate the cryostst together. The main functions of the VV supports (VVS) are to withstand and transfer all vertical forces from the VV to the <b>machine</b> <b>base</b> and to allow horizontal movements simultaneously.

40|$|Instrumentation {{and control}} (I&C) systems {{play a crucial}} role in the {{operation}} of nuclear power plants and other safety critical processes. An important change that will be going on in the near future is the replacement of the old analogue I&C systems by new digitalised ones. The programmable digital logic controllers enable more complicated control tasks than the old analogue systems and thus the verification of the control logic designs against safety requirements has become more important. In order to diminish the subjective component of the evaluation, there is a need to develop new formal verification methods.

40|$|Press-in Piling {{technology}} has been introduced to solve the challenges faced by piling contractors during pile driving operation in soft soil. Press-in Piling machine, so called the “Silent Piler” operates based on reaction principle where the machine grips on previous installed piles during piling operation. This allows the press-in machine to work and travel firmly along the pile top, eliminating the risk of machine overturning due to soft <b>machine</b> <b>base.</b> In 1982, Giken Reaction Base (GRB) System has been introduced, allowing more supporting machineries such as the “Power Pack” of Silent Piler, the „Clamp Crane‟ and the „Pile Runner‟ to sit firmly and work on top of installed piles. With such arrangement of equipment, the entire piling procedures such as pile transportation, pile pitching and press-in piling work can be synchronized systematically. This changes the construction approach, making non-staging piling work possible in sensitive areas, difficult slope embankment, soft soil and marine condition, resulting in faster, easier and safer construction...|$|E
