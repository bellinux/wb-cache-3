40|$|International audienceSeveral {{thousands}} {{electrical connections}} are necessary in airplanes. Electrical cables are joined to contacts using <b>manual</b> <b>crimping</b> devices in industrial plants. When mechanical defects appear, {{the replacement of}} the defective connections has to be made directly on the airplane. This operation is difficult and time-consuming due to reduced accessibility, making it very costly. The aim {{of this paper is to}} simulate the crimping operation and then evaluate the mechanical strength of the obtained connection in order to identify, understand and eliminate defects due to unsatisfactory crimping operations. Material behavior data is accessed through mechanical testing performed on cables and contact; accurate material data is mandatory to improve the accuracy of the simulation results. The Forge® software is used to perform the numerical simulation to predict the stress and strain distribution as well as the crimping force during crimping operations. Resulting mechanical strength of the joint is also analysed using numerical simulation. Experimental and numerical results are then compared...|$|E
40|$|Compared to {{traditional}} stapes prostheses, self-crimping prostheses {{have been shown}} to result in similar, if not better, closure of the air bone gap in patients undergoing stapedotomy for otosclerosis. To achieve self-crimping, nitinol, a shape memory alloy, has been used for several years but concerns have been raised regarding possible damage to the incus and its muco-periosteum. We investigate these concerns with regard to the newer NiTiBOND stapes prosthesis in an observational multi-centre study. In a multicentre, prospective observational study, 76 patients undergoing stapedotomy with the NiTiBond prosthesis across 4 centres were compared to 75 -retrospectively selected control SMart patients. Complications, intra-operative user-friendliness and audiological results at 3 months were documented. Audiological improvement and the rate of complications were similar in both groups. Non inferiority was shown at all frequencies and in the pure-tone average. The NiTiBOND prosthesis was described as very user-friendly. By eliminating <b>manual</b> <b>crimping,</b> stapedotomy using the NiTiBOND prosthesis can be facilitated and standardized. Furthermore, intraoperative handling characteristics of the prosthesis are very good which may further reduce operative risk. Importantly, we show that these benefits are not to the detriment of audiological outcome. Larger and longer-term studies are required to further evaluate results...|$|E
50|$|Within {{hand tools}} there are manual and {{automatic}} tools. <b>Manual</b> tensioners and <b>crimping</b> systems {{are available for}} low volume applications. Automatic hand tools are used for higher volume applications. Automatic tools are available using a battery power source or compressed air. Both manual and automatic tools are available as combination tools, which perform the tensioning, sealing and cutting, or as separate tensioners, sealers, and cutters. Manual sealers for plastic strap always use a seal and a compression (serrated seals) or crimp joint (smooth faced seals). Manual and automatic hand sealers for steel can use a seal or a seal-less joint. Automatic hand tools for plastic strap use a friction weld.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} crimping techniques in stapes surgery for otosclerosis patients measured by hearing outcomes on pure-tone audiometry. DATA SOURCES PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. METHODS A systematic search was conducted. Studies comparing the effect of different crimping methods on pure-tone audiometric results in patients undergoing stapes surgery for otosclerosis were included. Relevance and risk of bias were assessed. Absolute risks and risk differences, means and mean differences, and 95 % confidence intervals were extracted or calculated for the primary and secondary outcomes, which were air-bone gap closure to 10 dB or less, mean postoperative air-bone gap, and postoperative sensorineural hearing loss. RESULTS Twenty-two studies with moderate or high risk of bias were included for data extraction. Air-bone gap closure to 10 dB or less was assessed in 17 studies and mean postoperative air-bone gap in 20 studies. The hearing outcomes did not consistently favor one crimping method. However, the differences that were statistically significant were consistently in favor of heat crimping over manual and no crimping (difference in air-bone gap closure to 10 dB or less ranged between 22 % and 42 % in these studies and difference in mean postoperative air-bone gap between 2. 8 dB and 7. 4 dB) and in favor of <b>manual</b> <b>crimping</b> over no crimping (30 % difference in air-bone gap closure to 10 dB or less and difference in mean postoperative air-bone gap between 2. 6 dB and 6. 0 dB). CONCLUSION Moderate to high risk of bias and inconsistent results characterize the current evidence...|$|E
40|$|HYPOTHESIS: Tight {{fixation}} of stapes prostheses yields better functional results because {{sound transmission}} from the incus to the prosthesis is improved. BACKGROUND: The optimal prosthesis {{to use for}} otosclerosis surgery is still a matter of debate. It has been proposed that using prostheses made of Nitinol, a shape-memory metal, produces better functional results with less variability and reduced risk for middle and inner ear damage. This {{is thought to be}} because heat activation rather than <b>manual</b> <b>crimping</b> of the prosthesis loop forms a tighter fixation. METHODS: Functional results of two groups were compared 1 year after surgery. In one group were 75 cases of stapedotomy performed using Nitinol prostheses. Results were analyzed prospectively and compared with 75 retrospectively analyzed matched controls with conventional stapes prostheses. Crimping quality was measured in 23 patients by intraoperative laser Doppler interferometry (LDI). Causality was assessed by correlating results of intraoperative LDI and postoperative pure-tone thresholds. RESULTS: Nitinol and conventional prostheses yielded postoperative air-bone gaps (ABGs) of 8. 0 and 11. 6 dB with 71 and 43 % ABG closure within 10 dB, respectively. Intraoperatively, sound transmission was improved by 2. 5 dB with the Nitinol prostheses as compared with conventional prostheses. These differences were statistically significant. Intraoperative fixation quality was positively correlated to functional outcome, but results were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Tight fixation, as provided by Nitinol prostheses leads to improved functional results because of better sound transmission properties at the incus-prosthesis interface. The improvement in ABG closure is in the range of 3 dB pure-tone average and more pronounced at higher frequencies. Nitinol prostheses provide an effective treatment option in otosclerosis surgery...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Use of the SMart piston, a nitinol-based, self-crimping {{prosthesis}} in {{stapes surgery}} may allow improved functional results because of better sound transmission properties at the incus-prosthesis interface {{because of the}} elimination of <b>manual</b> <b>crimping.</b> Possible disadvantages include thermal damage or strangulation of the incus and its mucoperiosteum or nickel intolerance. The goal {{of this study was}} to morphologically assess the fixation of this prosthesis to the incus, investigate the reaction of the middle ear mucosa to the prosthesis, identify alterations to the incudal bone, and detect deposits of nickel in the tissue around the prosthesis. STUDY DESIGN:: Prospective consecutive case analysis. SETTING:: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Four patients with an unfavorable functional result after primary SMart-piston stapedotomy. INTERVENTION: Revision malleostapedotomy with explantation of the incus and prosthesis for further analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Analysis of intraoperative findings and postoperative examination of the explants using light- and scanning-electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray analysis, and atom absorption spectrometry. RESULTS:: The intraoperative, macroscopic, and scanning electron microscopic investigation showed tight circular fixation of the prostheses, whereas a gap between the prosthesis and the lateral incus was found in 1 case. All prostheses were overgrown by mucosa. Superficial localized erosion of the incudal bone was found in 2 cases. There was no elevation in nickel content in the removed tissue samples. CONCLUSION:: The lateral gap between prosthesis and incus did not affect fixation of the prosthesis, neither did covering by a mucosal layer. Bone erosion was most likely caused by laser in one and by the prosthesis in another explant. No signs of increased nickel deposits could be found on energy dispersive x-ray analysis or atom absorption spectrometry. We conclude that a nitinol stapes prosthesis is safe for treatment of stapedial fixation...|$|E
