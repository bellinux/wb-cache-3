50|$|The most {{practical}} sensor for measuring temperature change in titrating solutions {{has been found}} to be the thermistor. Thermistors are small solid state devices which exhibit relatively large changes in electrical resistance for small changes in temperature. They are manufactured from sintered <b>mixed</b> <b>metal</b> <b>oxides,</b> with lead wires enabling connection to electrical circuitry. The thermistor is encapsulated in a suitable electrically insulating medium with satisfactory heat transfer characteristics and acceptable chemical resistance. Typically for thermistors used for chemical analysis the encapsulating medium is glass, although thermistors encapsulated in epoxy resin may be used in circumstances where either chemical attack (e.g., by acidic fluoride-containing solutions) or severe mechanical stress is anticipated. The thermistor is supported by suitable electronic circuitry to maximize sensitivity to minute changes in solution temperature. The circuitry in the Metrohm 859 Titrotherm thermometric titration interface moldule is capable of resolving temperature changes as low as 10−5 K.|$|E

30|$|The {{suitability}} of catalyst type {{depends on the}} isomerization process temperature. For example, the Pt-chlorinated alumina is the most active catalyst for isomerization, and they are operated at lower temperatures (20 – 130  °C). The <b>mixed</b> <b>metal</b> <b>oxide</b> catalysts are less reactive than Pt-chlorinated alumina base catalyst, so they are operated at a relatively higher temperature (around 150  °C) [6, 7, 8]. The chlorinated alumina catalysts produce compounds with higher octane number. However, the chlorinated Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalyst requires a promoter to enhance its activity [10]. These catalysts are highly susceptible to contamination during their use {{and can lead to}} catalyst poisoning. Therefore, the feedstock is required to be preheated to obtain the required products [1, 8, 9]. Several studies have been carried out with varying amount of different metal content in the catalyst and the experimental results showed that Ni–Pt <b>mixed</b> <b>metal</b> <b>oxide</b> (0.2 % Pt and 0.4 % Ni) showed lesser activity and yield of n-paraffin than Pd–Pt (0.2 % Pt and 0.4 % Pd) <b>mixed</b> <b>metal</b> <b>oxide</b> catalyst [8, 9, 10].|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Process Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. The {{synthesis}} of <b>mixed</b> <b>metal</b> <b>oxides,</b> specifically {{the need and}} ability to successfully and accurately control the particle size, their stability and the reactivity of these nanoparticles is required, so as to allow the attachment of catalyst nanoparticle {{to the surface of}} a substrate or to other particles without leading to coalescence of the catalyst particle and hence to loss of their size induced properties. However, the {{synthesis of}} <b>mixed</b> <b>metal</b> <b>oxides</b> is a complex problem. Though various methods of preparing these types of oxides have been reported and applied, such methods they rarely produced pure forms and have often been recorded as having been contaminated with other phases. Often the particle sizes are too large in the micrometer range, and the size distribution is overly wide. Moreover, even if particles of nanometer size are formed, they tend to aggregate or agglomerate. In the current research, microemulsions were used to synthesize the nanoparticles. Such microemulsion consists of water droplets encapsulated by surfactant molecules in a pool of oil, comprising: water in oil (w/o) or reverse micelles. Reverse micelles in the nanometer size range are thermodynamically stable and optically transparent in the solution. They are believed to be highly dynamic structures whose components rearrange themselves over time and space through interaction or collision, coalescing and redispersing. However, the advantage of this method over using the standard method is that the particle size can largely be controlled, and a narrow size distribution obtained. The aim of the research was to investigate the feasibility of using the reverse micelle technique for the synthesis of <b>mixed</b> <b>metal</b> <b>oxides</b> - specifically α-bismuth molybdate (α- Bi 2 Mo 3 O 12) with a controlled and desirable particle size and a narrow size distribution [...] ...|$|E
