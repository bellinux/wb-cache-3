2500|$|Ngezi Forest Reserve covers {{an area of}} [...] {{and is in the}} {{north-western}} tip of Pemba Island. It {{was declared}} a reserve in 1950 after most of the area had been denuded for cultivation of cloves. It still has high closed forests known as Ngezi forest extending right up to the beach at Vumawimbi. The forest types reported consist of coral bushes and thickets, thick grasses and bushes in the sandy-loam soils and Mtifutifu soils; dominant plant species are: Odyendea zimmermanni (Mjoho), riverine forest of Barringtonia racemosa (Mtomondo), Milicia spp (Mvule), Alexandrian laurel (Mtondoo), Erythropholem spp (Mwavi), Antiarus spp (Mgulele), Chrisalidocarpus pembanus (Mpapindi) and Terminalia catapa (Mkungu), and mangrove forests. Avifauna recorded consists of 27 bird species in the forests, out of which the endemic species are hadada, the African goshawk, the palm-nut vulture, scops owl, the <b>malachite</b> <b>kingfisher</b> and the Pemba white-eye. Other faunal species consist of Pemba flying fox (large fruit-eating bat), the Pemba vervet monkey, the Zanzibar red colobus monkey, hyrax, Pemba blue duiker (an antelope {{about the size of a}} hare), feral pigs (introduced by the Portuguese), the Javan civet cat (introduced by southeast Asian traders for the production of musk) and marsh mongoose (an endemic carnivore).|$|E

40|$|Several {{species of}} {{kingfisher}} occur on Lake Nokoué, southern Bénin, including Malachite (Alcedo cristata) and Pied Kingfishers (Ceryle rudis). Here, we compare their diet and estimate {{the degree of}} overlap in food niche by analysing contents of regurgitated pellets collected near nesting sites of Pied Kingfishers or inside the nest chambers of <b>Malachite</b> <b>Kingfishers.</b> Characteristic fish skull bones were identified using a reference collection of local fish skeletons. <b>Malachite</b> <b>Kingfishers</b> feed most frequently on fish that occur around floating vegetation, mainly Kribia sp. (56 %), Hemichromis fasciatus (28 %) and Sarotherodon melanotheron (8 %). Important {{differences were found between}} different pairs, and between adults and nestlings, the latter being fed almost exclusively on Kribia sp. Larger fish are fed to nestlings than are eaten by the adults. Pied Kingfishers prey upon 14 different fish species, some of them being caught in the pelagic region of the lake, particularly clupeids taken by hovering. By comparison with <b>Malachite</b> <b>Kingfishers,</b> Pied Kingfishers feed on a wider diversity of prey, and take larger fish, so that the dietary overlap between the species is relatively low (O = 0. 181).

50|$|A {{molecular}} phylogenetic {{study published}} in 2007 confirmed that the most closely related species is the Malagasy kingfisher, (Corythornis vintsioides). The Malagasy kingfisher has a black bill and greenish crest, and {{is not quite as}} dependent on water as the African species. It is otherwise similar in plumage and behaviour to the more widespread <b>malachite</b> <b>kingfisher.</b> The São Tomé kingfisher and the Príncipe kingfisher were sometimes considered as distinct species but a {{study published in}} 2008 showed that they are both subspecies of the <b>malachite</b> <b>kingfisher.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>malachite</b> <b>{{kingfisher}}</b> (Corythornis cristatus) is a {{river kingfisher}} which is widely distributed in Africa {{south of the}} Sahara. It is largely resident except for seasonal climate-related movements.|$|E
50|$|A dam on {{the reserve}} plays host to many wetland birds {{including}} little bittern, knob-billed duck, black stork, woolly-necked stork, egyptian geese, white-faced whistling duck and <b>Malachite</b> <b>kingfisher</b> amongst others.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of bird species around the lake. These include African fish eagles (Haliaeetus vocifer), <b>malachite</b> <b>kingfishers</b> (Alcedo cristata), pied kingfishers (Ceryle rudis), swamp flycatchers (Muscicapa aquatica), village weavers (Ploceus cucullatus), [...] {{speckled}} mousebirds (Colius striatus), black-lored (Turdoides melanops) and arrow-marked (T. jardineii) babblers, African paradise-flycatchers (Terpsiphone viridis), scarlet-chested (Nectarinia senegalensis), bronze (N. kilimensis) and green-headed (N. verticalis) sunbirds, yellow-fronted canaries (Serinus mozambicus), green-winged pytilias (Pytilia melba), great (Phalacrocorax carbo) and white-breasted (P. lucidus) cormorants, openbill (Anastomus lamelligerus) and yellow-billed (Mycteria ibis) storks and cattle egrets (Bubulcus ibis). There is also a pair of semi-domesticated grey crowned cranes (Balearica regulorum) at the Jambo Beach resort in Gahini.|$|R
50|$|Among the {{colourful}} {{family of}} kingfishers, which preferably occur near open water, the woodland kingfisher, pied kingfisher (Ceryle rudis), swallow-tailed bee-eater (Merops hirundineus), giant kingfisher (Ceryle maxima), <b>malachite</b> <b>kingfisher</b> (Alcedo cristata) and the blue-breasted kingfisher (Halcyon malimbica) are notable.|$|E
50|$|The {{subfamily}} includes 35 species {{divided into}} four genera. The African dwarf kingfisher is sometimes placed in the monotypic genus Myioceyx, and sometimes with the pygmy kingfishers in Ispidina. Molecular analysis suggests that the Madagascan pygmy kingfisher is most {{closely related to the}} <b>malachite</b> <b>kingfisher.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The African pygmy {{kingfisher}} is [...] in length. The sexes are alike. It {{is very small}} kingfisher with rufous underparts and a blue back extending down to the tail. The dark blue crown of the adult separates it from the African dwarf kingfisher. The smaller size and violet wash on the ear coverts distinguish it from the similar <b>malachite</b> <b>kingfisher.</b>|$|E
50|$|KingfishersThe kingfishers {{are famous}} as hunters of fish, {{but not all}} species hunt fish or over water. Indeed, some hunt away from water, such as the brown-hooded kingfisher, which is a {{woodland}} species that hunts large insects and small vertebrates. Some South African species are among the largest of their kind, such as the giant kingfisher and the pied kingfisher. Others are the smallest, such as the <b>malachite</b> <b>kingfisher.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The São Tomé {{kingfisher}} (Corythornus cristatus thomensis) is {{a bird in}} {{the family}} Alcedinidae. It is endemic to São Tomé, an island off {{the west coast of}} Africa in the Gulf of Guinea and was first described by the Italian ornithologist Tommaso Salvadori in 1902 under the binomial name Corythornis thomensis. [...] A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2008 showed that the São Tomé kingfisher is a subspecies of the <b>malachite</b> <b>kingfisher.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>malachite</b> <b>kingfisher</b> was {{described}} by the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas in 1764 and given the binomial name Alcedo cristata. The specific epithet cristata is from the Latin cristatus meaning [...] "crested" [...] or [...] "plumed". The adjective [...] "malachite" [...] in the vernacular name normally refers to the dark green colour of the copper containing mineral. This kingfisher has blue upperparts but has black banding with pale blue or greenish-blue on its forehead.|$|E
50|$|The Príncipe {{kingfisher}} (Corythornis cristatus nais) is {{a bird in}} {{the family}} Alcedinidae. It is endemic to the island of Príncipe off {{the west coast of}} Africa in the Gulf of Guinea. The first formal description of the species was by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1848 who gave it the binomial name Alcedo nais. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2008 showed that the Príncipe kingfisher is a subspecies of the <b>malachite</b> <b>kingfisher.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{mangroves}} are {{an important}} habitat {{for a variety of}} wildlife from fish crustaceans and molluscs in the waters to snakes and monkeys such as Sykes' monkey in the trees and animals including antelopes, elephants and African buffalo who come to graze on the fringes of the swamps. Larger animals that feed in the swamp waters include hippopotamus, green turtle (Chelonia mydas), hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), and olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea) turtles, porpoises and important populations of the endangered dugong. Located alongside coral reefs, these mangroves are sheltered by the coral from ocean tides and storms, and the swamps provide food for the many fish, shrimps and other marine fauna that shelter in the coral. The swamps are also important feeding grounds for large numbers of migratory birds such as curlew sandpiper (Calidris ferruginea), little stint (Calidris minuta) and Caspian tern (Hydroprogne caspia), waterbirds such as crab-plover (Dromas ardeola), yellow-billed stork and <b>malachite</b> <b>kingfisher,</b> and seabirds such as roseate tern (Sterna dougallii).|$|E

40|$|From 2004 to 2009, 127 nests of the <b>Malachite</b> <b>Kingfisher</b> Alcedo cristata were {{monitored}} in the Kinshasa region (Democratic Republic of Congo) {{by counting}} eggs and ringing chicks and adults. In total, 195 birds (57 adults and 138 fledglings) were ringed, of which all adults and 121 chicks were weighed and measured. The <b>Malachite</b> <b>Kingfisher</b> lays 2 – 4 eggs that are incubated 15 – 16 {{days in the}} burrow. The nestling period is 16 – 17 days. Chick metabolic and ecological demands may explain the pattern of growth of the nestlings...|$|E
40|$|From 2004 to 2009, two {{colonies of}} <b>Malachite</b> <b>Kingfisher</b> were {{monitored}} by ringing the nestlings and adults, counting eggs and observing parental {{activity at the}} nests. Results show that 10 % of nests were destroyed by people in the Symphonies site as against 78 % in the Monastery site. Consequently, the number of nests available for breeding is lower at Monastery than at Symphonies. The number of fledged chicks per nest at Symphonies was twice that at the Monastery. Site fidelity is higher for the adults in the Symphonies site (26 %) than at the Monastery (11 %). This suggests that the Monastery site is less favourable {{to the survival of}} the <b>Malachite</b> <b>Kingfisher</b> than the Symphonies site. The best strategy to protect this species seems to be the maintenance of a good number of nesting sites...|$|E
40|$|The first granulometrical {{analysis}} of soil samples from nesting {{banks of the}} <b>Malachite</b> <b>Kingfisher</b> Alcedo cristata is reported. In total 56 samples from the Kinshasa area were analysed. Three standardised particle size fractions were determined in all groups of samples (percentage of sand, clay and silt). Mean particle percentage of soil samples from banks occupied by Malachite Kingfishers averaged 10. 8 ± 6. 1 of silt, 11. 6 ± 6. 5 of clay and 81. 4 ± 11. 4 of sand. A {{significant difference was found}} in the proportion of clay between banks with and without kingfisher nests. The {{results of the present study}} hence suggest that, as has been documented in other burrowing bird species, soil texture determines the selection of nesting sites in the <b>Malachite</b> <b>Kingfisher.</b> Our results indicate that even a slight difference in the proportion of clay can substantially affect the suitability of banks for the establishment of nests. In fact, burrowing birds must find suitable soils whose structure allows for a good compromise between stability and hardness to dig out, which poses an energy challenge just before the breeding season...|$|E
40|$|The diet of the <b>Malachite</b> <b>Kingfisher</b> was {{investigated}} by study of 182 regurgitated pellets collected from 65 broods during the nesting {{period in the}} rainy seasons from 2004 to 2009, in two sites in the Kinshasa area. In total, 2619 undigested remains were identified in the pellets, revealing 1100 prey. The Malachite Kingfisher’s diet is rich and diverse. The prey identified were 92. 7 % fishes (Oreochromis niloticus, Gambusia affinis and Hemichromis elongatus), 5. 9 % insects (Odonata and Orthoptera) and 0. 5 % frogs...|$|E
