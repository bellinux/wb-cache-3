When Nat King Cole's television show was unable to get a sponsor, Laine crossed the color line, becoming the first white artist to appear as a guest (forgoing his usual salary of $10,000.00 as Cole's show only paid scale). Many other top white singers followed suit, including Tony Bennett and Rosemary Clooney, but Cole's show still could not get enough sponsors to continue.|$|E

This eliminated the need for northbound trains to skip 45th Street and 53rd Street as R trains no longer needed to relay on the express tracks at 36th Street.
