40|$|We {{report the}} {{identification}} of a new simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), designated SIVden, in a naturally infected Dent's Mona monkey (Cercopithecus mona denti), which was kept as pet in Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo. SIVden is genetically distinct from the previously characterized primate lentiviruses. Analysis of the full-length genomic sequence revealed {{the presence of a}} vpu open reading frame. This gene is also found in the virus lineage of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) and chimpanzee immunodeficiency virus (SIVcpz) and was recently described in viruses isolated from Cercopithecus nictitans, Cercopithecus mona, and Cercopithecus cephus.

40|$|AbstractThe {{relationship}} between primate foamy viruses {{was determined by}} comparing a 425 -bp DNA segment obtained by PCR using primers homologous to highly conserved portions of the pol gene. The phylogenetic tree of 14 foamy viruses investigated reflects the {{relationship between}} their host species: A cluster of Asian Old World <b>monkey</b> foamy <b>viruses</b> including simian foamy virus (SFV) prototypes 1 and 2 (isolated from Macaca cyclopsis) is separated from African Old World foamy viruses including prototype SFV- 3 and SFV- 3 strain LK- 3 (isolated from African green monkeys, Cercopithecus aethiops). These two clusters of Old World <b>monkey</b> foamy <b>viruses</b> are more distantly related to a cluster of ape and human foamy viruses including prototypes SFV- 6, SFV- 7, SFV cpz (all isolated from chimpanzees), and human foamy virus (HFV). The New World prototype SFV- 8 (isolated from a spider monkey, Ateles sp.) is distinct from the Old World cluster. Our own foamy virus isolates from a rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) and an African green monkey were grouped to the Asian or the African Old World <b>monkey</b> foamy <b>virus</b> cluster, respectively. The foamy virus sequences obtained from lymphocytes of two humans, one exposed to African green monkeys {{and the other to}} cultured HFV, were compared. The first sequence was closely related to the African Old World <b>monkey</b> foamy <b>virus</b> cluster, whereas the second was identical to HFV, except for a single mismatch. We conclude that limited sequencing of amplified DNA is a powerful tool for classification as well as molecular epidemiology of foamy viruses...|$|R

50|$|Many simple retroviruses, {{most notably}} Mason-Pfizer <b>monkey</b> <b>virus</b> (MPMV), do not encode a Rev-like protein, but instead have evolved a cis-acting RNA element, the {{constitutive}} transport element (CTE), that directly binds to {{components of the}} host mRNA export machinery.

The mammalian proteins (i.e., TC# 2.A.20.2.7) have been reported to function as viral receptors, but they undoubtedly function as transport proteins as well. For numerous gammaretroviruses, such as the gibbon ape leukemia virus, woolly <b>monkey</b> <b>virus,</b> feline leukemia virus subgroup B, feline leukemia virus subgroup T, and 10A1 murine leukemia virus, this receptor is the human type III sodium-dependent inorganic phosphate transporter, SLC20A1, also known as PiT1.|$|E

40|$|Use of Env in HIV vaccine {{development}} has been disappointing. Here we show that, {{in the presence of}} a biologically active Tat subunit vaccine, a trimeric Env protein prevents in <b>monkeys</b> <b>virus</b> spread from the portal of entry to regional lymph nodes.

These Tat effects do not require Tat-transactivation activity and are blocked by anti-integrin antibodies (Abs). Productive DC infection promoted by Tat is associated with a highly efficient virus transmission to T cells. In the Tat/Env complex the cysteine-rich region of Tat engages the Env V 3 loop, whereas the Tat RGD sequence remains free and directs the virus to integrins present on DCs. V 2 loop deletion, which unshields the CCR 5 binding region of Env, increases Tat/Env complex stability. O...|$|R

40|$|Poxviruses are {{important}} {{human and animal}} pathogens that have evolved elaborate strategies for antagonizing host innate and adaptive immunity. The E 3 protein of vaccinia virus, the prototypic member of the orthopoxviruses, functions as an inhibitor of innate immune signaling and is essential for vaccinia virus replication in vivo and in many human cell culture systems. However, the function of orthologues of E 3 expressed by poxviruses of other genera with different host specificity remains largely unknown. In the present study, we characterized the E 3 orthologues from sheeppox <b>virus,</b> yaba <b>monkey</b> tumor <b>virus,</b> swinepox virus, and myxoma virus {{for their ability to}} modulate protein kinase R (PKR) function, cytokine responses and virus pathogenicity. We found that the E 3 orthologues of myxoma virus and swinepox virus could suppress PKR activation and interferon (IFN) -induced antiviral activities and restore the host range function of E 3 in HeLa cells. In contrast, the E 3 orthologues from sheeppox <b>virus</b> and yaba <b>monkey</b> tumor <b>virus</b> were unable to inhibit PKR activation. While the sheeppox orthologue was unable to restore the host range function of E 3, the yaba <b>monkey</b> tumor <b>virus</b> orthologue partially restored E 3 -deficient vaccinia virus replication in HeLa cells, correlated with its ability to suppress IFN-induced antiviral activities.
