5|$|MacLachlan {{reported}} to No. 1 Depot, RAF Uxbridge {{and two days}} later attended No. 2 Central Medical Board on 13 August. He was certified fit to fly and flew Supermarine Spitfire on 21 August. He moved to Bournemouth to see his brother Gordon who was now a pilot officer in No. 501 Squadron RAF. At Queen Mary's Hospital he was fitted with a new arm. MacLachlan explained to the doctors that he required an arm {{that would allow him}} to fly a Hurricane. They designed a limb that allowed him to operate the throttle while taking the control column and firing button with his right hand. They spent hours studying the cockpit layout. The medical staff produced an arm with four spring-loaded pins, like fingers, which enabled him to use the controls on the port side of the cockpit. They secured his left arm to the levers of the throttle quadrant: throttle, propeller pitch control, supercharger and <b>mixture</b> <b>control.</b> The landing gear controls were located on the right side. The artificial arm had to interact with the control column while the gear was being retracted or lowered. His new arm proved sufficient and in September 1941 he flew as many hours in Hurricanes as possible, though not without incident. On 7 September 1941 he force-landed in darkness during a searchlight co-operation exercise. On 28 September 1941 he nearly collided with a Bristol Blenheim in low-cloud. Nevertheless, he was cleared for operational flying on 15 October.|$|E
25|$|Chamber C and chamber D are {{connected}} by a fuel passage which contains the fuel metering jets. When the <b>mixture</b> <b>control</b> lever is moved from the idle-cutoff position, fuel starts to flow through the metering jets and into chamber D where it becomes metered fuel.|$|E
25|$|The {{pressure}} of fuel from the fuel pump pushes against the diaphragm in chamber C, moving the servo valve toward the closed position. The fuel also flows to the <b>mixture</b> <b>control</b> valve, which is closed {{when in the}} idle-cutoff position and open in all other positions.|$|E

25|$|The first version, the Gladiator Mk I, was {{delivered}} from July 1936, becoming operational in January 1937. The Mk II soon followed, the main differences being {{a slightly more}} powerful Mercury VIIIAS engine with Hobson <b>mixture</b> <b>control</b> boxes and a partly automatic boost control carburettor, driving a Fairey fixed-pitch three-blade metal propeller, instead of the two-blade wooden one of the Mark I. All MK II Gladiators also carried Browning 0.303-inch machine guns (licence-manufactured by the BSA company in Birmingham) {{in place of the}} Vickers-Lewis combination of the MK I. A modified Mk II, the Sea Gladiator, was developed for the Fleet Air Arm (FAA), with an arrestor hook, catapult attachment points, a strengthened airframe and an underbelly fairing for a dinghy lifeboat, all for operations aboard aircraft carriers. Of the 98 aircraft built as, or converted to, Sea Gladiators, 54 were still in service by the outbreak of the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} 119 undelivered aircraft {{were bought}} {{up by the}} British Purchasing Commission and transferred to the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) for the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan between August and September 1940, and all were operational by November The type was named the Yale Mk.I following British naming practice of naming trainers after education institutions and US-supplied aircraft after American locations, in this case, Yale University, and were used initially as intermediate pilot trainers taking pilots from the de Havilland Tiger Moth and Fleet Finch to the much faster and more complex North American Harvard, until this category was dispensed with as being unnecessary. They were then relegated for use as airborne wireless radio trainers, along with the contemporary Fleet Fort intermediate trainer in 1943. Prior to service entry, the throttle and engine mixture controls were modified from the system used by the French whereby the throttle was pulled back to increase power, and the <b>mixture</b> <b>control</b> pulled back to lean out the mixture, to the system used on the Harvard. The Yale appeared in the movie Captains of the Clouds. The RCAF sold all surviving examples off as scrap in 1946 but over 30 survive today {{as a result of}} a large number of them being bought surplus by a single farmer, with about 15 currently in airworthy condition.|$|E

2500|$|Once {{airborne}} {{and having}} reached the cruising altitude, the pilot moves the <b>mixture</b> <b>control</b> from auto rich to auto lean. [...] This reduces fuel flow by closing the passageway through the rich jet. [...] The resulting reduction of flow unbalances the fuel metering diaphragm, causing the {{fuel metering valve}} to change position, thereby reducing fuel flow to the auto lean flow setting.|$|E
2500|$|The boost portion {{is mounted}} on the inlet side of the {{throttle}} body. [...] It measures air density, barometric pressure, and air flow into the carburetor. It is mounted directly in the [...] air flow at the inlet to the throat. The automatic <b>mixture</b> <b>control,</b> if equipped, [...] is mounted either on the boost portion for throttle bodies with two or more throats, or on the throttle body itself for the single throat models.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the event}} of a combat or {{emergency}} situation, the <b>mixture</b> <b>control</b> may be moved to the auto rich position, providing extra fuel to the engine, or in military aircraft, into military position, if the aircraft is so equipped. [...] When in the military position, the Anti-Detonation Injection (ADI) system is activated, injecting the ADI fluid into the engine intake system. [...] The pressure in the ADI system moves the derichment diaphragm in the fuel control to close off the derichment jet, reducing the fuel flow to a leaner mixture which produces higher engine power by raising the mean effective pressure. This causes the cylinder head temperature to increase to a very high level, which dramatically increases the risk of detonation (see: engine knocking). Adding the ADI fluid raises the mean octane level of the charge preventing pre-ignition and also lowers the cylinder temperatures to a more acceptable level. As this operation takes the engine well beyond its normal design limits, this power setting is not suitable for prolonged use. Once the ADI fluid is exhausted or if the <b>mixture</b> <b>control</b> valve is moved out of the military position, the fuel control derichment diaphragm pressure is lost, and the derichment jet is opened once again for normal fuel flow.|$|E

2500|$|Both {{available}} engines used a Bosch Motronic fully electronic {{engine control}} unit (ECU), with cylinder bank selective knock control, dual-barrel throttle valve, lambda <b>mixture</b> <b>control</b> via intake air volume metering and exhaust gas temperature sensor, and required unleaded petrol. Fuel was delivered to the combustion chambers via eight intake manifold-sited electronic fuel injectors, fed from two common fuel rails (one per cylinder bank), and were sequentially 'fired' or activated {{in accordance with the}} engine's firing order. [...] Whilst the 3.6V8 was able to use 95RON (91AKI) fuel, for the 4.2V8, the more expensive 98RON (93AKI) 'SuperPlus' unleaded was required in order to achieve the quoted power output. The usage of 95RON in the 4.2V8 resulted in a lower power output, as well as increased fuel consumption.|$|E

30|$|Though ideally {{additional}} {{experiments on}} wet illite and dry illite/quartz {{should be conducted}} at {{a wider range of}} temperatures, the current data suggest that the three-regime slip stability behaviour with velocity-weakening at intermediate temperature of wet illite/quartz gouges is critically dependent on water-assisted, thermally activated deformation of quartz. This is consistent with the microphysical model previously put forward by Den Hartog and Spiers (2014), in which the velocity-weakening behaviour of wet illite/quartz mixtures was interpreted {{to be the result of}} deformation of the illite/quartz <b>mixtures</b> <b>controlled</b> by a competition between shear-induced dilation and compaction involving thermally activated quartz deformation through pressure solution.|$|R

30|$|Nonplastic silt is {{a common}} {{alluvial}} deposit in the flood plain of Bangladesh. It is finer than sand and behaves like sand but different from elastic silt and clay.
