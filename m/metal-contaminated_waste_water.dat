40|$|The energy, {{mining and}} mineral {{processing}} industries are point sources of <b>metal-contaminated</b> <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> {{and carbon dioxide}} (CO 2). Freshwater macroalgae from the genus Oedogonium can be grown in <b>metal-contaminated</b> <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> to generate biomass for bioenergy applications and concomitantly bioremediate metals. However, interactions between CO 2 addition and algal growth, which can affect bioremediation, remain untested. The addition of CO 2 to algal cultures in the Ash Dam Water (ADW) from a coal-fired power station increased the biomass productivity of Oedogonium sp. from 6. 8 g dry weight (DW) m- 2 d- 1 {{to a maximum of}} 22. 5 g DW m - 2 d- 1. The greater productivity increased the rate of bioremediation of most elements. However, over time carbon-amended cultures experienced a decline in productivity. Possible explanations include metal toxicity at low pH or essential trace element limitation as a result of competition between toxic and essential trace elements for uptake into algae. Higher productivity increased bioremediation rate and yielded more biomass for bioenergy applications, making maintenance of maximum productivity the central aim of the integrated culture model. To do so {{it will be necessary to}} resolve the mechanisms responsible for declining yields over time in carbon-amended cultures. Regardless, our data demonstrate that freshwater macroalgae are ideal candidates for bioremediation of metal-contaminated waste streams. Algal culture delivered significant improvement in ADW quality, reducing 5 elements that were initially in excess of water quality criteria (Al, As, Cd, Ni and Zn) to meet guidelines within two to four weeks. © 2013 Roberts et al...|$|E
40|$|Macroalgae are a {{productive}} resource {{that can be}} cultured in <b>metal-contaminated</b> <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> for bioremediation {{but there have been}} no demonstrations of this biotechnology integrated with industry. Coal-fired power production is a water-limited industry that requires novel approaches to waste water treatment and recycling. In this study, a freshwater macroalga (genus Oedogonium) was cultivated in contaminated ash water amended with flue gas (containing 20 % CO 2) at an Australian coal-fired power station. The continuous process of macroalgal growth and intracellular metal sequestration reduced the concentrations of all metals in the treated ash water. Predictive modelling shows that the power station could feasibly achieve zero discharge of most regulated metals (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn) in waste water by using the ash water dam for bioremediation with algal cultivation ponds rather than storage of ash water. Slow pyrolysis of the cultivated algae immobilised the accumulated metals in a recalcitrant C-rich biochar. While the algal biochar had higher total metal concentrations than the algae feedstock, the biochar had very low concentrations of leachable metals and therefore has potential for use as an ameliorant for low-fertility soils. This study demonstrates a bioremediation technology at a large scale for a water-limited industry that could be implemented at new or existing power stations, or during the decommissioning of older power stations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

Al-Jaser Jumada (I) 1428 H - June 2007 GActivated sludge process is widely used for biological treatment of domestic and industrial wastewaters. The international association on water quality (IAWQ) developed activated sludge process models such as; ASM 1, ASM 2, ASM 2 d, and ASM 3 for the design and simulation of activated sludge treatment processes. The ASM 3 model is a replacement for the basic ASM 1 model that has introduced a new concept of biochemical storage products and corrects some of ASM 1 model deficiencies. Practical applicability of these models {{is limited by the}} non-availability of activated sludge process data (kinetic coefficients and <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> characteristics) for a specific <b>waste</b> <b>water.</b> This study aims to characterize and determine experimentally the values of major kinetic coefficients of ASM 3 for Riyadh's domestic <b>waste</b> <b>water.</b> Three sets of composite samples of raw and four sets of primary treated domestic <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> were obtained from Riyadh <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> treatment plant and extensively characterized. The average total COD, TSS, VSS, and TKN for the raw <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> were 1008, 603, 410, and 48. 3, and for primary treated wastewaters were 553, 249, 155, and 41. 9 mg/L, respectively. Calculated average VSS/TSS ratios indicate that about 70 % of suspended solids in raw <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> and 6 3 % of suspended solids in primary treated <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> are volatile. Batch respirometric experiments were conducted on raw and primary treated <b>waste</b> <b>waters</b> with acclimated activated sludge seed obtained from Riyadh <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> treatment plant. Automatic bench respirometer connected to a computer system was utilized for this purpose. Oxygen uptake rate (OUR) curves obtained from batch respirometric tests were analyzed to predict {{one of the most important}} <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> characteristics (readily biodegradable COD) and kinetic coefficients. The average readily biodegradable COD in Riyadh's domestic <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> was found to be around 32 % of total COD for raw <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> and 22 % for primary treated <b>waste</b> <b>water.</b> The storage yield (Y S T O) for Riyadh's domestic <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> was determined as 0. 78 for raw and 0. 71 for primary treated <b>waste</b> <b>waters.</b> ASM 3 kinetic coefficient, maximum rate of storage (k S T O), was on an average 1. 65 and 2. 76 (1 /d) for raw and primary treated <b>waste</b> <b>waters,</b> respectively.

40|$|The {{production}} {{and maintenance of}} Portland cement concrete pavements creates {{a considerable amount of}} <b>waste</b> <b>water,</b> usually with a high pH and high levels of dissolved and suspended solids and the safe disposal of this material can be costly. The ability to reuse this <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> as mixing water into new concrete production would be a more cost efficient option, which would greatly reduce waste. Due to the presence of existing cement particles and elevated pH, <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> with both hydrated and unhydrated cement particles used as mixing water affects the performance of the concrete. These effects can potentially be beneficial, even if the water has a percent solids higher than recommended in current mix water specifications. Therefore, a method of quantifying the characteristics of the <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> is necessary to predict the performance of the concrete based on measurable properties of the <b>waste</b> <b>water.</b> This study quantifies the characteristics of the <b>waste</b> <b>water,</b> including pH, conductivity, and index of refraction. Models are then developed using a regression analysis. This is accomplished by characterizing <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> produced using multiple different sources of both grinding and wash out fines.

5000|$|The Urban <b>Waste</b> <b>Water</b> Treatment Directive (full title Council Directive 91/271/EEC of 21 May 1991 {{concerning}} urban waste-water treatment) is a European Union directive regarding urban <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> collection, <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> {{treatment and}} its discharge, {{as well as}} the treatment and discharge of [...] "waste water from certain industrial sectors". It was adopted on 21 May 1991. It aims [...] "to protect the environment from the adverse effects of urban <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> discharges and discharges from certain industrial sectors" [...] by mandating <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> collection and treatment in urban agglomerations with a population equivalent of over 2000, and more advanced treatment in places with a population equivalent above 10,000 in sensitive areas.|$|R
40|$|The Bachelor Thesis {{deals with}} {{treatment}} of laboratory <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> containing chrome. It examines the chrome {{and its compounds}} in <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> from inorganic laboratory, trying to concentrate it in the <b>waste</b> <b>water.</b> It uses spectrophotometry with diphenylcarbazide as a method to determine concentration of chromium. To diminish the amount of chromium in <b>waste</b> <b>water,</b> precipitation with barium chloride is used prior to regular pressure filtration. Other part of the Thesis focus on the economic effectiveness of the treatment and its comparison to transport of the waste...|$|R
