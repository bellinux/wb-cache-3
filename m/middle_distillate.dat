It consists of three crude oil storage tanks, each with a capacity of 410,000 barrels. It has three major areas of operation: Crude Oil Operations, Condensate Stabilisation, and Gas Sales Facilities. Royal Dutch Shell started to establish the world's first Shell <b>Middle</b> <b>Distillate</b> Synthesis plant (Shell MDS) in 1993. It {{is also known as}} Bintulu Gas-To-Liquid plant (Bintulu GTL). The plant has a production capacity of 14,770 barrels per day with a total investment of over US$1billion as of the year 2010. The plant is staffed with 380 people, of whom 93% are Malaysians, with 80% of the staff coming from Sarawak.|$|E
500|$|The name of Bintulu {{was derived}} from the local native {{language}} [...] "Mentu Ulau" [...] (picking heads). Bintulu was a small fishing village when Rajah James Brooke acquired it in 1861. Brooke later built a fort there in 1862. In 1867, the first General Council meeting (now Sarawak State Legislative Assembly) was convened in Bintulu. It is the earliest state legislature system in Malaysia. The construction of the earliest airstrip in Bintulu began in 1934 but was halted in 1938 due to financial difficulties. During World War II, the airstrip was heavily bombed by Allied forces. The British later rebuilt the airstrip, and it became fully operational in 1955. The old airport was replaced by a new airport in 2002. Bintulu remained a fishing village until 1969 when oil and gas reserves were discovered off the coast. Since then, Bintulu has become the centre of energy intensive industries such as a Malaysia LNG plant, a Shell <b>Middle</b> <b>Distillate</b> Synthesis plant, and a Bintulu combined cycle power plant. The economy has also expanded into oil palm and forest plantations, palm oil processing, wood-waste processing, and cement manufacturing. The port of Bintulu is the busiest in Sarawak.

The {{hydrogenation}} experiments of the <b>middle</b> <b>distillate</b> (MD) of Chinese Huadian {{shale oil}} {{were carried out}} in a bench-scale trickle-bed reactor using a commercial catalyst Ni-Mo-W/Al 2 O 3 under various operating conditions. Three kinds of lumping kinetic models were developed in order to compare their capabilities to predict the concentrations of sulfur and nitrogen in hydrotreated oil samples. The results showed that three-lump and four-lump models can be reasonably used to describe hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN), respectively. The predictions made using lumping models agreed well with experimental data. The discrepancies between experimental and predicted data are smaller than 5 %. The three-lump model for HDS and the four-lump model for HDN were also utilized for predicting reactive features and obtaining suitable operating conditions for HDS and HDN of the <b>middle</b> <b>distillate</b> (MD) of Huadian shale oil.

Free fatty acid turns to soap that renders the trans-esterification process inoperable. Clean triglycerides such as soy, corn, and canola oils are low in FFA and easy to process but too expensive as fuel feedstocks. We have been exploring a system that combines thermal cracking of waste triglycerides with acid esterification. Middle distillates (bp 165 oC- 345 oC) obtained by continuous thermal cracking of waste triglycerides were batch-esterified using methanol and Amberlyst 36 (wet). The yields of <b>middle</b> <b>distillate</b> from thermal cracking ranged from 58 - 63 wt % for trap grease and 60 - 68 wt % for rendered animal fat.
