40|$|Abstract—This paper {{studies the}} optimum design for {{reducing}} optical loss of an 8 x 8 <b>mechanical</b> type <b>optical</b> <b>switch</b> {{due to the}} temperature change. The 8 x 8 <b>optical</b> <b>switch</b> is composed of a base, 8 input fibers, 8 output fibers, 3 fixed mirrors and 17 movable mirrors. First, an innovative switch configuration is proposed with thermal-compensated design. Most <b>mechanical</b> type <b>optical</b> <b>switches</b> have a disadvantage that their precision and accuracy {{are influenced by the}} ambient temperature. Therefore, the thermal-compensated design is to deal with this situation by using materials with different thermal expansion coefficients (α). Second, a parametric modeling program is developed to generate solid models for finite element analysis, and the thermal and structural behaviors of the switch are analyzed. Finally, an integrated optimum design program, combining Autodesk Inventor Professional software, finite element analysis software, and genetic algorithms, is developed for improving the thermal behaviors that the optical loss of the switch is reduced. By changing design parameters of the switch in the integrated design program, the final optimum design that satisfies the design constraints and specifications can be found.

40|$|Abstract—Multiwavelength cross-connects (WXC’s) {{will play}} a key role to provide more {{reconfiguration}} flexibility and net-work survivability in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) transport networks. In this paper, we utilize three different fiber Bragg grating (FBG) -based P-type, S-type, and N-type building blocks with optical circulators and related control devices for constructing large rearrangeably nonblocking N N WXC’s. The P-type building block is composed of certain “parallel ” FBG-element chains placed between the control devices of two large <b>mechanical</b> <b>optical</b> <b>switches</b> (OSW’s). The S-type building block consists of a “series ” of FBG elements and the control device of 2 2 OSW’s. The nonswitched N-type building block includes a “series ” of FBG elements with appropriate stepping motor or PZT control devices. All FBG elements, each with central wavelength corresponding to equally or unequally spaced WDM channel wavelengths, with high-reflectivity are required. Large N N WXC structures, with minimum number of required constitutive elements, based on a three-stage Clos network are then constructed. We investigate their relevant characteristics, compare the required constitutive elements, and estimate the dimension limits for these WXC architectures. Other related issues such as capacity expansion, wavelength channel spacing, and multiwavelength amplification are also addressed.

Molecules containing the azobenzene group have been heavily studied in this context. While {{the effects of the}} cis &# 8211; trans isomerization of the azo group in such molecules have been examined macroscopically by a number of techniques, modulations of the elastic modulus upon isomerization in self-assembled films were not yet measured directly.

Analysis of higher harmonics by means of a torsional harmonic cantilever allowed real-time extraction of mechanical data. Quantitative analysis of elastic modulus maps obtained simultaneously with topographic images show that the modulus of the cis -form is approximately twice that of the trans -isomer. Quantum mechanical and molecular dynamics studies show good agreement with this experimental result, and indicate that the stiffer response in the cis -form comprises contributions both from the individual molecular bonds and from intermolecular interactions in the film.

40|$|Effective optical {{interconnect}} {{is a fundamental}} requisite to realize Internet-scale data centres due to the capabilities and benefits of optical devices. Optical interconnects are energy efficient and support massive bandwidths. The performance of {{optical interconnect}}s {{is directly related to}} the type of <b>optical</b> <b>switches</b> and <b>optical</b> <b>switching</b> techniques used. <b>Optical</b> <b>switches</b> may be categorized into slow <b>optical</b> <b>switches</b> and fast <b>optical</b> <b>switches.</b> The <b>optical</b> <b>switching</b> techniques are <b>Optical</b> Circuit <b>Switching</b> (OCS), <b>Optical</b> Packet <b>Switching</b> (OPS) and <b>Optical</b> Burst <b>Switching</b> (OBS). This thesis presents three novel optical interconnection schemes which are based on <b>optical</b> burst <b>switching.</b> These schemes are called Hybrid <b>Optical</b> <b>Switch</b> Architecture (HOSA), HOSA with Traffic Demand Scheduling (TDS) and Fast <b>Optical</b> <b>Switch</b> Architecture (FOSA). The first two schemes are based on a hybrid design that utilizes fast and slow <b>optical</b> <b>switches</b> while the third scheme is based on using only fast <b>optical</b> <b>switches.</b> The proposed schemes consider OBS with a two-way reservation protocol that ensures zero burst loss. In the two-way reservation protocol, the connection is established for each burst before transmission. To evaluate the performance of these schemes, network-level simulation is used. The proposed architectures consider a single stage core topology that can be easily scaled up (in capacity) and scaled out (in the number of racks) without requiring major re-cabling and network reconfiguration. The proposed schemes feature separate data and control planes. The control plane comprises a centralized controller while the data plane contains an array of <b>optical</b> <b>switches.</b> A scalability analysis of the proposed topology is presented and shows that this topology is scalable to hundreds of thousands of servers. This thesis also presents a trade-off between cost and power consumption of the proposed designs by comparing them with conventional interconnects using analytical modelling. In HOSA, the key idea is to route high volume traffic through a fast <b>optical</b> <b>switch</b> during the reconfiguration of a slow <b>optical</b> <b>switch.</b> The traffic is moved to the slow <b>optical</b> <b>switch</b> once it is reconfigured. The aggregated traffic should be large enough so that it can bypass the slow <b>optical</b> <b>switch</b> during its reconfiguration phase. This technique hides the reconfiguration time of slow <b>optical</b> <b>switch</b> but the latency introduced due to burst aggregation is still high. In HOSA with TDS, small bursts are considered to reduce the latency of burst aggregation. The controller in HOSA with TDS technique maintains a traffic demand matrix which updates traffic demand on periodic intervals and assigns slow paths for the high traffic volume. A resource allocation algorithm is proposed that allocates paths of fast and slow <b>optical</b> <b>switches</b> efficiently. In HOSA with TDS, the control plane can only support applications that have high traffic stability. So for dynamically changing communication patterns, this thesis presents a new design called FOSA. The FOSA is based on only fast <b>optical</b> <b>switches</b> and it also uses OBS with the two-way reservation i. e. there is no additional burden on the control plane for maintaining traffic demands as was done in HOSA with TDS. The proposed technique shows considerable improvement in terms of throughput and packet loss ratio as compared to the traditional methods of OBS while performance comparable in terms of delay with the traditional methods of OBS is also achieved. The proposed technique also demonstrates performance comparable to that of electrical data centre networks. The performance of TCP over traditional OBS network is degraded by the bursts losses due to contention even at a low traffic load. In FOSA, the performance of the TCP is evaluated. Since in the proposed scheme, the burst loss is zero due to two way reservation, the results show significant improvement of TCP performance in terms of throughput, time and packets loss as compared to the traditional methods of OBS and the conventional electronic packet switching data centre networks for all types of workloads...|$|R
