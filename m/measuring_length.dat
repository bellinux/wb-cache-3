5|$|In 1889 {{there was}} no {{generally}} accepted theory regarding the nature of light but by 1960 the wavelength of specific light spectra could give a more accurate and reproducible value than a prototype metre. In that year the prototype metre {{was replaced by a}} formal definition that defines the metre in terms of the wavelength of specified light spectra. By 1983 it was accepted that the speed of light in vacuum was constant and that this constant provided a more reproducible procedure for <b>measuring</b> <b>length.</b> Therefore, the metre was redefined in terms of the speed of light. These definitions give a much better reproducibility and also allow anyone, anywhere with a suitably equipped laboratory, to make a standard metre.|$|E

25|$|Gaussian {{curvature}} is {{the product}} of the two principal curvatures. It is an intrinsic property that can be determined by <b>measuring</b> <b>length</b> and angles and is independent of how the surface is embedded in space. Hence, bending a surface will not alter the Gaussian curvature, and other surfaces with constant positive Gaussian curvature can be obtained by cutting a small slit in the sphere and bending it. All these other surfaces would have boundaries, and the sphere is the only surface that lacks a boundary with constant, positive Gaussian curvature. The pseudosphere {{is an example of a}} surface with constant negative Gaussian curvature.|$|E

5000|$|The paper {{examines}} the coastline paradox: the property that the <b>measured</b> <b>length</b> {{of a stretch}} of coastline depends {{on the scale of}} measurement. Empirical evidence suggests that the smaller the increment of measurement, the longer the <b>measured</b> <b>length</b> becomes. If one were to measure a stretch of coastline with a yardstick, one would get a shorter result than if the same stretch were measured with a one-foot (30.48 cm) ruler. This is because one would be laying the ruler along a more curvilinear route than that followed by the yardstick. The empirical evidence suggests a rule which, if extrapolated, shows that the <b>measure</b> <b>length</b> increases without limit as the measurement scale decreases towards zero.|$|R
