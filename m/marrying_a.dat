5|$|On April 12, 1716, an {{expedition}} led by Domingo Ramón left San Juan Bautista for Texas, intending to establish four missions and a presidio {{which would be}} guarded by twenty-five soldiers. The party of 75people included 3children, 7women, 18soldiers, and 10missionaries. These were the first recorded female settlers in Spanish Texas. After <b>marrying</b> <b>a</b> Spanish woman, St. Denis also joined the Spanish expedition.|$|E

He was survived by his mother, his two brothers, his sister and four children. His funeral took place July 25 at the Bethel Evangelical Free Church in Vashon Island.|$|E
5|$|The {{celebrations}} {{following the}} marriage of Catherine’s daughter Marguerite to the Protestant Henry of Navarre in Paris on 18 August 1572, were based on Huguenot themes. The match was controversial because Marguerite was <b>marrying</b> <b>a</b> Huguenot. The pope refused to grant a dispensation for the marriage, and the different faiths of the bridal couple made for an unusual wedding service. After a nuptial lunch, four days of balls, masques and banquets ensued.|$|E

5|$|A corrupt {{political}} leader named Chedi Singh (Sonu Sood) meets Chulbul and both quickly become enemies. Makkhi asks {{his father to}} arrange his marriage with Nirmala. His father refuses because he needs money to repay the loans he took to make his factory, and he believes that he can acquire money through his son <b>marrying</b> <b>a</b> rich girl. In desperate need of money, Makkhi steals from Chulbul's cupboard and gives the stolen cash to Nirmala's father, hoping that he will permit Makkhi to marry Nirmala. Meanwhile, Chulbul meets Rajjo and proposes marriage, which she rejects, as she has {{to take care of}} her father, Haria (Mahesh Manjrekar)—a drunkard.|$|E
5|$|After <b>marrying</b> <b>a</b> U.S. Army {{non-commissioned officer}} in 1950, Katsura emigrated {{with him to}} the United States in 1951. There she was invited to play in the 1952 U.S.-sponsored World Three-Cushion Championship, {{ultimately}} taking seventh place at that competition. Katsura was the first woman ever to be included in any world billiards tournament. Her fame cemented, Katsura went on an exhibition tour of the United States with eight-time world champion Welker Cochran, and later with 51-time world champion Willie Hoppe. In 1953 and 1954 she again competed for the world three-cushion crown, taking fifth and fourth places respectively.|$|E

The new marriage produced new sons, whom Ivan Alexander proceeded to crown co-emperors, Ivan Šišman in about 1356 and Ivan Asen V by 1359. Ivan Alexander's last surviving son from his first marriage, the co-emperor Ivan Sracimir, became effectively independent around 1356; and Ivan Alexander's control over other powerful vassals, such as the rulers of Wallachia and Dobruja, who pursued their own foreign policies, was hardly stronger.|$|E
5|$|Born on 14 March 1822 in Naples, TeresaCristina {{became an}} orphan {{when her father}} died in 1830. Her mother {{is said to have}} {{neglected}} her after <b>marrying</b> <b>a</b> young officer in 1839. Historiography has long asserted that she was raised in lonely isolation, in an environment of religious superstition, intolerance and conservatism. It has also described Teresa Cristina as a soft and timid character, unlike her ruthless father or her impulsive mother. She has even been depicted as unassertive, and accustomed to be satisfied in whatever circumstances she found herself.|$|E
5|$|By 926 Sihtric {{had evidently}} {{acknowledged}} Æthelstan as over-king, adopting Christianity and <b>marrying</b> <b>a</b> sister of Æthelstan at Tamworth.

His kinsman, perhaps brother, Gofraid, who had remained as his deputy in Dublin, came from Ireland to take power in York, but failed. Æthelstan moved quickly, seizing much of Northumbria. In less than a decade, {{the kingdom of the}} English had become by far the greatest power in Britain and Ireland, perhaps stretching as far north as the Firth of Forth.|$|E
30|$|Figure  1 {{shows that}} {{migrants}} who <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> German have lower intensions to return {{both before and}} after marriage than their counterparts who <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> non-German spouse. Among women who <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> German spouse, we actually observe a drop in intentions to return a few years before marriage. For women who <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> non-German spouse, intentions to return slightly increase for a few years subsequent to marriage. We see a similar increase in intentions to return in the years around marriage for male migrants who <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> non-German, and their intentions to return remain high (about 87 % intend to return). In comparison, far fewer men who <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> German spouse intend to return throughout the 15 -year period (roughly 77 %).|$|R

The wedding took place not in Greece, but in Oldenburg, on 22 November 1836; the marriage {{did not produce}} an heir, and the new queen made herself unpopular by interfering in the government and maintaining her Lutheran faith. Otto was unfaithful to his wife, and had a liaison with Jane Digby, a notorious woman his father had previously taken as a lover.|$|E
5|$|If found, punishments {{ranged from}} death, {{to time in}} the pillory, to being ordered never to dress as a man again. Henry Fielding wrote a {{pamphlet}} titled The Female Husband in 1746, based {{on the life of}} Mary Hamilton, who was arrested after <b>marrying</b> <b>a</b> woman while masquerading as a man, and was sentenced to public whipping and six months in jail. Similar examples were procured of Catharine Linck in Prussia in 1717, executed in 1721; Swiss Anne Grandjean married and relocated with her wife to Lyons, but was exposed by a woman with whom she had had a previous affair and sentenced to time in the stocks and prison.|$|E
5|$|Intent {{on keeping}} his {{succession}} secure, Cnut sent Ironside's two infant sons, Edward and Edmund Ætheling, {{to his brother}} in Sweden, where {{they were to be}} murdered. Instead, the princes were spared and sent to safety to the Kingdom of Hungary, where they remained in the care of King Stephen I. After fleeing assassins hired by Cnut, the Æthelings arrived at the royal court of Kievan Rus' in 1028. The princes remained under the tutelage of Prince Yaroslav the Wise until adulthood. In 1046, the Æthelings both traveled to Hungary and helped the exiled Andrew of Hungary in his quest for the throne. Edmund died shortly after <b>marrying</b> <b>a</b> Hungarian princess, before 1054.|$|E
30|$|By contrast, Figure  2 {{depicts a}} much smaller {{difference}} {{in the proportion of}} migrants who send remittances and <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> German spouse rather than a non-German. Figure  2, panel a depicts an upward shift in the number of men who send remittances after marriage. The shift is especially large for men who <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> non-German spouse, among whom, few report sending remittances before marriage. Interestingly, more men who <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> German spouse remit before marriage than their counterparts who <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> non-German. But after marriage slightly more male migrants who <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> non-German remit. The number of women who remit is much more constant around marriage. Similar proportions of women who <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> German and a non-German spouse send remittances until about three years after marriage, then many women who <b>married</b> <b>a</b> German spouse stop remitting. Observations for the year of marriage seem to be extremely noisy and are thus excluded from the analysis.|$|R

Bethe's action shocked Franck and Bohr. Although an eminent physicist, Bethe would not be invited to visit the Niels Bohr Institute until after the Second World War.

5|$|Although Louis had {{designated}} Mary as {{his successor}} {{in both of}} his kingdoms, the Polish nobles, seeking {{an end to the}} personal union with Hungary, were not willing to recognize Mary and her fiancé Sigismund as their sovereigns. They would have accepted Mary if she had moved to Kraków and reigned over both kingdoms from there rather than from Hungary, ruling according to their advice rather than that of the Hungarian nobles and <b>marrying</b> <b>a</b> prince of their choosing. Their intentions, however, were not to Elizabeth's taste. She too would have been required to move to Kraków, where a lack of men loyal to her would have rendered her unable to enforce her own will. Elizabeth was also aware of the difficulties her mother-in-law had faced during her regency in Poland, which had ended with the old queen fleeing her native kingdom in disgrace.|$|E

The clothes are of high quality, with many items still unworn in their original tissue paper and boxes, the price tags and delivery information still attached.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, {{the physics}} {{department}} at Cornell {{was looking for}} a new theoretical physicist, and Lloyd Smith strongly recommended Bethe. This was supported by Bragg, who was visiting Cornell at the time. In August 1934, Cornell offered Bethe a position as an acting assistant professor. Bethe had already accepted a fellowship for a year to work with Nevill Mott at the University of Bristol for a semester, but Cornell agreed to let him start in the spring of 1935. Before leaving for the United States, he visited the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen in September 1934, where he proposed to Hilde Levi, who accepted. However, the match was opposed by Bethe's mother, who did not want him <b>marrying</b> <b>a</b> Jewish girl, despite being Jewish herself, and Bethe broke off their engagement a few days before their wedding date in December.
