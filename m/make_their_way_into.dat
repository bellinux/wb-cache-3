With six of his friends, armed with guns, Mike ventures into the forest to hunt the shark. The shark kills each person except for Mike.

5|$|The first trade dollars {{were struck}} in 1873, and the {{majority}} of the coins were sent to China. Eventually, bullion producers began converting large amounts of silver into trade dollars, causing the coins to <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> American commercial channels. This caused frustration among those to whom they were given in payment, as the coins were largely maligned and traded for less than one dollar each. In response to their wide distribution in American commerce, the coins were officially demonetized in 1876, but continued to circulate. Production of business strikes ended in 1878, though the mintage of proof coins officially continued until 1883. The trade dollar was re-monetized when the Coinage Act of 1965 was signed into law.|$|E

5|$|Garista, the {{strategist}} for the Niren Corps, attempts to dissuade Niren {{but to no}} avail. The investigation in the fortress {{turns out to be}} more dangerous as the aer begins to turn the fortress into a living weapon to attack the knights. The knights <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the center of the fortress, where a giant blastia is found to be using the aer. Niren uses the device given by Rita to stifle the gushing of aer, but a backlash is caused by the sudden ceasing of aer flow, and the blastia explodes, destroying the barrier blastia that keeps Shizontonia safe, knocking out Chastel, and causing the fortress to begin to crumble. As Niren attempts to carry Chastel to safety, the floor beneath him crumbles. Niren is able to throw Chastel to Yuri and is stranded in a sinkhole of gushing aer. Despite Yuri's attempts to save him, due to a wound he received during the investigation, Niren is unable to pull himself to safety. Leaving his blastia with Yuri, Niren has the knights leave without him.|$|E

Upon {{discovering}} documents revealing that Operation Hatoful was a Hawk Party project into developing biological weapons for use against humans using the school as an experimental facility—with a focus on a strain of H5N1 almost immediately lethal to humans dubbed the Charon virus—Nageki recalls that the fire was caused by his committing suicide by self-immolation after months of forced experimentation in order to destroy and remove any trace of the virus, which was isolated in his body, and that researchers often went in through the chemistry preparation room. Ryouta, Kazuaki, and Anghel <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the medical center's basement through the chemistry lab and encounter Labor 9, electrocuting it using a stun gun given to Ryouta earlier by Mister One.

25|$|The {{image of}} the ninja entered popular culture in the Edo period, when folktales and plays about ninja were conceived. Stories about the ninja are usually based on {{historical}} figures. For instance, many similar tales exist about a daimyō challenging a ninja to prove his worth, usually by stealing his pillow or weapon while he slept. Novels were written about the ninja, such as Jiraiya Gōketsu Monogatari, which was also made into a kabuki play. Fictional figures such as Sarutobi Sasuke would eventually <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> comics and television, where {{they have come to}} enjoy a culture hero status outside their original mediums.|$|E
25|$|The electoral {{start of}} 1888 brought an {{explosive}} situation. All opposition forces, including Fleva's group, reached {{most of their}} electoral goals, even though the government remained in place. On March 14, when Carol returned from a visit to Berlin, Fleva, with Catargiu, Blaremberg and various others, instigated a riot which began at Orfeu Hall, Bucharest. Under their supervision, the crowd trying to occupy the building and make it an anti-government fief found its access blocked by pro-government men (soldiers, mounted Gendarmes, police or simply National Liberal militants). A chase followed through the city center, and the rioters attempted to <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the (old) Royal Palace, to demand that the king dispose of Brătianu.

25|$|After {{locating}} a bird, {{the parasite}} penetrates {{through the skin}} (usually the feet), dropping the forked tail in the process. Inside the circulatory system, the immature worms (schistosomula) develop into mature male and female worms, mate and migrate through the host’s circulatory system (or nervous system in case of T. regenti) to the final location (veins feeding the gastrointestinal tract) within the host body. There they lay eggs in the small veins in the intestinal mucosa from which they <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the lumen of the gut, and are dumped into the water when the bird defecates. One European species, Trichobilharzia regenti, instead infects the bird host’s nasal tissues and larvae hatch from the eggs directly in the tissue during drinking/feeding of the infected birds.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{being at}} times a co-belligerant of Nazi Germany, Finland {{remained}} independent and its leadership flatly {{refused to cooperate}} with Heinrich Himmler's request to relinquish its 2,000 Jews. Some Jews were even able to flee Nazi occupied Europe and <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> Finland. Only seven of the 300 alien Jews living in Finland were {{turned over to the}} Germans. Even the deportation of a handful of Jews did not go unnoticed, as there were protests in Finland from members of its indigenous Social Democratic Party, by a number of Lutheran ministers, the Archbishop, and the Finnish Cabinet. Like Denmark, Finland was one of only two countries in the orbit of Nazi domination that refused to cooperate fully with Hitler's regime. These historical observations do not outright excuse the Finns entirely, as some scholars point out—in particular, the Einsatzkommando Finnland was formed during the joint invasion of the Soviet Union, which received collaboration from Finnish police units and Finnish military intelligence in capturing partisans, Jews, and Soviet POWs as part of their operations— exactly how many of each group remains unclear and is a subject in need of further research according to historian Paul Lubotina.|$|E
25|$|Orchestras {{first used}} the bassoon to {{reinforce}} the bass line, and as the bass of the double reed choir (oboes and taille). Baroque composer Jean-Baptiste Lully and his Les Petits Violons included oboes and bassoons along with the strings in the 16-piece (later 21-piece) ensemble, {{as one of the}} first orchestras to include the newly invented double reeds. Antonio Cesti included a bassoon in his 1668 opera Il pomo d'oro (The Golden Apple). However, use of bassoons in concert orchestras was sporadic until the late 17th century when double reeds began to <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> standard instrumentation. This was largely due to the spread of the hautbois to countries outside France. Increasing use of the bassoon as a basso continuo instrument meant that it began to be included in opera orchestras, first in France and later in Italy, Germany and England. Meanwhile, composers such as Joseph Bodin de Boismortier, Michel Corrette, Johann Ernst Galliard, Jan Dismas Zelenka, Johann Friedrich Fasch and Telemann wrote demanding solo and ensemble music for the instrument. Antonio Vivaldi brought the bassoon to prominence by featuring it in 37 concerti for the instrument.|$|E
50|$|The {{threatened}} {{invasion of}} India finally happened in 1944. The V Force detachments forward of Imphal were engulfed. They could provide some intelligence of Japanese moves during the invasion, but they lacked supplies (the local dumps {{had been drawn}} down over 1943) and {{there were too many}} demands on Allied transport aircraft to allow supply drops to them.

Out of some 25,000 North Korean defectors living in South Korea 800 are missing, some of them due to defecting back to the North. In the first half of 2012 alone there were 200 cases of such double defectors, although officially the South Korean Ministry of Unification recognizes only 13.|$|R

Shortly after their arrival, the State Alchemist Solf J. Kimblee takes Winry to the north as a hostage, unknown to Winry, in order to force Edward to continue his work. When the brothers are ordered to capture Scar, they end up using his help to move Winry to a safe place.
