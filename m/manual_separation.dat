40|$|Since {{the advent}} of {{magnetic}} resonance (MR) imaging as a sound medical imaging technique {{there has been a}} need to classify the tissues in the images created. Typically the radiologist has been responsible for the evaluation of the images produced by the MRI machine. In any given MRI there exists many different types of tissues each with a certain concentration of spin densities. Each one of these tissues has a unique T 1 and T 2 decay times along with a with a unique spin density. The T 2 values are indicative {{of the structure of the}} tissue, and if the T 2 time of a particular tissue has been previously determined the type of tissue can be determined. This is useful for automatic identification of disease, tumors, or any tissue for that matter. This information is characteristic for a particular tissue across MRI platforms. When the imaging sequence is specified that keeps the time of repetition (TR) constant, the image is a T 2 weighted image. The method used in this paper, the Direct Exponential Curve Resolution algorithm (DECRA), attempts to evaluate these unique T 2 times and classify the images. Antalek and Windig (4) have shown that by using DECRA it is possible to classify images based on T 2. The goal of this experiment is to determine the weaknesses and limitations of DECRA when applied to synthetically generated images and real images obtained from a MRI machine. This method was analyzed to see if there was a possibility of improvement for future application and improvement. To test DECRA it was applied to synthetic images and real images obtained from an imager. The synthetic images where given noise to try to simulate a real image and to see how high the signal to noise ratio had to be. DECRA was able to segment the noiseless synthetic images, but began to fail as the numbers of pixels were reduced.

40|$|For {{the first}} time {{with the help of the}} theory of {{analytic}} functions and Kolosov-Muskhelishvili formulas the problem of the two-dimensional theory of elasticity for a thickwalled ring with the uneven pressures, acting on its borders, was solved. The pressure on the inner and outer boundaries is represented by Fourier series. The authors represent the two complex functions which solve boundary problem in the form of Laurent series. The logarithmic terms in these series are absent because the boundary problem has the self-balancing loads on each boundary of ring. The coefficients in the Laurent series are calculated by the boundary conditions. Firstly, the equations were obtained in the general form. But the hypothesis about even distributions of pressures at borders of ring was used for constructing an example. It leads to the fact that all coefficients of analytic functions represented in Laurent series have to be only real. As a solving example, the representation of pressures in equivalent hypotrochoids was used. The application of the computer algebra system Mathematica greatly simplifies the calculation of the distribution of stresses and displacements in ring. It does not require <b>manual</b> formal <b>separation</b> of real and imaginary parts in terms of Kolosov-Muskhelishvili to display the distribution of the physical parameters.

50|$|An {{established}} post-treatment {{system is}} classification processing. In this system, the waste streams are separated into {{different types of}} waste materials. The types of waste materials are classified into recyclable materials, hazardous materials, organic materials, inorganic materials. Generally, waste materials are separated using mechanical separation and <b>manual</b> <b>separation.</b> Mechanical separations are used for separating metals and other materials that may be harmful to the environment, and also to prepare the waste stream for manual separations. <b>Manual</b> <b>separation</b> have two types of sorting which are positive sorting and negative sorting. Positive sorting collects reusable waste such as recyclable and organic materials while negative sorting collects unusable waste such as hazardous and inorganic materials. After this separation process, the recyclable materials are transferred for reuse. The organic wastes are often treated using chemical processes (e.g. combustion, pyrolysis etc.) or biological treatment (microbial decomposition). The products obtained from these waste organic materials are {{in the form of}} Refuse-Derived Fuel. RDF can be used in many ways to generate electricity or even used alongside with traditional sources of fuel in coal power plants.

5000|$|A cotton gin is {{a machine}} that quickly and easily {{separates}} cotton fibers from their seeds, allowing for much greater productivity than <b>manual</b> cotton <b>separation.</b> The fibers are then processed into various cotton goods such as linens, while any undamaged cotton is used largely for textiles like clothing. Seeds {{may be used to}} grow more cotton or to produce cottonseed oil. Handheld roller gins had been used in India and then other countries since at earliest 500 CE. The Indian worm-gear roller gin, invented some time around the sixteenth century, has, according to Lakwete, remained virtually unchanged up to the present time. A modern mechanical cotton gin was created by American inventor Eli Whitney in 1793 and patented in 1794. Whitney's gin used a combination of a wire screen and small wire hooks to pull the cotton through, while brushes continuously removed the loose cotton lint to prevent jams. It revolutionized the cotton industry in the United States, but also led to the growth of slavery in the American South as the demand for cotton workers rapidly increased. The invention has thus been identified as an inadvertent contributing factor to the outbreak of the American Civil War. Modern automated cotton gins use multiple powered cleaning cylinders and saws, and offer far higher productivity than their hand-powered forebears.|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Method for separating {{a group of}} cells, present in an image of a sample, into individual cells for subsequent classification of the cells, where the group comprises several overlapping cells. First (a) the nucleus (ZK 1) of a first cell (Z 1) is selected, where Z 1 is adjacent to the nucleus (ZK 2) of a second cells (Z 2), with overlap between cytoplasms of both cells to form combined cytoplasm (ZP). Then (b) a constriction of ZP between the two nuclei is identified; (c) ZP is separated at this constriction and (d) a region of ZP is defined in which overlap between cytoplasms of Z 1 and Z 2 is expected. The defined region is (e) classified so as to assign individual segments of it to cytoplasms of Z 1 or Z 2 and (f) the cytoplasm of Z 1, from step (c), is completed, based on the segment classification of (e). USE - The method is particularly applied to smear samples being analyzed for presence of cancer cells, e. g. cervical smears. ADVANTAGE - The method recognizes overlapping cells and separates them, making possible automated classification and evaluation of the sample. <b>Manual</b> cell <b>separation</b> is avoided and information contained in overlapping cells is made available, resulting in a more reliable classification of the sample...|$|R

We evaluated a new method for Bence Jones Protein (BJP) detection and characterization on native urine samples by the Paragon CZE (TM) 2000 system. To avoid interference in electrophoretic separation, urine samples were preliminarily treated for the selective removal of interfering salt particles. Design and methods: The evaluation was done on a total of 350 fresh 24 -h urine samples. The salt particle removal consisted of a <b>manual</b> chromatographic <b>separation,</b> optimized {{in the course of}} our evaluation. Capillary zone urinary protein electrophoresis (CZ-UPE) was compared with conventional high-resolution electrophoresis on an agarose gel, while capillary immunosubtraction (CZU-IFE) was compared with agarose gel immunofixation. Results: After finding a consistent protein loss in eluates, the preanalytical treatment was optimized by changing sample dilution and eluate collection. The within- and between-run imprecision values for monoclonal peaks corresponding to BJP ranged from 0. 4 - 12. 2 % to 3. 3 - 6. 3 %, respectively. The detection limit for BJP, defined as the lowest measurable monoclonal peak on CZ-UPE, was 0. 0012 g/L for kappa BJP and 0. 0007 g/L for lambda BJP. CZ-UPE and CZU-IFE sensitivities were significantly lower in urine samples with a total protein level 100 mg/L (92 % and 94 %, respectively). Comparison between BJP measurements obtained from densitometric scanning with those from absorbance tracing showed a correlation coefficient of 0. 994 and a bias of 29. 8 mg/L. Conclusions: Paragon CZE (TM) 2000 can be introduced in routine for screening and typing of BJP; in urine samples with a total protein level > 100 mg/L, the performance is consistent with results from published validation studies on CZE applied to serum samples.

Atomic emission spectroscopy (AES) detection for chromatographic separations offers excellent selectivity and sensitivity and provides elemental information. The helium-microwave induced plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (He-MIP AES), suitable for detection of nonmetals (Cl, Br, I, S, P), has been successfully employed in conjunction with gas chromatography. However, with liquid chromatography (HPLC), the performance of MIPs is severely affected due to solvent loading. Membrane desolvators provide high analyte transport and desolvation efficiencies with most solvents. This dissertation focuses on application of the ultrasonic nebulizer (USN) -membrane desolvator-He MIP system as a detector for reverse-phase HPLC. Transport of the volatile organic analytes was maximized by temperature optimization of the membrane desolvator. Temperature in the 50 °C range provided efficient desolvation while minimizing analyte loss due to transport through the membrane. Modifying the solvent with dilute H 2 SO 4 served to maximize analyte transport by reducing the volatility of the solvent. The inability of USN with a fixed frequency (1. 4 MHz) automatic transducer to nebulize certain HPLC solvents (aqueous solutions of 10 [...] 70 % methanol:water and acetonitrile:water) was remedied by frequency optimization using a <b>manual</b> transducer controller. <b>Separation</b> and detection of a mixture of 2, 6 dichlorobenzamide (DCB) and 4 chlorobenzamide (CB) using a 60 % aqueous solution of methanol was achieved by the HPLC-MIP AES detector. The detection limits were 36 and 47 ng/s for DCB and CB, respectively. The selectivity of the HPLC-MIP AES system was demonstrated with the detection of vitamin B 12 in a mixture of vitamin B 1, B 6, and B 12. Superior sensitivity of the plasma AES detection over UV detection systems was exhibited via separation and detection of a mixture of beta-glycerophosphate and triphenylphosphene. UV inactive beta-glycerophosphate could be detected using the P emission line at 253. 7 nm by MIP AES. Detection limits were 3. 3 ng/s. Usually difficult by plasma spectrometry, detection of high molecular weight compounds could be achieved. Greater than 10 kb, DNA samples from salmon testes were successfully detected. MIP AES with membrane desolvation is a viable detection technique for reverse-phase HPLC. However, studies to further improve the detection limits are necessary...|$|R

The electronic devices are also stripped of their heavy metal components; this process in turn exposes workers to the raw elements of the metals.

5000|$|EBs {{are formed}} by the homophilic binding of the Ca2+ {{dependent}} adhesion molecule E-cadherin, which is highly expressed on undifferentiated ESCs. [...] When cultured as single cells {{in the absence of}} anti-differentiation factors, ESCs spontaneously aggregate to form EBs. Such spontaneous formation is often accomplished in bulk suspension cultures whereby the dish is coated with non-adhesive materials, such as agar or hydrophilic polymers, to promote the preferential adhesion between single cells, rather than to the culture substrate. As hESC undergo apoptosis when cultured as single cells, EB formation often necessitates the use of inhibitors of the rho associated kinase (ROCK) pathway, including the small molecules Y-27632 and 2,4 disubstituted thiazole (Thiazovivin/Tzv). [...] Alternatively, to avoid dissociation into single cells, EBs can be formed from hESCs by <b>manual</b> <b>separation</b> of adherent colonies (or regions of colonies) and subsequently cultured in suspension. Formation of EBs in suspension is amenable to the formation of large quantities of EBs, but provides little control over the size of the resulting aggregates, often leading to large, irregularly shaped EBs.
