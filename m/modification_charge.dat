40|$|Highly {{energetic}} jets {{are sensitive}} probes for the kinematics and the topology of nuclear collisions. Jets are collimated sprays of charged and neutral particles, which are {{produced in the}} fragmentation of hard scattered partons in the early stage of the collision. The measurement of nuclear <b>modification</b> of <b>charged</b> jet spectra in p–Pb collisions provides an important way of quantifying the effects of cold nuclear matter in the initial state on jet production, fragmentation, and hadronization. Unlike in Pb–Pb collisions, modifications of jet production due to hot nuclear matter effects {{are not expected to}} occur in p–Pb collisions. Therefore, measurements of nuclear <b>modifications</b> in <b>charged</b> jet spectra in p–Pb collisions (commonly known as $R_{pPb}$) can be used to isolate and quantify cold nuclear matter effects. Potential nuclear effects are expected to be more pronounced in more central p–Pb collisions due to a higher probability of an interaction between the proton and the lead-nucleus. To measure the centrality dependence of charged jet spectra, it is crucial to use a reliable definition of event centrality, which ALICE developed utilizing the Zero-Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) ...|$|R

40|$|Charging of {{materials}} by incident radiation {{is affected by}} both environmental and physical conditions. Modifying a material’s physical surface will change its reflection, transmission and absorption of the incident radiation which are integrally related to the accumulation of charge and energy deposition in the material. An optical analysis {{of the effect of}} surface <b>modification</b> on spacecraft <b>charging</b> parameters on prototypical Kapton HN and Cu samples is presented. Samples were roughened with abrasive compounds ranging from 0. 5 to 10 μm in size, comparable to the range of incident wavelengths. They were also contaminated with thin layers of DC 704 diffusion pump oil. Using a UV/VIS/NIR light source and a diffraction grating spectrometer, measurements were performed on pristine and modified materials. The measured spectra confirmed that surface modification does induce changes in optical reflection, transmission, and absorption. The generally increased absorption observed results in increased photon energy deposited in the material, leading to increased charge emission through the photoelectric effect.

40|$|This study {{describes}} how <b>charge</b> <b>modification</b> affects aggregation of ovalbumin, thereby distinguishing {{the role of}} conformational and electrostatic stability in the process. Ovalbumin variants were engineered using chemical methylation or succinylation to obtain a range of protein net charge from - 1 to - 26. <b>Charge</b> <b>modification</b> significantly affected the denaturation temperature. From urea-induced equilibrium denaturation studies, it followed that unfolding proceeded via an intermediate state. However, the heat-induced denaturation process could still {{be described as a}} two-state irreversible unfolding transition, suggesting that the occurrence of an intermediate has no influence on the kinetics of unfolding. By monitoring the aggregation kinetics, the net charge was found not to be discriminative in the process. It is concluded that the dominant factor determining ovalbumin aggregation propensity is the rate of denaturation and not electrostatic repulsive forces. © 2007 American Chemical Society...|$|R

40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae is a {{major cause}} of {{morbidity}} and mortality worldwide. Its polysaccharide capsule causes resistance to phagocytosis and interferes with the innate immune system's ability to clear infections at an early stage. Nevertheless, we found that encapsulated pneumococci are sensitive to killing by a human neutrophil granule extract. We fractionated the extract by high-performance liquid chromatography and identified α-defensins by mass spectrometry as the proteins responsible for killing pneumococci. Analysis of sensitivity to the commercial α-defensins human neutrophil proteins 1 to 3 (HNP 1 - 3) confirmed these findings. We analyzed the sensitivities of different pneumococcal strains to HNP 1 - 3 and found that encapsulated strains are efficiently killed at physiological concentrations (7. 5 μg/ml). Surprisingly, nonencapsulated, nonvirulent pneumococci were significantly less sensitive to α-defensins. The proposed mechanisms of α-defensin resistance in nonencapsulated pneumococci is surface <b>charge</b> <b>modification,</b> e. g., by introduction of positive charge by d-alanylation of surface-exposed lipoteichoic acids.
