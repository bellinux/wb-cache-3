40|$|We {{develop a}} simple {{theory of flows}} to study the flow of data in {{real-time}} computing networks. Flow Theory is based on discrete and nondeterministic mathematics, rather than the customary continuous or probabilistic mathematics. The theory features two types of flows: smooth and uniform, and eight types of <b>flow</b> <b>operators.</b> We prove that, if the input flow {{to any of these}} operators is smooth or uniform, then both the internal buffer and delay of that operator are bounded. Linear networks of <b>flow</b> <b>operators</b> are introduced, and their internal buffers and delays are derived from the internal buffers and delays of their constituent <b>operators.</b> We extend <b>Flow</b> Theory {{so that it can be}} used in analyzing cyclic networks and networks of multiflows. Since many rate-reservation protocols can be represented as linear networks of <b>flow</b> <b>operators,</b> we use <b>Flow</b> Theory to prove that a number of these protocols (Stop-and-Go, Hierarchical Round-Robin, Weighted Fair Queueing, Self-Clocking Fair Queueing, and Virtual Clock) require bounded buffering and introduce bounded delay...|$|R
40|$|The {{distributions}} of two-jet event shapes contain information on hadronization in QCD. Near the two-jet limit, these distributions {{can be described}} by convolutions of nonperturbative event shape functions with the same distributions calculated in resummed perturbation theory. The shape functions, in turn, are determined by correlations of momentum <b>flow</b> <b>operators</b> {{with each other and}} with light-like Wilson lines, which describe the coupling of soft, wide-angle radiation to jets. We observe that leading power corrections to the mean values of event shapes are determined by the correlation of a single momentum <b>flow</b> <b>operator</b> with the relevant Wilson lines. This generalizes arguments for the universality of leading power corrections based on the low-scale behavior of the running coupling or resummation. We also show how a study of the angularity event shapes can provide information on correlations involving multiple momentum <b>flow</b> <b>operators,</b> giving a window to the system of QCD dynamics that underlies the variety of event shape functions. In deriving these results, we review, develop and compare factorization techniques in conventional perturbative QCD and soft-collinear effective theory (SCET). We give special emphasis to the elimination of double counting of momentum regions in these two formalisms. Comment: 25 pages revtex...|$|R

40|$|A new {{framework}} {{for the analysis of}} unstable oscillator flows is explored. In linear settings, temporally growing perturbations in a non-parallel flow represent unstable eigenmodes of the linear <b>flow</b> <b>operator.</b> In nonlinear settings, self-sustained periodic oscillations of finite amplitude are commonly described as nonlinear global modes. In both cases the flow dynamics may be qualified as being endogenous, as opposed to the exogenous behaviour of amplifier flows driven by external forcing. This paper introduces the endogeneity concept, a specific definition of the sensitivity of the global frequency and growth rate with respect to variations of the <b>flow</b> <b>operator.</b> The endogeneity, defined both in linear and nonlinear settings, characterizes the contribution of localized flow regions to the global eigendynamics. It is calculated in a simple manner as the local point-wise inner product between the time derivative of the direct flow state and an adjoint mode. This study demonstrates for two canonical examples, the Ginzburg-Landau equation and the wake of a circular cylinder, how an analysis based on the endogeneity may be used for a physical discussion of the mechanisms that drive a global instability. The results are shown to be consistent with earlier 'wavemaker' definitions found in the literature, but the present formalism enables a more detailed discussion: a clear distinction is made between oscillation frequency and growth rate, and individual contributions from the various terms of the <b>flow</b> <b>operator</b> can be isolated and separately discussed.

40|$|The {{visualization}} of stationary and time-dependent flow {{is an important}} and challenging topic in scientific visualization. Its aim is to represent transport phenomena governed by vector fields in an intuitively understandable way. In this paper, we review the use of methods based on partial differential equations (PDEs) to postprocess flow datasets {{for the purpose of}} visualization. This connects flow visualization with image processing and mathematical multi-scale models. We introduce the concepts of <b>flow</b> <b>operators</b> and scale-space and explain their use in modeling post processing methods for flow data. Based on this framework, we present several classes of PDE-based visualization methods: anisotropic linear diffusion for stationary flow; transport and diffusion for non-stationary flow; continuous clustering based on phase-separation; and an algebraic clustering of a matrix-encoded <b>flow</b> <b>operator.</b> We illustrate the presented classes of methods with results obtained from concrete flow applications, using datasets in 2 D, flows on curved surfaces, and volumetric 3 D fields. ...|$|R

Data of the study are obtained from five different traffic circles in İzmir. The results show that when calculating the heavy vehicle adjustment factor (fHV), different PCE values should be used for minor and <b>major</b> <b>flows.</b> Using the same PCE value for both kind of flows may lead engineers to overdesign or make inadequate designs.

From a topological standpoint, {{the connection}} {{has recently been}} made between these cell complexes and the Morse theory of distance functions. In particular, in the generic setting, algorithms have been proposed to compute the flow complex - the stable and unstable manifolds associated to the critical points of the distance function to a point set. As algorithms ignoring degenerate cases and numerical issues are bound to fail on general inputs, this paper develops the first complete and robust algorithm to compute the flow complex. First, we present complete algorithms for the <b>flow</b> <b>operator,</b> unraveling a delicate interplay between the degenerate cases of Delaunay and those which are flow specific.
