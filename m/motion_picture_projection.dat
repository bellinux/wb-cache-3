5000|$|Silver {{lenticular}} screens, {{while no}} longer employed {{as the standard}} for <b>motion</b> <b>picture</b> <b>projection,</b> have come back into use as they are ideally suited for modern polarized 3-D projection.

As many 3-D technologies in use today depend upon maintaining the polarization of the images to be presented to each eye, the reflecting surface needs to be metallic rather than dielectric.|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of the cinema star, according to Richard DeCordova, is intimately linked with {{the decline of the}} allure of the apparatus of <b>motion</b> <b>picture</b> <b>projection.</b> Until about 1907, the focus of attention was on the technical feat of displaying images and stories on the screen. Most of early cinema was documentary in nature, with aspects of everyday life, circus performances and sporting events depicted on-screen. This changed somewhat because of the constant need for new and interesting (at least previously unseen) film product. The early connection of film to the craft of illusionism and magic {{can be seen in the}} films of Georges Melies, an illusionist turned film-maker, and in the position of the exhibition of films as a type of novelty act in vaudeville theaters. 3 In both cases, the enigmatic quality of the production was related not,so much to the plot as to how the images were created and juxtaposed. Early films (pre- 1907), according to DeCordova, could be characterized by their close connection to 2 ̆ 7 action 2 ̆ 7 and movement. The construction of the film celebrity emerged only after an initial decade of exhibition. It is part of traditional - although now challenged - film history that the large production houses, such as Biograph, impeded the development of the star by not releasing the real names of the actors involved in any film...|$|E

40|$|This {{essay is}} drawn from a book {{manuscript}} that examines Ralph Ellison’s life-long preoccupation with time and concomitant pursuit of a literature of immanence. In it, I illustrate how Ellison’s engagements with Bergsonian philosophy, Nietzschean cosmology, cybernetic theory, and transhistorical inquiry are inseparable from his ongoing efforts to trouble the Newtonian construct of universal time. Whether it’s in his early short stories, his 1952 masterpiece Invisible Man, his music criticism, or his unfinished tome posthumously published as Three Days Before the Shooting…, Ellison routinely turns to optic and sonic technologies to enact performative critiques of a still-hegemonic view of temporality born of the Enlightenment and maintained {{by the forces of}} capitalist acceleration and globalization. As he interrogates the forms of subjectivity that spatialized time reifies, Ellison constructs an alternative durational framework in which individuality and democracy, like emergent temporalities, are always becoming, immanent and inter-implicated. Ellison’s remedies for the order progressive history imposes upon the present, I contend, directly address the time that history adulterates by reclaiming the very technologies through which linear time is formalized. As an integral part of this larger work, “Rhopographic Photography and Atemporal Cinema” specifically addresses Ellison’s Bergsonian ekphrastic references to still photography and <b>motion</b> <b>picture</b> <b>projection</b> in his ultimately unfinished second novel and illustrates how Ellison’s own evolving photographic compositions, represented by the Polaroid photographs he took between 1966 and 1994, inform his temporal theorizing...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{undertakes}} {{an examination}} of theories describing the generation of meaning in various forms of representation, with specific reference to literary texts, photography and cinema. Proceeding from Derrida's claim that all signification may be classed as a general form of Writing, I consider the consequences of analysing the individual forms of representation from within a general system. The classical representation of self-presence in speech is examined, and the metaphysical notions derived from the apparent proximity of voice to thought, {{on the basis of}} instantaneous production, are challenged. As a result, the claims regarding presence and atemporality in the analogical representation of the photograph and the <b>motion</b> <b>picture</b> <b>projection</b> are critically examined; and the closure of mediation and meaning in the speech/writing and author/text hierarchies is subjected to deconstructionist analysis. Text theory often acknowledges Lacanian psychoanalysis, and Lacan's theory of the signification of desire is evaluated for its relationship to traditional models of representation. The Lacanian influence in Barthes's work is traced through the notion of textual desire developed in SIZ, and Barthes's claims regarding the meaning of myth and code are examined for their erasure of textual mediation. With the conclusion that claims to "truth" and the original encounter of "presence" in representation are founded on erasure and the privileging of secondary phenomena, the thesis incorporates examples of texts, such as Desperately Seeking Susan, which evoke the traditionally elided material; because the label "feminine" is usually applied to the excluded features of representation, the contemporary work in this area often takes a feminist approach, challenging the phallogocentric tradition of Western society...|$|E
