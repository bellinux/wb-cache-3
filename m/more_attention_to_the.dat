Rickey, an executive for baseball's Brooklyn Dodgers, convinced Brown to schedule a late-season road trip during which Cleveland would play three teams in eight days: the New York Yankees, the Los Angeles Dons and the San Francisco 49ers. The plan {{was part of an}} effort to bring <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> AAFC and help attendance by sending its most successful team on a cross-country road trip, a strategy that had worked in baseball.|$|E

Close to 200,000 people attended the event, displacing traditional celebrations that had normally been held at Trinity Church. However, following several years of fireworks shows, Ochs wanted a bigger spectacle at the building to draw <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> area. The newspaper's chief electrician, Walter F. Palmer, suggested using a time ball, after seeing one used on the nearby Western Union Building.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{solution}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> above issues. Retaining the information acquisition mode and communication network of smart grid, {{this paper presents}} a coordinated backup protection (CBP) scheme and corresponding protection configuration principles. It includes coordinated substation protection and regional master substation protection. Coordinated substation protection pays <b>more</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coordination and cooperation among different IEDs and substations, and works as the nearby backup protection. Compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> existing protection schemes, distributed IED has advantages in terms of functional support, information utilization, and achieving higher protection reliability. Master substation protection mainly analyzes regional comprehensive information and works as the remote backup protection. Considering the likelihood of insufficient state measurements, an integrated MS protection based on centralized searching method is proposed in master substation protection.|$|R

25|$|For instance, Matthew pays far <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> name of {{the child}} and its {{theological}} implications than the actual birth event itself. According to Karl Rahner the evangelists show little interest in synchronizing the episodes of the birth or subsequent life of Jesus with the secular history of the age. As a result, modern scholars do not use much of the birth narratives for historical information. Nevertheless, they are considered to contain some useful biographical information: Jesus being born near the end of Herod's reign and his father being named Joseph are considered historically plausible.|$|E

Lynch, a young, blonde, white woman, received far more media coverage than Johnson (a black woman and a single mother) and Piestewa (a Hopi from an impoverished background, and also a single mother), with media critics suggesting that the media gave <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> woman with whom audiences supposedly more readily identify.|$|E
25|$|According to Matković, after 1937 Pavelić paid <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ustaše in Yugoslavia than elsewhere, {{since the}} emigrants had become passive after the assassination. In 1938 he {{instructed}} the Ustaše to form stations in Yugoslav towns. The fall of Stojadinović's {{government and the}} creation of the Banovina of Croatia in 1939 further increased Ustaše activity; they founded Uzdanica (Hope), a savings co-operative. Under Uzdanica, Ustaše founded Ustaše University Headquarters and the illegal association Matija Gubec. However, Pavlowitch observes that Pavelić had few contacts with the Ustaše within Yugoslavia, and that his esteemed position within the Ustaše was partly due to his isolation in Italy.|$|E
