5|$|Although the overtures to Orphée aux enfers and La belle Hélene {{are well}} known and {{frequently}} recorded, the scores usually performed and recorded were not composed by Offenbach, but were arranged by Carl Binder and Eduard Haensch, respectively, for the Vienna premieres of the two works.

5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that aposematism and mimicry is less evident in marine invertebrates than terrestrial insects because predation is a more intense selective force for many insects, which also disperse as adults rather than as larvae and have <b>much</b> <b>shorter</b> generation times. Further, {{there is evidence that}} fish predators such as blueheads may adapt to visual cues more rapidly than do birds, making aposematism less effective.|$|E
5|$|It {{originally}} {{started as}} a massive loop around the Chicago area, however it has retained its current, <b>much</b> <b>shorter</b> route ever since 1937. During the 1990s, it {{became the subject of}} much concern for local residents regarding expansion which slowed down any progress for capacity improvement. By the late 2000s, the delays have come and gone and it has emerged as a state route that has been largely modernized to deal with heavy traffic.|$|E

5|$|On Stranger Tides broke many {{box office}} records upon release, and it {{stands as the}} 23rd-highest-grossing film of all time {{worldwide}} when not adjusting for inflation. Critical reviews were mixed, with the film receiving criticism over its writing, directing, excessiveness and lack of originality; positive mentions were given on the acting, action sequences, music, visuals and the running time for being <b>much</b> <b>shorter</b> than the previous two films. A sequel, titled , was released in 2017.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{differences}} between the digestive systems of sharks and mammals is that sharks have <b>much</b> <b>shorter</b> intestines. This short length is achieved by the spiral valve with multiple turns within a single short section instead of a long tube-like intestine. The valve provides a long surface area, requiring food to circulate inside the short gut until fully digested, when remaining waste products pass into the cloaca.|$|E

50|$|Kalinga Magha's geopolitical {{impact is}} {{reflected}} in the changing language of the Culavamsa as well. The traditional divisions of Sri Lanka, into Rajarata, Dhakkinadesa, and Ruhuna, first undergo a change of names (Rajarata becomes Pathithadesa, Dhakkinadesa becomes Mayarata), and then slip into obsolescence altogether. Their successor kingdoms tended to be geographically smaller and centred on a strong citadel-capital, such as Yapahuwa or Gampola; they also tended to be <b>much</b> <b>short</b> lived, like Sitawaka.|$|R
5|$|The 98th Regiment of Foot, {{raised in}} 1824 in Chichester, had a <b>much</b> <b>shorter</b> history, {{but like the}} 64th had spent the {{majority}} of its time overseas spending a long time in South Africa before seeing action in China in the First Anglo-Chinese (or Opium) War and India on the North West Frontier. It was based in Afghanistan when the amalgamation occurred.|$|E
5|$|The second {{iteration}} of M-10 {{was designated}} in 1929 on a <b>much</b> <b>shorter</b> {{segment of the}} original M-10 through the Flint area, serving as a business connection for the city as the through route, US10, bypassed it on the east. It was later redesignated as Business US 10 (Bus. US10) in 1941, and then as Bus. M-54 in 1962 before being turned back to local control in 1974.|$|E

5|$|Women {{are more}} prone to UTIs than men because, in females, the urethra is <b>much</b> <b>shorter</b> and closer to the anus. As a woman's {{estrogen}} levels decrease with menopause, her risk of urinary tract infections increases due to the loss of protective vaginal flora. Additionally, vaginal atrophy that can sometimes occur after menopause is associated with recurrent urinary tract infections.|$|E
5|$|A {{glass screen}} {{separated}} {{the first class}} platform and circulating area from the platform and circulating area for third class passengers. The third class section was entered from the secondary entrance in Newnham Terrace, and was more sparsely furnished and not equipped with lifts. From the Newnham Terrace entrance a staircase led to a single communal waiting room on the first floor, and to the third class platform on the second floor, <b>much</b> <b>shorter</b> than the first class platform.|$|E
5|$|As Threni was {{intended}} for concert rather than liturgical use, Stravinsky chose the text freely from the early chapters of the Book of Lamentations. It has three movements: the large central movement is surrounded by two <b>much</b> <b>shorter</b> ones. Ernst Krenek composed a setting of the Lamentations in 1942, and Stravinsky acknowledged {{that it might have}} influenced him. He considered it less likely that works by Renaissance composers, including Tallis, Byrd and Palestrina, had influenced him, although he had studied such music.|$|E

All results for (anti) hypertriton lifetime by two-body decay channel of 3 He + π for Au+Au collision at RHIC, Pb+Pb collision at LHC and Li + C collisions at GSI show a significant short lifetime in comparison with lifetime of free Λ decays.

60|$|The time I spent {{upon the}} island is still so horrible a thought to me, that I must pass it lightly over. In all the books I have read of people cast away, they had either their pockets full of tools, or a chest of things would be thrown upon the beach along with them, as if on purpose. My case was very different. I had nothing in my pockets but money and Alan's silver button; and being inland bred, I was as <b>much</b> <b>short</b> of {{knowledge}} as of means.|$|R

5|$|Blast {{furnaces}} {{are currently}} rarely used in copper smelting, but modern lead smelting blast furnaces are <b>much</b> <b>shorter</b> than iron blast furnaces and are rectangular in shape. The overall shaft height is around 5 to 6 m. Modern lead blast furnaces {{are constructed using}} water-cooled steel or copper jackets for the walls, and have no refractory linings in the side walls. The base of the furnace is a hearth of refractory material (bricks or castable refractory). Lead blast furnaces are often open-topped rather than having the charging bell used in iron blast furnaces.|$|E
5|$|Diptera were {{traditionally}} {{broken down}} into two suborders, Nematocera and Brachycera, distinguished by the differences in antennae. The Nematocera are recognized by their elongated bodies and many-segmented, often feathery antennae as represented by mosquitoes and crane flies. The Brachycera have rounder bodies and <b>much</b> <b>shorter</b> antennae. Subsequent studies have identified the Nematocera as being non-monophyletic with modern phylogenies placing the Brachycera within grades of groups formerly placed in the Nematocera. The construction of a phylogenetic tree {{has been the subject}} of ongoing research. The following cladogram is based on the FLYTREE project.|$|E
5|$|Four {{different}} types of male flowers exist. On {{the basis of these}} flower types, the genus has often been split into four genera—a more narrowly defined Attalea, Orbignya, Maximiliana and Scheelea. The species sometimes referred to Orbignya have coiled anthers, while the other groups have straight ones. The petals of those placed in Maximiliana are <b>much</b> <b>shorter</b> than the stamens, while those placed in Scheelea and a more narrowly defined Attalea have petals that are longer than the stamens. Five species do not fit easily into any of these groups; this fact has been used as an argument in favour of considering this group a single genus.|$|E
5000|$|The film {{failed at}} the box office and {{received}} mixed reviews, with the cinematography, the use of Mendelssohn's music, and the dance sequences being highly praised. Although James Cagney was acclaimed for his performance, Warner Bros. was criticized by film critic Richard Watts, Jr. for [...] "weakening" [...] enough to cast an actor [...] "whose performance is not <b>much</b> <b>short</b> of fatal" [...] (i.e. box-office favorite Dick Powell, then in his [...] "Hollywood crooner" [...] phase, who reportedly realized he was completely wrong for the role of Lysander and asked to be taken off the film, to no avail).|$|R

60|$|Finite then, and infinite, {{being by}} the mind looked on as MODIFICATIONS of {{expansion}} and duration, {{the next thing}} to be considered, is,--HOW THE MIND COMES BY THEM. As {{for the idea of}} finite, there is no great difficulty. The obvious portions of extension that affect our senses, carry with them into the mind the idea of finite: and the ordinary periods of succession, whereby we measure time and duration, as hours, days, and years, are bounded lengths. The difficulty is, how we come by those BOUNDLESS IDEAS of eternity and immensity; since the objects we converse with come so <b>much</b> <b>short</b> of any approach or proportion to that largeness.|$|R
