40|$|Mouse {{epidermal}} <b>melanoblasts</b> preferentially proliferated from disaggregated {{epidermal cell}} suspensions derived from newborn mouse skin in serum-free melanoblast-defined medium (MDM). After 14 d, almost all keratinocytes that existed predominantly {{in the early}} stage of primary culture died, and pure cultures of <b>melanoblasts</b> were obtained. Epidermal <b>melanoblasts</b> dramatically increased in number in MDMDF consisting of MDM supplemented with dibutyryl adenosine 3 ′: 5 ′-cyclic monophosphate (DBcAMP) and {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (bFGF). Epidermal melanocytes increased in number in MDMD consisting of MDM supplemented with DBcAMP. On the other hand, epidermal melanocytes were induced to differentiate in MDMM consisting of MDM supplemented with α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). Pure cultured primary <b>melanoblasts</b> or melanocytes in MDMDF or MDMD were further cultured with MDMDF or MDMD supplemented with endothelin (ET) - 1, - 2, or - 3 from 14 d. A dramatic {{increase in the number of}} <b>melanoblasts</b> or melanocytes was observed after 7 d; however, no increase in the number of <b>melanoblasts</b> or melanocytes was observed in the absence of ET- 1, - 2, or - 3. The increase in the number of <b>melanoblasts</b> or melanocytes was comparable with that of <b>melanoblasts</b> or melanocytes cocultured with secondary keratinocytes in MDMDF or MDMD. Also, pure cultured primary <b>melanoblasts</b> in MDM were further cultured with MDMM supplemented with ET- 1, - 2, or - 3 from 14 d. A dramatic increase in the percentage of melanocytes in the melanoblast-melanocyte population was observed after 7 d; however, no increase in the percentage of melanocytes was observed in the absence of ET- 1, - 2, or - 3. The increase was comparable with that of melanocytes cocultured with secondary keratinocytes in MDMM. Moreover, anti-ET- 1, - 2, and - 3 antibodies inhibited both the proliferation of <b>melanoblasts</b> or melanocytes in MDMDF or MDMD and the differentiation of melanocytes in MDMM in primary culture. These results suggest that ET- 1, - 2, and - 3 are one member of the keratinocyte-derived factors that are involved in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of mouse epidermal melanocytes in primary culture...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{recessive}} patchwork (pwk) {{mutation in}} mice {{is associated with}} a unique hair follicle phenotype. Mice homozygous for patchwork exhibit a variegated coat containing a mixture of white and fully pigmented hairs, but no partially pigmented hairs. We have investigated the etiology of this mutation. We report here that the white hairs result from the lack of melanocytes in the follicle. As indicated by the coat color pattern of patchworkalbino chimeras, the target cell for the patchwork mutation is the melanocyte and/or its precursor. Examination of these chimeras also suggested that patchwork does not act in a cell-autonomous manner. The colonization of the skin by <b>melanoblasts</b> in patchwork embryos was studied using a lacZ transgene. <b>Melanoblasts</b> die by apoptosis in hair follicles from homozygous pwk/pwk fetuses starting at embryonic day 18. 5, indicating that patchwork acts from this stage. The combination of pwk and KitW-ei, a mutation responsible for a reduced number of <b>melanoblasts</b> in the hair follicle, suggested that pwk gene product is necessary for low numbers of <b>melanoblasts</b> to survive and differentiate in the hair follicle from embryonic day 18. 5 onward. We conclude that the pigmented hairs on the coat of pwk/pwk mice may be attributed to a community effect among <b>melanoblasts</b> in the hair follicle at the end of embryogenesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{individual}} molecular pathways downstream of Cdc 42, Rac, and Rho GTPases {{are well}} documented, {{but we know}} surprisingly little about how these pathways are coordinated when cells move in a complex environment in vivo. In the developing embryo, <b>melanoblasts</b> originating from the neural crest must traverse the dermis to reach the epidermis of the skin and hair follicles. We previously established that Rac 1 signals via Scar/WAVE and Arp 2 / 3 to effect pseudopod extension and migration of <b>melanoblasts</b> in skin. Here we show that RhoA is redundant in the melanocyte lineage but that Cdc 42 coordinates multiple motility systems independent of Rac 1. Similar to Rac 1 knockouts, Cdc 42 null mice displayed a severe loss of pigmentation, and <b>melanoblasts</b> showed cell-cycle progression, migration, and cytokinesis defects. However, unlike Rac 1 knockouts, Cdc 42 null <b>melanoblasts</b> were elongated and displayed large, bulky pseudopods with dynamic actin bursts. Despite assuming an elongated shape usually associated with fast mesenchymal motility, Cdc 42 knockout <b>melanoblasts</b> migrated slowly and inefficiently in the epidermis, with nearly static pseudopods. Although much of the basic actin machinery was intact, Cdc 42 null cells lacked the ability to polarize their Golgi and coordinate motility systems for efficient movement. Loss of Cdc 42 de-coupled three main systems: actin assembly via the formin FMNL 2 and Arp 2 / 3, active myosin-II localization, and integrin-based adhesion dynamics...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMelanoblasts are a {{population}} of neural crest-derived cells that generate the pigment-producing cells of our body. Defective <b>melanoblast</b> development and function underlies many disorders including Waardenburg syndrome and melanoma. Understanding the genetic regulation of <b>melanoblast</b> development will help elucidate the etiology {{of these and other}} neurocristopathies. Here we demonstrate that Magoh, a component of the exon junction complex, is required for normal <b>melanoblast</b> development. Magoh haploinsufficient mice are hypopigmented and exhibit robust genetic interactions with the transcription factor, Sox 10. These phenotypes are caused by a marked reduction in <b>melanoblast</b> number beginning at mid-embryogenesis. Strikingly, while Magoh haploinsufficiency severely reduces epidermal melanoblasts, it does not significantly affect the number of dermal melanoblasts. These data indicate Magoh impacts <b>melanoblast</b> development by disproportionately affecting expansion of epidermal <b>melanoblast</b> populations. We probed the cellular basis for <b>melanoblast</b> reduction and discovered that Magoh mutant melanoblasts do not undergo increased apoptosis, but instead are arrested in mitosis. Mitotic arrest is evident in both Magoh haploinsufficient embryos and in Magoh siRNA treated melanoma cell lines. Together our findings indicate that Magoh-regulated proliferation of melanoblasts in the dermis may be critical for production of epidermally-bound melanoblasts. Our results point to a central role for Magoh in melanocyte development...|$|E

Adamts 20 mutations in belted (bt) mice cause white spotting of the dorsal and ventral torso, indicative of defective neural crest (NC) -derived <b>melanoblast</b> development. The expression pattern of Adamts 20 in dermal mesenchymal cells adjacent to migrating melanoblasts led us to initially propose that Adamts 20 regulated <b>melanoblast</b> migration. However, using a Dct-LacZ transgene to track <b>melanoblast</b> development, we determined that melanoblasts were distributed normally in whole mount E 12. 5 bt/bt embryos, but were specifically reduced in the trunk of E 13. 5 bt/bt embryos due to a seven-fold higher rate of apoptosis. The <b>melanoblast</b> defect was exacerbated in newborn skin and embryos from bt/bt animals that were also haploinsufficient for Adamts 9, a close homolog of Adamts 20, indicating that these metalloproteases functionally overlap in <b>melanoblast</b> development. We identified two potential mechanisms by which Adamts 20 may regulate <b>melanoblast</b> survival. First, skin explant cultures demonstrated that Adamts 20 was required for melanoblasts to respond to soluble Kit ligand (sKitl). In support of this requirement, bt/bt;Kit tm 1 Alf /+ and bt/bt;Kitl Sl /+ mice exhibited synergistically increased spotting. Second, ADAMTS 20 cleaved the aggregating proteoglycan versican in vitro and was necessary for versican processing in vivo, raising the possibility that versican can participate in <b>melanoblast</b> development.

40|$|Background: Metastases are {{the major}} cause of death from melanoma, a skin cancer which has the fastest rising {{incidence}} of any malignancy in the Western world. Molecular pathways that drive <b>melanoblast</b> migration in development are believed to underpin the movement and ultimately the metastasis of melanoma. Aims: In this thesis we use genetically modified mice models to characterise two novel anticancer targets, P-Rex 1 and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Embryonic <b>melanoblast</b> migration is compared with cancer outcomes for each genetic modification. Results: Mice lacking P-Rex 1, a Rac-specific Rho GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), have a <b>melanoblast</b> migration defect during development evidenced by a white belly. These P-Rex 1 -/- mice are resistant to metastasis when crossed to a murine model of melanoma, an effect specifically channeled through loss of P-Rex 1 GEF activity. FAK disruption compromises <b>melanoblast</b> cell numbers and migration in development, but has no long-term effect on melanocyte homeostasis. FAK-deleted mice have a divergent role in melanomagenesis, delaying primary melanoma onset whilst promoting metastasis following disease onset. Conclusions: We conclude that P-Rex 1 and FAK play important roles in <b>melanoblast</b> embryology and melanoma development and progression. Both P-Rex 1 and FAK represent interesting therapeutic targets {{for the treatment of}} cancer...|$|E

In melanogenesis, <b>melanoblasts</b> migrate from the neural crest to their appropriate locations in the epidermis. <b>Melanoblasts</b> express the KIT receptor, and it is believed that SCF guides these cells to their terminal locations.

40|$|Microscopic {{features}} of <b>melanoblasts</b> and melanocytes were studied in skin and oral mucosa of Labrador retriever fetuses (Canis familiaris). Earliest <b>melanoblasts</b> were demonstrable only after treatment with ammoniacal silver nitrate (ASN) in the primordial dermis of the head, thorax, and the abdomen of 25 to 28 mm fetuses. The <b>melanoblasts</b> were most numerous {{in the lower}} two-thirds of the primordial dermis in contact with or near blood vessels. The frequent contact or close association of <b>melanoblasts</b> with blood vessels suggests that the cells migrate along blood vessels in their journey from the neural crest to their destination in the epidermis. Dendritic dermal melanocytes first appear in the 58 mm fetus. Earliest epidermal melanocytes were demonstrated in vertical sections and full thickness skin “spreads” of untreated, dopa-treated and ASN-treated tissue, Only scattered epidermal melanocytes were demonstrated in 25 to 28 mm fetuses.

Here we show {{that the development of}} the dorsal neural tube-derived <b>melanoblasts</b> in turtle Trachemys scripta is regulated by similar mechanisms as in other amniotes, but significantly later in development, during the second phase of turtle trunk neural crest emigration. The development of <b>melanoblasts</b> coincided with a morphological change in the dorsal neural tube between stages mature G 15 and G 16. The <b>melanoblasts</b> delaminated and gathered in the carapacial staging area above the neural tube at G 16, and differentiated into pigment-forming melanocytes during in vitro culture. The Mitf-positive <b>melanoblasts</b> were not restricted to the dorsolateral pathway as in birds and mammals but were also present medially through the somites similarly to ectothermal anamniotes. This matched a lack of environmental barrier dorsal and lateral to neural tube and the somites that is normally formed by PNA-binding proteins that block entry to medial pathways. PNA-binding proteins may also participate in the patterning of the carapacial pigmentation as both the migratory neural crest cells and pigment localized only to PNA-free areas...|$|R
40|$|Vertebrate pigment {{cells are}} derived from neural crest, a tissue that also forms most of the {{peripheral}} nervous system {{and a variety of}} ectomesenchymal cell types, formation of pigment cells from multipotential neural crest cells involves a number of common developmental processes. Pigment cells must be specified; their migration, proliferation, and survival must be controlled and they must differentiate to the final pigment cell type. We previously reported a large set of embryonic mutations that affect pigment cell development from neural crest (R. N. Kelsh et al., 1996, Development 123, 369 - 389). Based on distinctions in pigment cell appearance between mutants, we proposed hypotheses as to the process of pigment cell development affected by each mutation. Here we describe the cloning and expression of an early zebrafish <b>melanoblast</b> marker, dopachrome tautomerase. We used this marker to test predictions about <b>melanoblast</b> number and pattern in mutant embryos, including embryos homozygous for mutations in the colourless, sparse, touchdown, sunbleached, punkt, blurred, fade out, weiss, sandy, and albino genes. We showed that in homozygous mutants for all loci except colourless and sparse, <b>melanoblast</b> number and pattern are normal. colourless mutants have a pronounced decrease in <b>melanoblast</b> cell number from the earliest stages and also show poor <b>melanoblast</b> differentiation and migration. Although sparse mutants show normal numbers of melanoblasts initially, their number is reduced later. Furthermore, their distribution indicates a defect in <b>melanoblast</b> dispersal.

40|$|It {{is still}} unknown why dermal melanophores {{disappear}} during larval development, and why no or very few epidermal melanophores appear {{during and after}} metamorphosis, in Xenopus laevis showing periodic albinism (ap). To elucidate these points, we investigated (1) the occurrence of depigmentation in mutant (ap/ap) melanophores during in vitro proliferation and (2) the incidence of melanophore differentiation from mutant <b>melanoblasts</b> in the skin in vitro. During in vitro proliferation of mutant melanophores, ap-type melanosomes decreased in number gradually and instead the number of premelanosomes increased in the cells, which caused depigmentation at the light microscopic level in the culture. Depigmentation was observed only in mutant melanophores, and not in wild-type (+/+) melanophores. These results suggest that autonomous depigmentation of mutant dermal melanophores {{is the cause of}} the disappearance of these cells in vivo. Dopa-positive <b>melanoblasts</b> were demonstrated in both wild-type and mutant skins. However, the <b>melanoblasts</b> of metamorphosed mutant froglets did not differentiate in vitro, while those of wild-type froglets did.

40|$|During embryogenesis, <b>melanoblasts</b> proliferate and migrate ventrally {{through the}} {{developing}} dermis and epidermis as single cells. Targeted deletion of Rac 1 in <b>melanoblasts</b> during embryogenesis causes defects in migration, cell-cycle progression, and cytokinesis. Rac 1 null cells migrate markedly less efficiently, but surprisingly, global steering, crossing the dermal/epidermal junction, and homing to hair follicles occur normally. <b>Melanoblasts</b> navigate in the epidermis using {{two classes of}} protrusion: short stubs and long pseudopods. Short stubs are distinct from blebs and are driven by actin assembly but are independent of Rac 1, Arp 2 / 3 complex, myosin, or microtubules. Rac 1 positively regulates the frequency of initiation of long pseudopods, which promote migration speed and directional plasticity. Scar/WAVE and Arp 2 / 3 complex drive actin assembly for long pseudopod extension, which also depends on microtubule dynamics. Myosin contractility balances the extension of long pseudopods by effecting retraction and allowing force generation for movement through the complex 3 D epidermal environment...|$|R
40|$|Wnt/β-catenin {{signaling}} controls multiple {{steps of}} neural crest development, ranging from neural crest induction, lineage decisions, to differentiation. In mice, conditional β-catenin inactivation in premigratory neural crest cells abolishes both sensory neuron and melanocyte formation. Intriguingly, {{the generation of}} melanocytes is also prevented by activation of β-catenin in the premigratory neural crest, which promotes sensory neurogenesis {{at the expense of}} other neural crest derivatives. This raises the question of how Wnt/β-catenin signaling regulates the formation of distinct lineages from the neural crest. Using various Cre lines to conditionally activate β-catenin in neural crest cells at different developmental stages, we show that neural crest cell fate decisions in vivo are subject to temporal control by Wnt/β-catenin. Unlike in premigratory neural crest, β-catenin activation in migratory neural crest cells promotes the formation of ectopic <b>melanoblasts,</b> while the production of most other lineages is suppressed. Ectopic <b>melanoblasts</b> emerge at sites of neural crest target structures and in many tissues usually devoid of neural crest-derived cells. β-catenin activation at later stages in glial progenitors or in <b>melanoblasts</b> does not lead to surplus <b>melanoblasts,</b> indicating a narrow time window of Wnt/β-catenin responsiveness during neural crest cell migration. Thus, neural crest cells appear to be multipotent in vivo both before and after emigration from the neural tube but adapt their response to extracellular signals in a temporally controlled manner...|$|R
40|$|We aim to {{evaluate}} environmental and genetic {{effects on the}} expansion/proliferation of committed single cells during embryonic development, using melanoblasts as a paradigm to model this phenomenon. Melanoblasts are {{a specific type of}} cell that display extensive cellular proliferation during development. However, the events controlling <b>melanoblast</b> expansion are still poorly understood due to insufficient knowledge concerning their number and distribution in the various skin compartments. We show that <b>melanoblast</b> expansion is tightly controlled both spatially and temporally, with little variation between embryos. We established a mathematical model reflecting the main cellular mechanisms involved in <b>melanoblast</b> expansion, including proliferation and migration from the dermis to epidermis. In association with biological information, the model allows the calculation of doubling times for melanoblasts, revealing that dermal and epidermal melanoblasts have short but different doubling times. Moreover, the number of trunk founder melanoblasts at E 8. 5 was estimated to be 16, a population impossible to count by classical biological approaches. We also assessed the importance of the genetic background by studying gain- and loss-of-function β-catenin mutants in the melanocyte lineage. We found that any alteration of β-catenin activity, whether positive or negative, reduced both dermal and epidermal <b>melanoblast</b> proliferation. Finally, we determined that the pool of dermal melanoblasts remains constant in wild-type and mutant embryos during development, implying that specific control mechanisms associated with cell division ensure half of the cells at each cell division to migrate from the dermis to the epidermis. Modeling <b>melanoblast</b> expansion revealed novel links between cell division, cell localization within the embryo and appropriate feedback control through β-catenin...|$|E
40|$|The DOPA-reaction {{was used}} to {{identify}} tyrosinase in the nucleus and cytoplasm of the neural crest <b>melanoblast</b> of Taricha torosa, the California newt. In this urodele there is a nuclear DOPA-positive response during the normal embryonic development from the late blastula stage to {{the nucleus of the}} early melanocyte. During the gastrula stages, all nuclei of this newt are DOPA-positive. This positive nuclear response fades away after the formation of the neural crest, save in the melanoblasts. The only cells that give a positive DOPA marking in the cytoplasm are the melanoblasts. This cytoplasmic reaction appears while the <b>melanoblast</b> nucleus still gives a DOPA-positive reaction. Tyrosinase activity, as marked by unlabeled DOPA, has ceased in the fully mature melanocyte. The red nuclei, seen in some of the animals in the maturing melanocyte and adjacent tissues, may be in the hallachrome stage of melanin formation. There is a diffuse distribution of DOPA reactivity in the resting nucleus, and an adherence of the DOPA-marking in the region of the dividing chromosomes in the mitosis of DOPA-positive nuclei of the <b>melanoblast.</b> These observations suggest that tyrosinase may be among the chromosomally bound enzymes of the chromatin space.

Unlike the melanocytes that are confined to the integument in other vertebrates, melanocytes in Silky Fowl can reach the ventral regions of the embryos owing to differences in gene expression {{in the process of}} melanoblasts migration. In this study, we used microarray profiling to identify differences in gene expression between White Leghorn and Silky Fowl. Differential expression of 2517 microarray probes (P 2) was observed in Silky Fowl compared to White Leghorn. After filtration by cluster analysis, functional annotation and pathway analysis, eight differentially expressed genes were identified to be closely related to the development of melanocytes. Moreover, differences in expression of immune genes were also detected between Silky Fowl and White Leghorn. The differentially expressed genes associated with melanocyte development were verified by q-PCR, and results were highly consistent with the microarray data. The genes with significantly altered expression involved in <b>melanoblast</b> migration and development suggested that different microenvironments resulted in the abnormal <b>melanoblast</b> migration in Silky Fowl, although there were no big differences in <b>melanoblast</b> development between these two breeds.

40|$|SUMMARY Pigmentation {{and eyes}} are often lost in cave-adapted animals. Although the {{mechanisms}} of eye degeneration are beginning to be understood, {{little is known about}} the evolutionary and developmental processes involved in pigment cell regression. In teleost embryos, a population of neural crest cells migrates into the body wall and differentiates into melanophores, xanthophores, and iridophores. All three pigment cell types are present in the eyed surface-dwelling form (surface fish) of the teleost Astyanax mexicanus. However, melanophores are absent or substantially reduced in number in various derived populations of the conspecific blind cave-dwelling form (cavefish). We show here that tyrosinase-positive <b>melanoblasts</b> are present in cavefish. DiI labeling revealed a population of trunk neural crest cells in cavefish embryos that migrate to locations normally occupied by differentiated melanophores. We also discovered a cell population in cavefish embryos and adults resembling <b>melanoblasts</b> in several features, including the ability to synthesize melanin when supplied with the tyrosinase substrate L-dopa. DiI-tyrosinase double-labeling and neural keel explant experiments showed that the tyrosinase-positive cells are derived from the neural crest. The number of <b>melanoblasts</b> varies in different adult cavefish populations relative to the extent of melanophore reduction. Although cavefish <b>melanoblasts</b> can synthesize melanin from exogenous L-dopa, they are unable to convert exogenous L-tyrosine to L-dopa and melanin. We conclude that pigment cell regression in cavefish is mediated by an evolutionary change late in melanogenesis that may involve an impediment in the ability to convert L-tyrosine to L-dopa and melanin...|$|R

We have used this model to study platelets, megakaryocytes and <b>melanoblasts</b> and we provide evidence that Lifeact-GFP is a useful reporter in these cell types ex vivo. In the case of platelets and megakaryocytes, these cells are not transfectable by traditional methods, so conditional activation of Lifeact allows the study of actin dynamics in these cells live. We studied <b>melanoblasts</b> in native skin explants from embryos, allowing the visualization of live actin dynamics during cytokinesis and migration. Our study revealed that <b>melanoblasts</b> lacking the small GTPase Rac 1 show a delay {{in the formation of}} new pseudopodia following cytokinesis that accounts for the previously reported cytokinesis delay in these cells.

40|$|The Notch/RBP-J pathway is {{involved}} in a variety of developmental processes and in tissue homeostasis.

For this purpose, we developed mice in which the RBP-J gene was conditionally ablated in the melanocyte lineage and used the Dct-lacZ reporter transgene to track melanocytes and their precursors in individual hair follicles. We determine that Notch/RBP-J-deficient <b>melanoblasts</b> are in reduced number within the hair follicle and gather within its lower permanent part.

Depigmented ‘belly spots’ in mice with mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase Kit are thought to represent a failure of this colonization, either due to impaired migration or proliferation. Tracing of single <b>melanoblast</b> clones, however, has revealed a diffuse distribution with high levels of axial mixing—hard to reconcile with directed migration. Here we construct an agent-based stochastic model calibrated by experimental measurements to investigate the formation of diffuse clones, chimeric stripes and belly spots.

40|$|The {{response}} of hair follicle melanoblasts to irradiation {{has been studied}} by two techniques at various stages of the hair growth cycle.

A large difference in sensitivity is evident between resting and growing follicles. This difference seems to vary with different strains of mice. The sensitivities of the <b>melanoblast</b> survival curves also vary considerably through the hair growth cycle. The most sensitive cells are the resting Go melanoblasts.

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of neural crest-derived melanocytes, {{as well as}} haematopoietic and germ cells, is affected by mutations of theKitandMgfgenes, which lead to dominant spotting (W) or steel (Sl) phenotypes. Mgfcodes for the ligand of the receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by theKitlocus. KitW-v, a point mutation exerting a dominant negative effect, causes a substantial reduction in tyrosine kinase activity of the Kit receptor and leads to a characteristic pigmentation phenotype, namely dilute coat colour and a white ventral and head spot with reduced pigmentation of the feet and tail in the heterozygous animal, as well as slight anaemia. Homozygous animals lack coat pigmentation and are severely anaemic and infertile. Dct is a marker for cells of the <b>melanoblast</b> lineage. In order to study these cells in detail we have generated transgenic mouse lines carrying thelacZreporter {{under the control of}} theDctpromoter and have used the embryonic expression of the reporter to identify early melanoblasts before they begin to produce pigment. Our transgenic lines have simplified the study of melanoblasts in the mouse embryo, and by crossing our mice withKitW-vmutants {{we have been able to}} identify the midgestation stages at which melanoblasts rely critically on Mgf/Kit interactions. We conclude that the survival of immature melanoblasts depends crucially upon Kit signalling up until E 11, and later in development Kit plays a vital role in <b>melanoblast</b> proliferation.

This strip of tissue is found along the dorsal midline of the embryo, and multipotent cells migrate down along the sides of the embryo, or through germ layers, to their ultimate destinations. Melanocyte stem cells are called <b>melanoblasts.</b> Conditions associated with abnormalities in the migration of <b>melanoblasts</b> are known collectively as piebaldism. Pigment cells of the iris pigment epithelium have a separate embryological origin. Piebaldism and amelanism are distinct conditions.|$|R
40|$|The {{enormous}} {{variety of}} pigmentation phenotypes in nature reflects {{a series of}} remarkable events that begin in the neural crest and end with the manufacture and distribution of pigment by mature melanocytes located in the epidermis and hair follicles. While the origins of <b>melanoblasts</b> from multipotent precursors in the neural crest is striking in itself, yet more so {{is the fact that}} these pioneer <b>melanoblasts</b> manage to undertake and survive their long migration, and in doing so proliferate and maintain their identity before ultimately arriving at their destination and undergoing differentiation. With the application of the powerful combination of genetics and molecular and cell biology the mystery surrounding the genesis of the melanocyte lineage is slowly being unravelled. At its heart is the powerful alliance between signal transduction and transcription that coordinates the program of gene expression that confers on a cell its identity, provides its passport for migration, and instructs it in the arts of survival and timely reproduction. The realization that the proliferation and migration of <b>melanoblasts</b> during development resembles closely the proliferation and metastasis of melanoma, a highly dangerous and increasingly common cancer, serves to highlight the value of the melanocyte system as a model for addressing key issues of general significance in both development and cancer...|$|R
40|$|Haploinsufficiency for the {{transcription}} factor SOX 10 {{is associated with}} the pigmentary deficiencies of Waardenburg syndrome (WS) and is modeled in Sox 10 haploinsufficient mice (Sox 10 LacZ/+). As genetic background affects WS severity in both humans and mice, we established an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen to identify modifiers that increase the phenotypic severity of Sox 10 LacZ/+ mice. Analysis of 230 pedigrees identified three modifiers, named modifier of Sox 10 neurocristopathies (Mos 1, Mos 2 and Mos 3). Linkage analysis confirmed their locations on mouse chromosomes 13, 4 and 3, respectively, within regions distinct from previously identified WS loci. Positional candidate analysis of Mos 1 identified a truncation mutation in a hedgehog(HH) -signaling mediator, GLI-Kruppel family member 3 (Gli 3). Complementation tests using a second allele of Gli 3 (Gli 3 Xt-J) confirmed that a null mutation of Gli 3 causes the increased hypopigmentation in Sox 10 LacZ/+;Gli 3 Mos 1 /+ double heterozygotes. Early <b>melanoblast</b> markers (Mitf, Sox 10, Dct, and Si) are reduced in Gli 3 Mos 1 /Mos 1 embryos, indicating that loss of GLI 3 signaling disrupts <b>melanoblast</b> specification. In contrast, mice expressing only the GLI 3 repressor have normal <b>melanoblast</b> specification, indicating that the full-length GLI 3 activator is not required for specification of neural crest to the melanocyte lineage. This study demonstrates the feasibility of sensitized screens to identify disease modifier loci and implicates GLI 3 and other HH signaling components as modifiers of human neurocristopathies...|$|E
40|$|Commitment to the {{melanocyte}} lineage {{is characterized}} by the onset of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (Mitf) expression. Mitf plays a fundamental role in melanocyte development, with mice lacking Mitf being entirely devoid of pigment cells. In the absence of functional Mitf protein, melanoblasts expressing Mitf mRNA disappear around 2 days after their first appearance either by apoptosis or by losing their identity and adopting an alternative cell fate. The role of Mitf must therefore be to regulate genes required for <b>melanoblast</b> survival, proliferation, or the maintenance of <b>melanoblast</b> identity. Yet to date, Mitf has been shown to regulate genes such as Tyrosinase, Tyrp- 1, and Dct, which are required for pigmentation, a differentiation-specific process. Because expression of these genes cannot account for the complete absence of pigment cells in Mitf-negative mice, Mitf must regulate the expression of other as yet uncharacterized genes. Here we provide several lines of evidence to suggest that Mitf may regulate the expression of the Tbx 2 transcription factor, a member of the T-box family of proteins implicated in the maintenance of cell identity. First, isolation and sequencing of the entire murine Tbx 2 gene revealed that the Tbx 2 promoter contains a full consensus Mitf recognition element; second, Mitf could bind the promoter in vitro and activate Tbx 2 expression in vivo in an E box-dependent fashion; and third, Tbx 2 is expressed in melanoma cell lines expressing Mitf, but not in a line in which Mitf expression was not detectable. Taken together, with the fact that Tbx 2 is expressed in Mitf-positive melanoblasts and melanocytes, but not in Mitf-negative <b>melanoblast</b> precursor cells, the evidence suggests that the Tbx 2 gene may represent one of the first known targets for Mitf that is not a gene involved directly in the manufacture of pigment...|$|E
40|$|Introduction In most homeothermic vertebrates, pigment {{cells are}} {{confined}} to the skin, since <b>melanoblast</b> is the only neural crest lineage that can migrate dorsolaterally, between the ectoderm into the derm. Silkie fowl, is a naturally occurring chicken mutant from common chicken, in which pigment cells occupy most connective tissues, given them a dramatic blue-black pigmentation. This occurs because melanoblasts continue to migrate, extensively dorsolateral and ventrally, since the natural tissue barriers, which normally restrain <b>melanoblast</b> migration, are not present in the Silkie fowl. Objectives The authors document, using macro and microscopic figures, the normal distribution of the melanic pigment in the Silkie fowl tissues. Material and Methods 2 adult Silkie fowls were necropsied and samples fixed in 10 % neutral-buffered formalin and processed for routine histopathological diagnosis. Results and discussion The distribution of the melanin pigment was observed in the periosteum, perichondrium, connective tissues of adventitia and serosae from several internal organs, {{as well as in}} the myocardium, perimysium and endomysium. Conclusion The knowledge of the normal distribution of the melanic pigment in the Silkie fowl tissues allow a better understanding of the histopathological conditions affecting this particular breed...|$|E
40|$|UV {{radiation}} {{is a well-known}} inducer of epidermal pigmentation that is utilized in therapy for vitiligo, one of the skin depigmentation disorders. Although {{it has been reported}} that melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) play essential roles in hair pigmentation, the relationship between McSCs and epidermal pigmentation remains unclear. Repetitive UVB irradiation on the dorsal skin of F 1 mice of HR- 1 × HR/De caused apparent epidermal pigmentation, and it was characterized by increase in the number of melanocytes. Interestingly, differentiation of McSCs into <b>melanoblasts</b> in hair follicles was followed by induction of epidermal melanocyte differentiation. Administration of a neutralizing antibody for Kit receptor that depletes resident <b>melanoblasts</b> could not suppress increased number of melanocytes. UVB irradiation also induced robust expression of Wnt 7 a as well as Kitl in epidermis, and β-catenin translocation into nucleus in McSCs. Intradermal injection of IWR- 1 (inhibitor of Wnt response 1), a chemical inhibitor of β-catenin activation, and small interfering RNA (siRNA) against Wnt 7 a suppressed increase in the number of epidermal melanocytes. Taken altogether, it was demonstrated that Wnt 7 a triggered McSCs differentiation through β-catenin activation, and Kitl might induce following migration of <b>melanoblasts</b> to epidermis. These findings will help in developing therapeutic technologies for vitiligo and other pigmentary disorders...|$|R
40|$|Oral {{melanotic}} nevi are uncommon oral lesions causing focal pigmentation. Melanotic nevi are benign melanocytic tumours {{originating from}} defective <b>melanoblasts</b> of the neural crest. Clinically, {{it is an}} asymptomatic, flat or slightly elevated lesion of brown or brown-black color. It is usually located on the palate and buccal mucosa and rarely on the gingiva and lips. Based on histological criteria, intraorally four types of nevi have been described: the intramucosal, junctional, compound and blue. In this article, we are reporting a case of oral pigmented lesion in a young female with an unusual history of associated occasional pain which was histopathogically diagnosed as intramucosal nevus. Key words: oral melanotic nevi, pigmentation, <b>melanoblasts</b> Oral pigmentation may be exogenous or endogenous in origin. Exogenous pigmentation is commonly due to foreignbody implantation in the oral mucosa...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in the P gene {{of humans}} and the {{homologous}} p-locus of mice, respectively, result in the homologous disorders oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA 2) and pink-eyed dilution. Although clearly required for melanin biosynthesis, the specific function of the P gene product, a melanosomal transmembrane protein expressed in melanocytes of the skin, hair and eyes, is not yet known. Here we describe lines of immortal melanocytes and <b>melanoblasts</b> from mice of the null genotype pcpp 25 H. These p-null melanocytes were severely hypopigmented, although they and the <b>melanoblasts</b> expressed mRNAs {{for a number of}} melanosomal proteins. Proliferation of the p-null <b>melanoblasts</b> was normal. Both diploid and immortal p-null melanocytes grew more slowly than wild-type melanocytes, however and were unusually susceptible to the antibiotic G 418; these abnormalities were corrected by culture in high concentrations of L-tyrosine. Transfection of the p-null melanocytes with full-length normal human P cDNA resulted in complementation of deficient melanin biosynthesis and hypopigmentation. In contrast, transfection mutant human P cDNAs containing amino acid substitutions (A 481 T, V 443 I) found in patients with OCA 2 resulted in minimal or partial correction, consistent with the corresponding pigmentation phenotypes in patients with these mutations. These results demonstrate the utility of this model system for distinguishing true OCA 2 mutations from nonpathologic polymorphisms and for quantitating the effect of these mutations on P function...|$|R
