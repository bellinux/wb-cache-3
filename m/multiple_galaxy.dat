40|$|We numerically {{investigate}} stellar and gaseous dynamical {{evolution of}} mergers between five identical late-type disk galaxies {{with the special}} emphasis on star formation history and chemical evolution of <b>multiple</b> <b>galaxy</b> mergers. We found that multiple encounter and merging can trigger repetitive massive starbursts (typically ∼ 100 M ⊙ yr − 1) owing to the strong tidal disturbance and the resultant gaseous dissipation during merging. The magnitude of the starburst is found to depend on initial virial ratio (i. e., the ratio of total kinematical energy to total potential energy) such that the maximum star formation rate is larger for the merger with smaller virial ratio. Furthermore {{we found that the}} time interval between the epochs of the triggered starbursts is longer for the merger with the larger virial ratio. The remnant of a <b>multiple</b> <b>galaxy</b> merger with massive starbursts is found to have metal-poor gaseous halo that is formed by tidal stripping during the merging. We accordingly suggest that metal-poor gaseous halo in a field elliptical galaxy is a fossil record of the past multiple merging events for the galaxy...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} Bayesian {{hierarchical}} inference formalism {{to study the}} relation between the properties of dark matter halos and those of their central galaxies using weak gravitational lensing. Unlike traditional methods, this technique does not resort to stacking the weak lensing signal in bins, and thus allows for a more efficient use of the information content in the data. Our method is particularly useful for constraining scaling relations between two or more galaxy properties and dark matter halo mass, and {{can also be used to}} constrain the intrinsic scatter in these scaling relations. We show that, if observational scatter is not properly accounted for, the traditional stacking method can produce biased results when exploring correlations between <b>multiple</b> <b>galaxy</b> properties and halo mass. For example, this bias can affect studies of the joint correlation between galaxy mass, halo mass, and galaxy size, or galaxy color. In contrast, our method easily and efficiently handles the intrinsic and observational scatter in <b>multiple</b> <b>galaxy</b> properties and halo mass. We test our method on mocks with varying degrees of complexity. We find that we can recover the mean halo mass and concentration, each with a 0. 1 dex accuracy, and the intrinsic scatter in halo mass with a 0. 05 dex accuracy. In its current version, our method will be most useful for studying the weak lensing signal around central galaxies in groups and clusters, as well as massive galaxies samples with M_* > 11, which have low satellite fractions.

Since then a large database on our and other warps has been built but they remain a puzzle for theorists trying to construct a general warp theory. Warps are observed to be common rather than rare features of spiral galaxies, which implies they are long lived. They are observed in both isolated and <b>multiple</b> <b>galaxy</b> systems in the gas but the stellar warp {{is often difficult to}} detect. The galactic warp is confined to the plane making it difficult to observe because of absorption and confusion, to add to this problem the sun appears to lie near to the line of nodes and to view the warp at it's largest extent we must observe through {{a large part of the}} disk.

Here, we present Hubble Space Telescope WFC 3 /IR grism observations of a clumpy galaxy at z= 1. 35, with evidence for 10 ^ 6 - 10 ^ 7 Msun rapidly growing black holes in separate sub-components of the host galaxy. These black holes could have been brought into close proximity as a consequence of a rare <b>multiple</b> <b>galaxy</b> merger or they could have formed in situ. Such holes would eventually merge into a central black hole as the stellar clumps/components presumably coalesce to form a galaxy bulge.

In this paper, we compare these novel X-ray observations with results from N-body + hydrodynamic adaptive mesh refinement cosmological simulations using the Enzo code. There is excellent {{agreement in the}} temperature, density, and entropy profiles between a sample of 27 mostly substructure-free massive clusters in the simulated volume and the observed clusters. This supports our previous contention that clusters have "universal" outer temperature profiles. Furthermore, {{it appears that the}} simplest adiabatic gas physics used in these Enzo simulations is adequate to model the outer regions of these clusters without other mechanisms (e. g., non-gravitational heating, cooling, magnetic fields, or cosmic rays). However, the outskirts of these clusters are not in hydrostatic equilibrium. There is significant bulk flow and turbulence in the outer intracluster medium created by accretion from filaments. Thus, the gas is not fully supported by thermal pressure. The implications for mass estimation from X-ray data are discussed. Comment: 23 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Ap...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} {{and evolution of}} gravitationally bound, star forming substructures in tidal tails of interacting galaxies, called tidal dwarf galaxies (TDG), has been studied, until now, only in idealised simulations of individual pairs of interacting galaxies for pre-determined orbits, mass ratios, and gas fractions. Here, we present the first identification of TDG candidates in fully cosmological simulations, specifically the high-resolution simulations of the EAGLE suite. The finite resolution of the simulation limits their ability to predict the exact formation rate and survival timescale of TDGs, but we show that gravitationally bound baryonic structures in tidal arms already form in current state-of-the-art cosmological simulations. In this case, the orbital parameter, disc orientations as well as stellar and gas masses and the specific angular momentum of the TDG forming galaxies are {{a direct consequence of}} cosmic structure formation. We identify TDG candidates {{in a wide range of}} environments, such as <b>multiple</b> <b>galaxy</b> mergers, clumpy high-redshift (up to z = 2) galaxies, high-speed encounters, and tidal interactions with gas-poor galaxies.

40|$|Weak {{gravitational}} lensing {{studies of}} galaxy clusters often assume a spherical cluster model {{to simplify the}} analysis, but some recent studies have suggested this simplifying assumption may result in large biases in estimated cluster masses and concentration values, since clusters are expected to exhibit triaxiality. Several such analyses have, however, quoted expressions for the spatial derivatives of the lensing potential in triaxial models, which are open to misinterpretation. In this paper, we give a clear description of weak lensing by triaxial NFW galaxy clusters and also present an efficient and robust method to model these clusters and obtain parameter estimates. By considering four highly triaxial NFW galaxy clusters, we re-examine the impact of simplifying spherical assumptions and found that while the concentration estimates are largely unbiased except {{in one of our}} traixial NFW simulated clusters, for which the concentration is only slightly biased, the masses are significantly biased, by up to 40 %, for all the clusters we analysed. Moreover, we find that such assumptions can lead to the erroneous conclusion that some substructure is present in the galaxy clusters or, even worse, that <b>multiple</b> <b>galaxy</b> clusters are present in the field. Our cluster fitting method also allows one to answer the question of whether a given cluster exhibits triaxiality or a simple spherical model is good enough.

40|$|We {{perform a}} {{systematic}} analysis {{of the effects of}} photometric redshift uncertainties on weak lensing tomography. We describe the photo-z distribution with a bias and Gaussian scatter that are allowed to vary arbitrarily between intervals of dz = 0. 1 in redshift. While the mere presence of bias and scatter does not substantially degrade dark energy information, uncertainties in both parameters do. For a fiducial next-generation survey each would need to be known to better than about 0. 003 - 0. 01 in redshift for each interval in order to lead to less than a factor of 1. 5 increase in the dark energy parameter errors. The more stringent requirement corresponds to a larger dark energy parameter space, when redshift variation in the equation of state of dark energy is allowed. Of order 10 ^ 4 - 10 ^ 5 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts fairly sampled from the source galaxy distribution will be needed to achieve this level of calibration. If the sample is composed of <b>multiple</b> <b>galaxy</b> types, a fair sample would be required for each. These requirements increase in stringency for more ambitious surveys; we quantify such scalings with a convenient fitting formula. No single aspect of a photometrically binned selection of galaxies such as their mean or median suffices, indicating that dark energy parameter determinations are sensitive to the shape and nature of outliers in the photo-z redshift distribution.

40|$|This is {{the first}} in a series of papers {{examining}} the demographics of star-forming galaxies at 0. 2 <z< 2. 5 in CANDELS. We study 9, 100 galaxies from GOODS-S and UDS having published values of redshifts, masses, star-formation rates (SFRs), and dust attenuation (A_V) derived from UV-optical SED fitting. In agreement with previous works, we find that the UVJ colors of a galaxy are closely correlated with its specific star-formation rate (SSFR) and A_V. We define rotated UVJ coordinate axes, termed S_SED and C_SED, that are parallel and perpendicular to the star-forming sequence and derive a quantitative calibration that predicts SSFR from C_SED with an accuracy of 0. 2 dex. SFRs from UV-optical fitting and from UV+IR values based on Spitzer/MIPS 24 μm agree well overall, but systematic differences of order 0. 2 dex exist at high and low redshifts. A novel plotting scheme conveys the evolution of <b>multiple</b> <b>galaxy</b> properties simultaneously, and dust growth, as well as star-formation decline and quenching, exhibit "mass-accelerated evolution" ("downsizing"). A population of transition galaxies below the star-forming main sequence is identified. These objects are located between star-forming and quiescent galaxies in UVJ space and have lower A_V and smaller radii than galaxies on the main sequence. Their properties are consistent with their being in transit between the two regions. The relative numbers of quenched, transition, and star-forming galaxies are given as a function of mass and redshift. Comment: 34 pages, 25 figures, ApJ resubmitted after referee repor...|$|E

The bright mid-infrared source (F(24 um) = 0. 86 mJy) was first detected in observations made using the Spitzer Space Telescope. Existing broad-band imaging data from the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey revealed the mid-infrared source to be associated with a diffuse, spatially extended, optical counterpart in the Bw band. Spectroscopy and further imaging of this target reveals that the optical source is an almost purely line-emitting nebula with little, if any, detectable diffuse continuum emission. The Lya nebula has a luminosity of L[Lya] ~ 1. 7 e 44 erg/s and an extent of at least 20 arcsec (160 kpc). Its central ~ 8 arcsec shows an ordered, monotonic velocity profile; interpreted as rotation, this region encloses a mass M = 6 e 12 Msun. Several sources lie within the nebula. The central region of the nebula shows narrow (~ 365 km/s) emission lines of CIV and HeII. The mid-infrared source is a compact object lying within the nebula, but offset from the center by a projected distance of ~ 2. 5 arcsec (20 kpc), and likely to be an enshrouded AGN. A young star-forming galaxy lies near the northern end of the nebula.

In contrast, the power spectrum of our reconstructed halo density field deviates from the underlying matter power spectrum at the ≤ 1 % level for k ≤ 0. 1 h Mpc − 1 and ≤ 4 % at k = 0. 2 h Mpc − 1.

We present a photometric study of this group in the optical (HST), infrared (Spitzer) and X-ray (Chandra) regimes aimed at characterizing the star formation and nuclear activity in its constituent galaxies and intra-group medium.

Star formation is proceeding at a level consistent with the morphological types of the four main galaxies, of which two are star-forming and the other two quiescent. Unlike in some other compact groups, star-forming complexes across HCG 59 closely follow mass-radius scaling relations typical of nearby galaxies. In contrast, the ancient globular cluster populations in galaxies HCG 59 A and B show intriguing irregularities, and two extragalactic HII regions are found just west of B. We age-date a faint stellar stream in the intra-group medium at ~ 1 Gyr to examine recent interactions. We detect a likely low-luminosity AGN in HCG 59 A by its ~ 10 e 40 erg/s X-ray emission; the active nucleus rather than star formation can account for the UV+IR SED.

The fidelity of CMB maps and galaxy cluster catalogs depend on understanding the galaxy populations, globally as well as on a local astrophysical level where they impact the ability to generate reliable mass-observable relations for galaxy clusters, which are important for cluster-derived cosmology. The multifrequency nature of ACT data permits the characterization of <b>multiple</b> <b>galaxy</b> populations through their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) in a relatively unexplored frequency regime. Analysis of ACT-selected galaxies informs the current understanding of the evolution of structure formation over cosmic time. ^ This thesis begins by motivating the ACT science. A description of the ACT telescope and camera, with focus on the bandpass determination for the three optics tubes of the camera is followed by a synopsis of the observations to date. The map-making strategies used to produce the data analyzed for this thesis are reviewed, to provide background for the source analysis derived from ACT maps. ACT-detected source populations are analyzed in detail, including data taken during follow-up observations on the Australian Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 20 GHz. ...|$|E
40|$|We use semi-analytic {{models and}} cosmological merger trees {{to provide the}} initial {{conditions}} for multi-merger numerical hydrodynamic simulations, and exploit these simulations to explore the effect of galaxy interaction and merging on star formation (SF). We compute numerical realisations of twelve merger trees from z= 1. 5 to z= 0. We include {{the effects of the}} large hot gaseous halo around all galaxies, following recent obervations and predictions of galaxy formation models. We find that including the hot gaseous halo has a number of important effects. Firstly, as expected, the star formation rate on long timescales is increased due to cooling of the hot halo and refuelling of the cold gas reservoir. Secondly, we find that interactions do not always increase the SF in the long term. This is partially due to the orbiting galaxies transferring gravitational energy to the hot gaseous haloes and raising their temperature. Finally we find that the relative size of the starburst, when including the hot halo, is much smaller than previous studies showed. Our simulations also show that the order and timing of interactions are important for the evolution of a <b>galaxy.</b> When <b>multiple</b> <b>galaxies</b> interact at the same time, the SF enhancement is less than when galaxies interact in series. All these effects show the importance of including hot gas and cosmologically motivated merger trees in galaxy evolution models. Comment: 19 pages, 15 figures, 6 tables.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a study on galaxy interactions, tides, and other {{processes}} which produce luminous fine-scale substructures in the galaxy clusters: Coma, Perseus, Abell 2199, AWM 3 and AWM 5. All unusual structures in these clusters can be categorized in seven morphologies: interacting <b>galaxies,</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>galaxies</b> (non-interacting), distorted galaxies, tailed galaxies, line galaxies, dwarf galaxy groups and galaxy aggregates. The various morphologies are described, and a catalog is presented of 248 objects in these five clusters along with color, and positional information obtained from CCD images taken with the WIYN 3. 5 m telescope in broadband B and R filters. Distorted, interacting, and fine-scale substructures have a range of colors extending from blue objects with B-R ≈ 0, to redder colors at B-R ≈ 2. 5. We also find that the structures with the most disturbed morphology have the bluest colors. Additionally, the relative number distributions of these structures suggests that two separate classes of galaxy clusters exist: one dominated by distorted structures and the other dominated by galaxy associations. The Coma and Perseus clusters, respectively, are proposed as models for these types of clusters. Possible mechanisms for the production of fine-scale substructure are reviewed and compared to observations of z ≈ 0. 4 Butcher-Oemler clusters. We conclude, based on color, positional, and statistical data, that the most likely mechanism for the creation of these structures is through an interaction with the gravitational potential of the cluster, possibly coupled with effects of high speed interactions with large cluster ellipticals.

40|$|We {{report on}} the search for galaxies in the {{proximity}} of two very metal-poor gas clouds at z ∼ 3 towards the quasar Q 0956 + 122. With a 5 -hour Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) integration in a ∼ 500 × 500 kpc 2 region centred at the quasar position, we achieve a ≥ 80 [*]per[*]cent complete spectroscopic survey of continuum-detected galaxies with mR ≤ 25 mag and Lyα emitters with luminosity LLyα ≥ 3 × 1041 [*]erg[*]s− 1. We do not identify galaxies at the redshift of a z ∼ 3. 2 Lyman limit system (LLS) with log[*]Z/Z⊙ = − 3. 35 ± 0. 05, placing this gas cloud in the intergalactic medium or circumgalactic medium of a galaxy below our sensitivity limits. Conversely, we detect five Lyα emitters at the redshift of a pristine z ∼ 3. 1 LLS with log[*]Z/Z⊙ ≤ − 3. 8, while ∼ 0. 4 sources were expected given the z ∼ 3 Lyα luminosity function. Both this high detection rate {{and the fact that}} at least three emitters appear aligned in projection with the LLS suggest that this pristine cloud is tracing a gas filament that is feeding one or <b>multiple</b> <b>galaxies.</b> Our observations uncover two different environments for metal-poor LLSs, implying a complex link between these absorbers and galaxy haloes, which ongoing MUSE surveys will soon explore in detail. Moreover, in agreement with recent MUSE observations, we detected a ∼ 90 [*]kpc Lyα nebula at the quasar redshift and three Lyα emitters reminiscent of a ‘dark galaxy’ population...|$|R
