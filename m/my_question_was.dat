60|$|Benjamin started. <b>My</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> {{certainly}} a strange one, {{after what he}} had just said to me.|$|E
60|$|I {{thanked him}} {{and made my}} way thither across the {{reception}} hall. The answer to <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> given at once.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was not wishing {{you to give}} me so {{much your}} own ideas, as the common talk of the town; but I see that <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> indiscreet, and I ask your pardon." ...|$|E

60|$|Well and good! On {{that issue}} every Socialist is with them. But their answer to <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> none the less wrong.|$|R
6000|$|... "You or any and I or any--what sort {{of speech}} is that? Is it a compliment, think you, to be {{mixed with a}} drove in that fashion? <b>My</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> of you and me. If I were wronged would you be my man?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Yet my informant, {{this ancient}} and {{singularly}} intelligent old man, a gamekeeper all his life, who knows his jackdaw, {{could not tell}} me why gamekeepers no longer persecute so injurious a bird I He will not allow a sparrow-hawk to exist in his woods, yet all he could say when I repeated <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>was,</b> [...] "No keeper ever thinks of hurting a jack now, but I can't say why." ...|$|E
60|$|So <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> {{answered}} unexpectedly. Unk Wunk was out for {{fun that}} afternoon, and had {{rolled down the}} hill for {{the joy of the}} swift motion and the dizzy feeling afterwards, as other wood folk do. I have watched young foxes, whose den was on a steep hill side, rolling down one after the other, and sometime varying the programme by having one cub roll as fast as he could, while another capered alongside, snapping and worrying him in his brain-muddling tumble.|$|E
40|$|There is, I shall assume, such a {{thing as}} moral evil (more on which below). <b>My</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> whether is also {{such a thing}} as non-moral evil, and in {{particular}} whether there are such things as aesthetic evil and epistemic evil. More exactly, <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> whether there is {{such a thing as}} moral evil but not such a thing as non-moral evil, in some sense that reveals something special about the moral, as opposed to such would-be non-moral domains as the aesthetic and the epistemic. The philosophical issue at stake here is that of the nature of these different normative domains, and the nature and extent of their difference...|$|R

60|$|The quick, {{sensitive}} glance that Anneke gave me, said plainly {{enough that}} <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> indiscreet, {{and it was}} no sooner put than it was regretted. A shadow passed athwart the sweet face of my companion, and a moment of deep, and, as I fancied, of painful thought succeeded. Then a light broke over all, a smile illumined her features, after which a light girlish laugh came to show how active were the agents within, and how strong was the native tendency to happiness and humour.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} his tired face, at the car thick with dust, at the Chinese {{ambassador}} already nodding in his corner, and I smiled to myself. It was very certain {{to me that they}} had run from London without stopping, and I felt an intense curiosity as to their destination. However, I said no more to them. I made my adieux to Delora, and bowed profoundly to the Chinese ambassador, who opened his eyes in time solemnly to return my farewell. The chauffeur was already in his place, and I stopped to speak to him. I saw Delora spring forward and whistle down the speaking-tube, but <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> already asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "That night--I {{tell you}} now {{what it would be}} a bitter thing for me to tell in a court of law--I was restless and sleepless, as often happens when a man has kept awake over long. My mind would dwell upon the fall of the cards, and I was tossing and turning in my bed, when {{suddenly}} a cry fell upon my ears, and then a second louder one, coming from the direction of Captain Barrington's room. Five minutes later I heard steps passing down the passage, and, without striking a light, I opened my door and peeped out, thinking that some one was taken unwell. There was Lord Avon walking towards me. In one hand he held a guttering candle and in the other a brown bag, which chinked as he moved. His face was all drawn and distorted--so much so that <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> frozen upon my lips. Before I could utter it he turned into his chamber and softly closed the door.|$|E

5000|$|In 1978, Faurisson {{authored}} a French-language text, [...] "The Diary of Anne Frank Is It Authentic?". It {{appeared in}} Dutch-language translation in 1985, with the modified title, [...] "The Diary of Anne Frank A Forgery". The text questioned various {{elements of the}} Diary of Anne Frank, {{including the use of}} a vacuum cleaner by the family while in hiding. Faurisson continued,"Vacuum cleaners at that time were exceptionally noisy. I must ask: 'Is this credible?' <b>My</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> not just a formality. It is not rhetorical. Its purpose is not to astonish. <b>My</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> simply a <b>question.</b> An answer will have to be found." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>My</b> <b>question</b> for you <b>is</b> one {{of moral}} standards. I {{would really like}} to share these songs with the DMB trading community. However, I feel that if the Dave Matthews Band and Steve Lillywhite didn't release these songs, then what gives me that right? I don't want to disrespect the band, or yourself. I guess <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> simply this::Am I disrespecting the Dave Matthews Band and Steve Lillywhite by making these songs available? ...|$|R
5000|$|How {{far away}} from a corner in a room is it no longer a corner? If {{you are in a}} pocket, at what point do you pass when you are no longer in the pocket?

5000|$|... "When I {{read the}} Bible I saw Jesus doing {{creative}} interventions, healings and actions {{that made the}} moral choices visible. I began to ask myself if I was as willing to die for my convictions as Vietnamese and American soldiers all around me were being asked to do. I {{was looking for a}} way to say yes to life instead of operating by static lines drawn by our church over the centuries. Later when I returned to theological studies, I realized <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> not a new question. During the most dynamic periods of creativity our churches had tried many ways to point to a different path. In fact many had died for their choices. I was coming to see myself as operating in that stream." ...|$|E
5000|$|..... Interwoven among {{scenes of}} [...] "reality" [...] were stylized {{interviews}} {{with a series}} of [...] "establishment figures" [...] - an Anglican Bishop, a nuclear strategist, etc. The outrageous statements by some of these people (including the Bishop) - in favour of nuclear weapons, even nuclear war - were actually based on genuine quotations. Other interviews with a doctor, a psychiatrist, etc. were more sober, and gave details of the effects of nuclear weapons on the human body and mind. In this film I was interested in breaking the illusion of media-produced [...] "reality". <b>My</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> - [...] "Where is 'reality'? ... in the madness of statements by these artificially-lit establishment figures quoting the official doctrine of the day, or in the madness of the staged and fictional scenes from the rest of my film, which presented the consequences of their utterances?" ...|$|E

5000|$|The type {{of films}} I like {{are the ones}} on which the filmmakers have their own voice and take risks, using the camera as an {{expansive}} tool, I think the camera should take {{the intent of the}} scene and I like to put a camera where it can tell you more about what happens and is not limited to display it. I am very attached to the composition, with the frames, I'm very obsessive on that part, because to me everything has to do with emotion, because it is what dictates the planes and everything. David Pablos, Encuadres. [...] Pablos earned his academic degree from the CCC with the short film La Canción de los Niños Muertos in 2008. The film about five teenagers who lose their mother, starring Sebastián Aguirre and Rodrigo Azuela, won for Best Fiction Short Film at the Morelia International Film Festival and was screened during the International Critics' Week of the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. For this work, Pablos earned the Ariel Award for Best Live Action Short and also the SIGNIS Award during the 4th International Short Film Festival (FICMEX), being the SIGNIS jury's verdict that [...] "the film narrative takes us into the complexity of disparate feelings as violence and tenderness, anger and forgiveness, rebellion and reconciliation." [...] After directing the documentaries La Escritura en la Pared and Una Frontera, Todas las Fronteras (2010), Pablos premiered in 2013 his first feature film, La Vida Después, also starring Azuela, Américo Hollander and María Renée Prudencio. The film, about two brothers searching for their stranged mother, received the Klic Award granted by the Mexican movie theater chain Cinépolis during the Morelia Film Festival. La Vida Después was the only Mexican film screened during the 70th Venice International Film Festival and according to Pablos is about [...] "living in the same roof with a complete stranger, although that is your family... {{it has to do with}} the lack of communication". About the thematic similarities between his first short film and his first feature film, Pablos stated to magazine Encuadres:"I knew that I was interested in keep talking about family, namely, about brotherhood, but in the process I discovered what was the true essence of this film La Vida Después, which is about family heritage emotionally more than physically and how your children refuse to follow the footsteps of their parents because often there is a kind of chain that is impossible to break and this generates feelings of frustration and rejection. <b>My</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> whether the chain can be broken or not, and what the consequences are and what involves the separation of the family that mother" [...] loves."

40|$|I {{do believe}} in the proverb which says “every why has a wherefore”.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to test the repairing effect of “fluoride varnish-Duraphat” on demineralization of tooth in single and repeated applications. <b>My</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> “What is the difference between single and repeated applications of fluoride agent (Duraphat varnish) on demineralized tooth surface?” It was hypothesized that “ There would be {{a significant difference in the}} means of repairing effect of fluoride on demineralized tooth after repeated applications”. To test the research question and the hypothesis, experiments were conducted. The method used was taking the demineralized tooth and apply a fluoride-varnish and note down the difference in demineralization after single and repeated applications. For this, demineralization was produced experimentally by applying...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} part of a larger study on the effect of an experimentally-created gap on adult canopy trees. The results of a {{non-linear}} regression model showed that within ten meters of the gap edge the tree species that showed the greatest significant growth response to the gap was Acer saccharum (sugar maple), a shade tolerant species. <b>My</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> whether this response in growth rate was due to a species effect or due to a height effect. Tree radial growth response to the gap was calculated for a total of fifty trees within all four transects next to an experimentally-created large gap. A two-way ANOVA was conducted with the predictors being species and height class, and the response being tree radial growth. A two-way ANOVA was also conducted with the same predictors and response, but with data for only trees within the first ten meters from the gap. The results of both two-way ANOVAs showed that species was a predictor of tree radial growth response and that height was not. Thus, it appears that whether a tree is of canopy or subcanopy height does not affect it...|$|E
40|$|Many {{animals have}} a normal flora in their intestines; a normal flora is a {{collection}} of bacteria that lines the epithelium of the intestine. Normal flora are often beneficial to the host in assisting with the digestion and absorption of nutrients, the production of vitamins and other essential factors. Normal flora may also help fight off infection by pathogenic microbes. <b>My</b> <b>question</b> <b>was,</b> 2 ̆ 7 Is there a normal flora in the midgut trunk of the shrimp Sicyonia ingentis? 2 ̆ 7 The midgut trunk (MGT) is not an intestine in that it is not involved in digestion or absorption. However, it secretes a peritrophic membrane that wraps ingested food, including bacteria, and moves it out of the MGT. The membrane also persists as the wrapper of the fecal pellet. The literature on normal flora in crustaceans is contradictory; one report states {{that there is not a}} normal flora, while others say that it is present. The following three approaches were used to address my research topic: 1) Culturing ground up MGTs and plating them onto LBS agar to test for the presence of bacteria. 2) Examining sections of the MGT with and without staining by DAPI in an attempt to determine the distribution of bacteria using fluorescence microscopy...|$|E
40|$|When I was {{considering}} {{the question of}} the moral right to attribution and how unauthorized fan creativity relates to that concept, it struck me that there are two interesting issues from a theoretical perspective. The first is: who gets the credit? When I was in law school and discovered fan fiction, the reason why I got into intellectual property was because most of these stories had a disclaimer-no copyright infringement intended, these characters aren 2 ̆ 7 t mine, I 2 ̆ 7 m not making any money, please don 2 ̆ 7 t sue. And as a student, <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> – does that work? Is that good enough? I was interested in these disclaimers because copyright law does not have an explicit place in the fair use test for evaluating disclaimers as a factor favoring a defense in the way that trademark law does. I, nonetheless, concluded that, in general, fan fiction was going to be fair use. It has yet to be litigated to any particular conclusion. Although cease and desist letters do so still go out, and fans still either comply or they say no, generally there is no result. That is, I {{think a lot of the}} copyright owners are unwilling to deal with the publicity and the possibility of finding this as fair use in a litigated case...|$|E
