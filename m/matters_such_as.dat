5|$|Coatbridge is {{represented}} by three tiers of elected government. North Lanarkshire Council, the unitary local authority for Coatbridge, is based at Motherwell, and is the executive, deliberative and legislative body responsible for local governance.

5|$|During this period, Luxembourg {{was allowed}} to retain its own {{government}} and political system, but all proceedings were overshadowed by the German army's presence. Despite the overbearing distraction of the occupation, the Luxembourgish people attempted to lead their lives as normally as possible. The political parties attempted to focus on other <b>matters,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the economy, education, and constitutional reform.|$|E

5|$|In Guatemala, <b>matters</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> {{developing}} standardized orthographies for the Mayan {{languages are}} governed by the Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala (ALMG; Guatemalan Academy of Mayan Languages), which was founded by Maya organisations in 1986. Following the 1996 peace accords, it has been gaining a growing recognition as the regulatory authority on Mayan languages both among Mayan scholars and the Maya peoples.|$|E

5|$|Canon law {{concerns}} the Catholic Church's life and organisation and {{is distinct from}} civil law. In its own field it gives force to civil law only by specific enactment in <b>matters</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the guardianship of minors. Similarly, civil law may give force in its field to canon law, but only by specific enactment, as with regard to canonical marriages. Currently, the 1983 Code of Canon Law is in effect primarily for the Latin Church. The distinct 1990 Code of Canons for the Eastern Churches (CCEO, after the Latin initials) applies to the autonomous Eastern Catholic Churches.|$|E
5|$|Just {{like most}} punk songs, Girlschool’s lyrics usually have short and direct texts, often {{reflecting}} the wild rock 'n' roll lifestyle and treating sex and romance {{as seen from}} a feminine point of view, {{with the use of}} reverse sexism and tongue-in-cheek sense of humour. Some of their songs deal also with more serious <b>matters,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> exploitation and abuse of women, murder, addiction, the destruction of the environment, social and political issues.|$|E

Rinder says that Miscavige was furious with the way that Sweeney had been handled and ordered Rinder to go to Sussex to dig ditches on a Church property there. He defected instead, eventually settling in Denver.|$|E
5|$|Morrison {{abandoned}} the abstract folk jazz compositions of Astral Weeks {{in favor of}} more formally composed songs on Moondance, which he wrote and produced entirely himself. Its lively rhythm and blues/rock music was the style he would become most known for in his career. The music incorporated soul, jazz, pop, and Irish folk sounds into songs about finding spiritual renewal and redemption in worldly <b>matters</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> nature, music, romantic love, and self-affirmation.|$|E
5|$|Muslims {{are obliged}} to follow the {{decisions}} of Syariah courts in matters concerning their religion. The Islamic judges are expected to follow the Shafi'i legal school of Islam, which is the main madh'hab of Malaysia. The jurisdiction of Syariah courts is limited to Muslims in <b>matters</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> marriage, inheritance, divorce, apostasy, religious conversion, and custody among others. No other criminal or civil offences are {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Shariah courts, which have a similar hierarchy to the Civil Courts. Despite being the supreme courts of the land, the Civil Courts do not hear matters related to Islamic practices.|$|E

5|$|One Hot Minute was {{the only}} album that guitarist Dave Navarro {{recorded}} with the band. His presence altered the Red Hot Chili Peppers' sound considerably. It contains fewer sexual themes than previous records and explores darker subject <b>matters,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> drug use, depression, anguish, and grief. It also re-integrated use of heavy metal guitar riffs. Vocalist Anthony Kiedis, who had resumed addictions to cocaine and heroin in 1994 after being sober {{for more than five}} years, approached his lyricism with a reflective outlook on drugs and their harsh effects.|$|E
5|$|The Sejm had mostly {{advisory}} powers, {{although it}} could legislate on some strictly local <b>matters,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> communal self-government and spending of some local taxes. It could opine legal acts {{relevant to the}} Grand Duchy. Its deputies {{had the right to}} file petitions and complaints to the King of Prussia, who could consent or reject (as was often the case) the Sejm proposals. Proposals from and to the King required a two-thirds majority; other proposals required a simple majority.|$|E
5|$|While {{the global}} {{financial}} system is edging toward greater stability, governments must deal with differing regional or national needs. Some nations are trying to orderly discontinue unconventional monetary policies installed to cultivate recovery, while others are expanding their scope and scale. Emerging market policymakers face a challenge of precision as they must carefully institute sustainable macroeconomic policies during extraordinary market sensitivity without provoking investors to retreat their capital to stronger markets. Nations' inability to align interests and achieve international consensus on <b>matters</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> banking regulation has perpetuated the risk of future global financial catastrophes.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the use of}} she and he for {{inanimate objects}} is not very {{frequent}} in Standard Modern English, {{it is in fact}} fairly widespread in some varieties of English. Gender assignment to inanimate nouns in these dialects is sometimes fairly systematic. For example, in some dialects of southwest England, masculine pronouns are used for individuated or countable <b>matter,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> iron tools, while the neuter form is used for non-individuated <b>matter,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> liquids, fire and other substances.|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1538, {{shortly before}} the Catholic Duke Georg of Saxony died, a {{religious}} colloquy was convened in Leipzig to discuss potential reforms within the Duchy. The Electorate of Saxony sent Melanchthon, and Philip of Hesse sent Bucer. The Duchy itself was represented by Georg Witzel, a former Lutheran who had reconverted to Catholicism. In discussions from 2 to 7 January 1539, Bucer and Witzel agreed to defer controversial points of doctrine, but Melanchthon withdrew, feeling that doctrinal unity was a prerequisite of a reform plan. Bucer and Witzel agreed on fifteen articles covering various issues of church life. Bucer, however, made no doctrinal concessions: he remained silent on critical <b>matters</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the mass and the papacy. His ecumenical approach provoked harsh criticism from other reformers.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{views on}} {{sexuality}} vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality {{have taken a}} few different directions. <b>Matters</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the sex industry, sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in {{what came to be}} known as the feminist sex wars, which pitted anti-pornography feminism against sex-positive feminism, and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates. Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the sexual revolution from the 1960s and 70s. Over the course of the 1970s, a large number of influential women accepted lesbian and bisexual women as part of feminism.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{suggest that}} Gregory's main motivation was {{to increase the}} number of Christians; others wonder if more political <b>matters</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> extending the primacy of the papacy to additional provinces and the recruitment of new Christians looking to Rome for leadership were also involved. Such considerations may have also played a part, as influencing the emerging power of the Kentish Kingdom under Æthelberht could have had some bearing on the choice of location. Also, the mission may have been an outgrowth of the missionary efforts against the Lombards. At the time of the mission Britain was the only part of the former Roman Empire which remained in pagan hands and the historian Eric John argues that Gregory desired to bring the last remaining pagan area of the old empire back under Christian control.|$|E
