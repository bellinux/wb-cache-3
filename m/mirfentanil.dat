50|$|<b>Mirfentanil</b> was {{synthesized}} via acylation of {{the product}} of the reaction of 2-chloropyrazine and 1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinone oxime with 2-Furoyl chloride.|$|E
5000|$|... 2-Furoyl {{chloride}} has {{no major}} applications {{but it has}} been used as a chemical intermediate in the synthesis of various pharmaceuticals; examples include mometasone furoate, fluticasone furoate, diloxanide furoate, Ceftiofur (Excenel), and <b>mirfentanil.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Mirfentanil</b> is a {{fentanyl}} derivative {{with strong}} selectivity for the μ opioid receptor. At lower doses, it antagonizes the analgesic effects of alfentanil and substitutes for naloxone in morphine-treated monkeys; however, it also reverses naloxone-precipitated withdrawal in pigeons trained to discriminate morphine from naloxone.|$|E
40|$|<b>Mirfentanil</b> [N-(2 -pyrarmnyl) -N-(1 -phenethyl- 4 -pipendinyl) - 2 -fur-amide] was {{studied for}} its binding {{affinity}} in isolated neuronal membranes, {{and for its}} effects in vivo. In binding to opioid receptors in monkey brain membranes, <b>mirfentanil</b> was much more selective for sites (7. 99 nM) than for either K (1 428 nM) or 6 (480 nM) sites as measured by displacement of[3 H]DAMGO, [3 H]U- 69, 593 or [3 H]DPDPE, respectively. In morphine-treated pigeons discriminating among naltrexone, saline and morphine, mirtentanil failed to substitute for either training drug; in mor-phine-abstinent pigeons, <b>mirfentanil</b> reversed responding on the naltrexone key (i. a, reversed withdrawal). In morphine-treated monkeys discriminating between saline and naltrexone, mirfen-tanil substituted completely for naltrexone, and this effect was attenuated by an acute injection of morphine; <b>mirfentanil</b> als...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{synthesis}} of fentanyl derivatives, {{some of which}} appear to have novel profiles of pharmacological effects, has provided compelling evidence that μ opioid efficacy might be altered systematically by modifications in the parent compound fentanyl. In the present study a new 4 -(heteroanilido) -piperidine, compound 28, was studied for its effects in rhesus monkeys. In self-administration studies compound 28 maintained rates of lever pressing similar to those maintained by alfentanil; the reinforcing effects of compound 28 were attenuated by the opioid antagonist quadazocine. In drug discrimination studies compound 28 did not substitute for the κ agonist ethylketocyclazocine and did substitute for the μ agonist alfentanil. In morphine-treated subjects discriminating between saline and naltrexone, compound 28 did not substitute for naltrexone; however, in morphine-abstinent subjects compound 28 reversed naltrexone lever responding. Moreover, this discriminative stimulus effect in morphine-abstinent subjects was antagonized by naltrexone and by quadazocine {{in a manner consistent}} with μ receptor mediation. Compound 28 also was an effective analgesic in a warm-water, tail-withdrawal procedure and it decreased markedly respiratory function. The analgesic effects as well as the respiratory depressant effects of compound 28 were antagonized by quadazocine. Together, these results show compound 28 to be a potent, efficacious μ agonist of similar potency to alfentanil. Large differences in apparent efficacy at μ receptors between compound 28 and another compound in this series (<b>mirfentanil),</b> clearly demonstrate that, within this chemical family, small chemical changes can confer significant differences in pharmacologic effect...|$|E
