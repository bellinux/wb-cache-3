6000|$|But Austro-Columbia {{presents}} difficulties {{from which}} Australia is free; Camelidae and Tapiridae are now indigenous in South America {{as they are}} in Arctogaea; and, among the Pliocene Austro-Columbian mammals, the Austro-Columbian genera Equus, Mastodon, and <b>Machairodus</b> are numbered. Are these Postmiocene immigrants, or Praemiocene natives? ...|$|E
60|$|That {{there was}} a {{continuity}} of dry land between Europe and North America during the Miocene epoch, appears {{to me to be}} a necessary consequence of the fact that many genera of terrestrial mammals, such as Castor, Hystrix, Elephas, Mastodon, Equus, Hipparion, Anchitherium, Rhinoceros, Cervus, Amphicyon, Hyaenarctos, and <b>Machairodus,</b> are common to the Miocene formations of the two areas, and have as yet been found (except perhaps Anchitherium) in no deposit of earlier age. Whether this connection took place by the east, or by the west, or by both sides of the Old World, there is at present no certain evidence, and the question is immaterial to the present argument; but, as there are good grounds for the belief that the Australian province and the Indian and South-African sub-provinces were separated by sea from the rest of Arctogaea before the Miocene epoch, so it has been rendered no less probable, by the investigations of Mr. Carrick Moore and Professor Duncan, that Austro-Columbia was separated by sea from North America during a large part of the Miocene epoch.|$|E
60|$|The same equable climate would {{probably}} cause a more uniform distribution of moisture, and render what are now desert regions capable of supporting abundance of animal life. This {{is indicated by}} the number and variety of the species of large animals {{that have been found}} fossil in very limited areas which they evidently inhabited at one period. M. Albert Gaudry found, in the deposits of a mountain stream at Pikermi in Greece, an abundance of large mammalia such as are nowhere to be found living together at the present time. Among them were two species of Mastodon, two different rhinoceroses, a gigantic wild boar, a camel and a giraffe larger than those now living, several monkeys, carnivora ranging from martens and civets to lions and hyaenas of the largest size, numerous antelopes of at least five distinct genera, and besides these many forms altogether extinct. Such were the great herds of Hipparion, an ancestral form of horse; the Helladotherium, a huge animal bigger than the giraffe; the Ancylotherium, one of the Edentata; the huge Dinotherium; the Aceratherium, allied to the rhinoceros; and the monstrous Chalicotherium, allied to the swine and ruminants, but as large as a rhinoceros; and to prey upon these, the great <b>Machairodus</b> or sabre-toothed tiger. And all these remains were found in a space 300 paces long by 60 paces broad, many of the species existing in enormous quantities.|$|E
50|$|<b>Machairodus</b> aphanistus fossils {{recovered}} from Batallones reveal {{a high percentage}} of tooth breakages, indicating that unlike later machairodonts, {{due to a lack of}} protruding incisors <b>Machairodus</b> often used its sabers to subdue prey in a manner similar to modern cats; this was a more risky strategy that virtually ensured that damage to their saber teeth often occurred.|$|E

50|$|<b>Machairodus</b> {{was similar}} {{in size to}} a modern lion, {{standing}} about 1 meter at the shoulder. The species once referred to <b>Machairodus</b> coloradensis was apparently significantly larger, about 1.2 m at the shoulder, according to skeletal and life reconstructions. If accurate, this would have made M. coloradensis {{one of the largest}} felids. However M. coloradensis, along with M. kurteni and M. giganteus, has been reassigned to the genus Amphimachairodus and by extent, the Homotherini based on both morphology and its time of appearance in North America. Nimravides catacopsis also has been separated from <b>Machairodus,</b> as the two are too different in regards to autapomorphies to be synonymous. However, the species <b>Machairodus</b> horribilis, which stands as the largest known species of the genus, is comparable in size to the equally large and much later Smilodon, weighing in at around 404.6 kg (892 lb.). Its skull, measuring upwards of 16 inches in length, is the largest known skull for any machairodont.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Machairodus</b> {{was first}} named in 1832, by German Naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup. Though its remains were known since 1824, it was {{believed}} by Georges Cuvier that the fossils {{had come from a}} species of bear, which he called [...] "Ursus cultridens" [...] (known today as Megantereon) based on composite sample of teeth from different countries, species and geologic ages, leading to what would become a long series of complications. Kaup however, recognized the teeth as those of felids and promptly reclassified the existing specimens as <b>Machairodus,</b> including M. cultridens in it. The name quickly gained acceptance {{and by the end of}} the 19th Century, many species of felid or related feliform (such as nimravids) were lumped into the genus <b>Machairodus,</b> including but not limited to Sansanosmilus, Megantereon, Paramachairodus, Amphimachairodus, Nimravides, and Homotherium among others. This would eventually turn <b>Machairodus</b> into something of a wastebasket taxon, which would be rectified with the discoveries of more complete skeletons of other machairodonts.|$|E
50|$|The scimitar-toothed machairodonts, {{including}} <b>Machairodus,</b> Miomachairodus, Homotherium, Adelphailurus, Dinofelis, Metailurus, Paramachairodus, Therailurus, Lokotunjailurus, and technically Xenosmilus, are a {{much more}} diverse group and most machairodonts fall into this less specialized type. The canines of this larger group are significantly shorter and generally stouter. Because {{of the diversity of}} the genera, it is difficult to illustrate a specific type. Homotherium was once thought to be plantigrade, but was proven to be digitigrade. This group is generally much leaner and smaller on average, though <b>Machairodus</b> was one of the largest, if not the largest, of all machairodonts. Some display high degrees of sexual dimorphism, unlike the dirk-toothed cats (<b>Machairodus).</b> Homotherium bore a sloped back that might have made it excellent at running long distances, similar to the living spotted hyena. They usually had longer legs and a more lithe form. They had more teeth than the average dirk-toothed machairodont, with six premolars on the mandible. <b>Machairodus</b> appears to have been an excellent jumper. When viewing only postcranial remains of similar-toothed machairodonts, their forms were comparatively similar to modern pantherines (genera Panthera, Neofelis, and Uncia).|$|E
50|$|<b>Machairodus</b> {{seemed to}} prefer open {{woodland}} habitat, {{as evidenced by}} finds at Cerro de los Batallones, which is of Vallesian age. As a top predator at Batallones, it would have hunted large herbivores of the time. Such herbivores would have included horses like Hipparion, the hornless rhinoceros Aceratherium, the gomphotherid mastodon Tetralophodon, the suid Microstonyx, silvatherid giraffes and boselaphine antelope. <b>Machairodus</b> would have competed for such prey with the Amphicyonid Magericyon, fellow machairodonts Promegantereon and Paramachairodus, the bear Indarctos, and the small hyenid Protictitherium. While Indarctos and Magericyon would likely have been strongly competitive with <b>Machairodus</b> for food, Promegantereon, Paramachairodus and Protictitherium likely were less potential rivals. Based on its jaw gape, the largest species, M. horribilis was probably a hunter of relatively slow-moving horses.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Machairodus</b> giganteus, a large saber-toothed cat species {{found in}} Europe, Asia, Africa and North America during the Miocene and Pleistocene ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{skull of}} <b>Machairodus</b> was noticeably narrow {{compared}} with the skulls of modern pantherine big cats, and the orbits were relatively small. The canines were long, thin and flattened {{from side to side}} but broad from front to back like the blade of a knife, as in Homotherium. The front and back edges of the canines were serrated when they first grew, but these serrations were worn down in {{the first few years of}} the animal's life. [...] <b>Machairodus</b> was about 2 metres long and probably hunted as an ambush predator. Its legs were too short to sustain a long chase, so it most likely was a good jumper, and used its canines to cut open the throat of its prey. Its teeth were rooted to its mouth and were not too delicate, unlike most saber-toothed cats of the time, which had extremely long canines which hung out of their mouths. The fangs of <b>Machairodus,</b> however, were able to more easily fit in its mouth comfortably while being long and effective for hunting. Despite its great size, the largest example of <b>Machairodus,</b> M. horribilis was better equipped to hunt relatively smaller prey than Smilodon, as evidenced by its moderate jaw gape of 70 degrees, similar to the gape of a modern lion.|$|E
50|$|Nearly {{the entire}} {{proportion}} of fossils of Batallones-1 were of Carnivorans. The species of sabre-tooth cat known as Promegantereon ogygia and <b>Machairodus</b> aphanistus (the first complete skull) {{were found at}} B-1, as was Simocyon a type of red panda. In regards to the saber-tooth cats, Batallones-1 represents an ideal site for recording the percentage of specimens for which breakage of the upper canines occurred. Promegantereon, <b>Machairodus</b> and Paramachairodus are perfect examples of this at Batallones; fossils indicate {{a high number of}} canine breaks from where the teeth hit the bones of a struggling victim, indicating these early machairodonts would use their elongated teeth to subdue prey as modern big cats do.|$|E
5000|$|The name Homotherium (Greek: [...] ( [...] , same) and [...] ( [...] , beast) was {{proposed}} by Fabrini (1890), without further explanation, {{for a new}} subgenus of <b>Machairodus,</b> whose main distinguishing feature was {{the presence of a}} large diastema between the two inferior premolars ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Machairodus</b> {{is another}} genus with few fossil records {{to suggest a}} social nature, but canines on these species are broken more often than others and show signs of {{extensive}} healing afterward. A male Amphimachairodus giganteus from China housed by the Babiarz Institute of Paleontological Studies is an older individual with a broken canine, worn from usage after the break. However, the individual died of a severe nasal infection, an injury that a social predator {{would have had a}} better chance of healing, so the skull can be interpreted in different ways. The adult canine teeth of juvenile <b>Machairodus</b> took an exceptionally long time to erupt and be used, so until then, it was completely dependent on the care of its parents. The difficult feat of caring for helpless offspring has been suggested as a driving factor for human monogamy and social structures in part as human brains grew larger and, to cope, human infants were born slightly premature and underdeveloped. Other species that have especially helpless offspring, such as elephants, group for protection, but others, such as most species of whale, do not. It was likely advantageous for <b>Machairodus</b> to group together, {{but it is difficult to}} tell whether the mother alone could comfortably support her toothless cubs until they were three or four years old.|$|E
50|$|Johann Jakob von Kaup (10 April 1803 - 4 July 1873) was a German naturalist. A {{proponent of}} natural philosophy, he {{believed}} in an innate mathematical order in nature and he attempted biological classifications based on the Quinarian system. Kaup is also known for having coined popular prehistoric taxa like Pterosauria and <b>Machairodus.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Machairodus</b> is a genus {{of large}} machairodontine saber-toothed cats {{that lived in}} Europe, Asia, Africa and North America from the late Miocene to the Middle Pleistocene.

5000|$|... ==Paleoecology== As a {{predator}} at Cerro de los Battalones, Magericyon would have hunted {{many of the}} large herbivores of the {{time as well as}} the young of much larger animals. Such herbivores that it could hunt would have included horses like Hipparion, young of the hornless rhinoceros Aceratherium and the gomphotheriid mastodon Tetralophodon, the suid Microstonyx, and possibly the calves of silvatherid giraffes and boselaphine antelopes. Magericyon would have competed for such prey with the rival sabertooth cats <b>Machairodus,</b> Promegantereon and Paramachairodus, the bear Indarctos, and the small hyenid Protictitherium. While the much larger Indarctos and <b>Machairodus</b> would likely have been strongly competitive with for food and would likely have fought with it or potentially driven it from its kills when they sensed an opportunity, Paramachairodus, Promegantereon and Protictitherium meanwhile, likely were less dangerous rivals that could be driven away or fought off. Magericyon would have also wasted no time in stealing a meal from any of the smaller carnivores.|$|E

50|$|A single fossil {{specimen}} {{examined by}} Legendre and Roth {{was determined to}} have an approximate body mass of 201.8 kg. Amphiachairodus kabir was a large species from Central Africa whose size may have weighed 350-490 kg. The species Amphimachairodus coloradensis (formerly <b>Machairodus</b> coloradensis) was a significantly large animal, about 1.2 m at the shoulder, according to skeletal and life reconstructions, potentially {{making it one of}} the largest known felids.|$|E
50|$|Other prints {{show the}} {{presence}} of twenty different animal species besides the hominin A. afarensis, among them hyenas, wild cats (<b>Machairodus),</b> baboons, wild boars, giraffes, gazelles, rhinos, several kinds of antelope, Hipparion, buffaloes, elephant relatives (of the extinct Deinotherium genus), hares and birds. Rain-prints {{can be seen as}} well. Few footprints are superimposed, which indicates that they were rapidly covered up. Most of the animals are represented by skeletal remains discovered in the area.|$|E
50|$|The Mountain type, {{according}} to the reports, is larger than a lion and lacks a tail. The teeth protrude from the mouth, and the feet are hairy. The coloration is red or reddish-brown with white stripes. It {{is strong enough to}} carry off large antelopes. It is nocturnal and cave dwelling in the Ouadai district of the Ennedi mountain range. Natives described it to western explorers, who identified it as a <b>Machairodus</b> sabertooth.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, three {{different}} tribes of machairodontines were recognized, the Smilodontini with typical dirk-toothed forms, such as Megantereon and Smilodon, the Machairodontini or Homotherini with scimitar-toothed cats, such as <b>Machairodus</b> or Homotherium, and the Metailurini, containing genera such as Dinofelis and Metailurus. However, some have recently regrouped the Metailurini within the other felid subfamily, the Felinae, {{along with all}} modern cats. The last machairodontine genera, Smilodon and Homotherium, did not disappear {{until late in the}} Pleistocene, roughly 10,000 years ago in the Americas.|$|E
50|$|These new evidences {{confirmed}} that Oreopithecus was bipedal but {{also revealed that}} its peculiar form of bipedalism was much {{different from that of}} Australopithecus. The hallux formed a 100° angle with the other toes, which enabled the foot to act as a tripod in erect posture, but prevented Oreopithecus from developing a fast bipedal stride. When a land bridge broke the isolation of the Tusco-Sardinian area , large predators such as <b>Machairodus</b> and Metailurus were present among the new generation of European immigrants and Oreopithecus faced quick extinction together with other endemic genera.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} machairodontine is {{the genus}} Miomachairodus {{from the late}} middle Miocene in Turkey. There are also species of the Machairodontini found in Africa from the late Miocene to the early Pleistocene, in deposits such as Lothagam, Sahabi, and Langebaanweg. The Machairodontini moved East during the Vallesian (11.6-0.9 million years ago), when they entered Asia about 10 million years ago {{and became one of}} the major predators of this time.There were once also similarities between species found in North America and Eurasia that support an immigration event from Eurasia which took place before the late Miocene, at {{about the end of the}} early Hemphillian (~5 million years ago). The Old World (Europe/Africa/Asia) species <b>Machairodus</b> aphanistus and the New World (North and South America) species <b>Machairodus</b> catocopis (now know to belong to the genus Nimravides) were once though to have been very closely related, suggesting that there was a migration and that these saber-toothed cats did radiate from Eurasia into North America. This made sense based on evolutionary similarities between North American and Eurasian species as well as the immigration of other species between these two continents at this time in Earth’s history. However, this was disproven with discoveries that the Homotherini were not descended from the Machairodontini and that several species of Machairodontine, such as Nimravides catacopsis, Homotherium and Amphimachairodus were revealed to be Homotherines.|$|E
5000|$|The fossil species {{assigned}} to the genus <b>Machairodus</b> were divided by Turner into two grades of evolutionary development, with M. aphanistus and the North American [...] "Nimravides" [...] catacopis representing the more primitive grade and M. coloradensis and M. giganteus representing the more derived grade. The characteristics of the more advanced grade include a relative elongation of the forearm and a shortening of the lumbar region of the spine to resemble that in living pantherine cats. Subsequently the more derived forms were assigned a new genus, Amphimachairodus, which includes M. coloradensis, M. kurteni and M. giganteus. In addition, N. catacopsis was reclassified as M. catacopsis.|$|E
50|$|The first {{traces of}} human {{presence}} in Basilicata {{date to the}} late Paleolithic, with findings of Homo erectus. Late Cenozoic fossils, found at Venosa and other locations, include elephants, rhinoceros and species now extinct such as a saber-toothed cat of the genus <b>Machairodus.</b> Examples of rock art from the Mesolithic have been discovered near Filiano. From the fifth millennium, people stopped living in caves and built settlements of huts up to the rivers leading to the interior (Tolve, Tricarico, Aliano, Melfi, Metaponto). In this period, anatomically modern humans lived by cultivating cereals and animal husbandry (Bovinae and Caprinae). Chalcolithic sites include the grottoes of Latronico and the funerary findings of the Cervaro grotto near Lagonegro.|$|E
50|$|The third idea {{proposed}} is the elongation of {{the lips}} by 50%. While his other hypotheses {{have been largely}} discarded, the last is used significantly in modern depictions. Miller argues that longer lips allows the greater elasticity needed for biting prey with a wider gape. Although this argument has been disputed within the scientific community, it remains supported nevertheless by artists. Scientific criticism {{points out that the}} lips of modern cats, especially larger species, display incredible elasticity and the usual lip length would stretch suitably, despite the larger degree of opening, and that in living carnivores the lip line is always anterior to the masseter muscle, which in Smilodon was located just behind the carnassials. Regardless, reconstructions of Smilodon, <b>Machairodus,</b> and other species are shown with long lips, often resembling the jowls of large dogs.|$|E
50|$|Homotherium {{probably}} {{derived from}} <b>Machairodus</b> and appeared {{for the first}} time at the Miocene-Pliocene border, about 4 to 5 million years ago. During the Pleistocene it occurred in vast parts of Eurasia, North America and until the middle Pleistocene (about 1.5 million years ago) even in Africa. A fossil of H. crenatidens was inadvertently dredged from the bed of the North Sea, which was a flat, low-lying extent of marshy tundra laced with rivers during the recent glaciation. There has also been a discovery of 1.8 million-year-old fossils in Venezuela, indicating that scimitar cats were able to invade South America along with Smilodon during the Great American Interchange. These remains form the holotype of Homotherium venezuelensis. How long they lasted in South America is not yet evident. Homotherium survived in Eurasia until about 28,000 years ago.|$|E
50|$|Nimravides is a genus of extinct saber-toothed felids {{that lived}} in North America during the middle and late Miocene, between 13.6 and 4.9 Ma. Despite its {{scientific}} name, Nimravides {{does not belong to}} the Nimravidae, but is a true felid, belonging to the family Felidae. Nimravides catacopsis, {{one of the largest and}} latest species, was quite large, measuring 100 cm at the shoulder and was similar in size to a large tiger. It was also possessed of long, powerful legs and a long back. For many decades, it was also believed to be a member of the genus <b>Machairodus,</b> but, despite the similarities between them at first glance, based on autapomorphies in the skeleton, the two animals are too different to be classified as species of the same genus, and thus, Nimravides remains separate as its own genus within the Homotherini.|$|E
50|$|Until {{the recent}} {{discovery}} of the Late Miocene fossil depository known as Batallones-1 in the 1990s, specimens of Smilodontini and Homotheriini ancestors were rare and fragmentary, so the evolutionary history of the saber-toothed phenotype, a phenotype affecting craniomandibular, cervical forelimb and forelimb anatomy, was largely unknown. Prior to the excavation of Batallones-1, the predominating hypothesis was that the highly derived saber-toothed phenotype arose rapidly through pleiotropic evolution. Batollnes-1 unearthed new specimens of Promegantereon ogygia, a Smilodontini ancestor, and <b>Machairodus</b> aphanistus, a Homotheriini ancestor, shedding light on evolutionary history. (Though the Smilodontini ancestor was originally assigned to the genus Paramachairodus, it was later revised to the genus Promegantereon). The leopard-sized P. ogygia (living 9.0 Ma) inhabited Spain (and perhaps additional territory), and its most studied descendants, {{the members of the}} tiger-sized genus Smilodon, lived up to 10,000 years ago in the Americas. The lion-sized M. aphanistus (living 15.0 Ma) roamed Eurasia, as did its most studied descendants, members of the lion-sized genus Homotherium (living 3.0-5.0 Ma).|$|E
5000|$|Possibly {{the oldest}} known true felid (Proailurus) {{lived in the}} late Oligocene and early Miocene epochs. During the Miocene, it gave way to Pseudaelurus. Pseudaelurus is {{believed}} to be the latest common ancestor of the two extant subfamilies and the extinct subfamily, Machairodontinae. This group, better known as the saber-tooth cats, became extinct in the Late Pleistocene era. The group includes the genera Smilodon, <b>Machairodus</b> and Homotherium. The Metailurini were originally classified as a distinct tribe within Machairodontinae, though they count as members of the Felinae in recent times. Most extinct cat-like animals, once regarded as members of the Felidae, later turned out to be members of related, but distinct, families: the [...] "false sabretooths" [...] Nimravidae and Barbourofelidae. As a result, sabretooth [...] "cats" [...] seem to belong to four different lineages. The total number of fossil felids known to science is low compared to other carnivoran families, such as dogs and bears. Felidae radiated quite recently and most of the extant species are relatively young.|$|E
50|$|Several {{significant}} debates to {{this theory}} are made. In most species where such a nonfunctional trait is adopted to enhance sexual attraction, only one gender, typically males, display the feature. In all machairodont species, {{both males and}} females have these canines and, with only minor exceptions as in <b>Machairodus,</b> are shaped similarly. Most species that display a high degree of sexually driven characteristics also display more than one physical difference: size usually varies in such species. Male deer not only have antlers, they are also typically larger. Male lions not only have manes, but they also are larger. Male American kestrels are not only more brightly colored than their female counterparts, but also they are smaller. Male and female machairodonts appear to be the same size. To adopt these traits for this purpose alone, a machairodont would be severely impaired in eating and general function. The changes to allow their jaws to expand, other teeth to adjust in size and number, and skull morphology to alter significantly simply to accommodate this feature seem extreme and unrealistic to many.|$|E
50|$|If {{the modern}} lion is capable of, in large numbers, killing {{weakened}} adult and healthy subadult elephants, similar sized Homotherium likely could have managed the same feat with juvenile mammoths. This {{is supported by}} isotopic analysis. But {{the idea that a}} cat, even one of very large size and possibly social, was able to cooperatively 'drag' a 400-pound mammoth calf any real distance into a cave without damaging its teeth has aroused great criticism. Its sloped back and powerful lumbar section of its vertebrae suggested a bear-like build, so it might have been capable of pulling weights, but breaking canines, a fate suffered by <b>Machairodus</b> and Smilodon with some frequency, is not seen in Homotherium. Moreover, the bones of these young mammoths show the distinctive marks of Homotherium incisors, indicating they could efficiently process most of the meat on a carcass, indicating it was they and not scavengers who dragged the carcasses into the caves. Examination of the bones also indicates that the carcasses of these mammoths were dismembered by the cats before being dragged away, indicating that Homotherium would disarticulate their kill to transport it to a safe area and prevent scavengers from claiming a hard-won meal. Evidence also shows the cats were able to effectively strip flesh from bone in a manner that left noticeable score marks.|$|E
50|$|Machairodont means “knife-tooth” which {{perfectly}} {{describes the}} species that make up Machairodontini. These predators are related to extant cats, the Felinae, and share a common ancestor within the Felidae clade. Machairodontines are medium to large sized saber-toothed cats that would reach a size slightly larger than today's lions. This clade is also occasionally classified as {{being part of the}} Homotherini, and includes genera such as <b>Machairodus,</b> Hemimachairodus and Miomachairodus. They were first characterized by their scimitar canines in the upper jaw. This means that the canines are shorter and coarsely serrated, with vertical flattening. Although the upper canines are shorter than other more famous saber toothed cats such Smilodon, they are still abnormally long in comparison {{to the rest of the}} teeth in the mandible. There is also a space separating the canines and premolars known as a diastema. The bottom portion of the jaw contains small incisors that are in a straight row with a large, lower canine. These canines are not nearly as big as the upper canines. There is a diastema between the canines and the premolars in the lower jaw as well.These prehistoric predators not only have long upper canine teeth but they also have elongated limb bones, which differ from the squatter legs of the other group of saber-toothed cats, the Smilodontini. Although not many complete skeletons of machairodontine species have been found, those specimens known illustrate the long limb bones and shorter tails. The tails are of medium length and do not reach the ground as they do with cats today.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{excavations}} of the Robin Hood Cave {{were carried}} out by Professor Sir William Boyd Dawkins, who wrote several papers on his findings. In July 1876, the Reverend J.M. Mello discovered the decorated rib {{at the back of}} the western chamber in the Robin Hood Cave in Creswell Crags. Dawkins described it as [...] "the head and fore quarters of a horse incised on a smoothed and rounded fragment of rib, cut short off at one end and broken at the other. On the flat side the head is represented with the nostrils and mouth and neck carefully drawn. A series of fine oblique lines show that the animal was hog-maned. They stop at the bend of the back which is very correctly drawn..."After its discovery and into the 1920s, some suggested that this piece was fraudulent. Although accepted now by most as authentic, some still today suggest that the piece is a genuine Paleolithic work originating from France and fraudulently found or left to be found in the Robin Hood Cave. Similar accusations were made against a <b>Machairodus</b> or sabre-toothed cat tooth found at the same time, and equally singular among the many thousands of animal remains excavated at the site (now acknowledged as authentic). Modern scientific tests do, however, support the local origin of the tooth, which has a similar chemical profile to other local animal remains, and differs from French examples. In the 1920s, three further fragments claimed as showing engraved animals were found, but these are less widely accepted, and might be wholly caused by natural means, such as the action of roots.|$|E
