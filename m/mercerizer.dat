40|$|Textile {{industry}} {{is one of}} the most important and rapidly developing industrial sectors. It has a high importance in terms of its environmental impact, since it consumes considerably high amount of water and produces highly polluted discharge water in large amount. In this study, the pollution assessment was performed in various parts of denim processing textile wastewater in three steps. In the first step the wastewater samples were collected from the Denim processing industry. The pollution load was analysed in terms of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), pH, Conductivity, Total Dissolved Solid (TDS) as per standards. Higher Organic content in the <b>Mercerizer</b> effluent was identified which is due to the acidic nature of Neutralizing agents. As a second step, ANOVA and correlation coefficient analysis were performed to identify the significant differences, correlation between the properties of effluent respectively. In the final step the reductions in pollution load were achieved by applying suitable pollution prevention strategies...|$|E
