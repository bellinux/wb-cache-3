5|$|In early April 1945, Braun {{travelled}} from Munich to Berlin {{to be with}} Hitler at the Führerbunker. She {{refused to}} leave as the Red Army closed in on the capital. After midnight {{on the night of}} 28–29 April, Hitler and Braun were married in a small civil ceremony within the Führerbunker. The event was witnessed by Joseph Goebbels and Martin Bormann. Thereafter, Hitler hosted a modest wedding breakfast with his new wife. When Braun married Hitler, her legal name changed to Eva Hitler. When she signed her <b>marriage</b> <b>certificate</b> she wrote the letter B for her family name, then lined this out and replaced it with Hitler.|$|E

5|$|With {{the release}} of Age Ain't Nothing but a Number, rumors {{circulated}} of a relationship between Aaliyah and R. Kelly. Shortly after, there was speculation about a secret marriage with {{the release of}} Age Ain't Nothing but a Number and the adult content that Kelly had written for Aaliyah. Vibe magazine later revealed a <b>marriage</b> <b>certificate</b> that listed the couple married on August 31, 1994, in Sheraton Gateway Suites in Rosemont, Illinois. Aaliyah, who was 15 at the time, was listed as 18 on the certificate; the illegal marriage was annulled in February 1995 by her parents. The pair continued to deny marriage allegations, stating that neither was married. One particular allegation among the rumor was that Aaliyah wedded R. Kelly without her parents' knowledge.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{press release}} issued by Samuel Estimo, an {{attorney}} representing Jinky Young, the Supreme Court of Iceland ruled, in December 2009, that Watai's claim of marriage to Fischer was invalidated because of her failure to present the original copy of their alleged <b>marriage</b> <b>certificate.</b> On June 16, 2010, the Court {{ruled in favor of}} a petition on behalf of Jinky Young to have Fischer's remains exhumed. The exhumation was performed on July 5, 2010, {{in the presence of a}} doctor, a priest, and other officials. A DNA sample was taken and Fischer's body was then reburied. On August 17, 2010, the Court announced that based on the DNA sample it was determined that Fischer was not the father of Jinky Young. On March 3, 2011, an Icelandic district court ruled that Miyoko Watai and Fischer had married on September 6, 2004, and that, as Fischer's widow and heir, Watai was therefore entitled to inherit Fischer's estate. Fischer's nephews were ordered to pay Watai's legal costs, amounting to ISK 6.6 million (approximately $57,000).|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, {{however, the}} son, Clarence, {{repeated}} {{the story and}} published a book in the United States, My Uncle George V, in which he claimed {{he was born in}} London in September 1890, about nine months after Albert Victor's meeting with Mrs. Haddon. In 1933, he was charged with demanding money with menace and attempted extortion after writing to the King asking for hush money. At his trial the following January, the prosecution produced documents showing that Haddon's enlistment papers, <b>marriage</b> <b>certificate,</b> officer's commission, demobilisation papers and employment records all showed he was born in or before 1887, at least two years before Albert Victor met Mrs. Haddon. Haddon was found guilty and the judge, believing Haddon to be suffering from delusions, did not jail him but bound him over for three years on the condition that he made no claim that he was Albert Victor's son. Haddon breached the conditions and was jailed for a year. Dismissed as a crank, he died a broken man. Even if Haddon's claim had been true, as with other royal illegitimacies, it would have made no difference to the royal line of succession.|$|E

25|$|For many, the {{decision}} whether to keep or change their birth {{name is a}} difficult one. This process is expedited for newly married persons in that their <b>marriage</b> <b>certificate,</b> in combination with identification using their married name, is usually accepted {{as evidence of the}} change, due to the widespread custom, but the process still requires approaching every contact who uses the old name and asking them to use the new. Unless the statutes where the marriage occurred specify that a name change may occur at marriage (in which case the <b>marriage</b> <b>certificate</b> indicates the new name), the courts have officially recognized that such a change {{is a result of the}} common law right of a person (man, woman, and sometimes child) to change their name. However, men encounter more difficulties in changing their last names. There were some early cases which held that under the common law, a woman was required (in the U.S.) to take her husband's name, but newer cases overturned those. Women do not have to change their names by law.|$|E
25|$|While the law gives women equal {{property}} rights, traditional {{practice and}} {{ignorance of the}} law prevented women—even educated women—from taking full advantage of their rights. A community property marriage must be specified in the marriage contract. In addition, if the type of marriage was not specified on the <b>marriage</b> <b>certificate,</b> judges presumed the marriage was polygynous. Traditional practice discriminated against women in inheritance matters, and men inherited most of the family wealth.|$|E
