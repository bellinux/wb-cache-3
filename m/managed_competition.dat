5000|$|With {{the advent}} of the Clinton {{administration}} in 1993, the group began changing from being a nonpartisan grassroots organization to being a direct player in Democratic Party politics. [...] Citizen Action argued publicly for single-payer health care, but behind the scenes worked to support the <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> proposals of the 1993 Clinton health care plan as the only feasible approach. [...] This created some unhappiness among members and aligned organizations.|$|E
50|$|Despite its {{political}} failings, {{the substance of}} the Clinton Health Plan has echoes in current reform plans for the US Health System. For instance, almost all of the 2008 Democratic candidates' plans call for employer mandates, cooperative insurance pools, and <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> between health plans with a minimum benefits package. Of his Health Plan, President Clinton often says that it was politics that undermined Magaziner's efforts, not policy. It should be noted, however, that these are all Democratic endorsements.|$|E

5000|$|The {{spread of}} HMOs and other {{pre-paid}} health plans has spawned significant {{debate about the}} impact on quality of care. From the beginning, critics argued that pre-paid competitive plans like HMOs provided incentives for doctors and hospitals to [...] "skimp" [...] on care. Many have complained that the plans restrict providers’ autonomy and patients’ choice of doctors. On the left, advocates of a Canadian style government health plan {{have argued that the}} <b>Managed</b> <b>Competition</b> approach enriches the insurance industry at patient and taxpayer expense and relies naively on free market forces. Many proponents of the <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> approach, including Ellwood, argue that regulations built into the legislation have undermined the market competition that was meant to enable patients and providers to choose among plans based on quality and cost. Ellwood has repeatedly expressed disappointment with the way his concepts played out. [...] "What went wrong?" [...] he reflected in 2011. [...] "Political expediency in the initial plan designed to promote HMO growth led to the inclusion of three mistakes: for-profit plans, independent practice associations, and the failure to include outcome accountability." [...] Ellwood was particularly adamant about the last. Without measures of health outcomes, which he had advocated from the beginning, {{there was no way to}} really know how the changes in health care organization were affecting patients. More important, there was no way to ensure that patients and providers were making good decisions. And there was no way to hold health providers accountable, to ensure that they were not reducing costs in ways that hurt patients.|$|E
5000|$|Subsequently, {{when the}} Clinton {{administration}} was grappling {{with health care}} reform, the Jackson Hole Group, according to the New York Times, was [...] "one {{of the most important}} influences in the shaping of the Clinton plan." [...] The plan was called <b>managed</b> <b>competition,</b> and two of its most prominent advocates from the Jackson Hole Group were Ellwood and Alain Enthoven. In essence, the concept was that groups of health care providers and insurers would compete with each other to get the business of large cooperatives seeking insurance. In the end the Clinton reform plan collapsed. By then, the Jackson Hole Group had distanced itself due to disagreement about the degree of regulation the plan sought to impose, and Ellwood had become a pioneer in outcomes management.|$|E

5000|$|Magaziner is {{best known}} for leading, along with Hillary Clinton, the failed Task Force to Reform Health Care in the early Clinton administration, which aimed to {{implement}} a <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> regime for the health insurance industry, and to establish community rated insurance pools to cut costs for small businesses and the uninsured. The plan was widely criticized for being too complex. Pharmaceutical companies and health insurance companies waged a broad-based ad-campaign against the plan, which included the famous [...] "Harry and Louise" [...] ads. Despite the attacks by Republicans and industry associations, Magaziner did little to respond. People within the administration criticized Magaziner's blunt and domineering approach, attacking critics who disagreed instead of trying to build consensus. The Democratic congressional staff began calling him [...] "Hillary's Rasputin".|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{theory of}} <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> has found favor with many health policy analysts and {{academic}} economists alike. Three characteristics—consumer choice, defined contribution, {{and dissemination of}} information—signal <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> strategy. By requiring private employers to provide their employees {{with a choice of}} health carriers, a fixed-dollar strategy (defined contribution), and quality information to make appropriate choices among carriers, <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> offers to remedy imperfections in both the consumer and provider sides of the market for health insurance. In an extensive survey of health care purchasing practices among Fortune 500 companies we found that major companies are not using the <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> approach to health care purchasing. Instead, most of the companies sur-veyed are purchasing health care {{in the same way as}} they do other inputs to produc-tion—a pattern we call industrial purchasing. Embraced by many health policy analysts and academic economists since its inception in the late 1970 s, <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> addresses imperfections in the health insurance market for both consumers an...|$|E
40|$|This article {{traces the}} use of <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> policy to {{transform}} the NHS from an administered public service {{to a set of}} interlocking markets and contracts. It reviews the overlooked origins of <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> in the new managerialism and explains the relationship between <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> and the cost crisis of the NHS by extending Foucault's concept of governmentality to revise the concept of the state. The paper then describes how the government structured health care markets, using <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> as an instrument of governmentality. It summarises institutional responses by health authorities, hospital trusts, and GP fundholders. The terms "master institution", "dictated competition" and "coercive partnering" are introduced as new concepts for economic sociology and as strategies of governmentality. Implementation, however, led to resistance, opposition and eventual abandonment of <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> as too disruptive and costly. Yet, this analysis contends, <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> has left an enduring legacy of accountability to purchasers in economic terms such as efficiency, transaction costs, and cost effectiveness. The policies of the new government are based on coercive partnering and doctor-based "commissioning".

40|$|Israel's {{experience}} {{in attempting to}} implement a health system reform based in large measure on <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> should provide important data to other countries considering reliance on competitive mechanisms for third-party purchase of health care. In this paper, current proposals for reform of the Israeli market for third-party purchase of health care are examined in light of ideal market structures, particularly the theory of <b>managed</b> <b>competition.</b> The relationship between that theory, {{the notion of a}} 'purchaser-provider split' and the Israeli case are explored. The current Israeli health care market, which features enrollment of 96 % of the population in competing sick funds, is presented. The changes necessary to base third-party purchase of health-care on <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> are discussed. Special conditions of the Israeli health care system likely to influence implementation of a <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> strategy are considered. Beyond a 'purchaser-provider' split, the proposals call for other restructurings, such as a split between finance and insurance functions, which the standard theory of <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> does not take into account. The implications of these proposals for smooth functioning of the health care market must be weighed against political and ethical considerations unique to the Israeli environment. health insurance competition reform Israel...|$|E
40|$|Background: Healthcare quality {{information}} {{is crucial for}} the system of <b>managed</b> <b>competition.</b> Within a system of <b>managed</b> <b>competition,</b> health insurers can selectively contract care providers and are allowed to channel patients towards contracted providers. The idea is that insurers have a stronger bargaining position compared to care providers when {{they are able to}} channel patients. In the Dutch system of <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> that was implemented in 2006, channelling patients to preferred providers has not yet been very successful. Empirical knowledge of which sources of hospital {{quality information}} they find important may help us to understand how to channel patients to preferred providers. Objectives: The objective of this survey was to measure how patients rank various sources of information when they compare hospital quality in a system of <b>managed</b> <b>competition.</b> Methods: A written survey was conducted among clients of a large Dutch health insurance company. These clients underwent orthopedic surgery on the hip or knee no longer than 12 months ago. Results: Two major players within a system of managed competition—health insurers and the government—were not seen as important sources of hospital quality information. In contrast, own experience and general practitioners (GPs) were seen as the most important sources of hospital quality information within the Dutch system of <b>managed</b> <b>competition.</b> Conclusions: Health insurers should take the main finding—that GPs are the most important source of hospital quality information—into account when they contract care providers and develop strategies for channeling patients towards preferred providers. A well-functioning system of <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> will benefit patients, as it involves incentives for care providers to increase healthcare quality and to produce at the lowest cost per unit of quality.

40|$|<b>Managed</b> <b>competition</b> {{in health}} care is a model for reform that has been adopted by several states and {{considered}} as a model for national health care reform. This article assesses {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> in Florida based on the responses of essential participants in the <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> network and data from network documents. Results of the analysis reveal that the strength of the reform has been in offering small employers and their employees a wide choice of health care insurance and in providing them with information to make informed health insurance choices. In addition to increasing choice and information, the <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> network has become the small group insurance industry watchdog, applying pressure to keep the market fair and functioning. However, cost control difficulties and a continued limited access to health insurance demonstrate the weaknesses of the Florida reform. The article concludes by discussing the politicization of health care reform in Florida and the future of this reform effort in a changing political climate.

40|$|Is the {{organisation}} {{of health care}} in Britain becoming similar to that in the United States? Since the introduction of the internal market radical change has gripped the NHS. In the United States, despite the failure to implement coherent health care reform, a health care revolution is under way, driven by cost containment. At the centre of these changes is <b>managed</b> <b>competition.</b> Alain Enthoven, Marriner S Eccles professor of public and private management at Stanford University, has been the principal proponent of <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> in both countries. His writings inspired the NHS reforms in 1989 and President Clinton's advisers to adopt <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> in 1994, though ultimately he became opposed to the Clinton plan.

40|$|Background and objectives: The Dutch {{healthcare}} {{system is in}} transition towards <b>managed</b> <b>competition.</b> In theory, a system of <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> involves incentives for quality and efficiency of provided care. This is mainly because health insurers contract {{on behalf of their}} clients with healthcare providers on, potentially, quality and costs. The paper develops a strategy to comprehensively analyse available multidimensional data on quality and costs to assess and report on the relative performance of healthcare providers within <b>managed</b> <b>competition.</b> Data and methods: We had access to individual information on 2409 clients of 19 Dutch diabetes care groups on a broad range of (outcome and process related) quality and cost indicators. We carried out a cost-consequences analysis and corrected for differences in case mix to reduce incentives for risk selection by healthcare providers. Results and conclusion: There is substantial heterogeneity between diabetes care groups' performances as measured using multidimensional indicators on quality and costs. Better quality diabetes care can be achieved with lower or higher costs. Routine monitoring using multidimensional data on quality and costs merged at the individual level would allow a systematic and comprehensive analysis of healthcare providers' performances within <b>managed</b> <b>competition...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the current debates surrounding private delivery of health care services by addressing the distinctive challenges, constraints and opportunities facing for-profit and non-profit providers of long-term care in rural and small town settings. It focuses on the empirical case of Ontario, Canada where extensive restructuring of long-term care, {{under the rubric of}} <b>managed</b> <b>competition,</b> has been underway since the mid- 1990 s. In-depth interviews with 72 representatives from local governments, public health institutions and authorities, for-profit and non-profit organisations, and community groups during July 2003 to December 2003 form the platform for a qualitative analysis of the implications of <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> {{as it relates to the}} provision of long-term care in the countryside. The results suggest that the introduction and implementation of <b>managed</b> <b>competition</b> has accentuated the problems of service provision in rural communities, and that the long-standing issues of caregiving in rural situations transcend the differences, perceived or otherwise, between for-profit and non-profit provision. Understanding the implications of market-oriented long-term care restructuring initiatives for providers, and their clients, in rural situations requires a re-focussing of research beyond the for- versus non-profit dichotomy.
