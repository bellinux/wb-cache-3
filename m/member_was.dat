5|$|As one of {{the larger}} towns in the French Basque Country, Bayonne had been {{one of the}} main bases of ETA {{organisation}} there. From 1975 onwards this had prompted a reaction from anti-ETA groups. In April 1975, Mugalde, a Basque bookshop in the town, was bombed, though no one was injured. On 25 June 1979, Enrique Gómez Álvarez, an alleged ETA <b>member,</b> <b>was</b> killed by the Batallón Vasco Español (BVE), a right-wing paramilitary group active since 1975.|$|E

Nicknamed the Wild Weasel, these aircraft achieved {{a number of}} victories against North Vietnamese surface-to-air missile radars. The second crew <b>member</b> <b>was</b> a Navigator trained as an Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) to decipher sensor information and guide the pilot towards the targets. However, the F-100F was an interim solution, since its limited payload often required multiple aircraft to conduct a successful strike; it also lacked the speed and endurance to effectively protect the F-105.|$|E

5|$|Kempton and Jankowski relayed Hambleton's {{coordinates}} to King 22, a HC-130 {{search and}} rescue (SAR) aircraft operating just south of Quảng Trị. Recovering Hambleton quickly was essential, as the odds of recovering downed airmen dropped below twenty percent if the aircrew <b>member</b> <b>was</b> on the ground after four hours. But their efforts would be severely hampered by the huge number of troops and large quantity of anti-aircraft fire in the area, some of it supporting the NVA's efforts to capture and protect the Cam Lo Bridge near Hambleton's position.|$|E
