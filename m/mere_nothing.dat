60|$|Here Anne sighed, but {{contrived}} to keep {{down her}} sigh to a <b>mere</b> <b>nothing.</b>|$|E
60|$|It was a <b>mere</b> <b>nothing.</b> I felt at {{the time}} that a man who objects to a few taps on the face with a pickax is overcritical.|$|E
6000|$|... "You talk a {{great deal}} of the length of this passage, my dear. It is a <b>mere</b> <b>nothing</b> after all; and not the least draught from the stairs." ...|$|E
5000|$|Martin Luther {{argued that}} there are cases where a little evil is a {{positive}} good. He wrote, [...] "Seek out the society of your boon companions, drink, play, talk bawdy, and amuse yourself. One must sometimes commit a sin out of hate and contempt for the Devil, {{so as not to}} give him the chance to make one scrupulous over <b>mere</b> <b>nothings</b> ... " ...|$|R
6000|$|And after that, the fen-men said to each other, {{that all}} the birds upon the <b>meres</b> cried <b>nothing,</b> save [...] "Hereward is come home again!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Morrison. Well, {{not enough}} to make a true friend grin. [...] Slight colds, <b>mere</b> <b>nothings.</b> With our open fires [...] We've all the warmth and cheer that heart desires. [...] Next year we'll have a furnace in, and stay [...] Not till Thanksgiving, but till Christmas Day. [...] It's glorious in these roomy autumn nights [...] To sit between the firelight and the lights [...] Of our big lamps, and read aloud by turns [...] As long as {{kerosene}} or hickory burns. [...] We hate to go to bed.|$|R
6000|$|MRS. TWYMLEY. 'It's {{the best}} way.' In the {{important}} affairs of life {{there is not}} much that any one can teach a charwoman. 'Just a <b>mere</b> <b>nothing,</b> to wish you well, Mr. Dowey.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A <b>mere</b> <b>nothing.</b> I had a headache--gone now--and was {{not quite}} fit for a hot theatre, so I stayed at home. I asked you if you were not well, because you look so white.' ...|$|E
6000|$|After a short {{interruption}} Mr. Rushworth began again. [...] "Smith's {{place is}} the admiration of all the country; {{and it was a}} <b>mere</b> <b>nothing</b> before Repton took it in hand. I think I shall have Repton." ...|$|E
6000|$|During {{their stay}} at the coast town [...] "Monsieur Tarzan" [...] became the wonder of both whites and blacks because of several occurrences which to Tarzan seemed the <b>merest</b> of <b>nothings.</b>|$|R
40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. 2 ̆ 2 I the White Rose and that Black Candle - we are <b>mere</b> <b>nothings,</b> {{and yet we}} {{represent}} something of life and death. I the White Rose was born from a seed, grew from earth into life, and blossomed into flower. My friend the Candle has body and has life, too. Its flame is its life, and others have noted that it dies as it lives. We both rest in a dark and somber place, and we hear soft, sad weeping. 2 ̆...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because," [...] {{answered}} West, in calm, even tones, [...] "this insult is {{too great}} to be avenged by a <b>mere</b> cowhiding. <b>Nothing</b> but blood will wipe away the dreadful stain on your sister's character." ...|$|R
6000|$|Pretty and small, [...] A <b>mere</b> <b>nothing</b> at all, [...] Pinned up sharp in {{the ghost}} of a shawl, [...] She'd {{straddle}} her down to the kirkyard wall, [...] And mutter and whisper and call; and call-- [...] And--call.|$|E
60|$|A <b>mere</b> <b>nothing,</b> the Club assured him. The {{blushing}} modesty of the Autolycus Club at {{hearing of}} their own good deeds was touching. Left to themselves, they would have talked of quite other things. As a matter of fact, they tried to.|$|E
6000|$|... 'In vain, dear Miss King! I can't bear {{handsome}} men. I see his frivolity and shallowness; and for amiability, what do {{you think}} of keeping his cousin all the morning from shooting for such a <b>mere</b> <b>nothing,</b> and then sending him off for a ten miles' walk? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 1. 3. 'Tis we who, lost in stormy visions, &c. We, the {{so-called}} living, {{are in fact}} merely beset {{by a series of}} stormy visions which constitute life; all our efforts are expended upon mere phantoms, and are therefore profitless; our mental conflict is an act of trance, exercised upon <b>mere</b> <b>nothings.</b> The very energetic expression, 'strike with our spirit's knife invulnerable nothings,' is worthy of remark. It will be remembered that, according to Shelley's belief, 'nothing exists but as it is perceived': see p. 56. The view of life expressed with passionate force in this passage of Adonais is the same which forms the calm and placid conclusion of The Sensitive Plant, a poem written in 1820;-- ...|$|R
5000|$|His {{favourite}} quote: [...] "Affection {{springs from}} <b>nothing.</b> <b>Mere</b> carriage {{of the head}} may seduce the heart and win it." [...] —Mariama Ba, So Long a Letter ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have known}} it longer than you have, my dear. Besides, the <b>mere</b> loss is <b>nothing</b> {{compared}} with that which led to it. The worst {{of it is the}} overthrow of all your prospects, my dear fellow." ...|$|R
60|$|It pleased her also to know, {{that in the}} East {{one must}} use hyperbole, or else remain unheard; because the Eastern man must see a thing {{swelling}} to fill all heaven, or dwindled to a <b>mere</b> <b>nothing,</b> before he is suitably impressed. She immediately sympathized with this Eastern mind.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No,' he said, irritated, 'I don't want {{to serve}} you, because there is nothing there to serve. What {{you want me to}} serve, is nothing, <b>mere</b> <b>nothing.</b> It isn't even you, it is your mere female quality. And I wouldn't give a straw for your female ego--it's a rag doll.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{as far as}} we are concerned, Archer. But not for {{the whole}} army. I heard Doctor Alexander say just now that the {{casualties}} were about 1500, and that out of 27,000 men is a <b>mere</b> <b>nothing</b> to the proportion in many battles. The French have, I hear, lost rather less." ...|$|E
60|$|This will {{be found}} the sole {{absolute}} assumption of my Discourse. I use the word “assumption” in its ordinary sense; yet I maintain that even this my primary proposition, is very, very far indeed, from being really a <b>mere</b> assumption. <b>Nothing</b> was ever more certainly—no human conclusion was ever, in fact, more regularly—more rigorously deduced:—but, alas! the processes lie out of the human analysis—at all events are beyond the utterance of the human tongue.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's out," [...] Tommy explained, [...] "but {{there is}} a chapter in its place about--it's mostly about {{the beauty of the}} soul being everything, and <b>mere</b> {{physical}} beauty <b>nothing.</b> Oh, Mr. Pym, sit down and let me read it to you." ...|$|R
60|$|There go many elements, without doubt, to {{the making}} of one such moment of intense perception; and {{it is on the}} happy {{agreement}} of these many elements, on the harmonious vibration of many nerves, that the whole delight of the moment must depend. Who can forget how, when he has chanced upon some attitude of complete restfulness, after long uneasy rolling to and fro on grass or heather, the whole fashion of the landscape has been changed for him, as though the sun had just broken forth, or a great artist had only then completed, by some cunning touch, the composition of the picture! And not only a change of posture--a snatch of perfume, the sudden singing of a bird, the freshness of some pulse of air from an invisible sea, the light shadow of a travelling cloud, the <b>merest</b> <b>nothing</b> that sends a little shiver along the most infinitesimal nerve of a man's body--not one of the least of these but has a hand somehow in the general effect, and brings some refinement of its own into the character of the pleasure we feel.|$|R
60|$|I {{was laid}} out in my shroud in a long chair and tied down to it (I think I was tied down; perhaps I was {{fastened}} with nails). This {{part of it was}} a <b>mere</b> <b>nothing.</b> It simply felt like being tied down by three strong men armed with pinchers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! that's a <b>mere</b> <b>nothing,</b> {{compared}} with what you've got before you now," [...] he answered. [...] "Look here, I'll tell you {{a very good idea}} of how to pass the time. You take a chessboard with you and a set of men. You'll thank me for telling you that!" ...|$|E
6000|$|This was {{a damper}} to our midshipman. To rescue {{a little girl}} seemed to him a <b>mere</b> <b>nothing,</b> in the glowing state of his heroic soul at that moment, but to rescue her [...] "very big, strong, and brave" [...] father {{at the same time}} did not appear so easy. Still, {{something}} must be attempted in that way.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] said Mr. Vanstone, detaining him. [...] "Don't go. These people won't stop long. Mr. Marrable's a {{merchant}} at Bristol. I've met him once or twice, {{when the girls}} forced me {{to take them to}} parties at Clifton. <b>Mere</b> acquaintances, <b>nothing</b> more. Come and smoke a cigar in the greenhouse. Hang all visitors--they worry one's life out. I'll appear at the last moment with an apology; and you shall follow me at a safe distance, and be a proof that I was really engaged." ...|$|R
60|$|But it was ungenerous {{to ruminate}} so suspiciously. A girl not an actress by {{profession}} could hardly turn pale artificially {{as she had}} done, though perhaps <b>mere</b> fright meant <b>nothing,</b> and would have arisen in her just as readily had he {{been one of the}} labourers on her estate.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{thought it}} part of his {{consistently}} honest dealing. Had she been a <b>mere</b> child, knowing <b>nothing</b> of the world, and subject to parents, {{it might have been}} otherwise; but independent and formed as she is, it was but just to avow his sentiments, and give her the choice of waiting.' ...|$|R
60|$|Anne {{found herself}} {{by this time}} growing so much more {{hardened}} to being in Captain Wentworth's company than she had at first imagined could ever be, that the sitting down to the same table with him now, and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it (they never got beyond), was become a <b>mere</b> <b>nothing.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "He worships them," [...] {{the woman}} said; [...] "he has no heart and no pity for others. He thinks {{no more of}} blood than I do of water; but he is as tender as a woman with them. One of them was ill the other day--a <b>mere</b> <b>nothing,</b> a little fever--and he sat by her bedside for eight days without ever lying down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Her leg is fractured, and she's badly bruised," [...] he {{reported}} to Aunt Jane, who sent {{for him as}} soon as he could leave the sick room. [...] "But I do not think she has suffered any internal injuries, and the wound on her forehead is a <b>mere</b> <b>nothing.</b> So, with good care, I expect the young lady to get along nicely." ...|$|E
60|$|Behind {{the first}} line of my medical army will be a second line of able men {{constantly}} digesting new research for its practical needs--correcting, explaining, announcing; and, in addition, a force of public specialists to whom every difficulty in diagnosis will be at once referred. And there will be a properly organised system of reliefs that will allow the general practitioner and his right hand, the nurse, {{to come back to the}} refreshment of study before his knowledge and mind have got rusty. But then my Utopia is a Socialistic system. Under our present system of competitive scramble, under any system that reduces medical practice to <b>mere</b> fee-hunting <b>nothing</b> of this sort is possible.|$|R
6000|$|... "Only {{that very}} day the Earl of Brockelsby had, by quietly showing the {{original}} ancient document to his brother, persuaded him how futile were all his hopes. Who knows how many were the debts contracted, the promises made, the money borrowed and obtained {{on the strength of}} that claim which was <b>mere</b> romance? Ahead <b>nothing</b> but ruin, enmity with his brother, his marriage probably broken off, a wasted life, in fact.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shakespeare's lines," [...] {{said the}} Great Actor, as his face {{subsided}} to its habitual calm, [...] "are not necessary; not, at least, with my acting. The lines, indeed, are <b>mere</b> stage directions, <b>nothing</b> more. I leave them out. This happens {{again and again}} in the play. Take, for instance, the familiar scene where Hamlet holds the skull in his hand: Shakespeare here suggests the words 'Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him well--'" ...|$|R
