5|$|The next day, England resumed {{hoping for}} <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{happened}} on the opening day. The ground was again full, with even more people squashed in than the previous day. The sun was obscured by heavy cloud cover, further hindering the visibility of a ground without a sightscreen. The two English batsmen were initially tentative and played and missed frequently, and only two singles were scored in the first 15 minutes of play. The England team frequently looked towards the sky; as they needed to win the match and were in a good position, they hoped that time would not be lost to rain. Bradman set a deep-set defensive field as he sought to have Lindwall and Johnston contain the batsmen before the third new ball became available. In all, England scored only five runs in the first half-hour, as the two batsmen sought to survive and be set when the new ball was taken and the Australian attack advantaged. During this time the main threat to the batsmen was Lindwall, who bowled a spell at high pace and unsettled Edrich, who sparred {{at a number of}} balls. As soon as it was possible, Bradman took the new ball, and Bedser endeavoured to keep his wicket intact to shield Denis Compton and the other middle-order batsmen from having to come in against a swinging ball. During this period Bedser did not attempt to exploit his strong physique to hit the ball hard. Continuing the defensive strategy of seeing off the new ball, {{it was not until the}} 48th minute of play that Edrich reached his 50 in 193 minutes, although he did miss several attempted cut shots that went past the outside edge. However, the hosts had seen off the new ball without losing a wicket. Bedser then glanced a ball for four; England scored only 22 runs in the first hour.|$|E

With it being April Fool's Day many people thinking this was a joke {{but that was not the}} case. Kevin and Dina both addressed this over Twitter confirming that this was in fact true to fans asking. Later that evening, on Jennifer's Facebook page she released a statement confirming that it was in fact true. BT decided to eliminate all Live Eye's across the country to give fans <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they wanted. Many offered love and support over various social media accounts including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to Jennifer and the rest of the BT crew.|$|E

NME Jamie Crossan rated Gravity the Seducer seven out of ten, finding it to be [...] "nothing new", but feeling that the album's content is <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> [...] "the band have always excelled" [...] at.

500|$|For {{the fourth}} and fifth episode, Moffat planned a two-part sequel to his 2007 episode [...] "Blink", which {{featured}} the Weeping Angels. These two episodes, [...] "The Time of Angels" [...] and [...] "Flesh and Stone", were intended to be a more action-oriented than [...] "Blink", and also showed the Angels had a plan rather than scavenging. He also decided to flesh out the Angels as villains themselves and show <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they can do. [...] "Flesh and Stone" [...] ends with Amy attempting to seduce the Doctor; Moffat believed this was consistent with the character that had been built up from the first episode.|$|E

It gives me the freedom to sing as powerfully as I want and to rewrite the songs specifically for the genre." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, who was critical of the song's original version, praised the [...] "Vintage Throwback Remix". He felt it was <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the original [...] "should have been" [...] and concluded: [...] "a rousing vocal arrangement at the song's climax sells Mariah's inspirational message of perseverance and harks back to her '90s heyday."

[...] In conclusion, he said [...] "there's nothing new here and adults will be disappointed, but the latest installment of SpongeBob SquarePants delivers a lot of silly and good-natured fun for the kids and there's nothing wrong with that." [...] In the Volume 2 review also for the DVD Verdict, Dennis Prince said [...] " [...] is not the series' best work but, nevertheless, is an improvement".

500|$|Greg Mueller from GameSpot {{recommends}} {{the game for}} its value but sees it as [...] "not an absolutely essential expansion" [...] and rates some of the later quests as repetitive and uninspired. Similar comments followed from GamePro reviewer Newton, who found that it is [...] "an impressive expansion" [...] which [...] "delivers <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> made Oblivion great: creative quests, a huge land to explore, and tons {{of things to do}} there, [...] making this expansion is a solid purchase for anyone who was a fan of the core game". Jim Rossignol from Eurogamer initially rated the game as equally memorable to Oblivion but later saying that it is [...] "the same game as it ever was, only this time with a slightly weirder backdrop, and less interesting questing". Charles Onyett from IGN rates it as [...] "an entirely worthy addition to Bethesda's stellar fourth entry in The Elder Scrolls series" [...] and as [...] "a great excuse to jump back in [...] ".|$|E

500|$|The {{development}} team {{felt that}} the post-apocalyptic world and the survival horror genre gave {{them the opportunity to}} better develop the characters. Taking inspiration from their work on the Uncharted games, the team used their knowledge of paralleling characters with the conflict in both gameplay and stories when developing The Last of Us. They also took inspiration from the books The Road (2006) and City of Thieves (2008), and the film No Country for Old Men (2007), noting that they all include memorable characters and using this as a point of inspiration. [...] "e can make you as a player feel <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it's truly like to exist inside of a world where every bullet counts and each step you take is a conscious choice that's going to make or break your existence," [...] said Straley.

500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} negative. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five.

They wrote that [...] "at the centre of [...] mythology [...] a situation dependent on Mulder and a baby. One of them is absent, {{and one of them}} can't talk." [...] Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson criticized the line asking for Mulder's head, but praised the episode's teaser. M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, also complimented the teaser sequence, calling it [...] "glorious", but was heavily critical {{of the rest of the}} episode's [...] "confused and impenetrable" [...] story. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, wrote a largely negative review of the episode and derided its plot. He wrote that [...] "as this series winds down, you would think Carter and Spotnitz would be in a hurry to resolve some of the myriad of questions they've posed.
