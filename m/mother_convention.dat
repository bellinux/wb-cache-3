40|$|The {{framework}} and {{starting point for}} analyzing forest and forestry project activities under the clean development mechanism (CDM) is the historical legal and scientific international recognition of the role carbon “sinks” and “reservoirs” can play in mitigating climate change. The analysis takes off by differentiating the international legal status of forest. In delineating {{the scope of the}} study, two possible approaches to forests and forestry activities are presented: accounting with domestically forestry activities; or through jointly project-based activities. The focus lies on the latter, specifically on project activities under the CDM. Since the 1992 <b>mother</b> <b>Convention,</b> a great amount of progress was achieved. A comprehensive and analytical review of subsequent COPs and MOPs is useful research tool for further analysis. Concomitantly, those project activities undertaken during the AIJ pilot phase, showed experiences gained, the evolution of knowledge, and how this mechanism led the Parties to agree upon flexible mechanism. Based on this historical and analytical overview, assessments are possible on current obstacles, and positive and negative impacts related to CDM forests and forestry project activities. Legal and political obstacles impeding the evolution includes the United States resistance in ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, EU refusal to accept CDM forests and forestry project activities under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, and the limitation of CDM forest and forestry project activities to afforestation and reforestation. Following this track, environmental, socio-economic, social and cultural downsides and upsides can also be assessed. With that, perspectives to overcoming obstacles and adverse impacts of CDM forests and forestry project activities in upcoming commitment periods can be drawn aiming at maximizing the utilization of the CDM. This would serve not only the purposes of achieving the objective of the climate change Convention, but also the goals of other major conventions and international forums...|$|E

40|$|Background: Appropriate feeding {{practices}} are of fundamental {{importance for the}} survival, growth, development and health of infants and young children. The aim {{of the present study}} was to collect baseline information on current infant and young child feeding practices, attitudes and knowledge in Mazabuka, Zambia, using a qualitative approach. Methods: The study was conducted in Mazabuka, 130 km south of Lusaka in Zambia in January and February in 2005. Nine focus group discussions with mothers and a total of 18 in-depth interviews with fathers, grandmothers, health staff and traditional birth attendants were performed in both rural and urban areas. Results: Breastfeeding was reported to be universal, the use of pre-lacteal feeds appeared to be low, colostrum was rarely discarded, and attitudes to and knowledge about exclusive breastfeeding were generally good. However, few practised exclusive breastfeeding. The barriers revealed were: (1) the perception of insufficient milk, (2) the fear of dying or becoming too sick to be able to breastfeed, (3) convention, (4) the perception of &# 39;bad milk&# 39; and (5) lack of knowledge on the subject. The health staff and traditional birth attendants were the most important actors in transmitting knowledge about infant feeding to the mothers. Both categories appeared to have updated knowledge on child health and were well respected in the society. Fathers and grandmothers tended to be less knowledgeable on novel subjects such as exclusive breastfeeding and often showed a negative attitude towards it. At the same time they had considerable authority over mothers and children and infant feeding decisions. The rural population was in general less educated and more prone to conventional non-exclusive feeding practices. Conclusion: The message that exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) is beneficial for child health had reached the health workers and was taught to <b>mothers.</b> However, <b>conventions</b> and expectations from family members in this Zambian community were important barriers in preventing the message of EBF from being translated into practice. The deep-rooted beliefs that prohibit EBF need to be addressed in projects and campaigns promoting EBF. </p...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston University N. B. : Page 48 {{missing from}} originals. Alma {{says there are}} two copies and both copies don't have page 48. Thomas Clayton Wolfe, born in 1900 and died in 1938, is an American writer who well typifies his {{generation}} both {{in his life and}} in his works. A Southern boy who came North to live and make his reputation, he grew up in Ashville, North Carolina, a small mountain town. His mother's people were of sturdy, Scotch-Irish and English stock and had lived there many years, his father was of mixed German and Welsh stock from Pennsylvania. Wolfe was the last of their eight children, and after his parents separated was brought up alone by his mother. He attended the local grammar school, and prepared for college at a small, but progressive private school in the neighborhood. Undoubtedly the training in this school which emphasized independence of mind effected Wolfe's later career. 	Wolfe attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for four years and received his degree at the age of nineteen. Here he was a prominent student, editing the college paper in his last year and belonging to practically everything on campus. After his graduation he went to Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts where he took two years of graduate work in English, receiving a Master of Arts degree in 1922. At Harvard he took Professor Baker's famous play course, and spend a good deal of his time doing creative work. 	In February, 1924, Wolfe received an appointment to the faculty of English at Washington Square College, one of the departments of New York University in New York City, and he taught there with several leaves of absences for travel and study in Europe until 1930. In that year six months after the publication of his first novel, Look Homeward, Angel he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for creative work and resigned his position to devote his remaining eight years to writing. 	After a year in Europe during which he complete the manuscript for Of Time and the River, Wolfe returned to America and settled down in Brooklyn to write. It was at this time that he determined to go on alone and broke with his editor friend, Maxwell Perkins, who had done so much work in the revision of Wolfe's novels. The fruit of these seven years in Brooklyn were the two volumes, published posthumously, The Web and the Rock, and You Can't Go Home Again. 	In 1938 as Wolfe was setting out for the Pacific Northwest, he had an attack of pneumonia and recovered only to die September 15, 1938 of a cerebral infection at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. He was buried there in the Riverside Cemetery near the grave of O. Henry. 	Wolfe's published works include, beside his four novels for which he is most famous, two plays, an autobiographical sketch, The Story of a Novel, book of collected short stories, From Death to Morning, and lyric passages from his novels collected in The Faces of a Nation. His output was tremendous, however, for his novels are very long, running from 900 to 1500 pages each. 	Wolfe was a tremendous man with tremendous appetites. He stood six feet, six inches tall and had a large ungainly frame. He ate and drank tremendously, travelled extensively, made love to many women, and burned himself out physically at the age of thirty-eight. 	In his reactions to life in the twentieth century America Wolfe was more or less conventional for the time. He revolted against the puritanism and victorianism of the preceding age. He attacked with all the single-minded cruelty and bigotry of youth his own family, his home town, his college and his state. He criticized those who retreated to the country and those who foolishly stayed in the city; he satirized the expatriates and the over-patriotism of certain Americans; he spoke out against Hitler and his government. His rebellion against life was unfocused, unclarified; he simply struck out at everything and everyone within range. 	Wolfe, like many of the people of his generation following Bergson, Freud, and the others, put all his faith in experience. Be believed that if he experienced enough of life he would become per se wise and rich and successful in art as well as in life. It was only during his very last years that he began to realize how this theory had duped him, and by then it was too late. 	Wolfe, like the other members of his generations, sought to escape the consequences of the vastly mechanized and inhuman society which modern man has created for himself by escaping into romanticism of one form or another. Wolfe's romanticism took a very personal and intense form and it well reflected in his books as well as in his life. 	All that he saw or heard in the life around him was colored by this romanticism, by his own feelings about it, and he could not paint truly although he tried to because he did not see truly. He saw himself as a persecuted genius, a sort of Lord Byron except in prose, misunderstood by everyone, and he painted that self in his novels giving it epic proportions and wallowing in self-pity of the crudest type. 	He portrayed his other characters romantically, too. They are usually symbols or caricatures, never people of flesh and blood. Thus in Look Homeward, Angel his <b>mother</b> is one-sided <b>Convention,</b> his father is Freedom and Joy and License. And all the every-day things of life, trains and subways, food and books, clothes and jewelry are made mysterious and important in his writings. 	At long last Wolfe, disillusioned in his attempts to experience everything, defeated in his efforts to reform the world by simply shrieking at it, and realizing that he could not escape life in the twentieth century by retreating into a romanticism of the preceding era decided to accept it. This same cycle of revolt, experience, retreat and finally recapitulation has been true of many men of Wolfe's generation. Thomas Wolfe failed, or so it seems to me, as an artist and as a man because he realized too late the ineffectuality of experience as such, of revolt directed against no particular object and with no end in view, and escape into a romantic land [...] "You can't go home again. ...|$|R
