25|$|Convoy Hi-81 {{was under}} the command of Rear Admiral Tsutomu Sato of the Eighth Escort Fleet in the escort ship Etorofu. Shinyo was {{commanded}} by Captain Shizue Ishii and the Akitsu Maru was actually serving as an aircraft ferry in the convoy. The other Japanese vessels known to have taken part in the mission was the seaplane tender Kiyokawa Maru, the destroyer Kashi, the escort ships Tsushima, Daito, Kume, Shonan, CD No. 9 and CD No. 61. There was also the submarine chaser No. 156, five oilers, Arita Maru, Toa Maru, Hishidate Maru, Marii Maru, Otowasan Maru and three landing craft depot ships, Shinshu Maru, Kibitsu Maru and Mayasan Maru. The landing craft depot ships were carrying hundreds of men and supplies of the Imperial Japanese Army 23rd Division from Manchuria and were directed to separate from the <b>main</b> <b>convoy</b> at Mako and reinforce the Japanese army engaged in the Philippines Campaign. The rest of the convoy would then continue on to Singapore.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{days out}} they were {{augmented}} by five more RN corvettes. On 17 August a Luftwaffe Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor sighted OG 71, {{and the next day}} it became the first convoy to be attacked by a U-boat wolfpack. Bath fell behind while defending the convoy, and in the small hours of 19 August at 0205 hrs she was torpedoed and sunk by [...] southwest of Ireland. Three minutes later [...] attacked the <b>main</b> <b>convoy</b> about [...] west of Ushant, sinking the cargo ship Alva. The corvette [...] went to rescue Baths survivors, thus further depleting OG 71's escort, while [...] and the Irish Clonlara rescued Alvas survivors.|$|E
50|$|During the Cold War {{with its}} {{high number of}} {{military}} exercises, the military was the <b>main</b> user of <b>convoy</b> rights. Today, catastrophes like large-scale flooding might bring {{a high number of}} flagged convoys to the roads. Large-scale evacuations for the disarming of World War II bombs are another common reason for non-governmental organization (NGO) unit movements under convoy rights.|$|R
25|$|Early {{the next}} day, the Ô¨Årst {{elements}} of the <b>main</b> Spanish <b>convoy</b> {{had arrived in the}} area from Veracruz under Admiral Navarro. The English took watch and an opportunity came about when one of the lookouts spotted a lone ship; noted as being too far ahead {{of the rest of the}} convoy. At midday Centaur and Little John attacked and boarded the vessel from the rear, while the Pegasus pounded the starboard side of the ship. After a sharp half an hour fight in which William Lane was inured, the ship was taken. The captured prize was a 240-ton armed merchant galleon from Seville, the Santa Trinidad under Captain Alonso Hidalgo.|$|R
25|$|At 04.30 {{hours on}} 3 October the {{invasion}} of Kos began. By mid-day, 1,200 Germans, well-armed with light artillery and armoured cars, were ashore and in action. Dive-bombing by Junker 87s added to the difficulties of the defence, and in the afternoon Antimachia was overrun. The <b>main</b> German <b>convoy,</b> which had been attacked from air was estimated to have consisted of seven transports, seven landing craft, three destroyers and numerous caiques (fishing craft) and other small craft. The principal landings took place at Marmari and Tingachi (in the north {{central part of the}} island) and at Camare Bay (south-west) with subsidiary landings at Forbici and Capo Foco (on the north-east and south-east tips of the island).|$|R
2500|$|Receiving {{word that}} the major Japanese {{invasion}} force was approaching Java protected by a formidable surface unit, Admiral Doorman decided to meet and seek to destroy the <b>main</b> <b>convoy.</b> Sailing on 26 February 1942 with the cruisers Houston, , , , HNLMS Java and ten destroyers, he met the Japanese support force under Admiral Takeo Takagi consisting of four cruisers and 13 destroyers {{in the late afternoon}} of 27 February 1942. As Japanese destroyers laid a smokescreen, the cruisers of both fleets opened fire. After one ineffective torpedo attack, the Japanese light cruisers and destroyers launched a second and sank the destroyer [...] HMS Exeter and the destroyer [...] were hit by gunfire, Electra sinking shortly after. At 17:30, Admiral Doorman turned south toward the Java coast, not wishing to be diverted from his main purpose of destroying the convoy.|$|E

The U-boats only broke off their attacks to intercept convoy HX 79 that had arrived in the area. They went on to sink a further 12 ships from this convoy, for a total of 28 ships sunk on 18/19 October, making this the deadliest two days of the battle of the Atlantic. [...] The surviving merchants were gathered up by the remaining escorts and brought into port several days later.|$|E
2500|$|To {{camouflage}} preparations, {{the eleven}} merchantmen were loaded at Alexandria, Port Said, Suez, Haifa and Beirut, rendezvousing at Port Said and Haifa. Secrecy {{led to a}} lack of practice for the military passengers who made up damage control and fire-fighting parties and some defects in the ships' guns went unnoticed. The Port Said ships Aagtekirk, Bhutan, City of Calcutta and Rembrandt of MW11c, sailed [...] early in the afternoon of 11 June, in Operation Rembrandt, each towing an MTB. Escorted by Coventry and eight s, MW11c was to simulate the Malta convoy and steam about as far as the Tobruk meridian and turn back to rendezvous with the remainder. It was hoped that the decoy operation would lure out the Italian fleet, which would be exposed to attack and run short of fuel before the <b>main</b> <b>convoy</b> sailed. During the night five of the freighters for Operation Harpoon rendezvoused with the tanker Kentucky off Gibraltar; by morning GM4 was making [...] to the east.|$|E
50|$|The <b>main</b> assault <b>convoy</b> was {{scheduled}} to begin landing on Malta just before midnight {{on the first day}} of the invasion, after the airborne forces had already landed during the afternoon hours and secured the heights above the selected beaches. The bulk of the first-wave assault troops would come from the Friuli Infantry Division (10,000 men) and Livorno Infantry Division (9,850) of the Italian XXX Corps. Also included were 1,200 men from the 1st Assault Battalion and Loreto Battalion (both drawn from the Regia Aeronautica); two battalions of San Marco Marines (2,000); three battalions of Blackshirts (1,900) and 300 Nuotatori (a commando unit of San Marco marines specially trained in ocean swimming and beach assault). Armour support comprised nineteen Semovente 47/32 and eight Semovente 75/18 self-propelled guns plus thirty L3 light tanks (comparable in size and armament to the British Bren Gun Carrier).|$|R
50|$|The {{biggest threat}} to the vessels was the Axis submarines, {{although}} mines, surface raiders and bombing from aircraft were also much feared. The <b>main</b> countermeasure was <b>convoying,</b> large groups of merchant vessels, from 20 to 100, protected by naval ships. In 1940 the Norwegian vessels were unarmed, but slowly defensive measures like guns against surfaced submarines and low-flying aircraft were added. By the spring of 1945, around 1,700 men were registered as gunners on Norwegian vessels, and in addition there were some 900 British gunners.|$|R
25|$|The Tarakan attack {{force was}} {{assembled}} at Morotai during March and April 1945. The 26th Brigade Group was transported from Australia to Morotai by United States Army transports and arrived in mid-April {{and began to}} prepare their equipment for an amphibious landing. Due to a shortage of shipping all units were ordered to leave non-essential vehicles at Morotai when they began to embark onto assault transports on 20 April. The commander of the 1st Tactical Air Force attempted to resist this order, but was over-ridden by his superior officer Air Vice Marshal William Bostock. Most units were embarked by 22 April and the assault troops practiced landing operations for several days. A small convoy of ships carrying a force ordered to capture Sadau Island {{off the coast of}} Tarakan left Morotai on 26 April, and the <b>main</b> invasion <b>convoy</b> of 150 ships sailed the next day.|$|R
2500|$|By nightfall the English Trader {{was some}} {{five miles from}} the convoy and at times laboured to achieve 4 knots. The crew were apprehensive; a lame duck, such as their predicament was, made easy {{pickings}} for enemy U-boats and aircraft alike. The situation was made worse when, in the darkness, the convoy ahead came under attack. The night sky lit up as the aerial attack commenced. Almost as suddenly as it had started, {{the attack on the}} convoy stopped and again all around the English Trader became veiled in darkness. The next few moments were a terrifying experience for the crew with the ominous sound and shape of a Dornier Do 17 bomber attacking the ship. The gunner aboard English Trader opened up at the approaching aircraft. The crew watched as the bomber released two bombs, which [...] narrowly missed the ship. Two huge large pillars of white foam rose as high as her mast on the port side just yards from the ship. The bomber now swooped over the ship and into the darkness to prepare for another attack. Much to the surprise of the crew, HMS Vesper had broken off from the <b>main</b> <b>convoy</b> to help. Vesper opened fire on the aircraft, possibly damaging it as it broke off its attack and was not seen again.|$|E
2500|$|After {{returning}} to the patrol area with the wolf pack, she made an unsuccessful attack on a transport on 3 November. The following day, Sailfish damaged two destroyers but was slightly damaged herself by a bomb from a patrol aircraft. With battle damage under control, Sailfish eluded her pursuers and cleared the area. After riding out a typhoon on 9‚Äì10 November, she intercepted a convoy {{on the evening of}} 24 November heading for Itbayat in the Philippines. After alerting Pomfret of the convoy's location and course, Sailfish was moving into an attack position when one of the escorting destroyers headed straight for her. Sailfish fired a three-torpedo spread [...] "down the throat" [...] and headed toward the <b>main</b> <b>convoy.</b> At least one hit was scored on the destroyer and her pip faded from the radar screen. Suddenly, Sailfish received an unwelcome surprise when she came under fire from the destroyer that she had believed to be sunk. Sailfish ran deep after ascertaining there was no hull damage resulting from a near miss from the escort's guns. For the next 4 hours, Sailfish was forced to run silent and deep as the Japanese kept up an uncomfortably accurate depth charge attack. Finally, the submarine was able to elude the destroyers and slip away. Shortly, Sailfish headed for Hawaii, via Midway, and completed her 12th and final war patrol upon arriving at Pearl Harbor on 11 December. Sailfish had damaged the IJN destroyer , which had previously sunk , and also a landing ship.|$|E
50|$|Empire Advocate was in Convoy SL 69 when it {{departed}} from Freetown bound for Liverpool on 23 March 1941, {{but was unable}} to maintain speed and proceeded to her destination independent of the <b>main</b> <b>convoy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Out in the Atlantic, the {{detached}} squadrons of Nielly (French) and Montagu (British) were commerce raiding against enemy merchant shipping, but had {{thus far}} {{failed to find}} the <b>main</b> food <b>convoy.</b> Nielly encountered a British convoy from Newfoundland and took ten ships as prizes‚Äîincluding the convoy escort, the 32-gun frigate HMS Castor. Thomas Troubridge, captain of the Castor, would spend the entire campaign aboard Nielly's flagship Sans Pareil. Montagu also met with some success on 15 May, recapturing the merchant ships Nielly had taken, along with the French corvette Marie-Guiton and accurate intelligence on the direction {{and size of the}} French convoy which Montagu immediately passed to Howe. Resuming his patrol in the Mid-Atlantic, Nielly found the convoy from America a few days later, and transferred two of his ships to Vanstabel's escort to augment the convoy's defences. He then returned to the Eastern Atlantic to look for signs of British activity which might pose a threat to its passage. He also dispatched frigates to Villaret, carrying information about the convoy's location and speed.|$|R
50|$|After {{the fall}} of France in June 1940, the <b>main</b> North Atlantic <b>convoy</b> routes were {{diverted}} around the north of Ireland through the north-western approaches. By late 1940, {{the location of the}} Combined Operations headquarters at Plymouth was increasingly awkward and the decision was taken to move the Combined Operations headquarters to Liverpool. On 7 February 1941, the headquarters was established at Derby House, Liverpool, with a secondary control bunker built in Magee College, Derry. The headquarters of No. 15 Group RAF (part of Coastal Command) moved to Liverpool at the same time. On 17 February 1941 Admiral Sir Percy Noble was appointed as the new Commander-in-Chief, Western Approaches Command.|$|R

After a brief intro-duction, we distinguish three <b>main</b> theoretical approaches: <b>convoy,</b> social exchange, and individual choice. Each of these approaches addresses networks from a dynamic perspective, explaining changes in network size and composition. We discuss recent findings {{in the light of}} the three approaches, which can be seen as focusing at a different analytical level. Finally, we consider issues that remain unresolved. Network research in gerontology mainly devel-oped in the 1980 s, in the wake of findings showing the importance of social support for several physical and mental health measures (Berkman and Syme, 1979; Caplan, 1974).

5000|$|An {{agreement}} {{had been}} reached between the two armed services, whereby the Navy was to assume responsibility for convoying ships.

They argued strongly that the Combined Fleet should devote its <b>main</b> strength to <b>convoy</b> work, like the British Navy had done during World War I. In order to gain naval victory, Japan should use both aircraft carriers and island bases (the so-called [...] "unsinkable carriers") to knock out enemy warships from the air.
