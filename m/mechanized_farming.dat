25|$|Although Sudan {{has a large}} {{population}} of pastoral nomads, its fertile clay soils in the central plains have caused it {{to be regarded as}} an area of economic potential for the Arab world. With capital from international donors, in the late 1960s a programme was instituted for the large-scale, mechanized cultivation of durra (sorghum). Under this scheme, the <b>Mechanized</b> <b>Farming</b> Corporation leased large plots of land, mostly to urban entrepreneurs and landlords, and provided loans for the purchase of machinery.|$|E
25|$|The {{activity}} of foreign churches in Palestine {{in the late}} 19th century increased awareness of prosperity in the West. In Ramallah and Bethlehem, a few miles south, local residents began to seek economic opportunity overseas. In 1901, merchants from Ramallah emigrated to the United States and established import-export businesses, selling handmade rugs and other exotic wares across the Atlantic. Increased trade dramatically improved living standards for Ramallah's inhabitants. American cars, <b>mechanized</b> <b>farming</b> equipment, radios, and later televisions became attainable luxuries for upper-class families. As residents of Jaffa and Lydda moved to Ramallah, the balance of Muslims and Christians began to change.|$|E

25|$|Within the Party, {{there was}} major debate about redistribution. A {{moderate}} faction {{within the party}} and Politburo member Liu Shaoqi argued that change should be gradual and any collectivization of the peasantry should wait until industrialization, which could provide the agricultural machinery for <b>mechanized</b> <b>farming.</b> A more radical faction led by Mao Zedong argued {{that the best way}} to finance industrialization was for the government to take control of agriculture, thereby establishing a monopoly over grain distribution and supply. This would allow the state to buy at a low price and sell much higher, thus raising the capital necessary for the industrialization of the country.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the land}} {{assigned}} for sorghum cultivation by the <b>Mechanized</b> <b>Farming</b> Corporation had previously been used by pastoralists to graze their animals. One {{of a number of}} pastoral groups whose grazing grounds were encroached upon is the Rashaida in the Kassala area of eastern Sudan. This tribe emigrated from Saudi Arabia to the Sudan in the last century and, because of their relatively recent arrival, their territorial rights have been regarded as tenuous at best. However, as specialized camel breeders, {{they have been able to}} adapt themselves well to the expansion of sorghum cultivation into their grazing grounds. By using sorghum byproducts to feed their camels, they have been able to significantly increase food output per unit area.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} World War I, {{grain and}} beef prices fell precipitously. In order to stave off {{creditors}}, Colter formed the Northern Arizona Land Company, which issued $450,000 in bonds, using all of the deeded acres as collateral. However, this proved {{to be only a}} stopgap measure, and by 1924 creditors began to foreclose on different parcels of property to satisfy the notes. By the early 1930s every piece of land had been foreclosed on. In 1935 the ranch was sold to William A. Spence. The new owner moved the commissary from what is now the intersection of 4th Street and School Bus Road, to its current position.

25|$|Since {{the arrival}} of <b>mechanized</b> <b>farming,</b> the durra stalks which {{appear to be a}} nutritionally {{adequate}} type of fodder, have ensured a certain degree of security for the pastoral system. In Sudan, camels are the only domestic animals that can exploit this precarious ecological niche due to their ability to work in extreme temperatures, which can be artificially created by mechanized agriculture. Drinking spots are scarce in the area, and sheep and goats would be unable to move far enough from the few available water sources to utilize the vast expanses of harvested fields. Camels require watering approximately every six days, for which they are usually driven to the Atbara River. Camels are also able to migrate far enough north during the rainy season to utilize the only remaining non-cultivated areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} troubles {{faced by}} corn farmers {{can help to}} explain why so many farmers are losing their farms; with decreased profits, and increased production costs many cannot stay in business. These farmers {{have to move to}} find work elsewhere. Along with this, the preference for monocultural agriculture in producing commodity crops has contributed to the depopulation of many rural areas across the American farm belt. Farming used to include the cultivation of a diversity of crops and livestock on one plot of land. When agriculture revolutionized into an industry with the responsibility to produce as much of a certain commodity as possible, it became more efficient to move the animals and other crops off of the land and use the space to grow commodity crops exclusively. The large supply of corn and other grains that resulted from this change made it more efficient to feed and raise livestock in concentrated animal feeding operations indoors rather than in grass pastures; small scale livestock farmers could not compete with the output produced by factory farms using cheap corn-based feed. The simplified practice of cultivating one crop along with the introduction of the tractor and other <b>mechanized</b> <b>farming</b> equipment resulted in less of a need for labor. Therefore, the output of commodity crops from the industrialized farm increased, while the population of surrounding communities decreased. In the early 1900s one fourth of Americans lived on a farm. Currently, fewer than 2 million Americans still farm. According to the National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service, America lost 219,500 farms between 1981 and 1986. The remaining fields were merged to form larger operations. A sustainable rural community depends on the income from successful farms. If people are moving elsewhere to find work, either {{as a result of a}} failed farm or the decreased need for labor resulting from machines, the local economy suffers. With fewer people to support the economy and to provide a tax base, local businesses, churches, schools and clinics may have to close their doors.|$|E

40|$|In Poland, present {{policies}} {{are aimed at}} promoting large, <b>mechanized</b> <b>farms</b> over smaller family farms. These {{policies are}} based on the perception that large farms offer real economies of scale. But international evidence indicates that such large, <b>mechanized</b> <b>farms</b> are generally less efficient and use less labor than small family farms. The authors analyzed the relationship between farm size and efficiency in Polish agriculture. They used two different methods to do so. First they determined differences in total factor productivity between small and large farms. They then used Data Envelope Analysis to estimate scale efficiencies. The results show that, for the sample of farms analyzed: 1) large farms are not more efficient than smaller farms; and 2) smaller farms are more labor-intensive than larger farms. These results have important policy implications for farm restructuring in Poland and other transition economies facing similar issues and conditions.

40|$|Accidents {{occurring}} on <b>mechanized</b> <b>farms</b> {{have been}} a thing of concern to farmers and researchers {{both within and outside}} Nigeria. An investigation into the causes and prevention of <b>farm</b> accidents on <b>mechanized</b> <b>farm</b> was carried out in Benue, Federal Capital Territory, Kwara, Nasarawa, Niger and Plateau states that constitute the north central zone/states of Nigeria. The data collection instrument was a questionnaire designed and distributed to all the states mentioned. The questionnaire addressed demographic variables and issues linked directly with the types, causes and prevention of farm accidents. A total of 2283 tractors were available in the <b>mechanized</b> <b>farms</b> surveyed, while a total of 1014 constituted other farm machinery/equipment. Results show that 81. 7 % of accidents victims are male. About 45. 5 % of the accident victims were aged between 40 years and above. About 33. 96 % of the minor accidents resulted in slight damage to equipment and machinery. Similarly 43. 4 % of accidents resulted in substantial loss in time, while about 22. 64 % of accidents resulted in medical attention. There was no attempt made to quantify the monetary terms of the cost of each accidents, as there was dearth of information. The results obtained in this work are in agreement with the previous studies both outside and inside Nigeria. Also, from this survey work, there was a problem of good record keeping in most of the establishment surveyed. It is therefore, recommended among other things that adequate training and retraining of tractors/machinery operators should be carried out periodically, to intimate operators on recent use of farm equipment due to environmental and human factor...|$|R

40|$|Top {{soil samples}} from a <b>mechanized</b> <b>farm</b> located in Awot Uta, Akwa Ibom State in the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria were {{analyzed}} using atomic absorption spectrophotometer for their Cr; Cd; Fe; Cu; Zn and Pb concentrations. Top soil samples were also collected from a local farm situated close to the study area and analyzed for their metal contents. The following mean concentrations were observed in the mechanized farm: 0. 343 ± 0. 200 mg kg - 1 for Cr; 0. 012 ± 0. 006 mg kg - 1 for Cd; 0. 959 ± 8. 814 mg kg - 1 for Fe; 0. 031 ± 0. 011 mg kg - 1 for Cu; 0. 169 ± 0. 041 mg kg - 1 for Zn and 0. 010 ± 0. 005 mg kg - 1 for Pb. While the local farm recorded the following concentrations: 0. 115 ± 0. 005 mg kg - 1 for Cr; 0. 001 ± 0. 001 mg kg - 1 for Cd; 22. 115 ± 3. 351 mg kg - 1 for Fe; 0. 015 ± 0. 004 mg kg - 1 for Cu; 0. 098 ± 0. 008 mg kg - 1 for Zn and 0. 001 ± 0. 001 mg kg - 1 for Pb.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in three northern districts of Bangladesh during the period of 2009 - 10 to find out the effect of mechanization on labour use and profitability in wheat cultivation. The findings revealed that less number of labour per hectare is required to complete the production process by <b>mechanized</b> <b>farm</b> compared to traditional farm. Family labour is mostly affected by the mechanization. Animal power and output have positive effect on labour requirement, while power tiller and input costs have adverse effect on labour requirement for wheat cultivation.
