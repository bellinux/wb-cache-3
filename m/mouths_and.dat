5|$|Over 90% of the sicklefin lemon shark's diet {{consists}} of bottom- and shore-dwelling teleosts, including herring, mullets, mackerel, silversides, needlefish, smelt-whitings, porgies, sea catfish, triggerfish, parrotfish, and porcupinefish. Occasionally, {{they may also}} take cephalopods and crustaceans, and older individuals {{have been known to}} consume stingrays and guitarfish. This species may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Known parasites include the tapeworms Paraorygmatobothrium arnoldi, Pseudogrillotia spratti, Phoreiobothrium perilocrocodilus, and Platybothrium jondoeorum. Sicklefin lemon sharks have been documented resting on the bottom and eliciting cleanings by bluestreak cleaner wrasses (Labroides dimidiatus), during which they may open their <b>mouths</b> <b>and</b> stop respiring for as long as 150 seconds to give the wrasses access to their <b>mouths</b> <b>and</b> gills.|$|E
5|$|The tiger {{salamander}} (Ambystoma tigrinum) {{is typical of}} the frogs and salamanders that hide under cover ready to ambush unwary invertebrates. Others amphibians, such as the Bufo spp. toads, actively search for prey, while the Argentine horned frog (Ceratophrys ornata) lures inquisitive prey closer by raising its hind feet over its back and vibrating its yellow toes. Among leaf litter frogs in Panama, frogs that actively hunt prey have narrow <b>mouths</b> <b>and</b> are slim, often brightly coloured and toxic, while ambushers have wide <b>mouths</b> <b>and</b> are broad and well-camouflaged. Caecilians do not flick their tongues, but catch their prey by grabbing it with their slightly backward-pointing teeth. The struggles of the prey and further jaw movements work it inwards and the caecilian usually retreats into its burrow. The subdued prey is gulped down whole.|$|E

5|$|Arachnids lack some {{features}} of other chelicerates, including backward-pointing <b>mouths</b> <b>and</b> gnathobases ("jaw bases") at {{the bases of}} their legs; both of these features {{are part of the}} ancestral arthropod feeding system. Instead, they have mouths that point forwards and downwards, and all have some means of breathing air. Spiders (Araneae) are distinguished from other arachnid groups by several characteristics, including spinnerets and, in males, pedipalps that are specially adapted for sperm transfer.|$|E
5|$|Development of the fertilized eggs is direct, {{in other}} words there is no {{distinctive}} larval form. Juveniles of all groups are generally planktonic, and in most species resemble miniature adult cydippids, gradually developing their adult body forms as they grow. In the genus Beroe, however, the juveniles have large <b>mouths</b> <b>and,</b> like the adults, lack both tentacles and tentacle sheaths, and in some groups, such as the flat, bottom-dwelling platyctenids, the juveniles behave more like true larvae, as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents, and only attain the adult form by a more radical metamorphosis after dropping to the sea-floor.|$|E
5|$|From Alaska to Northern California, coastal {{cutthroat}} trout in sea-run, resident stream and lacustrine forms are sought by anglers. Puget Sound in Washington is a stronghold of sea-run {{cutthroat trout}} fishing with its many tributaries and protected saltwater inlets and beaches. Fly anglers search for sea-run cutthroat trout along beaches, river <b>mouths</b> <b>and</b> estuaries year round. In the lower reaches of larger rivers, anglers in drift boats float the rivers searching for trout along the wooded shorelines. In {{addition to a}} cutthroat trout sport fishery managed by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, the Federal Subsistence Management Program manages coastal cutthroat trout subsistence fisheries in Southeast Alaska.|$|E

5|$|In 2016 it was {{proposed}} that large theropods like Tyrannosaurus had teeth covered in lips like modern day lizards, {{rather than having}} bare teeth like crocodiles. This {{was based on the}} presence of enamel, which according to this theory, may have to remain hydrated, an issue not faced by aquatic species like crocodilians or toothless species like birds, which have lipless <b>mouths</b> <b>and</b> toothless beaks. Based on comparisons of bone texture of Daspletosaurus with crocodilians, a 2017 theory suggests that Tyrannosaurus and other tyrannosaurids may not have had lips at all and instead had large, flat scales that left no room for lips. The skull of Daspletosaurus also suggests that tyrannosaurids including Tyrannosaurus had integumentary sensory organs similar to crocodilians likely used in touch, temperature readings, prey detection and precise control of jaw movements.|$|E
5|$|Most fish {{exchange}} gases using gills {{on either}} side of the pharynx. Gills consist of threadlike structures called filaments. Each filament contains a capillary network that provides a large surface area for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide. Fish exchange gases by pulling oxygen-rich water through their <b>mouths</b> <b>and</b> pumping it over their gills. In some fish, capillary blood flows in the opposite direction to the water, causing countercurrent exchange. The gills push the oxygen-poor water out through openings in the sides of the pharynx. Some fish, like sharks and lampreys, possess multiple gill openings. However, bony fish have a single gill opening on each side. This opening is hidden beneath a protective bony cover called an operculum.|$|E
5|$|Petit Ferret {{developed}} Popotan in 2002. Seki Hayabusa and Iwashinichi Shimizu handled scenario development, and Akio Watanabe designed its characters {{while working}} under the alias Poyoyonâ™¥Rock. Higuchi Hideki and Kajihara Masahiro composed music for the series; Under17 contributed theme music with vocals. Petite Ferret created over 1,000 two-dimensional computer graphics for backgrounds, events, and character poses. Though only characters' <b>mouths</b> <b>and</b> eyes are animated, numerous poses exist for both major and minor characters; Petit Ferret created slightly fewer graphics for the latter to reduce production costs. The game uses a character placement system to display the characters relative to the protagonist; distant characters appear small, and grow larger as the player approaches them.|$|E

5|$|When {{they are}} newly hatched, frog larvae {{feed on the}} yolk of the egg. When this is {{exhausted}} some move on to feed on bacteria, algal crusts, detritus and raspings from submerged plants. Water is drawn in through their mouths, which are usually {{at the bottom of}} their heads, and passes through branchial food traps between their <b>mouths</b> <b>and</b> their gills where fine particles are trapped in mucus and filtered out. Others have specialised mouthparts consisting of a horny beak edged by several rows of labial teeth. They scrape and bite food of many kinds as well as stirring up the bottom sediment, filtering out larger particles with the papillae around their mouths. Some, such as the spadefoot toads, have strong biting jaws and are carnivorous or even cannibalistic.|$|E
5|$|While {{on their}} way to buy jawbreakers at the candy store, the Eds are stopped by Sarah who claims to have found her doll under her bed.

However, while they are enjoying their jawbreakers, Sarah rolls the tire in which Jonny is trapped in down a hill, knocking the three over. The jawbreakers fly out of their <b>mouths</b> <b>and</b> roll down the street, leaving the Eds to chase after them into the sunset.|$|E
5|$|Although sharks rarely bite humans, {{the tiger}} shark is {{reported}} to be responsible for a large percentage of fatal shark bite incidents, and is sometimes {{regarded as one of the}} most dangerous shark species. They often visit shallow reefs, harbors, and canals, creating the potential for encounter with humans. The tiger shark also dwells in river <b>mouths</b> <b>and</b> other runoff-rich water. While the tiger shark is considered to be one of the sharks most dangerous to humans, its bite rate is low. It is second on the list of number of recorded bites on humans, with the great white shark being first. On average, three to four shark bites occur per year in Hawaii, but they are rarely fatal. This bite rate is very low considering thousands of people swim, surf, and dive in Hawaiian waters every day. Human interactions with tiger sharks in Hawaiian waters have been shown to increase between September and November, when tiger shark females are believed to migrate to the islands to give birth.|$|E

5|$|Balaenids rely {{on their}} huge heads, {{as opposed to the}} rorquals' throat pleats, to feed effectively. This feeding {{behavior}} allows them to grow very big and bulky, without the necessity for a streamlined body. They have callosities, unlike other whales, {{with the exception of the}} bowhead whale. Rorquals have a higher proportion of muscle tissue and tend to be negatively buoyant, whereas right whales have a higher proportion of blubber and are positively buoyant. Gray whales are easily distinguished from other extant cetaceans by their sleet-gray color, dorsal ridges (knuckles on the back), and their gray-white scars left from parasites. As with the rorquals, their throat pleats increase the capacity of their throats, allowing them to filter larger volumes of water at once. Gray whales are bottom-feeders, meaning they sift through sand to get their food. They usually turn on their sides, scoop up sediment into their <b>mouths</b> <b>and</b> filter out benthic creatures like amphipods, which leave noticeable marks on their heads.|$|E
5|$|A {{research}} survey at Kodumanal has unearthed {{the remains}} of an ancient blast furnace, its circular base distinguishable by its white colour, probably the result of high temperature. Around the base, many iron slags, some with embedded burnt clay, vitrified brick-bats, many terracotta pipes with vitrified <b>mouths</b> <b>and</b> a granite slab, {{which may have been}} the anvil, have been recovered. Absence of potsherds and other antiquities has suggested that the smelting place was located outside the boundary of habitation. More furnaces were discovered at the same site with burnt clay pieces with rectangular holes. The pieces were part of the furnace wall, the holes designed to allow a natural draught of air to pass through evenly into the furnace. Many vitrified crucibles were also recovered from this site; one of them notable because it was found in an in situ position. Evidence of steel making is also found in the crucibles excavated at this site. In addition to iron and steel, the metallurgy seems to have possibly extended to copper, bronze, lead, silver and gold objects. At Arikamedu, there were indications of small-scale workshops containing {{the remains of}} working in metal, glass, semiprecious stones, ivory and shell. Kodumanal has yielded evidence for the practice of weaving, {{in the form of a}} number of intact terracotta spindle whorls pierced at the centre by means of an iron rod, indicating the knowledge of cotton spinning and weaving. To further strengthen this theory, a well preserved piece of woven cotton cloth was also recovered from this site. Dyeing vats were spotted at Arikamedu.|$|E
5|$|Mimicry of mutualistic {{species is}} seen in coral reef fish, where the models, certain cleaner fish, are greatly {{disadvantaged}} {{by the presence of}} the mimic. Cleaner fish are the allies of many other species, which allow them to eat their parasites and dead skin in a mutually beneficial cleaning symbiosis. Some allow the cleaner to venture inside their <b>mouths</b> <b>and</b> gill cavities to hunt these parasites. However, one species of cleaner, the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus), is the unknowing model of a mimetic species, the sabre-toothed blenny (Aspidontus taeniatus). This wrasse, shown in the image cleaning a grouper of the genus Epinephelus, resides in coral reefs in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and is recognized by other fishes who then allow it to clean them. Its imposter, a species of blenny, lives in the Indian Ocean and not only looks like it in terms of size and coloration, but even mimics the cleaner's 'dance'. Having fooled its prey into letting its guard down, it then bites it, tearing off scales or a piece of fin before fleeing the scene. Fish grazed upon in this fashion soon learn to distinguish mimic from model, but because the similarity is close between the two they become much more cautious of the model as well, such that both are affected. Due to victims' ability to discriminate between foe and helper, the blennies have evolved close similarity, right down to the regional level.|$|E
