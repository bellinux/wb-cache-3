5|$|Navajo rubbings {{are found}} in the satchel of a <b>motorcyclist</b> who crashed while {{attempting}} to cross the Canada–United States border. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is called into a meeting with Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.), Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), Brad Follmer (Cary Elwes) and a few unknown men. She is shown a copy of the rubbings and is asked whether she can identify them. After the meeting, Scully explains to John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) that the rubbings are similar to ones she found on a wrecked spacecraft three years prior. Meanwhile, the <b>motorcyclist</b> uses an alien artifact which begins to heal the wounds from his crash.|$|E

Hence, <b>motorcyclists</b> exiting motorcycle lanes may present the risk of collision from behind.|$|R
40|$|This study investigates <b>motorcyclist’s</b> {{willingness}} to pay (WTP) for slight injuries reduction due to motor vehicle accidents {{in the city of}} Denpasar, Bali Province, using logistic regression technique. The study found that total travel distance per day by all <b>motorcyclists</b> in the household, groups of <b>motorcyclists</b> aged between 25 and 34 years old, between 35 and 44 and between 55 and 64 years old influenced about 50 %, 36 %, 35 % and 86 % respectively on <b>motorcyclist’s</b> WTP for 25 % slight injuries reduction and about 50 %, 64 %, 65 % and 14 % respectively on <b>motorcyclist’s</b> WTP for 15 % slight injuries reduction. Total travel distance per day by all <b>motorcyclists</b> in the household shared equal probabilities in influencing motoryclist’s WTP for both 15 % and 25 % slight injuries reductions.

5|$|Meanwhile, a <b>motorcyclist</b> fires {{shots at}} the moving car of Lewis and Falsone; the two {{narrowly}} avoid injury and the <b>motorcyclist</b> escapes. Almost immediately afterward, Lewis and Falsone are called to investigate {{the shooting death of}} a woman on a nearby street. At the scene they find Stivers (Toni Lewis), who was speaking to the woman when she was shot; police later conclude Stivers was the real target. While Munch and Kellerman are leaving the hotel, somebody opens fire on them and shoots Kellerman in the arm. Falsone suggests the shooter is targeting the detectives {{who were involved in the}} previous fatal shooting of drug dealer Luther Mahoney. Kellerman becomes angry when Falsone questions the report of Mahoney's death, which indicates Kellerman shot Mahoney to save Lewis; Falsone said autopsy reports indicate Mahoney was beaten badly.|$|E

40|$|This {{study has}} objectively focused on {{assessing}} {{the effectiveness of}} <b>motorcyclists</b> training program in reducing road accidents. With the specific objectives of assessing the <b>motorcyclists</b> training programs curriculum, assessing the competence of staffs providing training to <b>motorcyclists</b> and determining the attitude of <b>motorcyclists</b> towards training. The problem being the increase of road accidents involving motorcycles {{as a result of}} lack of training on road safety by <b>motorcyclists.</b> The study based on descriptive research, was conducted in Mwanza region with all it districts involved in this study. The study involved a sample of 367 of commercial <b>motorcyclists,</b> formally and informally trained. It also involved interviewing of instructors from driving schools and officers from traffic department of Mwanza police force. It was concluded that the curriculums have got accredited time and contents however there is no standard curriculum for <b>motorcyclists</b> training program in Tanzania, <b>Motorcyclist’s</b> instructors are competent and qualified. Formal training was perceived by respondents to be an effective remedy for reducing motorcyclists’ accidents. It is recommended that, training institutions in Tanzania should sit together to set standard curriculum and Institutions should find means to increase training facilities and equipments. Government should make advertisement on TV and radio on the importance of training. While police force should continue to enforce the law on road use so as {{to make sure that all}} <b>motorcyclists</b> riding on road with other traffic have got training...|$|R

50|$|The Federation of European <b>Motorcyclists</b> (FEM) was a motorcycling {{advocacy}} {{group based in}} Brussels, Belgium. It was formed in 1988 by representatives of various national motorcyclists' representative organisations {{at a meeting in}} Strasbourg which followed the 'Eurodemo' of that year, a major demonstration by <b>motorcyclists</b> against what they perceived to be anti-biker European legislation. FEM's first General Secretary was the Briton Frank Pearson who served in the post until 1992 when he was succeeded by another Briton, Simon Milward. The Federation of European <b>Motorcyclists</b> merged with the European Motorcyclists' Association on 10 January 1998 to form the Federation of European <b>Motorcyclists</b> Associations (FEMA).|$|R
40|$|<b>Motorcyclists</b> are {{vulnerable}} in traffic. A popular measure to reduce crash risk is motorcycle training. However, {{there is little}} evidence for the effectiveness of training. SWOV therefore evaluated the ‘Risk’ advanced training course of the Royal Dutch <b>Motorcyclists</b> Association (KNMV). This one-day course teaches <b>motorcyclists</b> to recognize, analyse, and anticipate potential traffic hazards. Results from the two-year evaluation indicate that the ‘Risk’ training has a positive effect on safe riding behaviour and hazard perception of <b>motorcyclists</b> in the short term (the first few months after training). Even in the long term (one year to eighteen months after training) ‘Risk’ trained <b>motorcyclists</b> showed safer traffic behaviour than a control group without ‘Risk’ training. This is a remarkable result, because until now no studies were found that scientifically establish positive effects of an advanced rider training course...|$|R

5|$|On 8 August 1993, Mills and Mincione {{walked to}} the corner of De Vere Gardens and Kensington Road, London, but while {{crossing}} Kensington Road, Mills was knocked down by a police motorcycle, the last in a convoy of three, which was responding to an emergency call. Mills suffered crushed ribs, a punctured lung, and the loss of her left leg 6inches below the knee; a metal plate was later attached to her pelvis. In October 1993, she had another operation that further shortened her leg. Mills was awarded £200,000 by the police authority as recompense for her injuries, even though the police <b>motorcyclist,</b> PC Osbourne, was later cleared by magistrates of driving without due care and attention. After the accident, Mills sold her story to the News of the World, and gave other interviews, saying she earned £180,000. She used the money to set up the Heather Mills Health Trust (existed 2000–2004) which delivered prosthetic limbs to people, particularly children, who had lost limbs after stepping on landmines. Mills often shows people her prosthetic leg, once taking it off during an interview on the American talk show Larry King Live, in 2002.|$|E
5|$|P. R. Brown {{directed}} this video, which premiered on VH1 Classic on 8 August 2006. There are {{similarities between}} the video for Meat Loaf's version of the song, and that the video for that of Celine Dion, with Meat Loaf being haunted {{by the memory of}} his lover. It is structured differently, however, with the story being told through flashback. Shots when Raven's character is alive have a distinct yellow tint, with a darker, blue tint for those after her death. Whereas the <b>motorcyclist</b> dies before the first verse in the Dion version, Raven's crash and resulting death is not shown until the final chorus. Meat Loaf becomes angry with Raven because the ghost of Raven's former lover appears at a masquerade ball they are attending (some reviewers have compared this to the Stanley Kubrick film Eyes Wide Shut).|$|E
5|$|Voss, an avid <b>motorcyclist,</b> had {{a love of}} {{machinery}} {{that led him to}} consort with his enlisted mechanics, Karl Timms and Christian Rueser; he was even on a first name basis with them. In time, they would transfer squadrons to accompany him. Voss contravened uniform regulations at times and could often be found in the hangar working on his machine beside the mechanics, dressed in a grubby jacket without insignia. His care extended to his craft's exterior; he adorned his Albatros D.III with both a swastika and a heart for good luck. And although he was a casual dresser around his home airfield, when flying he would be well-dressed with a silk shirt beneath his aviation gear. He joked {{that he wanted to be}} presentable to the girls of Paris if he were captured; however, the shirt's silk collar protected his neck from chafing while he swivelled his head about watching for other aircraft during flight.|$|E
50|$|The {{roads that}} run {{in and around}} the town are popular among <b>motorcyclists</b> since nearby {{mountains}} provide nearly 500 curves to navigate. The most popular road for <b>motorcyclists</b> is US-421,which offers many challenging curves.|$|R
40|$|<b>Motorcyclists</b> and a matched {{group of}} non-motorcycling car drivers were {{assessed}} on behavioral measures known {{to relate to}} accident involvement. Using a range of laboratory measures, we found that <b>motorcyclists</b> chose faster speeds than the car drivers, overtook more, and pulled into smaller gaps in traffic, though they did not travel any closer to the vehicle in front. The speed and following distance findings were replicated by two further studies involving unobtrusive roadside observation. We suggest that the increased risk-taking behavior of <b>motorcyclists</b> was only likely to account for {{a small proportion of}} the difference in accident risk between <b>motorcyclists</b> and car drivers. A second group of <b>motorcyclists</b> was asked to complete the simulator tests as if driving a car. They did not differ from the non-motorcycling car drivers on the risk-taking measures but were better at hazard perception. There were also no differences for sensation seeking, mild social deviance, and attitudes to riding/driving, indicating that the risk-taking tendencies of <b>motorcyclists</b> did not transfer beyond motorcycling, while their hazard perception skill did.

5|$|Though {{sentenced to}} six years in prison, Francisco Rafael was {{released}} on 4 March 2008 {{after a year and}} five months behind bars. His lawyer confirmed that he was released for the time he had previously served in Mexico. Once released, he was deported to Mexico through the Paso del Norte International Bridge ("Santa Fe") international bridge in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, and El Paso, Texas. He had no pending charges in his home country. Mexican authorities watched Francisco Rafael from a distance as he merged through the multitude of people close to the border. It was unknown if his family was notified of his deportation but the authorities allege that shortly after his arrival he took a flight to Tijuana to see his wife and children. Upon his arrival, Francisco Rafael moved to Mazatlán before deciding to move to Los Cabos, a resort town in the Baja California peninsula. The former drug lord lived there with his wife in Cumbres del Tezal, an upper-middle-class neighborhood on a hill and with view towards the Arco de Cabo San Lucas. Instead of his actual name, Francisco Rafael went by his pseudonym Mauro Vázquez, and posed as a businessman, avid <b>motorcyclist,</b> and music producer.|$|E

40|$|An {{observational}} study, {{focusing on}} <b>motorcyclists,</b> was conducted between June and August 2012 at access points on straight road sections of primary roads in Malaysia. This {{was done in}} order to gain more insight into the actual road traffic situation at these sites. The majority of the <b>motorcyclists</b> kept to the speed limit and lowered speed when approaching an access point, especially when road users were on it. However, when the primary road traffic volume was high, they maintained higher speeds compared to other vehicles. The behavioral observations revealed a risky right turning movement, i. e. Opposite Indirect Right Turn (OIRT), from the access point into the primary road. <b>Motorcyclists</b> generally had a high compliance rate of helmet (except for female <b>motorcyclists)</b> and headlight usage. <b>Motorcyclists</b> attempting to enter the primary road were poor at utilizing the turning indicator. They were observed not to turn their heads to look for vehicles when entering a road with a low volume of traffic, compared to entering a road with a high volume of traffic. Most of the <b>motorcyclists</b> did not comply with the stop line rule, especially those who made the OIRT. <b>Motorcyclists</b> entering from the access point are involved in serious traffic conflicts to about the same extent as other vehicles. Moreover, <b>motorcyclists</b> who stopped at the stop line and made a right turn into the primary road by accepting a short gap, resulting in a time lag of less than 4 s, were involved in the majority of the serious conflicts...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{reported}} research {{was to examine the}} perceptions of road user safety amongst different road users and examine the link between attitudes, empathy and skill in motorcycle safety behaviour. <b>Motorcyclists</b> were perceived by the study participants, members of the public at four different locations at the UK (including <b>motorcyclists</b> and non-motorcyclists), as a group be at a high risk of accidents on the road. This was due to perceived behavioural characteristics of <b>motorcyclists</b> – who were viewed as ‘thrill seekers’ - as well as observed behaviours on the road. This, coupled with the physical vulnerability and excessive speeds, meant that motorbike driving was considered by the study participants as the least safe forms of road use. There was broad agreement that motorcycling was dangerous as a whole, but not all <b>motorcyclists</b> were necessarily risky riders. The issue of ‘competitive space’ emerged between car driver and <b>motorcyclists</b> in particular and it was suggested that {{there was a lack of}} mutual awareness and considerations between the two groups. Generally, greatest empathy comes from drivers who are <b>motorcyclists</b> themselves. Engineering, education, enforcement interventions were investigated. These were aimed at two main areas: normalising safer driving behaviours for <b>motorcyclists</b> and increasing awareness of bikes for motorists – particularly in relation to reducing speed limits at urban junctions. Finally, the idea of risk mapping and reduced speed limits on rural roads was seen as potentially effective – particular as certain <b>motorcyclists</b> highlighted that they changed their riding behaviours by increasing speed and taking greater risks on these roads...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a {{significant}} increase in mortality among <b>motorcyclists,</b> especially older riders (40 + years). However, few studies have compared the nature and severity of injuries sustained by older vs. younger cyclists. The purpose of this analysis was to determine differences, if any, in injury patterns to older vs. younger <b>motorcyclists</b> and to explore rider, vehicle, and environmental factors associated with these differences. Older riders were found to have a significantly higher incidence of thoracic injury, especially multiple thoracic injuries, and specifically multiple rib fractures. Older <b>motorcyclists</b> {{were also more likely to}} ride larger motorcycles, and were more involved in collisions involving overturning or striking highway structures. Large engine sizes were associated with increased risk of head and thoracic injuries, but not abdominal injuries. The magnitude of increased risks related to 1000 + cc engine size was higher among older <b>motorcyclists</b> than younger <b>motorcyclists...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective/Background: Riding {{motorcycles}} is {{a popular}} means of community mobility in many Asian and developing countries. However, the potential harm associated with accidents is greater for <b>motorcyclists</b> and their passengers than for other vehicle users. The primary aims {{of this study were}} to explore the relationship between driving-violation behaviours and perceptions of the risk associated with potential accident causes, and to assess the contribution of these factors to active involvement in accidents among Chinese <b>motorcyclists.</b> Methods: A total of 621 Chinese <b>motorcyclists</b> were recruited. All were asked to fill in a specially developed questionnaire to assess their driving-violation behaviours and perceptions of potential causes of motorcycle accidents. Results: A relationship was identified between driving-violation behaviours and risk perceptions. Furthermore, both were significant predictors of involvement in motorcycle accidents. The <b>motorcyclists</b> involved in accidents demonstrated more aggressive and ordinary driving-violation behaviours. In addition, these <b>motorcyclists</b> exhibited lower perceptions of risk from both driving and environmental factors. Instead, these <b>motorcyclists</b> were more likely to identify risk in terms of belief-related causes. Conclusion: This study could assist occupational-therapy practitioners involved in driving rehabilitation and training to identify strategies to deal with drivers' violation behaviours and risk perception. It could also provide evidence-based recommendations for drivers' education, driving-safety campaigns, or even licensing policies. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R
