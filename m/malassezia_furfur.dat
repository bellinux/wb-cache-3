25|$|Older {{literature}} {{cites the}} fungus <b>Malassezia</b> <b>furfur</b> (previously known as Pityrosporum ovale) {{as the cause}} of dandruff. While this species does occur naturally on the skin surface of both healthy people and those with dandruff, in 2007 it was discovered that the responsible agent is a scalp specific fungus, Malassezia globosa, that metabolizes triglycerides present in sebum by the expression of lipase, resulting in a lipid byproduct oleic acid. During dandruff, the levels of Malassezia increase by 1.5 to 2 times its normal level. Oleic acid penetrates the top layer of the epidermis, the stratum corneum, and evokes an inflammatory response in susceptible people which disturbs homeostasis and results in erratic cleavage of stratum corneum cells.|$|E

5000|$|Dermatophytes are {{a type of}} fungus that invades the {{top layer}} of the skin, hair, or nails. There are three genera of fungi {{commonly}} implicated: Trichophyton (found in skin, nail, and hair infections), Epidermophyton (skin and nail infections), and Microsporum (skin and hair infections).Dermatophytes produce an infection commonly known as ringworm or tinea. It can appear as [...] "jock itch" [...] in the groin or inner thighs (tinea cruris); on the scalp and hair (tinea capitis) resulting in brittle hair shafts that fall out easily. Tinea unguium affects the nails and athletes foot (tinea pedis) affects the feet.

In a study conducted to further elucidate ciclopirox's mechanism, several Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants were screened and tested. Results from interpretation {{of the effects of}} both the drug treatment and mutation suggested that ciclopirox may exert its effect by disrupting DNA repair, cell division signals and structures (mitotic spindles) as well as some elements of intracellular transport.It acts by inhibiting the membrane transfer system by interrupting the Na+ K+ ATPase. [...] It is currently being investigated as an alternative treatment to ketoconazole for seborrhoeic dermatitis as it suppresses growth of the yeast <b>Malassezia</b> <b>furfur.</b> Initial results show similar efficacy to ketoconazole with a relative increase in subjective symptom relief due to its inherent anti-inflammatory properties.|$|E

40|$|Background & Aim: <b>Malassezia</b> <b>furfur</b> is a {{lipophilic}} yeast and {{is known}} as the agent of skin diseases, especially tinea versicolor. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the antifungal effect of licorice root, Althoca officinalis extracts and ketoconazole on <b>Malassezia</b> <b>furfur.</b> Methods: In this study, the antifungal effect of ethanolic extracts of Althoca officinalis root and licorice and ketoconazole on <b>Malassezia</b> <b>furfur</b> was evaluated by broth dilution method. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum concentration of fatality (MFC) for each of the compounds was calculated according to visual reading and the number of fungal colonies (CFU) compared with the control group.

Results: MIC range of Althoca officinalis flower, Althoca officinalis root, licorice root extracts and ketoconazole was determined as: 18. 25, 300, 500 and 2. 65 µg/ml. MFC range for extracts of Althoca officinalis flower and ketoconazole was determined as: 50 ≤ and 32 ≤ µg/ml.

40|$|Background: The {{etiologic}} role of <b>Malassezia</b> <b>furfur</b> in onychomycosis, {{because of}} its controversial keratinolytic ability, has not been proven. The most reported cases are distal subungual onychomycosis (DSO). In our knowledge no cases of proximal onychomycosis (PO) has been reported. For {{the first time we}} report proximal onychomycosis. This case report describes the isolation of <b>Malassezia</b> <b>furfur</b> from fingernails. Case presentation: An Iranian 56 - year- old women had been referred to mycology lab with hyperkeratosis in proximal regions of right hand nails and clinical diagnosis of onychomycosis without paronychia in May 2012. She used several medicines for her cardiac disease, mental illness, severe stress and blood glucose fluctuation diseases. Scraping and sampling from nail lesions were done, budding yeast cells with broadband connections were observed in 15 % KOH wet mounts. Also, other differentiation tests, consist of staining with methylen blue, cultures and biochemical tests were done. In order to rejecting the probable etiologic role of any dermatophytic or non-dermatophytic fungi in this case, samples were collected {{from other parts of the}} body by scotch tape and scraping with scalpel blade too, but the results of direct microscopy and culture were negative. Finally, <b>Malassezia</b> <b>furfur</b> was identified as the causative agent of onychomycosis. Conclusion: Despite failure to prove <b>Malassezia</b> <b>furfur</b> keratinolytic ability, it can be the etiologic agent of proximal onychomycosis that shows the aggressive properties of this species. Its clinical importance is the easier transmission to hospitalized patients and other people...|$|E
