5|$|Shecky Greene {{took the}} lead first and led for the {{majority}} of the first seven furlongs. Sham {{took the lead}} from Shecky Greene near the three quarter mile <b>mark.</b> <b>As</b> the horses entered the homestretch, Secretariat passed Sham in the final furlong and distanced himself to consolidate his lead. Secretariat would go on to win the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes in the succeeding weeks, thus becoming the ninth horse to complete the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the race}} was {{abandoned}} after twelve total laps, it did not reach official status; IndyCar does not consider a race official unless it reaches the halfway <b>mark.</b> <b>As</b> such, no points were awarded and the series championship went to Franchitti by default. If the race had continued and reached official status, Franchitti {{would have been the}} series champion anyway as he had avoided the accident. Power's car, meanwhile, was heavily damaged in the lap 11 crash {{to the point where he}} would not have been able to continue racing.|$|E

5|$|Daniels and Schur {{wrote the}} script for the pilot episode in mid-2008. The {{original}} script portrayed Leslie and <b>Mark</b> <b>as</b> slightly less likable than they appeared in the final draft. For example, in the premiere episode, Mark asks Ron to greenlight the park because he is inspired by Leslie's optimism and wants to help her. In the original script, Mark intervened because he was attracted to Ann and wanted an excuse to keep seeing her. The characters were made more likable in response to feedback the episode received from focus groups and press tour screenings. The first-season episodes were written and developed relatively quickly after each other, and Schur said the staff was treating the entire six-episode season {{as if it was}} one television pilot. When the season concluded, the writers had not decided what would happen with the developing romantic plotlines between Leslie and Mark, or Mark and Ann.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{received}} the post-score kickoff, then went three-and-out. Virginia Tech recovered the kick at its 35-yard line, {{and began a}} drive that needed only three plays to score a touchdown. The key effort was a 51-yard sprint by running back Darren Evans, which advanced {{the ball to the}} Florida State 9-yard line. The score and extra point pushed Tech's lead to 14–3 with 4:37 remaining. Florida State responded with a quick touchdown drive of its own. From its 32-yard line, the Seminoles needed only six plays, three of them passes from E. J. Manuel, to reach the end zone. The score with 1:52 remaining trimmed Tech's lead to 14–10 at the 1:52 <b>mark.</b> <b>As</b> the quarter came to an end, Virginia Tech {{received the}} post-score kickoff and advanced the ball to its 22-yard line before the final seconds ticked off the clock and the first quarter ended with Tech leading 14–10.|$|E
5|$|Kershaw {{made his}} seventh {{straight}} opening day start, tying Don Sutton for most consecutive opening day starts, and Sutton and Don Drysdale for most total opening day starts by a Dodger. On June 2, {{he struck out}} Jonathan Villar of the Milwaukee Brewers for his 2,000th career strikeout. He was the fifth youngest player in major league history to reach that <b>mark,</b> <b>as</b> well as the second fastest pitcher to 2,000 strikeouts, accomplishing the feat in 277 games (behind Randy Johnson's 262 games). He was named to his seventh straight all-star game, second most in Dodgers history after Drysdale. On July 23, Kershaw left the game due to back tightness. The same day, he {{was placed on the}} 10-day disabled list. He returned to the mound on September 1, but despite his extended absence, he went on to lead the National League in earned run average and wins. In 27 starts, he was 18–4 with a 2.31 ERA and 202 strikeouts.|$|E

5|$|Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney was {{developed}} {{by a team of}} seven people, and took ten months to make. It was directed by Shu Takumi and produced by Atsushi Inaba, with music by Masakazu Sugimori, character design by Kumiko Suekane, and art by Tatsuro Iwamoto. In 2000, after Takumi had finished his work on Dino Crisis 2, his boss at the time, Shinji Mikami, gave him six months to create any type of game he wanted to.

5|$|Rivera's 2008 {{season was}} one of his best {{individual}} years. Along with a 1.40ERA and 39saves in 40opportunities, he set career bests in multiple statistical categories, including WHIP (0.67), on-base plus slugging (OPS)-against (.422), batting average against (.165), save percentage (97.5%), walks (6), earned runs (11), and blown saves (1). He averaged 9.81strikeouts per 9 innings pitched, his best <b>mark</b> <b>as</b> a closer. He pitched with such control that his 12.83strikeout-to-walk ratio made him the second MLB pitcher ever to record a figure that high in a season (minimum 50innings pitched). He placed fifth in the AL Cy Young Award voting.|$|E
5|$|Several {{managers}} {{have won the}} award in a season when they led their team to 100 or more wins.

Sparky Anderson and Tony La Russa finished with identical 104–58 records in 1984 and 1988, respectively. Three National League managers, including Dusty Baker, Whitey Herzog, and Larry Dierker, have exceeded the century <b>mark</b> <b>as</b> well.

5|$|Since its introduction, {{the euro}} {{has been the}} second most widely held {{international}} reserve currency after the U.S. dollar. The share of the euro as a reserve currency increased from 18% in 1999 to 27% in 2008.

The euro inherited and built {{on the status of}} the Deutsche <b>Mark</b> <b>as</b> the second most important reserve currency. The euro remains underweight as a reserve currency in advanced economies while overweight in emerging and developing economies: according to the International Monetary Fund the total of euro held as a reserve in the world at the end of 2008 was equal to $1.1trillion or €850 billion, with a share of 22% of all currency reserves in advanced economies, but a total of 31% of all currency reserves in emerging and developing economies.|$|E

5|$|The Lady Vols {{returned}} home and resumed their SEC schedule against in-state foe Vanderbilt, who was {{ranked in the}} top 10. Throughout the first half, the game was about even, until the Lady Vols got a slight lead with under seven minutes left, which they took to the locker room, 37–31. The second half, however, started out much differently, beginning with a 20–0 Lady Vols run. Tennessee led by as many as 35 points in the game, and ended the game with an 86–54 win. Catchings was named the SEC Player of the Week for her role in the DePaul and Vanderbilt games, scoring 35 and 22 points respectively. The final game of the month was the rematch with Georgia. It ended up being a blowout. Tennessee shot better than 60%, and Holdsclaw scored more points in the first half than the entire Georgia team. Tennessee broke the 20-steal <b>mark,</b> <b>as</b> well as the 100-point mark, winning 102–43.|$|E

5|$|The {{series was}} created by Shu Takumi, who wrote and {{directed}} the first three games.

The game was designed to be simple, as Takumi wanted it to be easy enough for even his mother to play. It was originally going to be a detective game, with Phoenix being a private investigator, but at one point Takumi realized that finding and taking apart contradictions was not related to detective work, and felt that the main setting of the game should be courtrooms.|$|E
5|$|In the 2011 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament, Temple Owls {{received}} a two seed {{by virtue of}} a 14–2 conference record and earned a bye into the quarterfinals.

5|$|The book {{opens with}} Harry seeing Frank Bryce {{being killed by}} Lord Voldemort in a vision, and is awoken by his scar hurting. The Weasleys then take Harry and Hermione Granger to the Quidditch World Cup, using a Portkey, to watch Ireland versus Bulgaria, with Ireland {{emerging}} victorious. There, Harry meets Cedric Diggory, who is attending the match with his father. After the match, Voldemort's followers attack the site, destroying spectators' tents and wreaking havoc. The Dark Mark gets fired into the sky, {{which leads to a}} panic since {{it is the first time}} the sign has been seen in 13 years. Winky, Barty Crouch Senior's house elf, is falsely accused of casting the Mark after she is found holding Harry's wand, which is revealed to have been used to cast the <b>Mark,</b> <b>as</b> Harry had lost it during the chaos of the Death Eaters' attack. Hermione, angry at this injustice, forms a society to promote the rights of house elves known as S.P.E.W. (Society for the Promotion of Elvish Welfare).|$|E
5|$|While {{teaching}} bacteriology at Maryland, Faber {{also held}} coaching duties. He {{served as the}} head coach for the Maryland lacrosse team from 1928 to 1963. During his tenure, Faber's lacrosse teams compiled a 249–57 record and secured eight outright or shared USILA national championships and nine Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championships. From 1930 onward, Faber shared coaching duties with Albert Heagy, with the former running the offense and the latter the defense. In 1936, Faber led Maryland to capture the first Wingate Memorial Trophy, the national championship bestowed by the USILA. The following year, they shared the title with Princeton. In the inaugural North-South Senior All-Star Game in 1940, Faber coached the South team, which lost to the North team coached by Princeton's William F. Logan, 6–5. He also coached all-star teams in 1946 and 1956. In 1955 and 1956, Faber led Maryland to back-to-back 11–0 seasons, with the only close matches coming against period powerhouse Navy, in 1955, and the highly successful Mount Washington Lacrosse Club, 12–11 in 1956. In 1959, Maryland finished with a 10–1 <b>mark</b> <b>as</b> USILA co-champions alongside Army and Johns Hopkins, and Faber was named the USILA Coach of the Year.|$|E
5|$|In May 1955, Edwards was {{selected}} for the England squad which travelled to mainland Europe for matches against France, Portugal and Spain, starting all three matches. Upon returning from the tour, he began a two-year stint in the British Army with the Royal Army Ordnance Corps. Army service was compulsory at the time for all men of his age under the National Service scheme. He was stationed at Nesscliffe near Shrewsbury along with team-mate Bobby Charlton, but was allowed leave to play for United. He also took part in army matches, and in one season played nearly one hundred matches in total. In the 1955–56 season, despite missing nearly two months of action due to a severe bout of influenza, Edwards played 33 times as United won the championship of the Football League {{by a margin of}} 11 points from Blackpool. The following season, he made 34 league appearances, taking his total past the 100 <b>mark,</b> <b>as</b> United won a second consecutive league title, and was also in the team that contested the 1957 FA Cup Final, in which United missed out on the Double after a 2–1 defeat to Aston Villa. He also made seven appearances during United's first ever foray into the European Cup, including a 10–0 win over Anderlecht which remains the club's biggest ever margin of victory. By now he was also a regular in the England team, featuring in all four of England's qualifying matches for the 1958 World Cup and scoring two goals in the 5–2 win over Denmark on 5 December 1956. He was expected to be a key player for England in the World Cup finals, and was seen as a likely candidate to replace the veteran Billy Wright as national team captain.|$|E
