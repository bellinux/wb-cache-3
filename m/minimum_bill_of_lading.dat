50|$|When the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> {{is used as}} a {{document}} of title, it is particularly related to the case of buyer. When the buyer is entitled to received goods from the carrier, <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> in this case performs as document of title for the goods. There are two types <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> that can perform as document of title. They are straight <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> and order <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> Straight <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> is a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> issued to a named consignee that is not negotiable. In this case, the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> should be directed only to one specific consignee indicated on the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> Order <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> is the opposite from a straight <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> and there is no specific or named consignee. Therefore, an order <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> can be negotiated to a third party.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> that denotes that {{merchandise}} is in {{good condition}} upon being received by the shipping carrier {{is referred to as}} a [...] "clean" [...] <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading,</b> while a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> that denotes that merchandise has incurred damage prior to being received by the shipping carrier would be known as a [...] "foul" [...] or [...] "claused" [...] <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> A claused <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> will have a statement (clause) written onto the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> noting down any damage or other issues. Letters of credit usually will not allow for foul <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading,</b> and the buyer is not obliged to accept any <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> that is not clean.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} where <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> {{can be used as}} carrier's receipt for goods. The first is on board <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading,</b> also known as clean <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> Clean <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> is used when there is no {{discrepancy}} between description filled by shipper and the actual goods shipped on board. Clean <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> indicates that the goods have been properly loaded on board the carrier's ship according to the prima facie evidence. If the carrier finds out that the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> is different from goods on board, one can provide contradictory evidence on clean <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> It is valid as long as in the hand of the carrier, but once it is transferred and negotiated to the third party, it cannot be rebutted and the carrier can no longer mark discrepancy. The second is claused <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> Claused <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> is used when there is some discrepancy between description in the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> and the actual goods. For claused <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading,</b> one can mark only when the goods are loaded.|$|R

40|$|LL. D. The <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> in South African law is {{the theme}} of this study. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> in its {{traditional}} paper form is examined. The aim of the first part of the study is to reconcile the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> that is based on English law with the principles of South African law, especially regarding concepts such as possession and ownership. A plea is made for the application of South African law to <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> rather than English law exclusively. Even though English law undoubtedly forms the basis of the law governing <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading,</b> such law should be applied in a way that is consistent with the general principles of South African law. The functions <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> are considered in detail, particularly the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> as a document of title. A submission is made of five characteristics of a document of title. The conclusion is that the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading,</b> though based on English law concepts, can be integrated into South African law without difficulty. The subsequent examination of the transfer of contractual rights and the imposition of liabilities will show that there is a dire need for new legislation in South Africa to replace an English Act of 1855. The current proposals for such legislation are, however, in need of extensive revision. The fact that the traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> only arrives at the port of destination after the goods, leads to a multitude of problems. The carrier may only deliver the goods in exchange for a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> Letters <b>of</b> indemnity are therefore used to protect the carrier that delivers the goods without receiving a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> Such indemnities will be enforceable in South African law if the carrier has no reason to suspect that the receiver of the goods is not entitled to delivery. The consideration of the nature and functions <b>of</b> the traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading,</b> enables the study to progress to an examination <b>of</b> an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> The use <b>of</b> an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> means that many problems facing the traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> can be avoided. The continuing evolution <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> will be examined against the background of electronic commerce. Writing and signature requirements should not inhibit the development <b>of</b> an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> The difficulty facing the dematerialisation <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> is providing for negotiability in an electronic environment, and ensuring that an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> is the equivalent of an original and unique paper <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> It is possible to create an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> that performs all the functions <b>of</b> a traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading,</b> and there are examples of the use <b>of</b> such electronic <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> in practice. Delivery of the goods can take place by way of attomment rather than the usual symbolical delivery following the transfer <b>of</b> a paper <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> It is submitted that there is currently no need for legislative intervention to provide for electronic <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> in South Africa...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{traditional}} <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> is <b>of</b> {{great value}} in the maritime industry. However, as electronic communication takes over in international trade, the electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> is now being considered first in some situations. A brief introduction <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> will be made together with a general comparison between the traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> and the electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> Further analysis will concentrate {{on the issues of}} how the electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> applies in some particular international e-commerce cases and how we can improve the new electronic data interchange system. Finally, this paper aims to demonstrate that it may be advantageous to ultimately switch entirely from the paper <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> to an electronic one in a modern e-commerce-driven society...|$|R
5000|$|For many years, the {{industry}} has sought {{a solution to the}} difficulties, costs and inefficiencies associated with paper <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> One answer is to make the bill an electronic document. [...] An electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> (or eB/L) is the legal and functional equivalent <b>of</b> a paper <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> An electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> must replicate the core functions <b>of</b> a paper <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading,</b> namely its functions as a receipt, as evidence of or containing the contract of carriage and as a document of title.|$|R
50|$|The {{shipowner}} {{is further}} secured by the stipulation {{that if the}} total freight payable under the <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> {{is less than the}} full chartered freight, the difference is paid to the shipowner before the vessel sails. Sometimes a difficulty arises, notwithstanding these precautions: even though the charter-party gives an ample lien, the terms <b>of</b> the <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> may be insufficient to preserve the same extensive lien as against the holder <b>of</b> the <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> The shippers under the <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading,</b> if they are not the charterers, are not liable for the chartered freight, but only for the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> freight. Unless the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> expressly reserves it, they are not subject to a lien for the chartered freight. The master may guard against this difficulty by refusing to sign <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> that do not preserve the shipowner's lien for full chartered freight. However a difficulty often arises from an improvident clause in the charter-party that requires him to sign <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> as presented. See Kruger v. Moel Tryvan, 1907 A. C. 272.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> from carrier to shipper {{can be used}} as an {{evidence}} of the contract of carriage by the fact that carrier has received the goods and upon the receipt the carrier would deliver the goods. In this case, the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> would be used as a contract of carriage. Also, the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> can perform as a contract of a carriage. In this case, the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> can be used if shipper does not properly ship the goods than the shipper cannot receive the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> from the carrier. Eventually, the shipper would have to deliver the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> to the seller. In this case, the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> is used as a contract of carriage between seller and carrier. However, when the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> is negotiated to a bona fide third party then the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> becomes a conclusive evidence where no contradictory evidence can be introduced. It is because the third party cannot examine the actual shipment and can only pay attention to the document itself, not survey or examination of the shipment itself. However, the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> will rarely be the contract itself, since the cargo space will have been booked previously, perhaps by telephone, email or letter. The preliminary contract will be acknowledged by both the shipper and carrier to incorporate the carrier's standard terms of business. If the Hague-Visby Rules apply, then all of the Rules will be automatically annexed to the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading,</b> thus forming a statutory contract.|$|R

If you are the author please contact PEARL Admin (pearladmin@plymouth. ac. uk) to discuss options. This Thesis will consider the development <b>of</b> the traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> from its origins, which appear to be much older than previously considered, {{up to the present}} day. The development <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> will be examined in order to answer basic questions: what is a traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading,</b> and what functions does it perform. In Part I of the Thesis the development of the three main functions <b>of</b> the traditional <b>bill</b> will be considered, namely receipt, contract, document of title. It will conclude with observations on the nature <b>of</b> the traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> and how it differs from the early form <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> Part II <b>of</b> the Thesis will then consider the development and nature of related shipping documents (charterparty bills, received for shipment bills, non-transferable bills), how far these documents perform the functions <b>of</b> the traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading,</b> and whether they can be truly described as <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> Part II will then go on to consider the development and nature <b>of</b> electronic <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> and assess how well such bills perform the functions <b>of</b> the traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> The Thesis will conclude that although most of the functions <b>of</b> the traditional <b>bill</b> are in effect performed by electronic bills, electronic bills are in fact a new type <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> and not merely a traditional bill in an electronic format. Conclusions will then be drawn as to what effect the development of new types <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> will have on the future <b>of</b> the traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> in the maritime industry...|$|R

40|$|The most {{well known}} and {{developed}} sea transport document is the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading,</b> a legal institution of its own with many advantages, {{but it is also}} known to be a main contributor to high costs of trade due to delayed arrival of original documents, inaccurate or insufficient information and fraudulent issuance of incorrect or forged <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> The trade community’s response to the problems associated with the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> has been to develop the concept <b>of</b> the electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> This work began as early as 1970 but still has not gained commercial momentum. The purpose of this thesis is therefore to investigate whether electronic <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> are legally valid and if such documents can be submitted and accepted as evidence {{in a court of law}} and if there are such legal obstacles, to investigate international and/or national initiatives aimed at resolving the situation. A secondary purpose is to investigate how electronic <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> are used today and how their functionality is perceived by the trade parties. The traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> is a document of title granting right to control of the goods to its holder. It is by Swedish law not clear if an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> qualifies as such a document of title meaning that a buyer of goods that is being transported under an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> may not have the right to control of the goods. Delayed arrival <b>of</b> original <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> cause carriers to deliver goods against letters of indemnity instead <b>of</b> surrender <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading,</b> hereby exposing themselves to risk and loss of P&I cover. Paper <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> are considered secure but are still subject to fraud and forgery. Electronic alternatives are considered equally or more secure, much thanks to the use of electronic signatures. World trade is increasing, in part due to the introduction of ICT systems that minimizes manual intervention and allows for free flow of information between concerned parties. Current offerings <b>of</b> electronic <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> are integrated in such information systems. Existing, such as the American, and proposed, such as the Rotterdam Rules, legislation that promotes the use <b>of</b> electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> applies the principle of equivalence, whereby it is the functionality, not the media, which defines the legal qualities of a transport document. The document of title functionality is achieved by applying the principle of singularity, according to which, only one party may control the transport record, which is the functional equivalence of being the holder <b>of</b> a traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> Such laws do not yet exist in Sweden, leaving it unclear whether holders of electronic transport records have the same right to control of the goods as do holders <b>of</b> traditional paper <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> Key conclusions <b>of</b> the thesis are that legislation based on the functional equivalence principle would eradicate the legal obstacles to the use <b>of</b> electronic <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> and that such legislative action combined with the current trend of implementing ICT systems in the shipping industry would serve to overcome the “traditional inertia” that has characterized the industry for so long, and ease the transition in to modern document management systems that will serve to eradicate the problems caused by the paper <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading...</b>|$|R

40|$|Documentary {{sanctity}} is the norm; {{the backbone}} of the international sale transactions particularly when it involves contract of carriage by sea. Under this norm, the trader is able to rely on the statements in the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> as conclusive since the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> is regarded as an essential part of shipping documents where sea carriage is envisaged.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} problems <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> {{in international}} {{carriage of goods}} by sea. The objectives of the thesis are twofold. The primary objective is the identification of major legal problems associated with <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> The second objective is to evaluate the adequacy <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> legislation in protecting the legitimate rights and interest of the parties. Legal problems confronting <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> legislation are 'title to sue' and 'third party liability' which cause difficulties and obstades to the legal function <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> Another problem in <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> concern marine cargo liability regimes. Under existing international law there is no uniformity in marine cargo liability regimes which results in a conflict of laws. Notwithstanding the entry into force of the United Nations Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea, the Hamburg Rules, in 1992, {{there is evidence that}} the Rules are not accepted by major shipping nations. Moreover, recent developments concerning electronic <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> play a vital part. The thesis seeks to emphasise the problems which exist {{as a result of the}} inconsistencies between law and practice in this area. Attention is also drawn to the use of Electronic Data Interchange (EDT) as electronic <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> together with its legal aspects. The thesis argues that the entry into force of the Hamburg Rules, as a whole, did not provide significant changes in international carriage of goods by sea even though some countries, such as the People's Republic of China, had developed some concepts of the Rules. This argument is based on a number of factors including the principle of marine cargo liability, the current position of major shipping nations, and empirical evidence of the impact of the adoption of the Rules. The conclusion of the thesis is that <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> legislative reform can eliminate major legal problem and sufficient enough to facilitate the use <b>of</b> electronic <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> With regard to Australia, the Australian marine cargo liability regime have been improved to promote better balance of rights and liabilities between parties to a contract of carriage, and it becomes more compatible with those regimes of its trading partners...|$|R

40|$|Arbitration is consensual by nature. Therefore, {{arbitration}} agreement is usually {{binding on the parties}} {{privy to the}} contract containing the arbitration clause. Nevertheless, general principles of contract law allow for extension of an arbitration clause to third parties only if free, knowing and complete consent of such party to arbitrate is established. It is difficult to tailor this rule to the situation when a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> issued under a charterparty contains a reference clause, which brings all terms, conditions and exceptions of the charterparty into the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> The problem arises when it is contended that the charterparty arbitration clause also becomes a part <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> contract, without being repeated verbatim therein. <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> is a commercial instrument that may come into the hands of a party with no knowledge of the arbitration clause in the original charterparty. The practical significance of the problem manifests itself when it must be decided whether the third party transferee <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> is bound to arbitrate or has to pursue the carrier in the ordinary courts of law. The core of the arbitration is consent of a party to arbitrate. Such consent can hardly be established when the holder <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> had no knowledge of an arbitration clause when taking up the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> The aim <b>of</b> the research was to examine under what conditions can a charterparty arbitration clause brought into the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> by reference bind a third party holder <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading.</b> The study compares the position of the English law and that of the Norwegian law on the subject and analyzes to what extent these rules accord with the consensual nature of arbitration. The research concludes that in principle, these two legal systems approach the issue of incorporation differently. While Norwegian law is more concerned with establishing actual or constructive notice of an arbitration clause by the holder, English law takes more formalistic approach and focuses on formulation of the reference and arbitration clauses in question. To preserve a consensual nature of arbitration, the study recommends not to apply the rules of incorporation mechanically. Rather, the individual context and commercial background of each particular case must be analyzed. The ultimate aim is to establish actual or constructive notice of an arbitration clause by the holder when taking up the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading,</b> hence its consent to arbitrate...|$|R
40|$|This {{comparative}} thesis {{addresses the}} evidentiary value <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>lading</b> and estoppel under the Hague and Hague/Visby Rules, {{the law in}} the United Kingdom and the United States. After an analysis of the travaux prepraratoires of the Hague and Hague/Visby Rules, and a comparison with the Hamburg Rules, the thesis focuses on the English common law and the relevant statutory provisions. The thesis advocates a new, alternative approach in order to overcome the current interpretive problems with the application of the common law doctrine of estoppel. The analysed provisions are those of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1971 (U. K.), an enactment of the Hague/Visby Rules, the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1992 (U. K.), the U. S. Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1936, an enactment of the Hague Rules, and the U. S. Federal <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lading</b> Act, 1994.
