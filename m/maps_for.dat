30|$|To {{quantify}} {{the impacts of}} land-use and future climate change on hydrological processes, 5 -year average period (1991 – 1995) was chosen for present climate to predict for future period (2100). We selected this period {{according to the data}} available, and the data generated from RCM 20 is based on present climate (1981 – 2000). Land-use <b>map</b> <b>for</b> 1987 and 2009 was used to represent present and future periods. Altogether six simulations were performed using the calibrated MIKE SHE model: a combination of the land-use <b>map</b> <b>for</b> 1987 with the 5 -year average climate data (1991 – 1995), land-use <b>map</b> <b>for</b> 2009 with the 5 -year average climate data (1991 – 1995), land-use <b>map</b> <b>for</b> 1987 with the 5 -year average climate data (scenario 1) and (scenario 2) and land-use <b>map</b> <b>for</b> 2009 with the 5 -year average climate data (scenario 1) and (scenario 2). Finally, to compare the hydrological effects simulated results were used.|$|R
5|$|A highway roughly {{parallel}} to the modern I-275 was included in early planning <b>maps</b> <b>for</b> the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s. As plans developed through the 1960s and into the early 1970s, the freeway was to run from I-75 near Newport north to Novi and connect back to I-75 near Davisburg. Some plans in the 1970s had the northern Novi–Davisburg section numbered as a state highway M-275. The southern half of I-275 was built in segments that were completed in January 1977. Later that month, the state canceled the northern section because of local opposition. A later attempt to revive the proposal failed in 1979. Additional plans to complete M-275 through Oakland County were kept on the drawing boards through the 1980s, but failed to materialize. M-5 (Haggerty Connector) opened along part of the former I-275/M-275 right-of-way between 1994 and 2000.|$|E
5|$|A new county-designated highway {{appeared}} on <b>maps</b> <b>for</b> {{the first time}} in 1983, H-16; it was marked as running between US2 and M-28 only. This designation was removed in the 1985 edition of the map. The H-16 label reappeared in 1992; this time it was shown continuing south toward the Wisconsin state line and north to M-38, along the routing of FFH-16. The roadway is part of the Forest Highway System that is funded and administered by the US Forest Service and the Federal Highway Administration; the system was created by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921. The highway has never been included in the CDH system as Iron, Houghton and Ontonagon counties do not participate in the system, and the Upper Peninsula east of US41 is the G zone, not the H zone.|$|E
5|$|All trucks of the LRDG were {{equipped}} with the Bagnold sun compass and some trucks were also {{equipped with}} a P8 Tank Compass. Each patrol had a navigator who always rode in the second truck in the formation. He was equipped with a theodolite and astronomical position tables with which to plot star sightings, and maps. Watches were used and adjusted each evening using the GMT time check. One major problem faced early on by the LRDG {{was a lack of}} accurate <b>maps</b> <b>for</b> Libya in particular. Patrols had to do their own surveys and make their own maps of each route they took. In July 1941 the Survey Section was formed to carry out this task.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{had largely}} {{abandoned}} short fiction by the mid-1990s, Gibson returned to writing novels, completing his second trilogy, the Bridge trilogy {{at the close}} of the millennium. After writing two episodes of the television series The X-Files around this time, Gibson was featured as the subject of a documentary film, No <b>Maps</b> <b>for</b> These Territories, in 2000. Gibson has been invited to address the National Academy of Sciences (1993) and the Directors Guild of America (2003) and has had a plethora of articles published in outlets such as Wired, Rolling Stone and The New York Times. His third trilogy of novels, Pattern Recognition (2003), Spook Country (2007) and Zero History (2010) have put Gibson's work onto mainstream bestseller lists for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Descent 3 was {{initially}} released for Microsoft Windows on June 17, 1999. A level editor was released shortly afterwards and {{allows users to}} create both single and multiplayer <b>maps</b> <b>for</b> the game. A Mac OS version of the game was released in November 1999. The Mac OS version was ported by programmer Duane Johnson, who previously worked on the 3dfx versions of the original Descent and Descent II. In the United States, the game only sold 52,294 copies by April 2000. Descent 3 was also ported to Linux platforms by Loki Entertainment Software after {{an agreement with the}} game's publisher. The port, which features a multiplayer mode optimized for 16 players, was released in July 2000. In 2014, the game was made available on the Steam digital distribution service.|$|E
5|$|Gibson's {{work has}} {{influenced}} several popular musicians: references to his fiction {{appear in the}} music of Stuart Hamm, Billy Idol, Warren Zevon, Deltron 3030, Straylight Run (whose name is derived from a sequence in Neuromancer) and Sonic Youth. U2's Zooropa album was heavily influenced by Neuromancer, and the band at one point planned to scroll the text of Neuromancer above them on a concert tour, although this did not end up happening. Members of the band did, however, provide background music for the audiobook version of Neuromancer as well as appearing in No <b>Maps</b> <b>for</b> These Territories, a biographical documentary of Gibson. He returned the favour by writing {{an article about the}} band's Vertigo Tour for Wired in August 2005. The band Zeromancer take their name from Neuromancer.|$|E

5|$|The {{commission}} {{recommended that}} Widerøe update its <b>maps</b> <b>for</b> Brønnøysund, review and improve its landing procedures, improve its internal control procedures {{to ensure that}} pilots follow the airline's flight operation regulations, and introduce the Sterile Cockpit Rule. The commission recommended that the Civil Aviation Administration change the flight paths at Brønnøysund to increase the altitude around Torghatten. Flight 710 was the second of four fatal Widerøe accidents which occurred between 1982 and 1993. In the first accident, Flight 933, a poor cockpit culture had also been discovered, but little was followed up, {{in part because of}} a conspiracy theory which surfaced regarding a collision with a fighter jet. Also in the following two major Widerøe accidents, Flight 893 in 1990 and Flight 744 in 1993, the investigation uncovered operational shortcomings.|$|E
5|$|The team {{began work}} on the {{expansion}} in summer 1998, but the task became complicated by Epic's organizational structure. During the development of Unreal, the team members at Digital Extremes were working in Ontario, Canada, while the members at Epic were based in North Carolina, United States, requiring regular travel to Ontario. To remedy this, Epic decided to centralize the teams in Raleigh, North Carolina, and by September, work on the expansion could begin. Lead programmer Steve Polge set about laying the foundations for the new game types, such as Capture the Flag and Domination, and level designers created {{the first round of}} <b>maps</b> <b>for</b> testing. The content grew quickly, and soon the team realized that it had underestimated the task. In November, after a meeting with publisher GT Interactive, Mark Rein suggested releasing the work as a standalone game instead of an expansion. The team was reticent at first, but soon accepted the idea, and in December the game became known internally as Unreal: Tournament Edition.|$|E

5|$|After the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show, which {{featured}} Mars as the headline act and the Red Hot Chili Peppers as the special guests, tickets for Mars second North American tour experienced high demands. He became the fastest entertainer {{to sell out}} three concerts at the Blaisdell Arena in Hawaii. Since the morning of February 3, 2014, many shows were sold out {{and only a few}} tickets were available on the primary market, the average price of a ticket was around $500 (US) on the secondary market. Ticketmaster also struggled to keep with demand, having to switch from their interactive seating <b>maps</b> <b>for</b> most events. The price for tickets on the primary market ranged from $49 (US) to $100 (US), however in bigger cities the price was between $70 (US) and $181 (US). On the secondary market, tickets for big venues had a wider price range of between $150 (US) to $600 (US). At these prices, Mars tour ranked amongst the most expensive in the U.S. during the summer of 2014, ahead of One Direction and Jason Aldean shows, which had the highest prices for an American tour on the same period. Two months after the Super Bowl, 27 of the 48 dates booked for the second leg on North America were sold out on the primary market. The only tickets left for those shows were available on the secondary market for a lower price than after the game. Nevertheless, the tour {{became one of the most}} expensive of 2014 due to the latter market.|$|E
5|$|Loper {{attended}} the United States Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas from August 1939 to February 1940. On graduation, he was posted to the 7th Engineer Battalion at Fort McClellan, Alabama. He was Assistant Chief of Staff, G-3, and then Assistant Chief of Staff, G-4, of the 5th Infantry Division. In June 1940, he became Assistant Chief of the Intelligence Division at the Office of the Chief of Engineers in Washington, DC, and then chief. Here, {{he was promoted}} to major on 1 July 1940, lieutenant colonel on 18 September 1941, and colonel on 8 June 1942. In May 1942, he negotiated the Loper-Hotline Agreement, under which responsibility for military mapping and survey of the globe was divided between the United States and the United Kingdom. The agreement also specified technical features such as grids, scales and formats, so Allied servicemen everywhere would have common <b>maps.</b> <b>For</b> his services in this post, he was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal on 28 May 1944.|$|E
5|$|The State Trunkline Highway System {{was formed}} on May 13, 1913, and several {{sections}} of the system were designated along {{the course of the}} then-future I-75. Division1 connected the Ohio state line northeasterly to Detroit, and Division2 connected Detroit with Mackinaw City. A branch of Division7 ran north from St. Ignace to Sault Ste. Marie. The system was signposted in 1919, and those highways were marked on <b>maps</b> <b>for</b> the first time. The first M-10 was designated along the highways from Ohio through Detroit to Standish. M-76 connected Standish with Grayling, where the first M-14 ran northward to Cheboygan. From there, M-10 connected to Mackinaw City. In the UP, M-12 connected St. Ignace with Sault Ste. Marie along a route to the east of the old Mackinac Trail. When the United States Numbered Highway System was formed on November 11, 1926, most of these highways were redesignated as part of the national system. From the state line northward, M-10 was included as a part of US24 and US25. At Detroit, M-10 was used as a part of US10. North of Grayling, M-14 was redesignated as a part of US27. M-12 was used for US2.|$|E
