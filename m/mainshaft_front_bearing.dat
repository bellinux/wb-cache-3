40|$|Abstract. This {{study was}} focused on the {{theoretical}} modeling and numerical investigation about the dynamic and static stiffness of coupled double-rotor spindle system of high speed grinder. The moment balance and the transition matrix, the state vector, field matrix of spindle system of high speed grinder were analyzed and deduced. The theoretical models about dynamic and static stiffness were established using the transfer matrix method. The numerical results showed that increased rigidity of <b>front</b> <b>bearing</b> significantly increased static and dynamic rigidity of spindle end and the rigidity of <b>front</b> <b>bearing</b> increased, dynamic rigidity increased more significantly than static rigidity. Furthermore, it can be conclued that increased overhang length reduced dynamic and static rigidity of spindle end at an increasingly slower rate and the span of bearing increased, static and dynamic rigidities of spindle end were reduced...|$|R
