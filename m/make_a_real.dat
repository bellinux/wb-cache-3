5|$|General {{relativity}} {{includes a}} dynamical spacetime, {{so it is}} difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> tensor for this reason.|$|E

The ethics of buying fair trade from a company that is not committed to the cause are questionable; these products are only making a small dent in a big company even though these companies' products account for a significant portion of global fair trade.|$|E

They compare the number of foxes killed in the hunt to the many more killed on the roads. They also argue that wildlife management goals of the hunt can be met more effectively by other methods such as lamping (dazzling a fox with a bright light, then shooting by a competent shooter using an appropriate weapon and load).|$|E

In the event, only the He 111 would <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> impact during the war. Richthofen was following a considerably difficult assignment, stemming from a directive issued to the Reichswehr before Adolf Hitler's rise to power. In July 1932, the Reichswehr had been pursuing the Schnellbomber (fast bomber) concept. The need for modern and fast bombers was to meet the future vision of air warfare for bombers that were faster than fighter aircraft. These concepts became even more important when Hitler seized power and issued demands for rapid rearmament.|$|E

They finally signed Terence Young who had a long background with Broccoli's Warwick Films as the director. Broccoli and Saltzman felt that Young would be able to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> impression of James Bond and transfer the essence of the character from book to film. Young imposed many stylistic choices for the character which continued throughout the film series. Young also decided to inject much humour, as he considered that [...] "a lot of things in this film, the sex and violence and so on, if played straight, a) would be objectionable, and b) we're never gonna go past the censors; but the moment you take the mickey out, put the tongue out in the cheek, it seems to disarm." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1967, Lesser {{was asked}} to help develop and lead the {{research}} department of the newly formed Children's Television Workshop (CTW, later the Sesame Workshop), the organization responsible {{for the production of}} Sesame Street and other educational television programs. [...] He was invited by Carnegie Foundation vice-president and Sesame Street co-creator Lloyd Morrisett, whom he had met while they were both psychology students at Yale. [...] At first, Lesser was skeptical about the new show's potential and its ability to teach children; according to Morrisett, [...] "he took some convincing". [...] As Lesser later reported, he would be involved only if he was able to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> contribution. [...] When he saw that Morrisett and his co-creator, Joan Ganz Cooney, were serious about developing goals and a curriculum for the new show, {{and that it would be}} an [...] "experimental venture in education by television", he became the first chairman of the CTW's advisory board, a position he held from 1967 to 1997. [...] Lesser was skeptical about Cooney's qualifications as CTW's first CEO, although by the time he wrote Children and Television in 1974, she stated in the book's foreword, [...] "...I couldn't begin to measure how proud I am to be Gerry Lesser's colleague and how happy I am to know the pleasure of his company".|$|E
500|$|The Lost Tapes was {{met with}} {{widespread}} acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 81, based on 12 reviews. In Entertainment Weekly, Craig Seymour said Nas' [...] "gritty, yet hopeful, reflections made Lost Tapes a real find." [...] Rolling Stone critic Jon Caramanica hailed it as [...] "the real Stillmatic", writing that it [...] "displayed Nas' gifts for tightly stitched narrative and stunningly precise detail." [...] In The A.V. Club, Nathan Rabin deemed it a masterpiece whose assorted tracks cohered {{as well as any}} of Nas' official studio albums while reaffirming his reputation as [...] "rap music's poet laureate of urban despair". Ken Capobianco from The Boston Globe said the leftover songs proved why Nas had so much promise early in his career, while Spins Chris Ryan viewed the record as a hip hop version of Bob Dylan's much-bootlegged Basement Tapes—"a raw document [...] still proves that Nas had it all along." [...] PopMatters critic Marc L. Hill called it a [...] "masterfully arranged" [...] and [...] "necessary addition to the collection of any hip-hop fan". In The Village Voice, Christgau was particularly impressed by the four autobiographical songs closing the album, preferring them to other songs he felt were nothing more than outtakes. In a less enthusiastic review, Brett Berliner from Stylus Magazine wrote that as good as the songs were, [...] "they don't <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> album ... like a superb mixtape", while Billboards Rashaun Hall believed the production on some of the songs sounded outdated.|$|E

He took this country to war on a series of lies against the best legal advice and in defiance of majority opinion." [...] A spokesman for Blair said that it had long been his intention to give the money to a charity; he added aiding soldiers undergoing rehabilitation at the Battle Back Challenge Centre was [...] "his way of honouring their courage and sacrifice."
