5|$|Tu-142M: A 30-centimetre (12in) {{stretch to}} front fuselage, {{redesigned}} cockpit and two-axle <b>main</b> <b>undercarriage</b> bogies. Built by Taganrog.|$|E
5|$|Tu-142: A {{lengthened}} Tu-95 {{with much}} defensive armament removed, and instead incorporating ASW systems. Twelve aircraft initially had 12-wheel <b>main</b> <b>undercarriage</b> bogies. Six later aircraft had four-wheel bogies. Built by Kuibyshev Aviation Plant.|$|E
5|$|A second I-215 {{was built}} to an order from OKB-1 as the I-215D (dooblyor, second prototype), to {{evaluate}} the bicycle or tandem landing gear configuration. It used wider-diameter paired wheels in a tandem arrangement that retracted into the fuselage, along with small outrigger wheels under the engine nacelles which retracted into fairings. The <b>main</b> <b>undercarriage</b> of the I-215D also incorporated a kneeling feature which could increase the incidence of the aircraft by 3° to assist take-off. Trials with this undercarriage arrangement were successful and {{paved the way for}} its use in other Soviet aircraft, including Dr. Brunolf Baade's Aircraft 150, then under development.|$|E
50|$|Up to 6,000 kg (13,320 lb) {{of bombs}} {{were to be}} carried {{internally}} in the fuselage bomb bay between the nose and <b>main</b> <b>undercarriages.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On 8 June 2013, Wizz Air Flight 3141, an Airbus A320-232 (registration HA-LWM) from Bucharest - Henri Coandă Airport, Romania to Rome-Ciampino, Italy, made an {{emergency}} landing at Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport when the crew encountered problems lowering one of the <b>main</b> <b>undercarriages</b> and locking it into position. The aircraft diverted to Fiumicino because of the longer runway, and firefighters applied foam after landing as a precautionary measure. The aircraft was evacuated using slides. Initial reports of injured passengers were denied by both Wizz Air and Rome Fiumicino Airport, who said some passengers requested medical checkups but reported no injuries.|$|R
5|$|The {{airframe}} is of semi-monocoque structure constructed {{primarily of}} aluminium alloys. High strength steel and titanium alloys are partially adopted in some critical areas. The airframe {{is designed for}} a service life of 4,000 flight hours or 25 years, the first overhaul being due at 1,200 flight hours. Block 2 JF-17s incorporate greater use of composite materials in the airframe to reduce weight. The retractable undercarriage has a tricycle arrangement with a single steerable nose-wheel and two <b>main</b> <b>undercarriages.</b> The hydraulic brakes have an automatic anti-skid system. The position {{and shape of the}} inlets is designed to give the required airflow to the jet engine during manoeuvres involving high angles of attack.|$|R
5|$|The Comet was an {{all-metal}} low-wing cantilever monoplane {{powered by}} four jet engines; {{it had a}} four-place cockpit occupied by two pilots, a flight engineer, and a navigator. The clean, low-drag design of the aircraft featured many design elements that were fairly uncommon at the time, including a swept-wing leading edge, integral wing fuel tanks, and four-wheel bogie <b>main</b> <b>undercarriage</b> units designed by de Havilland. Two pairs of turbojet engines (on the Comet 1s, Halford H.2 Ghosts, subsequently known as de Havilland Ghost 50 Mk1s) were buried into the wings.|$|E
5|$|The square-windowed Comet 1 was {{the first}} model produced, a total of 12 {{aircraft}} in service and test. Following closely the design features of the two prototypes, the only noticeable change was the adoption of four-wheel bogie <b>main</b> <b>undercarriage</b> units, replacing the single main wheels. Four Ghost 50 Mk 1 engines were fitted (later replaced by more powerful Ghost DGT3 series engines). The span was 115ft (35.05m), and overall length 93ft (28.35m); the maximum takeoff weight was over 105,000lb (47.628kg) and over 40 passengers could be carried.|$|E
25|$|Airbus {{adopted a}} new {{philosophy}} for the attachment of the A350s <b>main</b> <b>undercarriage</b> {{as part of}} the switch to a composite wing structure. Each <b>main</b> <b>undercarriage</b> leg is attached to the rear wing spar forward and to a gear beam aft, which itself is attached to the wing and the fuselage. To help reduce the loads further into the wing, a double side-stay configuration has been adopted. This solution resembles the design of the Vickers VC10.|$|E
50|$|Undercarriage: All {{versions}} of the MD-80 are equipped with a tricycle undercarriage, featuring a twin nose unit with spray deflector and twin main units with rock deflectors. The MD-80T, developed for the Chinese, differs in that the main units are each fitted with a four-wheel double <b>main</b> bogey <b>undercarriage</b> to reduce pavement loading.|$|R
50|$|The DH.9, DH.9B, and DH.9C were {{dimensionally}} similar, {{with the}} same wingspan and height and only small variations in length depending on the powerplant. They were two-bay tractor biplanes, with fixed two-wheel <b>main</b> and tail-skid <b>undercarriage.</b> Their structures were of spruce and ash, wire-braced and fabric-covered.|$|R
50|$|The M-105 {{engine was}} fitted {{in a low}} drag {{installation}} with a pressurised coolant system which required a radiator of only 0.17m^2 frontal area (approx ½ that of a similar unpressurised coolant system), hydraulically retractable <b>main</b> and tail <b>undercarriages</b> with fully closing doors also reduced drag.|$|R
25|$|On 2 October 2009, Malaysia Airlines Boeing 737-4H6 9M-MMR was {{substantially}} damaged {{when the}} port <b>main</b> <b>undercarriage</b> collapsed while the aircraft was {{parked at the}} gate.|$|E
25|$|Its <b>main</b> <b>undercarriage</b> had a wide track, {{with twin}} wheels on short axles mounted below each engine on {{inverted}} V struts, themselves further braced {{to the lower}} fuselage longerons.|$|E
25|$|One further {{development}} was the Spartan Cruiser III, with an aerodynamically-refined fuselage accommodating eight passengers, a modified windscreen and a trousered <b>main</b> <b>undercarriage.</b> Only three Cruiser IIIs were built (G-ACYK, G-ADEL and G-ADEM), for Spartan Air Lines.|$|E
2500|$|The DH.9, DH.9B, and DH.9C were {{dimensionally}} similar, {{with the}} same wingspan and height and only small variations in length depending on the powerplant.

50|$|FedEx Flight 630 was {{a regular}} {{scheduled}} cargo flight from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to Memphis International Airport, Memphis, Tennessee. On July 28, 2006, the McDonnell Douglas MD-10-10Foperating the flight, crashed upon landing due to a landing gear failure. The <b>main</b> left <b>undercarriage</b> collapsed 7 seconds after touchdown causing the MD-10 to roll off the runway out of control. The aircraft finally {{came to a stop}} near taxiway M4 and caught fire. The fire consumed the wing and port engine and the crash and evacuation left the 2 crew-members and the sole passenger, an off-duty crew-member, injured.|$|R

25|$|The <b>main</b> <b>undercarriage</b> had one fixed wheel on each side, {{mounted on}} three diagonally-braced struts, {{one to the}} upper and two to the lower edge of the fuselage; there was a single tailwheel. Ailerons were fitted to both upper and lower wings.|$|E
25|$|The Paalson Type 1, (Pålson), was a Swedish single-seat sport {{aircraft}} {{built around}} 1920. It was of conventional single-seat biplane layout but had some unusual {{features such as}} girder type interplane struts, a novel <b>main</b> <b>undercarriage</b> axle mounting and a mechanism allowing adjustment of the angle of incidence of the upper wing.|$|E
25|$|On 14 June 2001, the {{starboard}} <b>main</b> <b>undercarriage</b> of a Dash 8-100 aircraft collapsed on landing at Båtsfjord Airport after {{a flight from}} Alta Airport, resulting in substantial damage to the aircraft.

2500|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Jantar 2 has {{a central}} steel tube section, enclosed within a glass fibre epoxy shell which narrows aft of the wings. [...] Its cockpit {{is long and}} roomy, with a two piece canopy, the rear section of which hinges upwards from behind. [...] The tall, straight tapered and blunt tipped fin {{is an integral part}} of the fuselage structure; the straight edged rudder extends down to the keel and operates in a small cut-out in the elevators. [...] The Jantar's straight tapered tailplane is mounted on the fin just above the upper fuselage line. [...] Its <b>main</b> monowheel <b>undercarriage</b> is retractable, as is the tailwheel.|$|R
50|$|Patterned {{after the}} {{successful}} de Havilland Mosquito, the Calquín had a wooden structure {{similar to the}} FMA AeMB.2, {{and was the first}} twin-engined aircraft designed and built in Argentina. The I.Ae.24 design was based on a cantilever mid-mounted wooden (indigenous woods were used throughout) wings with fabric-covered flying surfaces. The conventional <b>main</b> twin-oleo <b>undercarriage</b> retracted into the engine nacelles while the tailwheel retracted into the aft fuselage. The two-man crew were seated side-by-side under a large transparency constructed partly of acrylic glass with glass panels. The armament consisted of four 12.7 mm machine guns grouped in the nose. Some examples later had four 20 mm cannons and an internal bombload of 1,764 lb (800 kg) kg along with 12 rockets (75 mm) mounted under the wings.|$|R

25|$|The {{airframe}} {{was constructed}} largely of wood, with plywood covering the forward fuselage and a steel-tube v-strut chassis <b>main</b> <b>undercarriage</b> with two wheels and a tail-skid at the aft {{end of the}} fuselage. Two examples of the R.II had been completed {{by the time the}} Armistice bore the IdFlieg German military registration numbers R.55/17 and R.58/17.|$|E
25|$|Construction was {{primarily}} wooden, with plywood-skinned spruce frames. The cantilever oleo-pneumatic fixed <b>main</b> <b>undercarriage</b> legs were faired with spats. The undercarriage, tail unit and outer wing panels were {{adapted from the}} Parnall Heck 2C. The propeller was a de Havilland fixed-pitch type. Student and tutor sat in open, tandem cockpits, but the rear cockpit was later enclosed.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of the AIR-9 followed Yavovlev's previous designs with wooden plywood and fabric covered wings, welded steel tube fabric-covered fuselage and Duralumin fabric covered tail surfaces. The fixed spatted <b>main</b> <b>undercarriage</b> was supported by struts, later fitted with trousers as well as spats, with a fixed tail-skid or tailwheel (as exhibited at the 1935 Milan airshow).|$|E
50|$|Construction was all-wood with plywood {{skinning}} for loaded {{areas and}} fabric covering for lightly loaded {{areas such as}} control surfaces and the wings aft of the <b>main</b> spars. The <b>undercarriage</b> consisted of a semi-recessed mainwheel and small skids under the nose and tail. The cockpit, covered by a built-up plexi-glas canopy was directly forward of the wing leading edge. Control surfaces were of standard wood and fabric construction with the ailerons fitted with external mass balances.|$|R
50|$|Apart from greater power, various {{refinements}} {{were made}} to the design, including modifications to the <b>main</b> nacelle and <b>undercarriage,</b> and completely new wings. The first prototype flew in late 1917 and the type remained in production until 1921. Some 659 of all versions were built by Caproni, and another three were licence-built in the US (two Ca.44s by Standard, and one Ca.46 by Fisher). Planned licensed production in France was cancelled {{with the end of the}} war.|$|R
50|$|The first {{prototype}} 1MF10, {{with the}} Navy designation Experimental 7-shi Carrier Fighter made its maiden flight in March 1933. It {{was destroyed in}} July 1933 when its tail broke up during diving tests, although the pilot escaped by parachute. The second prototype had a revised <b>undercarriage,</b> with the <b>main</b> wheels and <b>undercarriage</b> legs faired into streamlined spats. It was also destroyed in a crash, when {{it could not be}} recovered from a flat spin in June 1934.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was powered by two Piaggio P.XI air-cooled radial engines. They {{were of the}} same type as used in other projects such as the Re.2000, and drove two three-blade, continuous-speed 3.2m (10.4ft) diameter Breda propellers. The engine nacelles also carried the two <b>main</b> <b>undercarriage</b> units. The aircraft had a twin tail to provide the dorsal 7.7mm (0.303in) Breda-SAFAT machine gun with a better field of fire.|$|E
25|$|The G.4/31 {{was a large}} angular biplane with fixed spatted wheel spats {{powered by}} a 690hp (515kW) Bristol Pegasus IM3 with a Townend ring. There was a single forward-firing machine gun for the pilot and a Scarff ring mounted Lewis gun for the observer. Underwing bomb racks on the lower wings and {{provision}} to carry a torpedo between the <b>main</b> <b>undercarriage</b> units was also envisioned.|$|E
25|$|The {{front wing}} was {{moderately}} tapered {{with a straight}} leading edge, while the rear wing was in three parts: an unswept centre section, clearing the propeller and supporting the <b>main</b> <b>undercarriage</b> legs, and outer sections from about ¼ span swept back at approximately 30°, supporting large end-plate fins at the tips. The box-like fuselage connected all the components and carried the engine, fuel and cockpit {{as well as the}} nose undercarriage.|$|E
25|$|On 23 August 2008, AIRES Flight 051 {{sustained}} substantial damage {{following the}} collapse of the right hand main landing gear on landing at Barranquilla-Ernesto Cortissoz Airport (BAQ), Colombia. None of the 31 occupants were injured. The Bombardier Dash 8-301, registered HK-3952, operated on an international flight from Curaçao-Hato International Airport (CUR). The approach and landing were normal, touching down about 770 metres past the threshold of runway 23. The crew noticed a vibration of the right hand <b>main</b> gear. The <b>undercarriage</b> leg collapsed. There was no fire.|$|R
50|$|The M-105 {{engine was}} fitted {{in a low}} drag {{installation}} with a pressurised coolant system which required a radiator of only 0.17m^2 frontal area, (approx ½ that of a similar unpressurised coolant system). In the flush cockpit, the pilot sat on a hydraulically actuated seat which raised the hinged roof of the canopy to form a wind-shield for landing, allowing the fuselage to have a total frontal area of only 0.85 m^2. Hydraulically retractable <b>main</b> and tail <b>undercarriages</b> with fully closing doors reduced drag even further.|$|R
