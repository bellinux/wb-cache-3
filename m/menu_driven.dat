2500|$|Hyper-V Server 2008 was {{released}} on October 1, 2008. It consists of Windows Server 2008 Server Core and Hyper-V role; other Windows Server 2008 roles are disabled, and there are limited Windows services. Hyper-V Server 2008 {{is limited to a}} command-line interface used to configure the host OS, physical hardware, and software. A <b>menu</b> <b>driven</b> CLI interface and some freely downloadable script files simplify configuration. In addition, Hyper-V Server supports remote access via Remote Desktop Connection. However, administration and configuration of the host OS and the guest virtual machines is generally done over the network, using either Microsoft Management Consoles on another Windows computer or System Center Virtual Machine Manager. This allows much easier [...] "point and click" [...] configuration, and monitoring of the Hyper-V Server.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Smart Restaurant is {{concept to}} realize the {{automation}} in restaurants or hotels. In this restaurant the kitchen people can get orders from each table through voice alert. This project consists of two sections one is transmitter section and other is receiver section. In our project we have designed an electronic system to order through RF based wireless communication using a menu card provided on each table. Touch panel is used here, which offers simple and multiple <b>menus</b> <b>driven</b> control panel. Mainly touch screen technology is used where control or settings of different parameters in wide manner. We can select the items shown in its display along with its price and can order the selected items through touch panel. The {{total cost of the}} items is also displayed. This order details are collected by wireless receiver placed in the kitchen and will display the items in its display along with the voice announcement through speaker. Each table has its own unique digital code. So the kitchen people can supply those items to that table after preparing it. This will give advantage to avoid the time delay usually experienced during bearer coming, collecting order and finally passes to the kitchen manually...|$|R
40|$|Export {{firms are}} often assumed to {{stabilize}} destination market {{prices in the}} face of nominal exchange rate changes in order to protect market share. We show that standard tests of such pricing to market fail to discriminate against the alternative hypothesis of menu costs. As a case study, we examine the characteristics and determinants of changes in the cover prices of The Economist magazine in a sample of twelve countries over the floating rate period. We find that, while the law of one price fails, {{there is no evidence of}} systematic attempts to offset nominal exchange rate movements. Instead, the findings are consistent with <b>menu</b> cost <b>driven</b> pricing behavior. ...|$|R

40|$|A generic {{expert system}} is {{described}} for inspecting materials processed in space (MPS). The {{system may be}} applied, with the appropriate knowledge base, {{to any of the}} nondestructive testing methods (NDT) which are appropriate to MPS. Regardless of the method being used, the inspection process consists of three tasks: (1) signal or image processing of the NDT output and feature extraction, (2) interpretation of features in terms of MPS discontinuities, and (3) evaluation {{of the quality of the}} MPS based upon industry standards. In contrast to rule based systems, this system represents its knowledge as multidimensional vectors and appropriate functions on them. Currently, the expert system accepts manual input of observed features. Once the expert system has been tested and compared to human expert inspectors, a vision front-end will be developed to complete automation of the expert MPS inspection system, based on visual discontuities. Then the data base will be extended to include a variety of other NDT methods. In addition to functional performance, ease of use was established through <b>menu</b> window <b>driven</b> input as well as flexibility in building, using and modifying data bases for different applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{usefulness}} of models of plant utility systems largely {{depends on the}} capabilities of the process system simulator which uses them. SACDA has been engaged in a multi-year development of a versatile and powerful steady-state simulator which has been satisfactorily applied to both on-line and off-line applications for plant utility and other process systems. Designated as MASSBAL MK II, the simulator has a unique architecture, <b>menu</b> and/or graphic <b>driven</b> user-friendly inputs and outputs, and checking facilities. It also provides for data reconciliation and an advanced optimizer. The program is already widely used for design, and more recently for on-line advanced control of a large plant utility system. It is suitable for testing DCS and expert systems as well as being integrated into those systems as their "calculation engine"...|$|R
40|$|This talk {{will discuss}} the use of Stata version 8 for teaching, {{in the context of}} working with large survey data sets. The range of {{estimation}} techniques discussed will include binary response models, discrete choice models, censored dependent variables and sample selection - all in applied economic contexts. In particular, I will describe some of the problems, as well as the benefits, I've encountered with using Stata {{in the context of the}} above frameworks. For instance, the issue of whether having a "windows <b>driven</b> <b>menu</b> system" detracts from one of the key benefits of Stata for learning - that is having a structured approach to modeling via do files; and also issues of Stata's speed in terms of gaining marginal effects in discrete choice models in comparison to other available econometric software. ...|$|R
40|$|The NPLOT (NASTRAN Plot) is an {{interactive}} computer graphics program for plotting undeformed and deformed NASTRAN finite element models. Developed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, the program provides flexible element selection and grid point, ASET and SPC degree of freedom labelling. It is {{easy to use and}} provides a combination <b>menu</b> and command <b>driven</b> user interface. NPLOT also provides very fast hidden line and haloed line algorithms. The hidden line algorithm in NPLOT proved to be both very accurate and several times faster than other existing hidden line algorithms. A fast spatial bucket sort and horizon edge computation are used to achieve this high level of performance. The hidden line and the haloed line algorithms are the primary features that make NPLOT different from other plotting programs...|$|R

5000|$|In late 2003, Andreas {{released}} AveDesk 1.0 on the Aqua-Soft online community. Soon after, {{a number}} of desklets intended just for AveDesk appeared. Some of the more notable desklets that helped propel AveDesk's popularity was a simple but skinnable shortcut desklet (the predecessor to the [...] "PidlShortcut" [...] desklet), {{that can be easily}} customised to take on {{the look and feel of}} Mac OS X desktop shortcuts but complete with functioning Windows context <b>menus,</b> a disk <b>drive</b> desklet (similar to the shortcut desklet) that could be set to appear only when that particular disk drive has been mounted, and a Trash can desklet that has the additional functions of ejecting a CD or DVD disk drive when its icon has been dragged onto it. These desklets helped to increase the appeal of AveDesk to skinning enthusiasts who wanted to emulate the look and feel of Mac OS X.|$|R
50|$|Unable to cook, Zinos finds Shayn and hires him as Soul Kitchen's new cook. Shayn {{insists on}} {{changing}} the menu {{to a new}} haute cuisine <b>menu.</b> This <b>drives</b> away the old clientele and shrinks business to nearly nothing. Illias has {{the idea of being}} a DJ at Soul Kitchen, which he achieves with equipment stolen {{with the help of his}} criminal friends. Shayn begins to teach Zinos gourmet cooking skills. Gradually, the restaurant's reputation and fortunes turn around, to the point where Zinos can make a tax payment to the authorities. Although Zinos inadvertently, whilst drunk, revealed to Lucia that Illias has a criminal record, with time and his success as a DJ at Soul Kitchen, Lucia changes her opinion of Illias and begins to find herself attracted to him. Meanwhile, Neumann has designs on purchasing the restaurant property and re-developing the site. He offers to buy Soul Kitchen from Zinos, but Zinos continually refuses. One evening, Shayn spikes one dessert with an aphrosidiac from tree bark. This has an effect on everyone in the restaurant, including Neumann and Frau Schuster, the lead tax inspector, where the two of them have sex. Afterwards, after Zinos complimented Neumann on this liaison, Neumann says that he's done the same thing financially to the tax authorities. However, on her way out of the restaurant, Zinos chats with Frau Schuster, and Zinos reveals Neumann's full name to her.|$|R
500|$|By 2001, Burger King's chain-wide {{sales were}} lagging. [...] Corporate {{indifference}} from parent Diageo coupled with lagging sales at larger franchises caused by declining consumer demand for its products led {{the company to}} initiate a menu redesign to try to lure customers back into stores. The company decided to introduce a series of new product launches in a planned menu revamp. Along with a new Whopper-based burger designed to compete with McDonald's Quarter Pounder, a new breakfast sandwich designed {{to compete with the}} McMuffin sandwich, and other new products, Burger King introduced a reformulated Big King replacement called the King Supreme. The new sandwich's ingredients were basically the same as the Big King, but the King Sauce used in the sandwich was reformulated to, according to company claims, enhance the savory nature of the grilled burger patties Burger King uses in its sandwiches. This knock-off <b>driven</b> <b>menu</b> reorganization was designed to better compete with a similar menu expansion at McDonald's, called the New Tastes Menu, introduced earlier the same year.|$|R

The Control Program communicated with separate [...] "Services" [...] like the Mail Server, Calendar Server, File Server (for documents). There was also a Word Processor and a data management program which was also accessible from the Control Program. In 1985, DataGeneral announced a complementary product, TEO (Technical Electronic Office), focused on the office automation needs of engineering professionals.|$|E
40|$|In a work environment, it is {{important}} to identify and quantify the relationship among work activities, working posture, and workplace design. Working posture may impact the physical comfort and well-being of individuals, as well as performance. The Posture Video Analysis Tool (PVAT) is an interactive <b>menu</b> and button <b>driven</b> software prototype written in Supercard (trademark). Human Factors analysts are provided with a predefined set of options typically associated with postural assessments and human performance issues. Once options have been selected, the program is used to evaluate working posture and dynamic tasks from video footage. PVAT has been used to evaluate postures from Orbiter missions, as well as from experimental testing of prototype glove box designs. PVAT can be used for video analysis in a number of industries, with little or no modification. It can contribute to various aspects of workplace design such as training, task allocations, procedural analyses, and hardware usability evaluations. The major advantage of the video analysis approach is the ability to gather data, non-intrusively, in restricted-access environments, such as emergency and operation rooms, contaminated areas, and control rooms. Video analysis also provides the opportunity to conduct preliminary evaluations of existing work areas...|$|R
40|$|When {{acquiring}} simple three-dimensional (3 d) trajectory data it {{is common}} to accumulate large coordinate data sets. In order to examine integrity and consistency of object tracking, it is often necessary to rapidly visualise these data. Ordinarily, to achieve this the user must either execute 3 d plotting functions in a numerical computing environment or manually inspect data in two dimensions, plotting each individual axis. Superplot 3 d is an open source MATLAB script which takes tab delineated Cartesian data points in the form x, y, z and time and generates an instant visualization of the object’s trajectory in free-rotational three dimensions. Whole trajectories may be instantly presented, allowing for rapid inspection. Executable from the MATLAB command line (or deployable as a compiled standalone application) superplot 3 d also provides simple GUI controls to obtain rudimentary trajectory information, allow specific visualization of trajectory sections and perform elementary processing. Superplot 3 d thus provides a framework for non-programmers and programmers alike, to recreate recently acquired 3 d object trajectories in rotatable 3 d space. It is intended, via the use of a preference <b>driven</b> <b>menu</b> to be flexible and work with output from multiple tracking software systems. Source code and accompanying GUIDE. fig files are provided for deployment and further development...|$|R
40|$|Mediman is a {{new image}} {{analysis}} package which has been developed to analyze quantitatively Positron Emission Tomography (PET) data. It is object-oriented, written in C++ and its user interface is based on InterViews on top of which new classes have been added. Mediman accesses data using external data representation or import/export mechanism which avoids data duplication. Multimodality studies are organized in a simple database which includes images, headers, color tables, lists and objects of interest (OOI's) and history files. Stored color table parameters allow to focus directly on the interesting portion of the dynamic range. Lists allow to organize the study according to modality, acquisition protocol, time and spatial properties. OOI's (points, lines and regions) are stored in absolute 3 -D coordinates allowing correlation with other co-registered imaging modalities such as MRI or SPECT. OOI's have visualization properties and are organized into groups. Quantitative ROI analysis of anatomic images consists of position, distance, volume calculation on selected OOI's. An image calculator is connected to mediman. Quantitation of metabolic images is performed via profiles, sectorization, time activity curves and kinetic modelling. Mediman is <b>menu</b> and mouse <b>driven,</b> macro-commands can be registered and replayed. Its interface is customizable through a configuration file. The benefit of the object-oriented approach are discussed from a development point of view...|$|R
