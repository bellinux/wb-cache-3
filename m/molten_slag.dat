500|$|To {{strike the}} {{electric}} arc, the electrode {{is brought into}} contact with the workpiece by a very light touch with the electrode to the base metal then is pulled back slightly. This initiates the arc and thus the melting of the workpiece and the consumable electrode, and causes droplets of the electrode to be passed from the electrode to the weld pool. Striking an arc, which varies widely based upon electrode and workpiece composition, can be the hardest skill for beginners. The orientation of the electrode to workpiece is where most stumble, if the electrode is held at a perpendicular angle to the workpiece the tip will likely stick to the metal which will fuse the electrode to the workpiece which will cause it to heat up very rapidly. The tip of the electrode needs to be at a lower angle to the workpiece, which allows the weld pool to flow out of the arc. [...] As the electrode melts, the flux covering disintegrates, giving off shielding gases that protect the weld area from oxygen and other atmospheric gases. In addition, the flux provides <b>molten</b> <b>slag</b> which covers the filler metal as it travels from the electrode to the weld pool. Once part of the weld pool, the slag floats to the surface and protects the weld from contamination as it solidifies. Once hardened, it must be chipped away to reveal the finished weld. As welding progresses and the electrode melts, the welder must periodically stop welding to remove the remaining electrode stub and insert a new electrode into the electrode holder. This activity, combined with chipping away the slag, reduces {{the amount of time that}} the welder can spend laying the weld, making SMAW one of the least efficient welding processes. In general, the operator factor, or the percentage of operator's time spent laying weld, is approximately 25%.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWith the {{depletion}} of fossil fuel, the exploitation and utilization of biomass have attracted attention widely. Unfortunately, high concentrations of alkali metals, especially K, in biomass result in serious slagging. Therefore, considering the co-existence of unnoticed and inevitable <b>molten</b> <b>slagging</b> {{as well as the}} highlighted alkali-induced slagging, the synthetic effects of kaolin and soil on both slagging are conducted by means of chemical fractionation and ash fusion testing. Addition of kaolin and soil into biomass can convert soluble-K into insoluble-K effectively, and thus reduce alkali-induced slagging. Moreover, soil, attributed to low-cost and wide range of sources, can be slagging inhibitor instead of kaolin. In addition, K 2 O-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 ternary diagrams constructed by addition of K 2 O, SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 into biomass underestimate IDT and over-estimate FT, and they should be constructed according to the biomass ash properties, rather than the simulated ash by adding various compounds into biomass...|$|R
