50|$|In {{all cases}} of {{auditory}} fatigue, sufficient recovery time should allow full correction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearing</b> impairment and return threshold levels to their baseline values. There is currently {{no way to}} estimate <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> time needed to recover from auditory fatigue {{because it is not}} usually detectable until after the injury has already occurred. Studies that measured recovery time have noted that the time required is related to <b>the</b> magnitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initial <b>hearing</b> loss. <b>The</b> most significant recovery was found to occur during the first 15 <b>minutes</b> following cessation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> noise exposure. When sufficient recovery time is not allotted, the effects become permanent, resulting in acquired noise-induced hearing loss. Up to 120 <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> recovery time can be required of noises of only 95 dB. For comparison, common items that can produce noise at this level are motorcycles and subways.|$|R
