25|$|There {{really are}} two {{different}} kinds of DDD: Inside and Outside Abraded Die Doubling. This is because Die Deterioration Doubling manifests itself in two different ways. The two classes look different, and are caused by wear in two different places. Inside Abraded Die Doubling is caused by wear around the edges and inside the actual detail affected. It appears as an enlarged, irregular outline of the element overlapping the original design element. Outside Abraded Die Doubling is caused by actual wear {{in the field of}} the die. The field of a die is the highest point, so when a mint technician polishes the die or the <b>metal</b> <b>flow</b> of a coin wears it away, the field is the first thing to be worn down. The difference here is that Outside doubling does not overlap any of the original design, but rather appears like an irregular shelf around the object.|$|E
500|$|Since 1986, Weinman's obverse {{design has}} been used as the obverse design for the American Silver Eagle bullion coin. [...] In {{adapting}} the design, Mint Sculptor-Engraver John Mercanti {{and other members of the}} engraving staff strengthened many of the details. [...] Mercanti noted that Weinman's original plaster was only [...] in diameter, and was softly modelled. [...] Mercanti increased the detail so that the design, struck on a larger coin, would be bolder and would have a more even <b>metal</b> <b>flow</b> when struck than Weinman's original coin. [...] Treasury Secretary James Baker chose a heraldic eagle design, by Mercanti, as the reverse of the American Silver Eagle.|$|E

It was found that the resulting form of the equations is the one commonly used in commercial CFD codes for the simulation of liquid flows, which can then be used for our applications. The most common numerical methods for flow-Mach number applications were also presented. These methods are general and can be applied to liquid <b>metal</b> <b>flows</b> without any modification.

500|$|Mint Chief Engraver Frank Gasparro made {{minor changes}} {{to all three}} reverse designs. [...] Gasparro {{simplified}} the quarter design, altered the drum {{for the sake of}} authenticity, changed the lettering and modified the expression on the drummer's face. [...] He made slight changes to Independence Hall on the half dollar and altered the lettering on the dollar to facilitate the <b>metal</b> <b>flow</b> during stamping and asked the designer to straighten the bottom edge of the Liberty Bell. [...] Ahr later stated that he would have liked more time to finalize his design, wishing to clarify the features of the drummer's face.

500|$|The King sat for de Saulles twice, in February and June 1901, and the {{engraver}} {{also used}} {{a drawing of}} Edward by court painter Emil Fuchs. The unadorned bust of the King that resulted is in low relief, as de Saulles sought a coin that would be easy for the Royal Mint to strike. Even so, the relatively large size of the head caused <b>metal</b> <b>flow</b> problems for the penny once issued, resulting in [...] "ghosting", a faint outline of the obverse design visible on the reverse. On 20 August 1901, the Mint received confirmation that the de Saulles bust of Edward would be used on all coins. The new bronze coins were made current by a proclamation dated 10 December 1901, effective 1 January 1902.|$|E
500|$|The Mint {{prepared}} pattern coins with a {{much smaller}} eagle in 1858, which struck well, but which officials disliked. Snowden directed Longacre to prepare various patterns that he could select from for a new piece to replace the Flying Eagle cent as of January 1, 1859. The Mint produced between 60 and 100 sets of twelve patterns showing various designs; these were circulated to officials and also were quietly sold by the Mint {{over the next several}} years. Longacre's design showing Liberty wearing an Indian-style headress was adopted, with a wreath with lower relief for the reverse of the Indian Head cent, solving the <b>metal</b> <b>flow</b> issues. On November 4, 1858, Snowden wrote to the Treasury Department, stating that the Flying Eagle cent had proved [...] "not very acceptable to the general population" [...] as they felt the bird was not true to life, and that the Native American design would [...] "giv it the character of America".|$|E

Magnetic fields are frequently used to pump, stir and stabilize liquid <b>metal</b> <b>flows</b> non-intrusively.

500|$|Nevertheless, the Type 2 gold dollar (as {{it came to}} be known) proved {{unsatisfactory}} as the mints {{had difficulty}} in striking the new coin so that all details were brought out. [...] This was due to the high relief of the design—the three Southern branch mints especially had trouble with the piece. Many of the Type 2 pieces quickly became illegible, and were sent back to Philadelphia for melting and recoinage. On most surviving specimens, the [...] "85" [...] in the date is not fully detailed. The Type 2 gold dollar was struck only at Philadelphia in 1854 and 1855, at the three Southern branch mints in the latter year, and at San Francisco in 1856, after the design was designated for replacement. To correct the problems, Longacre enlarged the head of Liberty, making it a scaled-down version of the three-dollar piece, and moved the lettering on the obverse closer to the rim. [...] This improved the <b>metal</b> <b>flow</b> and design sharpness so much that early numismatic scholars assumed the reverse was also altered, though in fact no change was made and the Type 2 and Type 3 reverses are identical.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} it is shown the development, {{implementation}} and numerical solution of several {{computational fluid dynamics}} models {{for the study of}} liquid <b>metal</b> <b>flows.</b> The work is organized in two main parts in which different modeling techniques are analyzed. These two parts are introduced by a brief chapter on the finite element methods and on the computational platform developed during the Ph. D. studies which have been the basis for the implementation and numerical solution of all the developed mathematical models. In the first part, turbulence modeling based on Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes equations is considered for the study of turbulent heat transfer in liquid <b>metal</b> <b>flows.</b> A new four parameter turbulence model is introduced and validated in two different k-e and k-w formulations. Several results in four geometries interesting for the fast nuclear reactor field are reported in order to assess and prove the feasibility of this model for the study of turbulent heat transfer in liquid <b>metal</b> <b>flows.</b> In the second part the adjoint optimal control theory is introduced. Some numerical cases are presented by solving the optimality system with state and adjoint variables. The first application is a temperature boundary optimal control in which an improved way of setting boundary conditions in weak form has been developed. The second application is a distributed optimal control problem for the RANS system.

40|$|International audienceDue to the non-transparency {{of metals}} {{it is nearly}} {{impossible}} to observe how inclusions behave within a liquid metal. At the same time numerical models, which generally are powerful tools for design of different types of metallurgical and other equipment associated with liquid metal, usually contain a high number of degrees of freedom due to the complexity of turbulent flows. Therefore, experimental verification of the numerical models is an essential task, which was hitherto not satisfactorily solved by established technologies. This contribution presents a recent and break-through experimental method, which makes liquid metal transparent: dynamic neutron radiography. It allows to visualize dynamics of solid inclusions in liquid <b>metal</b> <b>flows</b> within a scaled-down equipment, keeping fixed non-dimensional hydrodynamic and electromagnetic parameters and applying a permanent magnets technology for electromagnetic agitation in the sep-up. Such method allows to step forward in understanding two-phase liquid <b>metal</b> <b>flows</b> as well as ensure innovative experiments for improvements in metallurgical equipment, bubbly liquid metal columns, preparation of metal matrix nanocomposites and others...|$|R
