50|$|<b>Microfinancing</b> {{produces}} {{many benefits}} for poverty stricken, or low- income households. One {{of the benefits}} {{is that it is}} very accessible. Banks today simply won’t extend loans to those with little to no assets, and generally don’t engage in small size loans typically associated with <b>microfinancing.</b> Through <b>microfinancing</b> small loans are produced and accessible. <b>Microfinancing</b> is based on the philosophy that even small amounts of credit can help end the cycle of poverty. Another benefit produced from the <b>microfinancing</b> initiative is that it presents opportunities, such as extending education and jobs. Families receiving <b>microfinancing</b> are less likely to pull their children out of school for economic reasons. As well, in relation to employment, {{people are more likely to}} open small businesses that will aid the creation of new jobs.

40|$|<b>Microfinance</b> {{has emerged}} as an {{important}} instrument to alleviate poverty in many countries including in developing countries. Despite being able to demonstrate successes in the activity, conventional <b>microfinance</b> is not without controversy. The findings from the existing studies revealed that conventional <b>microfinance</b> is less effective, fail to reach the poorest people and generally have a limited effect on income. In addition, conventional <b>microfinance</b> also has highly criticized for charging excessive interest rates and fees to the poor entrepreneur. In some Muslim countries, conventional <b>microfinance</b> has always been rejected, due to its non-compliance with the Islamic principles, particularly on the issue related to interest or riba. Islamic <b>microfinance</b> evolved and reckoned {{as an alternative to}} its counterpart. However, the outreach of Islamic <b>microfinance</b> is very limited where only there is very few Islamic <b>microfinance</b> institutions and Islamic banks involved in <b>microfinance</b> activity. Also, Islamic <b>microfinance</b> is having an issue of convergence of activity with the conventional practices. Thus, this paper aims to propose to adopt Zero Interest Financing Model (ZIFM) for Islamic <b>microfinance</b> institutions.
