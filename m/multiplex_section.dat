In “Preliminaries” section, we introduce the Strahler numbers and the h-index in a generalized flow framework, and how those two notions belong to one greater notion of flow. We introduce our ascending flow in “Ascending flow in citation networks” section — modeled on the notion of flow of knowledge. We then discuss the parameters of this ascending flow and put it in relation with classical measures, while proposing a dynamic algorithm that allows for quick update. Finally, in “Experimental results” section we run experiments on a publicly available dataset, the arXiv HEP-Th (Gehrke et al. 2003). We then extend our ascending flow to the multiplex networks context from “The citation network as a <b>multiplex</b> network” <b>section,</b> which fits in our generalized flow framework. After defining our multiplex network in “Preliminaries” section, we propose three multiplex flow measures in “Multiplex extensions of the ascending flow” section, namely the aggregated, sum, and selective flows, with implementation in “Dynamic implementation” section.

50|$|Transport networks, the {{underlying}} optical fiber-based layer of telecommunications networks, have evolved from Digital cross connect system (DCS)-based mesh architectures in the 1980s, to SONET/SDH (Synchronous Optical Networking/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy) ring architectures in the 1990s. In DCS-based mesh architectures, telecommunications carriers deployed restoration systems for DS3 circuits such as at&t FASTAR (FAST Automatic Restoration) and MCI Real Time Restoration (RTR), restoring circuits in minutes after a network failure. In SONET/SDH rings, carriers implemented ring protection such as SONET Unidirectional Path Switched Ring (UPSR) (also called Sub-Network Connection Protection (SCNP) in SDH networks) or SONET Bidirectional Line Switched Ring (BLSR) (also called <b>Multiplex</b> <b>Section</b> - Shared Protection Ring (MS-SPRing) in SDH networks), protecting against and {{recovering from a}} network failure in 50 ms or less, a significant improvement over the recovery time supported in DCS-based mesh restoration, and a key driver for the deployment of SONET/SDH ring-based protection.|$|E

40|$|Network {{survivability}} is a {{very important}} issue, especially inoptical networks that carry huge amount of traffic. Network failures which may be caused by human errors, malfunctional systems and natural disaster (eg. Earthquakes and lightening storms), have occurred quite frequently and sometimes with unpredictable consequences. Survivability is defined as the ability of the network to maintain the continuity of service against failures of network components. Pre-configuration and dynamic restoration are two schemes for network survivability. For each scheme, survivability algorithms can be applied at either Optical Channel sublayer (Och) known as link-based. Or, Optical <b>Multiplex</b> <b>Section</b> sublayer (OMS) known as path-based. The efficiency of survivability algorithms can be assessed through such criteria as capacity efficiency, restoration time and quality service. Dynamic restoration is more efficient than pre-configuration in terms of capacity resource utilization, but restoration time is longer and 100 % service recovery cannot be guaranteed because sufficient spare capacity may not be available at the time of failures. Similarly, path-based survivability offers a high performance scheme for utilizing capacity resource, but restoration time is longer than link based survivability...|$|E
40|$|Photonic Networks (PNs) {{enable the}} scaling of fiber-optic {{communications}} to massive capacity by dynamically routing wavelengths (λs) without O-E-O conversion at network nodes. As shown in Fig. 1, the key network elements are ROADMs (reconfigurable optical add/drop modules), which can extract and/or insert wavelengths to/from local transceivers into a wavelength <b>multiplex</b> <b>section</b> traveling along a fiber route, and WXCs (wavelength crossconnects), which can interconnect individual wavelengths among multiplex sections traveling {{in two or}} more fiber routes. Typically, WXC nodes will also incorporate local add/drop function, and the links will be bidirectional on pairs of unidirectional fibers. Such PNs are beginning to be widely deployed, driven largely by the reduced capital cost of electronics. Looking forward, ability to provide dynamic services and easy channel upgrades due to format transparency will be additional advantages. To operate large PNs successfully we will need a suite of new management tools that support dynamic wavelength routing. The tools must promote no-touch provisioning, adaptive fault tolerance, and intelligent performance monitoring with prediction of impending failures, all in a challenging environment of sparse O-E-O locations. In [1], we introduced an {{example of such a}} tool, a digital lightpath labeling system that we call LightLabel.

40|$|In {{the last}} five years the concept of using microarrays of {{biologic}} molecules to allow high-throughput analysis has become commonplace. The number of citations in the scientific literature grew from 4 in 1996 to 242 in 2000 and appears to be growing exponentially. This article describes four types of microarrays and then discusses their current and future impact on the field of pathology or, more specifically, cytopathology. This is not meant to be an exhaustive review of the subject but rather an educational overview. Complete reviews of each array type may be found elsewhere. 1 - 4 The concept behind arrays is that any test that can be done based on nucleic acid or protein interaction can be optimized by arraying the substrates to facilitate high-throughput analysis. For example, a Northern blot can be used to assess the expression level of a single mRNA from a single tumor. Reversing the process to make the probe from the tumor RNA, one can examine the expression levels of thousands of genes on a single slide. This is done by collecting and amplifying thousands of known genes and then mechanically placing nanoliter quantities on a specially treated glass slide in a matrix pattern. Then, instead of measuring the expression level of a single gene, levels of thousands of genes can be assessed both quantitatively and simultaneously. The four most prominent types of arrays are (1) oligonucleotide arrays, (2) cDNA arrays, (3) protein arrays, and (4) tissue microarrays. Affymetrix (founded in 1993) is the company that patented and has developed oligonucleotide arrays. It uses a process similar to that used for construction of silicon wafers in the computer industry to mask or unmask specific locations to allow the construction of defined-sequence, unique oligonucleotides across a microscopic area of a silicon chip. The cDNA array was first developed in the laboratories of Brown and Davis at Stanford University. 5 They developed robotic devices that used tiny quill needles to deposit nanoliter quantities of solution containing purified, sequence-verified genes onto glass slides. Protein arrays are less well established but have used similar devices to spot purified proteins onto prepared surfaces. Finally, tissue microarrays are spots of tissue arrayed by <b>multiplexed</b> <b>sectioning</b> of needle core biopsies of conventional histologic tissue blocks. The following paragraphs explain each of these arrays and discuss their current and future applications...|$|R
40|$|Volume Holographic Data Storage Systems (HDSS) {{has been}} of {{interest}} for almost seven decades, and are now considered as a viable option for Write Once Read Many (WORM) cold data storage applications. Thanks to the Bragg selectivity of thick volume holograms, HDSS stores several hundreds of holograms {{on top of each}} other, called multiplexed data pages, by which data recording density can be substantially increased compared to surface recordings. On the other hand, signal intensity upon reconstruction of such multiplexed data pages inversely scales with number of multiplexing squared. Therefore, longer detection time and/or a high power laser along with a large dynamic range material is needed to make HDSS a truly viable "fast and high density" option for WORM applications. Historically, the trade-off between data density and data rate is well recognized. The challenge has been partially solved by continuous efforts such as improvement of materials, optical architectures, opto-mechanical systems and signal processing [1, 2]. In this dissertation, we provide an additional pathway for HDSS to further increase both data density and transfer rates which is Cavities Enhancement Techniques for HDSS, to overcome the fundamental tradeoff. Key ideas are: recycling light with cavity to enhance data rate, and increasing number of multiplexing by combining cavity-eigenmode multiplexing, a subset of orthogonal phasecode multiplexing, with angular multiplexing. Based on this idea, we design and demonstrate Cavity-enhanced HDSS {{in such a way that}} we increase data rate and/or data density by at least factor of 2 while taking advantage of previous improvements as they are, or only with the minimum amount of modifications. In Section 1, we review history of HDSS and summarize the latest research results of HDSS and requirements on modern optical data storage systems as they relate to our solutions. In Section 2, theory of volume holography is reviewed by emphasizing understanding of angular and orthogonal phase code <b>multiplexing.</b> In <b>Section</b> 3 the theory of cavity enhanced reference arms is presented. We discuss how cavities provide a coherent boost to the beam power, which can be used in recording to alleviate source power requirements and/or increase the data recording rate and demonstrate the enhancement experimentally. Beyond basic enhancement, cavities also enable orthogonal phase code multiplexing via cavity eigenmodes. In Section 4, we experimentally demonstrate angular and orthogonal phase code hybrid multiplexing to overcome the limitation of the maximum number of multiplexing imposed by the geometrical constraints of angular <b>multiplexing.</b> In <b>Section</b> 5, novel aspects of the research are discussed in conjunction with the application of the technology for commercial use. Conclusions and future research direction are addressed in Section 6...|$|R

40|$|Communication network constructions {{based on}} the {{synchronous}} digital hierarchy (SDH) are widely used in design and operation of telephone networks and data transfer ones {{on the basis of}} dedicated links. The providing the link for data transmission from one node to another one is a nontrivial objective. The network equipment vendors, as a rule, may provide also a network system control. However, these systems can be used only with the manufacturer's equipment, but are not intended for finding the optimal paths for the current network operation. They serve for examination to choose a network structure at the stage of its development or modernization for the known in advance matrix of connections. From the practice it is seen that the real networks structures use diverse equipment. Therefore to develop a complex to find the paths in SDH-based network is a challenge. Dijkstra algorithm is implemented to find the shortest network path routings in the complex. The use of the classical algorithm is impossible because of the restrictions in providing main and reserve links. There are multiplex sections with no routes to be expected. Such restriction is due to real arrangement of some multiplex sections in the same cables, but in different fibres. When providing the main link, the appropriate structuring sections should be preferable. For example, the link E 3 (34 Mbit/s) can pass only across the section of relevant configuration. The reserve link cannot pass across those multiplex sections where the main link has passed. This rule is not 'extra' considering the first restriction since the main and reserve link sections cannot crisscross the node. At the dead ends reserving has no sense, and the reserve link has to coincide with the main one to save a <b>multiplex</b> <b>section</b> resource of terminal switching. In implementation all these restrictions have been taken into consideration. In addition to the path routings, complex enables saving information on the network nodes, sections, and links in database (DB) i. e., actually, it represents a DB with graphic interface, thereby allowing an operator to have rapid information on its state. Thus, the developed software complex enables finding the main and reserve path routes for the links in structurally complicated SDH network, taking into account the restrictions due to real network features, and an operator of Moscow Fiber Optic Network, Joint-Stock Company "KOMKOR" actively uses it. </p...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of photosensitivity {{and the ability to}} change the refractive index in optical fibre with a period comparable to the wavelength of the transmitted light became practical [1, 2], the applications of Bragg gratings have near exploded in the number of systems-utilities. The field now have progressed to an extend where nearly all aspects of transmission systems technology either have the potential or indeed already include Bragg grating devices in one form or another. The advantages using Bragg gratings in systems contexts are many, but a major reason for their employment is their relative ease of manufacture and all-fibre nature making them compatible with existing network fibre thus enhancing transparency of the total network. Roughly speaking a transmission system (Fig. 1) can be split up into a number of sections being, a transmitter <b>section</b> (including <b>multiplexing),</b> a transmission <b>section</b> (including amplification), a regeneration section, which can be either a retiming or reshaping or both, this section typically includes dispersion control of some sort as well, and finally a receiver section which in part can be an add-drop section. In each of these sections there are applications of Bragg gratings that can replace existing components and in many cases even enhance overall system-performance. We will in this presentation discuss some of the latest advances in the fields of systems applications of fibre Bragg grating devices and related technologies and discuss some new approaches to increase data-capacity in the existing systems...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this dissertation centers around the development of analytical tools {{for the study of}} advanced proteomics. Section 1 of this work reviews the need for high efficiency protein separation techniques. Dynamic isoelectric focusing (DIEF) is new technique similar to capillary isoelectric focusing (CIEF) invented by Dr. Luke Tolley at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. Using DIEF, the electric field inside the separation capillary can be modified using high voltage electrodes, additional to the anode and cathode, to control the depth and shape of the resulting pH gradient. By changing the pH gradient, the location and width of focused protein bands can be controlled. As a new analytical technique, the development of DIEF required the design and fabrication of special holders which allow for electrical connections to be made at lengths along the separation capillary. These holders were also designed to have a removable section of capillary to extract very specific pH range proteins from high-resolution separations. Higher throughput DIEF systems were investigated, as well as <b>multiplexed</b> DIEF systems. <b>Section</b> 2 covers the topic of dynamic isoelectric/anisotropy ligand binding assay (DIABLA). DIABLA is a new method used to identify proteins in a complex sample that bind to a known molecule. DIABLA {{has the potential to be}} used in two complimentary ways, discovery mode and scanning mode. Both modes are accomplished by using DIEF, followed by fluorescence anisotropy as a sensitive detection method. This allows the entire length of capillary to be scanned to identify areas of non-zero anisotropy, which indicate binding interactions between the protein and target molecule. The binding protein(s) can then be extracted using the removable section of capillary from the DIEF holder, and can be identified by using a second dimension analysis, such as LC/MS/MS. DIABLA was verified in a series of proof-of-concept experiments in both discovery and scanning modes. These experiments involved fluorescently tagging proteins that were focused in the presence of a ligand tagged with a different fluorophore. The usefulness of DIABLA as a separation technique was demonstrated in four specific analyses of complex protein samples in Chapter 10...|$|R
