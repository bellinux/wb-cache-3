40|$|Using a {{realistic}} nonlinear mathematical model for melanoma dynamics and {{the technique of}} optimal dynamic inversion (exact feedback linearization with static optimization), a multimodal automatic <b>drug</b> <b>dosage</b> strategy is proposed in this paper for complete regression of melanoma cancer in humans. The proposed strategy computes different <b>drug</b> <b>dosages</b> and gives a nonlinear state feedback solution for driving the number of cancer cells to zero. However, {{it is observed that}} when tumor is regressed to certain value, then there is no need of external <b>drug</b> <b>dosages</b> as immune system and other therapeutic states are able to regress tumor at a sufficiently fast rate which is more than exponential rate. As model has three different <b>drug</b> <b>dosages,</b> after applying dynamic inversion philosophy, <b>drug</b> <b>dosages</b> can be selected in optimized manner without crossing their toxicity limits. The combination of <b>drug</b> <b>dosages</b> is decided by appropriately selecting the control design parameter values based on physical constraints. The process is automated for all possible combinations of the chemotherapy and immunotherapy <b>drug</b> <b>dosages</b> with preferential emphasis of having maximum possible variety of drug inputs at any given point of time. Simulation study with a standard patient model shows that tumor cells are regressed from 2 x 107 to order of 105 cells because of external <b>drug</b> <b>dosages</b> in 36. 93 days. After this no external <b>drug</b> <b>dosages</b> are required as immune system and other therapeutic states are able to regress tumor at greater than exponential rate and hence, tumor goes to zero (less than 0. 01) in 48. 77 days and healthy immune system of the patient is restored. Study with different chemotherapy drug resistance value is also carried out. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Medication {{errors are}} {{considered}} as fatal and critical complications of treatment. Thousands of medication errors committed by medical and paramedical staff are being reported, annually. This study aimed at evaluating {{the effects of}} continuous education on nurses’ knowledge and skill of <b>drug</b> <b>dosage</b> calculation. Methods: This study was an educational random trial with pre-post tests, {{before and after the}} educational intervention. Solomon four group design was used in this research. Subjects of the study (n= 100) were randomly assigned according to official registration number, from all nurses (n= 220) who replied to formal announcement in the University’s website and written notice attached on the boards in clinical settings. Educational intervention was planned according to subjects’ educational needs in regards to <b>drug</b> <b>dosage</b> calculation in workshop format. Results: The results of this study indicated that the scores in each sub-tests including injectable drugs (P= 0. 001), soluble drugs (P< 0. 000), <b>drug</b> <b>dosage</b> concentration (P< 0. 000) and infusion solutions (P= 0. 007) significantly increased after educational intervention. The results indicated that there were significant differences in subjects’ scores in the four groups (P< 0. 000). The results showed that a significant difference existed between the scores obtained by the main group of nurses and other groups. Conclusion: Findings of this study confirm the effectiveness of educational intervention in improving nurses’ knowledge and skill in <b>drug</b> <b>dosage</b> calculation and they show that the participant nurses were in profound need for continuous education in regards to injectable <b>drug</b> <b>dosage</b> calculation. This finding is in line with most other research projects all over the world which indicate the necessity of educational interventions to meet nurses’ educational needs...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we control {{the amount of}} three major {{biological}} cell types (normal, immune and tumor cells) under uncertainty in cancer model parameters, using different chemotherapy <b>drug</b> <b>dosages.</b> To achieve this goal, an adaptive robust controller is proposed for a third order nonlinear model, which consists {{of the interaction between}} normal, immune and tumor cells. We adjust the <b>drug</b> <b>dosages</b> to control the tumor growth and maintain immune and normal cells in their desired values. Due to tumor micro-environmental and biological changes and measurement inaccuracies, the exact quantity of the model parameters is not available. Therefore, it is necessary to design the controller {{in a way that it}} is robust against parameters uncertainty and variations, the proposed robust adaptive controller manipulates the <b>drug</b> <b>dosages</b> and estimates the parameters of the model, simultaneously. The resulting system is robust against parameters uncertainty and variations. The global stability and tracking convergence of the controller is proved using time-varying Lyapunov function. Moreover, extended Kalman filter observer is applied to estimate the immune cells, due to the difficulty measuring them during the biological in vivo experiments. The performance of the proposed controller and observer are investigated by computational results. Computational results show the desired effect of <b>drug</b> <b>dosage</b> injections on the normal, immune and tumor cells. We observe that the controller guarantees the robust performance against the parameters uncertainty. The extended Kalman filter observer has effective performance and estimates the immune cells with high accuracy. This approach could impact robust tumor control using appropriate <b>drug</b> <b>dosages</b> while the parameters of the model change over time in a patient and across different patients.

Aim: The literature review of papers relevant with the mathematical knowledge and drug calculation skills of nurses and nursing students. Material-Method: A search of published research and review articles from January 1989 until March 2012, has been conducted in Pubmed database. The search terms used were: nurses, mathematics skills, numeracy skills and medication dosology calculation skills. Results: Literature review showed that many studies focus in the mathematical knowledge and <b>drug</b> <b>dosage</b> calculation competency of nursing students. Results from these studies revealed that nursing students had poor mathematical knowledge and <b>drug</b> <b>dosage</b> calculation skills. In contrast with students, professional nurses {{are more likely to}} have sufficient skills in drug calculations.

40|$|Medications are {{commonly}} used interventions in healthcare. As our population ages and the prevalence of chronic health challenges increases, medication management has become increasingly complex. Although medication management is a collaborative team effort among health care providers, nurses have {{a major role in}} the clinical assessment and monitoring of patients.

There is a growing body of literature that highlights gaps in knowledge and applied skills of nursing students and practicing nurses in pharmacology content and <b>drug</b> <b>dosage</b> calculations. Teaching pharmacology, <b>drug</b> <b>dosage</b> calculations, and medication administration techniques requires innovative strategies to promote student learning, achievement of outcomes, and life-long learning principles in undergraduate nursing education.

The CVPP schedule gave: (1) a constant <b>drug</b> <b>dosage</b> for each patient independent of body surface or weight; and (2) a total <b>drug</b> <b>dosage</b> dependent on haematological tolerance, since the treatment was given for 21 days or until the leukocyte count dropped to 2 x 10 (9) l- 1.

There is increasing interest to find drug combinations to treat HSV- 1 by reducing drug resistance and cytotoxicity.

We show how the sequential use of two-level and three-level fractional factorial designs can screen for important drugs and drug interactions, as well as determine potential optimal <b>drug</b> <b>dosages</b> {{through the use of}} contour plots. Our initial experiment using a two-level fractional factorial design suggests that there is model inadequacy and that <b>drug</b> <b>dosages</b> should be reduced.

40|$|Background: We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the possible factors determining reduction of dopaminergic drugs in patients who received bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS). Methods: We studied 33 consecutive Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients who underwent bilateral STN DBS between March 2002 and April 2006. Patients were assessed at baseline and 6 months and 1 year after surgery. Results: The dose of dopaminergic drugs was significantly decreased by 16. 5 % (p< 0. 05) and 14. 9 % (p< 0. 05), at post op 6 months and 12 months respectively. The reduction rate of dopaminergic drugs after bilateral STN DBS {{was positively correlated with}} the dopaminergic <b>drug</b> <b>dosage</b> at baseline (p< 0. 05) and was negatively correlated with the scores of “off”-period UPDRS II (p< 0. 05), III (p< 0. 001), and total UPDRS (p< 0. 001) at baseline.
