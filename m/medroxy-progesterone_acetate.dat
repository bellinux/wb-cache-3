40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} efficacy {{and the influence of}} progestogen-only contraceptives (POCs) in postpartum lactating mothers over a period of 18 -months. 250 mothers were randomised to either the study groups or the control group. In the study groups, 100 mothers were given an oral progestogen pill; lynestrenol and another 100 mothers were assigned to injectable progestogens; depot <b>medroxy-progesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> (DMPA) and norethisterone oenanthate (NET EN), 50 each. The control group (n= 50) was given nonhormonal methods. There was no contraceptive failure or negative influence on lactation among the medication groups.

40|$|Previously, we {{have shown}} that chronic {{treatment}} with allopregnanolone (ALLO) for three months impaired learning function in the Swe/PS 1 mouse model. ALLO is a neurosteroid, produced in the CNS and a GABAA receptor agonist. ALLO modulates the general inhibitory system in the CNS by enhancing the effect of GABA. Chronic treatment with other GABAA receptor active compounds, such as benzodiazepines, ethanol and <b>medroxy-progesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> has been associated to cognitive decline and/or increased risk for dementia. In this study, we sufficed with a treatment period of one month for the Swe/PS 1 mouse, and included another Alzheimer's disease mouse model; the Swe/Arc model. We found that one month of chronic treatment with elevated ALLO levels within physiological range impaired learning and memory function in the Swe/Arc female and male mice. Male Swe/PS 1 mice also showed marginally impaired function, while the female mice did not. Furthermore, the chronic ALLO treatment caused increased levels of soluble Aβ in the Swe/PS 1 mouse model while the levels were unchanged in the Swe/Arc model. Therefore, both Swe/Arc and Swe/PS 1 mice showed signs of accelerated disease progression. Still, further studies are required to determine the mechanisms behind the cognitive impairment and the increased Aβ-levels caused by mildly elevated ALLO-levels...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between changes in {{body condition score}} (BCS) during the postpartum and fertility in beef cows suckling calves under extensive conditions were investigated. Cows were subjected to four BCS evaluations over the postpartum period, starting around one month after calving. In the second evaluation cows were treated with <b>medroxy-progesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> impregnated pessaries and received an injection of estradiol benzoate. At the third evaluation, pessaries were removed and calves were separated from the cows for 96 hours, during which time estrous was observed twice a day, and animals artificially inseminated 12 hours after detection. When calves returned to their dams, bulls were introduced until a 60 -day mating period was reached. The distribution of BCS differed among calving groups and evaluations. Results indicated that only cows comprising a BCS 3 (1 to 5 scale) around the first month postpartum {{can be used in}} an artificial insemination program with possibilities of becoming pregnant. There was no statistical difference between the calving groups in pregnancy rate.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of <b>medroxy-progesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> (MAP) with or without estradiol benzoate (EB) on follicular growth during the estrous cycle in cattle. In the first experiment, Hereford cows were synchronized with a synthetic analogue of PGF 2 alpha and were treated with two different doses of MAP (250 or 500 mg) with or without EB for 7 days starting on day 8 of the estrous cycle. Follicular growth was inhibited (P< 0. 05) in all cows except controls and those receiving 250 mg MAP without EB. Seventy-five percent of the animals (15 / 20) showed estrus on days 21 and 22 of the cycle rather than at MAP withdrawal, demonstrating that these treatments did not induce estrus. To determine whether the EB treatment altered endometrial sensitivity to oxytocin and thus the luteolytic cascade, multiparous pre-synchronized cows received 5 mg of EB followed 6 hours later with 50 IU of oxytocin (OT; n= 9). Eight hours after EB injection, endometrial fragments were collected from the cows on days 4, 13 and 17 of the estrous cycle and COX- 2 gene expression was measured by PCR. EB increased COX- 2 mRNA levels only on day 17 of the estrous cycle (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, MAP alone or associated with EB is able to suppress bovine follicular growth.

Twenty-nine women participated in the study: 14 women with clinical and endocrinologic features of PCOS and 15 age- and weight-matched normal cycling women. Each subject was assigned randomly to receive either a tablet of cabergoline at the dose of 0. 5 mg/wk or placebo for 4 months. Sixteen subjects (PCOS: n = 8; controls: n = 8) received cabergoline, whereas 13 (PCOS: n = 6; controls: n = 7) received placebo. Both before and during the 4 th month of treatment, blood samples were collected every 10 minutes from 9 : 00 A. M. to 3 : 00 P. M., 3 to 7 days after spontaneous or <b>medroxy-progesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> (MPA; 5 mg daily for 5 days) -induced menses. Follicle-stimulating hormone and androgen levels were measured in the basal samples, whereas LH levels were measured in all samples. Menstrual cyclicity, LH pulsatility, and circulating levels of FSH, PRL, E 2, total T, free T, androstenedione, 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, DHEAS, and sex hormone-binding globulin. Both in controls and in PCOS-affected women, cabergoline administration blunted plasma PRL levels without affecting LH pulsatility. Androgen levels were reduced in controls and normalized in PCOS. Cabergoline, but not placebo, induced menses reappearance in amenorrheic and a normalization of menstrual cyclicity in oligoamenorrheic women with PCOS. The administration of cabergoline is capable to normalize androgen levels and to improve menstrual cyclicity in PCOS-affected women.

40|$|Objective: Differentiation of endometrial stromal {{cells into}} decidual cells {{is crucial for}} optimal endometrial receptivity. Data from our {{previous}} microarray study implied that expression of many cell cycle regulators are changed during decidualization and inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro. In this study, we hypothesized that both the classic progestin treatment and DNA methylation inhibition would inhibit stromal cell proliferation and cell cycle transition. Methods: The human endometrial stromal cell line (HESC) was treated from 2 days to 18 days with the DNA methylation inhibitor, 5 -aza- 2 ’-deoxycytidine (AZA), a mixture of estradiol/progestin/cyclic adenosine monophosphate ([cAMP]; <b>medroxy-progesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> [MPA mix]) or both. Cell growth was measured by cell counting, cell cycle transition and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry, expression of cell cycle regulators were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blotting, and change in DNA methylation profiles were detected by methylation-specific PCR. Results: Both AZA and MPA mix inhibited the proliferation of HESC for at least 7 days. Treatment with MPA mix resulted in an early G 0 /G 1 inhibition followed by G 2 /M phase inhibition at 18 days. In contrast, AZA treatment inhibited cell cycle progression at the G 2 /M phase throughout. The protein levels of p 21 Cip 1 and 14 - 3 - 3 swere increased with both AZA and MPA mix treatments without {{any change in the}} DNAmethylation profiles of the genes. Conclusions: Our data imply that the decidualization of HESC is associated with cell cycle arrest at G 0 /G 1 phase initially and G 2 /M phase at later stages. Our results also suggest that p 53 pathway members {{play a role in the}} cell cycle regulation of endometrial stromal cells...|$|E
40|$|Progesterone, {{estrogen}} and {{cyclic adenosine monophosphate}} (cAMP) together regulate the decidualization of human endometrial stromal cells in a time-dependent manner. The role of DNA methylation and the three active DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in the regulation of decidualization is gaining interest but the exact role of this epigenetic mechanism during decidualization is largely unknown. We aimed to understand {{the effect of the}} main regulators of decidualization on the expression of the DNMTs and in turn on the expression of steroid hormone receptors during the decidualization. We conducted a time-course analysis from 6 h to 10 days to examine the change in gene expression of the DNMTs and the steroid hormone receptors over time in response to estradiol, <b>medroxy-progesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> (MPA) and dibutyryl-cAMP (db-cAMP) in a human endometrial stromal cells (HESC) cell line. Only the combination treatment with MPA-mix (estradiol + MPA + db-cAMP) up-regulated ERα PGR, progesterone receptor B (PRB) and androgen receptor at 24 h. Both decidualization pathways of db-cAMP and estradiol/MPA, independently and combined, consistently down-regulated DNMT 3 B mRNA expression from 6 h till 10 days, whereas DNMT 1 and DNMT 3 A mRNA expression were down-regulated transiently. Forced expression of DNMT 3 B in HESC for 10 days attenuated IGFBP 1 mRNA and protein expression; and forced expression of DNMT 3 B combined with MPA-mix treatment synergistically increased the expression of PRB at 24 h. The HESC morphology and proliferation remained unchanged in response to forced expression of DNMT 3 B. In conclusion, mRNA expression of the DNMTs during decidualization is dynamic, so that expression varies according to the cAMP or estradiol/MPA pathway treatments that regulate them in a time-dependent manner. Although forced expression of DNMT 3 B by itself is insufficient to inhibit decidualization, forced expression of DNMT 3 B in combination with MPA-mix synergistically up-regulated PRB, as well as attenuated the expression of IGFBP 1, the decidualization marker...|$|E
40|$|Background: Artificial {{insemination}} is {{an established}} and viable technique {{to accelerate the}} genetic advancement and economic return of the cattle. However, compromises the efficiency of detection of estrus results in low insemination rates. To avoid these problems in beef herd, synchronization protocols have been developed that allow inseminate large number of animals within a set period of time. These treatments are known as protocols for synchronization of ovulation for fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI). There are several slow-release progesterone or progestins devices {{on the market for}} use in synchronization of estrus/ovulation programs in cattle, but these devices have a high cost, which results in less use of these protocols by farmers. This study aimed to determine the follicular dynamic of a low cost protocol to synchronize ovulation, which uses vaginal sponges impregnated with <b>medroxy-progesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> (MPA; group 1) and compare it with two trade protocols (groups 2 and 3). Materials, Methods & Results: Nine Braford cows, multiparous non-lactating, cyclic and BCS > 3 (BCS = 1 extremely lean cows and BCS = 5 obese cows) where used in these trial. The animals were divided into three treatments, which all animals went for three treatments in four replicates. (Continue 0 Group 1 (n = 14), animals received on day 0, a vaginal sponge impregnated with 250 mg MPA and an intramuscular (i. m.) application of 2 mg of estradiol benzoate (EB); on day 8, the vaginal sponge was removed and applied i. m. 0. 5 mg cloprostenol and 24 h latter was applied i. m. 1 mg of EB. Group 2 (n = 7), the animals received on day 0, a silicone vaginal implant with 1 g of progesterone and an application i. m. of 2 mg of EB; on day 8, the implant was removed and applied i. m. 0. 5 mg cloprostenol and 24 h latter was applied i. m. 1 mg of EB. Group 3 (n = 8), the animals received on day 0, a silicone ear implant impregnated with 3 mg norgestomet and an application i. m. of 3 mg norgestomet and 5 mg of estradiol valerate; on the 9 th day the implant was removed. From day 0, animals were examined daily by trans-rectal ultrasound with an 8 MHz linear transducer to monitor follicular and luteal dynamics. After removal of the implant in group 3 and after application of 1 mg EB in the other groups, the animals were evaluated by ultrasound two times per day until ovulation was detected. In group 1, seven animals lost a vaginal sponge impregnated with MPA and the data were removed from analysis. The emergence of follicular wave for groups 1, 2 and 3 occurred, respectively, 3. 7 ± 1. 1, 3. 7 ± 0. 7 and 4. 9 ± 1. 1 days, with a statistical trend (P < 0. 06) to occur earlier in groups 1 and 2 than in group 3. There was no statistical difference between groups in other variables. The interval between wave emergence and ovulation occurred in 7. 4 ± 0. 9, 7. 3 ± 0. 7 and 7. 6 ± 1. 3 days (P = 0. 82); the interval between implant removal and ovulation occurred in 66 ± 12, 66 ± 0 and 70. 5 ± 12. 7 hours (P = 0. 62); the dominant follicle diameter at implant removal was 10. 9 ± 2. 6, 12. 7 ± 2. 1 and 10. 3 ± 2. 1 mm (P = 0. 13); and the larger diameter of the dominant follicle was 15. 3 ± 2. 9, 16. 6 ± 1. 3 and 15. 9 ± 1. 5 mm (P = 0. 49) for groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Discussion: In this experiment, the protocols used in groups 1, 2 and 3 were effective in promoting the emergence of a synchronized new follicular wave and promote synchronized ovulation of a follicle with few days of dominance and an appropriate diameter. It was observed that numerical variations on the emergence of the new follicular wave numerically influenced in the timing ovulations. A study with a larger number of animals per group should be performed to confirm these differences between the groups...|$|E

Métodos: foram incluídas, retrospectivamente 47 pacientes com sangramento uterino anormal, submetidas a curetagem uterina diagnóstica e/ou biópsia de endométrio, cujo achado histopatológico foi de hiperplasia de endométrio. Nas pacientes com hiperplasia sem atipia foi iniciado a terapêutica com acetato de medroxiprogesterona por via oral, na dose de 10 mg/dia durante 10 - 12 dias por mês. Nas com atipia, era utilizado o acetato de megestrol por via oral, dose de 160 mg/dia, uso contínuo. O período de tratamento variou de 3 a 18 meses. Biópsia de endométrio e/ou curetagem uterina de controle foram realizadas entre três e seis meses do início do tratamento e periodicamente para avaliar a resposta terapêutica. Resultados: foram analisadas 42 pacientes com hiperplasia endometrial sem atipia e cinco com atipia. A média de idade das pacientes foi de 49, 5 ± 10, 6 anos, sendo 70, 2 % com idade superior a 45 anos. O acetato de medroxiprogesterona foi eficaz em fazer regredir as hiperplasias sem atipias em 83, 2 % (35 / 42) e o acetato de megestrol em 80 % (4 / 5) das hiperplasias com atipia. Em 16, 8 % (7 casos) das hiperplasias sem atipia e em 20 % (1 caso) das com atipia, ocorreu persistência das lesões, apesar do tratamento. Em nenhum caso ocorreu progressão para câncer de endométrio, durante o período de seguimento que foi de 3 meses a 9 anos. No acompanhamento dessas pacientes, verificamos que 18 (38, 3 %) apresentaram amenorréia, em 12 (25, 5 %) ocorreu regularização do ciclo menstrual e 17 (36, 2 %) permaneceram com sangramento uterino anormal, sendo submetidas a histerectomia total abdominal. O exame anatomopatológico mostrou a persistência da lesão hiperplásica em oito casos, leiomioma em quatro, adenomiose em três, mio-hipertrofia uterina difusa em um caso e útero normal em outro, tendo havido regressão das lesões hiperplásicas nesses últimos nove casos. Conclusões: o tratamento das hiperplasias de endométrio com acetato de medroxiprogesterona e/ou acetato de megestrol, representa uma alternativa satisfatória para mulheres que desejam preservar o útero ou que tenham risco cirúrgico elevado. Entretanto, é necessário monitorização cuidadosa do endométrio, o que deve ser realizado pela avaliação dos sintomas, ultra-sonografia transvaginal e biópsia periódica. Purpose: {{to evaluate}} the efficacy of medroxyprogesterone acetate and megestrol acetate in endometrial hyperplasia. Patients and Methods: forty-seven patients with abnormal uterine bleeding were retrospectively evaluated. These patients were submitted to diagnostic uterine curettage and/or endometrial biopsy, with histopathological finding of endometrial hyperplasia. Patients with hyperplasia without atypia received 10 mg/day oral medroxyprogesterone acetate during 10 to 12 days a month. Those with hyperplasia with atypia received 160 mg/day oral megestrol acetate continuously. The length of treatment ranged from 3 to 18 months. Control endometrial biopsy and/or uterine curettage were performed 3 and 6 months {{from the beginning of}} treatment, and then periodically to evaluate whether or not regression of hyperplasia occurred. Results: forty-two patients with endometrial hyperplasia without atypia and 5 with hyperplasia with atypia were included. The mean age of the patients was 49. 5 ± 10. 6 years (22 to 72 years), 70. 2 % aged over 45 years. <b>Medroxy-progesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> was effective in promoting regression of 83. 2 % (35 / 42) of hyperplasia without atypia, and megestrol acetate in 80 % (4 / 5) of hyperplasia with atypia. Despite treatment, lesions persisted in 16. 8 % (7 cases) of hyperplasia with atypia and in 20 % (1 case) of hyperplasia without atypia. No progression to endometrial cancer was seen during the follow-up period of 3 months to 9 years. During follow-up, we found that 18 patients (38. 3 %) showed amenorrhea, 12 (25. 5 %) menstrual cycle regulation, and 17 (36. 2 %) persistent abnormal uterine bleeding and underwent total abdominal hysterectomy. Histological examination of the uterus showed 8 patients with persistence of hyperplastic lesion, 4 with leiomyoma, 3 with adenomyosis, 1 with diffuse uterine myohypertrophy, and 1 with normal uterus, despite regression of the hyperplastic lesions in 9 of the 17 patients. Conclusions: the treatment of endometrial hyperplasia with medroxyprogesterone acetate and megestrol acetate can be a safe alternative for women who refuse to have their uterus removed or those at high risk for surgery. However, a careful monitoring of the endometrium is needed. This can be achieved with periodical endometrial biopsy, transvaginal ultrasonography, and evaluation of the symptoms...|$|E
