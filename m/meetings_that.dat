5|$|Enron's audit {{committee}} was later criticized for its brief <b>meetings</b> <b>that</b> would cover {{large amounts of}} material. In one meeting on February 12, 2001, the committee met {{for an hour and}} a half. Enron's {{audit committee}} did not have the technical knowledge to question the auditors properly on accounting issues related to the company's special purpose entities. The committee was also unable to question the company's management due to pressures on the committee. The United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs' report accused the board members of allowing conflicts of interest to impede their duties as monitoring the company's accounting practices. When Enron's scandal became public, the audit committee's conflicts of interest were regarded with suspicion.|$|E
5|$|In November of {{that year}} the same group planted a bomb that blew out the front of Nussbaum's house, while {{he and his wife}} were {{sleeping}} there. Nussbaum blamed the bombings on local antisemitism and bigotry, but most of his congregation blamed it on Nussbaum's anti-segregationist activism. Though the congregation officially supported him, a number of members privately urged him to leave Beth Israel and find another pulpit. The synagogue's board of trustees voted to prohibit non-Jewish groups from using the synagogue's premises unless they had prior approval from the board; the intent was to put an end to the interracial <b>meetings</b> <b>that</b> Nussbaum held there.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{events had}} moved from local agitations against the British crown to {{outright}} war. Early on, Trigg served in local militias, but he also represented Fincastle in the Virginia Conventions. These were five political <b>meetings</b> <b>that</b> started after Lord Dunmore, the governor of Virginia, had dissolved the House of Burgesses after its delegates expressed solidarity with Boston, Massachusetts, where the harbor had been closed by the British. Trigg was at the first convention in 1774 and was elected a delegate to the second convention in 1775, {{though he did not}} attend. He was elected to the third convention (July–August 1775), and did appear. He was also a delegate to the Fourth Convention (December 1775– January 1776), but did not attend.|$|E
5|$|Although Joachim von Ribbentrop {{had been}} named Foreign Minister in February 1938, Göring {{continued}} to involve himself in foreign affairs. That July, he contacted the British government {{with the idea that}} he should make an official visit to discuss Germany's intentions for Czechoslovakia. Neville Chamberlain was in favour of a meeting, and there was talk of a pact being signed between Britain and Germany. In February 1938, Göring visited Warsaw to quell rumours about the upcoming invasion of Poland. He had conversations with the Hungarian government that summer as well, discussing their potential role in an invasion of Czechoslovakia. At the Nuremberg Rally that September, Göring and other speakers denounced the Czechs as an inferior race that must be conquered. Chamberlain met with Hitler in a series of <b>meetings</b> <b>that</b> led to the signing of the Munich Agreement (29 September 1938), which turned over control of the Sudetenland to Germany. In March 1939, Göring threatened Czechoslovak president Emil Hácha with the bombing of Prague. Hácha then agreed to sign a communique accepting the German occupation of the remainder of Bohemia and Moravia.|$|E
5|$|Following his defeat, Cooper resumed the {{practice}} of law in the Washington, D.C. firm of Gardner, Morison and Rogers. In 1949, President Truman appointed Cooper as one of five delegates to the United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly. He was an alternate delegate to that body in 1950 and 1951. Secretary of State Dean Acheson chose Cooper as his advisor to <b>meetings</b> <b>that</b> created the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and at meetings of the NATO Council of Ministers in London in May 1950 and Brussels in December 1950. Political historian Glenn Finch observed that, while Cooper was well-qualified for his duties at the U.N. and NATO, his presence abroad also made him less available to campaign for the Senate seat vacated by Barkley's elevation to the vice-presidency. Speculation was raised that Clements, who won Barkley's old seat in a special election in 1950, may have influenced Truman and Acheson to make the appointments.|$|E

5|$|Kuznetsova and Agnieszka Radwańska {{have played}} each other {{eighteen}} times since 2007, with Kuznetsova leading the head-to-head 14–4. Their first meeting was at Wimbledon in 2007 with Kuznetsova winning in straight sets. Kuznetsova won their first three meetings, {{but in the}} four <b>meetings</b> <b>that</b> eventuated in 2008, Kuznetsova lost three of them, including {{in the third round}} of the Australian Open and in the fourth round of Wimbledon. Additionally, she also lost against her at the year-end championships later in the year, after Radwańska replaced an injured Ana Ivanovic. Kuznetsova subsequently dominated Radwańska in future meetings, winning six meetings between the pair between 2009 and 2012, including an upset victory at the 2012 French Open, until Radwańska stopped the rot at the 2014 Mutua Madrid Open, saving a match point in the process. Prior to 2014, Kuznetsova's two most recent titles came by defeating Radwańska in the championship match, first at Beijing in 2009 and then at San Diego in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Together, the Permanent Members {{form the}} North Atlantic Council (NAC), a body which meets {{together}} {{at least once}} a week and has effective governance authority and powers of decision in NATO. From time to time the Council also meets at higher level meetings involving foreign ministers, defence ministers or heads of state or government (HOSG) and it is at these <b>meetings</b> <b>that</b> major decisions regarding NATO's policies are generally taken. However, it is worth noting that the Council has the same authority and powers of decision-making, and its decisions have the same status and validity, at whatever level it meets. France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States are together referred to as the Quint, which is an informal discussion group within NATO. NATO summits also form a further venue for decisions on complex issues, such as enlargement.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United and Chelsea {{had played}} each other 150 times {{prior to the}} Champions League final, with 18 {{meetings}} in domestic cup competitions (including the FA Community Shield). Due to various historical restrictions regarding the number of teams from the same country entering European competitions, they had never met in Europe before. Manchester United held {{the upper hand in}} the teams' 150 previous meetings, winning 65 times to Chelsea's 41, with 44 draws. Their cup record was equally good, winning 10 of the 18 cup meetings, with the remaining eight ties split equally between draws and Chelsea wins. However, honours were even in cup finals, with Manchester United having won the 1994 FA Cup Final 4–0, while Chelsea won the 2007 FA Cup Final 1–0, the last cup game between the two sides. Manchester United responded to defeat in the 2007 FA Cup Final by beating Chelsea in the 2007 FA Community Shield the following August, winning 3–0 on penalties after a 1–1 draw in normal time. They went on to claim their 17th league title {{at the end of the}} 2007–08 Premier League season, finishing two points ahead of Chelsea. Both teams went into the final game of the season level on points but United were ahead of Chelsea through their superior goal difference. In the two sides' league <b>meetings</b> <b>that</b> season, United won 2–0 at Old Trafford in Avram Grant's first game in charge of Chelsea on 23 September 2007, while Chelsea won 2–1 at Stamford Bridge in the return game on 26 April 2008.|$|E
