40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} benefits of individual cover crop species, but the value of diverse cover crop mixtures has received less attention. The objectives of this research were {{to determine the effects}} of spring-sown cover crop mixture diversity and <b>mechanical</b> <b>cover</b> crop termination method on cover crop and/or cash crop productivity, soil moisture and N, and profitability in an organic cropping system. An experiment was conducted between 2009 and 2011 near Mead, Nebraska, where mixtures of two (2 CC), four (4 CC), six (6 CC), and eight (8 CC) cover crop species, or a summer annual weed mixture were included in a sunflower– soybean–corn rotation. Cover crops were terminated in late May using a field disk or sweep plow undercutter. Undercutting cover crops increased soil NO 3 –N (0 – 20 cm) by 1. 0 and 1. 8 mg NO 3 –N kg– 1 relative to disk incorporation in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Cover crop mixtures often reduced soil moisture (0 – 8 cm) before main crop planting, though cover crop termination with the undercutter increased soil moisture content by as much as 0. 024 cm 3 cm– 3 compared to termination with the disk during early main crop growth. Crop yields were not influenced by cover crop mixture, but termination with the undercutter increased corn and soybean yield by as much as 1. 40 and 0. 88 Mg ha– 1, respectively. Despite differences in productivity between spring cover crop mixtures and weed communities, crop yield was not different among these treatments; thus, profitability of the weed mixture–undercutter treatment combination was greatest due to reduced input costs...|$|E

30|$|In the {{beginning}} of HR crop cultivation, resistance management was {{not considered to be}} an issue [67, 88], but this has later changed [89, 90]. For more than a decade now, weed scientists are recommending that farmers should implement an integrated weed management approach that consists of “many little hammers”. These “hammers” include crop and herbicide rotation, <b>mechanical</b> weeding, <b>cover</b> crops, intercropping, and mulching [91, 92]. But continuous HR cropping became common in the Americas, and farmers often simply resorted to higher glyphosate doses, additional applications (often both) and combined use of other herbicides [93]. Paraquat and synthetic auxins are recommended in tank mixtures or in rotation with glyphosate, but resistance to these herbicides is about as common as resistance to glyphosate [76]. New herbicides will not be commercialized within the near future, due to the increased development costs and the challenge to find suitable substances that comply with the stricter regulatory standards for weed efficacy and environmental and toxicological safety [6].|$|R
