25|$|Adolescent {{girls and}} boys who are {{attracted}} to others {{of the same sex}} are strongly affected by their surroundings in that adolescents often decide to express their sexualities or keep them secret depending on certain factors in their societies. These factors affect {{girls and boys}} differently. If girls’ schools and religions are against same sex attractions, they pose the greatest obstacles to girls who experience same sex attractions. These factors were not listed as affecting boys as much. The researchers suggest that <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> because not only are some religions against same-sex attraction, but they also encourage traditional roles for women and do not believe that women can carry out these roles as lesbians. Schools may affect girls more than boys because strong emphasis is placed on girls to date boys, and many school activities place high importance on heterosexuality (such as cheerleading). Additionally, the idea of not conforming to typical male gender roles inhibited many boys from openly expressing their same-sex attraction. The worry of conforming to gender roles didn’t inhibit girls from expressing their same-gender preferences as much, because society is generally more flexible about their gender expression.|$|E

500|$|Richard Cobbet, {{writing in}} PC Gamer UK said: [...] "just <b>maybe,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> going too far", in {{reference}} to images of soldiers' gory corpses cleared from the interface by windscreen wipers. The reviewer expressed bemusement at [...] "Terrorists with robots and plasma guns" [...] antagonists, but reflected – {{in reference to}} Cannon Fodder 2 – [...] "Still, could be worse. They could be time-travelling aliens again." [...] He said the [...] "biggest issue" [...] is that a [...] "gung-ho" [...] approach to play is infeasible and that the [...] "precise and tactical" [...] approach faithful to earlier games in the series [...] "turns {{out to be a}} very different experience from before. Far less satisfying". This is due to the [...] "key problem" [...] of the ease with which enemy weapons such as rocket launcher-armed turrets can destroy the player's soldiers. The player is thus forced [...] "to play with aching, paranoid care, picking away at base defences from as far away as possible, and rubbing up against the save points like a lovely cat finally reunited with its owner. This is not fun." [...] He also complained about the arbitrary death inflicted by exploding barrels [...] "raining down over the entire screen." [...] Cobbet summarised that the departure from the original game meant that Cannon Fodder 3 did not evoke nostalgia and was a [...] "poor substitute" [...] for other action or strategy games. On the other hand, he found the game [...] "admittedly nowhere near as frustrating" [...] as the original. He reflected that it [...] "does have a solid crack at updating the action for a new age, and it's far from as bad as expected" [...] given its obscure development.|$|E

2500|$|Writing for The American Spectator, Jeremy Lott commented {{positively}} {{about the}} protest movement: [...] "While the suits at Comedy Central and Yale University Press have been cowed, {{people across the}} country have decided to speak up and thereby magnify the offense a thousandfold." [...] Helge Rønning, a professor at the Institute of Media and Communication at the University of Oslo, said the offense to Muslims was outweighed by freedom-of-speech concerns. [...] "Indignation from those who claim the right to engage in criticism of religion {{is as important as the}} indignation that comes from the Muslim side," [...] he told the [...] NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation). [...] "I think that this is an attitude that goes deeper than whether these drawings are blasphemous or not." [...] Vebjørn Selbekk, a Norwegian editor who was threatened in 2006 after he reprinted Danish cartoons of Mohammed in his publication, supported the May 20 protest. [...] "I think <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the right way to react—with humor, and also to spread this number, so it isn't only a few who sit with all the threats and all the discomfort associated with defending our freedom of speech in this area," [...] he said.

She is an affectionate little thing, and she throws her arms round his neck and kisses him for it, then and there, outside the shop. But the stupid world (in the person of the boy at the cigar emporium next door) jeers at such tokens of love.
