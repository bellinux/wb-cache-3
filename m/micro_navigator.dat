40|$|Miniature {{high-performance}} low-mass space avionics {{systems are}} desired for planned future outer planetary exploration missions (i. e. Europa Orbiter/Lander, Pluto-Kuiper Express). The spacecraft fuel and mass requirements enabling orbit insertion {{is the driving}} requirement. The <b>Micro</b> <b>Navigator</b> is an integrated autonomous Guidance, Navigation & Control (GN&C) micro-system that would provide the critical avionics function for navigation, pointing, and precision landing. The <b>Micro</b> <b>Navigator</b> hardware and software allow fusion of data from multiple sensors to provide a single integrated vehicle state vector necessary for {{six degrees of freedom}} GN&C. The benefits of this MicroNavigator include: 1) The <b>Micro</b> <b>Navigator</b> employs MEMS devices that promise orders of magnitude reductions in mass power and volume of inertial sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes), celestial sensing devices (startracker, sun sensor), and computing element; 2) The highly integrated nature of the unit will reduce the cost of flight missions. a) The advanced miniaturization technologies employed by the <b>Micro</b> <b>Navigator</b> lend themselves to mass production, and therefore will reduce production cost of spacecraft. b) The integral approach simplifies interface issues associated with discrete components and reduces cost associated with integration and test of multiple components; and 3) The integration of sensors and processing elements into a single unit will allow the <b>Micro</b> <b>Navigator</b> to encapsulate attitude information and determination functions into a single object. This is particularly beneficial for object-oriented software architectures that are used in advanced spacecraft. Additional information is contained in the original extended abstract...|$|E
