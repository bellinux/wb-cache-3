Used in this way, an understanding of vertical distance can become a tool for improved teacher-student communication. On the other hand, a disciplinarian <b>might</b> <b>put</b> this information to use in order to gain psychological advantage over an unruly student.|$|E
25|$|The San Francisco Chamber of Commerce {{has also}} {{expressed}} concerns {{because of the}} burden it <b>might</b> <b>put</b> on retail sales, worsened by the ongoing recession caused by the financial and global economic crises, driving business away as people will go shop elsewhere in the region. A telephone poll, conducted by the Chamber of Commerce by late January 2009, showed that 61% of the voters opposed the congestion fee for driving downtown.|$|E
25|$|In January 2009, {{the press}} {{reported}} that further capital {{may be required}} and that while the government {{might be willing to}} fund this, it may be unable to do so because the previous capital investment from the Qatari state was subject to a proviso that no third party <b>might</b> <b>put</b> in further money without the Qataris receiving compensation at the value the shares had commanded in October 2008.

The {{story is}} cast {{in terms of}} a good side, and a bad side, beauty against {{ruthless}} ugliness, tyranny against kingship, moderated freedom with consent against compulsion that has long lost any object save mere power, and so on; but both sides in some degree, conservative or destructive, want a measure of control. But if you have, as it were, taken 'a vow of poverty', renounced control, and take your delight in things for themselves without reference to yourself, watching, observing, and to some extent knowing, then the questions of the rights and wrongs of power and control might become utterly meaningless to you, and the means of power quite valueless...|$|E
25|$|During {{his last}} years in Gaul, Caesar rightly feared the senate <b>might</b> <b>put</b> him to trial for his {{breaches}} of law {{while he was}} consul. He therefore aimed to run for consul once again without having to enter {{the city as a}} private man (privatus). To do this, the senate needed to allow him to run for the office in absence (in absentia), a matter promoted by his loyal tribune of the plebs, Gaius Scribonius Curio (the younger). Following fierce debates {{over the course of the}} year 50 BC, a minority of the senate party had symbolically handed Pompey a sword on 1 December 50, in a plea that he would raise an army to defend Rome against Caesar, should the latter attack the city when his demands were not met.|$|E
25|$|Sauk warrior Black Hawk, {{the leader}} of a band of Sauks near Rock Island at Saukenuk, was always in {{opposition}} to ceding Native American lands to white settlers and their governments. Black Hawk supported the invalidity of the Treaty of St. Louis (1804) of both the Sauk and Fox nations negotiated with the then Indiana Territory Governor William Henry Harrison. The treaty ceded territory, including Black Hawk's birthplace Saukenuk, to the United States. The Sauk are a consensus decision making society. Their representatives exceeded the authorization of merely taking under consideration what terms the United States government <b>might</b> <b>put</b> forth, bring them back to reach a consensus and then return with their treaty terms. The lack of the tribe discussing the treaty prior to being made official made it invalid by Black Hawk {{and other members of the}} tribe. The representatives never had the tribal authorization to unilaterally cede its lands.|$|E

25|$|In Canada, Arthur, as {{an officer}} with the Montreal {{detachment}} of the Rifle Brigade, undertook a year's training and engaged in defending the Dominion from the Fenian Raids; there was initially concern that his personal involvement in Canada's defence <b>might</b> <b>put</b> the Prince in danger from Fenians and their supporters in the United States, but it was decided his military duty was primary. Following his arrival at Halifax, Arthur toured the country for eight weeks and made a visit in January 1870 to Washington, D.C., where he met with President Ulysses S. Grant. During his service in Canada he was also entertained by Canadian society; amongst other activities, he attended an investiture ceremony in Montreal, was a guest at balls and garden parties, and attended the opening of parliament in Ottawa (becoming {{the first member of}} the Royal Family to do so), all of which was documented in photographs that were sent back for the Queen to view. It was not, however, all social and state functions for Arthur; the Prince was on 25 May 1870 engaged in fending off Fenian invaders during the Battle of Eccles Hill, for which he received the Fenian Medal.|$|E

The mission suffered from problems including an unusually high rate of fuel usage, a malfunctioning horizon indicator, a delayed retrofire for re-entry, and a splashdown that was [...] downrange from the target area. Throughout the mission, Kraft found himself frustrated by the vagueness of Carpenter's communications with Mission Control, and what he perceived as Carpenter's inattention to his duties. [...] "Part of the problem," [...] he recalled, [...] "was that Carpenter either didn't understand or was ignoring my instructions." ...|$|E

Billingham further suggests that an extremely advanced and friendly extraterrestrial civilization <b>might</b> <b>put</b> an end to present-day religious conflicts and lead to greater religious toleration worldwide. On the other hand, Jill Tarter puts forward the view that contact with extraterrestrial intelligence might eliminate religion {{as we know it}} and introduce humanity to an all-encompassing faith. Vakoch doubts that humans would be inclined to adopt extraterrestrial religions, telling ABC News [...] "I think religion meets very human needs, and unless extraterrestrials can provide a replacement for it, I don't think religion is going to go away," [...] and adding, [...] "if there are incredibly advanced civilizations with a belief in God, I don't think Richard Dawkins will start believing." ...|$|E
500|$|Following Simpson's divorce {{hearing on}} 27 October 1936, her solicitor, John Theodore Goddard, became {{concerned}} {{that there would}} be a [...] "patriotic" [...] citizen's intervention (a legal device to block the divorce), and that such an intervention would be successful. The courts could not grant a collaborative divorce (a dissolution of marriage consented to by both parties), and so the case was being handled as if it were an undefended at-fault divorce brought against Ernest Simpson, with Wallis Simpson as the innocent, injured party. The divorce action would fail if the citizen's intervention showed that the Simpsons had colluded by, for example, conniving in or staging the appearance of his adultery so that she could marry someone else. On Monday 7 December 1936, the King heard that Goddard planned to fly to the south of France to see Wallis Simpson. The King summoned him and expressly forbade him to make the journey, fearing that the visit <b>might</b> <b>put</b> doubts in Simpson's mind. Goddard went straight to Downing Street to see Baldwin, as a result of which he was provided with an aeroplane to take him directly to Cannes.|$|E

500|$|Writing for {{the journal}} British Politics, {{academic}} Mark Garnett provided {{a detailed analysis}} of the Blair and Mandelson memoirs, observing that while A Journey gives a more in-depth account of what he termed [...] "contemporary British government", The Third Man is a more satisfying read: [...] "The Third Man was a worthwhile effort for Peter Mandelson's reputation, while Tony Blair has journeyed in vain." [...] The New Zealand Listener, on the other hand, suggested that A Journey and other memoirs written by prominent architects of New Labour had helped to seal its doom after David Miliband – the preferred candidate of all three as Brown's successor – failed to be elected to the position: [...] "All three backed David Miliband, and however much Miliband tried to distance himself – I'm not New Labour, I'm Next Labour – these three books and the publicity that surrounded them showed he had New Labour dye all over his hands. David was beaten to the leadership by his younger brother, Ed (a man who lacked, as Blair himself <b>might</b> <b>put</b> it, the New Labour baggage), by a whisker – just over 1%. And at a stroke, it's clear these great, vocal proselytisers of New Labour have unwittingly written its epitaph." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{aggregate}} site Metacritic, Pandora's Tower {{received a}} score of 73/100 based on 48 critic reviews, denoting [...] "mixed or average" [...] reception. Destructoid's Tony Ponce praised the game's premise and how fleshed out Elena was despite {{her role as a}} damsel in distress, but felt that there was too much background lore, and that Aeron's lack of personality hurt the relationship aspect. Andrew Fitch, writing for Electronic Gaming Monthly, praised the world design, but faulted the lack of character development given to Aeron and Elena. Eurogamer's Matt Edwards referred to the game's plot as [...] "a soppy and yet surprisingly sinister love story", saying that moments between the couple raised a genuine smile. IGN's Chris Schilling said that while the story was [...] "slight", it was bolstered by a good localization and voice acting, in addition to darker elements in the plot and during cutscenes. GameSpot's Ashton Raze praised Aeron and Elena's romance as [...] "a grounded, human [...] in a world of monsters". Heidi Kemps, writing for Joystiq, noted genuine emotion in the relationship mechanics of Aeron and Elema, while Steve Hogarty of Official Nintendo Magazine referred to the scenario as [...] "a boy-meets-girl love story with a Clive Barker twist" [...] in addition to praising its dark tone. The game's time limit mechanic and its impact on Elena's condition divided opinion: some praised its implementation, but some critics noted that it <b>might</b> <b>put</b> too much pressure on the player.|$|E

Powderfinger played their final show at the River Stage in Brisbane on 13 November 2010 in front of 10,000 fans; the last song they performed was [...] "These Days".

The song was available via the band's website with all proceeds going towards the cause. On 8 November 2011, the group released a second compilation album, , containing two new tracks. There was also a 2-disc release, Fingerprints & Footprints – The Ultimate Collection, combining both Fingerprints and Footprints in one set. Also in November, Dino Scatena and the band, published a biography, Footprints: the inside story of Australia's best loved band.
