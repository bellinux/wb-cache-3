40|$|Ongoing {{and future}} imaging surveys {{represent}} {{significant improvements in}} depth, area and seeing compared to current data-sets. These improvements offer the opportunity to discover up to three orders of magnitude more galaxy-galaxy strong lenses than are currently known. In this work we forecast the number of lenses discoverable in forthcoming surveys and simulate their properties. We generate a population of statistically realistic strong lenses and simulate observations of this population for the Dark Energy Survey (DES), Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and Euclid surveys. We verify our model against the galaxy-scale lens search of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS), predicting 250 discoverable lenses compared to 220 found by Gavazzi et al (2014). The predicted Einstein radius distribution is also remarkably similar to that found by Sonnenfeld et al (2013). For future surveys we find that, assuming Poisson limited lens galaxy subtraction, searches in DES, LSST and Euclid datasets should discover 2400, 120000, and 170000 galaxy-galaxy strong lenses respectively. Finders using blue <b>minus</b> <b>red</b> (g-i) difference imaging for lens subtraction can discover 1300 and 62000 lenses in DES and LSST. The uncertainties on the model are dominated by the high redshift source population which typically gives fractional errors on the discoverable lens number at the tens of percent level. We find that doubling the signal-to-noise ratio required for a lens to be detectable, approximately halves the number of detectable lenses in each survey, indicating the importance of understanding the selection function and sensitivity of future lens finders in interpreting strong lens statistics. We make our population forecasting and simulated observation codes publicly available so that the selection function of strong lens finders can easily be calibrated.

30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel color {{modification}} detection method using the variance ratio in the wavelet domain. For a suspicious image, we first decompose the image into four sub-images. The decomposition process is performed in an even-odd manner in the vertical and horizontal directions. Next, we construct four color difference images {{in the form of}} a Bayer CFA pattern: interpolated green <b>minus</b> original <b>red,</b> interpolated green <b>minus</b> interpolated <b>red,</b> interpolated green <b>minus</b> original blue, and interpolated green minus interpolated blue. For the color difference images, we execute a wavelet transform to extract high-frequency components and then use the highest frequency subband to calculate variances. We define a variance ratio measurement to quantify the level of color modification. Through various experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method generates accurate estimation results for detecting color modification. Compared to the conventional method, our method achieves superior results.|$|R

40|$|AbstractGreenness {{identification}} from crop images captured outdoors is {{the important}} step for crop growth monitoring. The commonly used methods for greenness identification are based on visible spectral-index, such as the excess green index, the excess green <b>minus</b> excess <b>red</b> index, the vegetative index, the color index of vegetation extraction, the combined index. All these visible spectral-index based methods {{are working on the}} assumption that plants display a clear high degree of greenness, and soil is the only background element. In fact, the brightness and contrast of an image coming from outdoor environments are seriously affected by the weather conditions and the capture time. The color of the plant varies from dark green to bright green. The back ground elements may contain crop straw, straw ash besides soil. These environmental factors always make the visible spectral-index based methods unable to work correctly. In this paper, an HSV decision tree based method for greenness identification from maize seedling images captured outdoors is proposed. Firstly, the image was converted from RGB color space to HSV color space to avoid influence of illumination. Secondly, most of the background pixels were removed according to their hue values compared with the ones of green plants. Thirdly, the pixels of wheat straws whose hue values were intersected with tender green leaves were eliminated subject to their hues, saturations and values. At last, thresholding was employed to get the green plants. The results indicate that the proposed method can recognize greenness pixels correctly from the crop images captured outdoors...|$|R
