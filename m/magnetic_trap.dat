5000|$|Sputtering sources often employ {{magnetrons}} that utilize strong {{electric and}} magnetic fields to confine charged plasma particles {{close to the}} surface of the sputter target. In a magnetic field, electrons follow helical paths around magnetic field lines, undergoing more ionizing collisions with gaseous neutrals near the target surface than would otherwise occur. (As the target material is depleted, a [...] "racetrack" [...] erosion profile may appear on the surface of the target.) The sputter gas is typically an inert gas such as argon. The extra argon ions created as a result of these collisions lead to a higher deposition rate. The plasma can also be sustained at a lower pressure this way. The sputtered atoms are neutrally charged and so are unaffected by the <b>magnetic</b> <b>trap.</b> Charge build-up on insulating targets can be avoided with the use of RF sputtering where the sign of the anode-cathode bias is varied at a high rate (commonly 13.56 MHz). RF sputtering works well to produce highly insulating oxide films but with the added expense of RF power supplies and impedance matching networks. Stray magnetic fields leaking from ferromagnetic targets also disturb the sputtering process. Specially designed sputter guns with unusually strong permanent magnets must often be used in compensation.|$|E

Exploring, he finds a cage containing two bird-men from Deneb. They tell him that they have been captured by the Great Collector and are part of his menagerie.

Reluctantly, Valérian connects the Arcturian to the device and his body lights up. The magnetic field is deactivated and the specimens flee their cages. They are pursued by the Great Collector - a giant spider-like creature - who manages to kill some of his prey but most manage to get to their ships and blast-off.
