40|$|Aircraft engine {{development}} {{is an expensive}} and time consuming business. The engines have to be designed to withstand loads well above those encountered during normal operating conditions. To meet the certification requirements manufacturers conduct tests where the engines are subjected to extreme conditions and loads. One such extreme condition is fan blade-off (FBO). Using finite element methods (FEM) computational software one can simulate FBO conditions and predict what loads it will inflict on the engine structure. These simulations involve large models that contain many degrees of freedom. As such they are time consuming to create and evaluate. Also they demand a detailed knowledge of the engine geometry to create. In preliminary design studies of engines there exists a need for knowing the loads an engine is subjected to. This provides the design team with valuable information that is used in decisions regarding engine architecture. The aim of this thesis {{is to create a}} scaled-down, simpler model of a turbofan engine, {{that can be used to}} predict bearing and engine <b>mount</b> <b>loads,</b> for a fan blade-off event. In addition the model can be used to estimate or check other parameters like weight and to compare different engine architectures. The turbofan model created was based on rotor dynamics, this model was created in MATLAB and DyRoBeS rotor dynamic simulation software. The simulations were done on three turbofan engines: a reference engine to validate the turbofan model and later applied on two proposal turbofan engines for the coming Next generation Single Aisle (NSA) aircraft. The results for the simulations show that the turbofan model can be used in the conceptual design stage. It can provide the design team with an initial estimate for bearing and engine <b>mount</b> <b>loads.</b> Taking into account the simplicity of the turbofan model, a conclusion on the accuracy of the results is that they are within acceptable limits.

40|$|The {{commonly}} existing {{methods of}} evaluating stress distribution in soils {{rely on the}} use of buried or surface <b>mounted</b> <b>load</b> cells. These measurements are difficult to perform and are limited in their ability to capture the stress variation. A relatively new technology, which makes use of flexible, grid-based, tactile pressure sensors, allows to measure stresses at a large number of points in proximity to one another, hence providing a realistic normal stress distribution. Their thin (0. 1 mm) flexible film overcomes the effect of stiffness variation introduced by rigid load cells and thus allows for measurements that better represent the existing stress conditions. The application of the tactile pressure technology to soils requires adaptation and calibration due to its innovative principle of operation. Examples of work carried out {{over the past ten years}} are provided.
