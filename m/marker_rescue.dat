The amount of <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> with a constant amount of transfecting DNA increases with increasing multiplicities of superinfecting phage up to about 4, and then decreases at higher multiplicities. Host restriction of transfecting DNA does not affect <b>marker</b> <b>rescue.</b> The frequency of wild-type recombinants from <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> {{is much greater than}} that from multiple infection with whole phages, and is comparable to that obtained with two mutant-transfecting DNAs.

40|$|A plasmid <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> {{system based}} on {{restoration}} of the nptII gene was established in Streptococcus gordonii to study the transfer of bacterial and transgenic plant DNA by transformation. In vitro studies revealed that the <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> efficiency depends {{on the type of}} donor DNA. Plasmid and chromosomal DNA of bacteria as well as DNA of transgenic potatoes were transferred with efficiencies ranging from 8. 1 × 10 − 6 to 5. 8 × 10 − 7 transformants per nptII gene. Using a 792 -bp amplification product of nptII the efficiency was strongly decreased (9. 8 × 10 − 9). In blood sausage, <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> using plasmid DNA was detectable (7. 9 × 10 − 10), whereas in milk heat-inactivated horse serum (HHS) had to be added to obtain an efficiency of 2. 7 × 10 − 11. No <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> was detected in extracts of transgenic potatoes despite addition of HHS. In vivo transformation of S. gordonii LTH 5597 was studied in monoassociated rats by using plasmid DNA. No <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> could be detected in vivo, although transformation was detected in the presence of saliva and fecal samples supplemented with HHS. It was also shown that plasmid DNA persists in rat saliva permitting transformation for up to 6 h of incubation. It is suggested that the lack of <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> is due to the absence of competence-stimulating factors such as serum proteins in rat saliva...|$|E
40|$|Several {{attenuated}} {{strains of}} pseudorabies virus contain genomes that carry a deletion in their short unique (Us) component. The sizes of the deletions {{are different in}} the various attenuated strains; the deletions may include {{part of one of}} the inverted repeats as well as part of the Us region of the genome. In most cases, the deletion includes the gene encoding the glycoprotein gI. The attenuated strains with a deletion in their S component have a common history of having been cultivated in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF). We show here that passage of wild-type virus in CEF promotes the emergence of populations of virions with a deletion in their S component. The emergence of these mutants is the result of their growth advantage over the wild type and is related to the lack of expression of gI, as shown by the following. (i) The Norden strain (which has a deletion in the Us) was <b>marker</b> <b>rescued</b> to restore an intact Us. The nonrescued Norden strain had a growth advantage over the rescued Norden strain in CEF. (ii) Passage of wild-type (gI+) virus in CEF but not in rabbit kidney or pig kidney cells resulted invariably in the emergence of virions whose genomes had a deletion in the S component. (iii) Passage of a gI- mutant in CEF did not result in the emergence of such virions. The emergence of virions with a deletion in their S component thus appears to be linked to gI expression. We conclude that gI is deleterious to the growth of pseudorabies virus in CEF and that this effect is cell type specific...|$|R

During the 1970 s the two major constraints to successful commercialisation were identified as slow propagation rate and susceptibility to virus, and work to overcome these was started. Later, more advanced techniques, viz. molecular <b>markers,</b> embryo <b>rescue</b> and in vitro bulb production, were developed. Techniques such as virus elimination, mass propagation, in vitro long-term storage, in vitro bulb formation, embryo rescue and in vitro polyploidisation are being applied on a routine basis to shorten the time required to develop new cultivars, to maintain the propagation scheme and overcome incompatibility between species. More advanced technology gene transfer and marker-assisted hybrid selection, may be applied in future to develop cultivars resistant to virus and to increase efficiency of hybrid selection...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} has been {{developed}} for gene transfer in eukaryotic cells. Chlamydomonas reinhardi, a unicellular eukaryotic alga, was treated with a lethal dose of bleomycin, an agent that induces chromosome breakage. Bleomycin-treated cells were mated with untreated cells, and the mixture was plated onto selective agar medium. The progeny that arose contained the genetic markers from the untreated parent plus {{a subset of the}} genetic markers from the bleomycin-treated parent. Those markers derived from the untreated parent were stable, whereas those recovered from the bleomycin-treated parent were often unstable. Markers closely linked in the bleomycin-treated parent were usually rescued or lost together, whereas distantly linked or unlinked <b>markers</b> were <b>rescued</b> or lost independently. These results suggest that bleomycin treatment of C. reinhardi leads to the formation of chromosome fragments, and fusion of bleomycin-treated cells to untreated cells results in the rescue of some of these fragments. This procedure provides a new means of gene transfer that may be useful for genetic mapping, genetic engineering and for the study of genetic organization...|$|R

In order to define how much the fragments should overlap each other for reliable mapping, we have measured how the frequency of <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> is affected by the position of the chromosomal mutation relative {{to the ends of the}} transferred DNA fragments. For this purpose, we used several DNA fragments to effect <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> in two mutant hybridomas which bear mutations 673 bp apart in the exons encoding the second and third constant region domains of the immunoglobulin mu heavy chain. The frequency of <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> decreased greatly when the mutation was located near one of the ends of the fragments, the results indicating that fragments should be designed to overlap by at least several hundred base pairs.

40|$|The role of {{homology}} between {{donor and recipient}} DNAs in {{the protection}} of transfecting DNA against restriction by competent Bacillus subtilis R cells was studied under <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> conditions with modified helper phage. By comparing restriction under conditions of preinfection <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> and superinfection <b>marker</b> <b>rescue,</b> the significance of DNA homology during {{the initial stages of}} DNA processing by competent cells could be studied. The results showed that both in preinfection and in superinfection, complete protection against restriction of transfectants produced via rescue by the modified homologous helper chromosome occurred. Even up to 90 min after entry, DNA entering the helper-mediated pathway of transfection was not affected by restriction. The significance of these findings is discussed in the general context of the role of DNA homology between donor and recipient on the fate of donor DNA in competent B. subtilis, in particular in relation to the effects on restriction...|$|E
40|$|The {{previous}} {{demonstration that}} a phosphonoacetate (PAA) -resistant (PAAr) vaccinia virus mutant synthesized an altered DNA polymerase provided {{the key to}} mapping this gene. <b>Marker</b> <b>rescue</b> was performed in cells infected with wild-type PAA-sensitive (PAAs) vaccinia by transfecting with calcium phosphate-precipitated DNA from a PAAr mutant virus. Formation of PAAr recombinants was measured by plaque assay {{in the presence of}} PAA. Of the 12 HindIII fragments cloned in plasmid or cosmid vectors, only fragment E conferred the PAAr phenotype. Successive subcloning of the 15 -kilobase HindIII fragment E localized the marker within a 7. 5 -kilobase BamHI-HindIII fragment and then within a 2. 9 -kilobase EcoRI fragment. When the latter was digested with ClaI, <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> was not detected, suggesting that the PAAr mutation mapped near a ClaI site. The sensitive ClaI site was identified by cloning partial ClaI-EcoRI fragments and testing them in the <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> assay. The location of the DNA polymerase gene, about 57 kilobases from the left end of the genome, was confirmed by cell-free translation of mRNA selected by hybridization to plasmids containing regions of PAAr vaccinia DNA active in <b>marker</b> <b>rescue.</b> A 100, 000 -dalton polypeptide that comigrated with authentic DNA polymerase was synthesized.

F. novicida could be transformed with these plasmids either by a chemical transformation method or by electroporation, whereas F. tularensis could be transformed only by electroporation. Transformation of F. tularensis by electroporation was enhanced {{in the absence}} of the capsule. Southern blot analysis showed that the KmR <b>marker</b> was <b>rescued</b> either by integration of the plasmid into the Francisella chromosome or by allelic replacement. Allelic replacement was found to be the mechanism underlying a site-specific mutation affecting FopA, an outer-membrane protein of Francisella. F. novicida could also be transformed with chromosomal DNA carrying the KmR marker and the transformation frequency obtained using chromosomal DNA was generally greater than that obtained using plasmid DNA.

40|$|Glucose {{transporter}} 2 (GLUT 2; gene name SLC 2 A 2) has a {{key role}} in the regulation of glucose dynamics in organs central to metabolism. Although GLUT 2 has been studied in the context of its participation in peripheral and central glucose sensing, its role in the brain is not well understood. To decipher the role of GLUT 2 in brain development, we knocked down slc 2 a 2 (glut 2), the functional ortholog of human GLUT 2, in zebrafish. Abrogation of glut 2 led to defective brain organogenesis, reduced glucose uptake and increased programmed cell death in the brain. Coinciding with the observed localization of glut 2 expression in the zebrafish hindbrain, glut 2 deficiency affected the development of neural progenitor cells expressing the proneural genes atoh 1 b and ptf 1 a but not those expressing neurod. Specificity of the morphant phenotype was demonstrated by the restoration of brain organogenesis, whole-embryo glucose uptake, brain apoptosis, and expression of proneural <b>markers</b> in <b>rescue</b> experiments. These results indicate that glut 2 has an essential role during brain development by facilitating the uptake and availability of glucose and support the involvement of glut 2 in brain glucose sensing...|$|R
40|$|A {{functioning}} {{heart muscle}} is required continuously throughout life. During embryonic development {{the heart muscle}} tissue differentiates from mesoderm that has heart-forming potential. Heart-forming potential in the embryonic mesoderm is regulated by pro-cardiogenic transcription factors, such {{as members of the}} GATA and NK- 2 transcription factor families. Subsequent heart muscle differentiation involves the expression of cytoskeletal proteins, including myosins and troponins. Different Wnt signalling pathways have various functions in heart development. So-called ‘canonical’ (Wnt/β-catenin-mediated) signalling has a conserved role in vertebrate heart development, regulating and restricting heart development and subsequent heart muscle differentiation. Here we investigated the way in which Wnt/β-catenin signalling functionally interacts with the GATA family of pro-cardiogenic transcription factors to regulate subsequent heart muscle differentiation. We used whole Xenopus embryos as an accessible experimental model system for vertebrate heart development. Our experiments confirmed that activation of Wnt signalling results in reduced gata gene expression, as well as reduced gene expression of other pro-cardiogenic transcription factors and heart muscle differentiation markers. Remarkably, we discovered that when GATA function is experimentally restored, the expression of other pro-cardiogenic transcription factors and heart muscle differentiation <b>markers</b> is <b>rescued.</b> These findings, obtained from whole-embryo experiments, show that Wnt signalling regulates heart development at the level of GATA factors, confirming earlier results from tissue-culture experiments. Furthermore, our rescue experiments in Xenopus embryos revealed differences in functional activity between the various GATA transcription factors involved in heart development. We discovered that GATA 4 is more efficient at reinstating the gene expression of other pro-cardiogenic transcription factors, whereas GATA 6 is more potent at promoting the expression of genes associated with terminal heart muscle differentiation. In conclusion, our findings show that the inhibition of heart development by Wnt/β-catenin signalling during organogenesis is mediated by the loss of expression of GATA pro-cardiogenic transcription factors and reveal functional differences between those GATA factors in heart development...|$|R
40|$|<b>Marker</b> <b>rescue,</b> the {{restoration}} of gene function by replacement of a defective gene with a normal one by recombination, has been utilized to produce novel adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. AAV serotype 2 (AAV 2) clones containing wild-type terminal repeats, an intact rep gene, and a mutated cap gene, served as the template for <b>marker</b> <b>rescue.</b> When transfected alone in 293 cells, these AAV 2 mutant plasmids produced noninfectious AAV virions that could not bind heparin sulfate after infection with adenovirus dl 309 helper virus. However, the mutation in the cap gene was corrected after cotransfection with AAV serotype 3 (AAV 3) capsid DNA fragments, resulting {{in the production of}} AAV 2 /AAV 3 chimeric viruses. The cap genes from several independent <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> experiments were PCR amplified, cloned, and then sequenced. Sequencing results confirmed not only that homologous recombination occurred but, more importantly, that a mixed population of AAV chimeras carrying 16 to 2, 200 bp throughout different regions of the type 3 cap gene were generated in a single <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> experiment. A 100 % correlation was observed between infectivity and the ability of the chimeric virus to bind heparin sulfate. In addition, many of the AAV 2 /AAV 3 chimeras examined exhibited differences at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels, suggesting that these chimeras may also exhibit unique infectious properties. Furthermore, AAV helper plasmids containing these chimeric cap genes were able to function in the triple transfection method to generate recombinant AAV. Together, the results suggest that DNA from other AAV serotypes can rescue AAV capsid mutants and that <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> may be a powerful, yet simple, technique to map, as well as develop, chimeric AAV capsids that display different serotype-specific properties...|$|E

Plasmids pDPT 51 and pDPT 55 were constructed to mediate the intergeneric mobilization of pBR 322 derivatives, and a mutant of R. capsulata with improved intergeneric recipient activity was isolated. Four previously unmapped genes affecting bacteriochlorophyll synthesis and two genes affecting photochemical reaction center synthesis have been located by <b>marker</b> <b>rescue.</b> Some of the fragments of R. capsulata DNA are capable of vector-independent complementation, implying that promoters are located on these fragments. Other fragments complement only in one orientation of insertion in the vector, implying transcription from promotors on the vectors and thereby fixing the direction of transcription for those fragments. Still other fragments of DNA show rescue only via recombination between homologous plasmid-borne DNA fragments and chromosomal mutations.

40|$|AbstractThe vacuolated lens (vl) mouse {{mutation}} arose on the C 3 H/HeSnJ {{background and}} results in lethality, neural tube defects (NTDs) and cataracts. The vl phenotypes are due to a deletion/frameshift mutation in the orphan GPCR, Gpr 161. A recent study using a null allele demonstrated that Gpr 161 functions in primary cilia and represses the Shh pathway. We show the hypomorphic Gpr 161 vl allele does not severely affect the Shh pathway. To identify additional pathways regulated by Gpr 161 during neurulation, we took advantage of naturally occurring genetic variation in the mouse. Previously Gpr 161 vl-C 3 H was crossed to different inbred backgrounds including MOLF/EiJ and the Gpr 161 vl mutant phenotypes were rescued. Five modifiers were mapped (Modvl: Modifier of vl) including Modvl 5 MOLF. In this study we demonstrate the Modvl 5 MOLF congenic rescues the Gpr 161 vl-associated lethality and NTDs but not cataracts. Bioinformatics determined the transcription factor, Cdx 1, is the only annotated gene within the Modvl 5 95 % CI co-expressed with Gpr 161 during neurulation and not expressed in the eye. Using Cdx 1 as an entry point, we identified the retinoid acid (RA) and canonical Wnt pathways as downstream targets of Gpr 161. QRT-PCR, ISH and IHC determined that expression of RA and Wnt genes are down-regulated in Gpr 161 vl/vl but rescued by the Modvl 5 MOLF congenic during neurulation. Intraperitoneal RA injection restores expression of canonical Wnt <b>markers</b> and <b>rescues</b> Gpr 161 vl/vl NTDs. These results establish the RA and canonical Wnt as pathways downstream of Gpr 161 during neurulation, and suggest that Modvl 5 MOLF bypasses the Gpr 161 vl mutation by restoring the activity of these pathways...|$|R

Infectious prophage DNA entered competent cells as a single molecule; it gave a majority of lytic responses. Single markers in sheared prophage DNA were inactivated {{at the same rate}} as markers in mature DNA. Prophage DNA was dependent on the bacterial rec- 1 function for its infectivity, whereas vegetative DNA was not. The mechanism of transfection of B. subtilis with viral DNA is discussed, and a model for transfection with φ 105 DNA is proposed...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of the proamniotic cavity in the mammalian embryo is the earliest of many instances throughout development in which programmed cell death and the {{formation of}} epithelia play fundamental roles (Coucouvanis, E., and G. R. Martin. 1995. Cell. 83 : 279 – 287). To determine the role of the basement membrane (BM) in cavitation, we use embryoid bodies derived from mouse embryonic stem cells in which the LAMC 1 genes have been inactivated to prevent BM deposition (Smyth, N., H. S. Vatansever, P. Murray, M. Meyer, C. Frie, M. Paulsson, and D. Edgar. 1999. J. Cell Biol. 144 : 151 – 610). We demonstrate here that LAMC 1 −/− embryoid bodies are unable to cavitate, and do not form an epiblast epithelium {{in the absence of a}} BM, although both embryonic ectodermal cells and extraembryonic endodermal cells do differentiate, as evidenced by the expression of cell-specific <b>markers.</b> Acceleration or <b>rescue</b> of BM deposition by exogenous laminin in wild-type or LAMC 1 −/− embryoid bodies, respectively, results in cavitation that is temporally and spatially associated with restoration of epiblast epithelial development.

The M 2 gene product of γHV 68 is a latency-associated antigen with no discernible homology to any known proteins. Here {{we focus on the}} requirement for the M 2 gene in splenic B-cell latency. Our analyses showed the following. (i) Low-dose (100 PFU) inoculation administered via the intranasal route resulted in a failure to establish splenic B-cell latency at day 16 postinfection. (ii) Increasing the inoculation dose to 4 × 105 PFU administered via the intranasal route partially restored the establishment of B-cell latency at day 16, but no virus reactivation was detected upon explant into tissue cultures. (iii) Although previous data failed to detect a phenotype of the M 2 mutant upon high-dose intraperitoneal inoculation, decreasing the inoculation dose to 100 PFU administered intraperitoneally revealed a splenic B-cell latency phenotype at day 16 that was very similar to the phenotype observed upon high-dose intranasal inoculation. (iv) After low-dose intraperitoneal inoculation, fractionated B-cell populations showed that the M 2 mutant virus was able to establish latency in surface immunoglobulin D-negative (sIgD−) B cells; by 6 months postinfection, equivalent frequencies of M 2 mutant and <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> viral genome-positive sIgD− B cells were detected. (v) Like the <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> virus, the M 2 mutant virus also established latency in splenic naive B cells upon low-dose intraperitoneal inoculation, but there was a significant lag in the decay of this latently infected reservoir compared to that seen with the <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> virus. (vi) After low-dose intranasal inoculation, by day 42 postinfection, latency was observed in the spleen, although at a frequency significantly lower than that in the <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> virus-infected mice; by 3 months postinfection, nearly equivalent levels of viral genome-positive cells were observed in the spleens of <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> virus- and M 2 mutant virus-infected mice, and these cells were exclusively sIgD− B cells. Taken together, these data convincingly demonstrate a role for the M 2 gene product in reactivation from splenic B cells and also suggest that disruption of the M 2 gene leads to dose- and route-specific defects in the efficient establishment of splenic B-cell latency...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{requirement for}} the use of retroviral vectors in human gene transfer experiments is the avoidance of human exposure to replication-competent (helper) retroviruses. To meet this requirement, we used a sensitive <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> assay for helper virus to screen vector-transduced cells prior to reinfusion into patients. This assay utilized Mus dunni cells harboring a retroviral vector that can be rescued by helper retroviruses. The assay indicated the presence of helper virus in medium exposed to hematopoietic cells from all patients tested, including six patients with various cancers and one patient with Gaucher's disease, whether or not the patient cells had been exposed to retroviral vectors. All of the helper viruses were in a single interference group. We have now shown that treatment of the M. dunni <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> assay cells with 5 -iodo- 2 '-deoxyuridine or hydrocortisone can activate production of an apparently identical helper virus, which we have named M. dunni endogenous virus (MDEV). Thus, production of virus in the assays of patient materials was likely due to exposure of the <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> assay cells to the hydrocortisone present in the hematopoietic cell growth medium. MDEV does not belong to any of the known murine leukemia virus groups by interference analysis, and we have called the new group multitropic because of the wide range of cells from different species that MDEV can infect...|$|E
40|$|Advancing age is {{the major}} risk factor for {{cardiovascular}} diseases (CVD), primarily because aging results {{in the development of}} vascular endothelial dysfunction and stiffening of large elastic arteries. Both vascular endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffening are associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammation, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Autophagy, the cellular process of degrading damaged macromolecules/organelles, inhibits oxidative stress and inflammation. Thus, the goal of this dissertation was to determine the role of autophagy in age-related vascular endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffening, and to establish the efficacy of autophagy-enhancing interventions for restoring/improving function. In arteries of older humans and mice, expression of autophagy markers was impaired by ~ 40 % and was associated with vascular endothelial dysfunction, indicated by an ~ 25 % reduction in endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD). Impaired EDD was mediated by reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, and was associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammation. In old mice, treatment with the autophagy-enhancing agent trehalose restored expression of autophagy <b>markers</b> and <b>rescued</b> NO-mediated EDD by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. In cultured endothelial cells, autophagy inhibition increased oxidative stress and reduced NO, whereas trehalose enhanced NO via an autophagy- dependent mechanism. In mice, aging was also associated with impaired expression of mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) mediators, greater activation of the mitochondrial redox/dysfunction sensor p 66 shc and increased arterial stiffness, indicated by ~ 25 % higher aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV). Trehalose restored mitophagy mediators, reduced p 66 shc activation and normalized aPWV in old mice. In aortic rings studied in vitro, mitochondrial dysfunction increased p 66 shc activation and mechanical stiffness; co-incubation with trehalose prevented these effects. The autophagy-enhancer spermidine had similar effects on aPWV and EDD with aging. In old mice, spermidine supplementation normalized aPWV, restored NO- mediated EDD and reduced indices of arterial oxidative stress, including superoxide production and nitrotyrosine levels. These effects of spermidine were associated with enhanced arterial expression of autophagy markers. Collectively, these results indicate that autophagy is impaired with aging in vascular tissues. These findings also suggest that autophagy/mitophagy preserves vascular endothelial function and prevents arterial stiffening with age. Autophagy- enhancing strategies may therefore have therapeutic efficacy for ameliorating age- associated arterial dysfunction and preventing CVD...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{methylation}} and histone methylation are two key epigenetic modifications {{that help}} govern heterochromatin dynamics. The roles for these chromatin-modifying activities in directing tissue-specific development remain largely unknown. To address this issue, {{we examined the}} roles of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt 1) and the H 3 K 9 histone methyltransferase Suv 39 h 1 in zebra fish development. Knockdown of Dnmt 1 in zebra fish embryos caused defects in terminal differentiation of the intestine, exocrine pancreas, and retina. Interestingly, not all tissues required Dnmt 1, as differentiation of the liver and endocrine pancreas appeared normal. Proper differentiation depended on Dnmt 1 catalytic activity, as Dnmt 1 morphants could be rescued by active zebra fish or human DNMT 1 but not by catalytically inactive derivatives. Dnmt 1 morphants exhibited dramatic reductions of both genomic cytosine methylation and genome-wide H 3 K 9 trimethyl levels, leading us to investigate the overlap of in vivo functions of Dnmt 1 and Suv 39 h 1. Embryos lacking Suv 39 h 1 had organ-specific terminal differentiation defects that produced largely phenocopies of Dnmt 1 morphants but retained wild-type levels of DNA methylation. Remarkably, suv 39 h 1 overexpression <b>rescued</b> <b>markers</b> of terminal differentiation in Dnmt 1 morphants. Our results suggest that Dnmt 1 activity helps direct histone methylation by Suv 39 h 1 and that, together, Dnmt 1 and Suv 39 h 1 help guide the terminal differentiation of particular tissues...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of prostate cancer-related deaths {{are due to}} metastatic progression, {{a process that is}} poorly understood. Active Stat 5 a/b predicts early disease recurrence in clinical prostate cancer, which typically manifests as development of metastatic disease. The focus of this thesis was to investigate the significance and underlying mechanisms of active Jak 2 -Stat 5 a/b signaling in metastatic dissemination of prostate cancer. The work presented here provides mechanistic evidence that active Stat 5 a/b promotes Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) of prostate cancer cells as indicated by increased Twist 1, N-cadherin, vimentin, and fibronectin expression, while E-cadherin levels were down-regulated. Inhibition of Jak 2 -Stat 5 a/b signaling suppressed the molecular changes associated with active Stat 5 a/b-induced EMT in prostate cancer cells, in prostate cancer xenograft tumors, and patient-derived clinical prostate cancers. Induction of Jak 2 -Stat 5 a/b signaling disrupted epithelial monolayer of prostate cancer cells while inducing migration and adhesion of prostate cells to fibronectin. Furthermore, the work presented here demonstrates that transcription factor Twist 1 is a mediator of prostate cancer EMT induced by Jak 2 -Stat 5 a/b. Specifically, Twist 1 knockdown blocked functional endpoints of EMT induced by Jak 2 -Stat 5 a/b and suppressed Jak 2 -Stat 5 a/b-induced changes in the expression of EMT <b>markers</b> which was <b>rescued</b> by re-introduction of Twist 1. Unexpectedly, while promoting EMT, Jak 2 -Stat 5 a/b signaling induced stem-like properties in prostate cancer cells including sphere formation and expression of stemness markers such as BMI 1. Mechanistically, both Twist 1 and BMI 1 were critical for Stat 5 a/b induction of stem-like features as genetic knockdown of Twist 1 suppressed Stat 5 a/b-induced BMI 1 expression and sphere formation in stem cell culture conditions, which was rescued by re-introduction of BMI 1. Using human prolactin knock-in mice, we demonstrate that Jak 2 -Stat 5 a/b signaling promoted metastases formation of prostate cancer cells in vivo. Collectively, this work implicates that active Jak 2 -Stat 5 a/b promotes metastatic dissemination of prostate cancer by inducing EMT and stem-like properties of prostate cancer cells. ...|$|R
40|$|Recombination {{hotspots}} {{have previously}} {{been discovered in}} bacteriophage T 4 by two different approaches, <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> recombination from heavily damaged phage genomes and recombination during co-infection by two undamaged phage genomes. The phage replication origin ori(34) {{is located in a}} region that has a hotspot in both assays. To determine the relationship between the origin and the two kinds of hotspots, we generated phage carrying point mutations that should inactivate ori(34) but not affect the gene 34 reading frame (within which ori(34) is located). The mutations eliminated the function of the origin, as judged by both autonomous replication of plasmids during T 4 infection and two-dimensional gel analysis of phage genomic replication intermediates. As expected from past studies, the ori(34) mutations also eliminated the hotspot for <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> recombination from UV-irradiated genomes. However, the origin mutations had no effect on the recombination hotspot that is observed with co-infecting undamaged phage genomes, demonstrating that some DNA sequence other than the origin is responsible for inflated recombination between undamaged genomes. The hotspots for <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> recombination may result from a replication fork restart process that acts upon origin-initiated replication forks that become blocked at nearby DNA damage. The two-dimensional gel analysis also revealed phage T 4 replication intermediates not previously detected by this method, including origin theta forms...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} used the cottontail rabbit {{papillomavirus}} DNA-rabbit system {{to evaluate whether}} the regulatory genes E 1 and E 2 and the transforming gene E 6 are required for papilloma formation. Frameshift mutations were generated in the individual genes {{in the context of}} a full-length cottontail rabbit papillomavirus genome, and the mutant DNAs were intradermally inoculated into domestic rabbits. None of the mutants induced papillomas. <b>Marker</b> <b>rescue</b> experiments confirmed that the defects were due to mutations that we deliberately introduced. <b>Marker</b> <b>rescue</b> also confirmed our previous report that the upstream region of E 7 around position 9 was critical for papilloma induction. These results demonstrate that the E 1 and E 2 regulatory genes as well as the E 6 and E 7 transforming genes are each required for papilloma formation. Each gene may provide molecular targets for therapeutic intervention...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{reported}} here show that some UV-irradiated wild-type T 7 phage markers can be rescued efficiently by coinfection with T 7 amber mutant phage in a permissive host. Other {{results show that}} the segments of a UV-irradiated genome that replicate efficiently are those that also are rescued efficiently during a <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> experiment. At higher doses, fewer markers are rescued efficiently and fewer segments of the genome replicate efficiently. The results clearly indicate that the probability of <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> is correlated with the ability of the DNA containing the marker to replicate. Sucrose density gradient analysis shows that UV irradiation does not produce double-strand scissions in T 7 DNA at doses used here. Therefore, the partial replication and rescue of markers from the left end of the genome is not due simply to injection of only the left end of the T 7 DNA...|$|E
40|$|Abstract During {{embryonic}} development many structures {{crucial for}} breathing and eating {{arise from the}} pharyngeal and anterior foregut epithelium (FGE), which contains the oral ectoderm and the foregut endoderm. Proper differentiation and signaling within and from this epithelial tissue {{is necessary for the}} development of the mandible, the esophagus, and the trachea. Many birth defects occur in these structures that greatly disrupt the ability of affected infants to breathe and eat. This dissertation investigates the importance of the pharyngeal and anterior FGE in mandible and foregut development. The most rostral portion of the pharyngeal epithelium contributes to the development of the mandible. At embryonic day 10. 5 the mandible is a bud structure, composed of neural crest-derived mesenchyme and core mesoderm surrounded by pharyngeal epithelium. The mesenchyme needs to receive Hedgehog signaling for mandible development, but the epithelial tissue that signals to the mesenchyme has not been identified in mammals. Data presented in Chapter 2 show that Sonic Hedgehog is necessary at two distinct stages of mandible development by using a tissue specific genetic ablation to remove Sonic Hedgehog from the pharyngeal endoderm. First, we show that Sonic Hedgehog promotes cell survival prior to cartilage differentiation through immunostaining for Caspase- 9, an apoptosis <b>marker.</b> Second, a <b>rescue</b> of early cell death with the p 53 inhibitor pifithrin-&# 945; shows that Sonic Hedgehog is necessary for cartilage condensation and differentiation later in development. Without cartilage differentiation the mandible is unable to elongate properly and hypoplasia occurs. Caudal to the pharyngeal epithelium is the anterior FGE, which develops into the larynx, esophagus and trachea. The anterior FGE is a single endodermal tube at E 9. 5 and by E 11. 5 compartmentalizes into two distinct tubes: the esophagus and trachea. While the signaling pathways involved in proper compartmentalization of the foregut are well studied, nothing is known about the cellular behaviors that drive this complex event. One important event during foregut compartmentalization is the establishment of dorso-ventral patterning, which is necessary for separation to occur. To elucidate the importance of dorso-ventral patterning, we take advantage of two genetic mouse models with disrupted patterning, an activation of and a removal of &# 946;-catenin in the ventral foregut endoderm. Data presented in Chapter 3 show that &# 946;-catenin is important for epithelial pseudostratification and the establishment of a region of double-positive cells at the dorso-ventral midline through close examination of epithelial morphogenesis at E 10. 5 prior to compartmentalization. This data has established two mouse models for studying changes in epithelial morphology during foregut compartmentalization. In total, this body of work details how signals originating in the pharyngeal and anterior foregut epithelium regulate both mesenchymal and epithelial behaviors during mandible and foregut development.

The mutations were then transferred to the viral genome by genetic recombination during cotransfection of rabbit kidney cells with the mutagenized fragments and intact HSV- 1 DNA. The HpaI restriction enzyme fragments LD, B, LG, I, and J were mutagenized. Temperature-sensitive mutants were found at frequencies of 1 to 5 % among the progeny of the transfections. Syncytial mutants also were found at high frequency when fragment B or LD was used for mutagenesis. Fifteen of these mutants, 11 temperature sensitive and 4 syncytial, were used for further studies, including complementation analysis, DNA synthesis, and <b>marker</b> <b>rescue.</b> <b>Marker</b> <b>rescue</b> data presented here and in the accompanying publication (A.

40|$|Cowpox virus, in {{contrast}} to vaccinia virus, can multiply in Chinese hamster ovary cells. To study the genetic basis for this difference in host range, recombinants between vaccinia and cowpox viruses were isolated and their DNA restriction patterns were examined. The ability to multiply in Chinese hamster ovary cells could be correlated with the conservation of cowpox virus sequences mapping at the left end of the genome. This was further demonstrated by <b>marker</b> <b>rescue</b> of the host range phenotype with restricted cowpox virus DNA. <b>Marker</b> <b>rescue</b> with cloned restriction fragments of decreasing size enabled the fine localization of the host range function to a 2. 3 -kilobase-pair fragment. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that the fragment encoded a single major polypeptide of approximately 77, 000 daltons.
