40|$|Abstract Background Trauma {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the experience of many patients with substance use disorder, but is relatively under-studied particularly in Australia. The present survey examined the lifetime prevalence of various forms of trauma including driving careers in the context of relevant medical conditions. Methods A survey was undertaken in a family medicine practice with a special interest in addiction medicine in Brisbane, Australia. Results Of 350 patients surveyed, 220 were substance dependent, and 130 were general <b>medical</b> patients. <b>Addicted</b> patients were younger (mean ± S. D. 33. 72 ± 8. 14 vs. 44. 24 ± 16. 91 years, P Conclusion This study shows that despite shorter driving histories, addicted patients have worse driving careers and general trauma experience than the comparison group which is not explained by associated medical conditions. Trauma is relevant to addiction management at both the patient and policy levels. Substance dependence policies which focus largely on prevention of virus transmission likely have too narrow a public health focus, and tend to engender an unrealistically simplistic and trivialized view of the addiction syndrome. Reduction of drug driving and drug related trauma likely require policies which reduce drug use per se, and are not limited to harm reduction measures alone. </p...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Continuity of {{care for}} {{long-term}} service-dependent patients in the public mental health system requires intensive collaboration between all agencies involved. Understanding {{the ways in which}} various aspects of continuity of care interact may reveal help {{to find out more about}} how care de­livered over time improves outcomes. C ase study: Based on <b>medical</b> records, an <b>addicted</b> couple was monitored for number and type of contacts with health and social services. Over the years, 81 social workers or nurses, spread over 25 health and social services, have been involved in the rehabilitation process. Breakdown of continuity of care is linked to lack of information, missing procedures and guidelines, fragile relationships with the patient, and a reluctant public health approach. Conclu sion: Prominent among relevant factors is the absence of protocols governing the transfer of patients between the various links in the continuum of mental healthcare services. High-quality follow-up after admission is partly a matter of professional principle in ensuring that problems in the chain of services are discussed. Case presen­tation in psychiatric journals should give syste­matic at­ten­tion to sources of error in continuity of mental health­care. </p...|$|R
40|$|Study {{examined}} 27 {{reports from}} disciplinary tribunals against medical practitioners who abused narcotic analgesics (often {{combined with other}} drugs of addiction) between 2010 and 2015. The study covered all States and Territories except Tasmania (no reports were accessible for this jurisdiction. The reports revealed that 12 medical practitioners were in their 40 s; five in their 30 s; and one person still in the 20 s. Although majority were General Practitioners (15 out of 27), other medical specialties were also represented. Self-administered Pethidine was the most prevalent opioid (11 out of 27), and was the only drug used alone. Morphine was self-administered by six doctors; the same number used high doses of Panadeine Forte, Codeine and Codeine Phosphate, and Fentanyl was abused by five doctors. Surprisingly, fewer medical practitioners appear to use such opiates such as Propofol, Tramadol and Tramol, Oxycodone and Endone. The examination of cases suggests lack of consistency in the imposition of professional sanctions and penalties by the relevant tribunals. The study concludes that disciplinary tribunals should apply the test of proportionality {{in the form of}} ‘reasonable necessity’ when deciding whether to remove or suspend the <b>addicted</b> <b>medical</b> practitioner from the Register...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Use of {{smokeless}} tobacco {{is common in}} South Asia. Tobacco is a major preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. Doctors make {{one of the best}} avenues to influence patients' tobacco use. However, <b>medical</b> students <b>addicted</b> to tobacco are likely to retain this habit as physicians and are unlikely to counsel patients against using tobacco. With this background, this study was conducted with the objective of determining the prevalence of {{smokeless tobacco}} among Pakistani medical students. Methods A cross sectional study was carried out in three medical colleges of Pakistan – one from the north and two from the southern region. 1025 students selected by convenient sampling completed a peer reviewed, pre-tested, self-administered questionnaire. Questions were asked regarding lifetime use (at least once or twice in their life), current use (at least once is the last 30 days), and established use (more than 100 times in their life) of smokeless tobacco. Chi square and logistic regression analyses were used. Results Two hundred and twenty (21. 5 %) students had used tobacco in some form (smoked or smokeless) in their lifetime. Sixty six (6. 4 %) students were lifetime users of smokeless tobacco. Thirteen (1. 3 %) were daily users while 18 (1. 8 %) fulfilled the criterion for established users. Niswar was the most commonly used form of smokeless tobacco followed by paan and nass. Most naswar users belonged to NWFP while most paan users studied in Karachi. On univariate analysis, lifetime use of smokeless tobacco showed significant associations with the use of cigarettes, student gender (M > F), student residence (boarders > day scholars) and location of the College (NWFP > Karachi). Multivariate analysis showed independent association of lifetime use of smokeless tobacco with concomitant cigarette smoking, student gender and location of the medical college. Conclusion The use of smokeless tobacco among medical students cannot be ignored. The governments should add the goal of eliminating smokeless tobacco to existing drives against cigarette smoking. Drives in Karachi should focus more on eliminating paan usage while those in NWFP should focus more on the use of naswar. Medical colleges should provide greater education about the myths and hazards of smokeless tobacco. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} use of internet has caused new psychological, social, and educational problems for the students. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the quality of life in medical students who suffer from internet addiction. This cross-sectional survey was carried out in Tehran University of Medical Sciences, and a total of 174 fourth-to seventh-year undergraduate medical students were enrolled. The quality of life was assessed by WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire which covers four domains of physical health, psychological, social relationships, and the environment. For assessing internet addiction, we used Internet Addiction Test (IAT) of Young. The students with IAT score higher than 50 were considered as addicted. For evaluating academic performance, the students were requested to report their grade point average (GPA). The mean IA score (±SD) was 34. 13 ± 12. 76. Twenty-eight students (16. 90 %) had IAT score above 50. The mean quality of life score in internet addicted group was 54. 97 ± 11. 38 versus 61. 65 ± 11. 21 in normal group (P = 0. 005). Furthermore, there was a negative correlation between IA score and physical domain (r=- 0. 18, P = 0. 02); psychological domain (r=- 0. 35, P = 0. 000); and social relation domain (r=- 0. 26, P = 0. 001). Mean GPA was significantly lower in the addicted group. It seems that quality of life is lower in the internet <b>addicted</b> <b>medical</b> students; moreover, such students academically perform poorer in comparison with non-addicts. Since internet addiction is increasing at a rapid pace which may provoke considerable academic, psychological and social implications; as a result, it may require screening programs to the immediate finding of such problem to give consultations to prevent unwanted complications...|$|R
