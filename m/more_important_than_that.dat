25|$|The {{historians are}} also not {{unanimous}} about {{who led the}} missions to Rome and Constantinople. According to Yordan Ivanov the second mission was led by Sondoke, while Venedikov suggests it was Stazis. According to Gyuzelev the leading person in the Bulgarian delegation was Peter which was made clear during the Council of Constantinople. He emphasizes that according {{to the story of}} Anastasius Bibliothecarius the gifts to the Roman legates were sent through Peter. Peter is the person of the Bulgarian delegation in Constantinople who spoke at the Council. Gyuzelev also pays attention to the letters of Pope John VIII. Letters were sent to Boris I (16 April 878 and May 879), to Doks— brother of Boris I (April 878), to Peter (16 April 878) and to high ranking boils including Peter (in the letter of May 879). In the letter of April 878 addressed personally to Peter the Pope called him comita (Petrum comitem). It has been suggested that under comita the Pope did not mean a regional governor but comes palatii, i. e. the first person in the court of the ruler. Gyuzelev concludes that Peter's role in the events between 866 and 879 is <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of the ichirgu-boil Stazis and therefore Peter must have been kavhan at least during that period.|$|E
500|$|Warhol clearly {{changed the}} concept of art appreciation. Instead of {{harmonious}} three-dimensional arrangements of objects, he chose mechanical derivatives of commercial illustration {{with an emphasis on}} the packaging. His variations of multiple soup cans, for example, made the process of repetition an appreciated technique: [...] "If you take a Campbell's Soup can and repeat it fifty times, you are not interested in the retinal image. According to Marcel Duchamp, what interests you is the concept that wants to put fifty Campbell's Soup cans on a canvas." [...] The regimented multiple can depictions almost become an abstraction whose details are less important than the panorama. In a sense, the representation was <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> which was represented. Warhol's interest in machinelike creation during his early pop art days was misunderstood by those in the art world, whose value system was threatened by mechanization.|$|E

[...] Eystein was particularly active in Bergen, and {{his role in the}} development of the city was probably <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of King Olaf Kyrre, the founder of the city according to the sagas. He moved the royal seat in the city from Alrekstad to Holmen on the eastern shore of Vågen, in the city core, thereby rationalising the bureaucracy. At Holmen, he built a Church of the Apostles (probably a stave church) and a St. Nicholas Church, as well as a royal palace which according to Snorri Sturluson was the most imposing wooden building ever raised in Norway (although Theodoric the Monk who wrote earlier already noted it was [...] "now almost collapsed from excessive age"). He also built a St. Michael's Church and founded the Benedictine abbey Munkeliv Abbey at Nordnes, and the tithe to the church was introduced during the reign of Eystein and Sigurd.|$|E

[...] At least 150 people regularly attended the church, but its income was modest and priests frequently moved on to richer parishes. [...] The building fell into disrepair in the 17th and 18th centuries, although the four cracked bells in the tower were replaced by London bell-founder Thomas Lester in 1742.

2500|$|The Santa Cruz ("Holy Cross") name did not {{disappear}} altogether. In the 1527 {{map of the}} Visconte Maggiolo it re-appears in the dual label Terre Sante Crusis de lo Brasil e del Portugal ("Land of the Holy Cross of Brazil and of Portugal"). Years later, in 1552, the chronicler João de Barros grumbled at the change in name. [...] Barros notes how, before leaving in 1500, Pedro Álvares Cabral erected a huge wooden cross as the marker of the land, but that later, because brazilwood was brought from this land, [...] "this name (Brazil) became stuck {{in the mouth of}} the people, and the name Santa Cruz was lost, as if the name of some wood which tinctured cloths was <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> wood which has tinctured all the Sacraments by which we were saved, by the blood of Jesus Christ, which was spilled upon it." [...] Barros goes on to moan that he can do little but remind his readers of the solemnity of the original name and urge them to use it lest, on Judgment Day, [...] "they be accused of being worshipers of brazilwood" [...] rather than worshipers of the Holy Cross. [...] "For the honor of such a great land let us call it a province, and say the 'Province of Holy Cross', which sounds better among the prudent than 'Brazil', which was placed vulgarly without consideration and is an unfit name for these properties of the royal crown." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{was never}} any {{consensus}} on what actually constituted Satanic ritual abuse. This lack of a single definition, as well as confusion between the meanings of the term [...] "ritual" [...] (religious versus psychological) allowed {{a wide range of}} allegations and evidence to be claimed as a demonstration of the reality of SRA claims, irrespective of which [...] "definition" [...] the evidence supported. Acrimonious disagreements between groups who supported SRA allegations as authentic and those criticizing them as unsubstantiated resulted in an extremely polarized discussion with little middle ground. The lack of credible evidence for the more extreme interpretations often being seen as evidence of an effective conspiracy rather than an indication that the allegations are unfounded. The atheistic or religious beliefs of the disputants have also resulted in different interpretations of evidence, and as well as accusations of those who reject the claims being [...] "anti-child". Both believers and skeptics have developed networks to disseminate information on their respective positions. One of the central themes of the discussion among English child abuse professionals was the assertion that people should simply [...] "believe the children", and that the testimony of children was sufficient proof, which ignored the fact that in many cases the testimony of children was interpreted by professionals rather than the children explicitly disclosing allegations of abuse. In some cases this was simultaneously presented with the idea that it did not matter if SRA actually existed, that the empirical truth of SRA was irrelevant, that the testimony of children was <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of doctors, social workers and the criminal justice system.|$|E

2500|$|Norman Sanders {{calls the}} play [...] "almost a {{complete}} anthology of {{the practices of}} the doctrine of romantic love which inspired the poetic and prose Romances of the period." [...] At the very centre of this is the contest between love and friendship; [...] "an essential part of the comicality of The Two Gentlemen of Verona is created by the necessary conflict between highly stylised concepts of love and friendship." [...] This is manifested in {{the question of whether the}} relationship between two male friends is <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> between lovers, encapsulated by Proteus' rhetorical question at 5.4.54; [...] "In love/Who respects friend?" [...] This question [...] "exposes the raw nerve at the heart of the central relationships, the dark reality lurking beneath the wit and lyricism with which the play has in general presented lovers' behaviour." [...] In the program notes for John Barton's 1981 RSC production at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Anne Barton, his wife, wrote that the central theme of the play was [...] "how to bring love and friendship into a constructive and mutually enhancing relationship." [...] As William C. Carroll points out, this is a common theme in Renaissance literature, which often celebrates friendship as the more important relationship (because it is pure and unconcerned with sexual attraction), and contends that love and friendship cannot co-exist. As actor Alex Avery argues, [...] "The love between two men is a greater love for some reason. There seems to be a sense that the function of a male/female relationship is purely for the family and to procreate, to have a family. But a love between two men is something that you choose. You have arranged marriages, [...] a friendship between two men is created by the desires and wills of those two men, whereas a relationship between a man and a girl is actually constructed completely peripheral to whatever the feelings of the said boy and girl are." ...|$|E
