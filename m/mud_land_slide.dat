On February 18, 2017, shifting earth damaged a pier supporting the Pfeiffer Canyon Bridge north of Esalen and forced CalTrans to close Highway 1. CalTrans determined that the bridge was damaged beyond repair and announced an accelerated project to replace the bridge by September. Following closure of the bridge, Esalen was cut off, and resorted to evacuating dozens of guests by helicopter. A landslide at Mud Creek south of the hot springs severely restricted vehicle access to the resort, and Esalen temporarily closed its doors. Then, on May 20, 2017, a new slide at Mud Creek closed Highway 1 for at least a year.|$|R

40|$|With the Eurasia supercontinent at her {{west and}} the Pacific Ocean at east, Taiwan is {{in one of the}} most {{prevalent}} monsoon areas. Monsoons or typhoons bring along heavy precipitation that produce great threat of <b>mud</b> <b>slide</b> and <b>land</b> <b>slide</b> in the mountains. Remote sensing satellites have been developed into a powerful environment monitoring tool for the countries with space access capability. Potential disasters occurring in remote mountain areas can only rely on satellite monitoring to provide in-time early warning information before, during, and after heavy rain. Microwave remote sensing satellite, with its advantages of all-weather and night-vision capabilities and wide swath, can provide not only in-time footprint coverage at the desired disaster locations such as barrier lakes (堰塞湖), oil spill, wildfires, etc., but also general environment monitoring and disasters assessment, general resources survey and management support. In addition to the commercial data/information providers like the Astrium GEO Information Services and the MDA RADARSAT data provider, the data right issue and data availability prioritization to the users in other countries of the world remains to be an existing practice of the national satellite data/information providers, especially for sensitive data. Therefore, two microwave satellite remote sensing missions (via spaceborne active Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and passive MicroWave Radiometer (MWR) remote sensing techniques) have been planned by the National SPace Organization (NSPO) mission development teams in Taiwan. The two missions have been independently planned by selecting its own mission orbit and mission system architecture for maximizing the data/information acquisition for the disasters locations (such as those SAR data for assets, risk, hazard, reference, and rapid mappings) or the rainfall information via MWR remote sensing for monitoring of the incoming typhoons and monsoons (out of the ranging distances of radars in the Taiwan island) with the capability of providing early warning information for the disasters management community...|$|R

Total amount of the landslides was estimated about 200, 000 m^ 3, countless forest roads were cut, and two check dams were destroyed.
