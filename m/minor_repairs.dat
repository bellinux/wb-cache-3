5|$|Recruitment for the women's {{services}} {{began in}} June 1941. Most volunteers were married women, {{many of them}} the wives of military men.

Many {{of the women in the}} air service did skilled work, checking flying instruments, testing parts and doing <b>minor</b> <b>repairs.</b> The women of the Auxiliary Police Service served as BSAP officers both in stations and on the streets.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} built because the {{previous}} bridge, built in 1956, was {{nearing the end}} of its life span. The Nova Scotia Government had proposed <b>minor</b> <b>repairs,</b> but it was decided by the N.S. Government that an entirely new bridge would be more cost-effective. The new bridge was designed, unlike its predecessor, without large, overhead steel arches, because it would have been twice as costly to build. The new bridge was constructed on the same site as the old bridge's predecessor which was constructed just south of the East River Bridge in 1907.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey in}} 1932 {{found that the}} roof was cracked and it {{eventually}} collapsed in 1935. In 1936 the roof structure was straightened, preserving the medieval trusses where possible, and covered with clay tiles. The restoration was undertaken by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, with the work being funded by Roger Clark of the local shoemakers C. & J. Clark who bought the derelict barn for £5. It has been owned by the National Trust since 1938. Designation as a Grade I listed building first took place in 1961.

5|$|Construction work on Alabama, {{the fourth}} and final member of the South Dakota class, began on 1 February 1940 in the Norfolk Navy Yard with the keel laying. She was {{launched}} on 16 February 1942 and commissioned into service six months later, on 16 August. Alabama sailed on her shakedown cruise from the Chesapeake Bay on 11 November, which culminated in Casco Bay, Maine. <b>Minor</b> <b>repairs</b> were carried out in Norfolk, after which the big ship returned to Casco Bay to conduct training maneuvers with her sister, South Dakota. Beginning in March 1943, Alabama {{was assigned to the}} British Home Fleet, and tasked with convoy escort duties on the route to the Soviet Union. She was relieved of these duties in July so that she could return to Norfolk for a brief overhaul in August.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the status}} of its builder, Doune {{reflected}} current ideas of what a royal castle building should be. It was planned as a courtyard with ranges of buildings on each side, although only the northern and north-western buildings were completed. These comprise a large tower house over the entrance, containing the rooms of the Lord and his family, and a separate tower containing the kitchen and guest rooms. The two are linked by the great hall. The stonework is almost all from the late 14th century, with only <b>minor</b> <b>repairs</b> carried out in the 1580s. The restoration of the 1880s replaced the timber roofs and internal floors, as well as interior fittings.|$|E
5|$|William Bruce's {{appointment}} as Surveyor General of the King's Works in Scotland was made chiefly {{for the purpose}} of rebuilding the palace of Holyroodhouse. Aside from this project, he only carried out <b>minor</b> <b>repairs</b> to Edinburgh and Stirling Castles, and to the fortifications on the Bass Rock. Charles I had intended to extend and rebuild Holyroodhouse, and plans had been drawn up in the 1630s. Nothing was done however, and in 1650 the palace was burnt out, destroying all but the west range. Bruce was contracted to design and oversee the works, with Robert Mylne acting as contractor. Bruce's plans were drawn up by Mylne, as Bruce himself apparently lacked the technical skills of architectural drawing.|$|E

5|$|Division 11 {{arrived at}} Con Son Island on 29 July taking shelter from heavy seas and monsoon rains that had {{developed}} during the transit.

During the lay over at Con Son <b>minor</b> <b>repairs</b> were made and repainting was completed on some of the cutters' hulls which had been partially stripped of paint by the storm. Three RVN liaison officers reported aboard the cutters just before the division departed for Phu Quoc Island and the same three cutters started patrol work {{as the rest of the}} division put into Phu Quoc harbor on 31 July. On 30 July operational control of all Market Time elements, whether U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard or RVN, was transferred to the Commander, Task Force 115 (TF115).|$|E
5|$|In 1852, James Alexander Holden {{emigrated to}} South Australia from Walsall, England and in 1856 {{established}} J.A. Holden & Co, a saddlery business in Adelaide. In 1885, German-born H. A. Frost joined the {{business as a}} junior partner and J.A. Holden & Co became Holden & Frost Ltd. Edward Holden, James' grandson, joined the firm in 1905 {{with an interest in}} automobiles. From there, the firm evolved through various partnerships and, in 1908, Holden & Frost moved into the business of <b>minor</b> <b>repairs</b> to car upholstery. The company began to produce complete motorcycle sidecar bodies in 1913, and Edward experimented with fitting bodies to different types of carriages. After 1917, wartime trade restrictions led the company to start full-scale production of vehicle body shells. J.A. Holden founded a new company in 1919, Holden's Motor Body Builders Ltd (HMBB) specialising in car bodies and using a facility on King William Street in Adelaide.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Street Bridge {{opened for}} traffic in 1919, {{but had to}} be closed in 1932 after the {{southeast}} pier was excessively settled. The Connecticut Highway Department and federal government provided the funds required to remove the bascule leaves and replace the pier in 1936. As {{a part of the}} renovations, a new floor and electrical system were installed. In 1965, the bridge floor was replaced with steel grating atop 14-inch (36-cm) I-beam stringers. In 1984, the eastern approach span and northwest trunnion post, the point where the bridge pivots, were reconstructed as part of what would be the bridge's last major renovations. Other <b>minor</b> <b>repairs</b> to the bridge's steel and masonry were done during the project. The bridge was closed in the 1990s and it was dismantled in 1999. In 2010, the United States Coast Guard struck the rule pertaining to the operation of the bridge due to its removal. Previously, the rule stated that the bridge need not open for the passage of vessels.|$|E

5|$|Vermont then steamed to Newport before {{proceeding}} to Hampton Roads no 22 August where more target practice followed from 25 to 27 September. She {{and several other}} ships from the Atlantic Fleet then visited New York before some <b>minor</b> <b>repairs</b> were effected at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. By this time, the ship had been transferred to the 3rd Division. On 1 November, Vermont and several other ships of the Atlantic Fleet crossed the Atlantic for a visit of several western European ports, including Gravesend from 16 November to 7 December and Brest. The ships left Brest on 30 December to recross the Atlantic, bound for Cuban waters. From 13 January 1911 to 13 March, Vermont {{and the rest of}} the ships conducted maneuvers off Cuba. Further exercises followed off the Virginia Capes and in the Chesapeake Bay.

5|$|Voroshilov {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Marti South {{shipyard}} in Nikolayev on 15 October 1935; {{the second of the}} Project 26, to use their industrial designation, Kirov-class cruisers. She was launched on 28 June 1937, but she had to wait for her Soviet-built machinery to be delivered before she was completed on 20 June 1940. On 26 June 1941 Voroshilov covered Soviet destroyers bombarding Constanta, after the Germans attacked the Soviet Union, and was slightly damaged by a mine exploded by the destroyer 's paravanes. She bombarded Axis troops near Odessa on 19 September with 148 180mm shells and was transferred to Novorossiysk shortly afterwards. On 2 November the ship was bombed in harbor by Junkers Ju 88 bombers of Kampfgeschwader 51. She was hit twice; one hit started a fire in #3 magazine that was extinguished by water flooding in from the second hit. Voroshilov had to be towed to Poti for repairs, which lasted until February 1942. She shelled Axis positions near Feodosiya on 19 March and 3 April 1942, but was damaged by fragments from bombs from Ju 88s on 10 April and had to return to Batumi for <b>minor</b> <b>repairs.</b>|$|E
