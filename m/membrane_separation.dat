40|$|In this study, an {{in vitro}} model of immune complex-mediated {{basement}} <b>membrane</b> zone <b>separation</b> caused by periphigoid antibodies, serum complement, and peripheral blood leukocytes is described. When cryostat sections of fresh-frozen normal human skin {{were treated with}} either of 4 bullous pemiphigoid sera containing complement-activating anti-basement membrane zone antibodies and subsequently incubated at 37 °C with normal human peripheral blood leukocytes and fresh human serum, leukocytes attached to 96 % of the basement membrane zone in 100 % of sections. Sixty-seven percent of the sections developed focal areas of basement <b>membrane</b> zone <b>separation</b> resembling dermal-epidermal separation described in early pemphigoid lesions.
