25|$|Bell worked {{extensively}} in medical research and invented techniques for teaching {{speech to the}} deaf. During his Volta Laboratory period, Bell and his associates considered impressing a magnetic field on a record {{as a means of}} reproducing sound. Although the trio briefly experimented with the concept, they could not develop a workable prototype. They abandoned the idea, never realizing they had glimpsed a basic principle which would one day find its application in the tape recorder, the hard disc and floppy disc drive, and other <b>magnetic</b> <b>media.</b>|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the chief}} {{usability}} problems of the floppy disk is its vulnerability; even inside a closed plastic housing, the disk medium is highly sensitive to dust, condensation and temperature extremes. As with all magnetic storage, it is vulnerable to magnetic fields. Blank disks have been distributed with an extensive set of warnings, cautioning the user not to expose it to dangerous conditions. Disks must not be roughly treated or removed from the drive while the <b>magnetic</b> <b>media</b> is still spinning, since doing so is likely to cause damage to the disk, drive head, or stored data.

2500|$|When used in {{the same}} manner as {{external}} rotating drives (hard drives, optical drives, or floppy drives), i. e. in ignorance of their technology, USB drives' failure is more likely to be sudden: while rotating drives can fail instantaneously, they more frequently give some indication (noises, slowness) that they are about to fail, often with enough advance warning that data can be removed before total failure. USB drives give little or no advance warning of failure. [...] Furthermore, when internal wear-leveling is applied to prolong life of the flash drive, once failure of even part of the memory occurs it can be difficult or impossible to use the remainder of the drive, which differs from <b>magnetic</b> <b>media,</b> where bad sectors can be marked permanently not to be used.|$|E

30|$|Coaxial nanocable is {{a special}} kind of 1 D {{nanostructure}} in a composite system, which has attracted much interest for its unique structure and properties. Therefore, the nanocables have potential applications in the fields of catalyst, energy storage, photoelectric material, nanobiotechnology, environmental protection, magnetic sensor, and <b>magnetic</b> recording <b>media</b> [1 – 11]. The development of <b>magnetic</b> recording <b>media</b> is limited by the super-paramagnetic [12] and plane recording limit. Perpendicular recording involves recording data in vertical, three-dimensional columns rather than in two dimensions. To overcome these limitations, either the structure of nanomaterials or the effective anisotropy of the material can be innovated and improved. Ferromagnetic cylinders are suggested as a medium for achieving this objective.|$|R

50|$|Historically, {{secondary}} storage in computer systems has been implemented primarily by using magnetic {{properties of the}} surface coatings applied to rotating platters (in hard disk drives and floppy disks) or linearly moving narrow strips of plastic film (in tape drives). Pairing such <b>magnetic</b> <b>media</b> with read/write heads allows data to be written by separately magnetizing small sections of the ferromagnetic coating, and read later by detecting the transitions in magnetization. For the data to be read or written, exact sections of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>media</b> need to pass under the read/write heads that flow closely to the media surface; as a result, reading or writing data imposes delays required for the positioning of <b>magnetic</b> <b>media</b> and heads, with the delays differing depending on the actual technology.|$|E
