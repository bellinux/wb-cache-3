25|$|Early Duala {{history may}} only be conjectured from oral traditions. The Duala trace their ancestry back to a man named Mbedi, who lived in an area called Bakota in what is today Gabon or the Republic of the Congo. His sons, Ewale and Dibombo, {{migrated}} north and reached a place called Pitti on the Dibamba River. Here, the brothers parted ways after a row. Ewale moved {{to the mouth of}} the Dibamba with his followers and then northwest to the east bank of Wouri River estuary. Meanwhile, Dibongo and his companions migrated southeast to the Sanaga River and then split up, some heading upstream with Dibongo and others <b>moving</b> <b>downstream</b> with a man named Elimbe. Ewale's people became the Duala, and Dibongo's the Limba.|$|E
25|$|Saltwater {{crocodiles}} generally {{spend the}} tropical wet season in freshwater swamps and rivers, <b>moving</b> <b>downstream</b> to estuaries {{in the dry}} season, and sometimes travelling far out to sea. Crocodiles compete fiercely {{with each other for}} territory, with dominant males in particular occupying the most eligible stretches of freshwater creeks and streams. Junior crocodiles are thus forced into the more marginal river systems and sometimes into the ocean. This explains the large distribution of the animal (ranging from the east coast of India to northern Australia), as well as its being found in the odd places on occasion (such as the Sea of Japan). Like all crocodiles, they can survive for prolonged periods in only warm temperatures, and crocodiles seasonally vacate parts of Australia if cold spells hit.|$|E

On the night of 12 September and morning of 13 September, however, the camp may have contained as few as 40 men, as others were off harvesting. Vaudreuil and others had expressed their concern at the possibility of L'Anse-au-Foulon being vulnerable, but Montcalm dismissed them, saying 100 men would hold off the army until daylight, remarking, [...] "It is not to be supposed that the enemies have wings so that they can in the same night cross the river, disembark, climb the obstructed acclivity, and scale the walls, for which last operation they would have to carry ladders." ...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{hypothesis}} {{from the}} hydrological literature is that <b>downstream</b> <b>moving</b> storms with storm length () less than watershed length () magnify the peak discharges. This hypothesis was {{developed from the}} kinematic-wave modeling, and was evaluated in a plot between the dimensionless peak discharge and dimensionless storm velocity. Previously unpublished experimental data collected from the Watershed Experimentation System (WES), obtained from the late Professor Ben C. Yen at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, were used {{in comparison with the}} simulation results of the kinematic-wave model. It is found that <b>downstream</b> <b>moving</b> storms with ⁄ 1 increase the peak discharges to a limited extent compared to stationary storms, but the kinematic-wave model overstates the increase in the peak flows resulting from <b>downstream</b> <b>moving</b> storms with ⁄ 1. This difference between model projections and laboratory data was attributed to backwater effects in the experimental runoff. To evaluate the importance of the backwater effects, the accuracy of kinematic-wave and dynamic-wave models for the simulation of surface runoff resulting from moving storms was evaluated utilizing the same experimental data. It is found that, the kinematic-wave model canno...|$|R
