50|$|Mac OS X Tiger {{brought more}} subtle changes, {{including}} the unified titlebar scheme. Pinstripes {{were removed from}} the menu bar entirely and replaced with a glossy, white look. Tabs were altered to appear as normal segmented buttons. The Apple <b>menu</b> <b>icon</b> was toned down to a more matte appearance and the new Spotlight search utility was permanently bound to the very right of the menu bar in the same color and gradient of the Apple menu.|$|E
50|$|This {{game was}} {{featured}} in the Japanese release of Namco Museum Volume 2 for the PlayStation. For the American version of Namco Museum Volume 2, Super Pac-Man {{was featured in}} place of Cutie Q, but {{an analysis of the}} disc's files reveals that Cutie Qs files are still present, including the executable file. However, attempts to run the executable file directly fail, so the game is rendered unplayable in the American version of Namco Museum Volume 2, due to not having a <b>menu</b> <b>icon</b> to run it during gameplay. In 2007, the game was also added to Namco Museum Remix for the Wii console.|$|E

5000|$|Devices of {{the time}} mainly had 480×240 pixel {{displays}} {{with the exception of}} the Hewlett-Packard 'Palmtop PC' which had a 640×240 display. Each window took over the full display. Navigation was done by tapping or double tapping on an item. A contextual menu was also available by the user pressing the ALT key and tapping on the screen. Windows CE 1.0 did not include a cascading Start menu unlike Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 did. Microsoft released the Windows CE 1.0 Power Toys that included a cascading <b>menu</b> <b>icon</b> that appeared in the system tray. Also bundled were several other utilities, most notable were a sound applet for the system tray, enabling the user to quickly mute or unmute their device or adjust the volume and a 'pocket' version of Paint.|$|E
5000|$|... 1994 saw the {{introduction}} of the MicroTAC Elite and the [...] "International" [...] series, the then smallest and light-weight model available at the time. It weighed in at a mere 3.9 oz with the slim battery. The Elite was a function of NAMPS technology from 1993. The Elite was also produced in a rare MicroTAC Elite VIP (pictured), which had a black housing, gold lettering, and an orange LED display, over the ordinary Elite, which had a gray housing, a green LED display, and white lettering. The Elite series was a feature-packed phone and retailed for around $600. The phone included a first-ever two line display, for a total of 14 dot-matrix characters. There were also separate LED indicator meters for signal strength and battery, as well as a <b>Menu</b> <b>Icon</b> Display. The phone's software offered advanced menu features, and each category, when accessed, was indicated with green icons {{at the bottom of the}} display. Categories included Phone Book, Timers, Security, Tone Control, Phone Options, and Answering Machine / Messaging. This was the first mobile phone to have a built-in, recordable answering machine. It was also the first mobile phone to use a Lithium-Ion battery.|$|E

30|$|Despite {{the clear}} {{importance}} of maintaining effective visual awareness, research exploring phenomena such as change blindness and inattentional blindness reveals how people {{often fail to}} detect visual changes and unexpected objects in their environments (Jensen, Yao, Street, & Simons, 2011; Levin & Baker, 2015; Simons & Levin, 1997; Varakin, Levin, & Fidler, 2004). These failures of awareness imply that viewers are not representing and remembering what they see, but this seems to conflict with research that documents people’s ability to represent large amounts of visual information and more generally to learn from their experiences. One means of reconciling this apparent conflict is by assuming that change blindness is a very narrow failure that occurs {{in the face of}} otherwise effective visual representations. For example, imagine that someone watching an informational video teaching spreadsheet formulas fails to notice that a <b>menu</b> <b>icon</b> suddenly changes color. This could be a sign that they have failed to represent anything about the icons and by extension have not learned much at all about the videos. However, {{it is also possible that}} the viewer remembers plenty about the icons—they just didn’t compare the pre- and post-change views, and more generally, their failure to detect the change may say little about the degree to which they have learned the contents of the video.|$|E
40|$|The {{components}} of the Excel application window are the title bar, the menu bar, the toolbars, the formula bar, the status bar and the task pane. The title bar displays {{the name of the}} open application and document. The control <b>menu</b> <b>icon</b> enables you to control the size and position of the Excel application window. The three buttons at the right end of the title bar enables you to minimize, maximize and close the application window. Worksheets In Excel, spreadsheets are called worksheets and worksheets are contained in a file called a workbook. Once the application is opened, a new blank workbook will be provided for you that contains three worksheets [...] sheet 1, sheet 2 and sheet 3. Toolbars There are two frequently-used toolbars displayed in the following: the Standard toolbar and the Formatting toolbar. Each has buttons that provide shortcuts for accomplishing many Excel tasks. By pointing to a button with the mouse pointer, you can display a pop-up text box, called a ScreenTip, containing the button's name. Cells The intersection of a column and a row is called a cell. Formula Bars The formula bar displays the value or formula in a selected cell. Task Panes When you first start Excel, the task pane is located on the right-hand side of the window. It provides easy access to many common tasks performed in Excel...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the differences in ICT learning outcomes among students who received the treatment method of the type of Cooperative Learning Make A Match and Conventional methods on the class of the semester X 2 SMA Negeri 1 Sewon Bantul School Year 2010 / 2011. The research method used is a Quasi Experimental method The Nonequivalent Control Group Design. Research instruments in the form of multiple-choice test of 20 questions for basic competency using the <b>menu</b> <b>icon</b> located in the software spreadsheets (Microsoft Excel) and 20 questions for the competencies basic to use formulas and functions such as arithmetic operations, IF and Lookup functions. The population in the study were students in class X and class are used as research samples of class XA and XB. Analysis of data for testing the research results using the test for normality, homogeneity test and the test to determine differences in yield increase student learning classroom experiments and grade control. The results showed that there are differences in the increase of learning in both classroom visits from the pretest, posttest and gain. Comparison of the average value of the gain on the Basics 2. 1 Competence experimental class and control class is 0. 31 0. 04 while the average value of the gain at 2. 2 Basic Competence experimental class and control class is 0. 34 0. 09. This shows that the results of classroom learning using the Make A Match on ICT subjects is greater than the conventional classroom. So it can be concluded that there are differences between the methods of student learning outcomes Cooperative Learning Make A Match type with conventional methods in ICT subjects in SMA 1 Sewon Bantul.

40|$|Graphical {{interfaces}} allow {{users to}} issue commands using pull-down <b>menus,</b> <b>icon</b> toolbars, and keyboard shortcuts. Menus and icon toolbars {{are easier to}} learn, whereas keyboard shortcuts are more efficient. It would seem natural for users to migrate {{from the use of}} easy-to-learn <b>menu</b> and <b>icon</b> methods to the more efficient method of key-board shortcuts as they gain experience. To investigate the extent to which this transi-tion takes place, 251 experienced users of Microsoft Word were given a questionnaire assessing their choice of methods for the most frequently occurring commands. Con-trary to our expectations, most experienced users rarely used the efficient keyboard shortcuts, favoring the use of icon toolbars instead. A second study was done to verify that keyboard shortcuts are, indeed, the most efficient method. Six participants per-formed common commands using <b>menu</b> selection, <b>icon</b> toolbars, and keyboard short-cuts. The keyboard shortcuts were, as expected, the most efficient. We conclude that even experienced users are inefficient in their use of graphical interfaces. One possible way to improve user efficiency is for training programs to provide a roadmap for users to make the transition from using pull-down <b>menus</b> and clicking <b>icon</b> toolbars to issu-ing keyboard shortcuts. 1...|$|R
