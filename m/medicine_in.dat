40|$|Objectives - To {{explore the}} views and {{perspectives}} of {{children on the}} unlicensed/off-label use of <b>medicines</b> <b>in</b> children and on the participation of children in clinical trials. Methods - Focus-group discussions, involving school children, were carried out {{in a range of}} primary and secondary schools in Northern Ireland. A purposeful sample was chosen to facilitate representation of various socioeconomic groupings. Results - A total of 123 pupils, aged from 10 to 16 years, from six schools, participated in 16 focus groups. In general, pupils viewed the unlicensed/off-label use of <b>medicines</b> <b>in</b> children as unsafe and unethical and felt it is necessary to test <b>medicines</b> <b>in</b> children to improve the availability of licensed products. The majority felt that older children should be told, and that parents should be told, about the unlicensed/off-label use of <b>medicines</b> <b>in</b> children, yet they recognised some implications of this, such as potential medication non-adherence. Conclusions - This is the first study to explore the views of healthy children on unlicensed <b>medicine</b> use <b>in</b> children. Children were able to recognise potential risks associated with the unlicensed use of medicines and felt it is necessary to test and license more <b>medicines</b> <b>in</b> children. Practice implications - Health care professionals should consider the views of children in decisions that affect their health...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Natural sources used as folk <b>medicines</b> <b>in</b> Merzifon were {{investigated}} in this study. It {{was determined that}} 35 plant and 4 animal species together with 3 animal and 1 inorganic sources are being used as various preparations of folk <b>medicines</b> <b>in</b> Merzifon area. All the collected medicinal plants were identified and voucher specimens were deposited in the Herbarium of Hacettepe University, Faculty of Pharmacy (HUEF). Local names, part(s) used, methods of preparation and traditional usages of folk <b>medicines</b> are given <b>in</b> this paper. Traditional herbal medicines were mostly used for gastrointestinal system diseases, heart and circulatory system disorders. When our findings were compared with previously published literatures on folk <b>medicines</b> <b>in</b> Turkey, new local names for 4 species and different usages for 6 plants were found. Moreover, Scorzonera eriphora DC. and Beta trigyna Waldst & Kit. {{were found to be}} used as folk <b>medicines</b> <b>in</b> Turkey {{for the first time in}} this study...|$|R

Still believed that the conventional medical system lacked credible efficacy, was morally corrupt, and treated effects rather than causes of disease. He founded osteopathic <b>medicine</b> <b>in</b> rural Missouri {{at a time when}} medications, surgery, and other traditional therapeutic regimens often caused more harm than good. Some of the medicines commonly given to patients during this time were arsenic, castor oil, whiskey, and opium. In addition, unsanitary surgical practices often resulted in more deaths than cures.|$|E
