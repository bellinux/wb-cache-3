Rubber/Ca-montmorillonite(Ca-MMT) nanocomposites with exfoliated Ca-MMT layers was {{prepared}} {{by a new}} preparation method named <b>masterbatch</b> method, in which the <b>masterbatch</b> {{was prepared}} by co-coagulating nature rubber latex and bis[3 -triethoxysilylpropyl-]tetrasulfide (TESPT) modified Ca-MMT aqueous suspension and then the <b>masterbatch</b> accompanied with carbon black (N 220) {{were used in the}} system of SBR and ENR. The properties of TESPT in-situ modified Ca-MMT were investigated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis.

First stage is the preliminary study on the effect of the <b>masterbatch</b> technique on the basic properties of unsaturated polyester. <b>Masterbatch</b> technique is the mixing of powder P 84 Polyimide with liquid MEKP prior to be incorporated into the polyester resin, where a mixture that contain both filler and curing agent was produced.

50|$|The {{alternatives}} to using <b>masterbatches</b> are buying a fully compounded material (which {{may be more}} expensive and less open to e.g. color variability of the product), or compounding from raw materials on site (which is prone to issues with achieving full dispersion of the colorants and additives, and prone to preparing more material than {{what is used for}} the production run).

30|$|To obtain good {{dispersion}} of CNTs in polymers, we can prepare the CNT <b>masterbatch</b> by mixing CNTs and carriers first, {{and then the}} <b>masterbatch</b> are diluted with thermoplastics to produce the CNT/polymer composites. There are three kinds of methods to prepare the CNT <b>masterbatch.</b> The first method is so-called in situ polymerization method [1]‐[4]: the monomers and CNTs are mixed well in a solution. Then, the monomers are polymerized, and therefore, the CNTs can disperse in the polymer polymerized from the monomers. However, this method usually needs the chemical modification of CNTs for well-dispersed CNTs in the solution, and it could damage the structure of CNTs and reduce their conductivity. The second method is the solution process [5]‐[7]: the CNTs and the polymer solution are mixed well, and the CNT/polymer composites are obtained by re-precipitation or removing the solvent from the mixture. This method can easily disperse the CNTs in the polymer; however, it is not suitable for mass production due to its high cost, toxicity of the solvent, and solubility limitations of the polymer in the solvent. The third method is the melt-mixing [5, 8]: the CNTs and polymer are directly mixed at high temperature (usually above the glass transition temperature of the polymer) by mechanical mixing. The melt-mixing is also {{an easy way to}} produce the CNT <b>masterbatch,</b> but the CNTs are difficult to disperse well in the polymer.|$|R
