40|$|The {{purpose is}} to provide an {{analysis}} of the risk factors influencing non-compliance in UK organic farming. The paper uses a formal econometric model of risk analysis to provide empirical evidence on the determinants of non-compliance in organic farming. A panel of data from the archives of the largest control body in the UK for 2007 - 2009 is used, and specific analyses are performed for two types of non-compliances. A zero inflated count data model is used for the estimation, taking into account the fact that the occurrences of non-compliance are very sparse. Results show the existence of strong co-dependence of non-compliant behaviours (i. e. the occurrence of major and critical non-compliance increases the probability of occurrence of the minor one; similarly the probability of occurrence of major non-compliance increases when <b>minor</b> <b>non-compliance</b> occur). Besides, livestock production and farm size are relevant risk factors. Albeit highly representative, the findings are based on Soil Association data only and not on all UK organic farms. The paper provides practical indications for control bodies, concerning aspects that could be strengthened for more efficient risk-based inspections. The paper advocates the use of financial information like turnover or capital stock, and of data concerning the characteristics of the farmers, that could substantially improve the probability of detecting the most severe non-compliances. Certification is essential for organic farming, and an improvement of inspection procedures through a risk-based approach could add efficiency and effectiveness to the whole organic food system, with obvious advantages for consumers and the society as a whole. This paper provides for the first time empirical evidence concerning the implementation of the organic certification system in the UK...|$|E

If the forest management {{is in full}} compliance with FSC requirements, the FSC certificate is awarded. If the forest management is not fully compliant, pre-conditions are noted which must be fulfilled before the FSC certificate can be awarded. If <b>minor</b> <b>non-compliances</b> are noted, the certificate can be issued with conditions {{that have to be}} met within a clearly determined timeframe.|$|R
5000|$|A {{facility}} may {{request a}} Silver level certification if an audit finds {{that it is}} in substantial compliance with the WRAP principles, but has <b>minor</b> <b>non-compliances</b> in policies, procedures or training that need to be addressed. Facilities seeking certification through this route must request a Silver certificate in writing from a WRAP office at the conclusion of their first formal audit as a certificate will not be automatically issued. Important points to note in this regard are: ...|$|R
30|$|The {{caseworker}} counsels and {{advises the}} UBII recipient and decides about placement in active labor market programs. If the caseworker detects non-compliance of the UBII recipient, the welfare agency is legally required {{to impose a}} sanction by benefit revocation (Chapters 31, 31 a, 31 b and 32 of Book II of the German Social Code). However, there is discretion at the agency level whether a sanction is actually imposed or not. All UBII recipients are informed {{about the possibility of}} sanctions in the integration contract and each time they are assigned to a program. Yet, there is no formal warning process when a non-compliance is detected. Although a hearing of the benefit recipient is formally required before the imposition of a sanction, there is evidence that this requirement is not implemented in practice as reported by Baethge-Kinsky et al. (2007). Hence, the welfare agency may immediately impose a sanction. Sanctions have a duration of three months and can be imposed for various reasons. For <b>minor</b> <b>non-compliances,</b> such as the failure to properly report on job search activities to the welfare agency or not showing up for an appointment with the caseworker, benefits are cut by 10 %. More severe infringements (lack of job search effort, refusal to accept a suitable job offer, refusal to participate in a program) lead to a benefit reduction of 30 %. In case of repeated incidents of severe infringements within one year, a second (60 % cut) or a third sanction (100 % cut) can be imposed. A similar possibility exists in the case of repeated <b>minor</b> <b>non-compliances,</b> where sanctions can be increased gradually by 10 % up to a cut of 100 %. For UBII recipients below 25 years of age, benefits can be reduced by 100 % even for the first incident of non-compliance.|$|R
50|$|If an {{organisation}} is correctly {{aligned with}} the Standard, the assessment report {{will be sent to}} The Law Society and the standard awarded. If an organisation's policies, plans, procedures and processes are not correctly {{aligned with the}} Lexcel standard, the assessor will note minor or major 'non-compliances'. Where an organisation is being assessed for the first time, they have up to six months to correct the non-compliances and on completion of any necessary work, will then be awarded the Lexcel Standard. Subsequent assessments will result in <b>minor</b> <b>non-compliances</b> having to be corrected within three weeks and major non-compliances within three months. Award of the standard lasts three years subject to satisfactory annual maintenance visits (AMVs). At the end of the three-year award, if the organisation wishes to continue with Lexcel, a full re-assessment is again undertaken.|$|R
40|$|Background and Context: Resistance to care (RTC) is a {{defensive}} patient response to nurses and associated behaviour ranges from <b>minor</b> irritation or <b>non-compliance</b> to aggression and violence resulting in injury to staff. Previous studies of RTC {{have been conducted}} in aged care settings on patient populations with dementia. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the prevalence of RTC in several clinical environments and the effects of RTC episodes on nurses. Methodology: A cross sectional survey was conducted on a sample of 5, 044 nurses from the NSW Nurses Association membership, representing five specialty areas of practice: emergency department, mental health, aged care and medical and surgical nursing. The response rate was 23. 3 %. Findings: RTC episodes were reported to occur 2 - 4 times per week by 80 % of participants, and more frequently in emergency, mental health and aged care settings. Nursing activities associated with RTC episodes were: assisting patients with activities of daily living, moving patients, procedures and assisting mental health patients. The RTC behaviours were similar to those reported for patient initiated violence however the resultant injuries were less severe and less frequent (18 %). The professional and personal impact of RTC on nurses included: considering leaving nursing, fear and anxiety, powerlessness and helplessness, burnout, depression, low mood/ sadness, reduced morale...|$|R
