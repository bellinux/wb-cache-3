5|$|Ric confronts {{his brother}} about Esi, and Kumi {{tells him that}} their father died of AIDS, but the family kept it secret to avoid {{bringing}} shame on themselves. Because of her relationship with his father, Esi is also HIV positive. Ric confides in Diane, who attempts to kiss him, but Ric tells her {{to go home to}} her husband Owen.

5|$|Running {{throughout}} all the many paths his life could take or has taken, the adult Nemo recurringly awakens in a surrealistic world dominated by argyle patterns. This setting seems artificial, {{like a movie}} set, and often appears to bleed over into his other lives. Following clues that he finds scattered throughout this city, he ultimately arrives at a crumbling, abandoned wooden-framed house. He stumbles upon a DVD player {{hooked up to a}} television screen. In the strangely interactive video, the 118-year-old Nemo converses with the 34-year-old one. He explains that the younger man does not exist. This is a universe where Nemo Nobody was never born, and his consciousness is stuck in some sort of limbo. He states that he is experiencing the story from the end and that he <b>must</b> <b>stay</b> alive until 5:50 AM on 12 February 2092.|$|E
5|$|There are {{different}} types of starts for races of different distances. Middle- and long-distance races mainly use the waterfall start. This is when all athletes begin on a curved line that moves farther out at {{the outer edge of}} the track. Competitors are allowed to move towards the inside lane right away, as long as it is safe to do so. For some middle-distance races, such as 800m, each athlete starts in their own lane. Once the gun fires, they must run in the lane they began in until markers on the track notify them it is time to move towards the inside lane. For sprint races, athletes begin in start blocks and <b>must</b> <b>stay</b> in their own lane for the entire race.|$|E
5|$|Complex taboos and rites are {{associated}} with a woman's first childbirth. When about to give birth she is secluded in a special birthing house called a komby. The leaves she eats from and the waste produced by the newborn are kept in a special receptacle for seven days, at which point they are burned. The ash produced is rubbed on the forehead and cheeks of the mother and baby and must be worn for seven days. On the fifteenth day both are bathed in water in which lime or lemon leaves have been soaked. This ritual is called ranom-boahangy (bath of the leaves). The community gathers to drink rum and celebrate with wrestling matches, but the mother <b>must</b> <b>stay</b> in the komby. She is not allowed to consume anything other than saonjo greens and a chicken specially prepared for her. After this celebration she is required to leave the komby and can return to routine life.|$|E

5|$|Later, Michael tells Rex he <b>must</b> <b>stay</b> {{with his}} Aunt Carol, as Michael {{is working on}} a case with a {{dangerous}} suspect. His partner, Bird, goes to his house, after trying to call him to make sure he is alright, but then looks in the garage and finds Michael's work on his accident and Detective Hawkins. Bird goes to Dr. Judith Evans, who reluctantly advises Bird to check on Michael. Michael goes to Ed Hawkins' house, shoots Hawkins in the leg, and asks him for evidence. Hawkins says heroin was taken from various evidence lockers and sent out for sale through Westfield Distribution, and further evidence is on his laptop. Hawkins tries to overpower Michael, forcing him to kill Hawkins, right before Bird enters the house. Michael takes Bird's gun and handcuffs him. Bird suggests that to get into Hawkins' laptop, they use a hacker they both worked with previously, right before he knocks out Michael, who wakes up in the red reality.|$|E
5|$|The group battles Fei-Wang who {{destroys the}} Syaoran clone when he betrays him. He then uses the immeasurably strong ability and {{strength}} of the two Sakuras to resurrect Yūko, accidentally frozen in time by Clow Reed himself to halt her death, therein proving himself Clow's superior. Yūko uses her life and Clow's magic as payment to make the clones reborn {{in the past to}} live together. As the two know all of the series' events would repeat, the clones seal themselves in Yūko's shop until the battle against him. The group manages to kill Fei-Wang, who traps Syaoran in a void between time and space, dragging both his clone and Watanuki along as a consequence of their connection. With their creator's death, both clones of Sakura and Syaoran fade away leaving behind two feathers. Syaoran and Watanuki escape from the void for a price: Syaoran must continue traveling through the dimensions forever, while Watanuki <b>must</b> <b>stay</b> in Yūko's shop. The group rests in the Kingdom of Clow where Fai, Kurogane, and Mokona decide to join Syaoran once again in hope of finding a way to bring back the clones who still exist as the two feathers. Before departing on their separate ways, Syaoran and Sakura confess their mutually strong, close and pure romantic love for each other as they hope to meet again.|$|E

25|$|Multiplayer: Rampages {{have been}} {{modified}} to allow two players to complete them. The players are both shown simultaneously on the screen, meaning they <b>must</b> <b>stay</b> within close proximity of each other. The multiplayer rampages provide such functionality.|$|E
25|$|The ball <b>must</b> <b>stay</b> {{within the}} court; the last team {{to touch the}} ball before it travels out of bounds forfeits possession. The ball is out of bounds if it touches a {{boundary}} line, or touches any player or object {{that is out of}} bounds.|$|E
25|$|On 24 July 1945, the British {{occupation}} force, {{contrary to}} Danish expectations, {{decided that the}} refugees <b>must</b> <b>stay</b> in Denmark until the situation in Germany had stabilised. The first refugees were returned to Germany in November 1946 and the last ones in February 1949. Only very few stayed in Denmark for good.|$|E

25|$|Technical dives may {{alternatively}} {{be defined}} as dives where the diver cannot safely ascend directly to the surface either due to a mandatory decompression stop or a physical ceiling. This form of diving implies a much larger reliance on redundancy of critical equipment and procedural training since the diver <b>must</b> <b>stay</b> underwater until {{it is safe to}} ascend or the diver has successfully exited the overhead environment.|$|E
25|$|Overtime: The {{existing}} contract stated {{that if any}} stagehand is required to work overtime during a load-in, all workers <b>must</b> <b>stay</b> and be paid overtime. The producers proposed loosening the rule so that producers determined how many stagehands would stay and earn overtime. The union agreed to discuss modifying the contract, {{but only if the}} League agreed to strengthen other parts of the contract.|$|E
25|$|In addition, PPQ offers {{customers}} 'retro' plates, {{which are}} essentially general-issue plates {{that may be}} retained if customers change vehicles. As vintage general issue 'Q' plates, white-on-black plates and green-on-white plates will eventually attract a relatively high price among classic car collectors and restorers, PPQ has made retro plates essentially non-transferable; that is, they may be attached to many different vehicles, but the listed owner(s) <b>must</b> <b>stay</b> the same with each registration and can only be transferred to direct relations.|$|E

Elliot then threatened to remove them from the transplant team. The pair soon made amends pleasing Elliot whose team on Darwin ward was once again solid.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with Nastassya Filippovna's wish, {{she and the}} Prince become engaged. Public opinion is highly critical of Myshkin's actions toward Aglaya, and the Yepanchins break off all relations with him. He tries to explain to Yevgeny Pavlovich that Nastassya Filippovna is a broken soul, that he <b>must</b> <b>stay</b> with her or she will probably die, and that Aglaya will understand if he is only allowed to talk to her. Yevgeny Pavlovich refuses to facilitate any contact between them and suspects that Myshkin himself is mad.|$|E
25|$|Chain Reaction is a {{mode that}} is similar to Turf War. This has the player {{capturing}} posts, but the player must do them in a specific order – one team works out from their base needing to capture 1 through 5 while the other team starts out from their home and needs to snag 5 through 1. King of the Hill has players capturing a hill, spawned on the map to score points. They <b>must</b> <b>stay</b> in the hill to score points while the enemy team tries to do the same.|$|E

50|$|Monochromatic chess is a chess variant {{created by}} Raymond Smullyan, {{in which the}} initial board {{position}} and all rules {{are the same as}} in regular chess, except that pieces which begin on a black square <b>must</b> always <b>stay</b> on a black square and pieces which begin on a white square <b>must</b> always <b>stay</b> on a white square. This would mean that knights can never move, but The Classified Encyclopedia of Chess Variants says that knights make a double jump. It has been suggested that a knight be replaced with a (3,1)-leaper.|$|R
