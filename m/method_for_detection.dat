25|$|Silver {{staining}} is {{used when}} more sensitive <b>method</b> <b>for</b> <b>detection</b> is needed, as classical Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining can usually detect a 50ng protein band, Silver staining increases the sensitivity typically 10-100 fold more. This {{is based on}} the chemistry of photographic development. The proteins are fixed to the gel with a dilute methanol solution, then incubated with an acidic silver nitrate solution. Silver ions are reduced to their metallic form by formaldehyde at alkaline pH. An acidic solution, such as acetic acid stops development. Silver staining was introduced by Kerenyi and Gallyas as a sensitive procedure to detect trace amounts of proteins in gels. The technique has been extended to the study of other biological macromolecules that have been separated in a variety of supports. Many variables can influence the colour intensity and every protein has its own staining characteristics; clean glassware, pure reagents and water of highest purity are the key points to successful staining. Silver staining was developed in the 14th century for colouring the surface of glass. It has been used extensively for this purpose since the 16th century. The colour produced by the early silver stains ranged between light yellow and an orange-red. Camillo Golgi perfected the silver staining {{for the study of the}} nervous system. Golgi's method stains a limited number of cells at random in their entirety.|$|E

Further refinements of the method have enabled detection of 5-HT, norepinephrine, adenosine, oxygen, pH changes in vivo in rats and mice as well as measurement of dopamine and serotonin concentration in fruit flies.|$|E
50|$|Despite being a {{powerful}} model organism for biology {{and the study}} of transcriptional enhancers, the tissue specific activity of less than 5% of the estimated 50,000 transcriptional enhancers in Drosophila melanogaster have been discovered. Over the past decade, the main <b>method</b> <b>for</b> <b>detection</b> of tissue- or cell-type specific activities of enhancers in Drosophila melanogaster was to test candidate enhancers by traditional reporter assays, which are low-throughput and costly.

50|$|The H/D {{exchange}} reaction {{can also}} be catalysed, by acid, base or metal catalysts such as platinum. For the backbone amide hydrogen atoms of proteins, the minimum exchange rate occurs at approximately pH 2.6, on average. By performing the exchange at neutral pH and then rapidly changing the pH, the exchange rates of the backbone amide hydrogens can be dramatically slowed, or quenched. The pH at which the reaction is quenched depends on the analysis <b>method.</b> <b>For</b> <b>detection</b> by NMR, the pH may be moved to around 4.0-4.5. For detection by mass spectrometry, the pH is dropped to the minimum of the exchange curve, pH 2.6. In the most basic experiment, the reaction is allowed to take place for a set time before it is quenched.|$|E
