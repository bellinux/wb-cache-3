Error-correcting codes (ECCs) can be employed {{in order to provide}} signal transmission with the necessary data integrity. In this paper, the impact of ECCs to encode the information on a very deep submicrometer bus on bus power consumption is analyzed. To fulfill this purpose, both the bus wires (with <b>mutual</b> <b>capacitances,</b> drivers, repeaters and receivers) and the encoding-decoding circuitry are accounted for. After a detailed analysis of power dissipation in deep submicrometer fault-tolerant busses using Hamming single ECCs, it is shown that no power saving is possible by choosing among different Hamming codes. A novel scheme, called dual rail, is then proposed. It is shown that dual rail, combined with a proper bus layout, can provide a reduction of energy consumption.

40|$|A four-terminal donor {{quantum dot}} (QD) {{is used to}} {{characterize}} potential barriers between degenerately doped nanoscale contacts. The QD is fabricated by hydrogen-resist lithography on Si(001) in combination with n-type doping by phosphine. The four contacts have different separations (d = 9, 12, 16 and 29 nm) to the central 6 nm × 6 nm QD island, leading to different tunnel and capacitive coupling. Cryogenic transport measurements in the Coulomb-blockade (CB) regime are used to characterize these tunnel barriers. We find that field enhancement near the apex of narrow dopant leads is an important effect that influences both barrier breakdown and {{the magnitude of the}} tunnel current in the CB transport regime. From CB-spectroscopy measurements, we extract the <b>mutual</b> <b>capacitances</b> between the QD and the four contacts, which scale inversely with the contact separation d. The capacitances are in excellent agreement with numerical values calculated from the pattern geometry in the hydrogen resist.

50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{capacitive}} sensing system: <b>mutual</b> <b>capacitance,</b> where the object (finger, conductive stylus) alters the mutual coupling between row and column electrodes, which are scanned sequentially; and self- or absolute capacitance where the object (such as a finger) loads the sensor or increases the parasitic capacitance to ground.

We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for {{the accuracy of the}} approximation (over a O(ϵ^(− 1)) time-scale), and show how B can be computed (at a cost independent of ϵ). As a direct application, we investigate the possibility of using RLC circuits to harvest the energy contained in small scale oscillations of ambient electromagnetic fields (such as Schumann resonances). Although a RLC circuit parametrically coupled to the field may achieve such energy extraction via parametric resonance, its resistance R needs to be smaller than a threshold κ proportional to the fluctuations of the field, thereby limiting practical applications. We show that if n RLC circuits are appropriately coupled via <b>mutual</b> <b>capacitances</b> or inductances, then energy extraction can be achieved when the resistance of each circuit is smaller than nκ. Hence, if the resistance of each circuit has a non-zero fixed value, energy extraction can be made possible through the coupling of a sufficiently large number n of circuits (n≈ 1000 for the first mode of Schumann resonances and contemporary values of capacitances, inductances and resistances).

We explored ion specificity in supercapacitors using a modified Poisson-Boltzmann approach that includes ionic dispersion energies. We have applied ab initio quantum chemical methods to determine required ion sizes and ion polarisabilities. Our model represents graphite electrodes through their optical dielectric spectra. The electrolyte was 1. 2. M Li salt in propylene carbonate, using the common battery anions, PF 6 -,BF 4 - and ClO 4 - We also investigated the perhalate series with BrO 4 - and IO 4. The capacitance C = dσ / dψ was calculated from the predicted electrode surface charge σ of each electrode with potential ψ between electrodes. Compared to the purely electrostatic calculation, the capacitance of a positively charged graphite electrode was enhanced by more than 15 %, with PF 6 - showing > 50 % increase in capacitance. IO 4 - provided minimal enhancement. The enhancement is due to adsorption of both anions and cations, driven by ionic dispersion forces. The Hofmeister series in the single-electrode capacitance was PF 6 ->BF 4 ->ClO 4 ->BrO 4 ->IO 4 - When the graphite electrode was negatively charged, the perhalates provided almost no enhancement of capacitance, while PF 6 - and BF 4 - decreased capacitance by about 15 %. Due to the asymmetric impact of nonelectrostatic ion interactions, the capacitances {{of positive and negative}} electrodes are not equal.

Most of the results presented here pertain to the superconductor to normal (S-N) region, although some results for the insulating to normal (I-N) region are also included. We find very good agreement between the WKB-RG and QMC results when compared to the experimental data. To fit the data, we only used the experimentally determined capacitances as fitting parameters. The WKB-RG analysis in the S-N region predicts a low temperature instability i. e. a Quantum Induced Transition (QUIT). We carefully simulations and carry out a finite size analysis of T_QUIT {{as a function of the}} magnitude of imaginary time axis L_τ. We find that for some relatively large values of α=E_C/E_J (1 ≤α≤ 2. 25), the L_τ→∞ limit does appear to give a non-zero T_QUIT, while for α> 2. 5, T_QUIT= 0. We use the SCHA to analytically understand the L_τ dependence of the QMC results with good agreement between them.
