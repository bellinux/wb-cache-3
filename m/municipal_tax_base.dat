40|$|Aiming to {{know which}} local {{characteristics}} influence the own tax revenues of municipalities in Minas Gerais, the bibliographic referential of this article versa on federalism and fiscal decentralization, indicating variables identified in the literature as determinants of <b>municipal</b> <b>tax</b> collection. The own tax revenues depends mainly on <b>municipal</b> <b>tax</b> <b>bases</b> and the rates levied on these bases. Thus, the municipality's income, {{as well as the}} weight of urban activities and the degree of formalization of economic activity, determine the size of this <b>tax</b> <b>base</b> and consequently the amount of funds raised. To analyze the local characteristics, secondary data were collected on the fiscal capacity of Minas Gerais municipalities for 2010, in view of the availability of data for this year. Was used factor analysis to group the variables, and quantile regression (RQ) to check the effect of these in different stages of Municipal Own Revenues (MOR). Were obtained three factors: "Economic Aspects"; "Structural Aspects" and "Financial Aspects", which grouped the variables according to the correlation shown between them. With the RQ could be seen that these factors affect differently the quantile MOR (q. 10, q. 25, q. 50, q. 75 and q. 90), and the highest rates are attributed to higher own tax revenues levels, demonstrating that these factors are most influential in the municipalities of higher own tax revenues.

We apply this theory {{on the level of}} all German major cities in a 10 year period from 1997 to 2006. The theoretical part gives an overview about similar applications. The empirical part firstly describes the development of the theatre, employment and population structures of these cities. Secondly, these data are used to investigate a possible connection between theatre variables and economic growth (approximated by the <b>municipal</b> net <b>tax</b> <b>base).</b> We apply a balanced panel estimation with cross-section fixed effects on the data.

40|$|Sweden has {{undertaken}} major national reforms of its school sector which, con- sequently, has been classified {{as one of}} the most decentralized ones in the OECD. This paper investigates whether school resources became more un- equally distributed across municipalities in connection with the reforms and if local tax base, grants, and preferences affected local school resources differently as decentralization took place. Using municipal data the paper studies how per pupil spending and the teacher-pupil ratio has evolved over the period 1989 – 2002, separating between three different waves of decentralization. As nothing much has happened with per pupil spending, the teacher-pupil ratio has become more evenly distributed across municipalities. <b>Municipal</b> <b>tax</b> <b>base</b> affects per pupil spending in the same way regardless of whether the school sector is cen- tralized or decentralized, but has a smaller effect on teacher-pupil ratio after the reforms.

40|$|The interim {{targets of}} the Swedish {{environmental}} quality objective “A non-toxic environment” emphasize that {{remediation of contaminated sites}} should progress at a high speed. Since remediation is an expensive venture, it is valuable to gain knowledge about where in the remediation process government funding affects the pace of progress the most. In this paper we analyze how government funding, {{in the form of a}} directed grant, affects the pace of progress in four different states of the remediation process. The estimation is performed in a simultaneous sequential duration model in which a site has to exit a state to be eligible for inclusion in the following state. We control for a number of variables that may also affect the pace of the remediation process, such as the <b>municipal</b> <b>tax</b> <b>base</b> and the site’s level of contaminants. Although there is heterogeneity between the sites that contribute to making remediation a slow process, our analyses show that the directed grant positively affects the probability of leaving the first and third states. We identify the third state (i. e., the time between the end of a thorough risk classification and the inception of on-site remediation) as the remediation process’ bottleneck. Even if the directed grant can speed up the process in this state, the effect is minuscule compared to the amount of directed grants needed to do so. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} public acquisitions of open space on house prices and the <b>municipal</b> <b>tax</b> <b>base.</b> While {{a series of studies}} show that open space acquisitions raise values of nearby properties, no research to date appears to focus upon the effect of open space acquisitions upon local tax base. Existing studies focus on the effect of open space acreage on house prices. We examine the effect of open space expenditures on house prices at the municipal level. We find that a one-dollar increase in open space expenditures per housing unit is associated with average house prices that are about $ 13 higher and with a tax base that is about $ 15 lower per acre. Open space expenditures per housing unit also show a consistent positive effect on the percentage change in house prices over the period 1995 - 2000. However, we find no statistically significant effect from open space expenditures on the percentage change in the tax base over the period 1995 - 2000. Local funding (rather than state funding) for open space has a smaller impact on house prices but the effect is significant only in some specifications. Despite the negative effect of open space purchases on the tax base, we find that higher open space expenditures are associated with lower tax rates. In addition, we find that while higher tax rates are associated with a lower tax base, a larger tax base does depress tax rates.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to examine the inter-jurisdictional and dynamic relationships between the use of the tax increment finance development tool and property taxation. Tax increment finance can move large portions of the <b>tax</b> <b>base</b> off the general fund tax rolls. Further, over time there is a reallocation of revenue streams away from the non-municipal overlying jurisdictions to the municipal government, and these resources are used to subsidize development. Over time local authorities may therefore adjust tax rates in response to changes in the <b>tax</b> <b>base.</b> Using data from nearly all Wisconsin municipalities over the 1990 - 2003 period, we find that the use of tax increment finance leads to increases in property tax rates in non-municipal overlapping jurisdictions while reducing rates in <b>municipal</b> governments. The <b>tax</b> burden reallocation appears to be temporary; non-municipal tax rates fall and <b>municipal</b> <b>tax</b> rates increase when tax increment finance districts close. This research shows that the burden of covering the tax increment finance development subsidies results in explicit changes in tax rates across jurisdictions.

40|$|This paper {{measures}} {{the impact of}} 30 Walmart openings on the <b>municipal</b> <b>tax</b> <b>base</b> using panel data for New Jersey municipalities from 1998 - 2007. We consider {{the impact of the}} new Walmart on the home municipality as well as the nearest adjacent municipality in the year the outlet opens as well as the two subsequent years. Because Walmart may exert differing effects on residential and non-residential values, we undertake separate analyses of the impact of Walmart on the residential and non-residential tax bases. We find that a new Walmart has a significant positive impact on the growth in the tax base in host municipalities the second year that it is open, but not in years one and three. In addition, the impact of the Walmart on the growth in the tax base depends {{on the size of the}} municipality. In the average-sized municipality, the real equalized tax base growth rate rises only about 0. 35 percentage points in the second year. This effect is primarily the result of Walmart’s impact on residential values in the host municipality. By contrast, a new Walmart causes a modest but consistently negative effect on growth of the tax base in the adjacent municipality across all three years that we are able to measure. In the average sized municipality for our sample, the real equalized tax base growth rate falls rate falls 0. 065, 0. 081, and 0. 096 percentage points, respectively. This effect occurs primarily through the Walmart’s impact on growth of non-residential values. The cumulative effect of this reduction in growth in the adjacent municipality is roughly two thirds of the increase in growth experienced by the home municipality. ...|$|E
