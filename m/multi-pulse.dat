40|$|Submarine {{turbidity}} currents {{are a key}} {{mechanism in}} the transportation of clastic sediments to deep seas. Such currents may initiate with a complex longitudinal flow structure comprising flow pulses (e. g. by being sourced from retrogressive sea floor slope failures) or acquire such structure during runout (e. g. following flow combination downstream of confluences). A key question is how far along channel pathway complex flow structure is preserved within turbidity currents as they run out and thus if flow initiation mechanism and proximity to source may be inferred from the vertical structure of their deposits. To address this question, physical modelling of saline flows has been conducted to investigate the dynamics of single-pulsed vs. <b>multi-pulsed</b> density driven currents. The data suggest that under most circumstances individual pulses within a <b>multi-pulsed</b> flow must merge. Therefore initiation signatures will only be preserved in deposits upstream of the merging point, and may be distorted approaching it; downstream of the merging point, all initiation signals will be lost.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the nonequilibrium dynamical properties of a weakly-interacting Bose gas at zero temperature under the <b>multi-pulsed</b> quantum quench in interaction by calculating one-body, two-body correlation functions and Tan's contact {{of the model}} system. The <b>multi-pulsed</b> quench is represented as follows: first suddenly quenching the interatomic interaction from $g_{i}$ to $g_{f}$ at time $t= 0 $, holding time $t$, and then suddenly quenching interaction from $g_{f}$ back to $g_{i}$, holding the time $t$ sequence $n$ times. In particular, two typical kinds of quenching parameters are chosen, corresponding to $(g_{i}/g_{f}> 1) $ and $(g_{i}/g_{f}< 1) $ respectively. We find that the more the quenching times of $n$ are, the more the excitations are excited, {{which suggests that the}} <b>multi-pulsed</b> QQ is more powerful way of studying the non-equilibrium dynamics of many-body quantum system than the `one-off' quantum quench. Finally, we discuss the ultra-short-range properties of the two-body correlation function after the $n$th quenching, which can be used to probe the `Tan'scontact' in experiments.

Green Satin was thus based on a simple cavity magnetron generator, rather than the more accurate traveling wave tube solutions like the klystron.

50|$|One can incoherently add the {{magnitudes}} of a {{time series}} of N-independent pulses to obtain a √N improvement in the signal to noise on the amplitude, but {{at the expense of}} losing the phase information. Instead coherent addition (adding the complex magnitude and phase) of multiple pulse waveforms would improve the signal to noise by a factor of N, not its square root, and preserve the phase information. The practical limitation is adjacent pulses from typical lasers have a minute frequency drift that translates to a large random phase shift in any long distance return signal, and thus just like the case for spatially scrambled-phase pixels, destructively interfere when added coherently. However, coherent addition of multiple pulses is possible with advanced laser systems that narrow the frequency drift far below the difference frequency (intermediate frequency).
