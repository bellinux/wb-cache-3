5|$|Declination is {{positive}} for an eastward deviation {{of the field}} relative to true north. It can be estimated by comparing the magnetic north/south heading on a compass with {{the direction of a}} celestial pole. Maps typically include information on the declination as an angle or a small diagram showing the relationship between <b>magnetic</b> <b>north</b> and true north. Information on declination for a region can be represented by a chart with isogonic lines (contour lines with each line representing a fixed declination).|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales have a {{relatively}} small brain compared to their body mass. Like other mammals, their brain has a large, folded cerebrum, {{the part of the}} brain responsible for memory and processing sensory information. Their cerebrum only makes up about 68% of their brain's weight, as opposed to human's 83%. The cerebellum, {{the part of the brain}} responsible for balance and coordination, makes up 18% of their brain's weight, compared to 10% in humans, which is probably due to the great degree of control necessary for constantly swimming. Necropsies on the brains of gray whales revealed iron oxide particles, which may allow them to find <b>magnetic</b> <b>north</b> like a compass.|$|E
5|$|By {{combining}} {{the distance between}} the aircraft and satellite, speed, and heading with aircraft performance constraints (e.g. fuel consumption, possible speeds and altitudes), investigators generated candidate paths that were analysed separately by two methods. The first assumed the aircraft was flying on one of the three autopilot modes (two are further affected by whether the navigation system used <b>magnetic</b> <b>north</b> or true north as a reference), calculated the BTO and BFO values along these routes, and compared them with the values recorded from Flight 370. The second method generated paths which had the aircraft's speed and heading adjusted at the time of each handshake to minimise the difference between the calculated BFO of the path and the values recorded from Flight 370. A probability distribution for each method at the BTO arc of the sixth handshake of the two methods was created and then compared; 80 percent of the highest probability paths for both analyses combined intersect the BTO arc of the sixth handshake between 32.5°S and 38.1°S, which can be extrapolated to 33.5°S and 38.3°S along the BTO arc of the seventh handshake.|$|E

25|$|Cartographers use a {{projection}} {{to project the}} curved {{surface of the earth}} onto a flat surface. This generates a grid that is used as a base for national topographic mapping. The projection introduces a distortion so that grid north differs from true north; <b>magnetic</b> <b>north</b> is a natural feature that differs from both. As an example: at 52° 35' N 1° 10' E (approx 7km west of Norwich, England) true north is 2° 33' west of grid north, and <b>magnetic</b> <b>north</b> is about 7° west of grid north. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>north</b> varies continually and in this example (1986) was reducing by about ½° in four years. Orienteering maps are printed using <b>magnetic</b> <b>north</b> and this requires an adjustment to be made to the base map.|$|E

30|$|The <b>north</b> <b>magnetic</b> dip pole {{velocity}} {{has more}} than doubled in the last 30 years. This observation, together with the decrease in the Earth’s magnetic dipole intensity over the last century has raised the concern of a possible approaching polarity reversal. We show that this rapid variation is in fact to be expected, and will not affect the dipolar field as a whole, but only the <b>north</b> <b>magnetic</b> pole. We demonstrate how this rapid displacement of the <b>north</b> <b>magnetic</b> pole is made possible by the horizontal field morphology. This rapid variation of <b>north</b> <b>magnetic</b> pole position does not imply any important modification of the core processes associated with field generation. The <b>north</b> <b>magnetic</b> pole position being very sensitive to small as well as rapid variations of the field, we show that it can very effectively be used as a passive tracer (or indicator) of field variations. Indeed, its velocity over the last century very accurately indicates the geomagnetic impulses (or jerks) that were so far observed only in observatory data.|$|R

25|$|Unlike a {{directional}} gyro or heading indicator, a gyrocompass seeks north.

The episode follows presenters Jeremy Clarkson and James May in their successful attempt {{to be the first}} people to reach the <b>Magnetic</b> <b>North</b> Pole in a motor vehicle.

25|$|A {{magnetic}} compass points to <b>magnetic</b> <b>north</b> pole, which is approximately 1,000 {{miles from the}} true geographic North Pole. A {{magnetic compass}}'s user can determine true North by finding the <b>magnetic</b> <b>north</b> and then correcting for variation and deviation. Variation {{is defined as the}} angle between the direction of true (geographic) north and the direction of the meridian between the magnetic poles. Variation values for most of the oceans had been calculated and published by 1914. Deviation refers to the response of the compass to local magnetic fields caused by the presence of iron and electric currents; one can partly compensate for these by careful location of the compass and the placement of compensating magnets under the compass itself. Mariners have long known that these measures do not completely cancel deviation; hence, they performed an additional step by measuring the compass bearing of a landmark with a known magnetic bearing. They then pointed their ship to the next compass point and measured again, graphing their results. In this way, correction tables could be created, which would be consulted when compasses were used when traveling in those locations.|$|E

Clarkson chooses to use a Toyota Hilux, modified for arctic conditions by Arctic Trucks, and aims to prove that Arctic exploration to the pole can be quicker and more luxurious than via traditional methods. He is reluctantly joined by co-presenter James May who is not keen {{to go to the}} pole at all.|$|E
25|$|GPS {{compasses}} {{share the}} main advantages of gyrocompasses. They determine true North, {{as opposed to}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>North,</b> and they are unaffected by perturbations of the Earth's magnetic field. Additionally, compared with gyrocompasses, they are much cheaper, they work better in polar regions, they are less prone {{to be affected by}} mechanical vibration, and they can be initialized far more quickly. However, they depend on the functioning of, and communication with, the GPS satellites, which might be disrupted by an electronic attack or by the effects of a severe solar storm. Gyrocompasses remain in use for military purposes (especially in submarines, where magnetic and GPS compasses are useless), but have been largely superseded by GPS compasses, with magnetic backups, in civilian contexts.|$|E
25|$|The Hoddle Grid is {{the layout}} of the streets in the centre of the {{original}} Melbourne City Centre. The grid was laid out in 1837 by Robert Hoddle. All major streets are one and half chains (99ft or 30m) in width, while all blocks are exactly 10 chains square (10 acres, 201m × 201m). It is one mile (1.6km) long by half a mile wide (0.80km). The grid's longest axis is oriented 70 degrees clockwise from true north, to align better with the course of the Yarra River. The majority of Melbourne is oriented at 8 degrees clockwise from true north–noting that <b>magnetic</b> <b>north</b> was 8° 3' E in 1900, increasing to 11° 42' E in 2009. It covers the area from Flinders Street to Queen Victoria Market, and from Spencer Street to Spring Street.|$|E

25|$|True north, concept of: The Song Dynasty (9601279) {{official}} Shen Kuo (10311095), {{alongside his}} colleague Wei Pu, improved the orifice {{width of the}} sighting tube to make nightly accurate records of the paths of the moon, stars, and planets in the night sky, for a continuum of five years. By doing so, Shen fixed the outdated position of the pole star, which had shifted over the centuries since the time Zu Geng (fl. 5th century) had plotted it; {{this was due to}} the precession of the Earth's rotational axis. When making the first known experiments with a magnetic compass, Shen Kuo wrote that the needle always pointed slightly east rather than due south, an angle he measured which is now known as magnetic declination, and wrote that the compass needle in fact pointed towards the <b>magnetic</b> <b>north</b> pole instead of true north (indicated by the current pole star); this was a critical step in the history of accurate navigation with a compass.|$|E
500|$|At any location, the Earth's {{magnetic}} field {{can be represented}} by a three-dimensional vector.
