40|$|Migraine is a {{debilitating}} neurological disorder with grave consequences {{for both the}} individual and society. This review will focus on recent literature investigating how brain structures implicated in reward and aversion contribute to the genesis of migraine pain. There exist many overlapping and interacting brain regions within pain and reward circuitry that contribute to negative affect and subjective experience of pain. The emotional component of pain has been argued to be a greater metric of quality of life than its sensory component, and thus understanding the processes that influence this pain characteristic is essential to developing novel treatment strategies for mitigating migraine pain. We emphasize and provide evidence that abnormalities within the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>cortical</b> reward pathways contribute to migraine pain {{and that there are}} structural and functional neuroplasticity within the overlapping brain regions common to both pain and reward. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{impacts of}} {{unpredictable}} stressors have influence on neurochemical and behavioral parameters in laboratory animals. Stress induced behavioral changes particularly {{those associated with}} anxiety like behavior may activate topographically organized <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>cortical</b> serotonergic system. This {{study was designed to}} investigate the influence of unpredictable stress on behavioral and neurochemical parameters in apomorphine treated rats. Methods: Initially, the animals were divided into two groups as Unstressed and stressed (uncontrollable chronic mild stress or UCMS). Both groups of animals were subdivided into two groups; i. e. saline and apomorphine administrated animals at dose 1. 0 mg/kg. Behavioral manipulations was observed by monitoring the locomotor activity and exploratory activity. Neurochemical estimation of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) was done by High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Animals were decapitated 24 hr post apomorphine injection and different regions of brain (dorsal and ventral striatum), of animals were collected and stored at - 70 °C. Results: This preclinical study showed that the UCMS induced hypophagia were promoted in apomorphine administrated animals. Apomorphine induced hyperlocomotion were more prominent in unstressed animals than that of stressed groups. It implies that apomorphine is effective in the retrieval from UCMS induced depressive symptoms in rats. Neurochemical study showed decreased level of 5 -HT in unstressed animals than stressed animals in response to apomorphine administration. Conclusion: This study, therefore establish the relation between stress and addiction at behavioral as well as neurochemical level to better understand the idea whether intolerable stress promotes addiction...|$|R
50|$|The {{function}} of {{lower motor neurons}} {{can be divided into}} two different groups: the lateral corticospinal tract and the anterior <b>cortical</b> spinal <b>tract.</b> The lateral tract contains upper motor neuronal axons which synapse on dorsal lateral (DL) lower motor neurons. The DL neurons are involved in distal limb control. Therefore, these DL neurons are found specifically only in the cervical and lumbosacral enlargements within the spinal cord. There is no decussation in the lateral corticospinal tract after the decussation at the medullary pyramids.|$|R
40|$|Training is {{associated}} with specific neural adaptations. Skill training {{has been associated with}} increases in corticospinal tract excitability, leading to long term adaptations within motor cortex. Neural adaptations associated with strength training are less well established. It is not known how they are affected by volume, intensity, rate of muscle activation, or rest period. We evaluated the acute neural adaptations to a single session of strength training with the goal of evaluating the influence of rate of muscle activation on neural adaptations at the cortical and spinal levels. Thirty subjects participated in a single session of maximal, isometric knee extensions with the right leg. The training consisted of 4 sets of 5 contractions, with sets separated by approximately 5 minutes. Subjects were randomized into a high rate of muscle-activation group (Ballistic), a low rate of muscle-activation group (Ramp), and a Control group that did all testing but no training. <b>Cortical</b> spinal <b>tract</b> excitability was assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation, spinal excitability was assessed using peripheral nerve stimulation, and inhibition of motor cortex was assessed using short-interval intracortical inhibition. In addition, we measured changes in motor performance. These same measures were assessed 24 hours later. Results showed that an acute strength training session {{is associated}} with a depression in resting <b>cortical</b> spinal <b>tract</b> excitability, but no change in active excitability. This change was immediate, taking place after just 2 contractions. Training was also associated with an increase in the excitability of the monosynaptic reflex circuit within the spinal cord during muscle activation, but not at rest. After 24 hours, <b>cortical</b> motor <b>tract</b> excitability had returned to normal, but intracortical inhibition was decreased from the original measure. Subjects from all groups increased maximum rate of torque development from Day 1 to Day 2. These results indicate that strength-training {{is associated with}} neural adaptations, though the adaptations were different than those for skill training. Understanding these adaptations will allow coaches and clinicians to better design programs to optimize the strength potential of the nervous system along with that of the muscles...|$|R
40|$|Preterm born {{children}} with spastic diplegia type of cerebral palsy and white matter injury or periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), {{are known to}} have motor, visual and cognitive impairments. Most diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies performed in this group have demonstrated widespread abnormalities using averaged deterministic tractography and voxel-based DTI measurements. Little is known about structural network correlates of white matter topography and reorganization in preterm cerebral palsy, despite the availability of new therapies and the need for brain imaging biomarkers. Here, we combined novel post-processing methodology of probabilistic tractography data in this preterm cohort to improve spatial and regional delineation of longitudinal <b>cortical</b> association <b>tract</b> abnormalities using an along-tract approach, and compared these data to structural DTI cortical network topology analysis. DTI images were acquired on 16 preterm {{children with}} cerebral palsy (mean age 5. 6  ±  4) and 75 healthy controls (mean age 5. 7  ±  3. 4). Despite mean tract analysis, Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) demonstrating diffusely reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) reduction in all white matter tracts, the along-tract analysis improved the detection of regional tract vulnerability. The along-tract map-structural network topology correlates revealed two associations: (1) reduced regional posterior–anterior gradient in FA of the longitudinal visual <b>cortical</b> association <b>tracts</b> (inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, optic radiation, posterior thalamic radiation) correlated with reduced posterior–anterior gradient of intra-regional (nodal efficiency) metrics with relative sparing of frontal and temporal regions; and (2) reduced regional FA within frontal–thalamic–striatal white matter pathways (anterior limb/anterior thalamic radiation, superior longitudinal fasciculus and <b>cortical</b> spinal <b>tract)</b> correlated with alteration in eigenvector centrality, clustering coefficient (inter-regional) and participation co-efficient (inter-modular) alterations of frontal–striatal and fronto-limbic nodes suggesting re-organization of these pathways. Both along tract and structural topology network measurements correlated strongly with motor and visual clinical outcome scores. This study shows the value of combining along-tract analysis and structural network topology in depicting not only selective parietal occipital regional vulnerability but also reorganization of frontal–striatal and frontal–limbic pathways in preterm children with cerebral palsy. These finding also support the concept that widespread, but selective posterior–anterior neural network connectivity alterations in preterm children with cerebral palsy likely contribute to the pathogenesis of neurosensory and cognitive impairment in this group...|$|R

40|$|Abnormal <b>mesolimbic</b> {{control of}} <b>cortical</b> {{cholinergic}} activity has been hypothesized {{to contribute to}} the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. Stimulation of NMDA receptors in nucleus accumbens (NAC) increases acetylcholine (ACh) release in prefrontal cortex (PFC), an activation thought to contribute to attentional processing. Thus, the effects of intra-NAC perfusion of NMDA (250 – 400 mM) on ACh release in PFC were determined in rats receiving lesions of the ventral hippocampus (VH) as neonates (nVHLX), a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia, or as adults (aVHLX). NMDA elevated ACh release (100 – 150 % above baseline) in adults sham–lesioned as neonates or in aVHLX rats. Adult nVHLX were unresponsive to NAC NMDA receptor stimulation. The inability of nVHLX to respond to NMDA emerged over development as a separate experiment demonstrated that evoked ACh release was normal before puberty (100 – 150 % increase) yet, in these same nVHLX animals, absent after puberty. Amphetamine-evoked ACh release was assessed in nVHLX animals to exclude potential limitations in release capacity. Amphetamine produced greater increases in ACh release than in shams, indicating that nVHLX does not impair the capacity of cholinergic neurons to release ACh. Finally, the ability of 13 days of pretreatment with clozapine (1. 25 mg/kg/day) to reinstate NMDA-evoked cortical ACh efflux was determined. Clozapine treatment normalized NMDA-evoked ACh release in nVHLX animals. These experiments show that <b>mesolimbic</b> regulation of <b>cortical</b> ACh release is disrupted in postpubertal nVHLX rats and normalized by low-dose treatment of clozapine; supporting the usefulness of nVHLX animals for research on the neuronal mechanisms underlying the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAuditory verbal {{hallucinations}} (AVH) is {{a common}} and stressful symptom of schizophrenia. Disrupted connectivity between frontal and temporo-parietal language areas, giving rise to the misattribution of inner speech, is speculated to underlie this phenomenon. Disrupted connectivity should {{be reflected in the}} microstructure of the arcuate fasciculi (AF); the main connection between frontal and temporo-parietal language areas. In this study we compared microstructural properties of the AF and three other fiber <b>tracts</b> (<b>cortical</b> spinal <b>tract,</b> cingulum and uncinate fasciculus), between 44 schizophrenia patients with chronic severe hallucinations and 42 control subjects using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetic transfer imaging (MTI). The DTI scans were used to compute fractional anisotropy (FA) and to reconstruct the fiber bundles of interest, while the MTI scans were used to compute magnetic transfer ratio (MTR) values. The patient group showed a general decrease in FA for all bundles. In the arcuate fasciculus this decreased FA was coupled to a significant increase in MTR values. A correlation was found between mean MTR values in both arcuate fasciculi and the severity of positive symptoms. The combination of decreased FA and increased MTR values observed in the arcuate fasciculi in patients suggests increased free water concentrations, probably caused by degraded integrity of the axons or the supportive glia cells. This suggests that disintegrated fiber integrity in the connection between frontal and temporo-parietal language areas in the schizophrenia patients is associated with their liability for auditory verbal hallucinations...|$|R

40|$|Percutaneous {{nephrostomy}} {{is almost}} a daily routine procedure in clinical urologic practice. Tract bleeding and urine leakage along the percutaneous tract is a common event and bothersome to both patients and the surgeon. Herein we introduce a simple technique of gelatin packing for stopping subsequent bleeding and urine leakage immediately after a percutaneous nephrostomy lithotripsy (PCNL) procedure. Methods: PCNL, using a tubeless technique, was performed in 15 patients with renal calculi. In all cases, stones were removed using grasping forceps after the stones were disintegrated with a lithoclast. In all patients, a retrograde internal ureteral stent {{was put in place}} before the PCNL procedure, as was a Foley catheter for bladder drainage. A gelatin patch sealant was placed in the nephrostomy <b>cortical</b> <b>tract</b> under nephroscopic vision, immediately after the PCNL procedure. Another 15 patients, treated using a standard PCNL with tube drainage post-PCNL, were enrolled as a control group. Results: The stone burden, mean operative time, and stone-free rate (67 % versus 73 %, p = 0. 33) were not statistically different between the 2 groups. In the 15 patients who received tubeless PCNL treatment, there were no severe complications related to the gelatin packing in the nephrostomy tract, and no significant bleeding or urine leakage occurred after the packing. The necessity for blood transfusion was much lower in the tubeless group as compared with the tube-drainage group (6. 6 % versus 26. 7 %; 0. 2 ± 0. 1 units versus 0. 9 ± 0. 5 units, p = 0. 013). Tubeless patients began ambulation and were discharged from the hospital earlier (3. 4 days versus 5. 1 days, p = 0. 035) than those in the tube-drainage group. Analgesic requirement was significantly less with the gelatin sealant technique when compared with the tube drainage group (85 ± 20 mg versus 185 ± 25 mg, p = 0. 008). Conclusion: Gelatin sealant packing is an alternative, available, and feasible method for preventing bleeding and urine leakage postoperatively in selected patients receiving tubeless PCNL...|$|R

40|$|Object. Several {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that the gross-total resection (GTR) of malignant brain tumors has a significant influence on patient survival. Frequently, however, GTR cannot be achieved because the borders between healthy brain and diseased tissue are blurred in the infiltration zones of malignant brain tumors. Especially in eloquent cortical areas, resection is frequently stopped before total removal is achieved to avoid causing neurological deficits. Interestingly, 5 -aminolevulinic acid (5 -ALA) {{has been shown to}} help visualize tumor tissue intraoperatively and, thus, can significantly improve the possibility of achieving GTR of primary malignant brain tumors. The aim {{of this study was to}} go one step further and evaluate the utility and limitations of fluorescence-guided resections of primary malignant brain tumors in eloquent cortical areas in combination with intraoperative monitoring based on multimodal functional imaging data. Methods. Eighteen patients with primary malignant brain tumors in eloquent areas were included in this prospective study. Preoperative neuroradiological examinations included MR imaging with magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE), functional MR, and diffusion tensor imaging sequences to visualize functional areas and fiber tracts. Imaging data were analyzed offline, loaded into a neuronavigational system, and used intraoperatively during resections. All patients received 5 -ALA 6 hours before surgery. Fluorescence-guided tumor resections were combined with intraoperative monitoring and cortical as well as subcortical stimulation to localize functional areas and fiber tracts during surgery. Results. Twenty-five procedures were performed in 18 consecutive patients. In 24 % of all surgeries, resection was stopped because a functional area or <b>cortical</b> <b>tract</b> was identified in the resection area or because motor evoked potential amplitudes were reduced in an area where fluorescent tumor cells were still seen intraoperatively. Gross-total resection could be achieved in 16 (64 %) of the surgeries with preservation of all functional areas and fiber tracts. In 2 patients presurgical hemiparesis became accentuated postoperatively, and 1 of these patients also suffered from a new homonymous hemianopia following a second resection. Conclusions. The authors' first results show that tumor resections with 5 -ALA in combination with intraoperative cortical stimulation have the advantages of both methods and, thus, provide additional safety for the neurosurgeon during resections of primary malignant brain tumors in eloquent areas. Nonetheless, more cases and additional studies are necessary to further prove the advantages of this multimodal strategy...|$|R
40|$|Background: DTI-based tractography is an {{increasingly}} important tool for planning brain surgery in patients suffering from brain tumours. However, there is an ongoing debate which tracking approaches yield the most valid results. Especially the use of functional localizer data such as navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) or {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) seem to improve fibre tracking data in conditions where anatomical landmarks are less informative due to tumour-induced distortions of the gyral anatomy. We here compared which of the two localizer techniques yields more plausible results with respect to mapping different functional portions of the corticospinal tract (CST) in brain tumour patients. Methods: The CSTs of 18 patients with intracranial tumours {{in the vicinity of the}} primary motor area (M 1) were investigated by means of deterministic DTI. The core zone of the tumour-adjacent hand, foot and/or tongue M 1 representation served as cortical regions of interest (ROIs). M 1 core zones were defined by both the nTMS hot-spots and the fMRI local activation maxima. In addition, for all patients, a subcortical ROI at the level of the inferior anterior pons was implemented into the tracking algorithm in order to improve the anatomical specificity of CST reconstructions. As intra-individual control, we additionally tracked the CST of the hand motor region of the unaffected, i. e., non-lesional hemisphere, again comparing fMRI and nTMS M 1 seeds. The plausibility of the fMRI-ROI- vs. nTMS-ROI-based fibre trajectories was assessed by a-priori defined anatomical criteria. Moreover, the anatomical relationship of different fibre courses was compared regarding their distribution in the anterior-posterior direction as well as their location within the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC). Results: Overall, higher plausibility rates were observed for the use of nTMS- as compared to fMRI-defined cortical ROIs (p <  0. 05) in tumour vicinity. On the non-lesional hemisphere, however, equally good plausibility rates (100 %) were observed for both localizer techniques. fMRI-originated fibres generally followed a more posterior course relative to the nTMS-based tracts (p <  0. 01) in both the lesional and non-lesional hemisphere. Conclusion: NTMS achieved better tracking results than fMRI in conditions when the <b>cortical</b> <b>tract</b> origin (M 1) was located in close vicinity to a brain tumour, probably influencing neurovascular coupling. Hence, especially in situations with altered BOLD signal physiology, nTMS seems to be the method of choice in order to identify seed regions for CST mapping in patients...|$|R
40|$|To {{demonstrate}} {{the accuracy of}} magnetic resonance tractograpghy (MRT) in localizing the <b>cortical</b> spinal <b>tract</b> (CST) close to brain tumours by using intraoperative electric subcortical stimulation. Methods: Nine patients with intraaxial brain tumours underwent neurosurgery. Planning was based on analysis of the course of streamlines compatible with the CST. After tumour removal, intraoperative MRT was reacquired. Sites at various distance from the CST were repeatedly stimulated to assess whether registered motor evoked potential (MEP) could be elicited. All patients were assessed clinically both pre- and postoperatively. Results: The motor function was preserved in all patients. In all patients intraoperative MRT demonstrated shift of the bundle position caused by the surgical procedure. The distance between the estimated intraoperative CST and the point of elicited MEP was 1 cm or less in all nine patients. At distances greater than 2 cm, no patient reported positive MEP. Conclusion: Intraoperative MRT is a reliable technique for localization of CST. In all patients MEP were elicited by direct subcortical electrical stimulation at a distance below 1 cm from the CST as represented by MRT.

40|$|Using {{experimental}} {{models of}} neurotrauma, several laboratories have demonstra-ted {{the efficacy of}} neurotrophic factors (NFs) to protect neurons from death and to support axonal regeneration. These observations raised the possibility that NFs may be effective in treating neurotrauma and neurodegenerative diseases in humans. However, clinical applications of NFs have been restricted as systemic delivery of NFs at doses sufficient to reach therapeutic concentrations and to overcome their short half-lives cause adverse effects. These limitations would be overcome if NFs were continually expressed at the target site. We tested whether local expression of NFs would induce axonal regeneration in a model of neural injury.

Interestingly, axons did not cross the midline if the CST was not lesioned suggesting that the effect of NT- 3 was dependent upon trauma-induced signals.

Clinical applications include deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of neurological movement disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor.

Treatment outcome is strongly dependent on the precise placement of the electrodes and subsequent adjustment of the stimulation settings to fine-tune the therapy. DBS is now being used for treating dystonic movement disorders, where sustained muscle contractions cause twisting and repetitive movements and/or abnormal postures.

40|$|Hyperammonemia is {{less severe}} in arginase 1 {{deficiency}} {{compared with other}} urea cycle defects. Affected patients manifest hyperargininemia and infrequent episodes of hyperammonemia. Patients typically suffer from neurological impairment with <b>cortical</b> and pyramidal <b>tract</b> deterioration, spasticity, loss of ambulation, seizures, and intellectual disability; death is less common than with other urea cycle disorders. In a mouse model of arginase I deficiency, the onset of symptoms begins with weight loss and gait instability which progresses to development of tail tremor with seizure-like activity; death typically occurs at about two weeks of life. Adeno-associated viral vector gene replacement strategies result in long-term survival of mice with this disorder. With neonatal administration of vector, the viral copy number in the liver greatly declines with hepatocyte proliferation in the first 5 weeks of life.

40|$|Mobility {{and balance}} {{impairments}} are {{a hallmark of}} multiple sclerosis (MS), affecting nearly half of patients at presentation and resulting in decreased activity and participation, falls, injuries, and reduced quality of life. A growing body of work suggests that balance impairments in people with mild MS are primarily the result of deficits in proprioception, the ability to determine body position in space {{in the absence of}} vision. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of balance disturbances in MS is needed to develop evidence-based rehabilitation approaches. The purpose of the current study was to 1) map the cortical proprioceptive pathway in-vivo using diffusion weighted imaging and 2) assess associations between proprioceptive pathway white matter microstructural integrity and performance on clinical and behavioral balance tasks. We hypothesized that people with MS (PwMS) would have reduced integrity of cerebral proprioceptive pathways, and that reduced white matter microstructure within these tracts would be strongly related to proprioceptive-based balance deficits. We found poorer balance control on proprioceptive-based tasks and reduced white matter microstructural integrity of the <b>cortical</b> proprioceptive <b>tracts</b> in PwMS compared with age-matched healthy controls. Microstructural integrity of this pathway in the right hemisphere was also strongly associated with proprioceptive-based balance control in PwMS and controls. Conversely, while white matter integrity of the right hemisphere’s proprioceptive pathway was significantly correlated with overall balance performance in healthy controls, there was no such relationship in PwMS. These results augment existing literature suggesting that balance control in PwMS may become more dependent upon 1) cerebellar-regulated proprioceptive control, 2) the vestibular system, and/or 3) the visual system...|$|R
40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is {{the most}} common adult motor neuron disease that affects ∼ 2 / 100 000 individuals each year worldwide. Patients with ALS suffer from rapidly progressive degeneration of motor neurons ultimately leading to death. The major pathological features observed in post-mortem tissue from patients with ALS are motor neuron loss, <b>cortical</b> spinal <b>tract</b> degeneration, gliosis and cytoplasmic neuronal inclusions formed by TDP- 43 or TAR DNA binding Protein with a molecular mass of 43 kDa, which are now recognized as the signature lesions of sporadic ALS. TDP- 43 possesses two RNA binding domains (RBD) and a glycine-rich C terminus classifying it with other heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins known as 2 XRBD-Gly proteins. A number of reports showed that a subset of patients with ALS possess mutations in the TDP- 43 (TARDBP) gene. This further strengthens the hypotheses that gain of toxic function or loss of function in TDP- 43 causes ALS. Currently, 29 different TARDBP missense mutations have been reported in 51 unrelated sporadic or familial ALS cases and two cases of ALS plus concomitant frontotemporal lobar degeneration with a remarkable concentration of mutations in the C-terminal glycine-rich domain of TDP- 43. As these mutations will most certainly be an invaluable tool for the design and implementation of ALS animal and cell models, as well as serve as a platform for exploring the pathobiology of TDP- 43, here we summarize the identified pathogenic TARDBP mutations and their potential impact on our understanding of the role of TDP- 43 in disease...|$|R
40|$|About a half {{a century}} has passed since {{dopamine}} {{was identified as a}} neurotransmitter, and it has been several decades since it was established that people with Parkinson's disease receive motor symptom relief from oral levodopa. Despite the evidence that levodopa can reduce motor symptoms, there has been a developing body of literature that dopaminergic therapy can improve cognitive functions in some patients but make them worse in others. Over the past two decades, several laboratories have shown that dopaminergic medications can impair the action of intact neural structures and impair the behaviors associated with these structures. In this review, we consider the evidence that has accumulated in the areas of reversal learning, motor sequence learning, and other cognitive tasks. The purported inverted‐U shaped relationship between dopamine levels and performance is complex and includes many contributory factors. The regional striatal topography of nigrostriatal denervation is a critical factor, as supported by multimodal neuroimaging studies. A patient's individual genotype will determine the relative baseline position on this inverted‐U curve. Dopaminergic pharmacotherapy and individual gene polymorphisms can affect the <b>mesolimbic</b> and prefrontal <b>cortical</b> dopaminergic functions in a comparable, inverted‐U dose‐response relationship. Depending on these factors, a patient can respond positively or negatively to levodopa when performing reversal learning and motor sequence learning tasks. These tasks may continue to be relevant as our society moves to increased technological demands of a digital world that requires newly learned motor sequences and adaptive behaviors to manage daily life activities. © 2013 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Societ...|$|R
40|$|Pyelonephritis provokes growth {{retardation}} and apoptosis in infant rat renal cortex. Childhood pyelonephritis {{is a common}} cause of renal cortical scarring and hypoplastic kidneys. To understand the mechanisms underlying the <b>cortical</b> lesions, urinary <b>tract</b> infection was induced in three-week-old rats by an intravesical infusion of E. coli, type 06 K 13 HI, a rat nephropathogenic strain. Four days after infection, histopathological examination showed marked infiltration of leukocytes in the medullary tissue adjoining the calyces and pelvis. In the cortex, signs of inflammation were found only in the cortical zone adjacent to the pelvis. No cells indicative of inflammation were observed {{in other parts of}} the cortex. Immunohistochemistry for endogenous proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) demonstrated a marked decrease in immunoreactivity in proximal tubular (PT) cells. The mitotic response of PT cells, assessed by 3 H-thymidine autoradiography, showed a highly significant decrease during the first four days after induction of the infection. Four days after infection, a transient increase in apoptotic cells was observed in cortical cells outside the inflammatory areas. No increase in apoptotic cells was detected in the cortex 10 days after infection. Only a few apoptotic cells were detected in the control kidneys. In conclusion, the data indicate that inhibition of cell proliferation and enhancement of apoptosis may contribute to the renal parenchymal loss after childhood pyelonephritis...|$|R

We aimed {{to examine the}} gray and white matter tissue changes in individuals with memory decline over a 12 -year period, who might {{be at risk for}} AD. The participants were selected from the longitudinal Maastricht Aging Study based on their scores on the verbal word learning task. A group with profound memory decline over a 12 -year period (n = 20) was identified and matched with a group that did not meet this criterion (n = 20). All of the participants underwent MRI scanning. Diffusion tensor imaging and cortical thickness analyses were performed to investigate the white and gray matter differences respectively. We found decreased white matter integrity in the memory decline group compared to the control group in frontal and parietal brain regions and in several cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical <b>tracts.</b> <b>Cortical</b> thinning in the memory decline group was found in frontal, parietal, medial temporal and occipital areas. These results showed similarities with the structural brain changes observed in early AD. Thus, not only may cognitive changes be detected years before the clinical diagnosis, but typical gray and white matter changes appear to be present in older people with memory decline as well. This suggests that a combination of cognitive decline and structural brain changes might be an ideal biomarker for AD pathogenesis. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers...|$|R
40|$|Adult {{survivors}} of childhood posterior fossa tumors can experience reading difficulties related to white matter integrity. Previously, reading {{was shown to}} be related to <b>cortical</b> white matter <b>tracts,</b> however information transfer across the corpus callosum (CC) may also play a role in reading. The current study used both macro- and microstructural measures of the WM structure of the corpus callosum. The current study examined how white matter volume and fractional anisotropy (FA) in five divisions of the CC was related to degree of neurological risk and reading skill, and tested two mediation models predicting reading. Participants included 20 adult {{survivors of}} childhood posterior fossa tumor and 23 healthy controls. Volume and FA were measured in five divisions of the mid-sagittal corpus callosum. Total intracranial vault was used as a covariate in volume analyses. FA was reduced in CC 1 and volume was reduced in each subregion in survivors. Volume but not FA was related to degree of neurological risk. Results identified that reduced volume in CC 1 and CC 5, and FA in CC 5 appear to be specifically related to reading skill in line with the cortical reading regions that connect in these subregions of the CC. Mediation models indicate that processing speed is the mechanism by which volume is related to reading skill. These findings have implications for addressing processing speed in reading interventions in survivors and provide insight into the interhemispheric connections in the reading network...|$|R
40|$|AbstractStructural {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) studies using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) have been inconsistent in demonstrating impairments in gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) structures in bipolar disorder (BD). This may be a consequence of significant confounding effects of medication, illness history and selection of controls in existing studies. Study of bipolar II or not-otherwise-specified (BD II/NOS) disorder provides a solution to these confounds and a bridge to unipolar cases across the affective spectrum. Thirty-eight euthymic, antipsychotic- and mood stabilizer-naïve young adults (mean age= 20. 9 years) with BD II/NOS and 37 age-, cognitive ability- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent MRI. Voxel-wise and regional gray matter volume comparisons were conducted using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) {{were used to assess}} whole-brain WM, as indexed using fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), parallel and perpendicular diffusion values. No between-group differences were observed for whole-brain VBM comparisons. By contrast, in comparison to HCs, participants with BD II/NOS had significant widespread reductions in FA and increased MD and perpendicular diffusion values in virtually all the major <b>cortical</b> white matter <b>tracts.</b> These data suggest pathophysiological involvement of WM microstructures – but not GM macrostructures – in high functioning BD II/NOS patients at an early age and before significant clinical adversity has been recorded. We propose that white matter development is a valid candidate target for understanding genetic and environmental antecedents to bipolar disorder and mood disorder more generally...|$|R

Based on theories of brain development, it was expected that environmental factors would impact children 2 ̆ 7 s tract based differences and behavioral differences. A sample of 30 internationally adopted children and 12 comparison children participated in functional and structural imaging and a neuropsychological evaluation. For internationally adopted children frontal-cortical connectivity showed patterns of diffuse and low connectivity, whereas medial-temporal cortical connectivity showed patterns of diffuse and 2 ̆ 2 normal 2 ̆ 2 connectivity. Patterns of cortical connectivity were related several specific tract based differences and rates of internalizing problems. Tract based differences were the best indictor of emotional, behavioral, and executive functioning, with differed for the right medial-temporal to anterior- temporal, left medial-temporal to frontal, and left striatal-frontal <b>tracts.</b> <b>Cortical</b> connectivity differences were associated with length of time in adoptive home, but only for the medial-temporal tract. The results of this study support the theories of experience-expectant and experiences dependent learning. The results of this study also support the use of inter-individual connectivity differences over whole group differences in understanding the impact of early deprivation on brain architecture and behavioral functioning.

Exposure to urban air pollution has been associated with poorer cognitive performance, which is thought to be a result of direct interference with brain maturation. We aimed to assess the extent of such potential effects of urban pollution on child brain maturation using general indicators of vehicle exhaust measured in the school environment and a comprehensive imaging evaluation. A group of 263 children, aged 8 to 12 years, underwent MRI to quantify regional brain volumes, tissue composition, myelination, <b>cortical</b> thickness, neural <b>tract</b> architecture, membrane metabolites, functional connectivity in major neural networks and activation/deactivation dynamics during a sensory task. A combined measurement of elemental carbon and NO 2 was used as a putative marker of vehicle exhaust. Air pollution exposure was associated with brain changes of a functional nature, with no evident effect on brain anatomy, structure or membrane metabolites. Specifically, a higher content of pollutants was associated with lower functional integration and segregation in key brain networks relevant to both inner mental processes (the default mode network) and stimulus-driven mental operations. Age and performance (motor response speed) both showed the opposite effect to that of pollution, thus indicating that higher exposure is associated with slower brain maturation. In conclusion, urban air pollution appears to adversely affect brain maturation in a critical age with changes specifically concerning the functional domain.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{origin of}} {{auditory}} hallucinations, which {{are one of}} the core symptoms of schizophrenia, is still a matter of debate. It has been hypothesized that alterations in connectivity between frontal and parietotemporal speech-related areas might contribute to the pathogenesis of auditory hallucinations. These networks are assumed to become dysfunctional during the generation and monitoring of inner speech. Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging is a relatively new in vivo method to investigate the directionality of <b>cortical</b> white matter <b>tracts.</b> OBJECTIVE: To investigate, using diffusion tensor imaging, whether previously described abnormal activation patterns observed during auditory hallucinations relate to changes in structural interconnections between the frontal and parietotemporal speech-related areas. METHODS: A 1. 5 T magnetic resonance scanner was used to acquire twelve 5 -mm slices covering the Sylvian fissure. Fractional anisotropy was assessed in 13 patients prone to auditory hallucinations, in 13 patients without auditory hallucinations, and in 13 healthy control subjects. Structural magnetic resonance imaging was conducted in the same session. Based on an analysis of variance, areas with significantly different fractional anisotropy values between groups were selected for a confirmatory region of interest analysis. Additionally, descriptive voxel-based t tests between the groups were computed. RESULTS: In patients with hallucinations, we found significantly higher white matter directionality in the lateral parts of the temporoparietal section of the arcuate fasciculus and in parts of the anterior corpus callosum compared with control subjects and patients without hallucinations. Comparing patients with hallucinations with patients without hallucinations, we found significant differences most pronounced in the left hemispheric fiber tracts, including the cingulate bundle. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that during inner speech, the alterations of white matter fiber tracts in patients with frequent hallucinations lead to abnormal coactivation in regions related to the acoustical processing of external stimuli. This abnormal activation may account for the patients' inability to distinguish self-generated thoughts from external stimulation...|$|R
