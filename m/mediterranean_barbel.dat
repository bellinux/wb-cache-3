40|$|Abstract. The fish {{assemblage}} and limnological features along twelve {{sites from}} the Terri River basin (Catalonia, Spain) were sampled quarterly from August 1999 to May 2000. Twelve fish species were captured, of which four were native and eight exotic. Correspondence analy-sis revealed that spatial variation accounted {{for most of}} the variation (73. 7 %) in fish species composition. The upstream, urban area was dominated by chub (Leuciscus cephalus) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) with some exotic species coming from nearby Lake Banyoles, whereas <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>barbel</b> (Barbus meridionalis) predominated {{in the rest of the}} Terri River.

40|$|Top {{predator}} loss {{is a major}} global problem, with {{a current}} trend in biodiversity loss towards high trophic levels that modifies most ecosystems worldwide. Most {{research in this area}} is focused on large-bodied predators, despite the high extinction risk of small-bodied freshwa-ter fish that often act as apex consumers. Consequently, it remains unknown if intermittent streams are affected by the consequences of top-predators ’ extirpations. The aim of our re-search was to determine how this global problem affects intermittent streams and, in partic-ular, if the loss of a small-bodied top predator (1) leads to a ‘mesopredator release’, affects primary consumers and changes whole community structures, and (2) triggers a cascade effect modifying the ecosystem function. To address these questions, we studied the top-down effects of a small endangered fish species, Barbus meridionalis (the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>barbel),</b> conducting an enclosure/exclosure mesocosm experiment in an intermittent stream where B. meridionalis became locally extinct following a wildfire. We found that top predator absence led to ‘mesopredator release’, and also to ‘prey release ’ despite intraguild preda-tion, which contrasts with traditional food web theory. In addition, B. meridionalis extirpatio...|$|E
40|$|Although sewage {{treatment}} plants (STPs) {{play a crucial}} role in maintaining the water quality and flow of Mediterranean rivers, particularly during drought periods, few studies have addressed their impact on aquatic fauna. Here we analyzed the role of STPs as a source of metals in the Ripoll River, a heavily urbanized and industrialized watercourse with a long history of anthropogenic disturbance. For this purpose, we measured iron, mercury, cadmium, zinc, lead, nickel and copper accumulation in the liver and muscle of the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>barbel,</b> Barbus meridionalis and also the concentrations of these metals in the river water. Industrial and urban {{sewage treatment}} plants are source of metals in Ripoll River but the former mainly increases Zn and Ni values. Significant differences in metal bioaccumulation between reference and polluted sites were detected. Nevertheless, there was only a significant positive relationship between bioaccumulation of Cu and Hg, and their concentration in water. In addition, the lead concentration in fish was not clearly associated with the presence of STPs. On the basis of morphometric parameters, the hepato-somatic index was the only one denoting significant differences between polluted and references sites. Given that fish are key elements in food webs, recreational fishing is practice in this area and that river water is used for agricultural purposes, we recommend long-term studies to analyze the impact of metal pollution in this river...|$|E
40|$|Hydrologic {{alteration}} is a {{major threat}} to freshwater biota, and particularly fish, in many river courses around the world. We analyzed and compared the effects of water abstraction on two threatened cyprinid fishes of contrasting ecology (the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>barbel</b> Barbus meridionalis and the Catalan chub Squalius laietanus) in a Mediterranean stream. We compared abundance, size-structure, growth, and condition of both species across perennial and artificially intermittent reaches affected by water abstraction. Both species were less abundant, had scarce large individuals, and displayed slower growth rates (length-at-age) in intermittent reaches, showing clear detrimental effects of water diversion. Mixed-effect models of scale increments showed variation among individuals and among sites, years and age classes for both species. The larger-sized, water-column species (chub) disappeared or was rare in many intermittent reaches. The barbel present in intermittent reaches showed better somatic condition than in sites with permanent flow, perhaps due to reduced competition after rewetting or colonization by better fitted individuals. This benthic, rheophilic species seems more resilient to moderate water abstraction than chub. Many effects of water flow intermittency were only detected on fish life-history traits when accounting for natural, often non-linear, variation, along upstream-downstream gradients. Our results suggest that abundance was the strongest indicator of effects of water abstraction on fish populations, whereas condition was a more labile trait, rapidly recovering from anthropogenic disturbanc...|$|E
40|$|Mediterranean streams are characterised by {{seasonal}} droughts, {{the frequency}} and intensity of which vary spatially {{and are expected to}} increase with global change. We studied the potential effects of drought and climate change on the fish assemblage and its trophic ecology in a Mediterranean stream by comparing an intermittent tributary with two more permanent neighbouring reaches. Although the three sites were dominated by the same two fish species, <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>barbel</b> (Barbus meridionalis) and chub (Squalius laietanus), the intermittent tributary had a lower overall fish density and fewer eel (Anguilla anguilla). The intermittent tributary had macroinvertebrates with lower density, smaller taxa and higher diversity. Fish in the intermittent tributary had significantly lower biomasses in their gut contents (adjusted for fish length) and more negative electivities than those in the permanent reaches, as well as significantly lower taxonomic diversity. These results indicate that there was reduced resource availability in the intermittent tributary, which resulted in significantly lower condition and gonadal weight (adjusted for length) of barbel and chub. The data obtained in this Mediterranean stream support the observation that reduced water flow may affect fish at both individual and assemblage levelsThis study was financially supported by projects CGL 2007 - 65549 /BOS, CGL 2008 - 05618 -C 02 - 02, CGL 2009 - 12877 -C 02 - 01 and Consolider-Ingenio 2010 CSD 2009 - 00065 of the Spanish Ministry of Science.

40|$|Mediterranean Rivers have {{experienced}} a long-history of anthropogenic impacts. Water pollution {{is still one of}} the major threats to freshwater biota despite the marked investments in sewage treatment plants (STPs) in recent decades. This is attributed, in part, to the reduced water flow of these systems due to climate and water abstractions, coupled to some illegal spills and agricultural run-off. The present study examined the potential effects of the effluents from urban and industrial STPs on the trophic ecology of the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>barbel</b> (Barbus meridionalis) and the Ebro chub (Squalius laietanus) in a small Mediterranean stream. Fish were collected in summer 2012 and their gut contents were compared between three reference and three polluted sites and related to the water quality. In all sampling sites, the composition of prey consumed by both fish species was compatible with ommivory, including macro-invertebrates, plants and detritus. However, the two fish species ingested a higher richness and diversity prey in the baseline compared to the polluted sites. These differences were also mirrored in the taxonomic composition of preys consumed, reflecting the replacement of sensitive species with tolerant ones along a pollution gradient. Specifically, fish diet was dominated in reference sites by water beetles and plant matter, whereas two typical representatives of polluted waters, snails and chironomids, were the predominant prey type downstream the STPs inputs. No major differences in richness, diversity and taxonomic composition were observed in the prey consumed within polluted or reference sites. Our results are consistent with the generalist trophic ecology of native cyprinids in Mediterranean rivers, and suggest a similar trophic position for B. meridionalis and S. laietanus. However, differences in the taxonomic composition of prey consumed between polluted and reference sites suggest that STP inputs may have altered the energy fluxes in this Mediterranean stream...|$|E
40|$|Hydroelectricity is {{increasingly}} used worldwide {{as a source}} of renewable energy, and many mountain ranges have dozens or hundreds of hydropower plants, with many more being under construction or planned. Although the ecological impacts of large dams are relatively well known, the effects of small hydropower plants and their weirs have been much less investigated. We studied the effects of water diversion of small hydropower plants on fish assemblages in the upper Ter river basin (Catalonia, NE Spain), which has headwater reaches with good water quality and no large dams but many of such plants. We studied fish populations and habitat features on control and impacted reaches for water diversion of 16 hydropower plants. In the impacted reaches, there was a significantly lower presence of refuges for fish, poorer habitat quality, more pools and less riffles and macrophytes, and shallower water levels. We also observed higher fish abundance, larger mean fish size and better fish condition in the control than in impacted reaches, although the results were species-specific. Accordingly, species composition was also affected, with lower relative abundance of brown trout (Salmo trutta) and Pyrenean minnow (Phoxinus bigerri) in the impacted reaches and higher presence of stone loach (Barbatula quignardi) and <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>barbel</b> (Barbus meridionalis). Our study highlights the effects of water diversion of small hydropower plants from the individual to the population and community levels but probably underestimates them, urging for further assessment and mitigation of these ecological impactsThis study was financed by the Catalan Water Agency (ACA), Government of Catalonia (CTN 1001569).

40|$|Les deux espèces de barbeaux de France s'hybrident spontanément dans {{plusieurs}} bassins. Les modalités de cette hybridation ont été recherchées au travers de nombreuses études relevant de disciplines différentes (biogéographie, éthologie, génétique et parasitologie). Cet article se veut une synthèse des différents travaux consacrés à cette hybridation en même temps qu'une caractérisation de l'état de l'hybridation dans toute la France. The aim of {{this publication}} is double : one is to gather all the different studies concerning the hybridization between the common barbel and the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>barbel</b> for setting off the mechanisms of this hybridization; second is to collect from different searchers unpublished data about these two species {{in order to have}} an idea of the extent of this hybridization in France. These two species, Barbus barbus and Barbus meridionalis, are quite different morphologically (figure 1) and ecologically. The former lives in large rivers with a strong current whereas the second one can live in small mountain tributaries. In southern France, hybridization occurs in few rivers. The sampled fish were analysed by electrophoresis on horizontal starch gels at ten diagnostic loci. A genetic hybrid index (Gl) corresponding conventionally to the percentage of meridionalis genes in an individual or a population was calculated. A hybrid zone has been identified in the Lergue river, near Montpellier, by the presence of enzymatic clines (figure 3). The presence of sharp enzymatic clines and linkage disequilibrium indicate that this hybrid zone is a tension zone, in which a balance between selection and dispersal maintains the clines. Parasitical studies, using a natural specific parasite of Barbus meridionalis as genetic marker, have demonstrated the importance of the behaviour of fish for being infested or not, and so, for hybrid zone stability. Other studies in natura or in aquaria have shown too the existence of ecological differences between the two species and their hybrids. Paleontological evidences suggest that the two species only came into contact since last glaciation, date of the arrival from the nearest catchment area of Barbus barbus in Hérault basin. A map showing the extent of hybridization between the two species in France is given (figure 2). All these results are used for trying to understand how this hybridization is functioning...|$|E
40|$|Flow {{regimes are}} {{important}} drivers of both stream community and biogeochemical processes. However, {{the interplay between}} community and biogeochemical responses under different flow regimes in streams is less understood. In this study, we investigated the structural and functional responses of periphyton and macroinvertebrates to different densities of the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>barbel</b> (Barbus meridionalis, Cyprinidae) in two stream reaches differing in flow regime. The {{study was conducted in}} Llémena Stream, a small calcareous Mediterranean stream with high nutrient levels. We selected a reach with permanent flow (permanent reach) and another subjected to flow regulation (regulated reach) with periods of flow intermittency. At each reach, we used in situ cages to generate 3 levels of fish density. Cages with 10 barbels were used to simulate high fish density (> 7 ind m − 2); cages with open sides were used as controls (i. e. exposed to actual fish densities of each stream reach) thus having low fish density; and those with no fish were used to simulate the disappearance of fish that occurs with stream drying. Differences in fish density did not cause significant changes in periphyton biomass and macroinvertebrate density. However, phosphate uptake by periphyton was enhanced in treatments lacking fish in the regulated reach with intermittent flow but not in the permanent reach, suggesting that hydrologic alteration hampers the ability of biotic communities to compensate for the absence of fish. This study indicates that fish density can mediate the effects of anthropogenic alterations such as flow intermittence derived from hydrologic regulation on stream benthic communities and associated biogeochemical processes, at least in eutrophic streamsThis research was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (projects CGL 2013 - 43822 -R and CGL 2016 - 80820 -R); the Government of Catalonia (ref. 2014 SGR 484 and CERCA Programme) and the University of Girona (ref.
