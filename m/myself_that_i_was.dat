500|$|If we {{stick to}} the Faust story – if I had been in that story – and I had sold my soul [...] for fame and fortune, and had the arrogance of [...] to not want {{to pay back the}} deal, it's taken a few years for me to {{acknowledge}} to <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> hearing: 'Manson , the hell hounds are on your trail.' And this record is my payment. This is me giving back what I was given, or took. [...] If you believe in some mythology, and you want to live by those rules, then I had to say myself: 'I'm not really doing what I set out to do,' even though I tried to convince <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> I'm not regretting the last few records that I've made, but since Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death), I've not made something with [...] sheer utter fearlessness and anger and force.|$|E
500|$|Somewhat {{overshadowed by}} Henderson's winning goal, was a four-point game by Phil Esposito, two goals and two assists, and {{a hand in}} all three goals of the third period. Esposito was the only player on either team to score four points in a game during the series. According to Ron Ellis, he had [...] "never seen another player have a period where {{there was so much}} {{pressure}} and was still able to accomplish what he did." [...] Sinden considered it to be Esposito's [...] "finest hour." [...] Esposito describes it as [...] "there was no stopping me. And I think some of the guys got a little angry with me. If we had lost, I would have been the goat. But we didn't lose. I just had enough faith in <b>myself,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to get it done, one way or another." ...|$|E
2500|$|Moore {{spent the}} next three years {{drifting}} between various odd jobs and temporary work. As Moore himself recounted in the book, Star Trek: The Next Generation 365, by the fall of 1986, he was [...] "less than a year into my career as a college dropout ... working as a medical records technician (otherwise known as a receptionist) at an animal hospital, all the while telling <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> actually a professional writer simply awaiting my inevitable discovery." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I want,' said Lucy, all {{tragedy and}} no comedy, 'to {{know why you}} talk of my {{flattering}} <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> insulted, and my plans upset.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know," [...] said he, {{a little}} nettled, [...] "I draw tolerably--should {{do it at}} least--have had good masters, and flatter <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not quite a blockhead." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{a private}} paper written in his sixties, Eliot confessed: [...] "I came to persuade <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{in love with}} Vivienne simply because I wanted to burn my boats and commit myself to staying in England. And she persuaded herself (also under the {{influence}} of [...] Pound) that she would save the poet by keeping him in England. To her, the marriage brought no happiness. To me, it brought the state of mind out of which came The Waste Land." ...|$|E
2500|$|Slug also dislikes some of {{the songs}} that he wrote before and does not perform them live, such as [...] "Vampires" [...] from 2002 album God Loves Ugly. Daley has stated, [...] "when I did get my phase of trying to figure myself out, {{there was a lot}} of tug-of-war inside of me between wanting to hate a {{particular}} woman and then feeling guilty about that. And there’s certain songs that I won’t perform anymore, because the game of tug-of-war is over and I know where I’m at". Furthermore, Slug has criticized Atmosphere's first album Overcast!, saying: [...] "It's obvious that I’m trying so fucking hard on Overcast and you can see through it and tell it's not a person it's more of an attempt at trying to fill the niche, it was like I was trying to prove to <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a rapper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was," [...] he admitted, [...] "and I flatter <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> able to {{make the}} speech which settled your chances in that direction." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{must teach}} you;--we really must teach you. I think I may boast of <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a good {{instructor}} in that line. Will {{you promise to}} put yourself into my hands?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Augusta!" [...] said he, faintly, as, after a {{long and}} quiet sleep, he awoke free from delirium. She bent over him. [...] "Augusta, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> redeemed--I am saved--I feel in <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> made whole." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then how can I not hope? Violet, I {{would if}} I {{could tell you}} all my {{feelings}} plainly. Once, twice, thrice, I have said to <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would think of you no more. I have tried to persuade <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> better single than married." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Where can I get a {{horse and}} vehicle?" [...] I asked quickly, so much enraged with <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> glad to have some one to direct my movements.|$|E
6000|$|Harry meditated. [...] "Well, I am {{not quite}} sure about that, Dick; but then, you see, I was never quite sure <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in earnest, and that's rather a drawback, you know." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{is exactly}} what {{happened}} after I regained the house. I went upstairs for a few minutes to arrange my hair and bathe my eyes. Then I walked straight down to the drawing-room, and I told <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> prepared for anything that might take place.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh don't be modest," [...] Newman answered, laughing. [...] "I can't flatter <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{doing so}} well simply by my own merit. And thank your mother for me, too!" [...] And he turned away, leaving M. de Bellegarde looking after him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you sure," [...] she asked, fixing her {{brilliant}} eyes upon him, [...] "that {{he needs}} your sympathy? He {{is very much}} in love with me, and there <b>are</b> times when <b>I</b> could almost persuade <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in love with him. At any rate, he attracts me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't do much towards {{making them}} fat myself," [...] replied Turnbull, genially, [...] "but <b>I</b> flatter <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> now doing {{something}} towards making them thin. You'll see {{they will be}} as lean as rakes {{by the time they}} catch us. They will look like your friend, Cardinal Manning." ...|$|R
60|$|My self-communion as I {{walked away}} from his door, trying {{to believe that this}} was for the last time, was not satisfactory. I was aware <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not sincere in my {{reflections}} as to Jacobus's motives, and, of course, the very next day I went back again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank {{you very}} much, count. I wrote {{to you before}} I started, but I have had no {{opportunity}} of thanking you, personally, for those splendid animals. Sorry as I was to lose the horse I rode at Lobositz, I congratulated <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not riding one of yours." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{a moment}} more perhaps I should have persuaded <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> one, {{but at this}} {{juncture}} I heard a sound hostile to the romantic note. It was {{nothing less than the}} substantial tread of Célestine, the cook, who stood grinning at us as we turned about from our colloquy.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is through}} charity, as usual," [...] {{she said in}} a low voice. [...] "If your {{conscience}} be quiet, mine is not. It <b>is</b> in <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> disappointed--I have <b>been</b> very selfish. <b>I</b> have usurped you. I have known it all along, and I have done very wrong in not relinquishing you before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'May you never! I cannot {{disguise}} from <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a slave, and a wretched one, {{and that}} his career has entailed this curse of servitude upon me. But away with this! You must think me, Miss Temple, the most egotistical of human beings; and yet, to do myself justice, I never remember having spoken of myself so much before.' ...|$|R
6000|$|MY HONOURED FRIEND,--It {{gives me}} a secret comfort to observe in <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not yet so far gone as Willie Gaw's Skate, [...] "past redemption;" [...] for I have still this {{favourable}} symptom of grace, that when my conscience, {{as in the case}} of this letter, tells me <b>I</b> <b>am</b> leaving something undone <b>that</b> <b>I</b> ought to do, it teases me eternally till I do it.|$|R
60|$|In {{a moment}} more, perhaps, I should have persuaded <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> one, {{but at this}} {{juncture}} I heard a sound that was not romantic. It {{proved to be the}} very realistic tread of Celestine, the cook, who stood grinning at us as we turned about from our colloquy.|$|E
60|$|Nearer and nearer {{drew the}} dreaded hour in which I felt that I must leave Canaples. On {{the last day}} of April I essayed a fencing bout with Andrea, and so strong and supple did I prove <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> forced to realise that the time was come. On the morrow I would go.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have often}} bitterly reproached <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> unable {{to share your}} fate. You are still young, and I am {{old enough to be}} your father. I am unmarried, with no {{particular}} ties in the world. You have given me new interest in life. It will be a great pleasure for me to watch your career.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was proof}} of his {{essential}} charm that Leonora not only endured his renewed harping on this harsh string, but encouraged him to continue. [...] "I know you chafe," [...] she said. [...] "I had <b>that</b> feeling till <b>I</b> began my course in cooking, and just to assure <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not entirely useless and helpless in the world, I'm now going in for a training as a nurse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't for <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> proud {{with other}} people. But I would {{rather die than}} bring ridicule upon one I--upon you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is not of}} <b>myself</b> alone <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> thinking. Everything {{matters to}} one in your profession," [...] she {{reminded}} him pointedly.|$|R
60|$|I {{was angry}} with myself that I {{permitted}} {{that matter to}} affect me as it had. I {{did not wish to}} admit to <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> angry with this uncultured little savage, that it made the slightest difference to me what she did or what she did not do, or that I could so lower myself as to feel personal enmity towards a common sailor. And yet, to be honest, I was doing both.|$|E
60|$|But, to {{tell the}} truth, it was not of these matters of high policy, which were {{far enough away from}} a humble youth like <b>myself,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> thinking. What appealed to me and made my heart sick was the {{reflection}} that if Henri Marais and his friends trekked, Marie Marais must perforce trek with them; and that whereas I, an Englishman, could not be of that adventurous company, Hernando Pereira both could and would.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sirs," [...] he said, [...] "let us {{drink to}} the health of Mistress Marjory Forbes, one of the bravest and truest of Scotch women. Would to Heaven that all the men of our country were {{animated}} by as noble and courageous feelings! Our friend, Sir Archibald Forbes, has indeed won a jewel, and I take no small credit to <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the first who advised him to make Mistress Kerr his wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sometimes I become {{afraid of}} my own generalizations upon the massed misery of this Ghetto life, and feel that my {{impressions}} <b>are</b> exaggerated, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{too close to the}} picture and lack perspective. At such moments I find it well to turn to the testimony of other men to prove to <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not becoming over-wrought and addle-pated. Frederick Harrison has always struck me as being a level-headed, well-controlled man, and he says:- ...|$|R
500|$|Pinkerton {{is named}} after the {{character}} BF Pinkerton from Madama Butterfly, who marries a Japanese woman named Butterfly. Calling him an [...] "asshole American sailor similar to a touring rock star", Cuomo felt the character was [...] "the perfect symbol for the part of <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{trying to come to}} terms with on this album." [...] Other titles considered included Playboy and Diving into the Wreck (after a poem by Adrienne Rich).|$|R
6000|$|This sort of coyness was to {{have been}} expected, and he {{therefore}} continued with another portion of his prepared words, which now came glibly enough to him. But it was a previous portion. It was all the same to Miss Thoroughbung, as it declared plainly the gentleman's intention. [...] "If I can induce you to listen to me favorably, I shall say of <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> the happiest gentleman in Hertfordshire." ...|$|R
