5|$|Neither Wetherby nor Clements {{enjoyed the}} support of Governor Chandler. Coupled with this, Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson {{suffered}} a heart attack during the campaign, and as majority whip, Clements assumed the role of acting majority leader. This took him away from the campaign trail for extended periods of time. During the infrequent visits he was able to <b>make</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state, he campaigned for his former lieutenant governor, Wetherby. In the general election, Cooper defeated Wetherby by 65,000 votes and Clements lost to Thruston Ballard Morton by about 7,000 votes. It was the first time Clements had lost a race in thirty years, and Kentucky Democrats would not elect a senator again for another sixteen years.|$|E

25|$|The {{proceeds}} of most bank loans {{are not in}} the form of currency. Banks typically make loans by accepting promissory notes in exchange for credits they <b>make</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> borrowers' deposit accounts.

Issuing loan proceeds in the form of paper currency and current coins is considered to be a weakness in internal control.|$|E
25|$|In 1860, the {{following}} year, FitzRoy introduced {{a system of}} hoisting storm warning cones at the principal ports when a gale was expected. He ordered fleets to stay in port under these conditions. The Weather Book, which he published in 1863, was far {{in advance of the}} scientific opinion of the time.

25|$|The hoard {{was sold}} by the farmer, J.L.Gibson, to a {{jeweller}} in Derry who sold it to a local antiquarian, Robert Day. He sold it to the British Museum for £600. The museum had undisturbed ownership until the renowned Arthur Evans wrote a paper describing the find in 1897. The drawing of the torc design comes from this paper. The Royal Irish Academy disputed the British Museum's view {{that it was an}} ancient gift to the gods and launched a long running court case. The Academy wanted the finds to be declared treasure trove, that is, buried with the intention of recovery. Day, the antiquarian, was so aggrieved to have his sale disputed that he withdrew a gift he was going to <b>make</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Irish Academy.|$|E
25|$|While {{returning}} to Germany from Brazil in October 1933, the Graf Zeppelin stopped at Miami (NAS Opa Locka) {{and then in}} Akron, Ohio where it visited the Goodyear-Zeppelin Company's massive airdock before proceeding to the Century of Progress World’s Fair in Chicago. After circling over the fair and landing for a brief 25-minute visit there, the Graf then returned to Akron for two days before leaving for Friedrichshafen with an overnight stop in Sevilla, Spain. The United States Post Office Department issued a special 50-cent airmail stamp (C-18) to commemorate the visit. Many of these stamps were used to frank souvenir mail carried on the Graf on its return flight to Germany. The visit was also to be the fifth and final one that the LZ 127 would <b>make</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States.|$|E

25|$|By {{the start}} of September, the Royalist {{garrison}} of Southsea Castle consisted of only a dozen men. On the night of 4 September, a Parliamentarian force of 400 infantry equipped with ladders and backed by cavalry set out to attack the castle. Although the force was spotted and fired on by the guns of Portsmouth, {{they were able to}} <b>make</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> seaward side of the castle. Simultaneously, a small party approached the main gate and called on the castle to surrender. Captain Challoner was at the time somewhat inebriated and asked them to come back in the morning. At around this time, the guns of Portsmouth once more opened fire on the assaulting force, and the Parliamentarians responded by scaling the walls and capturing the castle without further opposition. A significant Parliamentarian garrison was then installed in the castle to keep it from being recaptured.|$|E

500|$|Continuation Bond author Raymond Benson {{notes that}} two of the stories ("Quantum of Solace" [...] and [...] "The Hildebrand Rarity") are {{experimental}} for Fleming, whilst the remaining three are straightforward Bond adventures. In the two experimental stories Bond is given something of a more human side, with [...] "Quantum of Solace" [...] evidencing Bond's reaction to the Governor's story by showing a compassionate side, as he sees the real life of Philip Masters and Rhoda Llewellyn as being more dramatic than his recent mission; the forthcoming trip he has to <b>make</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> CIA, he now sees as [...] "dull and unexciting". In [...] "The Hildebrand Rarity", Bond is also shown with a humanitarian side, with feelings for the plight of Liz at the hands of her husband and {{for the use of the}} poison on the fish by Milton Krest.|$|E

His partner Glen Morgan had a similar opinion, calling it [...] "a little too ordinary, like you have seen it before, which is exactly what the network wanted at the time. Chris Carter had a more positive view of the episode, calling it [...] "very well done, really great effects, and more of a meat-and-potatoes kind of story. An FBI sting and a good mystery that Mulder and Scully investigate. Overall, a really solid episode." [...] The plot for [...] "Shadows" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 2000 by Ellen Steiber, under the title Haunted.|$|E

In an ASCII Media Works poll in which fans voted selected whose video game or manga character would like to name their children after, Sora's name was second in the male category. In a Famitsu poll from 2011, Sora was voted as the most popular Kingdom Hearts character, with his fight against Roxas from Kingdom Hearts II also being listed as the best scene from the series.

500|$|In the show's twenty seasons, Stan has {{addressed}} other {{topics such as}} homosexuality, hate crime legislation, civil liberties, parenting, illegal immigration, voting, alcoholism, and race relations. His commentary on these issues have been interpreted as statements Parker and Stone are attempting to <b>make</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> viewing public, and these opinions {{have been subject to}} much critical analysis in the media and literary world. The book [...] includes an essay in which East Carolina University philosophy professor Henry Jacoby compares Stan's actions and reasoning within the show to the philosophical teachings of William Kingdon Clifford, and another essay by Southern Illinois University philosophy professor John S. Gray which references Stan's decision to not vote for either candidate for a school mascot in the season eight (2004) episode [...] "Douche and Turd" [...] when describing political philosophy and the claimed pitfalls of a two-party system. Essays in the books , Blame Canada!

500|$|The New Zealanders {{travelled}} to New York City, {{where they}} played an exhibition game, {{then on to}} San Francisco. There they played two official matches against British Columbia, and won both easily. The tour programme thus ended; New Zealand had played 35 games and lost only once. Gallaher had played in 26 of those matches, including four Tests. Over their 32 matches in the British Isles New Zealand scored 830 points and conceded 39; overall they scored 976 points and conceded only 59. On their arrival back in New Zealand on 6March 1906, the All Blacks were welcomed by a crowd of 10,000 before being hosted at a civic reception in Auckland. Invited {{to speak at the}} reception, Gallaher said: [...] "We did not go behind our back to talk about the Welshman, but candidly said that on that day the better team had won.

500|$|Other {{characters}} commonly express {{lessons learned}} from the antagonistic actions Cartman commonly provokes; this has resulted in these characters giving their opinions on issues such as hate crime legislation, civil liberties, excessive religious devotion, the stem cell controversy, anabolic steroid use, the [...] "right to die" [...] debate, and prejudice. In the season 10 (2006) episode [...] "Cartoon Wars Part II", Cartman, planning to exploit the public's fear of terrorism, seeks to get the Fox television series Family Guy, a program he despises, permanently removed from the airwaves when Fox plans to air an episode despite its inclusion of a cartoon likeness of Muhammad. This leads Kyle to give a short speech about the ethics of censorship, which reiterates Parker and Stone's sentiments of [...] "Either it's all okay, or none of it is" [...] in regards to whether or not any subject should remain off-limits to satire. Both Cartman's commentary and the commentary resulting in response to his actions have been interpreted as statements Parker and Stone are attempting to <b>make</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> viewing public, and these opinions have been subject to much critical analysis in the media and literary world.|$|E
