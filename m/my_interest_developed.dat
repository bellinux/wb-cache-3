Being part of a community is so important and having high, but reachable expectations and achieving them is so empowering. ” [...] collaborative teacher planner. I have been interested in the concept of collaboration for many years. First, as a teacher, I quickly learned the value of collaboration with colleagues and worked hard to create my own networks and/or spaces for collaboration. I constantly sought opportunities to take advantage of working with other teachers around specific student issues or on school teams about school-wide problems. As <b>my</b> <b>interest</b> <b>developed,</b> I found myself wanting to work in collaboration with school staffs for program improvement. Ultimately, I sought a principalship in large part because I felt that leadership should be focused on empowering adults to work collaboratively for the benefit of all students, and I wanted to try and provide that kind of leadership. I truly believe that learning to work together toward “shared goals ” is more critical for our children and adults now than it has ever been. There is a special sense of “belongingness ” that comes when a group of people collectively accomplish a goal or task. It may be defined as “belonging for a purpose. ” Children and adults experience a growth in self worth as they work with others to make something positive happen in their world. I have learned that working together toward shared goals involves pain and struggle. Peopl...|$|E

40|$|<b>My</b> <b>interest</b> in {{photography}} began when I {{was twelve years}} old. This fascination developed because I was able to 'keep' things that I saw. It {{was a way of}} holding onto an experience that I liked. The first photographs were mainly of objects and animals [not people] and an occasional picture of a friend or familymember As <b>my</b> <b>interest</b> changed and <b>developed</b> photography became a way of not only holding onto an experience but the camera helped to create a new one. I can remember thinking to myself after photographing some people on a dock that I didn't care how the photographs came out but the fact that I enjoyed taking them was enough. I held onto this idea for a long time. Looking at photographs that I've taken has always served as an open door to relive the experience before, during and after the picture was taken. Many years later I realized that the experience of taking the picture was not fulfilling enough. I was beginning to see photography as a craft. At this point in time my photography is used as a way of preserving my experiences, creating new ones and as a craft. I am interested in the print as a separat...|$|R

What three years at UCSD have taught me however is that the solution [...] or rather remedy [...] to both of these truths is work: hard, uncompromising, rigorous work. Don’t know your lines, uncertain about your character arc, not sure if you’re good enough? Put in work. The result is unequivocally in tall or short order, greater confidence. The same applies to inspiration. Have I developed a greater number of avenues to pursue inspiration than I had never dreamed? Certainly. Does inspiration continue to elude me at times? Of course.

40|$|This {{study is}} based on my work as a teacher of Swedish {{language}} and literature to upper secondary school students, and <b>my</b> <b>interest</b> in <b>developing</b> the teaching of literature by using both new criticism theories and theories of literary perception focusing on reader response. The {{purpose of the study}} is to examine the learning process in trying to develop literary competence and {{to find out how to}} describe the competence shown by the students. My starting-point is a discussion about literary competence and the theory and model of literary competence by Örjan Torell. In examining literary competence, by how students use their constitutional competence as well as performance and literary transfer competences, Torell´s model shows the possibility and the need for both knowledge of literature and personal reception by focusing on the dialogue between author and reader. The method is qualitative and the empirics are material collected in one senior high school class in the Social Science programme during their second and third year. The material contains written reading logs, written answers to tasks and transcribed recordings of discussions of literature. The analysis shows a variety among the literary competence shown and developed by the students and points to the complexity of understanding the concept of literary competence. The model proves to be useful in focusing the teaching and learning of literature and the results indicate that teaching of literature by combining learning of epochs, genres, ideas and conceptions with personal reading is a valuable approach.

40|$|<b>My</b> {{research}} <b>interests</b> involve <b>developing</b> new theoretically sound frameworks {{to tackle}} important systems problems, {{with a particular}} emphasis on parallel processing and sophisticated code analysis. This work allows me to combine <b>my</b> wide-ranging <b>interests</b> in algorithms, theoretical computer science, parallel computer architecture, compiler analysis, and an experimental approach to computer systems research. In my thesis research, I have focused specifically {{on the problem of}} how to create a powerful yet efficient dynamic code analysis framework that can find software bugs in parallel programs as they execute. My main research contribution is dataflow analysis-based parallel monitoring, an entirely new approach to dynamic application monitoring with advantages similar to dataflow analysis, but in the entirely different context of online parallel monitoring. Using insights from dataflow analysis, my frameworks enable parallel application monitoring without capturing a total order of application instructions across parallel threads. I provably guarantee zero false negatives for any particular analysis developed in my framework. In fact, my frameworks are general enough to support execution on arbitrary relaxed memory consistency models, where such a total order may not even exist. More broadly, I plan to explore other opportunities for creating provably sound platforms for making parallel systems more robust and efficient. 1 Thesis Overview: Dynamic Parallel Program Monitoring Monitoring parallel programs is much more difficult than monitoring sequential programs. In sequential programs, it is sufficient to analyze an execution trace of the instructions in commit order: any reordering by the processor is guaranteed to preserv...|$|R

40|$|<b>My</b> <b>interest</b> in the <b>developing</b> countries, {{and some}} {{consequences}} of their catching up with the advanced ones, has several origins. One is experiences in government, at the RAND Corpo-ration and at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business, experiences that brought me into con-tact with people from many developing countries—or at least data and analyses about them. One of these was the Soviet Union, {{although it was not}} then widely regarded as underdevel-oped. In the mid- 1980 s, Charles Wolf and I edited two books on the economy of the Soviet Union whose principal thesis was the advanced state of decay of that system. It was, to be sure, a pathological case but pathologies can be instructive. The immediate cause of my work on the developing countries was Professor Samuel Huntington’s book The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order. My imme-diate reaction was that most people in the future would be too rich to be engaged in “clash-ing. ” That was not an especially well informed opinion but it led to my investigating the current state of development economics and some of the known consequences of develop-ment. A profoundly important one of these is the connection, evidently a causal one, between economic and political development. If one accepts, as this monograph argues, that much o...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This {{study is}} based on my work as a {{secondary}} school teacher of literature and the Swedish language and rooted in <b>my</b> <b>interest</b> in <b>developing</b> knowledge {{about the importance of}} teaching literature in order to both cultivate young people’s reading habits and their view of themselves as readers. The more concrete {{purpose of this study is}} to examine a reading project that focuses on theories of literary perception and teaching literature. I examine four pupils who, in 2003, participated in the reading project as readers and compare this description with their view of themselves as readers seven years later. I complete the study by examining how they discuss reading and the teaching of literature. The method is qualitative and the empirics include materiel collected in two different time periods: first in 2003, in a class I taught in a secondary school; and second in 2010, when I examined four of the former pupils who participated in the project from 2003. The material contains documentation of the reading project, teacher’s notes and observations during the reading project, transcribed recordings of interviews, the pupils’ written reading logs and written inquiries about reading habits. The study shows a variety in literary perception among the pupils and attitudes towards reading. The study also shows that enlightened teaching can contribute to pupils’ motivation to read literature. One of the didactic challenges concerning these findings is that the teacher — before planning and executing the lesson — should be aware of the pupils’ reading habits and attitudes towards reading in order to be able to adjust the teaching process to the pupils’ conditions. The teacher should also be aware of the societal context of which pupils are a part and try to integrate the use of media other than literature. Finally, the teacher should be both skillful at utilizing different literature teaching methods and at choosing literature...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{decisions}} a man named David Kaso made during the time I lived {{with him and his}} family. It describes how David tried {{to make sense of what}} he should do in different situations, and the doubts and uncertainties that he experienced as he did so. Through looking at David’s life in detail the thesis suggests some of the limits of ethnographic methodologies to explain people’s actions. <b>My</b> <b>interest</b> in uncertainty <b>developed</b> during the course of a fifteenmonth stay with David’s family in Chimtengo village, in the rural Central Region of Malawi. There was an overarching imperative on people in Chimtengo to give each other help, yet how exactly he should mediate this support was not something that always appeared easy for David to work out. There were structures that gave some order to his relationships and to what he did. Through getting to know David over a long period I became aware of the significance to him of being a ‘strong’ Christian, a good husband, and a big man. Following the course of his life in detail though, the limits of these different ideas as heuristic devices, or social rules of thumb, became apparent. These limits left David doubtful of his decisions, and me to live with uncertainties about my analysis of his actions. Focusing on David’s life suggested the heuristic nature of ethnographic knowledge, some of the ways that it is constrained by the time and the relationships out of which it is produced...|$|R
