40|$|Lubricated “soft” contacts, {{where one}} or both {{contacting}} solids have a low elastic modulus, are present in many practical engineering and biological applications including windscreen wipers, wet tyres, elastomeric seals, contact lenses and the tongue/palate system. In such contacts, the prevailing lubrication mode is “isoviscous EHL” (elastohydrodynamic lubrication). Unlike in steel–steel contacts, rolling friction can be considerable and this originates {{in part from the}} viscoelastic properties of the compliant surfaces. In this paper the influence on friction of both applied load and the elastic properties of the solids is studied using a mini traction machine. In this machine, the rolling and sliding friction can be separately determined. The viscoelastic properties of the polymers employed are measured using a dynamic mechanical <b>analysis</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The measured friction is compared to theoretical models for soft EHL and the viscoelastic energy losses arising from the contact deformation.
