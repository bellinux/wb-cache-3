50|$|There are {{two basic}} types of transponders. The first are the {{electric}} coupled transponder systems. Electric coupled transponder systems {{are not limited to}} small areas for transmission but can transmit messages or signals for different ranges of distance including several inches to miles, as used in satellites and airplanes. These systems require large amounts of constant electricity to operate. The second type, used by automobile manufacturers, are called <b>magnetic</b> <b>coupled</b> transponder systems. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>coupled</b> transponder systems are passive in nature. This means they do not require constant electricity and thus do not need a power source of their own. They operate in the frequency range area of 125 kHz. Since <b>magnetic</b> <b>coupled</b> transponders do not have their own power source, they are very limited in range of communication and generally operate in the range of 1 cm to 15 cm. Since this is a radio frequency, it can penetrate materials that would make the transponder not directly visible, such as the plastic or rubber in the bow of a key.|$|R

They conclude that the best models are Hoyle's <b>magnetic</b> <b>coupling</b> and McCrea's floccules.|$|E
25|$|The new {{generation}} Zero-Hum P-90 Hx by Kinman has an authentic P-90 sound and appearance but {{is far more}} complex with some 202 individual parts. Sonically destructive <b>magnetic</b> <b>coupling</b> between the coils is negated by highly efficient magnetic shields around the upper coil. The lower coil is wound with much thicker wire and far fewer turns onto a unique laminated steel bobbin which imparts ultra high efficiency; thus, the hum voltage {{is the same as}} the upper coil and cancels hum perfectly. Kinman advertise their P-90 Hx as having a sonically transparent 600-Ohm hum sensor which is remarkable considering the large amount of hum that P-90s put out.|$|E
25|$|When {{the spark}} gap fires, the charged {{capacitor}} discharges into the primary winding, causing the primary circuit to oscillate. The oscillating primary current creates an oscillating magnetic field that couples to the secondary winding, transferring {{energy into the}} secondary side of the transformer and causing it to oscillate with the toroid capacitance to ground. Energy transfer occurs {{over a number of}} cycles, until most of the energy that was originally in the primary side is transferred to the secondary side. The greater the <b>magnetic</b> <b>coupling</b> between windings, the shorter the time required to complete the energy transfer. As energy builds within the oscillating secondary circuit, the amplitude of the toroid's RF voltage rapidly increases, and the air surrounding the toroid begins to undergo dielectric breakdown, forming a corona discharge.|$|E

25|$|A {{piezoelectric}} transformer {{is a type}} of AC voltage multiplier. Unlike {{a conventional}} transformer, which uses <b>magnetic</b> <b>coupling</b> between input and output, the piezoelectric transformer uses acoustic coupling. An input voltage is applied across a short length of a bar of piezoceramic material such as PZT, creating an alternating stress in the bar by the inverse piezoelectric effect and causing the whole bar to vibrate. The vibration frequency is chosen to be the resonant frequency of the block, typically in the 100kilohertz to 1megahertz range. A higher output voltage is then generated across another section of the bar by the piezoelectric effect. Step-up ratios of more than 1,000:1 have been demonstrated. An extra feature of this transformer is that, by operating it above its resonant frequency, it can be made to appear as an inductive load, which is useful in circuits that require a controlled soft start. These devices can be used in DC–AC inverters to drive cold cathode fluorescent lamps. Piezo transformers {{are some of the most}} compact high voltage sources.|$|E

2500|$|First {{generation}} Stacks have {{a second}} identical coil placed below the main one. [...] Hum is effectively cancelled by connecting both coils out of phase; however, as with all common stacks {{there is a large}} degree of <b>magnetic</b> <b>coupling</b> between the coils and string signal is cancelled along with the hum. [...] Manufacturers over-wind the coils to recover the loss of output but this introduces a second problem of excessive coil capacitance which robs the sound of dynamics, presence and touch sensitivity. [...] These two design flaws led to these types of pickups acquiring a bad reputation among musicians.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{interaction}} {{mechanism of the}} plasma and the magnetic field, this paper has proposed the deposition process of <b>coupled</b> <b>magnetic</b> field to enhance the arc ion plating. Meanwhile, it has also analyzed the distribution, the polarity and the configuration of <b>coupled</b> <b>magnetic</b> field combining with the finite element simulation. The influence of <b>coupled</b> <b>magnetic</b> field on the distribution, the ionization rate, the surface quality of film and the deposition rate of arc ion plating has been also systematically discussed in this paper. What’s more, the reduction mechanism of <b>coupled</b> <b>magnetic</b> field for the marco-particles on film surface has been also proposed.

With the increase of the strength of DC <b>coupled</b> <b>magnetic</b> field, the number and the size of marco-particles on film surface have been greatly reduced and the deposition rate of film has been exponentially increased.

2500|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>coupling</b> devices {{transmit}} torque through magnetically transparent barriers (that is, {{the barrier}} is non-magnetic or is magnetic {{but is not}} affected by an applied magnetic field), for instance between sealed containers or pressurised vessels. The optimal torque couplings consists {{of a pair of}} coaxially nested cylinders with opposite +k and [...] -k flux magnetization patterns, as this configuration is the only system for infinitely long cylinders that produce a torque. In the lowest energy state, the outer flux of the inner cylinder exactly matches the internal flux of the outer cylinder.

2500|$|In {{this model}} (from 1944) the {{companion}} went nova with ejected material {{captured by the}} Sun and planets forming from this material. In a version a year later it was a supernova. [...] In 1955 he proposed a similar system to Laplace, and with more mathematical detail in 1960. It differs from Laplace in that a magnetic torque occurs between the disk and the Sun, which comes into effect immediately or else more and more matter would be ejected resulting in a much too massive planetary system, one comparable to the Sun. The torque causes a <b>magnetic</b> <b>coupling</b> and acts to transfer angular momentum from the Sun to the disk. The magnetic field strength {{would have to be}} 1 gauss. The existence of torque depends on magnetic lines of force being frozen into the disk (a consequence of a well-known MHD (magnetohydrodynamic) theorem on frozen-in lines of force). As the solar condensation temperature when the disk was ejected could not be much more than 1000 degrees K., a number of refractories must be solid, probably as fine smoke particles, which would grow with condensation and accretion. These particles would be swept out with the disk only if their diameter at the Earth's orbit was less than 1 meter so as the disk moved outward a subsidiary disk consisting of only refractories remains behind where the terrestrial planets would form. The model is in good agreement with the mass and composition of the planets and angular momentum distribution provided the <b>magnetic</b> <b>coupling</b> is an acceptable idea, but not explained are twinning, the low mass of Mars and Mercury, and the planetoid belts. It was Alfvén who formulated the concept of frozen-in magnetic field lines.|$|E

40|$|The {{interplay between}} {{magnetism}} and structure {{has been studied}} in magnetic multilayers by electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory and analyzed in terms of models. The main ideas behind the Korringa-Kohn-Rostocker Green’s function method are described and {{the implementation of the}} coherent potential approximation is outlined. A simple model for the bilinear <b>magnetic</b> interlayer <b>coupling</b> in metallic multilayers is derived that elucidates the main characteristics of the effect such as coupling period and origin of damping. An analysis of two exotic effects on the <b>magnetic</b> interlayer <b>coupling,</b> Fermi surface nesting and magnetic enhancement is also performed. The Fermi surface nesting in CuPd for the (110) direction is shown to induce a sharp peak in the <b>magnetic</b> interlayer <b>coupling</b> amplitude for a Fe/CuPd/Fe system when the Cu concentration is 60 % in the CuPd alloy. The high magnetic susceptibility in Pd is shown to have strong influence on the <b>magnetic</b> interlayer <b>coupling</b> in a Fe/Pd/Fe (100) system where it changes the amplitude, phase and induces an offset. The relation between surface structure and magnetic properties in metallic multilayers is investigated in terms of a theory that is based on a symbiosis between experiment and theory. By calculating the total magnetic moment of a sample for a large range of possible interface structures and comparing to experimental results for equivalent samples a parameter that describes the interface structure is determined. This parameter is then shown to be universal for the particular combination of elements in the structure both as regards the calculated total magnetic moment as well as the <b>magnetic</b> interlayer <b>coupling</b> and the critical temperatures...|$|R
