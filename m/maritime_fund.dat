40|$|This {{short report}} forms {{part of the}} ambitious CBS Maritime {{research}} initiative entitled “Competitive Challenges and Strategic Development Potential in Global Maritime Industries”, which was launched in 2014 with the generous support of the Danish <b>Maritime</b> <b>Fund.</b> The competitiveness initiative targets specific maritime industries (including shipping, offshore energy, ports, and maritime service and equipment suppliers) as well as addresses topics that cut across maritime industries (regulation and competitiveness). The topics and narrower research questions addressed in the initiative were developed in close dialogue between CBS Maritime and the maritime industries in Denmark. CBS Maritime is a Business in Society (BiS) Platform at Copenhagen Business School committed to the big {{question of how to}} achieve economic and social progress in the maritime industries. CBS Maritime aims to strengthen a maritime focus at CBS and create the foundation for CBS as a stronger partner for the maritime industries, as well as for other universities and business school with a devotion to maritime economics research. The competitiveness initiative comprises a number of PhD projects and five short-term mapping projects, the latter aiming at developing key concepts and building up a basic industry knowledge-base for further development of CBS Maritime research and teaching. This report attempts to map the fundamental changes in financing methods, ownership structures and strategies within the Danish product tanker segment...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} part of the {{research}} project “The competitive challenges and strategic development possibilities for The Blue Denmark”, which was launched in 2014. The project is funded by the Danish <b>Maritime</b> <b>Fund</b> and carried out by researchers at CBS Maritime which is a Business in Society Platform at Copenhagen Business School with a focus on value creation in the maritime industries. The project embraces various maritime segments from shipping and offshore to ports and suppliers. The research questions for the individual projects have been formulated by researchers at CBS Maritime in cooperation with companies in the maritime sector. This report “Offshore Supply Industry Dynamics – Business strategies in the offshore supply industry” is the second report in mapping project D. It examines the markets and business strategies of various suppliers and furthermore presents an analysis of the challenges and opportunities for the companies engaged in the different parts of the sector. The report is developed from interviews with top management of key players in the Danish supply industry combined with studies on management literature. The macro- and meso levels of the offshore sector are examined in the CBS Maritime report “Offshore Supply Chain Dynamics – The main drivers in the energy sector and the value chain characteristics for offshore oil and gas and offshore wind”, which constitutes the first part of mapping project D. It offers insights into the main drivers in the energy sector (macro level) and the value chain characteristics for offshore oil and gas and offshore wind (meso level) ...|$|E

Mathematics, practical and technical subjects, sciences, foreign languages, Chinese classics and history were taught at the school. Students also took exams.

Then around 1885 demand slackened off and with falling prices, the employers felt the need to reduce their labour force, and cut the wages of those who remained. The Maritime Labour Council (MLC) was formed in Adelaide in 1886 and the following year raised a <b>Maritime</b> Strike <b>Fund</b> of ₤9,600, of which various workers' unions subscribed around half.

While all the yards were to be built by private contractors and operated by commercial shipbuilding companies, the new yards were financed by the <b>Maritime</b> Commission with <b>funds</b> authorized by Congress and thus owned by Federal Government. One of the new yards planned for construction was to be in Baltimore, Maryland and would be run by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation. That facility became known as the Bethlehem-Fairfield shipyard for the Fairfield section of Baltimore, where it was located. Bethlehem Shipbuilding was one of the nation's largest shipbuilding companies having construction yards on the East Coast in Quincy, Massachusetts, on Staten Island, New York and at Sparrows Point, also in Baltimore.|$|R

He needed and prized loyal local lords for governing since {{he spent much of}} his reign (1534–1549) on military campaigns. Local lords in turn were loyal to him, not to the highly devolved central administration. Not surprisingly, the kingdom he had built up purely through military conquests fell apart right after his death. Indeed, the much greater empire of Bayinnaung, which too was built on sheer military conquests, would see the same fate within the decade following the conqueror's death in 1581. The weak decentralized administration era would continue until the early 17th century when Restored Toungoo kings first introduced administrative reforms to centralize power.|$|R
