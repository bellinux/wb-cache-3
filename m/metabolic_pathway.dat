40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new graph-based algorithm for identifying branched <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> in multi-genome scale metabolic data. The term branched {{is used to}} refer to <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> between compounds that consist of multiple pathways that interact biochemically. A branched pathway may produce a target compound through a combination of linear pathways that split compounds into smaller ones, work in parallel with many compounds, and join compounds into larger ones. While branched <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> predominate in <b>metabolic</b> networks, most previous work has focused on identifying linear <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathways.</b> The ability to automatically identify branched pathways is important in applications that require a deeper understanding of metabolism, such as metabolic engineering and drug target identification. The algorithm presented in this paper utilizes explicit atom track-ing to identify linear <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> and then merges them together into branched <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathways.</b> We provide results on several well characterized <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> that demonstrate that the new merging approach can efficiently find biologically relevant branched <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathways.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a graph-based algorithm for identifying complex <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> in multi-genome scale metabolic data. These complex pathways are called branched pathways {{because they can}} arrive at a target compound through combinations of pathways that split compounds into smaller ones, work in parallel with many compounds, and join compounds into larger ones. While most previous work has focused on identifying linear <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathways,</b> branched <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> predominate in <b>metabolic</b> networks.

5|$|Oxidative {{phosphorylation}} (or OXPHOS in short) is the <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathway</b> {{in which}} cells use enzymes to oxidize nutrients, thereby releasing energy {{which is used}} to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In most eukaryotes, this takes place inside mitochondria. Almost all aerobic organisms carry out oxidative phosphorylation. This pathway is probably so pervasive because it is a highly efficient way of releasing energy, compared to alternative fermentation processes such as anaerobic glycolysis.|$|E
5|$|Several enzymes {{can work}} {{together}} in a specific order, creating metabolic pathways. In a <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathway,</b> one enzyme takes the product of another enzyme as a substrate. After the catalytic reaction, the product is then passed on to another enzyme. Sometimes more than one enzyme can catalyze the same reaction in parallel; this can allow more complex regulation: with, for example, a low constant activity provided by one enzyme but an inducible high activity from a second enzyme.|$|E
5|$|Allosteric {{sites are}} pockets on the enzyme, {{distinct}} from the active site, that bind to molecules in the cellular environment. These molecules then cause {{a change in the}} conformation or dynamics of the enzyme that is transduced to the active site and thus affects the reaction rate of the enzyme. In this way, allosteric interactions can either inhibit or activate enzymes. Allosteric interactions with metabolites upstream or downstream in an enzyme's <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathway</b> cause feedback regulation, altering the activity of the enzyme according to the flux {{through the rest of the}} pathway.|$|E
40|$|Understanding <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} fields in bioscience in the post-genomic era, but curating <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> requires considerable man-power. As such there is a lack of reliable, experimentally verified <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> in databases and databases are forced to predict all but the most immediately useful pathways. Text-mining has the potential to solve this problem, but while sophisticated text-mining methods have been developed to assist the curation of many types of biomedical networks, such as proteinâ€“protein interaction networks, the mining of <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> from the literature has been largely neglected by the text-mining community.

40|$|Motivation: Construction of {{synthetic}} <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> promises sustainable production of diverse chemicals and materials. In order to design synthetic <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> of high value, computational methods {{are needed to}} expand present knowledge by mining com-prehensive chemical and enzymatic information databases. Several computational methods have been already reported for the metabol-ic pathway design, but until now computation complexity has limited the diversity of chemical and enzymatic data used. Results: We introduce a computational platform, M-path, to explore synthetic <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> including putative enzymatic reactions and compounds. M-path is an iterative random algorithm which makes efficient use of chemical and enzymatic databases to find potential synthetic <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathways.</b> M-path can readily control the search space, and perform well compared to exhaustively enu-merating possible pathways. A web-based pathway viewer is also developed to check extensive <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> with evaluation scores {{on the basis of}} chemical similarities. We further produce extensive synthetic <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> for a comprehensive set of alpha amino acids. The scalable nature of M-path enables us to calculate potential <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> for any given chemicals.

The nearest neighbor algorithm was used to perform the prediction of the networking relationship occurring in the <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathways.</b> The average overall success rate by jackknife cross-validation tests for the 79 <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> in the budding yeast system was over 94 %, suggesting that the current approach might become {{a useful tool for}} studying <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> and many other networking-related areas...|$|R
5|$|Linezolid is metabolized in the liver, by {{oxidation}} of the morpholine ring, without {{involvement of}} the cytochrome P450 system. This <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathway</b> leads to two major inactive metabolites (which each account for around 45% and 10% of an excreted dose at steady state), one minor metabolite, and several trace metabolites, none of which {{accounts for more than}} 1% of an excreted dose. Clearance of linezolid varies with age and gender; it is fastest in children (which accounts for the shorter half-life), and appears to be 20% lower in women than in men. There is a strong correlation between linezolid clearance and creatinine clearance (CLCR).|$|E
5|$|Adaptation {{may cause}} either the gain {{of a new}} feature, or the loss of an ancestral feature. An example that shows both types of change is {{bacterial}} adaptation to antibiotic selection, with genetic changes causing antibiotic resistance by both modifying {{the target of the}} drug, or increasing the activity of transporters that pump the drug out of the cell. Other striking examples are the bacteria Escherichia coli evolving the ability to use citric acid as a nutrient in a long-term laboratory experiment, Flavobacterium evolving a novel enzyme that allows these bacteria to grow on the by-products of nylon manufacturing, and the soil bacterium Sphingobium evolving an entirely new <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathway</b> that degrades the synthetic pesticide pentachlorophenol. An interesting but still controversial idea is that some adaptations might increase the ability of organisms to generate genetic diversity and adapt by natural selection (increasing organisms' evolvability).|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{are genetically}} {{distinct}} from bacteria and eukaryotes, {{with up to}} 15% of the proteins encoded by any one archaeal genome being unique to the domain, although most of these unique genes have no known function. Of {{the remainder of the}} unique proteins that have an identified function, most belong to the Euryarchaea and are involved in methanogenesis. The proteins that archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes share form a common core of cell function, relating mostly to transcription, translation, and nucleotide metabolism. Other characteristic archaeal features are the organization of genes of related functionâ€”such as enzymes that catalyze steps in the same <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathway</b> into novel operons, and large differences in tRNA genes and their aminoacyl tRNA synthetases.|$|E

5|$|As the environments of most {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} changing, {{the reactions of}} metabolism must be finely regulated to maintain a constant set of conditions within cells, a condition called homeostasis. Metabolic regulation also allows organisms to respond to signals and interact actively with their environments. Two closely linked concepts are important for understanding how metabolic pathways are controlled. Firstly, the regulation of an enzyme in a pathway is how its activity is increased and decreased in response to signals. Secondly, the control exerted by this enzyme is the effect that these changes in its activity have on the overall rate of the pathway (the flux through the pathway). For example, an enzyme may show large changes in activity (i.e. it is highly regulated) but if these changes have {{little effect on the}} flux of a <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathway,</b> then this enzyme is not involved in the control of the pathway.|$|E
5|$|Classically, {{metabolism}} is {{studied by}} a reductionist approach {{that focuses on}} a single <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathway.</b> Particularly valuable {{is the use of}} radioactive tracers at the whole-organism, tissue and cellular levels, which define the paths from precursors to final products by identifying radioactively labelled intermediates and products. The enzymes that catalyze these chemical reactions can then be purified and their kinetics and responses to inhibitors investigated. A parallel approach is to identify the small molecules in a cell or tissue; the complete set of these molecules is called the metabolome. Overall, these studies give {{a good view of the}} structure and function of simple metabolic pathways, but are inadequate when applied to more complex systems such as the metabolism of a complete cell.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{also occur}} {{naturally}} and {{are involved in}} the regulation of metabolism. For example, enzymes in a <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathway</b> can be inhibited by downstream products. This type of negative feedback slows the production line when products begin to build up and is an important way to maintain homeostasis in a cell. Other cellular enzyme inhibitors are proteins that specifically bind to and inhibit an enzyme target. This can help control enzymes that may be damaging to a cell, like proteases or nucleases. A well-characterised example of this is the ribonuclease inhibitor, which binds to ribonucleases in one of the tightest known proteinâ€“protein interactions. Natural enzyme inhibitors can also be poisons and are used as defences against predators or as ways of killing prey.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{methodology}} to estimate rates of enzymatic reactions in <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathways.</b> Our methodology is based on applying stochastic logic learning in ensemble learning.

We construct ensembles by manipulating the data and driving randomness into a learning algorithm. We applied failure adjusted maximization as a base learning algorithm. The proposed ensemble methods are applied to estimate the rate of reactions in <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

5|$|Enzymes can {{be either}} {{activated}} or inhibited by other molecules. For example, the end product(s) of a <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathway</b> are often inhibitors {{for one of the}} first enzymes of the pathway (usually the first irreversible step, called committed step), thus regulating the amount of end product made by the pathways. Such a regulatory mechanism is called a negative feedback mechanism, because the amount of the end product produced is regulated by its own concentration. Negative feedback mechanism can effectively adjust the rate of synthesis of intermediate metabolites according {{to the demands of the}} cells. This helps with effective allocations of materials and energy economy, and it prevents the excess manufacture of end products. Like other homeostatic devices, the control of enzymatic action helps to maintain a stable internal environment in living organisms.|$|E
5|$|Proteins can {{associate}} to form protein complexes, these often contain {{a set of}} proteins with similar functions, such as enzymes that carry out several steps in the same <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathway.</b> This organization can allow substrate channeling, which is when the product of one enzyme is passed directly to the next enzyme in a pathway without being released into solution. Channeling can make a pathway more rapid and efficient {{than it would be}} if the enzymes were randomly distributed in the cytosol, and can also prevent the release of unstable reaction intermediates. Although a wide variety of metabolic pathways involve enzymes that are tightly bound to each other, others may involve more loosely associated complexes that are very difficult to study outside the cell. Consequently, the importance of these complexes for metabolism in general remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|The termite gut has {{inspired}} various research efforts aimed at replacing fossil fuels with cleaner, renewable energy sources. Termites are efficient bioreactors, {{capable of producing}} two litres of hydrogen from a single sheet of paper. Approximately 200 species of microbes live inside the termite hindgut, releasing the hydrogen that was trapped inside wood and plants that they digest. Through the action of unidentified enzymes in the termite gut, lignocellulose polymers are broken down into sugars and are transformed into hydrogen. The bacteria within the gut turns the sugar and hydrogen into cellulose acetate, an acetate ester of cellulose on which termites rely for energy. Community DNA sequencing of the microbes in the termite hindgut has been employed to provide {{a better understanding of}} the <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathway.</b> Genetic engineering may enable hydrogen to be generated in bioreactors from woody biomass.|$|E

As a first step, we show also how SMSR {{may be used to}} simulate Stochastic Petri Nets for describing <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathways...</b>|$|R
5|$|There are {{multiple}} levels of metabolic regulation. In intrinsic regulation, the <b>metabolic</b> <b>pathway</b> self-regulates {{to respond to}} changes in the levels of substrates or products; for example, a decrease in the amount of product can increase the flux through the pathway to compensate. This type of regulation often involves allosteric regulation of the activities of multiple enzymes in the pathway. Extrinsic control involves a cell in a multicellular organism changing its metabolism in response to signals from other cells. These signals are usually in the form of soluble messengers such as hormones and growth factors and are detected by specific receptors on the cell surface. These signals are then transmitted inside the cell by second messenger systems that often involved the phosphorylation of proteins.|$|E
