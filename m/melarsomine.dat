40|$|Abstract Background Heartworm {{disease in}} dogs is a {{life-threatening}} parasitic disease. Although adulticide treatment with <b>melarsomine</b> {{has been proven}} {{to be the most}} effective, complications associated with adulticide treatment are major concerns for clinicians. Methods This study evaluated the change in levels of D-dimer, interleukin- 6, C-reactive protein and cardiac troponin I in 12 dogs with different severities of heartworm infection treated by the American Heartworm Society (AHS) recommended protocol during the treatment period. The serum levels of several markers were measured on the day of diagnosis (T- 60), before the initiation of <b>melarsomine</b> therapy (T 0), 1  day after the first injection (T 1), 1  week after the first injection (T 7), 1  month after the first injection (T 30), 1  day after the second injection (T 31), 1  day after the third injection (T 32), 1  week after the third injection (T 39), 1  month after the third injection (T 62), 2  months after the third injection (T 92), 3  months after the third injection (T 122), and 6  months after the third injection (T 182). Results The serum levels of these markers were significantly different at the test time point after <b>melarsomine</b> treatment and also differed significantly according to the stage of heartworm disease in the dogs. Conclusion This study found that monitoring of inflammatory and hemostatic markers in dogs with heartworm disease being treated with <b>melarsomine</b> might be beneficial in predicting the clinical outcomes and complications associated with <b>melarsomine</b> treatment...|$|E
40|$|<b>Melarsomine</b> {{dihydrochloride}} {{is highly}} effective against both sexes of adult and L 5 Dirofilaria immitis. Common adverse reactions include injection site irritation and reluctance to move. Neurologic complications associated with i. m. injection of <b>melarsomine</b> dihydrochloride {{for treatment of}} heartworm disease in 3 dogs are described. Different degrees of neurologic complications have been identified; the pathophysiologic features are unknown. It is speculated that the compound migrates out of the injection site via fascial planes and causes an ascending inflammation along nerve roots. The resulting extradural cord compression secondary to extensive inflammation and necrosis of epidural fat could induce a variety of neurologic deficits. Alternatively, inappropriate injection technique may result in direct contact of <b>melarsomine</b> with neural tissue. A heightened awareness of proper injection technique might prevent the development of most neurologic complications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The “susceptibility gap” in a dog {{diagnosed}} with adult heartworms {{has been defined}} as the period of time in which some Dirofilaria immitis stages are not susceptible to treatment with either macrocyclic lactones or <b>melarsomine</b> dihydrochloride. This was previously defined within the American Heartworm Society guidelines as a period of about 3  months “as per product labels. ” It can be postulated, however, that a susceptibility gap does not exist with the combination of continued macrocyclic lactone therapy coupled with a three-dose <b>melarsomine</b> dihydrochloride protocol where the first intramuscular treatment is near the time of first diagnosis. Discussion <b>Melarsomine</b> dihydrochloride was originally also investigated as a “preventive” as well as a treatment for adult heartworm infection where it would be given to dogs by intramuscular injection every 4  months; therefore, there was early interest in its ability to kill younger worms. A single intramuscular injection of 2. 5  mg <b>melarsomine</b> dihydrochloride/kg has an efficacy of 82. 1 % against 4 -month-old worms. When it was given to dogs with older heartworms, 7 and 12  months of age, a single injection was only 55. 6 % and 51. 7 % effective, respectively. Thiacetarsamide {{has been shown to be}} 99. 7 % effective against 2 -month-old heartworms and other work has shown that <b>melarsomine</b> dihydrochloride is 100 % efficacious against these younger forms. With the development and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of spinosad + milbemycin oxime (Trifexis®, Elanco), milbemycin oxime + praziquantel (Interceptor® Plus, Novartis, now Elanco), and milbemycin oxime + lufenuron + praziquantel (Sentinel® Spectrum®, Novartis, now Virbac), it was shown that repeated treatments of dogs with milbemycin oxime also has efficacy against 3 -month-old heartworms. Thus, no improvement in efficacy is expected with a delay in initiating therapy with both <b>melarsomine</b> dihydrochloride and macrocyclic lactones, even with the presence of younger heartworms. Starting treatment at diagnosis appears to be acceptable for maximal heartworm clearance based on published data. Delaying treatment has the disadvantage of allowing disease progression and continued heartworm growth. Conclusions The collective data that has been reviewed indicates that continued macrocyclic lactone administration with two additional injections of <b>melarsomine</b> dihydrochloride a month later will protect dogs against all heartworm stages, including those heartworms 2  months of age or younger at diagnosis, when both treatments are started upon diagnosis...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} of heartworm treatment {{is to improve}} the clinical condition of the patient and to eliminate pre-cardiac, juvenile, and adult worm stages with minimal complications. Pulmonary thromboembolisms are an inevitable consequence of worm death and can result in severe pulmonary reactions and even death of the patient. To minimize these reactions, various treatment protocols involving <b>melarsomine,</b> the only adulticidal drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administrations (FDA), in conjunction with macrocyclic lactone heartworm preventives and glucocorticosteroids have been advocated. The discovery of the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia in Dirofilaria immitis has led to several experimental studies examining the effects of administering doxycycline to reduce or eliminate Wolbachia organism. These studies have shown a decrease in gross and microscopic pathology of pulmonary parenchyma in experimental heartworm infections pretreated with doxycycline before <b>melarsomine</b> administration. Methods Electronic medical records from a large veterinary practice in northeast Alabama were searched to identify dogs treated for heartworms with <b>melarsomine</b> from January 2005 through December 2012. The search was refined further to select for dogs that met the following criteria: 1) received two or three doses of ivermectin heartworm preventive prior to <b>melarsomine</b> injections, 2) received one injection of <b>melarsomine</b> followed by two injections 4 to 8  weeks later, and 3) were treated with prednisone following <b>melarsomine</b> injections. The dogs were then divided into those that also were treated with doxycycline 10  mg/kg BID for 4  weeks (Group A, n =  47) and those that did not receive doxycycline (Group B, n =  47). The medical notes of all 94 cases were then reviewed for comments concerning coughing, dyspnea, or hemoptysis in the history, physical exam template, or from telephone conversations with clients the week following each visit. Any dog that died within one year of treatment from either cardiovascular or pulmonary problems was noted. Results Dogs from Group A receiving doxycycline had fewer respiratory complications (6. 52 %) and heartworm disease-related deaths (0 %) than Group B (19. 14 % and 4. 25 %, respectively). Conclusions Although there are not enough cases to indicate statistical significance, the results strongly suggest that including doxycycline into canine heartworm treatment protocols decreases post-treatment complications and mortality in naturally infected clinical cases...|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{determine}} the incidence of the filarial avian nematode Serratospiculum seurati in falcons from Kuwait, report clinical signs and find an effective therapy. Naturally occurring S. seurati infestation was diagnosed in 149 (8. 7  %) out of 1, 706 captive falcons examined between May 2003 and April 2005, and 140 of these were treated with <b>melarsomine</b> at dosage of 0. 25 mg/kg injected intramuscularly for two days, and ivermectin, injected once at the dose of 1 mg/kg, 10 days later. Infestation was reportedly symptomatic in 107 (71. 8  %) and non-symptomatic in 42 (28. 2  %) falcons. Signs reported more often were dyspnoea (58. 8  %), reduced speed and strength in flight (56  %), weight loss (38. 3  %), anorexia/poor appetite (22. 4  %) and lethargy (16. 8  %). After administration of <b>melarsomine,</b> signs disappeared within 1 - 10 days in symptomatic birds and improvement of flight performances was noted in non-symptomatic birds. Dead adult parasites were ejected in 22 cases. Embryonated eggs were not detected in coproscopic checks made 10 and 40 days after the end of therapy, in association with lasting clinical remission.

40|$|Surra is a {{contagious}} disease due to Trypanosoma evansi infection and causes economic loss in animal husbandry, especially in African countries, South America, the Middle East and Asia. In Indonesia, in 2010 to 2011 Trypanosoma outbreak resulted in death of 1159 horses, 600 buffaloes and a cattle.

40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{atypical}} human infections due to the livestock parasite Trypanosoma evansi, or to the rat parasite Trypanosoma lewisi, are reported in humans in Asia. In some cases, clinical evolutions request treatments, however, so far, {{there were very few}} attempts to control T. lewisi using trypanocidal drugs. In a study published elsewhere, the efficacy of human trypanocides is evaluated in laboratory rats, and it concludes that none of them is able to cure rats experimentally infected with T. lewisi. Control of T. lewisi in rat would be a step for identification of drugs against this parasite. In the present study, 4 veterinary drugs: diminazene aceturate, isometamidium chloride, <b>melarsomine</b> hydrochloride and quinapyramine sulfate and chloride, were evaluated at low and high doses, in intra-muscular injections to normal rats experimentally infected with a stock of T. lewisi from Thailand. None of these treatments being efficient, a trial was also made using <b>melarsomine</b> hydrochloride in T. evansi infected rats and in mixed T lewisi and T. evansi infected rats, in order to demonstrate the efficacy of the drugs under the present protocol. T. evansi was cleared from the rat's blood the day after the treatment, while, T lewisi remained unaffected {{until the end of the}} experiment.

40|$|Onchocerca ochengi, a filarial {{parasite}} of cattle, {{represents the}} closest {{relative of the}} human pathogen, Onchocerca volvulus. Both species harbour Wolbachia endosymbionts and are remarkable in that adult female worms remain viable but sessile for many years while surrounded by host cells and antibodies. The basis of the symbiosis between filariae and Wolbachia {{is thought to be}} metabolic, although a role for Wolbachia in immune evasion has received little attention. Neutrophils are attracted to Wolbachia, but following antibiotic chemotherapy they are replaced by eosinophils that degranulate on the worm cuticle. However, it is unclear whether the eosinophils are involved in parasite killing or if they are attracted secondarily to dying worms. In this study, cattle infected with Onchocerca ochengi received adulticidal regimens of oxytetracycline or <b>melarsomine.</b> In contrast to oxytetracycline, <b>melarsomine</b> did not directly affect Wolbachia viability. Eosinophil degranulation increased significantly only in the oxytetracycline group; whereas nodular gene expression of bovine neutrophilic chemokines was lowest in this group.

40|$|Onchocerciasis (River Blindness) is a {{continuing}} major cause of human blindness, skin disease and socioeconomic impediment in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. An estimated 37 million people are infected and a further 89 million are at risk. Human onchocerciasis {{is caused by the}} filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus, and is spread by the blackfly vector Simulium spp, found in riverine areas, encompassing land which is agriculturally valuable. Ivermectin is currently distributed in these areas to control the microfilarial stage of the parasite, but adult worm viability is unaffected. Thus, due to the long lifespan of the worms (> 10 years), treatment regimens must be continued for many years. Furthermore, there are signs that ivermectin resistance is emerging. The bovine filarial parasite Onchocerca ochengi represents the closest phylogenetic relative of 0. volvulus. In both species, female worms reside in nodules, and continue to reproduce for many years whilst surrounded by a milieu of host inflammatory cells and antibodies. In addition, both species harbour endosymbiotic bacteria (Wolbachia) which are essential for worm survival. Although a metabolic role for these bacteria has been hypothesised, the symbiotic mechanisms between filariae and Wolbachia are not fully understood. In the filarial nodule, neutrophils are attracted to Wolbachia-rich worms, but if the bacteria are depleted via antibiotic chemotherapy, the neutrophils are replaced by eosinophils that degranulate on the worm cuticle. However, the specific contribution of eosinophils towards filarial death is unresolved. This study sought to define the role of eosinophils in either the active killing or post-killing clearance of Wolbachia-depleted filariae. In an in-vivo longitudinal study of 0. ochengi- infected cattle receiving adulticidal regimens of oxytetracycline or <b>melarsomine,</b> histopathological analysis of nodules revealed a switch from neutrophils to eosinophils in oxytetracycline-treated animals, but not following <b>melarsomine</b> treatment, and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) demonstrated that viable Wolbachia were depleted only by oxytetracycline chemotherapy. Eosinophil degranulation increased significantly only in the oxytetracycline group; whereas nodular gene expression of bovine neutrophilic chemokines was lowest in this group. Moreover, intense eosinophil degranulation was initially associated with worm vitality, not degeneration, while transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed subsequent cuticular damage in Wolbachia-depleted worms. Taken together, these data offer strong support for the hypothesis that Wolbachia confers longevity on 0. ochengi through a defensive mutualism, in which neutrophils attracted to Wolbachia divert a potentially lethal effector response by eosinophils.

40|$|Canine dirofilariosis is a {{life-threatening}} parasitic disease {{that is increasingly}} reported worldwide. Once diagnosed the main treatment goals are to improve the animal’s clinical condition and to eliminate all life stages of the parasite with minimal posttreatment side effects. This can be achieved through mechanical, surgical, or chemotherapeutical approaches. Currently, manual extraction is the preferred method to remove adult heartworms due to its diminished invasiveness, reduced damage to the vascular endothelium, and shortened anaesthesia duration. However, it remains an expensive technique that can be highly traumatic. To address this issue, a nontraumatic homemade catheter-guided snare was developed for heartworm removal by adapting and folding a 0. 014 -inch coronary wire (BMW, Abbott Vascular). Transvenous heartworm extraction was performed on a dog severely infected with adult heartworms by inserting the modified snare into a 6 -F Judkins right coronary guiding catheter BMW (Cordis) and advancing it into the right ventricle under fluoroscopic guidance.

Using Onchocerca ochengi, a closely related species which infects cattle and is transmitted by the same black fly vector (Simulium damnosum sensu lato) as O. volvulus, we have conducted longitudinal studies after either natural field exposure or experimental infection to determine whether, and under what circumstances, protective immunity exists in onchocerciasis. On {{the basis of the}} adult worm burdens (nodules) observed, we determined that cattle reared in endemic areas without detectable parasites (putatively immune) were significantly less susceptible to heavy field challenge than age-matched, naive controls (P = 0. 002), whereas patently infected cattle, cured of infection by adulticide treatment with <b>melarsomine,</b> were fully susceptible. Cattle immunized with irradiated third-stage larvae were significantly protected against experimental challenge (100 % reduction in median nodule load, P = 0. 003), and vaccination also conferred resistance to severe and prolonged field challenge (64 % reduction in median nodule load, P = 0. 053; and a significant reduction in microfilarial positivity rates and density, P < 0. 05).

The parasite was isolated and used to produce a soluble antigen for antibody-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in a protocol derived from a method previously developed for sheep and humans but using protein A conjugate. The animals were treated on three instances, alternatively with <b>melarsomine</b> hydrochloride and quinapyramine and followed up on a monthly basis for 2 years with various diagnostic techniques including parasitological, serological and DNA-based methods. Initially, five animals were detected as being positive using ELISA with 83. 3 % concordance to parasitological tests. Immediately after the first treatment, parasites and DNA disappeared in all animals; antibody levels decreased regularly until ELISA became negative 3 - 4 months later. Ten months after the first treatment, parasites and antibodies were detected again in one of the camels previously found to be infected. A retrospective study indicated that the weight of this animal had been underestimated; consequently, it had received underdosages of both trypanocides.

Fourteen stocks were thus isolated and subject to genotyping with PCRs targeting type-specific variant surface glycoprotein genes, mitochondrial minicircles and maxicircles, minisatellite markers and the F 1 -ATP synthase γ subunit gene. Nine stocks corresponded to type A, two stocks were type B and three stocks represented mixed infections between A and B, but not hybrids. One T. evansi type A stock was completely akinetoplastic. Five stocks were adapted to in vitro culture and subjected to a drug sensitivity assay with <b>melarsomine</b> dihydrochloride, diminazene diaceturate, isometamidium chloride and suramin. In vitro adaptation induced some loss of kinetoplasts within 60 days. No correlation between drug sensitivity and absence of the kinetoplast was observed. Sequencing the full coding sequence of the F 1 -ATP synthase γ subunit revealed new type-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms and deletions. This study addresses some limitations of current molecular markers for T. evansi genotyping. Polymorphism within the F 1 -ATP synthase γ subunit gene may provide new markers to identify the T. evansi type that do not rely on variant surface glycoprotein genes or kinetoplast DNA...|$|E
40|$|The filarial parasite, Dirofilaria immitis, infects {{dogs and}} canids in warm and {{tropical}} {{areas of the}} globe. Located in the right pulmonary arteries, the heartworm infection is a severe and potentially fatal disease; caused mainly by the adult worm stages. The zoonotic roundworm is transmitted by various mosquitoes, Culicidae. Currently, control measures are based on monthly prophylaxis with macrocyclic lactones (MLs). The only adulticide treatment is <b>melarsomine</b> dihydrochloride injected intramuscularly which can cause complications. Resistance is emerging against the MLs, increasing the necessity to find novel anthelmintics. The recently discovered class of anthelmintics, amino acetonitriles derivatives (AADs), with a new mode of action brought hope {{in the battle against}} helminth parasites. The aim of this thesis was to find candidate targets of AADs and other potential anthelmintics in D. immitis genome that could be used as therapeutic targets. The first chapter discusses the possible mechanisms of antiparasitic drug action and selectivity. The second chapter tests and confirms the efficacy of AADs against D. immitis in vitro. This suggests the presence of receptor(s) to AADs in the heartworm, a hypothesis which can be tested by genome sequencing. The third chapter narrates the story of the genome project of the heartworm; de novo sequenced with Illumina HiSeq and assembled with Abyss and Velvet. This did not indicate that there is an AAD receptor (DEG- 3 -subfamily), to Caenorhabditis elegans and Haemonchus contortus in D. immitis genome. In fact, D. immitis does not appear to possess a single gene of the DEG- 3 subfamily of acetylcholine receptors, the targets of monepantel. However, in-depth studies of the genome through exclusion criteria established a list of novel potential drug targets. The fourth chapter further investigates the presumed loss of the DEG- 3 -subfamily in D. immitis and relates this finding to the sensitivity against both monepantel enantiomers in vitro and in vivo. The fifth chapter picks up some of the newly identified candidate drug targets. It tests the predicted targets against the heartworm with known inhibitors. This thesis presents a genomic approach to identify potential targets and new anthelmintics. I hope that, the genomic approach will support the development of drugs against the heartworm and related parasites...|$|E
40|$|Heartworm in Canines Kelsey McKenna Faculty Sponsor: Darlene Jones, DVM, Animal Science Each year {{thousands}} of {{dogs in the}} United States become infected with heartworm, which is caused by Dirofilaria immitis. D. immitis is a parasite that is transmitted to dogs via a bite by an infected mosquito. Nine of the seventy competent mosquito species reside in Rhode Island. The true incidence of D. immitis is unknown. Current incidence maps are derived from data generated at veterinary clinics and do not include shelter dogs. The objective {{of this study is}} twofold: to determine the prevalence of D. immitis in shelter populations across the state of Rhode Island and to compare the frequency of heartworm infection in shelter dogs to privately owned dogs. Records were reviewed from three different shelters for the years 2006 through 2010. At each shelter the primary way of testing for heartworm disease was by a 4 Dx SNAP test. Only one of the three shelters tested all dogs, and two of the three shelters tested some of the dogs. If a dog was tested more than once only the initial test was included in the analysis. For the years 2006 through 2010 the heartworm prevalence rate was 2. 06 %, 1. 05 %, 0. 04 %, 1. 0 % and 2. 05 % respectively. When compared to the prevalence of D. immitis in veterinary populations using Pearson’s Chi-Square test (df= 1), there was no statistical significance between the prevalence of heartworm disease in shelter populations and dogs under the care of a veterinarian. It is important to note however, that not all dogs were tested for heartworm disease in all of the Rhode Island shelters. There is a dichotomy between the testing and treatment of owned dogs and shelter populations. The most commonly cited reason for not testing shelter dogs for heartworm disease is lack of funding. Dogs under the care of a veterinarian are usually tested annually for heartworm infection. In open admission shelters, the most common course of action for a heartworm positive dog is to adopt out the dog with the disease or euthanize the dog. If the dog is treated, the protocol closely resembles that of veterinary patients with a few modifications due to lack of funding: <b>melarsomine</b> split-dosing three-dose protocol in addition to an ivermectin treatment. Most veterinary patients also receive doxycycline, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and an opiate analgesic in addition to this treatment. In Rhode Island, the prevalence of heartworm disease in shelter populations follows the trends found in privately owned dogs in veterinary clinics. The data shows that the shelter population may be a sentinel population for Rhode Island dogs. If there is an increase in heartworm in shelter dogs, there may be more potential danger for household pets and proper precautions should be taken...|$|E
40|$|Trypanosoma evansi in Northern Ethiopia: epidemiology, {{diversity}} and alternative diagnostics Animal African trypanosomosis (AAT) {{is a complex}} of parasitic diseases of various domestic and wild animal species caused by different species of trypanosomes. Trypanosoma (T.) brucei, T. congolense and T. vivax are transmitted by tsetse flies. Trypanosoma evansi, but also T. vivax, is mechanically transmitted by other biting flies and T. equiperdum is sexually transmitted in Equidae. All these pathogenic trypanosome species occur in Ethiopia. In particular, surra caused by T. evansi, {{is the number one}} parasitic disease of camel that is the main domestic animal species in many pastoral communities and that may become increasingly important with the current climate change. AAT entails serious economic losses due to mortality, morbidity and reduction in productivity. Compared to tsetse-transmitted AAT, the attention given towards control and research on non-tsetse transmitted animal trypanosomoses (NTTAT) is negligible. This doctoral study {{can be seen as a}} contribution to increase our knowledge on NTTAT due to T. evansi and to attract the attention of policy makers and the international research community for this disease. The study, conducted partly in Ethiopia and partly in Belgium, aimed at 1 ° defining the epidemiological situation of NTTAT in domestic animals in Tigray and Afar regions in Northern Ethiopia, 2 ° isolating trypanosomes from infected animals, 3 ° improving the molecular and serological diagnosis of surra. A cross-sectional epidemiological survey was conducted on 754 dromedary camels, 493 cattle, 264 goats, 181 sheep, 84 donkeys, 25 horses and 10 mules. Overall parasitologically confirmed prevalence of NTTAT was 3. 8 % (68 animals) and was significantly higher in cattle (7. 3 %) than in camels (4. 0 %), sheep (0. 6 %) and goats (0. 4 %). No trypanosomes were detected in equines. Buffy coat samples from parasitologically positive animals were cryostabilised in a special cryomedium for subsequent isolation. Antibody detection with CATT/T. evansi revealed an overall seroprevalence of 19. 6 % with significantly higher seroprevalence in cattle (37. 3 %) than in camels (13. 7 %), goats (13. 3 %), sheep (12. 7 %) and donkeys (10. 7 %). These high seroprevalences could not be confirmed in the immune trypanolysis test (TL) which is considered fully specific for T. evansi. Only part of this discrepancy between both antibody detection tests can be attributed to the presence of T. vivax in the studied animals. The latter species was detected by the TvPRAC PCR in 3. 5 % of the camels, 3. 0 % of the goats, 2. 6 % of the cattle and 2. 2 % of the sheep but not in equines. Two camels and one goat harboured a mixed infection with T. evansi and T. vivax. Overall molecular prevalence of T. evansi type A, assessed with RoTat 1. 2 PCR, was 8. 0 % and was significantly higher in horses (28. 0 %), mules (10. 0 %) and camels (11. 7 %) than in cattle (6. 1 %), donkeys (6. 0 %), goats (3. 8 %) and sheep (2. 2 %). Four camels, all from Awash Fentale district in Afar, were positive in the T. evansi type B specific EVAB PCR thus providing the first molecular evidence of T. evansi type B in Northern Ethiopia. All four were negative in CATT/T. evansi and TL although one of them was also positive in RoTat 1. 2 PCR suggesting a mixed infection. The higher serological prevalence as compared to the molecular prevalence of T. evansi, particularly in ruminants, could be explained by the fact that antibody detection tests like CATT/T. evansi, cannot distinguish current from cured infection and that during chronic infections, parasitaemia can be far below the detection limit of parasitological and molecular tests. Also, the CATT/T. evansi can cross-react with other infections. Among the 68 parasitologically positive animals, 34 were negative in T. evansi and T. vivax specific PCRs and were checked with ITS 1 -PCR for the possibility of infections with T. theileri and T. congolense. Two bovine were positive for T. theileri and no animal was positive for T. congolense. The isolation of trypanosomes from the 68 parasitologically positive buffy coat samples from 36 cattle, 30 camels, 1 sheep and 1 goat was conducted in immunosuppressed mice and yielded 22 T. evansi stocks, all from camels. Not surprisingly, no T. vivax stocks could be isolated in the mouse model. Typing by PCR on the original buffy coats revealed 20 T. evansi type A (positive in RoTat 1. 2 PCR) and 2 T. evansi type B (positive in EVAB PCR). Twelve of the type A stocks and both type B stocks were brought to Belgium for further investigation, included adaptation to in vitro culture for in vitro drug sensitivity testing. After in vivo expansion, and re-typing, nine stocks were confirmed as type A, two as type B and three stocks appeared to be mixed infections with both types. One T. evansi type A stock was akinetoplastic, i. e. had lost its mitochondrial DNA consisting of concatenated circular DNA densely packed in an organelle called kinetoplast. While expansion in mice allowed to propagate the mixed infections, in vitro culture was selective for T. evansi type B. Furthermore, multiple in vitro passages induced the loss of the kinetoplast in some stocks but infectivity to mice was not affected. In vitro drug sensitivity assays with <b>melarsomine</b> dihydrochloride, diminazene diaceturate, isometamidium chloride and suramin revealed no resistance against these trypanocidal drugs in the five in vitro adapted stock from Northern Ethiopia. In order to address some limitations of the current molecular tests for typing T. evansi, the gene of the F 1 -ATP synthase g subunit of eight Northern Ethiopian T. evansi stocks and some other reference strains was sequenced. Type-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and deletions observed within this gene, may provide new markers to identify the T. evansi type that do not rely on variant surface glycoprotein, genes or kinetoplast DNA. In addition, MORF- 2 REP analysis indicated two distinct allelic profiles in T. evansi type A stocks and that they are different from the Indonesian RoTat 1. 2 reference strain. The MORF- 2 REP allelic profiles showed that the Northern Ethiopian T. evansi type B stocks are distinct from the Kenyan T. evansi type B. Control of AAT relies on detection of infected animals followed by administration of trypanocidal drugs. In routine practice, diagnosis of surra is limited to the observation of unspecific clinical signs. If at all applied, parasitological techniques that are commonly used for the diagnosis of surra have limited sensitivity and molecular diagnostics are simply not adapted for routine diagnosis in developing countries. Therefore, serodiagnosis by means of detection of T. evansi-specific antibodies, for example with the Card Agglutination Test for T. evansi (CATT/T. evansi), ELISA or immune trypanolysis (TL), is recommended by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Among these test, only CATT/T. evansi can be applied in the field although it is still dependent on electricity to run the rotator and to respect the cold chain needed to preserve the quality of the antigen. As such, CATT/T. evansi does not fully comply with the ASSURED (affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid, equipment-free and delivered) criteria of a diagnostic test required in the 21 st century. Moreover, it is produced with native antigens purified from trypanosomes grown in laboratory animals. Recently, an alternative antibody detection test for serodiagnosis of T. evansi infection, the Surra Sero K-SeT, was developed by ITM and Coris BioConcept, a Belgian diagnostic company. Surra Sero K-SeT is an immunochromatographic test (ICT) where the antigen consists of an N-terminal fragment of RoTat 1. 2 VSG, recombinantly expressed in Pichia pastoris. In this doctoral study, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of Surra Sero K-SeT and CATT/T. evansi with TL as reference test by testing sera from 300 camels, 100 water buffaloes, 100 horses, 82 bovines, 88 sheep, 99 dogs and 37 alpacas. The Surra Sero K-SeT displayed considerably higher sensitivity than CATT/T. evansi (98. 1 % versus 84. 4 %) but somewhat lower specificity (94. 8 % versus 98. 3 %). In particular and for unknown reasons, the specificity with the alpaca sera was disappointingly low (83. 8 %). Unfortunately, we were not able to test the Surra Sero K-SeT on sera from camels infected with T. evansi type B but we hypothesize that it cannot detect type B infections thus jeopardising its diagnostic potential in countries where T. evansi type B is present, like Kenya, Ethiopia and possibly Sudan. In conclusion, this doctoral study revealed that, in terms of prevalence, NTTAT due to T. evansi type A and type B and T. vivax, is an important threat to animal health in Tigray and Afar and not only in camel and cattle but also in small ruminants and equines. Control of AAT, in Ethiopia and elsewhere, should therefore not only focus on tsetse transmitted trypanosomes and should take into consideration the role of small ruminants and equines in the epidemiology of the disease. This study allowed us to establish an important new collection of T. evansi stocks from Northern Ethiopia, including, two T. evansi type B stocks. Genetic characterization of these stocks may eventually lead to an improved genetic marker for type B, based on SNPs in the F 1 -ATP g-subunit gene. In order to adapt the Surra Sero K-SeT so that it can detect T. evansi type B infections, other candidate invariable antigens and other expression systems should be investigated.
