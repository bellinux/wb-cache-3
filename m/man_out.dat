5|$|Australia {{was still}} some way behind when Lindwall {{replaced}} Johnson, and 15 runs later, Yardley bowled Loxton for 93, while Saggers only managed five, leaving Australia at 355/8 with only Johnston and Toshack remaining. Lindwall hit out, scoring 77 in an innings marked by powerful driving and pulling, dominating stands of 48 and 55 with Johnston and Toshack respectively. He {{was the last}} <b>man</b> <b>out</b> at 458, leaving Australia 38 runs in arrears on the first innings. Bedser took the final wicket to end with 3/92. Laker took 3/113, while Pollard and Yardley ended with two wickets each.|$|E
5|$|Brodie and Hall {{opened the}} Port Phillip second innings; they added 12 {{in ten minutes}} before Brodie was caught at long off by Tabart and was {{replaced}} by Hamilton. Hall was dismissed leg before wicket from the bowling of McDowall shortly afterwards for six. Lister was caught off the bowling of Field for three and Henty bowled Thomas for a duck. William Phillpot was run out by Tabart for three and Cooper was bowled by Henty for a duck, the fifth <b>man</b> <b>out</b> with the score on 28. Wickets continued to fall, although Hamilton was batting well at the other end. Roger Phillpot, who scored just a single, was caught by Westbrook off Henty; Marsden was bowled by McDowall for two and Hervey bowled by Henty for one. Meanwhile, Hamilton had batted for an hour to score 35 runs, the highest individual score of the match; he was last <b>man</b> <b>out,</b> leg before wicket to McDowall to end the innings for 57 runs. The innings had lasted 17 overs and taken 80 minutes. The other batsmen had contributed 21 runs (one bye was scored) between them. Henty took five for 26 and McDowall returned figures of three for 21. Van Diemen's Land required 36 runs to win.|$|E
5|$|Brown partnered the {{recovered}} Barnes and patiently scored 140, {{before being}} the fifth <b>man</b> <b>out</b> with the score at 344, as Australia amassed 456 and defeated Derbyshire by an innings {{immediately after the}} Fourth Test. Looking to regain his Test position by sheer weight of runs, Brown started slowly; Barnes made 24 of the first 29 runs. He took 185 minutes to reach 50, much to the displeasure of the restless spectators, before accelerating and scoring his next 50 runs in 37 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the match}} against the MCC, {{there were four}} more county {{fixtures}} before the First Test, against Lancashire, Nottinghamshire, Hampshire and Sussex. Australia drew the first two before winning the latter two by eight wickets and an innings and 325 runs respectively. Tallon played in only the Nottinghamshire match, taking two catches in the first innings and two stumpings {{in each of the}} innings. The catches were all from Lindwall and the stumpings from Doug Ring. Tallon conceded 18 byes for the match and scored 27, being last <b>man</b> <b>out</b> at 400 after coming to the crease at 6/355. In Saggers's three matches, 36 byes were conceded and six dismissals were made.|$|E
5|$|From {{his base}} in Tel Aviv, Holocaust {{survivor}} Emmanuel Lieber directs {{a group of}} Jewish Nazi hunters in search of Adolf Hitler. Lieber believes that the former Führer is still alive, and following rumours and hearsay, he tracks Hitler's movements through South America. After months of wading through swamps in the Amazon jungle, the search party finds the 90-year-old alive in a clearing. Lieber flies to San Cristóbal where he awaits the group's return with their captive. But getting the old <b>man</b> <b>out</b> of the jungle alive is more difficult than getting in, and their progress is further hampered by heavy thunderstorms.|$|E
5|$|In England's second innings, Gooch {{played a}} lone hand. With the {{exception}} of Foster (34), promoted as nightwatchman {{at the end of}} day two, no-one else passed 15. When Gooch was last <b>man</b> <b>out</b> for 84 on the third day, England had compiled 202. The England bowlers managed to restrain the West Indian batsmen, Childs notably bowling 40 overs for just 79 runs, but, with more than two days left to play, there was little pressure on the West Indies, and they strolled to victory in 91 overs, losing just two wickets, with more than a day to spare.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{was still}} some way behind when Lindwall {{replaced}} Johnson. Fifteen runs later, Yardley bowled Loxton for 93, while Saggers only managed five {{in his first}} Test innings before being stumped after being lured out of his crease by Laker. This left Australia at 355/8 with only Johnston and Toshack remaining. Lindwall hit out, scoring 77, an innings marked by powerful driving and pulling, dominating in stands of 48 and 55 with Johnston and Toshack respectively. Of the 103 added {{for the last two}} wickets, Johnston and Toshack managed only 25 between them. Lindwall was the last <b>man</b> <b>out</b> at 458, leaving Australia 38 runs in arrears on the first innings. Australia added only one run to its overnight score of 457/9, with Bedser taking the final wicket to end with 3/92. Laker took 3/113, while Pollard and Yardley ended with two wickets each.|$|E
5|$|Bangladesh's second innings {{started in}} similar fashion to their first; they lost the early wicket of Imrul Kayes, and Tamim scored a quick half-century. The latter was dropped three times before being caught by Broad for 52 runs. Junaid and Jahurul both made good starts for Bangladesh, but were out for 34 and 43 respectively, which along with low scores for Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur left Bangladesh on 172 for six {{at the end of}} the fourth day. On the final morning, Shakib batted {{resiliently}} with the lower-order batsmen and narrowly missed out on a century; he was the last <b>man</b> <b>out,</b> stumped attempting to score a boundary to reach the landmark. His batting had helped establish a 208 run lead for Bangladesh, which resulted in England requiring just under four runs per over to reach the total.|$|E

5|$|In reply, Australia {{were still}} more than 100 runs behind when Johnston joined Lindwall with the score at 8/355, late on the third day. Lindwall hit out, scoring 77 in an innings marked by {{powerful}} driving and pulling, dominating the stand of 48 with Johnston, who made only 13. Johnston accompanied Lindwall for 80 minutes, before the injured Ernie Toshack survived the last 50 minutes until stumps, with Johnston running for him. Despite Toshack and Johnston’s lack of familiarity with having and acting as a runner respectively, and the resulting disorders in running between the wickets, Lindwall was able to manipulate the strike so he faced most of the balls. Johnston able to survive against the English pacemen with relative ease when he was batting, leading O’Reilly to lament the absence of leg spinner Doug Wright, whose guile and flight was held in high regard by the Australians. Lindwall was the last <b>man</b> <b>out</b> on the fourth morning with the total on 458, leaving Australia 38 runs in arrears on the first innings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} Test of the 2009 Ashes at the SWALEC Stadium in Cardiff, Collingwood scored 64 {{in the first}} innings as England totalled 435. On a flat wicket, however, this was put into context by the Australians, who amassed 674 for 6 declared, with four centurions; Collingwood bowled nine overs, and claimed the wicket of Brad Haddin caught at deep midwicket. In reply, England slid to 70 for 5 and seemed certain to succumb to an innings defeat. In response, Collingwood stayed at the crease for 5¾ hours (nearly {{the whole of the}} final day) and top-scored for England with 74 runs from 245 balls. He was ninth <b>man</b> <b>out,</b> edging Peter Siddle to gully, but final pair James Anderson and Monty Panesar blocked out the final 11½ overs of the match to secure an {{improbable}} draw.|$|E
5|$|Loitering munitions {{that are}} capable of making {{autonomous}} attack decisions (<b>man</b> <b>out</b> of the loop) raise moral, ethical, and international humanitarian law concerns because a human being is not involved in making the actual decision to attack and potentially kill humans. Whereas some guided munitions may lock-on after launch or may be sensor fuzed, their flight time is typically limited and a human launches them at an area where enemy activity is strongly suspected. An autonomous loitering munition, on the other hand, may be launched at an area where enemy activity is only probable, and loiter searching autonomously for targets for potentially hours following the initial launch decision. The IAI Harpy and IAI Harop are frequently cited in the relevant literature as they set a precedent for an aerial system (though not necessarily a precedent when comparing to a modern naval mine) in terms of length and quality of autonomous function, in relation to a cruise missile for example.|$|E

5|$|Sunday was a rest day, and {{the match}} resumed on Monday morning. In the third over of the day, Lindwall {{was the last}} <b>man</b> <b>out</b> at 458, leaving Australia 38 runs in arrears on the first innings. Bradman's men had added only one run to its {{overnight}} score of 457/9. Bedser took the final wicket as Lindwall edged, and Crapp took the catch low down in the slips with his left hand. Bedser ended with 3/92 and Laker 3/113, while Pollard and Yardley ended with two wickets each. England's use of Cranston as an all rounder had not been successful; he conceded almost four runs per over without taking a wicket. Although England only had a slight lead, Australia had the disadvantage of being a bowler short due to Toshack's injury. This meant Johnston and Johnson among the slower bowlers were left to exploit the wearing pitch.|$|E
5|$|The trial resumed on March 4, 2013 with testimonies from expert {{witnesses}} {{in the fields of}} criminal psychology (Tereza Soukupová, appointed by the court) and psychiatry (Alena Gayová, appointed by the defense). Blythe returned to attend the hearings in person, even though the presiding judge had told him that at this point they may be undertaken in his absence. The two {{expert witnesses}} agreed that Blythe is not aggressive; nevertheless, he may have issues with controlling his emotions under stress. The court further heard testimonies from two eyewitnesses. One of them was a bodyguard who was present at the concert but did not see the fall. He testified that when by the exit, he saw two men taking a third <b>man</b> <b>out</b> of the building to fresh air. He said that he was told by them that the person fell off the stage.

5|$|Through June 12, Zito was 7–2 with a 3.10 ERA. After {{a strong}} {{start to the}} season, Zito regressed down the stretch, going 2–12 with a 4.97 ERA {{the rest of the}} way. He {{finished}} the season 9–14 with a 4.15 ERA, snapping a streak of nine straight seasons in which he had 10 or more wins. In a rotation featuring Tim Lincecum, Matt Cain, Jonathan Sánchez, and Madison Bumgarner, Zito was the odd <b>man</b> <b>out</b> for the playoffs. In fact, he was left completely off the Giants' 25-man active roster for the postseason. Zito worked out throughout the playoffs so that he would be ready to join the roster in case of an injury, but he was never needed and remained on the secondary squad. Nevertheless, he won his first World Series ring {{as a member of the}} full roster.|$|E
