2500|$|To model job performance, {{researchers}} {{have attempted to}} define a set of dimensions that are common to all jobs. Using {{a common set of}} dimensions provides a consistent basis for assessing performance and enables the comparison of performance across jobs. Performance is commonly broken into two major categories: in-role (technical aspects of a job) and extra-role (non-technical abilities such as communication skills and being a good team member). While this distinction in behavior has been challenged it is commonly made by both employees and management. A model of performance by Campbell breaks performance into in-role and extra-role categories. Campbell labeled job-specific task proficiency and non-job-specific task proficiency as in-role dimensions, while written and oral communication, demonstrating effort, maintaining personal discipline, facilitating peer and team performance, supervision and leadership and management and administration are labeled as extra-role dimensions. Murphy's model of job performance also broke job performance into in-role and extra-role categories. However, task-orientated behaviors composed the in-role category and the extra-role category included interpersonally-oriented behaviors, down-time behaviors and destructive and hazardous behaviors. However, it has been challenged as to whether the measurement of job performance is usually done through pencil/paper tests, job skills tests, on-site hands-on tests, off-site hands-on tests, high-fidelity simulations, symbolic simulations, task ratings and global ratings. These various tools are often used to evaluate performance on specific tasks and overall job performance. Van Dyne and LePine developed a <b>measurement</b> <b>model</b> in which overall job performance was evaluated using Campbell's in-role and extra-role categories. Here, in-role performance was reflected through how well [...] "employees met their performance expectations and performed well at the tasks that made up the employees' job." [...] Dimensions regarding how well the employee assists others with their work {{for the benefit of the}} group, if the employee voices new ideas for projects or changes to procedure and whether the employee attends functions that help the group composed the extra-role category.|$|E
40|$|Traditional <b>models</b> of {{conjoint}} <b>measurement</b> {{look for}} an additive representation of transitive preferences. They have been generalized in two directions. Nontransitive additive conjoint <b>measurement</b> <b>models</b> allow for nontransitive preferences while retaining the additivity feature of traditional <b>models.</b> Decomposable conjoint <b>measurement</b> <b>models</b> are transitive but replace additivity by a mere decomposability requirement. This paper presents generalizations of conjoint <b>measurement</b> <b>models</b> combining these two aspects. This allows us to propose a simple axiomatic treatment that shows the pure consequences of several cancellation conditions used in traditional models.
