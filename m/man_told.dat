5|$|In 1924 Gerard Olivier, a habitually frugal <b>man,</b> <b>told</b> his {{son that}} not only must he gain {{admission}} to the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art, but he must also gain a scholarship with a bursary to cover his tuition fees and living expenses. Olivier's sister had been a student there and was a favourite of Elsie Fogerty, the founder and principal of the school. Olivier later speculated that {{it was on the}} strength of this that Fogerty agreed to award him the bursary.|$|E
5|$|Henry Gerber and the Society for Human Rights {{serve as}} direct {{links between the}} LGBT-related {{activism}} of the Weimar Republic and the American homophile movement of the 1950s. In 1929, {{a young man named}} Harry Hay was living in Los Angeles. He soon discovered the cruising scene in Pershing Square, where he met Champ Simmons, {{a man who had been}} a lover of one of Gerber's Society compatriots. This <b>man</b> <b>told</b> Hay about the Society's brief history, warning Hay of the futility of trying to organize gay men. Although Hay would later deny that he had any knowledge of previous LGBT activism, he was inspired by this knowledge to conceive in 1948 a proposal for a gay men's political and social group. In 1950 Hay's idea reached fruition when he and several other men founded the Mattachine Society, the first enduring LGBT rights organization in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Whether the PAVN 2nd Division {{had been}} {{rendered}} ineffective or not was uncertain, as U.S. military intelligence {{did not know}} the whereabouts of the enemy unit or their intentions. Since January 1968, the North Vietnamese had been fighting continuously with U.S. and other allied military forces in I Corps, so their resupply capabilities were overstretched, and their soldiers were not given the opportunity to rest before the Tet Offensive. Thus, following the failed attack on Đà Nẵng, North Vietnamese General Chu Huy Mân, Commander of Military Region 5, made the decision to pull the 2nd Division into the mountains where they could rest, resupply, and integrate their replacement manpower before going on the offensive again. Mân ordered Cương to split the 2nd Division into two fighting arms; one regiment would tie down the Americans in the Que Son Valley, {{while the rest of the}} division would withdraw to their base areas near Laos, to link up with the 70th Transport Regiment. Then, their next target would be Khâm Đức and the surrounding areas; <b>Mân</b> <b>told</b> his senior officers that they would attack Khâm Đức to force an American retreat.|$|E

25|$|A <b>man</b> <b>told</b> Umar, while Umar was {{en route}} to his planned {{assassination}} of Muhammad, that he should deal with his sister who had secretly converted to Islam. He then rushed to his sister's place, and heard her reciting the Qur'an. He considered the words beautiful and noble, and immediately converted to Islam. He made his conversion public instantly, even to the most hostile Quraysh. The effect of Umar's conversion was that Muslims could now pray openly at the Ka'ba, as the pagans were reluctant to confront Umar, known for his forceful character.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, late {{at night}} on Tuesday, May 7, a 45-year-old black man named Herbert Thomas was flagged down by a {{hitchhiker}} in Kilgore. The man said that he needed a ride to Henderson because his mother was seriously ill and offered $5. Thomas {{said that he would}} not have given the man a ride but felt like he needed to because the <b>man</b> <b>told</b> such a sad story. When they neared Henderson, the man pulled out a pistol and told Thomas to keep driving or he would kill him like the five people he killed in Texarkana, mentioning Paul Martin and Betty Jo Booker by name. The <b>man</b> <b>told</b> Thomas that he was not done killing and was planning on killing more. He {{said he was going to}} return to Texarkana and kill Martin's father. The suspect apparently did not know that Martin's father was already dead. The man then made Thomas stop in Lufkin and told him to drive back to Kilgore and that if he followed him, he would trail him and kill him. The man stole back the $5 as well as an additional $3. Thomas drove back to Kilgore and reported the incident to the police. Thomas described the man as being 5'8, about 130pounds, approximately 27 or 28 years old, with red hair and wore khaki trousers and a GI jacket.|$|E

25|$|In 1435, Elijah of Ferrara recounted meeting an Ethiopian Jew in Jerusalem in {{a letter}} to his children. The <b>man</b> <b>told</b> him of the ongoing {{conflict}} of his independent nation with the Christian Habesha; he relayed some of the principals of his faith, which, Ferrara concluded, balanced between Karaite and Rabbinical Judaism. His people were not familiar with the Talmud and did not observe Hanukkah, but their canon contained the book of Esther and they had an oral interpretation of the Torah. Ferrara further recorded that they had their own language, that the journey from their land lasted six months, and that the biblical Gozan river was found within their borders.|$|E
25|$|Crystal Meth {{is to be}} Method Man's {{upcoming}} {{fifth and}} final studio album. The album has no confirmed release date. The Crystal Meth album was first announced before Method Man began working on his and Redman's sophomore collaboration album, Blackout! 2, during which time it was tentatively titled The Crystal Method. In the liner notes of that album, it was given a scheduled release date for 2009. The album, however, was further postponed until it was later mentioned in an MTV interview it would be released in early 2010. At a concert on December 23, 2010, Method <b>Man</b> <b>told</b> the crowd to look for his album in March 2011. However, the album was postponed again.|$|E
25|$|In Ibn Fadlan's {{eyewitness}} {{account of a}} Viking funeral, there is {{a description of a}} slave girl who was to be sacrificed and who had to undergo several sexual rites. When the chieftain had been put in the ship, she went from tent to tent where she visited warriors and traders. Every <b>man</b> <b>told</b> her that they did what they did for their love to the dead chieftain. Lastly, she entered a tent that had been raised on the ship, and in it six men had intercourse with her before she was strangled and stabbed. The sexual rites with the slave girl show that she was considered to be a vessel for the transmission of life force to the deceased chieftain.|$|E

25|$|Roman is {{the leader}} of the Dark Signers. He {{possesses}} a birthmark resembling the Spider Nazca line and can use it send out spiders that can possess civilians, turning them into Dark Signers, and giving them Shadow powers and Dark Tuner and Synchro Monsters. The spiders can also be used as a means of surveillance, reporting all they have found once they return to their owner. Roman reveals himself to be Rex Goodwin's big brother and an assistant to Professor Fudo (Yusei's Father), until he met a mysterious man from Yliaster. The <b>man</b> <b>told</b> him to look into Ener-D's light and learn about the Earthbound Immortals' battle against the Crimson Dragon. Though revealed to be the Fifth Signer, Roman betrays Professor Fudo and causes the Zero Reverse incident after ripping his own arm off and giving it to Rex, telling him to unite the Signers. The resulting explosion transforms Roman into a Dark Signer.|$|E
500|$|According to Lori Haskell, {{the second}} <b>man</b> <b>told</b> the ticket agent: [...] "We {{need to get}} this man on the plane. He doesn't have a passport." [...] The ticket agent said nobody was allowed to board without a passport. The well-dressed man replied: [...] "We do this all the time; he's from Sudan." [...] Lori Haskell said {{the two men were}} {{directed}} down a corridor, to talk to a manager. [...] "We never saw him again until he tried to blow up our plane," [...] Lori Haskell said of Abdulmutallab.|$|E
500|$|Gröning led {{a normal}} middle-class {{life after the}} war. A keen stamp collector, he was once at his local philately club's annual meeting, more than 40 years after the war, when he fell into a {{conversation}} about politics with {{the man next to}} him. The <b>man</b> <b>told</b> him it was [...] "terrible" [...] that Holocaust denial was illegal in Germany, and went on to tell Gröning how so many bodies could not have been burnt, and that the volume of gas that {{was supposed to have been}} used would have killed all living things in the vicinity.|$|E

500|$|To help {{increase}} their positive publicity, Island Records hired the Nasty Little Man publicity team. The team {{set up a}} photo shoot for Insane Clown Posse that was {{to appear on the}} cover of Alternative Press magazine in Cleveland. On the set of the photo shoot, a member of the publicity team approached Bruce and explained that in the song [...] "Fuck the World", the lyric that stated [...] "Fuck the Beastie Boys and the Dalai Lama" [...] needed to be changed. Insulted, Bruce exclaimed that his music would not be censored again – referring to Disney's previous requirement of censure. Nasty Little <b>Man</b> <b>told</b> Bruce that the Beastie Boys were not only clients of the company but also personal friends, and the Beastie Boys told the company to make Bruce change the lyric. In response, Bruce fired Nasty Little Man and asked its team to leave the photo shoot.|$|E
500|$|Amid this tension, Willkie and Roosevelt met for {{the first}} time, at the White House on December 13, 1934. [...] The meeting was {{outwardly}} cordial, but each <b>man</b> <b>told</b> his own version of what occurred: the president boasted of having outtalked Willkie, while the executive sent a soon-to-be-famous telegram to his wife: [...] "CHARM OVERRATED... I DIDNT TELL HIM WHAT YOU THINK OF HIM" [...] Roosevelt decided that the utility holding companies had to be broken up, stated so in his 1935 State of the Union address and met with Willkie later in January to inform him of his intent. In the meantime, the companies did their best to sabotage the TVA; farmers were told by corporate representatives that lines from the new Norris Dam could not carry enough power to make a light bulb glow, and the company ran [...] "spite lines" [...] that might not even carry power in an effort to invoke the non-compete agreement over broad areas.|$|E
500|$|Kvinneakt {{is often}} {{referred}} to as the most notorious of the sculptures installed in the Transit Mall during the 1970s. In addition to being somewhat controversial because it is a nude, the sculpture has also received mixed reviews as a work of art. In 1981, Taylor recalled that following the sculpture's first installation one <b>man</b> <b>told</b> him that [...] "he ought to be ashamed of himself." [...] In 1985, Jeff Kuechle of The Oregonian listed the work as one of the city's [...] "worst sculptures". In the article, Claire Kelly, director of Portland State University's art and architecture program said, [...] "She's more than simplistic, she's absurd. It's not a piece that belongs on public display." [...] In contrast, Monk Magazine described the sculpture as [...] "the best-looking girl in Portland" [...] with [...] "her stunning eyes and voluptuous figure". [...] According to the magazine, Portland is the only city in the United States with a [...] "flasher statue". [...] The sculpture was included in Kate Chynoweth's 2003 book, The Best Places to Kiss in the Northwest: A Romantic Travel Guide, as one of Portland's [...] "romantic highlights".|$|E
60|$|The poor {{creature}} {{was not only}} starved with hunger, and terrified with the thoughts of death, but, as the <b>men</b> <b>told</b> us afterwards, was broken-hearted for her mistress, whom she saw dying {{two or three days}} before, and whom she loved most tenderly.|$|R
60|$|The {{details of}} the {{expedition}} were now discussed and arranged, and the <b>men</b> <b>told</b> off to their various duties, and at eleven o'clock at night, when all in the town were fast asleep, the party quitted the bivouac and marched down again to the port.|$|R
60|$|The {{gratitude}} {{they expressed}} for our kindly using {{the two young}} women I have mentioned, was a token of generous principles; and our <b>men</b> <b>told</b> us, {{that they would have}} given them whatever they could have asked, that was in their power to bestow.|$|R
500|$|Meanwhile, the thrall girl {{went from}} one tent {{to the other}} and had sexual {{intercourse}} with the men. Every <b>man</b> <b>told</b> her: [...] "Tell your master that I did this because of my love to him". In the afternoon, they moved the thrall girl to something that looked like a door frame, where she was lifted on the palms of the men three times. Every time, the girl told them what she saw. The first time, she saw her father and mother, the second time, she saw all her relatives, and the third time she saw her master in the afterworld. There, it was green and beautiful and together with him, she saw men and young boys. She saw that her master beckoned for her. By using intoxicating drinks, they thought to put the thrall girl in an ecstatic trance that made her psychic and through the symbolic action with the door frame, she would then see into the realm of the dead. The same ritual also appears in the Icelandic short story [...] "Völsa þáttr," [...] where two pagan Norwegian men lift the lady of the household over a door frame to help her look into the otherworld.|$|E
500|$|The same episode {{reveals that}} by the early 1960s he was an US Army Captain {{involved}} in black ops and intelligence, and that he served alongside Fox Mulder's father, Bill. The Smoking Man was already involved in the arming of anti-Castro rebels in Cuba and the assassinations of Patrice Lumumba and Rafael Trujillo before he was enlisted by a secret cabal to assassinate President John Fitzgerald Kennedy in Dallas. The assassination was motivated by Kennedy's mishandling of the Bay of Pigs Invasion and the subsequent Cuban Missile Crisis. As part of the mission, the Smoking <b>Man</b> <b>told</b> the designated patsy, Lee Harvey Oswald, to bring the curtain rods {{as a way to}} frame him for the murder. Incidentally, it was Oswald himself who introduced the Smoking Man to cigarettes. By 1968, the Smoking Man had progressed enough in the hierarchy to push himself for the assassination of Martin Luther King, concerned that King was [...] "talking like a Maoist" [...] and a threat to the American war effort in Vietnam. He did the deed himself because he had [...] "too much respect for the man," [...] and chose to frame a white racist because of his own sympathy for black civil rights.|$|E
500|$|Jervis {{could also}} be {{exceptionally}} kind when {{he felt that the}} situation warranted it. On one occasion, while the fleet was becalmed the men of the flagship were ordered to bathe. The men leapt over the side to swim in a sail that had been lowered over the side. One of the men, a senior able seaman, jumped in wearing his trousers. In one of the pockets he had his prize money and back pay that he had been saving for several years. The bank notes were destroyed by the water and when the man came aboard and discovered what had happened he began to weep. The Admiral saw the man and asked the problem. One of his officers told him and St Vincent went to his cabin. When he returned he had the crew mustered and called the man forward. [...] "Roger Odell you are convicted, Sir, by your own appearance of tarnishing the British oak with tears. What have you to say in your defence why you should not receive what you deserve?" [...] The <b>man</b> <b>told</b> him what had happened and St Vincent replied [...] "Roger Odell {{you are one of the}} best men in this ship you are moreover a captain of a top and in my life I never saw a man behave himself better in battle than you did in the Victory in the action with the Spanish fleet. To show therefore that your Commander-in-chief will never pass over merit wheresoever he may find it. There is your money Sir!" [...] The Earl produced £70 of his own money and presented it to the surprised sailor [...] "but no more tears mind, no more tears Sir".|$|E
500|$|In an {{emotional}} press conference, <b>Manning</b> <b>told</b> Colts fans, [...] "Thank you {{for letting me}} be your quarterback."

60|$|Our <b>men</b> <b>told</b> {{them they}} must be {{contented}} to remain on shore, where they were, for some time, for {{that they could do}} nothing till they had been on board, and acquainted their captain with all the particulars; so they came back immediately to me for orders.|$|R
60|$|Don't you see? Our truth, {{the very}} truth we told, was our damnation.
