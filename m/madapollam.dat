In 1690, the East India Company purchased a promontory from Shahuji I, the , where they built Fort St. David, near Cuddalore. By 1700, there were English factories at Porto Novo, <b>Madapollam,</b> Vizagapatam, Anjengo, Tellicherry and Calicut.|$|E
30|$|We use AgNO 3 and CuSO 4 · 5 H 2 O from Aldrich. Gauze and <b>madapollam</b> fabrics {{were used}} as cotton samples. The surface of gauze is 36  g/m 2 and that of <b>madapollam</b> is 94  g/m 2.|$|E
30|$|Bactericide {{action of}} Ag NPs and BMNP {{are shown in}} Table 1. The samples of Ag-modified gauze and <b>madapollam</b> samples {{effectively}} kill the harmful bacteria and fungi. In the last two columns of Table 1, the results of bactericide activity of Ag NPs on the dispersive silica surface {{as well as of}} aqueous solution of colloidal silver obtained by us early are shown for comparison. Apparently, the activity of the obtained fabrics is comparable with such for Ag NPs in a colloid and on the developed surface of dispersive silica. Thus, advantages of fabrics are the substitution of noble metal silver on copper, simplicity of their production and storage, stability after washing, and maintenance of bactericidal action for a long time.|$|E
30|$|Natural fabrics like gauze or <b>madapollam</b> were {{impregnated}} with {{mixture of}} water solutions AgNO 3 and CuSO 4 with ratio Ag:Cu[*]=[*] 1 : 1 within the fabric, then squeezed thoroughly and evenly ironed at 200 – 220  °С during 5 – 10  min. In fabrics with BMNP, ratio of Ag:Cu is equal within 0.015 – 0.13  wt% (15 – 70  ppm) {{depending on the}} concentration of initial impregnating solutions. These amounts were determined on the correlation of area under maximum absorption spectrum by Gaussian expansion. A calibration was performed as dependence of corresponding area and intensity of SPR spectrum on silver amount calculated from an adsorption isotherm. Fabric is dyed in a red-brownish color; the tint of {{that depends on the}} amount of the appearance of the metal on the unit of textile surface. Red-brownish tint appears because of the formation of protoxide and oxide of copper. The production of bactericidal fabrics by the ironed wet materials with the metal ions at a temperature near 200 – 220  °С does not require the use of chemical reductant and prolonged warming up; the surface of press is not painted and not corroded, allowing to save time and facilities at the production of material.|$|E
