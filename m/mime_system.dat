40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} kinematics of a four degree-of-freedom upper extremity rehabilitation robot for stroke therapy, {{to be used in}} conjunction with the Mirror Image Move-ment Enabler (<b>MIME)</b> <b>system.</b> The RiceWrist is intended to pro-vide robotic therapy via force-feedback during range-of-motion tasks. The exoskeleton device accommodates forearm supina-tion and pronation, wrist flexion and extension, and radial and ulnar deviation in a compact design with low friction and back-lash. Joint range of motion and torque output of the electric-motor driven device is matched to human capabilities. The pa-per describes the design of the device, along with three control modes that allow for various methods of interaction between the patient and the robotic device. Passive, triggered, and active-constrained modes, such as those developed for MIME, allow for therapist control of therapy protocols based on patient capability and progress. Also presented is the graphical user interface for therapist control of the interactions modes of the RiceWrist, basic experimental protocol, and preliminary experimental results...|$|E

An optimum transmission scheme uses Shannon's principle of waterfilling jointly {{in the frequency}} and the spatial domain. However, we show in this paper that the largest gain by using waterfilling resides in the spatial domain, and that the capacity gain from the frequency domain is very small for <b>MIMe</b> <b>systems.</b> We quantify the gain for a theoretical Rayleigh fading chan- nel model and for microcellular channels as measured in an enclosed court-yard...|$|R
50|$|MIME {{types are}} widely used in many Internet-related applications, and {{increasingly}} elsewhere, although their usage for on-disc type information is rare. These consist of a standardised system of identifiers (managed by IANA) consisting of a type and a sub-type, separated by a slash - for instance, text/html or image/gif. These were originally intended {{as a way of}} identifying what type of file was attached to an e-mail, independent of the source and target operating <b>systems.</b> <b>MIME</b> types identify files on BeOS, AmigaOS 4.0 and MorphOS, as well as store unique application signatures for application launching. In AmigaOS and MorphOS the <b>Mime</b> type <b>system</b> works in parallel with Amiga specific Datatype system.|$|R

40|$|Multiple-input multiple-output (<b>MIMe)</b> antenna <b>systems</b> employ spatial {{multiplexing}} {{to increase}} spectral efficiency or transmit diversity to improve link reliability. The performance of these signaling strategies is {{highly dependent on}} MIMe channel characteristics which in turn depend on an- tenna height and spacing and richness of scattering. In practice, large antenna spacings are often required to achieve significant multiplexing or diversity gains. The use of dual-polarized antennas (polarization diversity) is a promising cost- and space-effective alternative where two spattally separated uni-polarized antennas are replaced by a single antenna structure employing orthogonal polarizations. This paper in- vestigates the performance of spatial multiplexing and transmit diversity (Alamouti scheme) in <b>MIMe</b> wireless <b>systems</b> employing dual-polarized antennas. In particular, we derive estimates for the uncoded average symbol error rate of spatial multiplexing and transmit diversity and identify channel conditions where the use of polarization diversity yields performance improvements. We show that while improve- ments in terms of symbol error rate of up to {{an order of magnitude}} are possible in the case of spatial multiplexing, the presence of polarization diversity generally incurs a performance loss for transmit diver- sity techniques. Finally, we provide simulation results to demonstrate that our estimates closely match the actual symbol error rates...|$|R

Some of these encodings are uuencoding, Ascii85, SREC, BinHex, kermit and <b>MIME's</b> Base64. EBCDIC-based <b>systems</b> cannot handle all characters used in UUencoded data. However, the base64 encoding does not have this problem.|$|R
40|$|We present cluster-DMFT (CTQMC) {{calculations}} {{based on}} a downfolded tight-binding model in order to study the electronic structure of vanadium dioxide (VO_ 2) both in the low-temperature (M_ 1) and high-temperature (rutile) phases. Motivated by the recent efforts directed towards tuning the physical properties of VO_ 2 by depositing films on different supporting surfaces of different orientations we performed calculations for different geometries for both phases. In order to investigate {{the effects of the}} different growing geometries we applied both contraction and expansion for the lattice parameter along the rutile c-axis in the 3 -dimensional translationally invariant <b>systems</b> <b>miming</b> the real situation. Our main focus is to identify the mechanisms governing the formation of the gap characterizing the M_ 1 phase and its dependence on strain.

40|$|Saliva {{has a role}} in the {{appreciation}} and acceptance of food and beverages. During eating and drinking, all kinds of oral sensations (taste, viscosity, astringency) are modulated by saliva. Also the retro-nasal olfactory perception is significantly affected by the interaction with saliva mostly as a consequence of its proteins content. We previously found that salivary transglutaminase (TG) could be involved in the alteration of the retro-nasal aroma volatilization in obese individuals likely modifying the sensory perception (1). The relationship between TG and volatile release was investigated in vitro in a model <b>system</b> <b>miming</b> differences in TG levels detected in human saliva from obese (O) and normal weight (N) people. A lower inter-individual variability and a significant high mean value of TG was detected in saliva samples from O with respect to N subjects, showing a recurrent alteration of salivary TG correlated to the weight status. TG interaction with three volatiles – ethyl acetate, benzaldehyde and 2 -phenylethanol, were analysed in an artificial saliva solution by DH/SPMEGC/ MS. They were chosen because their release significantly (P< 0. 001 to P< 0. 05) diminished (49...|$|R

Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet Official Protocol Standards " (STD 1) for the standardization state and status of this protocol. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. STD 11, RFC 822, defines a message representation protocol specifying considerable detail about US-ASCII message headers, and leaves the message content, or message body, as flat US-ASCII text. This set of documents, collectively called the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, or MIME, redefines the format of messages to allow for (1) textual message bodies in character sets other than US-ASCII, (2) an extensible set of different formats for non-textual message bodies, (3) multi-part message bodies, and (4) textual header information in character sets other than US-ASCII. These documents are based on earlier work documented in RFC 934, STD 11, and RFC 1049, but extends and revises them. Because RFC 822 said so little about message bodies, these documents are largely orthogonal to (rather than a revision of) RFC 822. The initial document in this set, RFC 2045, specifies the various headers {{used to describe the}} structure of MIME messages. The second document defines the general structure of the <b>MIME</b> media typing <b>system</b> and defines an initial set of media types.

40|$|Mobile {{devices have}} evolved into {{powerful}} computing platforms. As computing capabilities grow and size shrinks, the most pronounced limitation with mobile devices is display size. With {{the adoption of}} touch as the de facto input, the mobile screen doubles as a display and an input device. Touchscreen interfaces have several limitations: the act of touching the screen occludes the display, interface elements like on-screen keyboards consume precious display real estate, and navigation through content often requires repeated actions like pinch-and-zoom. This thesis is motivated by these inherent limitations of using touch input to interact with mobile devices. Thus, {{the primary focus of}} this thesis is on using the space around the device for touchless gestural input to devices with small or no displays. Capturing gestural input in this volume requires localization of the human hand in 3 D. We present a real-time system for doing so as a culmination of an exploration of novel methods for 3 D capture. First, two related systems for 3 D imaging are presented, both relying on modeling and algorithms from parametric sampling theory and compressed sensing. Then, a separate system for 3 D localization, without full 3 D imaging, is presented. This <b>system,</b> <b>Mime,</b> is built using standard, low-cost opto-electronic components - a single LED and three baseline separated photodiodes. We demonstrate fast and accurate 3 D motion tracking at low power enabled by parametric scene response modeling. We combine this low-power 3 D tracking with RGB image-based computer vision algorithms for finer gestural control. We demonstrate a variety of application scenarios developed using our sensor, including 3 D spatial input using close-range gestures, gaming, on-the-move interaction, and operation in cluttered environments and in broad daylight conditions. by Andrea B.

40|$|Nanomedicine {{is a new}} {{branch of}} medicine, based on the {{potentiality}} and intrinsic properties of nanomaterials. Indeed, the nanomaterials (i. e. the materials with nano and under micron size) can be suitable to different applications in biomedicine. The nanostructures {{can be used by}} taking advantage of their properties (for example superparamagnetic nanoparticles) or functionalized to deliver the drug in a specific target, thanks the ability to cross biological barriers. The size and the shape of 1 D-nanostructures (nanotubes and nanowires) have an important role on the cell fate: their morphology plays a key role on the interaction between nanostructure and the biological system. For this reason the 1 D nanostructure are interesting for their ability to <b>mime</b> the biological <b>system.</b> An implantable material or device must therefore integrate with the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), a complex network of proteins with structural and signaling properties. Innovative techniques allow the generation of complex surface patterns that can resemble the structure of the ECM, such as 1 D nanostructures. NWs based on cubic silicon carbide (3 C-SiC), either bare (3 C-SiC NWs) or surrounded by an amorphous shell (3 C-SiC/SiO 2 core/shell NWs), and silicon oxycarbide nanowires (SiOxCy NWs) can meet the chemical, mechanical and electrical requirements for tissue engineering and have a strong potential {{to pave the way for}} the development of a novel generation of implantable nano-devices. Silicon oxycarbide shows promising physical and chemical properties as elastic modulus, bending strength and hardness, chemical durability superior to conventional silicate glasses in aggressive environments and high temperature stability up to 1300 °C. Moreover, it can easily be engineered through functionalization and decoration with macro-molecules and nanoparticles. Silicon carbide has been extensively studied for applications in harsh conditions, as chemical environment, high electric field and high and low temperature, owing to its high hardness, high thermal conductivity, chemical inertness and high electron mobility. Also, its cubic polytype (3 C) is highly biocompatible and hemocompatible, and some prototypes of biomedical applications and biomedical devices have been already realized starting from 3 C-SiC thin films. Cubic SiC-based NWs can be used as a biomimetic biomaterial, providing a robust and novel biocompatible biological interface. We cultured in vitro A 549 human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells and L 929 murine fibroblast cells over core/shell SiC/SiO 2, SiOxCy and bare 3 C-SiC nanowire platforms, and analysed the cytotoxicity, by indirect and direct contact tests, the cell adhesion, and the cell proliferation. These studies showed that all the nanowires are biocompatible according to ISO 10993 standards. We evaluated the blood compatibility through the interaction of the nanowires with platelet rich plasma. The adhesion and activation of platelets on the nanowire bundles, assessed via SEM imaging and soluble P-selectin quantification, indicated that a higher platelet activation is induced by the core/shell structures compared to the bare ones. Further, platelet activation is higher with 3 C-SiC/SiO 2 NWs and SiOxCyNWs, which therefore appear suitable in view of possible tissue regeneration. On the contrary, bare 3 C-SiC NWs show a lower platelet activation and are therefore promising in view of implantable bioelectronics devices, as cardiovascular implantable devices. The NWs properties are suitable to allow the design of a novel subretinal Micro Device (MD). This devices is based on Si NWs and PEDOT:PSS, though the well know principle of the hybrid ordered bulk heterojunction (OBHJ). The aim is to develop a device based on a well-established photovoltaic technology and to adapt this know-how to the prosthetic field. The hybrid OBHJ allows to form a radial p–n junction on a nanowire/organic structure. In addition, the nanowires increase the light absorption by means of light scattering effects: a nanowires based p-n junction increases the light absorption up to the 80 %, as previously demonstrated, overcoming the Shockley-Queisser limit of 30 % of a bulk p-n junction. Another interesting employment of these NWs is to design of a SiC based epicardial-interacting patch based on teflon that include SiC nanowires.. Such contact patch can bridge the electric conduction across the cardiac infarct as nanowires can ‘sense’ the direction of the wavefront propagation on the survival cardiac tissue and transmit it to the downstream surivived regions without discontinuity. The SiC NWs are tested in terms of toxicology, biocompatibility and conductance among cardiomyocytes and myofibroblasts...|$|R
