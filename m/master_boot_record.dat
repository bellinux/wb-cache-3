5|$|Some {{payloads}} consist simply of {{an application}} designed to lock or restrict the system until payment is made, typically by setting the Windows Shell to itself, or even modifying the <b>master</b> <b>boot</b> <b>record</b> and/or partition table {{to prevent the}} operating system from booting until it is repaired. The most sophisticated payloads encrypt files, with many using strong encryption to encrypt the victim's files {{in such a way}} that only the malware author has the needed decryption key.|$|E
5|$|Petya {{was first}} {{discovered}} in March 2016; unlike {{other forms of}} encrypting ransomware, the malware aimed to infect the <b>master</b> <b>boot</b> <b>record,</b> installing a payload which encrypts the file tables of the NTFS file system the next time that the infected system boots, blocking the system from booting into Windows at all until the ransom is paid. Check Point reported that despite what it believed to be an innovative evolution in ransomware design, it had resulted in relatively-fewer infections than other ransomware active {{around the same time}} frame.|$|E
25|$|Sectors are 512 bytes long, for {{compatibility}} with hard disk drives, {{and the first}} sector can contain a <b>master</b> <b>boot</b> <b>record</b> and a partition table. Therefore, USB flash units can be partitioned just like hard disk drives.|$|E

25|$|GUID Partition Table (GPT) is a {{standard}} for {{the layout of the}} partition table on a physical hard disk. It {{is a part of the}} Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) standard proposed by Intel as a substitute for the earlier PC BIOS. The GPT replaces the <b>Master</b> <b>Boot</b> <b>Record</b> (MBR) used with BIOS.|$|E
25|$|On non-partitioned devices, such as floppy disks, the Boot Sector (VBR) is {{the first}} sector (logical sector 0 with {{physical}} CHS address 0/0/1 or LBA address 0). For partitioned devices such as hard drives, the first sector is the <b>Master</b> <b>Boot</b> <b>Record</b> defining partitions, while the first sector of partitions formatted with a FAT file system is again the Boot Sector.|$|E
25|$|Examples of {{partition}} mapping scheme include <b>Master</b> <b>boot</b> <b>record</b> (MBR) and GUID Partition Table (GPT). Examples of data structures {{stored on}} disk to retrieve files include the File Allocation Table (FAT) in the DOS file system and inodes in many UNIX file systems, {{as well as}} other operating system data structures (also known as metadata). As a consequence, not all the space on an HDD is available for user files, but this system overhead is usually small compared with user data.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the bootstrap code and a partition table, <b>master</b> <b>boot</b> <b>records</b> may contain a disk signature. This is a 32-bit value that is intended to identify uniquely the disk medium (as opposed to the disk unitâ€”the two not necessarily being the same for removable hard disks).|$|R
5000|$|On 20 March 2013, in {{an attack}} {{launched}} against South Korea, a logic bomb struck machines and [...] "wiped the hard drives and <b>master</b> <b>boot</b> <b>records</b> {{of at least three}} banks and two media companies simultaneously." [...] Symantec reported that the malware also contained a component that was capable of wiping Linux machines.|$|R
5000|$|A {{computer}} {{infected with}} the original version had a one in eight probability that the screen would declare: [...] "Your PC is now Stoned!", a phrase found in infected boot sectors of infected floppy disks and <b>master</b> <b>boot</b> <b>records</b> of infected hard disks, along with the phrase [...] "Legalise Marijuana". Later variants produced a range of other messages.|$|R
25|$|When a PC {{is powered}} on its BIOS follows the {{configured}} boot {{order to find}} a bootable device. This can be a harddisk, floppy, CD/DVD, network connection, USB-device, etc. depending on the BIOS. In {{the case of a}} floppy the BIOS interprets its boot sector (first sector) as code, for NTLDR this could be a NTLDR boot sector looking for the ntldr file on the floppy. For a harddisk the code in the <b>Master</b> <b>Boot</b> <b>Record</b> (first sector) determines the active partition. The code in the boot sector of the active partition could then be again a NTLDR boot sector looking for ntldr in the root directory of this active partition. In a more convoluted scenario the active partition can contain a Vista boot sector for the newer Vista boot manager with an {ntldr} entry pointing to another partition with a NTLDR boot sector.|$|E
2500|$|A kernel-mode rootkit variant {{called a}} bootkit, it can infect startup code like the <b>Master</b> <b>Boot</b> <b>Record</b> (MBR), Volume Boot Record (VBR) or boot sector, {{and in this}} way, {{can be used to}} attack full disk {{encryption}} systems.|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} such an attack on disk {{encryption}} is the [...] "Evil Maid Attack", in which an attacker installs a bootkit on an unattended computer, replacing the legitimate boot loader with one under their control. Typically the malware loader persists through the transition to protected mode when the kernel has loaded, and is thus able to subvert the kernel. For example, the [...] "Stoned Bootkit" [...] subverts the system by using a compromised boot loader to intercept encryption keys and passwords. More recently, the Alureon rootkit has successfully subverted the requirement for 64-bit kernel-mode driver signing in Windows 7 by modifying the <b>master</b> <b>boot</b> <b>record.</b> Although not malware {{in the sense of}} doing something the user doesn't want, certain [...] "Vista Loader" [...] or [...] "Windows Loader" [...] software works in a similar way by injecting an ACPI SLIC (System Licensed Internal Code) table in the RAM-cached version of the BIOS during boot, in order to defeat the Windows Vista and Windows 7 activation process. This vector of attack was rendered useless in the (non-server) versions of Windows 8, which use a unique, machine-specific key for each system, that can only be used by that one machine. Many antivirus companies provide free utilities and programs to remove bootkits.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to criminal money-making, malware {{can be used}} for sabotage, often for political motives.Stuxnet, for example, was designed to disrupt very specific industrial equipment. There have been politically motivated attacks that have spread over and shut down large computer networks, including massive deletion of files and corruption of <b>master</b> <b>boot</b> <b>records,</b> described as [...] "computer killing". Such attacks were made on Sony Pictures Entertainment (25 November 2014, using malware known as Shamoon or W32.Disttrack) and Saudi Aramco (August 2012).|$|R
50|$|Crazy Boot is a {{computer}} virus that infects the Microsoft Windows operating systems causing no physical damage nor direct loss of information; it would {{be known as a}} hoax to some. If the host computer is booted from an infected floppy disk, this virus makes it look as though all physical hard drives have been lost. Crazy Boot spreads through unprotected disks easily. It spreads only on diskettes, not by file distribution. The virus resides in memory, it infects the <b>master</b> <b>boot</b> <b>records</b> of all physical hard disks and infects the boot sectors of floppy disks. If Crazy Boot is in memory, any access to the <b>boot</b> <b>record</b> is rerouted to a copy of the original boot sector. When the virus infects a hard drive, it makes a copy of the partition table (an important part of the system area), writes the copy, and deletes the original partition table. To read the partition information, Crazy Boot must be active in memory. If users boot from a floppy disk not infected by this virus in order to avoid it, all physical hard drives are inaccessible by normal means.|$|R
