40|$|This article {{extends the}} {{analysis}} of <b>table</b> <b>mixes</b> for restaurants, {{on the principle that}} <b>table</b> <b>mix</b> helps drive revenue. The article presents the results of a simulation experiment of more than forty-six thousand restaurant contexts to evaluate the accuracy of “naïve <b>table</b> <b>mix</b> ” calculations. An earlier study presented a simple method of calculating a recommended <b>mix</b> of <b>tables</b> in a restaurant, and another found that those calculations provided <b>table</b> <b>mixes</b> yielding within about 1 percent of the revenue provided by the optimal <b>table</b> <b>mix.</b> While the earlier simulation studies assumed that the space required by a table was directly proportional to the number of seats it contained, that is not always the case. Thus, this article presents space-oriented versions of the existing naïve <b>table</b> <b>mix</b> methods. The article also presents the results of a test of two other forms of the naïve <b>table</b> <b>mix</b> calculations, which include party revenue (or contribution). The simplest of the naïve <b>table</b> <b>mix</b> models proved to be the best, on balance. It yielded <b>table</b> <b>mixes</b> that generated more than 98 percent of the revenue achievable by near-optimal <b>table</b> <b>mixes.</b> As a caveat, however, in more than 5 percent of the simulated scenarios, the best naïve <b>table</b> <b>mix</b> model yielded less than 95 percent of the revenue achievable by a near-optimal <b>table</b> <b>mix.</b> These findings suggest that the naïve <b>table</b> <b>mix</b> calculations be used with caution.

5000|$|New {{points of}} view offers Ortiz Morales, in his thesis [...] El ballet mécanique y el Synchro-ciné , already in 2008. He refutes all the {{points of view}} that have given origin to the {{realization}} of Lehrman and proposes other alternatives within {{what he calls the}} state of confusion around the film. Among others, the score of 30 minutes and 16 synchronized pianolas so laboriously obtained is not really the original musical idea for the film, but a subsequent expansion of the original idea, which was carried out by Antheil as a [...] spectacular [...] and independent concert, once proved that it could not synchronize its music together with the images of Léger. The true film score must have been much simpler and more precise, and possibly the one that would end up orchestrating in 1953. It argues, therefore, that the problem of original synchronization was never in the 16 synchronized pianolas of the giant score, but the problem with the simple version (for the film) must have been in the device that had to synchronize it mechanically : the Synchro-Ciné of the inventor Charles Delacommune, possibly the first audio-visual <b>mixing</b> <b>table</b> of the story and with which it is known that they were desperately trying for a while (there is documented) the material for that film, signed by Léger and Delacommune). According to technical studies on documentation (the apparatus as such was lost in II World War [...] ) , it seems that the synchro-ciné was a [...] synchronizer [...] capable of good audio-video simultaneities in standard measures, but the fleeting and devilish rhythm of the work far exceeded its possibilities: especially the amalgamated ones, of 7 and 5, very used in the work and impossible to obtain with a such precarious device. With a more restrained and square music, they could have been tuned and synchronized mechanically, which was what Léger promised to the press after talking to Delacommune (but before having tried it in practice with the music of Antheil).|$|E

The results of studies of the influence of food containing a large amount of iron in presumably easily utilizable form, as in raw beef spleen, do not support the view that the anemia is due to lack of iron in the food.

Indeed, new collaborative applications emerged from theses new supports using classical interaction (through keyboard, mouse and screen devices).

This article is indented to propose a global interaction model that associates multiagent system concepts to interactive table entities. The model proposes two types of entities {{that can be used}} simultaneously: virtual and tangible entities. The virtual entities can result from video projection or from screen use on the interactive table. The tangible entities are physical objects that can be manipulated by one or several users. These are detected through dedicated sensors. At the end of this article, a case study is presented. It illustrates the management of a road traffic simulator using the TangiSense interactive table. The illustrations show mainly the communication between the different agents. In addition, the simulator presents the advantages of the proposed model in order to facilitate the implied users’ decision during the simulation process...|$|R
