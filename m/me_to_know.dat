500|$|He {{once said}} that [...] "in choreography, {{ordinary}} movements from real life are taken and extended, so they become dance movements, yet the relation to reality must always be there. It's important for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> who the characters are and what their function is in the script. I {{must be able to}} illustrate either their activities, their emotions, or their changes in mood by the way they dance, all the while keeping the dance movements footed in reality and yet making the movements sort of odd and eccentric." [...] This philosophy was reflected in the early scene from The Band Wagon, when Fred Astaire walks down a railroad platform singing [...] "By Myself." [...] His walk was not quite a dance, and epitomized Kidd's style.|$|E
500|$|Webber's orchestral accompaniment added a {{different}} level to the track, with its composition consisting of pizzicato strings, and its flowing tempo introducing Covington's opening vocals. The song jumps from being light to heavy and extravagant, with one section of it being hummed by choral voices. As the final lyrics goes, [...] "But {{all you have to}} do is look at <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> / That every word is true" [...] is sung, the London Philharmonic Orchestra comes into play with a huge climax and ends. According to the sheet music published by Music Sales Group, the song starts with a sequence of G/D–A7/D–D–Bm/D, changes to E–E/D–A/C–E7–A–D, with the chorus featuring a chord progression of A–Bm–Dmaj7–Gmaj7–G–Fm7. The song is composed in the key of C major with Covington's vocals spanning from the nodes of E3 to G5.|$|E

Topping continued to visit Hindley in prison, along with her solicitor Michael Fisher and her spiritual counsellor, the Reverend Peter Timms, {{who had been a}} prison governor before resigning to become a minister in the Methodist Church. She made a formal confession to police on 10 February 1987, admitting her involvement in all five murders, but news of her confession was not made public for more than a month. The tape recording of her statement was over 17hours long; Topping described it as a [...] "very well worked out performance in which, I believe, she told me just as much as she wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> and no more". He also commented that he [...] "was {{struck by the fact that}} she was never there when the killings took place. She was in the car, over the brow of the hill, in the bathroom and even, in the case of the Evans murder, in the kitchen". Topping concluded that he felt he [...] "had witnessed a great performance rather than a genuine confession".|$|E

God requires one to obey the revealed moral law saying: [...] "love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbour as yourself".

2500|$|In October 1941, Hellman and Ernest Hemingway co-hosted {{a dinner}} {{to raise money}} for anti-Nazi activists imprisoned in France.

It was not my intention that it go as far as it did. I apologize to anyone offended – including the audience, MTV, CBS and the NFL." [...] Due to the event being accidental and unintentional, Jackson refused to release another apology statement to media outlets following this. Speaking to USA Today, Jackson said, [...] "It's truly embarrassing for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that 90 million [...] people saw my breast, and then to see it blown up on the Internet the size of a computer screen ... but there are much worse things in the world, and for this to be such a focus, I don't understand."
