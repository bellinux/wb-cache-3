The trend of the development degree of logistics industry and its correlation degree with relative industries can be seen.

However, {{it is difficult to}} characterize their mechanical properties because those strongly depend on environmental and mechanical conditions such as temperature, humidity or strain rate. In this paper, we focus on the strain rate dependence of the interfacial strength and investigate the interfacial strength by peel tests under several peel rates. The results show that, in low rate case (under 10 - 2 mm/s), the interfacial strength was constant and, in <b>middle</b> <b>rate</b> case (10 - 2 to 103 mm/s), the interfacial strength increased with the peel rate. Over 103 mm/s case, the interfacial strength became lower than those in <b>middle</b> <b>rate</b> cases.

40|$|Purpose: Whether this {{earthquake}} {{would become}} a turning point of the high oil price and whether it would have big impact on yen exchange rate are two issues to be discussed in this paper. Design/methodology/approach: To analyze deeply the internal relations between changes in yen exchange rate caused by Japan’s earthquake and price fluctuation of international crude oil, this research chooses <b>middle</b> <b>rate</b> of yen exchange rate during the 45 days around Japan’s earthquake and price data of international crude oil to do an empirical study, uses VAR model and HP trend decomposition to estimate the mutual effect of yen exchange rate change and price fluctuation of international crude oil in this period. Findings: It {{has been found in}} the empirical study with VAR model and HP filter decomposition model on the yen exchange rate and the international crude oil price fluctuation during 45 days around Japan’s earthquake that: the fluctuation of yen exchange rate around the earthquake {{is one of the main}} reasons for the drastic fluctuation of international crude oil price in that period. The fluctuation of international crude oil price directly triggered by yen exchange rate occupies 13. 54 % of its total variance. There is a long-term interactive relationship between yen exchange rate and international crude oil price. The upward trend of international crude oil price after the earthquake was obvious, while yen exchange rate remained relatively stable after the earthquake. Originality/value: As economic globalization goes deeper, the influence of natural disasters on international financial market and world economy will become more and more obvious. It has a great revelatory meaning to studying further each kind of natural disaster’s impacts on international financial market and world economic...|$|E

Indonesia as emerging markets that quite susceptible to the global economy’s conditions. To determine the condition of a country's financial markets is through the capital market {{that can be seen}} from the Composite Stock Price Index (CSPI). Factors that affect the movement of a country's stock index are changing of central bank interest rates, the stock price index of regional countries, the global economy situation, the energy prices level, currency exchange rates, politics stability of a country (Blanchard, 2006). The purpose of this study is analysing the effect of the exchange rate of USD / IDR, the World Gold Price, the World Oil Price, the DJIA index, the Nikkei Index and the Foreign Net Purchases to the Composite Stock Price Index (IHSG) in Indonesia Stock Market (BEI) in 2003 to 2013 by using ARCH-GARCH models.

This condition indicates that increasing of those four variables value will raise IHSG value, on the other hand decreasing of those variables value will weaken IHSG value.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{leaching}} losses from pasture-based systems occurs predominantly from urine deposited by grazing animals, but also following fertiliser application. However, there is limited understanding of the interaction and fate of urinary N and fertiliser N. The objective {{of this study was to}} use APSIM modelling software to generate pre-experimental data to aid with the design of a lysimeter experiment that will endeavour to study the interactions of fertiliser urinary N on N leaching and N₂O emissions. APSIM simulations were run to explore the likely fate of several combinations of urine and fertiliser N under experimental conditions normally imposed on lysimeters, using the weather records for Hamilton from 1972 to 2009. The soil type used was a Horotiu silt loam with a urine-N rate of 800 kg/ha and fertiliser rates of 0 to 500 kg N/ha per year. The modelled data suggested two hypotheses, including that:  NO₃-N leaching from autumn-deposited urine will be greater than from spring-deposited urine at the same urinary fertiliser N application rates.  There will be a greater N fertiliser effect on NO₃-N leaching from under spring-deposited urine than under autumn-deposited urine. Based upon prior knowledge and examination of data from the pre-experimental modelling, we were able to determine that the most appropriate fertiliser rates for the lysimeter experiment should include a control rate of 0 kg N/ha per year; a <b>middle</b> <b>rate</b> of 200 kg N/ha per year and an upper rate of 400 kg N/ha per year. Due to the cost and time limitations of a lysimeter experiment, a one year investigative period has been proposed. Analysis of the modelled data using climate inputs for each year from 1972 to 2009, concluded that the likelihood of this single year design producing anomalous results is low. The modelled data also indicated that leaching from the lysimeters should continue to be monitored for 18 to 20 months in order to capture leachate associated with both the autumn and spring-applied urine. The information from the modelled data has been used in the final design of the experiment. The lysimeter experiment was commenced in February 2011, and will test the above-mentioned hypotheses...|$|E
