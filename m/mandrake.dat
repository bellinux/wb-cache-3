5|$|In December 1928 Crowley met the Nicaraguan Maria Teresa Sanchez. Crowley was {{deported}} from France by the authorities, who disliked {{his reputation}} and feared {{that he was}} a German agent. So that she could join him in Britain, Crowley married Sanchez in August 1929. Now based in London, <b>Mandrake</b> Press agreed to publish his autobiography in a limited edition six-volume set, also publishing his novel Moonchild and book of short stories The Stratagem. <b>Mandrake</b> went into liquidation in November 1930, before the entirety of Crowley's Confessions could be published. Mandrake's owner P.R. Stephenson meanwhile wrote The Legend of Aleister Crowley, an analysis of the media coverage surrounding him.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Simeon {{taught that}} because Rachel treated the righteous Jacob so slightingly (as to trade away {{sleeping}} {{with him for}} some <b>mandrakes,</b> as reported in [...] ) she was not buried with him. Thus in [...] Rachel said (in unwitting prophecy) [...] "Therefore, he [...] shall lie with you ," [...] hinting that Jacob would lie with Leah in death, and not with Rachel. Rabbi Berekiah taught that Rabbi Eleazar and Rabbi Samuel ben Nahman commented on this. Rabbi Eleazar said that each wife lost (by the transaction) and each gained. Leah lost the <b>mandrakes</b> and gained the tribes (of Issachar and Zebulun) while Rachel gained the <b>mandrakes</b> and lost the tribes (of Issachar and Zebulun). (And some say, Leah lost the birthright and Rachel gained the birthright. The birthright belonged to Reuben, but as a punishment for Reuben's causing this transaction, the birthright was taken from him and given to Joseph.) Rabbi Samuel ben Nahman said that Leah lost <b>mandrakes</b> and gained (two) tribes and the privilege of burial with Jacob, while Rachel gained <b>mandrakes</b> and lost the tribes and burial with Jacob.|$|R

5|$|Drug {{collectors}} {{have certain}} traditions {{which may be}} accurate or may be exaggerated. Precautions are rightly taken when gathering hellebore, and men cannot dig it up for long; whereas the story that the peony must be dug up at night for fear that a woodpecker will watch and cause the man a rectal prolapse is a mere superstition. Similarly {{the idea that you}} must mark three circles around a <b>mandrake</b> plant with a sword, and speak of the mysteries of love while cutting it, is just far-fetched.|$|E
5|$|Throughout history mandrakes (Mandragora officinarum) {{have been}} highly sought after for their reputed aphrodisiac properties. However, {{the roots of}} the <b>mandrake</b> plant also contain large {{quantities}} of the alkaloid scopolamine, which, at high doses, acts as a central nervous system depressant, and makes the plant highly toxic to herbivores. Scopolamine was later found to be medicinally used for pain management prior to and during labor; in smaller doses it is used to prevent motion sickness. One of the most well-known medicinally valuable terpenes is an anticancer drug, taxol, isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia, in the early 1960s.|$|E

God heeded Leah and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son, and called him Issachar, saying that God had given her a reward. Leah bore Jacob a sixth son and called him Zebulun, saying that God had endowed her with a good dowry. And afterwards Leah bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah. God heeded Rachel and she conceived and bore a son and called him Joseph, invoking God to add another son. Then Jacob asked Laban to allow him, his wives, and his children to return to his own country. Laban conceded that God had blessed him for Jacob's sake.

25|$|Superman {{has come}} to be seen as an American {{cultural}} icon. Superman is often thought of as the first superhero. This point is debated by historians: Doctor Occult, an earlier creation of Siegel and Shuster, appeared in comic books two years earlier, and the Phantom and <b>Mandrake</b> the Magician had previously appeared in newspaper strips. However, there is no debate that Superman started the 20th century's craze for costumed adventurers.|$|E

The use of preparations similar to opium in surgery is recorded in the Ebers Papyrus, an Egyptian medical papyrus written in the Eighteenth dynasty. However, it is questionable whether opium itself was known in ancient Egypt. The Greek gods Hypnos (Sleep), Nyx (Night), and Thanatos (Death) were often depicted holding poppies.|$|E
