5|$|Reagan spoke {{frequently}} at rallies with {{a strong}} ideological dimension; in December 1945, he was stopped from leading an anti-nuclear rally in Hollywood by pressure from the Warner Bros. studio. He would later make nuclear weapons a key point of his presidency, specifically his opposition to <b>mutual</b> <b>assured</b> <b>destruction,</b> and he built on previous efforts to limit {{the spread of nuclear}} weapons. In the 1948 presidential election, Reagan strongly supported Harry S. Truman, appearing on stage with him during a campaign speech in Los Angeles. However, in the early 1950s, as his relationship with actress Nancy Davis grew, he shifted to the right and endorsed the presidential candidacies of Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956 as well as Richard Nixon in 1960.|$|E

25|$|May 1962: The Cuban Missile Crisis was a 13-day {{confrontation}} in October 1962 between the Soviet Union and Cuba {{on one side}} and the United States on the other side. The crisis is generally regarded as the moment in which the Cold War came closest to turning into a nuclear conflict and is also the first documented instance of <b>mutual</b> <b>assured</b> <b>destruction</b> (MAD) being discussed as a determining factor in a major international arms agreement.|$|E
5000|$|Soviet nuclear doctrine, however, did {{not match}} American nuclear doctrine. Soviet {{military}} planners assumed they could win a nuclear war. Therefore, they expected a large-scale nuclear exchange, followed by a [...] "conventional war" [...] which itself would involve heavy use of tactical nuclear weapons. American doctrine rather assumed that Soviet doctrine was similar, with the <b>mutual</b> in Mutually <b>Assured</b> <b>Destruction</b> necessarily requiring {{that the other side}} see things in much the same way, rather than believing—as the Soviets did—that they could fight a large-scale, [...] "combined nuclear and conventional" [...] war.|$|R
50|$|The MAD {{doctrine}} {{assumes that}} each side has enough nuclear weaponry {{to destroy the}} other side and that either side, if attacked for any reason by the other, would retaliate without fail with equal or greater force. The expected result is an immediate, irreversible escalation of hostilities resulting in both combatants' <b>mutual,</b> total, and <b>assured</b> <b>destruction.</b> The doctrine requires that neither side construct shelters on a massive scale. If one side constructed a similar system of shelters, it would violate the MAD doctrine and destabilize the situation, because it would not have to fear the consequences of a second strike. The same principle is invoked against missile defense.|$|R
50|$|In {{military}} strategy, <b>assured</b> <b>destruction</b> {{is where}} behaviors or choices are deterred {{because they will}} lead to overwhelming punitive consequences. It was most often discussed as mutually <b>assured</b> <b>destruction</b> (MAD), assuming there are exactly two parties in the conflict. The concept of <b>assured</b> <b>destruction</b> occasionally arises also in the death penalty debate and biotechnology debate.|$|R
25|$|While {{teaching}} {{for a few}} weeks in Zurich, Dyson was visited by two officials from the Swiss civil defense authority. Their experts were telling them that fairly simple shelters on a large scale would enable them to survive a nuclear attack, and they wanted confirmation. They knew that Dyson had a security clearance. Dyson reassured them that their shelters would do the job. The US does not build such shelters because it would be contrary to the doctrine of <b>mutual</b> <b>assured</b> <b>destruction,</b> since the US would be able to launch a first strike but survive retaliation.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the KC-97 and Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers was pushed by the Cold War requirement of the United States {{to be able to}} keep fleets of nuclear-armed B-47 Stratojet and B-52 Stratofortress strategic bombers airborne around-the-clock either to threaten retaliation against a Soviet strike for <b>mutual</b> <b>assured</b> <b>destruction,</b> or to bomb the U.S.S.R. first had it been ordered to do so by the President of the United States. The bombers would fly orbits around their assigned positions from which they were to enter Soviet airspace if they received the order, and the tankers would refill the bombers' fuel tanks so that they could keep a force in the air 24 hours a day, and still have enough fuel to reach their targets in the Soviet Union. This also ensured that a first strike against the bombers' airfields could not obliterate the U.S.'s ability to retaliate by bomber.|$|E
25|$|The LoADS {{concept was}} {{one of a number of}} {{proposals}} that were made as part of a larger and acrimonious debate over the best way to base the MX missile. It was believed that by about 1980 Soviet ICBMs would improve to the point where it was possible to attack US ICBMs while they were still in their silos. A number of warfighting scenarios suggested that a surprise attack would significantly reduce the US stockpile and greatly blunt any counterattack. In the case of the MX, a single successful strike on a silo would mean ten warheads would not reach the USSR, making these extremely valuable targets. To ensure such an attack would fail, at least to the point where the <b>Mutual</b> <b>Assured</b> <b>Destruction</b> (MAD) would be maintained, a wide variety of basing options were considered that would guarantee the survival of at least dozens of MX's.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the concept}} of <b>assured</b> <b>destruction</b> is applied in the {{doctrine}} of law, it is often criticized by proponents of the restorative justice and transformative justice approaches, who point out that <b>assured</b> <b>destruction</b> doctrines are rarely implemented with rigor or integrity of due process. This contributes to the controversy {{of the death penalty}} debate.|$|R

25|$|The U.S. has 18 Ohio-class submarines, {{of which}} 14 are Trident II SSBNs (Ship, Submersible, Ballistic, Nuclear), each capable of {{carrying}} 24 SLBMs. The first four which were all equipped with the older Trident I missiles have been converted to SSGN's each {{capable of carrying}} 154 Tomahawk guided missiles and have been further equipped to support Special Operations (SEALS). If the maximum of 154 Tomahawk missiles were loaded, one Ohio-class SSGN would carry an entire Battle Group's equivalent of cruise missiles. Ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs or boomers in American slang) carry submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) with nuclear warheads for attacking strategic targets such as cities or missile silos anywhere in the world. They are currently universally nuclear-powered to provide the greatest stealth and endurance. They played {{an important part in}} Cold War mutual deterrence, as both the United States and the Soviet Union had the credible ability to conduct a retaliatory strike against the other nation {{in the event of a}} first strike. This comprised an important part of the strategy of <b>Mutual</b> <b>Assured</b> <b>Destruction.</b>|$|E
25|$|SDI {{was criticized}} for {{potentially}} disrupting the strategic doctrine of <b>mutual</b> <b>assured</b> <b>destruction.</b> MAD postulated that intentional nuclear attack was inhibited by the certainty of ensuing mutual destruction. Even if a nuclear first strike destroyed many of the opponent's weapons, sufficient nuclear missiles would survive to render a devastating counter-strike against the attacker. The criticism was that SDI could have potentially allowed an attacker to survive the lighter counter-strike, thus encouraging a first strike by the side having SDI. Another destabilizing scenario was countries being tempted to strike first before SDI was deployed, thereby avoiding a disadvantaged nuclear posture. Proponents of SDI argued that SDI development might instead cause the side {{that did not have}} the resources to develop SDI to, rather than launching a suicidal nuclear first strike attack before the SDI system was deployed, instead come to the bargaining table with the country that did have those resources and, hopefully, agree to a real, sincere disarmament pact that would drastically decrease all forces, both nuclear and conventional. Furthermore, the MAD argument was criticized on the grounds that MAD only covered intentional, full-scale nuclear attacks by a rational, non-suicidal opponent with similar values. It did not take into account limited launches, accidental launches, rogue launches, or launches by non-state entities or covert proxies.|$|E
25|$|Hudson and Weaver are {{revealed}} to be Mason's interrogators.

As a result, the U.S. is preparing a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the Soviet Union, which {{would result in the}} inevitable <b>Mutual</b> <b>Assured</b> <b>Destruction</b> of World War III. Hudson needed Steiner to abort the gas launch, but after his death, only Mason has any knowledge of the numbers station. Hudson reveals that Dragovich brainwashed Mason to understand the numbers broadcasts and assassinate Kennedy, effectively making him a Soviet sleeper agent. The real Reznov never escaped, but died during the Vorkuta breakout attempt, and the Soviet defector in Hue was actually killed before Mason reached him. Mason’s visions of Reznov are a result of a dissociative disorder caused by the traumatic brainwashing program. Prior to the Vorkuta uprising, Reznov reprogrammed Mason to assassinate Dragovich, Kravchenko, and Steiner instead. Mason finally remembers the location of the broadcast station: a Russian cargo ship called Rusalka off the coast of Cuba. An assault on the Rusalka begins, with Mason and Hudson infiltrating the underwater submarine base protecting the ship. Hudson calls in the United States Navy to destroy the Rusalka. Mason and Hudson finally confront Dragovich in the lower levels of the facility, and Mason strangles and drowns him to death before escaping with Hudson. They regroup with Weaver, who declares victory.|$|E

2500|$|Reagan was a vocal {{critic of}} the {{doctrine}} of <b>mutual</b> <b>assured</b> <b>destruction</b> (MAD), which he described a [...] "suicide pact". In his 1983 speech, he called upon the scientists and engineers of the United States to develop a system that would render nuclear weapons obsolete. SDI was an important part of his defense policy, intended to end MAD as a nuclear deterrence strategy. A wide array of advanced weapon concepts, including lasers, particle beam weapons and ground- and space-based missile systems were studied, along with various sensor, command and control, and high-performance computer systems that would be needed to control a system consisting of hundreds of combat centers and satellites spanning the entire globe. A number of these concepts were tested through the late 1980s, and follow-on efforts and spin-offs continue to this day.|$|E

Several popular novels—such as Alas, Babylon and On the Beach—portrayed the aftermath of nuclear war.
