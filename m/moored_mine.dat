25|$|In the 1970s, China had {{successfully}} developed non-contact fuses {{such as the}} acoustic fuse, and earlier contact fuse equipped mines were upgraded with non-contact fuses. Also in 1970, Fengxi Machinery Factory and Engineering Technology Equipment Research Institute begun to jointly develop a riverine <b>moored</b> <b>mine</b> that can be remotely controlled fuse. The project was completed in 1974, and the ultrasonic remote control can be either used to arm or disarm the mines, or alternatively, directly detonate the mine.|$|E
25|$|Most PLAN destroyers, frigates, {{littoral}} {{craft and}} submarines can lay mines. Chinese mines vary in type, from basic contact/magnetic mines to more modern and complex systems. China first decided to establish dedicated factories for naval mines in 1954, and in 1958, several programs of naval mines were launched simultaneously by Fengxi Machinery Factory. The first of these, Moored-1 (Mao-1), a large sized <b>moored</b> <b>mine</b> entered mass production in 1962 after being tested multiple times and {{evaluated by the}} navy. Most early Chinese mines are either Soviet origin, or direct copies of Soviet mines, {{with the exception of}} remotely controlled mine.|$|E

5000|$|Classical minesweeping: Against <b>moored</b> <b>mines</b> the {{classical}} minesweeping using towed wire cutters {{to cut the}} anchors of mines can be conducted.|$|R
50|$|The ATK/Raytheon ROV is {{a similar}} system, but has a 1500 m tether cable, and also carries cable cutters for dealing with {{tethered}} or <b>moored</b> <b>mines,</b> and explosive charges to detonate the mines.|$|R
2500|$|Arriving in area V-l, about [...] {{southwest}} of Okinawa, on 24 March, Vigilance {{and her sister}} minesweepers swept for moored mines until nightfall when they retired. She cut loose one <b>moored</b> <b>mine</b> on the 26th, three on the 27th, {{and one on the}} 28th. While performing these sweep operations, she served as MinRon 4 [...] "destruction vessel", slated to destroy loose mines once they reached the surface. The ship sank several drifting floats and one <b>moored</b> <b>mine</b> with gunfire.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 June 1941 the British {{launched}} Operation Chronometer, {{landing a}} battalion of troops from the British Indian army at Assab, the last Italian-held harbour on the Red Sea. [...] By 11 June, Assab had fallen. Two days later, on 13 June, the Indian trawler Parvati became the last naval casualty of the East African Campaign when it struck a <b>moored</b> <b>mine</b> near Assab.|$|E
50|$|The MP1 is a {{cable cutter}} to surface the <b>moored</b> <b>mine</b> for {{recovery}} exploitation or Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD).|$|E
50|$|Also {{on display}} {{are a large}} Holman-made riveted wrought iron Cornish boiler from the nearby Medlyn <b>Moor</b> <b>Mine,</b> dating from {{the mid to late}} 1800s; a few {{historic}} narrow gauge explosives wagons; several antique Cornish beam engines; and other models including scale model working engines.|$|R
50|$|This {{comprises}} two <b>moored,</b> floating contact <b>mines</b> {{which are}} tethered {{together by a}} length of steel cable or chain. Typically, each mine is situated approximately 60 ft away from its neighbour, and each floats a few metres {{below the surface of}} the ocean. When the target ship hits the steel cable, the mines on either side are drawn down the side of the ship's hull, exploding on contact. In this manner it is almost impossible for target ships to pass safely between two individually <b>moored</b> <b>mines.</b> Daisy-chained mines are a very simple concept which was used during World War II.|$|R
50|$|They had {{a shallow}} draught (8 feet, 2.43 metres). Armament was one QF 4 in gun forward and a QF 12 pounder aft, plus two twin 0.303 inch machine guns. They were {{equipped}} for sweeping with Oropesa floats only, {{that is to}} cut the cables of <b>moored</b> <b>mines.</b>|$|R
50|$|The MP3 is a <b>moored</b> <b>mine</b> cable gripper and a float {{with the}} MP2 bomblet {{combination}} to neutralize moored mines underwater.|$|E
50|$|Moored-4 (锚-4, Mao-4) <b>moored</b> <b>mine</b> {{developed}} by Fengxi Machinery Factory (汾西机器厂) was accepted into service in November 1973, {{and it is}} the first <b>moored</b> <b>mine</b> in the Chinese service that incorporates acoustic fuse. The mine can be planted by both the surface ships and submarines from depth of 20-200 meters, and it weighs 600 kg. The mine has an effective radius of 20 meters and effective life of 2 years. The original Moored-4 was upgraded to Moored-4-I (锚-4甲, Mao-4-Jia) standard in November 1982, and subsequently upgraded into Moored-4-II (锚-4乙, Mao-4-Yi) standard by December 1985. In comparison to earlier versions, the latest version adopted large scale integrated circuits.|$|E

25|$|However, Salvor towed ex-Basswood from Pearl Harbor to San Francisco, California from 22 to 31 March 1999. Salvor then {{sailed to}} San Diego, California, where she participated in {{exercise}} Kernel Blitz '99 from 12 to 29 April. During this exercise, Salvor conducted mine field security, MK 5 Marine Mammal operations, and recovery of <b>moored</b> <b>mines.</b>|$|R
50|$|The ships use AN/SLQ-48 {{remotely}} operated mine disposal system supplied by Alliant Techsystems (ATK) and the EX116 Mod 0 {{remotely operated}} vehicle (ROV) mine neutralization system supplied by ATK and Raytheon. The AN/SLQ-48 detects, locates, classifies, and neutralizes <b>moored</b> <b>mines</b> and mines resting on the seabed. The vehicle uses high-frequency, high-resolution sonar, low light level television (LLLTV), cable cutters, and explosive charges to detect and dispose of mines, while remaining tethered to the vessel by a 1070 m cable and under control of the vessel.|$|R
50|$|Bottom mines {{are used}} {{when the water}} {{is no more than}} 60 m deep or when mining for {{submarines}} down to around 200 m. They are much harder to detect and sweep, and can carry a much larger warhead than a <b>moored</b> <b>mine.</b> Bottom mines commonly utilize multiple types of sensors, which are less sensitive to sweeping.|$|E

50|$|The Type X was {{originally}} {{designed specifically to}} accommodate the newly developed Schachtmine A (SMA) <b>moored</b> <b>mine.</b> The initial design provided dry storage for the mines, which needed their detonators to be individually adjusted before launch; this submarine was projected to have displaced up to 2,500 tonnes. A further variant, the Type XA was projected, which would have supplemented the main mine chamber with extra mine shafts in the saddle tanks. Neither type entered production.|$|E

50|$|The {{paravane}} {{weapon was}} developed by the British inventor Sir Dennistoun Burney as a means to sweep enemy mines. Towed behind a ship, the paravane wire would either cut the <b>mine's</b> <b>mooring</b> cable or bring the mine and paravane together, detonating the mine. There are offensive and defensive paravanes. There are main paravanes and auxiliary protector paravanes. Some paravanes are equipped with cable cutters that cut the <b>moored</b> <b>mines.</b> Explosive paravanes are essentially a towable or controllable mine. The US Department of Defense continues to have interest in paravanes.|$|R
50|$|The repairs were {{completed}} three weeks {{ahead of schedule}} {{at a cost of}} $89.5 million, $3.5 million less than expected. By comparison, , which was damaged by a <b>moored</b> <b>mine</b> during the 1991 Gulf War, was repaired for $24 million; however, the cruiser was not directly struck by the mine and her displacement is nearly twice that of Samuel B. Roberts. The mine that nearly sank Samuel B. Roberts had an estimated cost of $1,500.|$|E

50|$|The Drifting-2 (漂-2, or Piao-2) {{drifting}} mine {{is a small}} drifting mine jointly {{developed by}} the 710th Research Institute and Dalian Crane Factory. This drifting mine system {{is the first in}} Chinese service {{to be able to be}} taken apart for easier transportation, and then assembled just before being planted, and it is designed to float just below the surface of the water to avoid being visually detected. This mine is mainly for riverine and coastal use and can also be used as part of the <b>moored</b> <b>mine</b> system.|$|E

50|$|Halligan {{continued}} her offshore patrols 26 March. At about 18:35 a tremendous explosion rocked the ship, sending smoke and debris 200 {{feet in the}} air. The destroyer had hit a <b>moored</b> <b>mine</b> head on, exploding the forward magazines and blowing off the forward section of the ship including the bridge, back to the forward stack. PC-1128 and USS LSM(R)-194 arrived soon after the explosion to aid survivors. Ensign Richard L. Gardner, the senior surviving officer who was uninjured organized rescue parties and directed the evacuation of the living to waiting rescue vessels. Finally, he gave the order to abandon ship as the smoking hulk drifted helplessly.|$|E
5000|$|... === Patrol and escort duties === Aside from an {{occasional}} {{day or so}} of maintenance and upkeep, Vigilance patrolled off Ulithi's Mugai channel {{for the remainder of}} the year. Following an escort mission to the Palaus from 5 to 11 January 1945, Vigilance returned to Ulithi on the 12th, only to find a full-scale antisubmarine alert in progress. She commenced patrolling station number 7 in company with [...] before receiving orders to patrol off the Zowariyau and Piiriperiperi channels. Shifting to a retiring search in company with [...] soon thereafter, Vigilance was relieved of this duty by [...] and returned to Ulithi. After local patrol operations off the Mugai channel, Vigilance performed local escort missions between Ulithi and Kossol Roads and from Kossol Roads to Seeadler Harbor, at Manus, in the Admiralties. For the latter part of February, the minesweeper served as submarine listening watch and harbor entrance patrol vessel at Kossol before she returned to Ulithi. From 6 to 8 March, Vigilance lay alongside [...] undergoing availability in preparation for the upcoming operation against the Ryūkyūs. Vigilance got underway for Nansei Shoto on 19 March and steamed in cruising formation with Mine Division (MinDiv) 11, on the starboard quarter of USS Terror. Arriving in area V-l, about 35 mi southwest of Okinawa, on 24 March, Vigilance and her sister minesweepers swept for moored mines until nightfall when they retired. She cut loose one <b>moored</b> <b>mine</b> on the 26th, three on the 27th, and one on the 28th. While performing these sweep operations, she served as MinRon 4 [...] "destruction vessel", slated to destroy loose mines once they reached the surface. The ship sank several drifting floats and one <b>moored</b> <b>mine</b> with gunfire.|$|E
5000|$|... 1942 minelaying used a new Mk XXII mine with a buoyant {{copper tube}} upper antenna {{replacing}} the solid copper wire and buoyant float of the Mk XX mines. The minelaying cruiser [...] laid the first M Mk I <b>moored</b> magnetic <b>mines</b> {{and became a}} regular participant in first Minelaying Squadron missions from May through November 1942. Portions of the Denmark Strait minefield damaged by ice were relaid with M Mk I <b>moored</b> magnetic <b>mines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The typhoon abated that evening; and, on {{the morning}} of 18 October, Zeal {{returned}} to resume her sweep. That day brought the warship her first contact with the Japanese. After she had cut a few <b>moored</b> <b>mines,</b> a [...] "Val" [...] dive-bomber flew over and dropped two bombs which missed nearby [...] by about 200 yards. The Japanese plane made its attack and retired before any gun crews could man their battle stations.|$|R
50|$|In {{the fall}} of 1961 Cusk had her Regulus missile {{guidance}} equipment removed and reverted to attack submarine profile. After successfully shooting a MK 14 Mod 3 warshot torpedo at the target cliffs on Kahoolawe Island she departed for WesPac in January 1962. Designated as the SubFlot 7 Mining platform during the deployment, Cusk offloaded all steam torpedoes at Cubi Point NAS that spring and reloaded 4 MK 27 Mobile drill mines and 18 MK 10 <b>moored</b> drill <b>mines.</b> 12 days after departure from Subic Bay, Cusk entered the shallow waters of Buckner Bay Okinawa submerged, launched the 4 MK 27 mobile mines and then planted a field of 18 MK 10 <b>moored</b> <b>mines.</b> following the successful mine plant Cusk returned to Subic Bay RP, and retrieved her MK 14 Mod 3 warshot torpedoes.|$|R
