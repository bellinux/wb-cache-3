500|$|Writing in {{his book}} Reinventing Music Video: Next-generation Directors, Their Inspiration, and Work, British author-director Matt Hanson claimed some <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> video the duo's first action {{sequence}} and stated it could be considered [...] "a high-octane version" [...] of Albert Lamorisse short film The Red Balloon. [...] "While [...] was a poetic 1956 study of a boy befriended by a balloon, here the action is reversed and revved up, with the basketball defiantly trying to bounce {{away from the city}} street kid," [...] Hanson said.|$|E
500|$|The {{film has}} also been noted by scholar Philip Simpson as {{highlighting}} [...] "the divide between the underprivileged and privileged classes," [...] {{as well as for}} its inversion of commonly-held beliefs about violence in urban areas and pastoral ethics: [...] "The Strangers, as many horror films do... undermines the conventional notion of rural society as a simpler, crime-free place. One <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> narrative sensibility informing The Strangers 'pastoral paranoia', in that danger lurks among the rough folk of the country rather than the suburbs and cities. Of course, it may be that provincial violence is a result of contamination, or in other words that the kind of stranger-upon-stranger violence typically associated with urban life metastasizes to the rural, a phenomenon noted by Louis Wirth." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{an essay}} in 1999, he {{identified}} {{what he saw as}} the harmful role played by sentimentality in a case involving Stephen Lawrence. Lawrence, a young black British man, was murdered and the subsequent case was mired in accusations of racism among the investigating police. Dalrymple wrote that [...] "the response to the Stephen Lawrence case is another example of how the rule of law is to be supplanted by the rule of sentiment—and it is yet one more instance of what one <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> Dianafication of British public life, in which transitory popular enthusiasm trumps venerable tradition". In a 2004 essay, he analysed how sentimentality towards children was closely linked with violence and neglect, particularly in the poorest sections of British society: [...] "The upbringing of children in much of Britain is a witches' brew of sentimentality, brutality, and neglect, in which overindulgence in the latest fashions, toys, or clothes, and a television in the bedroom are regarded as the highest—indeed only—manifestations of tender concern for a child's welfare".|$|E
500|$|New York magazine's Amy Odell {{commented that}} [...] "The {{intricacy}} of her [...] wardrobe [...] suggests she's feeling the Gaga pressure." [...] She further added: [...] "In a burgeoning phenomenon we <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> Gaga Effect, divas everywhere may {{feel the pressure}} to push avant-garde fashion to the max {{to keep up with}} the pantsless wonder. Beyoncé's fashion efforts in 'Video Phone'— which make her epic diva money fan a mere distant memory— deserve a look-by-look analysis, because she tried really hard." [...] In another review, she said [...] "Together they play with colored fire-spitting water guns and look like the best of diva friends." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Leah Greenblatt commented that the video was [...] "B's show—La Gaga's just guesting in it." [...] Greenblatt also praised the fashion designs used in the video and the Bettie Page [...] "vibes". Spins Chris Zakorchemny felt that Gaga [...] "does her best Beyonce impression" [...] in the video for the song. However, he said that [...] "Even with Gaga involved, the Hype Williams-produced video doesn't veer too much into the weird; it's certainly not Gaga-setting-men-on-fire weird." [...] Margaret Wappler of The Arizona Republic praised the video saying that it had [...] "electrifying color schemes and high-shine lighting, resulting in a fantastical pop mirage between Lady Gaga and Beyonce". She further called it a [...] "kinetic spectacle to behold, with enough guns to make Ted Nugent weep with jealousy and some hot Bettie Page bangs on Beyonce that should prompt plenty of ladies to run to the hairdresser". Wappler finished her review by concluding that [...] "the whole video has a distinct and not unpleasant 90s vibe." [...] Francesca Stabile of The Village Voice gave a positive review for the video praising the outfits used in the video and the [...] "oversized sequined sweater that makes an appearance toward the end".|$|E

2500|$|Kennings {{are also}} a {{significant}} technique in Beowulf. They are evocative poetic descriptions of everyday things, often created to fill the alliterative requirements of the metre. For example, a poet <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> sea the [...] "swan-road" [...] or the [...] "whale-road"; a king {{might be called a}} [...] "ring-giver." [...] There are many kennings in Beowulf, and the device is typical of much of classic poetry in Old English, which is heavily formulaic. The poem also makes extensive use of elided metaphors.|$|E
2500|$|Author Phillip Evans said in 2014 that [...] "Henderson's central {{idea was}} what you <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> Napoleonic idea of concentrating mass against weakness, of {{overwhelming}} the enemy. What Henderson recognized was that, in the business world, there are many phenomena which are characterized by what economists would call increasing returns—scale, experience. The more you do of something, disproportionately the better you get. And therefore he found a logic for investing in such kinds of overwhelming mass {{in order to achieve}} competitive advantage. And that was the first introduction of essentially a military concept of strategy into the business world. ... It was on those two ideas, Henderson's idea of increasing returns to scale and experience, and Porter's idea of the value chain, encompassing heterogenous elements, that the whole edifice of business strategy was subsequently erected." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Diamond Age" [...] is an {{extension}} of labels for archeological time periods that take central technological materials to define an entire era of human history, such as the Stone Age, the Bronze Age or the Iron Age. Technological visionaries such as Eric Drexler and Ralph Merkle, both of whom receive an honorary mention in The Diamond Age, have argued that if nanotechnology develops the ability to manipulate individual atoms at will, it will become possible to simply assemble diamond structures from carbon atoms, materials also known as diamondoids. Merkle states: [...] "In diamond, then, a dense network of strong bonds creates a strong, light, and stiff material. Indeed, just as we named the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Steel Age after the materials that humans could make, we <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> new technological epoch we are entering the Diamond Age". In the novel, a near future vision of our world, nanotechnology has developed precisely to this point, which enables the cheap production of diamond structures.|$|E

2500|$|The perp walk {{has been}} {{described}} as primarily serving the interests of the police and the media rather than the defendant or justice. [...] "Cynics <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> perp walk the crime reporter's red carpet", says crime reporter Art Miller. [...] "Police and prosecutors get to show off their trophy. [...] lap it up because that's all we know we're going to get" [...] since so many other aspects {{of the criminal justice system}} prior to trial take place out of public view, and even trials themselves may not always be televised or even photographed. [...] "Those 30 seconds of a perp walk are the lifeblood to the TV news. Between that and the mug shot that is often all you got as visuals to tell a crime story." [...] Retired NYPD detective Nicholas Casale likens it to a service: [...] "It promotes the arrest, it allows the defendant an opportunity to make a statement to the press, and it's centralized".|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, {{the turn}} towards {{building}} a synthesizer of sorts over an organ came to fruition in Moog’s Polymoog. [...] Many patents exist from this keyboard. [...] It incorporated velocity sensitivity for one thing. [...] Each note {{had its own}} circuit board with a VCF/VCA chip {{so that it was}} truly fully polyphonic. [...] Many were disappointed that the filter lacked the facilities of the more flexible moog filter used in other keyboards. [...] And that there were so many connectors and they were not all that reliable. Also in 1975 Crumar of Italy produced the [...] "Multiman" [...] which also was an organ with synthesizer facilities. [...] It had a bass option, a brass with filter controls and simple envelope, a piano and clavi preset, and a couple string tabs with decay control and vibrato control. [...] The first of what we <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> 'Swiss army knife' synthesizer. In 1976 the ARP Omni combined a more limited synthesizer with a string machine and bass also and became ARP's biggest seller.|$|E
2500|$|Richardson {{is also an}} {{important}} feminist writer, because of the way her work assumes the validity and importance of female experiences as a subject for literature. She records that when she began writing, [...] "attempting to produce a feminine equivalent of the current masculine realism", and after setting aside [...] "a considerable mass of manuscript" [...] finding [...] "a fresh pathway". Her wariness of the conventions of language, her bending of the normal rules of punctuation, sentence length, and so on, are used to create a feminine prose, which Richardson saw as necessary for the expression of female experience. Virginia Woolf in 1923 noted, that Richardson [...] "has invented, or, if she has not invented, developed and applied to her own uses, a sentence which we <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> psychological sentence of the feminine gender." [...] In her 1938 [...] "Foreword" [...] to the Collected Edition of Pilgrimage Richardson responded to criticism of her writing, [...] "for being unpunctuated and therefore unreadable", arguing that [...] "Feminine prose, as Charles Dickens and James Joyce show themselves to be aware, should properly be unpunctuated, moving from point to point without formal obstruction".|$|E

Because the septimal semicomma is {{tempered}} out, a chord with intervals 6:5-6:5-6:5-7:6, spanning the octave, {{is a part of}} the septimal meantone tuning system. This chord <b>might</b> be <b>called</b> <b>the</b> septimal semicomma diminished seventh. Similarly, because the septimal kleisma is tempered out, a chord with intervals of size 5:4-5:4-9:7 spans the octave; this <b>might</b> be <b>called</b> <b>the</b> septimal kleisma augmented triad, and is likewise a characteristic feature of septimal meantone.|$|R
