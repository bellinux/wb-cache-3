30|$|Modeling {{exchange}} rate volatility has remained crucially important because of its diverse implications. Bala and Asemota (2013) examined {{exchange rate}} volatility using GARCH models. They used <b>monthly</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> return series for the naira (Nigerian currency) against the US dollar ($), British pound, and euro. To compare the estimates, various GARCH models were estimated with and without volatility breaks. It was revealed {{that most of the}} models rejected the existence of a leverage effect, except for those with volatility breaks. Since it was observed that results improved when the volatility models considered breaks, incorporating significant events in the GARCH models was suggested. Clement and Samuel (2011) also aimed to model Nigerian {{exchange rate volatility}}. They used the <b>monthly</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> of the naira against the US dollar and British pound for the period from 2007 to 2010. They found that the exchange rate return series was nonstationary and that the series residuals were asymmetric. Since return volatility was found to be persistent, the study recommended further investigation of the impact of government policies on foreign exchange rates.|$|E
