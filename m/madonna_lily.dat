500|$|The lily {{appears in}} ancient {{literature}} associated with both sovereignty and virginal innocence, and is mentioned {{on a number}} of occasions in the Bible, such as the description in Solomon's Song of Songs (2, 1–2) [...] "I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys. Like a lily among thorns is my darling among the young women" [...] or the Gospel of Mathew (6, 28) [...] "Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin" [...] to represent beauty. Artistic representations can be found as far back as frescos from the second century BC, at Amnisos and Knossos. Early Christian churches, such as that of the Basilica of Sant' Apollinare in Classe were sometimes decorated with lilies. While predominantly depicted as white, those seen at Akrotiri are red lilies. The white lily has long been seen as a symbol of purity, coming to be associated with the Virgin Mary in the Middle Ages, from which came the name ‘Madonna lily’ (Lilium candidum). A well-known example is Leonardo da Vinci's Annunciation (1472–1475) in which the archangel Gabriel bears a <b>Madonna</b> <b>lily.</b> Other symbolic meanings include glory, love and birth.|$|E
500|$|The {{first record}} of a named {{cultigen}} occurs in De Agri Cultura. written about 160 BCE by Roman statesman Cato the Elder (234–149 BCE) in a list that includes 120 kinds (cultivars) of figs, grapes, apples and olives. The names are presented {{in a way that}} implies that they would have been familiar to fellow Romans. The [...] "cultivar" [...] names were mostly of one word and denoted the provenance of the cultivar (the geographical origin of the place where the plant selections were made). Writers up to the 15th century added little to this early work. In the Middle Ages the book of hours, early herbals, illuminated manuscripts and economic records indicate that plants grown by the Romans found their way into monastery gardens. For example, in 827 CE the following herbs were mentioned in the poem Hortulus by Walafrid Strabo as growing in the monastery garden of St Gallen in Switzerland: sage, rue, southernwood, wormwood, horehound, fennel, German iris, lovage, chervil, <b>Madonna</b> <b>lily,</b> opium poppy, clary, mint, betony, agrimony, catmint, radish, gallica rose, bottle gourd and melon. It seems likely that aromatic and culinary herbs were quite widespread and similar lists of plants occur in records of plants grown in Villa gardens at the time of Charlemagne (742–814 CE).|$|E

60|$|Wednesday morning dawned {{as bright}} and fair as if {{expressly}} {{made to order}} for the picnic. Birds sang around Green Gables; the <b>Madonna</b> <b>lilies</b> in the garden sent out whiffs of perfume that entered in on viewless winds at every door and window, and wandered through halls and rooms like spirits of benediction. The birches in the hollow waved joyful hands as if watching for Anne's usual morning greeting from the east gable. But Anne was not at her window. When Marilla took her breakfast up to her she found the child sitting primly on her bed, pale and resolute, with tight-shut lips and gleaming eyes.|$|R

60|$|Then it {{was that}} for the first time I saw Natalie, for owing to a mistake of my driver I had arrived rather late and had not been {{introduced}} to her. As her father's only daughter, her mother being dead, she was seated at the end of the table behind a fan-like arrangement of white <b>Madonna</b> <b>lilies,</b> and she had bent forward and, like the others, was looking at me, but in such a fashion that her head from that distance seemed as though it were surrounded and crowned with lilies. Indeed the greatest art could not have produced a more beautiful effect which was, however, really one of naked accident.|$|R

Beyond the border of flowers was Meg, bending over the gooseberry bushes. She saw us and came swinging down the path, {{with a bowl of}} gooseberries poised on her hip. She was dressed in a plain, fresh holland frock, with a white apron. Her black, heavy hair reflected the sunlight, and her ripe face was luxuriant with laughter.|$|R

Mrs. Morel was strong on her feet again. He was not going to stick to Miriam. Very well; then she would stand aloof till he said something. It had been coming a long time, this bursting of the storm in him, when he would come back to her. This evening there was between them a peculiar condition of suspense. He worked feverishly and mechanically, so that he could escape from himself. It grew late. Through the open door, stealthily, came the scent of <b>madonna</b> <b>lilies,</b> almost as if it were prowling abroad. Suddenly he got up and went out of doors.|$|R

It is currently held in the Kremlin Armoury Museum in Moscow, and it is one of the few Fabergé eggs that have never left Russia.|$|E
5000|$|The botanic name Lilium is the Latin {{form and}} is a Linnaean name. The Latin name {{is derived from the}} Greek λείριον, leírion, {{generally}} assumed to refer to true, white lilies as exemplified by the <b>Madonna</b> <b>lily.</b> The word was borrowed from Coptic (dial. Fayyumic) hleri, from standard hreri, from Demotic hrry, from Egyptian hrṛt [...] "flower". Meillet maintains that both the Egyptian and the Greek word are possible loans from an extinct, substratum language of the Eastern Mediterranean. The Greeks also used the word κρῖνον, krīnon, albeit for non-white lilies.|$|E
50|$|Mary’s Garden is {{designed}} to remediate a coal mining site, which was purchased by the Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary in 1969. The garden incorporates elements that purify water and provide wildlife habitat while also referencing the cultural, geological and natural history of the place. Two large sculptural formations, <b>Madonna</b> <b>Lily</b> and Mary’s Rose, based on traditional religious symbols, shape the two main areas of the five-acre site. Remnants of mining activity and forms made of local stratified rock reference the previous, industrial uses {{of the land and}} geological eras. Seating and pathways offer opportunities for relaxation and contemplation of plants and wildlife at close range.|$|E
60|$|They {{passed a}} mansion of those proud {{old days when}} whalers and China traders and West-Indiamen brought home gold and blacks, Cashmere shawls and sweet sandalwood, Malay oaths and the jawbones of whales. The Applebys could see by the {{electric}} lights bowered in the lilac-bushes that a stately grass walk, lined with <b>Madonna</b> <b>lilies</b> and hollyhock and phlox, led to the fanlight-crested white door, above which hung the mocking tea-pot sign. The house was lighted, the windows open. To {{the right of the}} hall was the arts-shop where, among walls softened with silky Turkish rugs and paintings of blue dawn amid the dunes, were tables of black-and-white china, sports hats, and Swiss toys, which the Grimsby summer colony meekly bought at the suggestion of the sprightly Miss Mitchin.|$|R
6000|$|... 82. For {{consider}} a little what {{each of those}} five tribes* {{has been to the}} spirit of man. First, in their nobleness, the lilies gave the lily of the Annunciation; the asphodels, the flower of the Elysian fields; the irids, the fleur-de-lys of chivalry; and the amaryllids, Christ's lily of the field; while the rush, trodden always under foot, became the emblem of humility. Then take each of the tribes, and consider the extent of their lower influence. Perdita's [...] "The crown imperial, lilies of all kinds," [...] are the first tribe, which, giving the type of perfect purity in the <b>Madonna's</b> <b>lily,</b> have, by their lovely form, influenced the entire decorative design of Italian sacred art; while ornament design of war was continually enriched by the curves of the triple petals of the Florentine [...] "giglio," [...] and French fleur-de-lys; so {{that it is impossible to}} count their influence for good in the middle ages, partly as a symbol of womanly character, and partly of the utmost brightness and refinement of chivalry in the city which was the flower of cities.|$|R
50|$|With 3,315 residents, Mqabba has the {{characteristics}} of a typical Maltese village, with stillness prevailing in the small streets of the village. Mqabba was built around the Parish Church, the landmark of the village. The church is dedicated to the Assumption, with its feast being held every 15 August. The feast of Our Lady of <b>Lilies</b> (<b>Madonna</b> tal-Gilju) is celebrated on the third Sunday of June.|$|R
50|$|Lilium candidum, the <b>Madonna</b> <b>lily,</b> is a {{plant in}} the true lily family. It is native to the Balkans and Middle East, and {{naturalized}} {{in other parts of}} Europe, including France, Italy, and Ukraine, and in North Africa, the Canary Islands, Mexico, and other regions. It forms bulbs at ground level, and, unlike other lilies, grows a basal rosette of leaves during winter, which die the following summer. A leafy floral stem, which generally grows 1.2 m tall, but exceptionally 2 m tall, emerges in late spring and bears several sweetly and very fragrant flowers in summer. The flowers are pure white and tinted yellow in their throats.|$|E
50|$|Wall {{paintings}} {{dated to}} around 1700-1600 BC from Minoan Akrotiri provide {{some of the}} earliest evidence for the apparently ornamental use of bulbous plants. Some of the plants in the frescos are clearly lilies, which have usually been identified as Lilium candidum. However, this species has white flowers, and those in the frescos are red, which suggests they may be Lilium chalcedonicum. L. candidum, the <b>Madonna</b> <b>lily,</b> was later used as a symbol in Christianity, where the Virgin Mary was represented with lilies in her hands. The symbol of the Fleur de Lys was originally based on the flower of a species of Iris (Iris pseudacorus) that appeared in Egyptian and Indian religious paintings long before it was adopted as the emblem of the kings of France in the 5th Century.|$|E

50|$|The {{dress was}} to be a {{historic}} masterpiece befitting the occasion, consequently one that would stand out. Like her bridal gown, the costume was designed by Norman Hartnell. Hartnell proposed at least eight different designs; the first, very simple, similar to that worn by Queen Victoria at her Coronation; the second, a modern slim-fitting sheath gown, embroidered in gold; the third, a crinoline style coronation dress of white satin, silver tissue and crusty silver lace; the fourth, white satin embroidered with <b>Madonna</b> and arum <b>lilies</b> and encrusted with pendant pearls; the fifth, a colourful design of violets, roses and wheat, the sixth, white satin with gold, silver and copper embroideries featuring branches of oak leaves with acorns; the seventh, the Tudor Rose of England, appliqued in gold tissue against white satin; and the eighth, similar to the seventh, but incorporating the floral emblems of Great Britain and the Commonwealth. The Queen favoured the last option if Hartnell introduced some colour and made some adjustments; a ninth design was then drawn up and presented to Elizabeth at Sandringham. Later Hartnell secretly added an embroidered extra four-leaved shamrock {{on the left side of}} her dress as an omen for good fortune.|$|R
5000|$|In liturgical {{iconography}} and statuary Saint Brigid {{is often}} depicted holding a reed cross, a crozier {{of the sort}} used by abbots, and a lamp. Early hagiographers portray Saint Brigid's life and ministry as touched with fire. According to P.W. Joyce, tradition holds that nuns at her monastery kept a sacred eternal flame burning there. Leitmotifs, some of them borrowed from the apocrypha such as the story where she hangs her cloak on a sunbeam, {{are associated with the}} wonder tales of her hagiography and folklore. In her Lives, Saint Brigid is portrayed as having the power to multiply such things as butter, bacon and milk, to bestow sheep and cattle and to control the weather. Plant motifs associated with St Brigid include the white Lilium candidum popularly known since medieval times as the <b>Madonna</b> <b>Lily</b> for its association with the Virgin Mary, and the Winflower Anemone coronaria, called the [...] "Brigid anemone" [...] since the early 19th century. Kildare, the church of the oak Quercus petraea, is associated with a tree sacred to the druids. The color associated with Brigid is white and was worn not only by the Kildare United Irishmen during the 1798 rebellion, but also by Kildare sports teams in more recent times.|$|E
5000|$|The {{utilitarian}} approach, classifying plants {{according to}} their medicinal properties, is exemplified {{by the work of}} Roman nobleman, scientist and historian, Pliny the Elder (29-79 CE) author of Naturalis historiae. [...] "Cultivars" [...] listed here are named after people, places or special plant characteristics. Most notable is the work of Dioscorides (ca.40-ca.90 CE) a Greek doctor who worked with the Roman army. His five-volume Materia Medica was a forerunner of the herbal which led to the modern pharmacopoeia. This work was endlessly plagiarised by later herbals including those printed between about 1470 and 1670 CE: it listed 600 to 1000 different kinds of plants including the cultigens Gallica, Centifolia, the rose of uncertain origin known as Alba and other rose cultivars grown by the Romans.The first record of a named cultigen occurs in De Agri Cultura. written about 160 BCE by Roman statesman Cato the Elder (234-149 BCE) in a list that includes 120 kinds (cultivars) of figs, grapes, apples and olives.
