40|$|AbstractThe {{paper is}} going to {{quantify}} the mitigation of the insurance as a risk <b>mitigant</b> in operational risk management for the commercial bank. Due to the uncertainties associated with the insurance policy, such as counterparty default, payment uncertainty and the liquidity risk (i. e., delayed payment), the recovery amounts are subjected {{to be kind of}} uncertainty. Thus, the efficiency of insurance as a risk <b>mitigant</b> may be discounted. We aim at going one step further to consider counterparty default, payment uncertainty and liquidity risk. While the counterparty default model focuses on calibration of the default time, the payment uncertainty is set as a non-increasing function depending on loss severity. The key conclusions are that counterparty default does not have significant impact on the capital calibration but still paramount in risk management, and insurance as a risk <b>mitigant</b> indeed improve the operational risk profile of bank and lower the capital requirement to some extent...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{primarily}} aimed at highlighting {{the role and}} significance of asymmetric information in contributing to financial contagion. Furthermore, in emphasising the importance of greater disclosure requirements {{and the need for}} the disclosure of information relating to “close links”, such disclosure being considered vital in assisting the regulator in identifying potential sources of material risks, it illustrates the fact that incentives (such as the reduction in the levels of capital to be retained by institutions), which have the potential to facilitate market based regulation (through non binding regulations), may not necessarily serve as suitable means in the realisation of some of Basel II’s objectives – namely the achievement of “prudentially sound, incentive-compatible and risk sensitive capital requirements”. The paper also attempts to raise the awareness that the operation of risk <b>mitigants</b> does not justify a reduction in the capital levels to be retained by banks – since banks operating with risk <b>mitigants</b> could still be considered inefficient operators of their management information systems (MIS), internal control systems, and risk management processes. The fact that banks possess risk <b>mitigants</b> does not necessarily imply that they are complying with Basel Core Principles for effective supervision (particularly Core Principles 7 and 17) – as the paper will seek to demonstrate. Core Principle 7 not only stipulates that “banks and banking groups satisfy supervisory requirements of a comprehensive management process, ensure that this identifies, evaluates, monitors and controls or mitigates all material risks and assesses their overall capital adequacy in relation to their risk profile, but that such processes correspond to the size and complexity of the institution. ” Certain incentives which assume the form of capital reductions are considered by the Basel Committee to “impose minimum operational standards in recognition that poor management of operational risks (including legal risks) could render such risk <b>mitigants</b> of effectively little or no value and that although partial mitigation is rewarded, banks will be required to hold capital against residual risks”. Information disclosure should be encouraged for several reasons, amongst which include the fact that imperfect information {{is considered to be a}} cause of market failure – which “reduces the maximisation potential of regulatory competition”, and also because disclosure requirements would contribute to the reduction of risks which could be generated when granting reduced capital level rewards to banks who may have poor management systems. ...|$|R

A research report presented to the Graduate School of Business Leadership, University of South AfricaThe previous political dispensation limited black people’s participation in the South African economy. Poor credit records, lack of training, resulting in skills and capacity gaps further limited entry into the lending market. These aspects are considered the main limitations in obtaining finance for the Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs). This research report focuses on how credit risk can be mitigated by commercial banks in lending to Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) companies in the medium to large market. Exploratory research was conducted using various methods to achieve methodological triangulation. These methods consisted of a literature review, interviewing experts in the field and case studies. A qualitative research approach was followed. It was found that the lack of own contribution and security were still prevalent in the medium to large market, but the quality of management (little training and skills) was deemed not to be a limitation as suitable credit risk <b>mitigants</b> were identified. No credit risk <b>mitigants</b> were identified to mitigate poor credit records. It is postulated that by adopting and applying the identified credit risk <b>mitigants,</b> commercial banks can increase their success rate in lending to BEE companies. It will further assist in the transformation of black people and compliance with the Financial Services Charter. It is recommended that a similar study be conducted in the agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing industry. The reasons why BEE companies applications are declined could also be investigated. Further studies could also explore other external factors such as economical, legal and social that could have an influence on the funding of BEE companies...|$|R

The polyphasic rising phase of fluorescence transients displayed by the oxygenic photosynthetic organisms at the initial illumination stage are named as OJIP. In this study, the transient flourescence curves of chlorophyll a with relevant parameters in P. micans were tracked precisely and clarified based on tests of JIP parameters to analyze photosystem II activity. The photosynthetic <b>mitigant</b> roles on P. micans by dried G. tenuistipitata on were obvirously gram- and time-relevant. Chl a fluorescence specific parameters followed the same patterns as the O-J-I-P profiles. Based on the transient flourescence curves with their relevant parameters, the main inhibitory sites by G. tenuistipitata on the photosynthetic appartus of P. micans might be listed as the decline in active numbers of photosystem reactive centers, coupled with blockng-up of the electron-transporting chain.

30|$|In {{the present}} paper we apply this {{framework}} to the concrete setup of a bank engaged in bilateral trade portfolios. In this context, the discounted expectation of losses due to the default of counterparties or of the bank itself are respectively known as CVA (credit valuation adjustment) and DVA (debt valuation adjustment). Counterparty risk <b>mitigants</b> include the variation margin (VM), tracking the mark-to-market of client portfolios, and the initial margin (IM) set as a cushion against gap risk, which is the risk of slippage between the portfolio and its variation margin during liquidation periods. The cost of funding cash collateral for the variation margin is known as funding valuation adjustment (FVA), while the cost of funding segregated collateral posted as initial margin is the margin valuation adjustment (MVA). Contra-liability counterparts of the FVA and the MVA arise as the FDA (funding debt adjustment) and the MDA (margin debt adjustment). The contra-liability component of a unilateral CVA is dubbed CVACL.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are to: define business risk; identify whether economic capital {{could be used to}} mitigate this risk; and investigate business-risk measurement methodologies. Design/methodology/approach – The paper analyzes definitions used in theory and practice and derived a definition. It analyzes three measurement methodologies: analogue companies/peer group analysis, statistical methods, and scenario analysis. These methodologies are tested against the criteria of effective management control, because economic capital is increasingly used as a management control instrument. Findings – Economic capital can be used as business-risk <b>mitigant</b> albeit not the only one. The measurement methodology of scenario analysis satisfies most of the criteria for effective control. Practical implications – This paper opens a discussion to further develop the scenario approach in theory and practice.

40|$|AbstractThe Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has {{a policy}} {{framework}} for how clearing member banks should treat their exposures to central counterparties (CCPs). Default funds {{play a crucial}} role as a risk <b>mitigant</b> in this framework. Furthermore, the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (together abbreviated as CPSS-IOSCO) produced a set of 26 principles for financial market infrastructures. For a CCP to be deemed a qualified CCP, it has to abide by these principles. Clearing member banks with trade exposures to a qualified CCP will get preferential capital treatment under the BCBS framework. None of the principles or the policy framework requires, or forces a CCP to have a default fund. However, regulators prefer CCPs to have default funds in place to enhance their credit risk management practices, as required by principles 4 and 6 of the CPSS-IOSCO, before they will be qualified. We consider the merits of the BCBS's requirements for a clearing house, in a developing country such as South Africa, to become a qualified clearing house and conclude that a CCP with prudent risk management processes and controls, should not be disqualified if a default fund is not established...|$|E

In each market, production is controlled by a few dominant players. Federal courts have traditionally checked the abuses of natural monopolies under the Sherman Act.

This Article situates FMIs at the intersection of four seismic trends. First, the role of FMIs as a <b>mitigant</b> of systemic risk renders their growth inevitable. Second, open access has become fashionable in the regulation of other natural monopolies (e. g., net neutrality rules), but this approach requires precise standards. Third, essential facilities can supplement weak open access regulations, but the doctrine was nearly dismantled by the Supreme Court a decade ago. Finally, the balance between antitrust and regulation is due to be reset, and the next move will likely come from FMIs...|$|E
40|$|Many risks {{associated}} with hedge funds can be addressed through indirect measures aimed at the hedge funds’ counterparties and creditors, nearly {{all of which are}} regulated banks and securities fi rms. Hence, we consider here how indirect supervision has been made more effective over time and how we should be continuing to make it more effective in practice. The theoretical usefulness of hedge funds in making markets more effi cient and more stable is undisputed but does not always materialize in practice. In order to preserve market effi ciency and fi nancial stability, we need therefore to increase incentives for an effective and long lasting market discipline. Not to do anything is simply not an option given the growth of the hedge fund industry and the fact that hedge funds often act no differently from other financial institutions, whose history has shown worth a look by fi nancial watchdogs. Risk management needs to continuously keep pace with fi nancial innovation. This is a challenge for the indirect supervision of hedge funds but also a support to the pragmatism of this approach. In {{order to be able to}} press banks to put enough emphasis on sound risk management, international cooperation is required. Without an international level playing field, short term competitive pressure between banks would indeed most likely derail our efforts. This is a strong and welcome incentive for regulators to be efficient. In addition, the cooperation between banking and securities supervisors should continue to allow indirect supervision to be strengthened and updated as characteristics of the hedge fund business evolve over time. The first <b>mitigant</b> against the {{risks associated}}, for any single institution, with hedge funds is robust internal risk management systems. Hence, specific attention is warranted as regards access by banks to more comprehensive information on their Highly Leveraged Institutions (HLI) counterparties, better incorporation of counterparties’ transparency and credit quality into collateral policies, effective improvements of complex products exposures’ measurement (due account being taken of model risks), enhancements to stress testing (in particular liquidity stress testing). In addition, indirect supervision needs to be leveraged by an improvement in hedge funds broad transparency to the market. Stress tests, indeed, should enable banks to capture their full exposure to a suffi ciently broad range of adverse conditions, including not only their direct exposure to a particular hedge fund but also their overall exposure to market dislocations that might be associated with the failure of one or several hedge funds (second round effects). A second <b>mitigant</b> is an efficient oversight, in particular by banking supervisors, of the trading relations that hedge funds have with their counterparties. In this respect, the Pillar 2 of Basel II (namely the supervisory review process which will deal with all banking risks beyond those covered by Pillar 1 regulatory capital charges) will incorporate some of the risks specifically concentrated in hedge fund exposures, i. e. liquidity risk, concentration risk, tail risk, model risk [...] . It seems also now critical to check that banks’ internal information systems are capable of capturing the full range of exposures to hedge funds. Finally, banks are required by supervisors to hold regulatory capital as a buffer in relation to the risks they take. This capital adequacy requirement forms the third line of defence against the risks that a financial institution assumes today when dealing with hedge funds. Last but not least, micro and macro prudential targets converge when banking supervisors press each individual institution for more comprehensive stress tests and the related risk management actions, including against second round effects, i. e. against systemic instability. ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Risk Management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. South Africa will be {{implementing}} Basel II on 1 January 2008. Basel II provides {{regulatory capital}} requirements for credit risk, market risk and operational risk. The purpose of capital requirements is {{to level the}} playing field for all internationally active banks and to protect consumers against these risks. Although there is an obvious threat of liquidity risk and it is important to correctly measure and manage liquidity risk, it is almost glaringly omitted from Basel II. The result of not managing liquidity risk properly may have dire consequences for banks because a liquidity crisis may happen without warning. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore current practices and to propose guidelines for effective liquidity risk regulation in South Africa. A literature study and quantitative analysis on liquidity risk in South Africa were conducted to assess whether it is valid for regulators to require banks to hold capital for liquidity risk. This study provides conclusions and recommendations on the regulatory treatment of liquidity risk in South Africa under Basel II. Although Pillar 2 reviews a variety of other risks and not only liquidity risk, it is proposed that the liquidity risk part of such reviews is conducted on the basis of a questionnaire used to determine possible gaps between banks' practices and prescribed criteria regarding the management and measurement of liquidity risk. It is important to note that such an approach has a constraint in terms of the substantial amount of work that would have to be done on the regulation of liquidity risk by both regulators and banks. Therefore resource constraints and the cost versus the benefit of such an approach would have to be considered carefully. The all-encompassing conclusion to this study is that capital would not be an effective <b>mitigant</b> for liquidity risk for a number of reasons. Liquidity risk differs from bank to bank and a general capital charge for all banks may not be sensible, therefore liquidity risk should be analysed on a bank-by-bank basis. In other words, capital could be charged for liquidity risk under Pillar 2 (b) of Basel II. Such a capital charge would not serve the purpose of covering losses resulting from liquidity risk, but would instead impose a penalty on banks that are deemed to manage and measure liquidity risk imprudently. Such a penalty would typically be quite small but would serve as an incentive for banks to improve their management and measurement techniques to the desired level as set out by prescribed criteria. The criteria that should be used for determining whether banks measure and manage liquidity risk prudently should be of such a nature that the Bank Supervision Department (BSD) of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) complies with Basel Core Principle 14 : Liquidity Risk in regulating liquidity risk. In addition, it should align the criteria used to the 14 Principles for the sound management of liquidity as prescribed by the Bank for International Settlements and the Institute of International Finance. Furthermore, it is proposed that the BSD should not prescribe to banks which methods to use to report their liquidity risk, because all banks are not the same in terms of size and sophistication. For this reason, banks should be allowed to follow an internal models approach for liquidity risk whereby banks are, subject to regulatory approval, allowed to use their own internal liquidity risk measures to report liquidity risk to the BSD. This approach is similar to the approach followed by the Bundesbank in Germany. A liquidity risk questionnaire could be drafted according to which banks' liquidity risk management and measurement is assessed in terms of the sound Principles for managing liquidity risk and the Basel Core Principles. One questionnaire could be used for the purposes of assessing the quality of banks' liquidity risk management and measurement in terms of a Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) as well as for banks applying for approval of an internal models approach for liquidity risk. The same questionnaire could be used for both purposes, or the questionnaire could be divided into two clear sections whereby all banks are required to answer the SREP (or Pillar 2 (b)) section, and only banks applying for the use of an internal models approach for liquidity risk are required to complete this section. A further conclusion to this study is that the BSD should publish a framework in which its approach to regulating liquidity risk is described in detail. Some aspects that should be included in such a document include a widely-accepted definition for liquidity risk and guidelines/minimum standards for measurement and management techniques for liquidity risk and the process that will be followed under Pillar 2 of Basel II. If the BSD is concerned about the level of potential liquidity risk in the South African banking system, it should consider having the additional instruments that are eligible as collateral included as instruments eligible for liquid asset reserve requirements. An additional <b>mitigant</b> for liquidity risk may be that the BSD requires banks to report their liquidity risk more frequently than the current monthly basis. Master...|$|E
40|$|The {{impacts of}} fund mergers and liquidations are {{significant}} as the managed funds industry continues to evolve. This thesis fills a much needed {{gap in the}} managed funds literature through providing insight into causes and implications of mergers and liquidation of managed funds. The thesis explores this {{through a number of}} aspects. Firstly, the thesis develops a framework for conceptualising the causes of managed funds termination and describes the differences between strategic mergers, distressed mergers and liquidations. Then, the thesis investigates the probabilities of fund termination for Australian, French and UK managed funds, and the relationship between a fund’s probability of termination and various fund characteristics. Further, this thesis investigates the determinants for the funds’ termination status and identifies factors that influence whether a fund is merged or liquidated. Finally, this thesis investigates the impact of alternative weighting schemes on the performance of master trusts - which can serve as <b>mitigants</b> for the impact of mergers and liquidations, specifically addressing the problem of estimation error in forming master trust portfolios. Results from statistical analysis show important insights into the causes of mergers and liquidation of managed funds. It is found that alpha, skewness and fund family size are significant factors influencing a fund’s probability of termination, and that a larger fund is less likely to terminate. Also, skewness and family size significantly influence the termination status of a fund. From these results, this thesis discusses the implications for regulating mergers and liquidations of managed funds...|$|R
40|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{environmental}} effect {{and the economic}} burden of methane (CH 4) emissions from ruminants are driving the search for ways to mitigate rumen methanogenesis. The use of direct-fed microbials (DFM) is one possible option to decrease CH 4 emission from ruminants. Direct-fed microbials are already used in ruminants mainly to increase productivity and to improve health, and are readily accepted by producers and consumers alike. However, studies {{on the use of}} DFM as rumen CH 4 <b>mitigants</b> are scarce. A few studies using Saccharomyces cerevisiae have shown a CH 4 -decreasing effect but, to date, {{there has not been a}} systematic exploration of DFM as modulators of rumen methanogenesis. In this review, we explored biochemical pathways competing with methanogenesis that, potentially, could be modulated by the use of DFM. Pathways involving the redirection of H 2 away from methanogenesis and pathways producing less H 2 during feed fermentation are the preferred options. Propionate formation is an example of the latter option that in addition to decrease CH 4 formation increases the retention of energy from the diet. Homoacetogenesis is a pathway using H 2 to produce acetate, however up to now no acetogen has been shown to efficiently compete with methanogens in the rumen. Nitrate and sulphate reduction are pathways competing with methanogenesis, but the availability of these substances in the rumen is limited. Although there were studies using nitrate and sulphate as chemical additives, use of DFM for improving these processes and decrease the accumulation of toxic metabolites needs to be explored more. There are some other pathways such as methanotrophy and capnophily or modes of action such as inhibition of methanogens that theoretically could be provided by DFM and affect methanogenesis. We conclude that DFM is a promising alternative for rumen methane mitigation that should be further explored for their practical usage...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{political}} changes in Eastern Europe took place, banks {{in this region}} have experienced a significant reorganization in structure, core activities and business understanding. These changes {{have led to the}} development of banking entities which are flexible, open to the new banking perspectives and react promptly to market changes. However, extensively growing Central and Eastern European (“CEE”) markets require financial sources to meet the increasing demand for core banking intermediation. In order to maintain future growth banks will search for funding instruments which allow them to grow without having a balance sheet effect. In this respect structured finance (especially asset securitisation) may be a solution for these banks and also for other institutions looking for diversified funding sources or credit risk <b>mitigants.</b> It is expected that trend to use securitisation structures will gain on importance due to the decrease in the availability of core funding instrument which are currently deposits. CEE banks’ customers are becoming more aware of possibilities on how to allocate their capital efficiently therefore conventional banking and battle for traditional funding sources will become more expensive. Although, recent market turbulences have significantly reduced the demand for structured finance products in developed economies, the role of these instruments will not lose on importance in the future. The growing sophistication of CEE banking industry will force banks to create products which enable them to attract liquidity by more advanced means. Covered bonds, ECB repurchase agreements and privately placed securitisation transactions can give flexibility towards active balance sheet management in the times of significant liquidity problems. The development organisations like KfW, EBRD, IFC or FMO due to their statutory responsibilities can serve as intermediaries and “market maker” investors.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the growing {{military}} conflicts over the past eight years, the focus on traumatic brain injuries sustained from explosive blasts in wartime scenarios has gained tremendous attention in the scientific and medical communities. During previous warfare conflicts in history, military armor was not as technologically advanced as it is today. As a result, the understanding of traumatic brain injuries is limited since previous blast occurrences typically resulted in higher fatalities due to non-primary blast effects. It is, therefore, the intent of this work to advance the knowledge on traumatic brain injuries from explosive blasts. The study focuses on two aspects. The first focus is on surrogate modeling of the human anatomy subjected to blast loading conditions and the resulting behavior that occurs which provides insight into injury mechanisms and needed model validation data. The second focus is on preventive protection against explosive blasts by studying various materials and the effectiveness of each material to attenuate blast profile characteristics. ^ The physical modeling aspect of the study was accomplished by varying surrogate materials, geometric configuration, and blast loading conditions {{in order to determine the}} measurable behavior variations. Quantitative results were obtained through pressure, acceleration, strain, and displacement measurements. These results suggested large initial amplification of pressures at anterior locations near the shell/gel interface. Material property effects and geometric features effects were seen by larger responses with the material of lower stiffness and more severe responses with the facial feature shell models over the solid shell models. Extreme accelerations were experienced with oscillatory behavior over the duration of the blast. In addition, significant relative displacement was observed between the shell and the gel material suggesting large strain values. Further quantitative results were obtained through shadowgraph imaging of the blast scenarios. The shadowgraph imaging confirmed the approximation that global movement of the target was minimal during the blast occurred on a different time scale. The complete results then provided a means of comparison to actual measured behavior from surrogate models to injury mechanisms in computational and clinical trials. Furthermore, the data obtained can be used in computational validation. ^ The blast mitigation aspect of the study was accomplished by applying blast loading conditions to various <b>mitigant</b> materials. Composite structures were constructed using various filler materials which varied density, porosity, viscosity, and particle size. Quantitative results were then obtained by measuring transmitted wave profiles behind the respective samples and comparing to free-field loading conditions. Attenuation effectiveness was then determined by the reduction of blast profile characteristics (peak overpressure, pulse duration, and impulse). The results of these experiments showed that lower density, porous materials caused blast profile resembling scaled air blasts. Specifically shorter wave front rise times and negative overpressure values were observed. The higher density materials exhibited the greatest attenuation by lowering the overall peak pressure, lengthening the duration, and slowing the rise to peak amplitude. This resulted in lower overall impulse values. Furthermore, significant frequency distribution was observed surpassing the effectiveness of the solid foam control sample and the lower density materials. ...|$|E

Experimental and Numerical Analysis of Water Blast Mitigation: Focusing on Solid Water Barriers, Water Sprays, and Water-Sheets. Major Professor: Steven F. Son. School of Mechanical Engineering. An {{explosion}} {{yielding a}} blast wave can cause catastrophic damage {{to people and}} property. To mitigate damage from such an event, a number of investigators have proposed the use of water in various configurations as a shield around a target. Water is very easily controlled, stored, and acquired {{which makes it a}} robust choice for a possible source of a readily available blast <b>mitigant.</b> Multiple water configurations were experimentally and numerically tested to compare and understand the potential of various water configurations as possible blast mitigants. The study of multiple water configurations yielded two main focuses for this research. One of the focuses of this research was to compare multiple water configurations to better explain the underlying physical blast mitigating mechanisms associated with water blast mitigation and blast mitigation in general. The other focus was to highlight the most advantageous water configuration for possible large scale blast mitigation shielding for a high risk target. ^ The experimental work was completed by testing multiple water configurations under blast loading. Each water configuration was experimentally tested with an explosively driven shock tube and specific diagnostic measurement equipment. The water configurations tested include solid water barriers, water sprays, and water-sheets. The mass of water was shown to be relatively similar for the solid water barriers, water-sheet, and water spray. Therefore general blast mitigating comparisons between each water configuration were made knowing minimal mass loading effects were present. The results of each water configuration test helped highlight specific advantageous blast mitigating mechanisms. These advantageous mitigating mechanisms were shown to be; continuous surface areas, impedance mismatches, unconfined masses, controlling for breakup of water configuration, and mass loading. The understanding of these blast mitigating mechanisms meet the first focus and can be used to help design future water mitigation systems or other blast mitigating materials. ^ The most advantageous blast mitigating water configurations was found to be an unconfined free-flowing water-sheet. Here, an approximate water-sheet thickness of 0. 3 cm was tested. The results show that the water-sheet mitigates the initial peak overpressure and impulse of the blast. Further insights into the underlying physics are revealed by a numerical simulation using Sandia 2 ̆ 7 s CTH hydrocode. In simulations and experiments, the air behind the water-sheet experiences two distinct pressure peaks. An initial pressure rise results from the passage of a low pressure blast wave (M 2 ̆ 6 ap; 1) through the intact sheet and into the air downstream of the water-sheet. Following this, the water-sheet breaks apart due to an increase in pressure on the forward surface caused by the buildup of the subsonic detonation products. Passage of the detonation products after breakup results in a second rise in pressure behind the water-sheet. In simulations, an initial perturbation of the water-sheet is shown to affect the breakup time significantly. Additional simulations show that increasing the sheet thickness tends to increase the blast wave mitigation. These results indicate that {{it may be possible to}} optimize the thickness and surface morphology of a water-sheet to effectively mitigate damages due to explosive blast waves through the use of a water-sheet shield. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{effects and}} impact of the recent global {{financial}} crisis, are yet to fade away as being something of the past. Financial markets worldwide, in particular the major first world countries, {{are still trying to}} uncover the real causes that led to the crisis and how best to innovate with new risk <b>mitigants</b> to prevent such a catastrophic fallout from repeating itself. Reformed financial laws were being proposed and passed swiftly to protect the governments as well as its citizens from the so-called bailout packages. It is against this backdrop {{that there has been a}} concerted effort by the G 20 countries to urgently propagate the reform of the Financial Regulatory environment. Whilst to a large extent it can be argued that South Africa may not have been directly impacted by the crisis at the time, its regulatory landscape as an emerging economy was and is by no means fool-proof. As a member of the G- 20 countries South Africa is also obliged to align and review its financial regulatory laws as its financial markets also operate on a global scale. The South African financial markets framework and structure is largely similar in nature to its global counterparts, although on a smaller scale and less innovative. My dissertation sets out the global regulatory reaction following the global financial crisis and its challenges. In particular I deal with the review and intended reforms of the South African financial sector and its prudential regulation. The reforms proposed for South Africa are contained in the Financial Sector Regulation Bill. This bill proposes the “Twin Peaks” model of financial regulation. The Twin Peaks model refers to the creation of two dominant regulators for the financial sector, the Prudential Authority and the Financial Sector Conduct Authority. This regulatory reform is intended to bolster the ability of these two super regulators to have stronger monitoring, supervisory and enforcement powers in proactively preventing, mitigating and anticipating any potential threats to the financial system as well as protecting financial customers. The underlying objectives of these regulatory reforms are aimed at avoiding another global financial crisis as propagated by the G 20 countries. Australia is one of the first countries that has embraced and started to adopt the Twin Peaks model of financial reform. I have chosen to compare the Australian Prudential Authority with the envisaged Prudential Authority for South Africa. In undertaking such a comparative exercise I highlight some of the major differences in terms of how the regulatory authorities are structured in both countries and give an assessment on its impact in enhancing its financial regulatory dispensation. I also point out some of the similarities in each country’s reform process. I note the benefits (little impact on the global financial crisis) that the Australian Prudential Authority has brought to its financial system and conclude that such benefits could also materialise for South Africa’s dispensation if implemented effectively. Finally I conclude with reasons why I think South Africa would benefit from adopting the Twin Peaks model of regulation in the form of the new Prudential Authority. In particular I am of the view that it would be in a much better position to proactively monitor, supervise, enforce and anticipate any systemic risks to its financial system thereby making it more resilient to any crisis. This reform is also intended to concentrate its efforts in protecting financial customers from unfair market conduct and treating them fairly. LL. M...|$|R
