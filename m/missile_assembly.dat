50|$|The Defense Systems Group, {{based in}} the Baltimore, Maryland area, {{produces}} tactical missiles, defense electronics, and medium- and large-caliber ammunition. The division also produces fuzing and warheads for both tactical missiles and munitions; precision metal and composite structures for medium and large-caliber ammunition, military aircraft, ground vehicles, and <b>missile</b> systems; load, <b>assembly,</b> and pack (LAP) of medium caliber munitions; and propellants and powders for the canister and commercial markets.|$|R
50|$|The FPA must be cooled and calibrated. The CLU's IR {{detectors}} {{are cooled}} using a Dewar flask and a closed-cycle Stirling engine, {{but there is}} insufficient space in the missile for a similar solution. Prior to launch, a cooler mounted {{on the outside of}} the launch tube activates the electrical systems in the missile and supplies cold gas from a Joule-Thomson expander to the <b>missile</b> detector <b>assembly</b> while the <b>missile</b> is still in the launch tube. When the missile is fired, this external connection is broken and coolant gas is supplied internally by an onboard argon gas bottle. The gas is held in a small bottle at high pressure and contains enough coolant for the duration of the flight of approximately 19 seconds.|$|R

50|$|There {{were two}} prime movers for the launcher, both with a crane used for <b>missile</b> <b>assembly</b> and a {{generator}} to provide {{power for the}} launcher and missile. The U.S units used the M983 HEMTT with a Hiab 8001 crane and a 30 KW generator. Tactical units in Germany used the M1001 MAN tractor with an Atlas Maschinen GmbH AK4300 M5 crane and a 30 KW generator. Since the new guidance system was self-orienting, the launcher could be emplaced on any surveyed site and the missile launched within minutes.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 44) The {{objective of}} this project is to illustrate the disadvantages of using measured vibration data from the attach point of a substructure during system level vibration as input base excitation levels in a stand alone vibration test of the substructure. A four degree of freedom sping-mass-damping model was used to simulate a simplified missile-to-aircraft interface. The four degrees of freedom corresponded to an aircraft wing, aircraft pylon, missile airframe, and <b>missile</b> seeker <b>assembly.</b> Although the model was geared to a missile-to-aircraft interface, the analysis presented applies to any significant substructure of a total system. A forcing function {{was applied to the}} aircraft wing to simulate both aircraft induced vibration and aerodynamic turbulence. T!he seeker assembly's maximum acceleration response envelope was then calculated throughout the frequency range encompassing the four natural frequencies of the system. The <b>missile</b> airframe's (seeker <b>assembly</b> attach point) maximum acceleration response envelope was also calculated over the same frequency range and then used as an input base excitation to the seeker assembly in a one degree of freeoom, stand alone substructure test. The corresponding one degree of freedom maximum acceleration response envelope of the seeker assembly was then compared to its four degree of freedom system level response envelope. Significant response magnification was found at frequencies in the range of the seeker assembly's natural frequency. This magnification results in a severe overtest of the seeker or any other substructure at the substructure's resonant frequency(s). The effects of notching the input base excitation levels to a substructure during stand alone vibration at frequencies in the range of the substructure's natural frequency(s) is also presented, as well as a note on response control methods...|$|R

5000|$|The {{deployment}} {{was designed}} to initially supplement and then replace gun batteries deployed around the nation's major urban areas and vital military installations. The defense areas consisted of major cities and selected United States Air Force Strategic Air Command bases which were deemed vital to national defense. The original basing strategy projected a central <b>missile</b> <b>assembly</b> point from which missiles would be taken out to prepared above-ground launch racks ringing the defended area. However, the Army discarded this semimobile concept because the system needed {{to be ready for}} instantaneous action to fend off a [...] "surprise attack." [...] Instead, a fixed-site scheme was devised.|$|E
50|$|The first Nike sites {{featured}} above-ground launchers. This quickly {{changed as}} land restrictions forced the Army to construct space-saving underground magazines. Capable of hosting 12 Nike Ajax missiles, each magazine had an elevator that lifted the missile {{to the surface}} in a horizontal position. Once above ground, the missile could be pushedmanually along a railing to a launcher placed parallel to the elevator. Typically, four launchers sat atop the magazine.Near the launchers, a trailer housed the launch control officer and the controls he operated to launch missiles. In addition to the launch control trailer, the launch area contained a generator building with three diesel generators, frequency converters, and <b>missile</b> <b>assembly</b> and maintenance structures.|$|E
50|$|The {{division}} had {{jurisdiction over}} Complex 17 and three <b>missile</b> <b>assembly</b> buildings (e.g. hangars M, L and AA). It supported {{a total of}} 10 Air Force-sponsored Thor-Able, Thor-Able I and Thor-Able II space launches from Pad 17A {{before the end of}} 1959. The division also supported NASA's Pioneer 1 and Pioneer 2 missions, which were launched by Douglas from Pad 17A on 11 October and 8 November 1958, and NASA's Explorer 6 mission, which was launched by Douglas from Pad 17A on 7 August 1959. Under the 6555th Test Wing (Development), the Space Projects Division managed five Thor-Able-Star missions for the Army, the Navy and ARPA in 1960. It also monitored Douglas' preparation and launch of two Thor-Able boosters for NASA's Pioneer 5 deep space mission to Venus in March 1960 and its TIROS-1 weather satellite mission in April 1960.|$|E
50|$|However, by {{the early}} 1990s the Tonghae site was {{reportedly}} expanded from 2 km to 9 km and the following infrastructure was added: a <b>missile</b> <b>assembly</b> facility, a fuel storage facility, a guidance and range control center, and tracking facilities. Since 1984 military rockets of the types Hwasong, Rodong and Taepodong-1 were launched from Musudan-ri. In 1998, North Korean media reported the successful launch of the Kwangmyŏngsŏng-1 satellite by a Baekdusan-1 SLV from Musudan-ri. North Korea claimed their first satellite was successfully placed into orbit, but no independent sources have confirmed this. A review of the rocket engine test stand on DigitalGlobe imagery coverage from February 15, 2002 to February 26, 2009 revealed a variety of activity, including drying grain on the concrete, the presence of cylindrical storage tanks and the arrival/departure of multiple support vehicles and personnel. A second failed satellite launch attempt apparently occurred in 2006.|$|E
50|$|Immediately {{after the}} war, the US Navy took {{possession}} of the island and began a joint project with Johns Hopkins University known as Operation Bumblebee which was an early guided missile development program. Over 200 missiles were test fired. The <b>missile</b> <b>assembly</b> building {{is located on the}} sound at Channel Blvd. and Flake Ave. in the Topsail Beach business district which is now used as a museum and meeting center. The launch pad is used as a patio for the Jolly Roger Motel. Several missile tracking towers still stand along the island. The testing ended in 1948 and the island was returned to the original owners. The roads, bridge, and other infrastructure were left intact and development of the island as a beach resort began in the 1950s. A developer built a brick model home for a planned development in 1952 but in 1954 the storm surge from Hurricane Hazel completely flooded the Topsail Island washing away most structures. The model home survived the storm with minor damage, however the design was abandoned in favor of homes built on pilings. The model home still stands at the corner of Scott Ave. and Anderson boulevard in Topsail Beach.|$|E
