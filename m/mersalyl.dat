40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{elucidate}} the cellular mechanism by which the mercurial diuretic <b>mersalyl</b> stimulates renin secretion in rabbit renal cortical slices in vitro. The stimu-latory effect of <b>mersalyl</b> on renin secretion was rapid, reversible and concentration dependent. The stimulation was not depend-ent on the presence of ions such as Na, Cl and Ca, and it was unaffected by inhibitors of Na/K/ 2 Cl cotransport, such as bumetanide and furosemide. However, the stimulation was blocked and reversed by thiols, such as L-cysteine and dithio-threitol. Furthermore, the maximal stimulatory effect of <b>mersalyl</b> on renin secretion was not additive to that produced by the non-diuretic mercurial sulfhydryl reagent P-chloromercuriphenylsul-fonate nor to that produced by the non-mercurial diuretic sulfhy-dryl reagent, ethacrynic acid.

No effect was observed if intraperitoneal treatment was delayed 1 or 2 h postinfection, or if treatment was administered either subcutaneously or per os. Topical treatment with a 5 % aqueous solution of <b>mersalyl</b> produced a statistically significant effect against herpes simplex dermatitis in mice but the substance was inactive against systemic infections in mice with herpes simplex as well as Columbia SK, influenza, Semliki Forest, and Sendai viruses. Contact inactivation of coxsackieviruses A 21 and B 1 and herpes simplex virus was observed, but <b>mersalyl</b> was inactive in tissue culture against coxackieviruses A 21 and B 1, herpes simplex, influenza, rhinovirus, Semliki Forest, Sendai, and vaccinia viruses...|$|E
40|$|Effect of <b>mersalyl</b> on {{the thick}} {{ascending}} limb of Henle's loop. The cortical {{portion of the}} thick ascending limb of Henle's loop was dissected from rabbit kidneys and perfused in vitro. There was active chloride transport resulting in net sodium chloride reabsorption from the tubule lumen, with the electrical potential difference (PD) oriented positive in the lumen. The addition of <b>mersalyl</b> (≧ 10 - 5 M) to the lumen caused the PD and net Cl flux to decrease, indicating inhibition of the active Cl transport. The decrease in PD caused by the drug in the lumen was approximately 50 % at concentrations {{equal to or greater}} than 10 - 5 M, and the decrease in Cl transport (measured at 3 × 10 - 5 M) was similar in magnitude. Addition of p-chloromercuribenzoate to the tubule lumen immediately reversed the effect of <b>mersalyl</b> administration. The diuresis caused by mercurials in vivo similarly is reversed by p-chloromercuribenzoate administration. Therefore, the effect of <b>mersalyl</b> on the isolated perfused thick ascending limbs of Henle's loop in vitro can be identified with its diuretic effect in vivo. <b>Mersalyl</b> in the bath was inactive except at a higher concentration (10 - 4 M), and the effect was not reversible. We conclude that the diuretic effect of mercurials is due, at least in part, to inhibition by these drugs in the tubule lumen of active Cl transport in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop...|$|E
40|$|In {{media at}} pH 7. 4 the {{uncoupling}} activity on oxidative phosphorylation with sodium succinate (5 mM) as substrate was studied in liver mitochondria for many antiinflammatory drugs (e. g. ibuprofen, 0. 25 mM; flufenamic acid, 0. 20 mM; pyrazinobutazone, 0. 25 mM; indomethacin, 0. 20 mM; and methiazinic acid, 1 mM). <b>Mersalyl</b> (0. 035 mM) does not inhibit the respiration induced by 2, 4 dinitrophenol, but inhibits respiration induced by all these drugs. This inhibition was not reversed by 2, 4 dinitrophenol (20 μM), Janus Green B (50 μM) {{or any other}} uncoupling agents in media with or without phosphate. This proved that this action is independent of the ability of <b>Mersalyl</b> to prevent phosphate penetration into mitochondria. Meanwhile, cysteine (0. 15 mM) was able to reverse the inhibition of <b>Mersalyl</b> in media {{with as well as}} without phosphate and restored the uncoupling activity of the anti inflammatory drugs. This competition between cysteine and <b>Mersalyl</b> is 'dose dependent'. A similar action of <b>Mersalyl</b> and cysteine was also observed on the uncoupling activity of valinomycin (0. 2 μg). The results suggest that acidic anti inflammatory drugs and valinomycin exert their uncoupling activity by way of fixation on membrane sites rich in sulfhydryl groups. The sites might be similar for the two kinds of drugs. There is a slight inhibition of the uncoupling activity of valinomycin and acidic anti inflammatory drugs observed with nupercaine (0. 6 mM).

40|$|The {{effects of}} thiol-specific {{reagents}} on the amplitude of the electro-olfactogram (E. O. G.) responses elicited from frog olfactory mucosa by pulses of odorant vapours was studied. The impermeant thiol-specific reagent <b>mersalyl</b> [(3 -{[2 -(carboxymethoxy) -benzoyl]amino}- 2 -methoxypropyl) hydroxymercury monosodium salt] brings about a rapid {{decrease in the}} E. O. G. signal obtained with the odorant pentyl acetate. The extent of the decrease {{is proportional to the}} concentration of the <b>mersalyl</b> applied and the effect of the reagent is partially but incompletely reversed by treatment of the labelled mucosa with dithiothreitol. The sites labelled by <b>mersalyl</b> can be protected by pretreating the mucosa with a dilute solution of the odorant pentyl acetate and leaving the solution in contact with the tissue after the addition of <b>mersalyl.</b> When the protecting odorant is washed out of the tissue, the original E. O. G. amplitude is regained. Pentyl acetate applied to the mucosa protected the E. O. G. response to vapour pulses of the following odorants from the effects of mersalyl: n-butyric acid, n-butyl acetate, phenylacetaldehyde and cineole (1, 3, 3 -trimethyl- 2 -oxabicyclo[2. 2. 2]octane). The pentyl acetate applied to the mucosa failed to protect the E. O. G. response to vapour pulses of the following odorants from the effects of mersalyl: butan- 1 -ol, benzyl acetate, nitrobenzene, β-ionone and linalyl acetate. The significance of the differential protection effects for the odour-quality-coding mechanism in the olfactory primary neurons is discussed. It is suggested that the olfactory code at this level of the olfactory system may be elucidated by chemical-modification methods...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{content of}} {{mitochondrial}} membrane protein thiol groups accessible to react with the monofunctional thiol reagents <b>mersalyl</b> or N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) was determined using Ellman's reagent. Deenergized mitochondria incubated {{in the presence}} of Ca 2 + (0 – 500 μM) undergo a very significant decrease in the content of membrane protein thiols accessible to NEM, and an increase in the content of thiols accessible to <b>mersalyl.</b> This process is time-dependent and inhibited by Mg 2 +, ruthenium red and ADP, but not by cyclosporin A. This suggests that Ca 2 + binding to the inner mitochondrial membrane promotes extensive alterations in the conformation of membrane proteins that result in location changes of thiol groups. The relationship between these alterations and mitochondrial membrane permeability transition was studied through the effect of NEM and <b>mersalyl</b> on mitochondrial swelling induced by Ca 2 + plus t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-bOOH) or Ca 2 + plus the thiol cross-linkers 4, 4 ′-diisothiocyanatostilbene- 2, 2 ′-disulfonic acid (DIDS) or phenylarsine oxide (PhAsO). We observed that the hydrophobic thiol reagent NEM inhibits the effects of t-bOOH, DIDS and PhAsO, while the hydrophilic thiol reagent <b>mersalyl</b> inhibits only the effect of DIDS. Permeability transition in all the situations studied is accompanied by a significant decrease in the total membrane protein thiol content. In addition, mitochondrial membrane permeabilization induced by PhAsO is inhibited by EGTA, but not by ruthenium red. This result suggests that PhAsO leads to permeability transition through a mechanism independent of intramitochondrial Ca 2 +-induced alterations of thiol group reactivity, but dependent on Ca 2 + binding to an extramitochondrial site. This site is sensitive to extramitochondrial Ca 2 + concentrations in range of 1 – 50 μM...|$|E

40|$|Mitochondria {{from some}} plant tissues possess {{the ability to}} take up Ca 2 + by a phosphate-dependent {{mechanism}} associated with a decrease in membrane potential, H+ extrusion, and increase in the rate of respiration (AE Vercesi, L Pereira da Silva, IS Martins, CF Bernardes, EGS Carnieri, MM Fagian [1989] In G Fiskum, ed, Cell Calcium Metabolism. Plenum Press, New York, pp 103 - 111). The present study reexamined the nature of the phosphate requirement in this process. The main observations are: (a) Respiration-coupled Ca 2 + uptake by isolated corn (Zea mays var Maya Normal) mitochondria or carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone-induced efflux of the cation from such mitochondria are sensitive to <b>mersalyl</b> and cannot be dissociated from the silmultaneous movement of phosphate in the same direction. (b) Ruthenium red-induced efflux is not affected by <b>mersalyl</b> and can occur in the absence of phosphate movement. (c) In Ca 2 +-loaded corn mitochondria, <b>mersalyl</b> causes net Ca 2 + release unrelated to a decrease in membrane potential, probably due to an inhibition of Ca 2 + cycling {{at the level of the}} influx pathway. It is concluded that corn mitochondria (and probably other plant mitochondria) do possess an electrophoretic influx pathway that appears to be a mersalyl-sensitive Ca 2 +/inorganic phosphate-symporter and a phosphate-independent efflux pathway possibly similar to the Na 2 +-independent Ca 2 + efflux mechanism of vertebrate mitochondria, because it is not stimulated by Na+...|$|E

Incubation of intestinal cytosol preparations in buffer containing 50 mM Tris. HCl, 300 mM KCl, and 1. 5 mM EDTA, pH 7. 4, with 1 mM <b>mersalyl</b> for 60 min was effective in inhibiting 98 % of 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 specific binding activity. Dissociation of bound 1, 25 -(OH) 2 [26, 27 - 3 H]D 3 from the hormone-receptor complex approached completion by 180 min. In cytosol incubated with saturating levels of nonradioactive hormone, 96 % of total binding activity was measurable with the hormone binding assay after displacement of bound nonradioactive ligand with 1 mM <b>mersalyl.</b> Endogenously occupied 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 binding sites contributed 0, 9, and 19 % of total binding activity in rats with plasma 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 levels averaging 2, 121 +/- 36 and 516 +/- 92 pg/ml, respectively. Therefore, the major fraction of cytosolic 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 specific binding activity is unoccupied in rat intestine.

ATP synthesis was sensitive to the electron transport inhibitor KCN, the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, and the coupling factor inhibitor oligomycin. Experiments with the adenine nucleotide translocator inhibitor atractyloside indicated the SMP were inside-out. <b>Mersalyl</b> completely inhibited ATP synthesis by SMP, and a separate experiment indicated that <b>mersalyl</b> has a direct effect on the ATPase complex. The kinetics of ATP synthesis indicated a high affinity for phosphate (Km = 0. 18 millimolar). ADP kinetics gave a biphasic curve with Km values of about 4. 8 and 160 micromolar. O 2 uptake and ATP synthesis had a pH maximum of 7. 6 while the ratio of micromoles phosphate esterified to microatoms O 2 taken up was highest at pH 7. 2.

40|$|Respiring rat heart {{mitochondria}} {{were loaded}} with Ca 2 + and then treated with Ruthenium Red. The factors affecting the subsequent Ca 2 +-efflux were studied. Addition of rotenone or antimycin {{led to a}} decline of efflux except at pH values above 7. 2, provided the load was less than about 80 nmol per mg of protein. Oligomycin reversed {{the effect of the}} respiratory inhibitors. Independently of respiration, efflux was stimulated by the uncoupler trifluoromethyltetrachlorbenzimadazole, by <b>mersalyl</b> and by thyroid hormones. The stimulated efflux could be diminished by ADP, with Mg 2 + as cofactor if efflux was rapid. With respiration in progress, efflux could be stimulated by N-ethylmaleimide and 5, 5 '-dithiobis-(2 -nitrobenzoate). The effects of <b>mersalyl</b> and of thyroid hormones could be diminished with dithiothreitol. In the absence of stimulating agents, the Ca 2 + efflux was proportional to the load up to some critical amount, this critical amount was decreased by the agents. Thyroxine and <b>mersalyl</b> caused not only loss of Ca 2 +, but also simultaneous, but not necessarily proportional, loss of internal adenine nucleotides. Both efflux rates were kept at a low value by bongkrekic acid added before the stimulating agent. It is concluded that Ca 2 + efflux is a measure of a permeability controlled by the binding of ADP (an Mg 2 +) to the inner membrane, and that this in turn depends on the maintenance of certain thiol gropus in a reduced form by a reaction that uses NADH and ATP and the energy-linked transhydrogenase...|$|E

40|$|Addition of Ruthenium Red to {{energized}} rat liver mitochondria {{that have}} previously accumulated Ca 2 + and phosphate from the external medium induces a parallel efflux of both these ions. <b>Mersalyl</b> or dithioerythritol, which decrease Ruthenium Red-insensitive Ca 2 + efflux, also decrease phosphate efflux {{to the same}} extent. Conversely diazenedicarboxylic acid bis(NN-dimethylamide) (DDBA), which increases the Ruthenium Red-induced Ca 2 + efflux concurrently increases phosphate release. Dithioerythritol and DDBA, reducing and oxidizing agents of thiol groups respectively, modify Ca 2 + and Pi efflux without penetrating the mitochondrial inner membrane. Under all the adopted conditions the membrane potential is preserved. The release of resting respiration and the parallel efflux of Mg 2 + and adenine nucleotides, events closely correlated to Ca 2 + cycling, are equally prevented either by <b>mersalyl,</b> which inhibits phosphate transport, or dithioerythritol; DDBA has the opposite effect.

The concentration of calcium was higher in the upper side and the concentration of potassium and phosphorus was higher in the lower side of the hypocotyls placed in horizontal position. This differential distribution was correlated with the curvature. The re{{distribution of}} ions is not connected to geotropic perception since 0. 5 hour horizontal orientation at 25 C and subsequent exposure at 4 C did not result in any redistribution. No differential distribution was observed in the hypocotyls placed in horizontal position when curvature was stopped by pre-treatment with NPA. After unilateral IAA application (0. 1 % W/W in lanolin) the concentration of calcium was higher in the concave side whereas the concentration of potassium and phosphorus was higher in the convex side. IAA probably affects the ion pumps via differential growth which results in redistribution of ions. In unilaterally illuminated coleoptiles illuminated (concave) side showed higher concentration of calcium, whereas shaded (convex) side showed higher concentration of potassium and phosphorus. NPA inhibited phototropic curvature as a result no differential distribution of ion was observed. Unilateral application of <b>mersalyl</b> (10 - 4 M in hydrated lanolin) resulted some movement of calcium away from the donor side and movement of potassium into the donor side. <b>Mersalyl</b> affects the distribution of ions by altering ion pumps and its mechanism of ion pump operation must be different from that of IAA as <b>mersalyl</b> does not produce a differential growth response and the IAA effect is dependent on differential growth. Hence, the results show a correlation between differential distribution of ions and curvature. It is concluded, therefore, that differential distribution is probably caused by curvature. <p...|$|E

In the absence of added ADP, inorganic phosphate increased malate oxidation rates by processes inhibited by <b>mersalyl</b> and oligomycin, but phosphate did not stimulate uncoupled respiration. However, the uncoupled oxidation rates were inhibited by butylmalonate and <b>mersalyl.</b> When uncoupler was added prior to substrate, subsequent O 2 uptake rates were reduced when malate and succinate, but not exogenous NADH, were used. Uncoupler and butylmalonate also inhibited swelling in malate solutions and malate accumulation by these mitochondria, which {{were found to have}} a high endogenous phosphate content. Addition of uncoupler after malate or succinate produced an initial rapid oxidation which declined as the mitochondria lost solute and contracted. This decline was not affected by addition of ADP or AMP, and was not observed when exogenous NADH was substrate. Increasing K+ permeability with valinomycin increased the P-trifluoromethoxy (carboxylcyanide) phenyl hydrazone inhibition.

Transport was also strongly blocked (> 80 %) by 1 mM of either 3, 5 -diiodosalicylic acid, MK- 473 (an indanyloxyacetate derivative), or diphenylamine- 2 -carboxylate, and by 0. 4 mM pentachlorophenol, but not by 1 mM ethacrynic acid, furosemide, or the disulfonic stilbenes SITS or H~DIDS. One-way [14 C]Lac efflux from steady-state cells amounted to ~ 6 meq/liter-min and was likewise affected by the agents listed above. Influx, which was membrane potential insensitive and Na + independent, displayed a strong pH dependence: extracellular acidification enhanced uptake while alkalinization inhibited the process (pK ' ~ 5. 7 at 2 mM external Lac). The rate of [14 C]Lac influx was a saturable function of external Lac, the Km being ~ 7 raM.

Passive swelling experiments indicated that corn mitochondria can accumulate several other anions by proton symport, but only isocitrate {{is taken up}} nearly as effectively as citrate. At the optimal pH (4. 5), active uptake of carrier-free [14 C]citrate in 50 micromolar <b>mersalyl</b> is inhibited by fourteen anions, but only the I 50 (the concentration of inhibitor required to reduce uptake of carrier-free [14 C]citrate by 50 %) values of citrate (0. 08 millimolar) and d-and l-isocitrate (0. 5 millimolar) are less than 4 millimolar.

However no [14 C]glutamine was detected in the matrix space, even with 10 mM [14 C]glutamine as substrate or with inhibition of glutamine deamidation (low temperature, p-chloromercuribenzoate, <b>mersalyl).</b> These results suggest that glutamine crosses the inner membrane by a carrier-mediated step and that this step is rate-limiting in glutamine deamidation...|$|E
40|$|Uptake of {{arsenite}} by rat liver mitochondria is energy-dependent, {{as shown}} by comparing values without and with either uncoupling agent or respiratory inhibitor present. The uptake is inhibited by <b>mersalyl</b> and N-ethylmaleimide, {{which can be used}} as 'stopping' agents to obtain uptake kinetics. At 20 degrees C the process is nearly complete in 1 min. The relation between the quantity in the energized mitochondria and the applied concentration corresponds to at least two different modes of binding of the arsenite. Competition occurs between arsenite and other anions (for example, phosphate) for intramitochondrial accumulation...|$|E
40|$|FAD synthase (FMN:ATP adenylyl transferase, FMNAT or FADS, EC 2. 7. 7. 2) is {{involved}} in the biochemical pathway for converting riboflavin into FAD. Human FADS exists in different isoforms. Two of these have been characterized and are localized in different subcellular compartments. hFADS 2 containing 490 amino acids shows a two domain organization: the 3 '-phosphoadenosine- 5 '-phosphosulfate (PAPS) reductase domain, that is the FAD-forming catalytic domain, and a resembling molybdopterin-binding (MPTb) domain. By a multialignment of hFADS 2 with other MPTb containing proteins of various organisms from bacteria to plants, the critical residues for hydrolytic function were identified. A homology model of the MPTb domain of hFADS 2 was built, using as template the solved structure of a T.  acidophilum enzyme. The capacity of hFADS 2 to catalyse FAD hydrolysis was revealed. The recombinant hFADS 2 was able to hydrolyse added FAD in a Co(2 +) and <b>mersalyl</b> dependent reaction. The recombinant PAPS reductase domain is not able to perform the same function. The mutant C 440 A catalyses the same hydrolytic function of WT with no essential requirement for <b>mersalyl,</b> thus indicating the involvement of C 440 in the control of hydrolysis switch. The enzyme C 440 A is also able to catalyse hydrolysis of FAD bound to the PAPS reductase domain, which is quantitatively converted into FMN...|$|E
40|$|The tricarboxylate {{transport}} system {{located in the}} inner mitochondrial membrane was studied as an isolated protein reconstituted in proteoliposomes. The effects on the transport of citrate by various reagents, specific for different aminoacid residues, were analyzed. In the group of SH reagents, {{it was found that}} N-ethylmaleimide is an irreversible inhibitor of the citrate-citrate exchange, while HgCl 2 and the mercurial <b>mersalyl</b> cause a rapid unidirectional efflux of citrate from liposomes. It was demonstrated that NEM and mercurials act on different SH groups. Dithioerythritol is not able to reverse the effect of <b>mersalyl</b> unless another reagent, pyridoxalphosphate, is present. Pyridoxalphosphate itself, a reagent specific for NH 2 residues, is an effective inhibitor of citrate exchange transport, as measured in both influx and efflux, but it has no effect on the mercurial-induced efflux. The same behavior was observed with diethylpyrocarbonate, a reagent specific for histidine and tyrosine residues. Interestingly, a slow basic efflux of internal citrate, in the absence of countersubstrate, was observed in proteoliposomes. Because it is inhibited by the same reagents acting on the exchange process, it is deduced that it is catalyzed by the tricarboxylate carrier. The ability of the carrier to perform a uniport of the substrate suggests the presence of a single substrate binding site on the carrier protein. A preliminary kinetic approach indicates that such a transport model is compatible with this theory...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAspartate, glutamate, serine and glycine all {{permeate}} the inner membrane of mitochondria isolated from both etiolated and green plant tissues. No {{significant difference was}} found in the transport characteristics shown by mitochondria from either tissue. Influx of each amino acid appears diffusional because substrate saturation was not observed and there was no indication of specific inhibition or a requirement for a compensatory or counter ion for uptake. In contrast, uptake of the keto acid pyruvate did appear saturable. Inhibition by α-cyano- 4 -hydroxycinnamate, <b>mersalyl</b> and FCCP, but not valinomycin, suggests a carrier and a ΔpH mediate pyruvate transport into the matrix...|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of sulphate uptake catalysed by the dicarboxylate carrier were measured. The Km {{value for}} sulphate is about 0. 3 mM. A completely competitive relation {{exists between the}} influxes of sulphate and malonate, whereas the relation between sulphate and phosphate is of the mixed type. The inhibition of sulphate influx by <b>mersalyl</b> and bathophenanthroline {{is similar to that}} of malonate influx and different from the inhibition of phosphate influx. It is considered that sulphate and malonate probably bind to the same locus on the carrier, whereas phosphate occupies a different site. The possible implications of this conclusion are discussed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the properties {{and a possible}} biological role of a transport process across the inner membrane of rat liver mitochondria resulting in the exchange of ATP 4 - (out) for ADP 3 - (in) + 0. 5 phosphate 2 - (in). This transmembrane exchange reaction, designated as the ATP-ADP-phosphate exchange, is specific for the ligands shown, electroneutral, insensitive to N-ethylmaleimide or <b>mersalyl,</b> inhibited by atractyloside, and appears to occur only in the direction as written. It is thus distinct from the well-known phosphate-hydroxide and phosphate-dicarboxylate exchange systems, which are inhibited by <b>mersalyl,</b> and from the ATP-ADP exchanger, which does not transport phosphate. During ATP hydrolysis by mitochondria, half of the phosphate formed from ATP passes from the matrix to the medium by the mersalyl-insensitive ATP-ADP-phosphate exchange {{and the other half}} by the well-known mersalyl-sensitive phosphate-hydroxide exchange. These and other considerations have led to a hypothesis for the pathway and stoichiometry of ATP-dependent reverse electron transport, characterized by a requirement of 1. 33 molecules of ATP per pair of electrons reversed and by the utilization of a different membrane transport pathway for phosphate and adenine nucleotides than is taken in forward electron flow and oxidative phosphorylation. The possible occurrence of independent pathways for ATP-forming forward electron flow and ATP-consuming reverse electron flow is consonant {{with the fact that the}} opposing degradative and synthetic pathways in the central routes of cell metabolism generally have different pathways that are independently regulated...|$|E
40|$|Acidification of the {{suspending}} {{medium of}} corn mitochondria (Zea mays L., WF 9 × Mo 17) from pH 7. 5 to pH 6. 8 to 6. 4 initiates osmotic swelling with the transportable anions citrate, sulfate, and phosphate. Swelling becomes pronounced {{with a combination}} of citrate plus sulfate or phosphate. Acidification proves to activate endogenous respiration, which is essentially zero at pH 7. 5. The endogenous respiration transports citrate (in the presence of sulfate or phosphate) which then contributes to respiration and the accelerated osmotic swelling. <b>Mersalyl</b> will inhibit the swelling and antimycin inhibits the endogenous respiration. Magnesium appears to reduce the permeability of the membranes under the acid conditions...|$|E
