5|$|Despite {{statements}} from bandmembers, that Lamb of God planned {{to enter the}} studio in 2014 to begin recording their eighth studio album, hoping to complete it {{by the end of}} the same year, Chris Adler said in an interview with The Virginian-Pilot that besides the large amount legal fees the band encountered from Randy Blythe's trial, the band's inactivity during the trial <b>meant</b> <b>no</b> new income coming in, which eventually depleted the band's funds.|$|E
5|$|The {{move by the}} Rus' {{army was}} {{detected}} by the Mongols, {{who were on the}} east side of the Dnieper River waiting for reinforcements from Jochi, Genghis Khan's eldest son, who was campaigning around the Aral Sea. Jochi, however, had become ill, which <b>meant</b> <b>no</b> reinforcements would be coming.|$|E
5|$|In January 1909, Austro-Hungarian admirals {{circulated}} {{a document}} {{calling for a}} fleet of four dreadnoughts. A constitutional crisis in 1909–10 <b>meant</b> <b>no</b> construction could be approved. In spite of this, two dreadnoughts were laid down by shipyards on a speculative basis – due especially to the energetic manipulations of Rudolf Montecuccoli, Chief of the Austro-Hungarian Navy – and later approved along with an additional two. The resulting ships, all , were {{to be accompanied by}} a further four ships, but these were cancelled on the outbreak of World War I.|$|E

5|$|In San Antonio de Béxar, Ugartechea asked Dr. Launcelot Smither, a Gonzales {{resident}} in town on personal business, to help Castañeda convince the settlers to follow orders. When Smither arrived on October 1, {{he met with}} militia captain Mathew Caldwell to explain that the soldiers <b>meant</b> <b>no</b> harm if the settlers would peacefully relinquish the cannon. Caldwell instructed Smither to bring Castañeda to the town the following morning to discuss the matter. At roughly the same time, Moore called a war council, which quickly voted to initiate a fight. It is unclear whether the war council was aware that Caldwell had promised Castañeda safe passage to Gonzales the next morning.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, most of {{the women}} and {{children}} had gathered in the sacristy of the church. As Mexican soldiers entered the room, a boy, thought to be the son of defender Anthony Wolf, stood up to rearrange a blanket around his shoulders. Mistaking him for a Texian soldier, the Mexican soldiers bayoneted him. In the confusion, {{at least one of the}} women was lightly wounded. Bowie's family, including Gertrudis Navarro, Juana Navarro Alsbury and her son, were hiding in one of the rooms along the west wall. Navarro opened the door to their room to signal that they <b>meant</b> <b>no</b> harm. A Mexican officer soon arrived and led the women to a spot along one of the walls where they would be relatively safe. All of the women and children were eventually placed under the protection of an officer and escorted out of the Alamo and imprisoned in the home of the Musquiz family.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Halloween, Yablans and Akkad began working on Halloween II. There was initial {{discussion}} about filming Halloween II in 3-D, but the idea never came to fruition. After Halloween II was released, Carpenter and Hill were approached about creating a third Halloween film, but they were reluctant to pledge commitment. The pair {{agreed to participate in}} the new project only if it was not a direct sequel to Halloween II, which <b>meant</b> <b>no</b> Michael Myers. Most of the filming for Halloween III took place on location in the small coastal town of Loleta in Humboldt County, California. Familiar Foods, a milk bottling plant in Loleta, served as the Silver Shamrock Novelties factory, but all special effects involving fire, smoke, and explosions were filmed at Post Studios.|$|E

5|$|In 1978, the Astronomy Department of Case Western Reserve University made a {{deal with}} the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) to build a new {{observatory}} at Kitt Peak National Observatory to house the Burrell Schmidt. The telescope was moved from Ohio to Arizona in May 1979, and in 1980 the 36-inch reflector on Taylor Road was moved to the Nassau Station. This <b>meant</b> <b>no</b> further astronomical work was done at the Taylor Road facility, and as a result the faculty and resources of the original observatory were moved to the main campus of Case Western Reserve University in 1982. The Taylor Road facility was sold in 1983, was abandoned, and remained neglected until 2005 when it was sold to a couple who planned to convert the building into a residence. The plans stalled when its new owner was convicted of mortgage fraud and sent to prison in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Lyon later {{apologized to}} the House as a whole, {{claiming}} he had not known it was in session when he confronted Griswold, and <b>meant</b> <b>no</b> breach of decorum or disrespect to the body; he also provided a written letter of apology. Not satisfied with the apology, on February 15, 1798, Griswold retaliated by attacking Lyon with a wooden cane, beating him about the head and shoulders in view of other representatives on the House floor. Lyon retreated to a fire pit and defended himself with the tongs until other Congressmen broke up the fight, with several pulling Griswold by his legs {{to get him to}} let go of Lyon. Although the committee appointed to investigate recommended censure of both Lyon and Griswold, the House as a whole rejected the motion. The issue was resolved when both Lyon and Griswold promised the House that they would keep the peace and remain on good behavior.|$|E

25|$|Eden skated a {{world record}} in 10,000m. With 19:12.4, he was half a minute ahead of the others. In the third {{distance}}, he lost to Einar Halvorsen, which <b>meant</b> <b>no</b> world champion. Eden failed to finish the final distance after a fall.|$|E
25|$|A {{national}} contest resumed in 1941; Cercle {{finished the}} season last but {{one in the}} league. Usually this would have meant relegation, but the KBVB ruled that {{the circumstances of the}} war, which limited training opportunities and youth development, <b>meant</b> <b>no</b> team should be relegated.|$|E
25|$|The tramway {{resurfacing}} works {{and construction of}} a tram shed at Starr Gate <b>meant</b> <b>no</b> trams operated south of the Pleasure Beach from 2009 until the new trams entered service in April 2012 and track work at Cleveleys halted services north of Little Bispham. A replacement bus service operated.|$|E
50|$|Geneva Glenwoods. Based in Geneva, New York; oddly, {{this team}} {{had a home}} field that had no goal posts, which <b>meant</b> that <b>no</b> field goals could be attempted.|$|R

25|$|Rain <b>meant</b> <b>no</b> {{play was}} {{possible}} {{on the first}} day at Headingley. The second day was dominated by Ian Harvey, who, at close, was on a career-best 161 not out after being dropped by Andrew Caddick on 96. Yorkshire were on 401 for 7. Matthew Wood had added 95 in 174 balls earlier in the day.|$|E
25|$|This {{was meant}} as a {{preparation}} for re-introducing their previous unsuccessful reform abolishing Chinese characters. Although the postwar timing <b>meant</b> <b>no</b> public debate was held {{on the future of}} the Japanese written language, the defenders of the original kanji system considered and accepted the tōyō kanji as a reasonable compromise. Since this compromise could not then be withdrawn in favour of more radical reform, discussion of kanji abolition ended. Thirty-five years passed before further reforms were brought to the Japanese written form.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{most other}} areas of India, British rule <b>meant</b> <b>no</b> major {{upsetting}} of the community's traditional social system, although the traditional peasant landowning class, the Banias and Patidars, were absorbed into the Jain business community. The British {{did not have a}} financing vacuum to fill in the city, so their presence was limited to administrative and military spheres. Unlike other Indian cities, Ahmedabad lacked a comprador class or dominant, Western-educated middle class. Western education was slower to be introduced into the city than in most other Indian cities. There was very little English higher education available in the city and no English-language newspapers there in the 19th century.|$|E

25|$|In {{the period}} between {{formation}} of the Caledonian Railway {{and the opening of}} the main line, a large number of leases and working arrangements had been concluded with other railways being promoted or built. This was mostly done by guaranteeing those shareholders an income on their capital, which <b>meant</b> <b>no</b> immediate cash was required. When the lines started working, suddenly a huge periodical payment was required, and the income was inadequate to satisfy it. There were also suggestions of improper share acquisitions, and in the period 1848 to 1850 a number of shareholder inquiries disclosed bad practices, and many board members had to resign in February 1850.|$|E
25|$|That <b>meant</b> <b>no</b> {{interchangeable}} {{lines as}} in troubadour poetry and fewer repetitions: for a French jongleur who sang his poems these were necessary, but they sounded redundant to the Sicilian authors. Their poetry was {{music to the}} eye, not to the ear, and their legacy is also apparent in Dante and Petrarch's lyrics. The sonnet is even more exacting on this point: the separation between the octave and the sestet is purely a logical one, the rimes drawing a visual line {{between the first and}} last part. However, the fact that Italian poetry was being made for the reading public may have facilitated its circulation.|$|E
25|$|Cromwell's {{treatment}} of Kilkenny and Clonmel {{is in contrast}} to that of Drogheda and Wexford. Despite the fact that his troops had suffered heavy casualties attacking the former two, Cromwell respected surrender terms which guaranteed the lives and property of the townspeople and the evacuation of armed Irish troops who were defending them. The change in attitude {{on the part of the}} Parliamentarian commander may have been a recognition that excessive cruelty was prolonging Irish resistance. However, in the case of Drogheda and Wexford no surrender agreement had been negotiated, and by the rules of continental siege warfare prevalent in the mid-17th century, this <b>meant</b> <b>no</b> quarter would be given; thus it can be argued that Cromwell's attitude had not changed.|$|E
