5|$|There {{was a scene}} were I {{was lying}} on the ground, {{appearing}} to be dead, in a Lodger-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it… the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere… the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on <b>me,</b> <b>right)</b> 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.'

500|$|In May 1948, Rodgers {{received}} {{a telephone call}} from Edwin Lester of the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera. [...] Lester had signed former Metropolitan Opera star Ezio Pinza for $25,000 to star in a new show, Mr. Ambassador. [...] The show had not been written, and it never would be. [...] Lester hoped that Rodgers would take over Pinza's contract. [...] Pinza had become bored as the Met's leading lyric bass, and having played the great opera houses, sought other worlds to conquer. [...] Rodgers immediately saw Pinza as perfect for the role of Emile. [...] Lester carefully broached the subject to Pinza and his wife/business manager and provided them with a copy of Tales of the South Pacific. [...] When Pinza read the book, he told Lester, [...] "Sell <b>me</b> <b>right</b> away!" [...] Pinza's contract for South Pacific included a clause limiting his singing to 15 minutes per performance. [...] With Pinza's signing, Rodgers and Hammerstein decided to make his the lead male role, subordinating the story of the pair of young lovers. [...] It was unusual on Broadway for the romantic lead to be an older male.|$|E
500|$|After parting {{ways with}} RCA, Smith moved to Columbia Records in 1973. With her new contract, {{she insisted that}} {{she would be able to}} record one gospel album a year. She {{released}} her first gospel album under the label in November 1973, entitled God Is Abundant. In addition, the label also gave her the advantage of being able to incorporate more gospel songs into her regular country studio albums. Because of these factors, most of her singles remained out of the top ten, but she did manage to stay in the top 20 most of the decade. That year Smith recorded her first country album for the label entitled A Lady Named Smith with producer George Richey. Smith and Richey co-wrote the album's lead single, [...] "You've Got <b>Me</b> (<b>Right</b> Where You Want Me)", which became a minor hit on the Billboard country chart. However Smith was dissatisfied with Richey's production strategies and replaced him with Ray Baker for her next album, That's the Way Love Goes (1974). Her next single (released on That's the Way Love Goes) was written by Dallas Frazier called [...] "Ain't Love a Good Thing", which peaked at No.10 on the Hot Country Singles Chart in 1974.|$|E
500|$|By May 1999, {{the group}} was nearing {{platinum}} status for Dude Ranch and sales targets were higher for Enema of the State. The Los Angeles Times ran a Sunday feature on the band two days prior to release, noting that [...] "The musicians are sanguine about chances to repeat or exceed the sales of Dude Ranch, noting the always-shifting sands of pop culture and that they've already done better than they'd ever anticipated." [...] Momentum began to build when US radio stations received advance copies of Enema of the State. MCA issued Enema of the State on June 1, and the release peaked at number nine on the U.S. Billboard 200. The album chart was gripped by the Backstreet Boys' Millennium, but Enema of the State still managed to move 109,000 units that week. The band was supporting Lagwagon in Europe when MCA executives phoned the trio about rising record sales. Joey Cape, frontman of Lagwagon, remarked that [...] "They were selling, like, 90,000 records a day [...] I was saying things like, 'What are you doing here? Go home! Why {{do you want to}} be on tour with Lagwagon right now?" [...] At a show shortly following the release of the album, DeLonge was approached by Noodles from The Offspring to congratulate him. [...] "He looks at <b>me</b> <b>right</b> in the eyes and he goes, 'You're next,'" [...] remembered DeLonge, who blushed and shook off the compliment.|$|E
