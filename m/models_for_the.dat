40|$|AbstractUsing {{discrete}} time process algebra {{with relative}} timing, a <b>model</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> I 2 C-bus is designed. The {{model of the}} I 2 C-bus {{is divided into three}} parts: a <b>model</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bus lines, a <b>model</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> master interfaces and a <b>model</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> slave interfaces. The model of the bus lines is based on a <b>model</b> <b>for</b> a wired-AND. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>models</b> of the interfaces, the approach is to start from a high level bus protocol and refine it step by step. First, a single master without timing constraints is considered. Then the model is adapted to deal with the timing constraints. Then also the restriction to a single master is relaxed. It turns out that <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> slave interfaces can be based on <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> master interfaces. The use of the model obtained is discussed and illustrated...|$|R

40|$|The {{attributable}} fraction (AF) {{is a widely}} used measure {{to assess the impact}} of an exposure on a disease.

In this paper, we derive doubly robust estimators <b>for</b> <b>the</b> AF.

5|$|A {{remake of}} the game, simply titled Ever 17, was {{developed}} for Xbox 360 by 5pb. in collaboration with Cyberfront. It was originally planned to be released on July 28, 2011, but was delayed to December 1, 2011. It was made available in both a standard edition and a limited edition, the latter including a 2-disc soundtrack. The remake was redone from the ground up, and includes new event graphics, re-recorded voices, new routes, and a new ending. It uses 3D <b>models</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> conversation scenes; this move from 2D to 3D was made as 3D character models were seen as easier to animate than 2D sprites, {{as they can be}} posed without the need to draw new poses manually.

5|$|Beagles {{were in the}} United States by the 1840s at the latest, but {{the first}} dogs were {{imported}} strictly for hunting and were of variable quality. Since Honeywood had only started breeding in the 1830s, it is unlikely these dogs were representative of the modern breed and the description of them as looking like straight-legged Dachshunds with weak heads has {{little resemblance to the}} standard. Serious attempts at establishing a quality bloodline began in the early 1870s when General Richard Rowett from Illinois imported some dogs from England and began breeding. Rowett's Beagles are believed to have formed the <b>models</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first American standard, drawn up by Rowett, L. H. Twadell, and Norman Ellmore in 1887. The beagle was accepted as a breed by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1885. In the 20th century the breed has spread worldwide.|$|E

5|$|Initially given a blue color scheme, the TIE fighter <b>models</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{first film}} were grey to better film against a bluescreen; TIE fighters in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983) shifted {{back to being}} a muted blue. Sound {{designer}} Ben Burtt created the distinctive TIE fighter sound effect by combining an elephant call with a car driving on wet pavement. Combat scenes between TIE fighters and the Millennium Falcon and Rebel Alliance X-wing fighters in Star Wars were meant to be reminiscent of World War II dogfight footage; editors used World War II air combat clips as placeholders while Industrial Light & Magic completed the movie's special effects. Darth Vader's distinct TIE advanced X1 in Star Wars was designed to make it instantly recognizable, and the TIE interceptors developed for Jedi were designed to look fast, deadly, and frightening.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether new {{elements}} will continue {{the pattern of the}} current periodic table as period 8, or require further adaptations or adjustments. Seaborg expected the eighth period to follow the previously established pattern exactly, so that it would include a two-element s-block for elements 119 and 120, a new g-block for the next 18 elements, and 30 additional elements continuing the current f-, d-, and p-blocks, culminating in element 168, the next noble gas. More recently, physicists such as Pekka Pyykkö have theorized that these additional elements do not follow the Madelung rule, which predicts how electron shells are filled and thus affects the appearance of the present periodic table. There are currently several competing theoretical <b>models</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> placement of the elements of atomic number {{less than or equal to}} 172.|$|E

5|$|One of Meddings' first tasks was {{to shoot}} stock {{footage of the}} Thunderbird {{machines}} and the series' main locations, Tracy Island and Creighton-Ward Mansion. The finished island model was a composite {{of more than a}} dozen smaller sets that could be detached from the whole and filmed separately. The architecture of the mansion was based on that of Stourhead House, located on the Stourhead Estate in Wiltshire. In the absence of head designer Reg Hill, who was serving as associate producer, Meddings was further tasked with designing the Thunderbird fleet and FAB 1. Scale <b>models</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> six main vehicles were built by a contractor, Master Models of Middlesex. Models and puppet sets combined, more than 200 versions of the Thunderbird machines were created for the series.|$|E
5|$|Potter {{either had}} no live <b>models</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> eastern {{chipmunk}} characters, or borrowed a pet chipmunk from a cousin. Initially, {{she may have}} been unsure of how to draw the chipmunks and chose to clothe them, then was forced to follow suit and clothe the two main players as well, while leaving the other squirrels in their natural state. Or, she may have clothed Timmy and Goody because they collect their nuts in sacks (an unnatural way for squirrels to behave) in imitation of a ruse she employed in Peter Rabbit when Peter only walks on his hind legs while wearing his blue jacket. When he loses his jacket, he reverts to being an animal and moves about on all fours. Because Timmy and Chippy were not drawn from nature, the two suggest stuffed animals in their lack of engaging facial expressions.|$|E

In 1915, H.D. and Aldington launched the Poets' Translation Series, pamphlets of translations from Greek and Latin classics. H.D. worked on the plays by Euripides, publishing in 1916 a translation of choruses from Iphigeneia at Aulis, in 1919 a translation of choruses from Iphigeneia at Aulis and Hippolytus, an adaptation of Hippolytus called Hippolytus Temporizes (1927), a translation of choruses from The Bacchae and Hecuba (1931), and Euripides' Ion (1937) a loose translation of Ion.|$|E
