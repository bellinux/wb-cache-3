40|$|<b>Multiphase</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> have smaller torque {{pulsations}} and {{are more}} reliable that their three-phase alternatives. However, standard electricity grids {{around the world are}} three-phase, so power inverter is needed to drive multiphase motors. Inverter is used not only to power the motor, but also to control the am­plitude and frequency of the produced voltage, thus controlling motor speed and torque. Multiphase systems with odd number of phases have been widely investigated; therefore, this paper focuses on a six-phase inverter with a single neutral symmetrical load. A novel asymmetrical space vector modulation scheme is proposed and evaluated using simulations in Matlab/Simulink. Simulation results are compared to other modulation schemes. The proposed method is suitable for generating near-sinusoidal output voltages; however, it might not be suited for driving motors with sinusoidally distributed stator windings. </p...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays {{the work}} is in {{progress}} to develop wheeled and caterpillar tractors with electromechanical transmission. Range of changes in transmission gear ratio while using propulsion <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> depends on mechanical characteristics of a tractor propulsion <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> which is equipped with electromechanical transmission. In case when the range is rather high then {{it is possible to}} minimize number of gearings in the tractor gearing box or exclude its usage at all. Type of the applied propulsion <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> and regulation method specify type of mechanical characteristics (characteristics family) of the propulsion <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> The paper considers a propulsion asynchronous <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> with frequency control. While using frequency control it is possible to regulate <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> revolutions by mutual changes in voltage and voltage frequency. There are various laws of mutual changes in voltage and frequency (regulation laws). Selection of a regulation law influences on type of mechanical characteristics of a propulsion <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> Application of any law can be admissible only for some specific range of voltage frequency otherwise it is possible to exceed some parameters (for example, admissible voltage in the winding of <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> stator). It is necessary to ensure the required moment within wide range for a tractor propulsion <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> In this case losses in the <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> must be minimal. Losses in the rotor of the propulsion asynchronous <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> are directly proportional to its sliding and its best propulsion and mechanical properties of a mobile machine will be ensured in the case when sliding is preserved at a constant value. According to these reasons selection of regulation laws has been carried out for operation of the propulsion asynchronous <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> with nominal sliding and mechanical characteristics at nominal sliding is conventionally called a nominal characteristics. The paper analyzes the possible laws of mutual application of voltage and voltage frequency and their application boundaries. A combination of laws for regulation of the propulsion asynchronous <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> has been selected in the paper. The combination ensures the widest operational range of the <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> with high moment value at nominal sliding and due account of limitations on application of every used regulation law. The following mechanical characteristics family has been constructed for the propulsion asynchronous <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> regulated in accordance with the proposed law: at nominal sliding, at critical sliding, at changeable sliding and without changes in voltage and frequency. </p...|$|R
