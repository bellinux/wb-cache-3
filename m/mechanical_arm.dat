Some ALBs carry an inflatable Y-class lifeboat or Y-boat for inshore work, launched by <b>mechanical</b> <b>arm.</b> There are six classes of ALB motor life boats, with speeds ranging from 17 to 25 knots. The RNLI's aim {{is to provide a}} 25-knot lifeboat to every all-weather crew, and has begun construction of an All-weather Lifeboat Centre (ALC) in Poole which, when complete, will save £3million a year. The RNLI took over the ALC in 2015 with the expectation of becoming fully operational in 2019, when six Shannon-class lifeboats a year will be built.|$|E

500|$|Hubble was {{designed}} to accommodate regular servicing and equipment upgrades while in orbit. [...] Instruments and limited life items were designed as orbital replacement units. [...] Five servicing missions (SM 1, 2, 3A, 3B, and 4) were flown by NASA space shuttles, the first in December 1993 and the last in May 2009. Servicing missions were delicate operations that began with maneuvering to intercept the telescope in orbit and carefully retrieving it with the shuttle's <b>mechanical</b> <b>arm.</b> The necessary work was then carried out in multiple tethered spacewalks {{over a period of}} four to five days. After a visual inspection of the telescope, astronauts conducted repairs, replaced failed or degraded components, upgraded equipment, and installed new instruments. Once work was completed, the telescope was redeployed, typically after boosting to a higher orbit to address the orbital decay caused by atmospheric drag.|$|E

The disadvantages become quite dramatic when there is an observable, two-way communication delay between the operator and the remotely controlled equipment.

50|$|Without the <b>mechanical</b> <b>arm,</b> the {{production}} of cars would be extremely difficult. This problem was first solved in 1962 when the first <b>mechanical</b> <b>arm</b> was used in a “General Motors” factory. Using this <b>mechanical</b> <b>arm,</b> also known as an industrial robot, engineers were able to achieve difficult welding tasks. In addition, the removal of die-castings was another important step in improving the abilities of a <b>mechanical</b> <b>arm.</b> With such technology, engineers were able to easily remove unneeded metal underneath mold cavities. Stemming off these uses, welding started to become increasingly popular for mechanical arms.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this paper, dynamic {{equations}} {{of motion}} of a 5 DoF robot manipulator including <b>mechanical</b> <b>arms</b> with revolute joints and their electrical actuators are considered. The application of integrator backstepping technique for trajectory tracking in presence of parameters of uncertainty and disturbance is studied. The advantage of this control technique is that it imposes the desired properties of stability by fixing the candidate Lyapunov functions initially, then by calculating the other functions in a recursive way. Simulation results are presented in order to evaluate the tracking performance and the global stability of the closed loop system. The validity and usefulness of the proposed technique for robot motion control when the system dynamics including both <b>mechanical</b> <b>arms</b> and electrical actuators become more complex is obtained from the results...|$|R
