However, four months later Carlucci sent a classified <b>memo</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same services to abandon the FX, and green-lighting the exporting of front-line fighters overseas.

The color version of Gotcha was not widely produced, with between 20 and 100 machines released, but is believed to be the first color arcade game ever made, released over a month before Wimbledon, a color Pong clone.|$|E

Three versions of SBR are discussed, as is a model of science as disruptive cultural practice.

25|$|Under the {{direction}} of Frederick Lindemann, an extensive series of {{studies were carried out}} by Derek Jackson at RAF Coltishall. Starting in September, aircraft with Mk. IV and Mk.

25|$|In {{the light}} of these potent signs of a great disturbance, the Criminal Investigation Department sent a <b>memo</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Colonial Secretary {{suggesting}} moving Maria back to York Hill to avoid further inciting Muslim anger.

Nonetheless, it cannot be said definitively that moving Maria out of the convent at such a late stage could have averted the riots.|$|E
25|$|Haig {{had long}} thought French petty, jealous, {{unbalanced}} ("like {{a bottle of}} soda water … incapable of thinking … and coming to a reasoned decision"), overly quick to meddle in party politics and easily manipulated by Henry Wilson.

Haig still thought Germany might collapse by November, although {{at the same time he}} was sending a <b>memo</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> War Office recommending that the BEF, now numbering 25 divisions, be equipped with the maximum number of heavy guns, ready for a huge decisive battle, 36 divisions strong in 1916.|$|E

According to the NIMH, the average 24-hour for Varna Province was between 60 and 85 l/m², while in neighboring Dobrich Province it was from 90 to 155 l/m². The average amount for the whole month of June is around 50-60 l/m². A single weather station in the north of Varna recorded values of 35 l/m² in a two-hour period between 6pm and 8pm on June 19. In the far northeastern parts of Bulgaria, rainfall rates reached 140–200mm/h. On June 20 the NIMH warned that further rains up to 20 l/m² could be expected throughout the weekend.|$|E
25|$|Tryon showed {{concern for}} the {{wellbeing}} of his men and the better ordering of the Navy. Before Raleigh had left England, thirty men had deserted from the ship, and more {{took the opportunity to}} escape from ships of the squadron at Montevideo. Tryon wrote a <b>memo</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Admiralty recommending that the penalties for desertion should be reduced, suggesting that a number of those deserting were of little use to the navy and should be let go, while others who were good seamen, but who had some urgent personal reason for absconding, were afraid to return later because of the severe penalties. He also instituted a programme of weighing his men and ensuring they got enough food, noting that if, as frequently happened on board ship, the men weighed less by the end of a tour than at the start, then likely their strength and fitness was reduced too. He instituted a 'dry canteen' on board to try to improve their diet.|$|E
25|$|Wilson {{attended}} {{the first ever}} General Staff Conference and Staff Ride at Camberley in January 1905. He continued to lobby for a General Staff to be set up, especially after the Dogger Bank incident of October 1904. Repington also campaigned publicly for this from May 1905, which helped prod Brodrick’s successor Arnold-Forster into action. He asked Wilson for his views – Wilson proposed a strong Chief of the General Staff {{who would be the}} Secretary of State for War’s sole adviser on matters of strategy, ironically the position which would be held by Wilson’s rival Robertson during the First World War. Despite pressure from Repington, Esher and Sir George Clarke, progress on the General Staff was very slow. In August Arnold-Forster issued a minute similar to Wilson’s of three months previous. Lyttelton (Chief of the General Staff), unaware of Wilson’s role, expressed support. In November Wilson released Arnold-Forster's <b>memo</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> press, claiming he had been ordered to do so; Arnold-Forster initially expressed “amazement” but then agreed that the leak had “done nothing but good”.|$|E

25|$|In August 2002 and March 2003, in its war on terror, the George W. Bush administration, through Jay S. Bybee, the Office of Legal Counsel, Department of Justice, issued {{what became}} known as the Torture Memos after being leaked in 2004. These legal {{opinions}} (including the 2002 Bybee memo) argued for a narrow definition of torture under US law. The first three were addressed to the CIA, which took them as authority to use the described enhanced interrogation techniques (more generally classified as torture) on detainees classified as enemy combatants. Five days before the March 2003 invasion of Iraq, John Yoo, the acting Office of Legal Counsel, issued a fourth <b>memo</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> General Counsel of DOD, concluding his legal opinion by saying that federal laws related to torture and other abuse did not apply to interrogations overseas. The legal opinions were withdrawn by Jack Goldsmith of the OLC in June 2004 but reaffirmed by the succeeding head of the OLC in December 2004. US government officials at various times said they did not believe waterboarding to be a form of torture.|$|E
25|$|Another highly {{classified}} U.S. {{study was}} conducted by the CIA's Office of Scientific Investigation (OS/I) {{in the latter half}} of 1952 in response to orders from the National Security Council (NSC). This study concluded UFOs were real physical objects of potential threat to national security. One OS/I <b>memo</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> CIA Director (DCI) in December read: the reports of incidents convince us that there is something going on that must have immediate attention... Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such a nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or any known types of aerial vehicles. The matter was considered so urgent that OS/I drafted a memorandum from the DCI to the NSC proposing that the NSC establish an investigation of UFOs as a priority project throughout the intelligence and the defense research and development community. It also urged the DCI to establish an external research project of top-level scientists, now known as the Robertson Panel to analyze the problem of UFOs. The OS/I investigation was called off after the Robertson Panel's negative conclusions in January 1953.|$|E

50|$|Based on the Justice Department analyses, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld later {{approved}} in 2003 {{the use of}} 24 classified interrogation techniques for use on detainees at Guantanamo Bay, which after use on one prisoner were withdrawn.

Senior administration officials have repeatedly denied that torture is being conducted in the detention camps at Guantanamo Bay.
