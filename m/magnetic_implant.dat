40|$|The major {{challenges}} in magnetic hyperthermia treatment (MHT) are the low heat generation of magnetic nanoparticles {{for cancer therapy}} and the avoidance of overheating via the temperature self-control characteristic at the ideal therapeutic range. Hence the aims of this PhD thesis are {{to develop a new}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>implant</b> material with high heat generation and temperature self-control capability, and to study their potential for safe MHT applications. In order to develop a ceramic <b>magnetic</b> <b>implant,</b> a series of highly crystalline Mg-ferrites nanoparticles were successfully prepared by an improved co-precipitation method. The structure and the magnetic properties of these nanoparticles were characterised and the results showed that the maximum SAR value is obtained for 10 ± 0. 5 nm particles. The 10 ± 0. 5 nm MgFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles show higher heat generation and faster temperature rise in comparison to the Fe 3 O 4 commercial suspension which demonstrates the potential of these nanoparticles for MHT. However, {{it was found that the}} maximum temperature rise and the overheating of MgFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles need to be controlled through adjusting the amplitude of the external magnetic field, thus providing the motivation for preparation of magnetic nanoparticles with self-controlled heating capability. In order to induce the self-controlled heating ability, (Mg,Ti) -ferrite nanoparticles were attained by substituting Ti 4 + ions into the Mg-ferrite. The magnetic properties of these nanoparticles were studied and it was found that the low saturation magnetization of these nanoparticles made undesirable their application as implants for effective MHT. In order to achieve an safe an effective hyperthermia therapy hydrided La(Fe,Si) 13 were then investigated. It was found that the compound could be used to prevent the overheating effect as well as to provide the giant heat generation at low effective magnetic field strength (H. f) for MHT in comparison to other magnetic suspensions studied in this research. Finally, to achieve hydrided La(Fe,Si) 13 nanoparticles, hydrided La(Fe,Si) 13 ribbons were milled using the surfactant-assisted ball milling method.

40|$|Background: In {{orthopaedic}} surgery, {{accumulation of}} agents such as anti-infectives {{in the bone}} as target tissue is difficult. The use of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as carriers principally enables their accumulation via an externally applied magnetic field. Magnetizable implants are principally able to increase the strength of an externally applied magnetic field to reach also deep-seated parts in the body. Therefore, the integration of bone-addressed therapeutics in MNPs and their accumulation at a magnetic orthopaedic implant could improve the treatment of implant related infections. In this study a martensitic steel platelet as implant placeholder {{was used to examine}} its accumulation and retention capacity of MNPs in an in vitro experimental set up considering different experimental frame conditions as magnet quantity and distance to each other, implant thickness and flow velocity. Results: The magnetic field strength increased to approximately 112 % when a martensitic stainless steel platelet was located between the magnet poles. Therewith a significantly higher amount of magnetic nanoparticles could be accumulated {{in the area of the}} platelet compared to the sole magnetic field. During flushing of the tube system mimicking the in vivo blood flow, the magnetized platelet was able to retain a higher amount of MNPs without an external magnetic field compared to the set up with no mounted platelet during flushing of the system. Generally, a higher flow velocity led to lower amounts of accumulated MNPs. A higher quantity of magnets and a lower distance between magnets led to a higher magnetic field strength. Albeit not significantly the magnetic field strength tended to increase with thicker platelets. Conclusion: A martensitic steel platelet significantly improved the attachment of magnetic nanoparticles in an in vitro flow system and therewith indicates the potential of <b>magnetic</b> <b>implant</b> materials in orthopaedic surgery.

40|$|Purpose : is {{to develop}} a {{technique}} for local subretinal injection of xenogeneic stem cells labeled with magnetic particles and to prove experimentally its effectiveness. Material and methods: We used a line of stem cells HEK- 293 GFP, labeled with magnetic particles. The study was made on 84 eyes of 42 chinchilla rabbits 6 months of age, the weight were from 2. 5 to 3. 5 kg. All right eyes were experimental (42 eyes) and all left eyes (42 eyes) were the control group.  In the experimental group we used original complex of polymer elastic <b>magnetic</b> <b>implant</b> (PEMI) with laser probe and fixed it to the sclera, then we made a median vitrectomy and injected HEK- 293 GFP under the retina using a specially designed dispenser. In the control group PEMI was not fixed. We examined animals using biomicroscopy, ophthalmoscopy, ultrasound scanning, optical coherence tomography  OCT), computer tomography (CT), morphological study (cryohistological sections) in 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 day and 1 month after surgery. Results: According the results of biomicroscopy in observation periods up to 3 days the vascular injection was visualized in the area operation. According the results of ophthalmoscopy and ultrasound scanning in 1 day the local retinal detachment was visualized in the area of local injection of the stem cells, which was not visualized in terms of further observations. CT helped us to confirm the local place of PEMI fixation. The morphological study results showed that cells were located in the subretinal space up to 14  days in the experimental group, and only up 3 days in the control group.

40|$|SUMMARY Sixty-six {{consecutive}} cases undergoing enucleation {{with the}} insertion of the Roper-Hall <b>magnetic</b> <b>implant</b> at the Birmingham and Midland Eye Hospital (BMEH) were followed up to re-establish the rate of extrusion. It was possible to study the records of all 66 patients. An extrusion rate of 1. 5 % was found. A number of implants have been designed {{with the intention of}} improving the cosmetic appearance after enucleation of the eye. Some were intended to improve the shape of the socket so that a prosthesis could be more satisfactorily fitted, others to give a more natural appearance by imparting movement to the prosthesis. These implants date from 1885, when Mules introduced a glass ball into the scleral cup and Frost a similar ball into Tenon's capsule. They did not provide the expected results. Inflammatory responses were common and the amount ofmovement imparted was disappointing. ' Integratfed, partly exposed implants were received with enthusiasm in the mid- 1940 s. 23 They gave excellent movement, but their long-term results were unsatisfactory. 4 We know of none which were retained. Experience with buried implants suggested that they were better retained but that mobility of the prosthesis was not so good. In many reported series the follow-up period has been limited and there is a repeatedly stated opinion that no implant, buried or unburied, has given satis-factory results in the long term. Tyers and Collins state that buried implants give extrusion rates of less than 5 %. They then go on to describe a 'baseball' implant, a sphere covered with donor sclera. They do not mention their extrusion rate but do advise suturing patches of donor sclera in cases of partial extrusion of their implant. Our experience has been more favourable with a buried hemispherical implant in-corporating a magnet 67 (Fig. 1).

40|$|Drug {{delivery}} technologies {{are an important}} area within biomedicine. Targeted drug delivery aims to reduce the undesired side effects of drug usage by directing or capturing the active agents near a desired site within the body. This is particularly beneficial in, for instance, cancer chemotherapy, where {{the side effects of}} general (systemic) drug administration can be severe. One approach to targeted drug delivery uses magnetic nanoparticles as the constituents of carriers for the desired active agent. Once injected into the body, the behaviour of these magnetic carriers can be influenced and controlled by magnetic fields. In implant assisted magnetic drug targeting systems a <b>magnetic</b> <b>implant,</b> typically a stent, wire or spherical seed can be used to target sites deep within the body as the implant acts as a focus for the resulting magnetic force. This can be easily understood as the force depends on the gradient of the magnetic field and the gradient near the implant is large. In designing such a system many factors need to be considered including physical factors such as the size and nature of the implants and carriers, and the fields required. Moreover the range of applicability of these systems in terms of the regions of the vasculature system, from low blood velocity environments, such as capillary beds to higher velocity arteries, must be considered. Furthermore, assessment criteria for these systems are needed. Mathematical modelling and simulation has a valuable role to play in informing in vitro and in vivo experiments, leading to practical system design. Specifically, the implant assisted magnetic drug targeting systems of Avil´es, Ebner and Ritter are considered within this work, and two dimensional mathematical modelling is performed using the open source C++ finite volume library OpenFOAM. In the first system treated, a large ferromagnetic particle is implanted into a capillary bed as a seed to aid collection of single domain nanoparticles (radius 20 - 100 nm). The Langevin function is used to calculate the magnetic moment of the particles, and the model is further adapted to treat the agglomeration of particles known to occur in these systems. This agglomeration can be attributed to interparticle interactions and here the magnetic dipole-dipole and hydrodynamic interactions for two mutually interacting nanoparticles are modelled, following Mikkelsen et al. who treated two particle interactions in microfluidic systems, with low magnetic field (0. 05 T). The resulting predicted performance is found to both increase and decrease significantly depending on initial positions of the particles. Secondly, a ferromagnetic, coiled wire stent is implanted in a large arterial vessel. The magnetic dipole-dipole and hydrodynamic interactions for multiple (N < 20) particles are included. Different initial positions are considered and the system performance is assessed. Inclusion of these interactions yields predictions that are in closer agreement with the experimental results of Avil´es et al [...] We conclude that the discrepancies between the non interacting theoretical predictions and the corresponding experimental results can (as suggested by Avil´es et al.) be largely attributed to interparticle interactions and the consequent agglomeration...|$|E

30|$|The primary {{limitation}} of MDT {{relates to the}} strength of the external magnetic field [12] as the magnetic gradient decreases rapidly with increasing distance to the target. A magnetic field must be applied to obtain the necessary magnetic gradient to control the residence time of NPs in the desired area. As a means to overcome limitations of using external <b>magnetic</b> fields, <b>implant</b> magnets [13] or ferromagnetic microwires [14] can be located {{in the vicinity of the}} target using minimally invasive surgery. Several studies [15, 16] have simulated the interaction between <b>magnetic</b> <b>implants</b> and <b>magnetic</b> NPs, enabling drug delivery. Another limitation relates to the small size of NPs, a requisite for superparamagnetism, which is needed to avoid embolization once the magnetic field is removed. Nonetheless, a small size implies a magnetic response of reduced strength. This makes it difficult to magnetically direct drug-loaded particles and keep them in the proximity of the target while withstanding the drag force of blood flow. MDT is likely to be more effective in lower blood velocities, particularly when the magnet is close to the target site. In addition, most intravenously applied NPs are recognized as “foreign” by the body system. They are immediately eliminated by macrophages of a mononuclear phagocytosis system (MPS). Generally, smaller NPs are subject to rapid elimination while larger ones show uptake by the liver, spleen, and bone marrow [17]. Based on the biokinetics of the particles, a drug-loaded carrier size range of approximately 10 – 200 nm in diameter is optimal for in vivo delivery, as the small particles (D< 10 nm) escape by renal clearance [18] and the large ones (D> 200 nm) are quickly eliminated by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) of the spleen and liver [18], as illustrated in Fig. 1.|$|R

We measured {{the depth of the}} implants by ultrasonography, and applied computational simulations to the calculation of the different pressure values, considering the different distances between implants and external magnets. Results: nineteen implants presented complications. The remaining 11 were submitted to different magnetic compression forces and perfusion analysis. Two linear regression models showed an inverse correlation between exerted pressure and cutaneous perfusion, with significant variation, mainly in the initial pressure increases, of up to 20 mmHg. Conclusion: The main reduction in cutaneous blood flow resulted from initial increases of up to 20 mmHg. The results suggest that tissue ischemia can occur even in low-pressure regimes, which could contribute to the appearance of skin lesions, particularly ulcers related to medical devices...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{hyperthermia}} ablation {{has attracted}} wide attention in tumor therapy for its minimal invasion. Although the chemo-hyperthermal synergism {{has been proven}} {{to be effective in}} subcutaneously xenografted tumors of nude mice in our previous experiment, the occurrence of residual tumors due to incomplete ablation is more common in relatively larger and deeper-seated tumors in anti-tumor therapy. Thus, a larger tumor and larger animal model are needed for further study of the therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we tested the efficiency of this newly developed technique using a rabbit tumor model. Furthermore, we chose cisplatin (DDP), which has been confirmed with high efficiency in enhancing hyperthermia therapy as the chemotherapeutic drug for the synergistic magnetic hyperthermal ablation therapy of tumors. In vitro studies demonstrated that developed DDP-loaded <b>magnetic</b> <b>implants</b> (DDP/PLGA-Fe 3 O 4) have great heating efficacy and the drug release can be significantly boosted by an external alternating magnetic field (AMF). In vivo studies showed that the phase-transitional DDP/PLGA-Fe 3 O 4 materials that are ultrasound (US) and computerized tomography (CT) visible can be well confined in the tumor tissues after injection. When exposed to AMF, efficient hyperthermia was induced, which led to the cancer cells' coagulative necrosis and accelerating release of the drug to kill residual tumors. Furthermore, an activated anti-tumor immune system can promote apoptosis of tumor cells. In conclusion, the DDP/PLGA-Fe 3 O 4 implants can be used efficiently for the combined chemotherapy and magnetic-hyperthermia ablation of rabbit tumors...|$|R
50|$|With RFA, {{vibrations}} {{are being}} used to determine stability, but on a micro scale and in a non-invasive manner. A metal peg (transducer) with a magnet top is attached to the <b>implant.</b> <b>Magnetic</b> pulses (alternating sine waves of uniform amplitude) cause the peg to vibrate, increasing steadily in pitch until the implant resonates. The higher the resonant frequency, the more stable the implant.|$|R
