5|$|The Mississippi ships had poor {{seakeeping}} qualities, {{making them}} poor gunnery platforms underway in Atlantic waters. Their motion was irregular, and their low length-to-beam ratio caused excessive rolling and pitching, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to keep the}} guns on target. The reduced length, significantly cut away from the aft, <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to keep the ships on a consistent course, even in smoother waters.|$|E

5|$|A {{problem with}} early bombsights {{was that they}} could only correct {{for the effects of}} the wind in a simple way and {{required}} the bomber to fly directly up- or down-wind from the target, to minimise the complexity of the required calculations. This <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to attack moving targets and allowed anti-aircraft artillery to sight their weapons along the wind line.|$|E
5|$|Al-Maʿarri was an ascetic, renouncing worldly {{desires and}} living secluded from others while {{producing}} his works. He opposed {{all forms of}} violence. In Baghdad, while being well received, {{he decided not to}} sell his texts, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> for him to live. This ascetic lifestyle has been compared to similar thought in India during his time.|$|E
5|$|Building traditions {{varied by}} region {{and type of}} structure. Food storage houses - stabbur - were usually built on stilts in ways that <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> for mice and rats, but not cats, to get in. Exterior {{cladding}} varied by region, often {{to take into account}} local climate conditions. Roofs were often covered with birch bark and sod.|$|E

5|$|In December 2012, {{official}} servers for Thrones and Patriots {{were shut}} down by GameSpy Technologies, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> for multiplayer matches to be played officially online.

5|$|Since 1948, {{successive}} {{governments have}} adopted policies {{that had the}} net effect of assisting the Sinhalese community in such areas as education and public employment.

5|$|Subsequent {{political}} developments <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to hold large organised rallies at the site. Catalan political gatherings were banned during the 1923–1930 dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, travel was difficult during the 1936–1939 Spanish Civil War, and political gatherings were again banned during (and {{for some time}} after) the Franco dictatorship of 1939–1975.|$|E
5|$|The French {{invasion}} of Russia, where poor traction conditions for ill-shod horses <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> for supply wagons {{to keep up}} with troops. That campaign was also strongly affected by cold, whereby the retreating army reached Neman River in December 1812 with only 10,000 of the 420,000 that had set out to invade Russia in June of the same year.|$|E
5|$|While many reviews {{applauded the}} single-player campaign, the {{multiplayer}} mode bore {{the brunt of}} the game's criticism, with MacDonald, Speer and Miller all finding fault with it, describing it as lackluster and stating that the difference between the developer's vision for the game mode and the finished product <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to enjoy.|$|E

5|$|Because Eastern European Romani {{communities}} were less organised than Jewish communities, Porajmos {{was not well}} documented. There also existed a trend to downplay the actual figures, according to Ian Hancock, director of the Program of Romani Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. Tony Gatlif, whose films mostly have Romani people as subjects, had long {{wanted to make a}} documentary on this less well-known subject, but the lack of enough documented evidence coupled with the absence of accurate pre-war census figures for the Romani <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult.</b>|$|E
5|$|Belgrano also {{experienced}} paludism (malaria) {{during the second}} campaign to Upper Peru. On 3 May 1815 he informed the government of his disease, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> for him to work or even talk. He was treated by doctor Joseph Readhead, who employed a local species of the Cinchona medicinal plant. The disease lasted up to his stay in Britain, when his health improved because of the treatment and by having left the endemic zone.|$|E
5|$|Bethesda Softworks {{developed}} a spin-off iOS game, Dishonored: Rat Assassin, which it released {{free of charge}} on 30 August 2012. The game requires players to use a knife and crossbow to kill rats while avoiding bombs. Rat Assassin was well received for the variety and quantity of content provided, but received some criticism for dark visuals, that <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to see the rats. The game drew frequent comparisons to another mobile game, Fruit Ninja.|$|E

5|$|During this time, the {{authorities}} imposed a ban preventing Rajab {{from engaging in}} any new business in Bahrain that <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> for him to earn a living.

According to Rajab, an order for his arrest was issued on 8 September but was cancelled on 18 October. Rajab was also subject to a travel ban during this period.|$|E
5|$|HAT-P-33b's {{existence}} was first suggested after observations by the six-telescope HATnet collaboration, {{a project that}} searches the sky for planets in transit of, or crossing in front of, their host stars. The presence of a planet in HAT-P-33's orbit had been suspected as early as 2004, although high levels of jitter were detected. This jitter, or a random and shaky appearance that clouds the accuracy of measurements, <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to easily verify the radial velocity of the planetary candidate's host star, which usually leads summarily to the planet's confirmation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} few weeks of 2010, there was renewed anxiety about {{excessive}} national debt, with lenders demanding ever-higher interest rates from several countries with higher debt levels, deficits, and current account deficits. This in turn <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> for four out of eighteen Eurozone governments to finance further budget deficits and repay or refinance existing government debt, particularly when economic growth rates were low, and when a high percentage of debt was in the hands of foreign creditors, {{as in the case of}} Greece and Portugal.|$|E
