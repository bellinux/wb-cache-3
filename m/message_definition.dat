50|$|An initial {{proposal}} for defining RDS-TMC data fields {{had been made}} to the European Conference of Ministers of Transport (ECMT) in Madrid, based on a scheme developed by CCETT and Philips in the Eureka-sponsored CARMINAT research project. This proposal required the use of at least two 104-bit RDS data groups for each message. Within these RDS Groups, 32 bits per group would be used for traffic data, giving a total traffic message length of 64 bits. A second proposal, by Bosch-Blaupunkt and the German Road Research Institute BASt, sought to use just a single RDS Group per traffic message. Then, in 1987, the CEC invited Castle Rock Consultants to lead a joint team that would take TMC development a stage further. CRC produced a {{proposal for}} a modified BASt/Blaupunkt single group <b>message</b> <b>definition,</b> which became known as the ALERT A coding scheme.

40|$|A Modular Integrated Syntactic/Semantic XML Data Validation Solution Data {{integration}} between disparate {{systems can be}} difficult when there are distinct data formats and constraints from a syntactic and semantic perspective. Such differences can {{be the source of}} miscommunication that can lead to incorrect data interpretations. What we propose is to leverage XML as means to define not only syntactic constraints, but also semantic constraints. ^ XML having been widely adopted across multiple industries, is heavily used as a data protocol. However, commonly used XML parsers have only embedded syntactic validation. In other words, if semantic constraints are needed, these come into play after a parser has validated the XML message. Furthermore, semantic constraints tend to be declared inside the client system, either in the code itself or in some other form of persistent storage such as a database. Our solution to this problem is to integrate the syntactic and semantic validation phases into a single parser. This way, all syntactic and semantic rules can be configured outside the client system. For our purposes, semantic rules are defined as co-constraints. Co-constraints are when the value, presence or absence of an element or attribute is dependent on the value, presence or absence of another element or attribute in the same XML message. Using this same concept, we have also built a parser that, based on co-constraints, can express business constraints that transcend the <b>message</b> <b>definition.</b> Our research provides a reusable modular middleware solution that integrates syntactic and semantic validation. We also demonstrate how the same semantic validating parser can be used to execute business rules triggered by semantic rules. ^ Combining semantic and syntactic validation in the same XML parser or interpreter is a powerful solution to quick {{integration between}} disparate systems. A key of our proposal is also to have the syntax definition and semantic definitions separate, allowing them to evolve independently. One can imagine how syntax might not change between systems, but the semantic constraints can differ between message consumers. ...|$|E
40|$|To {{better serve}} society, {{infrastructure}} organizations must manage their civil infrastructure systems effectively and efficiently, employing {{best practices in}} infrastructure management and relevant information systems. As information systems mature, communications follow a general trend away from informal human-to-human communications towards computer-to-computer information exchange. For efficient implementation of computer-based exchange of information, these communications must be formally described. As {{part of a larger}} study into the formalization of communications within the infrastructure industry, this paper examines the level to which work processes and communications are formalized and designed at present within the domain of infrastructure management. The research adopts a maturity model approach. There are many maturity models available in different industries, but their focus is on the maturity of the way work processes and communication are operated and managed, not the way these work processes and communications are formalized and designed. To address the issue, an Infrastructure Management-Process Maturity Model (IM-PMM) is developed to assess the degree to which work processes and communications are formalized within a specific engineering domain, namely infrastructure management. A five-step approach is used to develop the IM-PMM: define the problem, compare existing maturity models, develop the model, apply the model, and evaluate the maturity model. This paper describes the development and application of the Infrastructure Management-Process Maturity Model (IM-PMM) that can benchmark the current level of maturity of work processes and communications in the domain of infrastructure management. The proposed IM-PMM uses a scale of five levels of maturity (stages) and uses three core elements (i. e. process/transaction map definition, actor/role definition, and information definition) to benchmark existing work processes, plus one additional element (<b>message</b> <b>definition)</b> to benchmark existing communications. The proposed model has been applied and tested in the domain of infrastructure management using a structured interview approach. The resulting data show that existing work processes and communications are typically accomplished in an ad hoc manner, emphasizing the need for further improvements in the way that work processes and communications are defined if infrastructure organizations intend to deploy advanced information systems. The proposed IM-PMM would help the transaction development personnel (including transaction analysts, transaction designers, software developers, process modellers, and industry experts) to assess and benchmark the maturity of the work processes and communications in the domain of infrastructure. As part of the evaluation, the proposed IM-PMM is verified through testing and applying it in the domain of infrastructure management; future work will conduct validation through industry expert review...|$|E

An important {{issue is the}} management of the messages that flow into and out of these services to ultimately compose higher-level functions. A significant problem occurs when service providers loosely define these mes-sages resulting into many services that in effect cannot be easily integrated. State of the art research explores semantic methods for dealing with this notion of data integration. The assumption is that service providers will define mes-sages in an unpredictable manner. In our work, we investigate the nature of <b>message</b> <b>definitions</b> by analyzing real, fully-operational web services currently available on the Internet (i. e. from the wild). As a result, we have discovered insights into how real web services messages are defined as affected by the ten-dencies of the web services developers.
