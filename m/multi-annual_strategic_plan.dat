In spite of the importance of <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> schools do not formulate <b>strategic</b> <b>plans.</b> The {{purpose of the study was}} to find out the effectiveness of <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> in public primary schools in Suneka Division, Kisii County, Kenya. The objectives of the study were to determine whether public primary schools of Suneka Division, Kisii County formulate <b>strategic</b> <b>plans,</b> to examine the framework compositions of the plans, to find out the parties involved in <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> and to analyze the effectiveness of <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> in public primary schools of Suneka, Division, Kisii County, Kenya. The target population of the proposed study was 52 head teachers, 580 teachers 103 SMC chairpersons, treasures and members and DQASO Kisii South District. The entire sampling size yielded 101 respondents involving 20 head teachers, 60 teachers 20 SMC chairpersons, treasures and members and DQASO Kisii South District. Data collection was carried out using questionnaires, Semi-structured interview schedules and focus group discussions. The questionnaires were used to collect data from head teachers and teachers. The interview schedules were used to conduct interviews with SMC chairpersons, SMC treasures and SMC members and DQASO. From the findings 48. 5 percent of respondents had prepared <b>strategic</b> <b>plans</b> once, 25. 8 percent had prepared only thrice and 4. 4 percent had not prepared any. It was also realized that 58. 5 percent of the respondents followed all the process of <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> while 41. 5 percent did not follow all the processes. From study findings 60 percent, 83. 1 percent, 50. 8 percent, 14. 1 percent, 10. 4 percent and 13. 7 percent of head teachers, SMC, teachers, Ministry of Education officials, support staff and sponsors respectively are involved in the <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> process. It was also realized that 17. 9 of the plans are fully implemented, 79. 1 percent of the plans are implemented half way, while 3. 0 percent are not implemented.

The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> and the organizational effectiveness with the examination of a wider list of <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> dimensions and different approaches and measures to assess the <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> effectiveness in the case of the Republic of Macedonia, as well as to conduct comparative analysis of the <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> effectiveness in different emerging and developing countries. After the initial processing of the total number of received questionnaires, 113 questionnaires proceeded to the next phase of processing, as companies were found to be strategic planners. Two regression models were performed, enclosed with necessary tests, as well as in order to achieve unidimensionality, factor analysis was performed for all stated items for each of the investigated variables. The empirical analysis conducted in Macedonian companies shows that <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> can generally contribute to organizational effectiveness. A significant correlation between different <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> dimensions and the <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> effectiveness was found in the relationship between the formality of <b>strategic</b> <b>planning,</b> the management participation in <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> and the employee participation in <b>strategic</b> <b>planning.</b> The comparative analysis conducted in this study with the purpose of comparing the case of Republic of Macedonia with the studies in the other emerging and developing counties, and indicating the probable reasons for potential differences in <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> effectiveness in different counties, refers to useful knowledge conclusions. The originality and the value of the study for the literature and theoretical knowledge lies in the attempt for the <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> effectiveness to be investigated for first time on the ground of many emerging and developing counties from the regions of Eastern, Central and especially South-Eastern Europe, as well as for a comparative analysis to be conducted with several non-European emerging and developing counties, with useful conclusions about the <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> and its relationship with organizational effectiveness Practical implications refer to setting up the different dimensions of the <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> practice in a way that will enhance the <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> effectiveness and give useful suggestions to managers by focusing their efforts on the effective <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> practice. Considering that this study has been conducted in the Republic of Macedonia and that the <b>strategic</b> <b>planning</b> practice can be subject to some contingencies i. e. some cultural and institutional environment influences, much can be done in future research in this direction...|$|R
