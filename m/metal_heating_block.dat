25|$|Artificial fog is {{man-made}} fog that {{is usually}} created by vaporizing a water- and glycol-based or glycerine-based fluid. The fluid is injected into a <b>heated</b> <b>metal</b> <b>block,</b> and evaporates quickly. The resulting pressure forces the vapor out of a vent. Upon coming into contact with cool outside air, the vapor condenses in microscopic droplets and appears as fog. Such fog machines are primarily used for entertainment applications.|$|R

But the design of conventional PCR thermocycling hardware, predominantly based on massive <b>metal</b> <b>heating</b> <b>blocks</b> whose temperature is regulated by thermoelectric heaters, severely limits the achievable reaction speed 1. Considerable electrical power is also required to repeatedly heat and cool the reagent mixture, limiting the ability to deploy these instruments in a portable format. Thermal convection {{has emerged as a}} promising alternative thermocycling approach that has the potential to overcome these limitations 2 - 9. Convective flows are an everyday occurrence in a diverse array of settings ranging from the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and interior, to decorative and colorful lava lamps. Fluid motion is initiated in the same way in each case: a buoyancy driven instability arises when a confined volume of fluid is subjected to a spatial temperature gradient. These same phenomena offer an attractive way to perform PCR thermocycling. By applying a static temperature gradient across an appropriately designed reactor geometry, a continuous circulatory flow can be established that will repeatedly transport PCR reagents through temperature zones associated with the denaturing, annealing, and extension stages of the reaction (Figure 1). Thermocycling can therefore be actuated in a pseudo-isothermal manner by simply holding two opposing surfaces at fixed temperatures, completely eliminating the need to repeatedly heat and cool the instrument. One of the main challenges facing design of convective thermocyclers is the need to precisely control the spatial velocity and temperatur...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{tests of}} a prototype {{fire suppression system}} installed in the engine compartment of a test vehicle. The prototype fire suppression systeni consisted of 2 Solid Propellant Gas Generators (SPGG) and two optical detectors. These components was installed {{on the hood of}} the test vehicle and powered from the battery in the test vehicle. The test vehicle was subjected to a crash test in which power steering fluid expelled onto the exhaust manifold autoignited. In this test, the prototype fire suppression system failed to extinguish this fire. A series of four static fire tests were conducted using the crash tested vehicle. For these static fire tests, the vehicle was stationary. Two fully charged SPGG units were installed in the test vehicle before each test. The first static fire test involved manual activation of the SPGG unite without a fire underhood. This was done to evaluate the effect of the SPGG discharge on underhood components. In the subsequent three static fire tests, fires were ignited in the engine compartment using an electrical igniter or by spraying power steering fluid onto a <b>metal</b> <b>block</b> <b>heated</b> by electrical heaters.

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} an electrically-energized device for the rapid {{generation of steam}} or other vapors. The high-speed steam generator includes a wicked evaporator, a liquid reservoir, a liquid supply pipe, and a vapor transport tube. The evaporator consists of a low-thermal-conductivity porous wick, heated from a downward-facing grooved <b>heating</b> <b>block</b> that is in intimate contact with the upper surface of the wick structure. The grooved <b>heating</b> <b>block</b> is made of a copper block in which electric cartridge heaters are installed. As a heat load is applied on the <b>heating</b> <b>block,</b> an extremely steep temperature gradient is established immediately at the upper surface of the wick so that water from the saturated wick evaporates rapidly adjacent to the heated surface. Subsequently, menisci are formed at the vapor/liquid interface to develop a capillary force to pump subcooled liquid into the wick from the liquid reservoir. A plurality of grooves in the <b>heating</b> <b>block</b> allow the resulting vapor to instantaneously escape from the heated surface so that a high heat transfer rate from the <b>heating</b> <b>block</b> to the saturated wick can be maintained at all time...|$|R
