5|$|Due to {{cutbacks in}} federal, {{state and local}} budgets, UCF has had over $140 million in funds cut from its {{operating}} budget since 2008. This included a $53 million cut to UCF's 2012–13 fiscal year budget by the Florida legislature. So far UCF {{has been able to}} endure the budget cuts by implementing a hiring freeze, putting an end to some faculty perks, such as free seminars, cutting executive pay, and through wise <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds.</b> To help counter the budget decreases, the university received $18 million in funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. UCF's operating budget for the 2014–15 fiscal year is $1.5 billion, a 13.9% increase from the previous year. UCF's financial endowment, administered by the University of Central Florida Foundation, Inc., was valued at $155.5 million in 2015, a 14.7% increase from 2014.|$|E

2500|$|Hedge funds {{share many}} of the same types of risk as other {{investment}} classes, including liquidity risk and manager risk. Liquidity refers to the degree to which an asset can be bought and sold or converted to cash; similar to private equity funds, hedge funds employ a lock-up period during which an investor cannot remove money. Manager risk refers to those risks which arise from the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds.</b> As well as specific risks such as style drift, which refers to a fund manager [...] "drifting" [...] away from an area of specific expertise, manager risk factors include valuation risk, capacity risk, concentration risk and leverage risk. Valuation risk refers to the concern that the net asset value of investments may be inaccurate; capacity risk can arise from placing too much money into one particular strategy, which may lead to fund performance deterioration; and concentration risk may arise if a fund has too much exposure to a particular investment, sector, trading strategy, or group of correlated funds. These risks may be managed through defined controls over conflict of interest, restrictions on allocation of funds, and set exposure limits for strategies.|$|E
40|$|M. ed. This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> allocated <b>funds</b> in Gauteng schools. April 1994 witnessed {{the birth of a}} new and democratic South Africa. This birth has meant the need for changes in various areas in the efficient and effective governance of the new South Africa. Education is one area affected by this change. It poses a challenge that includes a range of problematic issues such as inadequate resources, the absence of a culture of learning and teaching, and most recently, the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> allocated <b>funds</b> to schools by the provincial education departments. The effective <b>management</b> <b>of</b> allocated <b>funds</b> is critical for the payment of services such as electricity, water and sewerage the purchase of learning material for teaching; and the maintenance of the school buildings. The aim of this research is to: • analyse the official documents for the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> allocated <b>funds</b> for section 21 schools; • critically evaluate the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> allocated <b>funds</b> m three countries (Botswana, Australia and Malawi) • evaluate and compare the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> school <b>funds</b> in schools that have section 21 functions, and those without these functions. The following research methods were employed to gather the relevant research data: (1) Literature study; (2) Focus group interviews and site analyses of two schools (one with Section 21 functions and one without) on how they manage the allocated funds. This included observations and interviews with the principals and chairperson of the fmance committee. The study concludes with recommendations and guidelines for the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> allocated <b>funds</b> for section 21 schools...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the {{possibility}} of having a [...] "retirement" [...] became real as people lived longer, and believed the elderly {{should not have to}} work or rely on charity until they died. The law maintain an income in retirement in three ways (1) through public social security created by the Social Security Act of 1935, (2) occupational pensions managed through the employment relationship, and (3) private pensions or life insurance that individuals buy themselves. At work, most occupational pension schemes originally resulted from collective bargaining during the 1920s and 1930s. Unions usually bargained to have employers across a sector to pool funds, so that employees could keep their pensions if they moved jobs. Multi-employer retirement plans, set up by collective agreement became known as [...] "Taft-Hartley plans" [...] after the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 required joint <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> by employees and employers. Many employers also voluntarily choose to provide pensions. For example, the pension for professors, now called TIAA, was established on the initiative of Andrew Carnegie in 1918 with express requirement for participants to have voting rights for the plan trustees. These could be collective and defined benefit schemes: a percentage of one's income (e.g. 67%) is replaced for retirement, however long the person lives. But more recently more employers have only provided individual [...] "401(k)" [...] plans. These are named after the Internal Revenue Code §401(k), which allows employers and employees to pay no tax on money that is saved in the fund, until an employee retires. The same tax deferral rule applies to all pensions. But unlike a [...] "defined benefit" [...] plan, a 401(k) only contains whatever the employer and employee contribute. It will run out if a person lives too long, meaning the retiree may only have to rely only on minimum social security. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 §902 codified a model for employers to automatically enroll their employees in a pension, with a right to opt out. There is no right to an occupational pension, but the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 does create a series of rights for employees if one is set up. It also applies to health care or any other [...] "employee benefit" [...] plan.|$|E
