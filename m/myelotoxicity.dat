25|$|The enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is {{responsible}} for various activation and deactivation steps in azathioprine's mechanism of action. The first metabolic step that azathioprine undergoes in the body is the conversion to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP; see Pharmacokinetics), which is itself an immunosuppressant prodrug. The TPMT enzyme {{is responsible}}, in part, for the methylation of 6-MP into the inactive metabolite 6-methylmercaptopurine - this methylation prevents 6-MP from further conversion into active, cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) metabolites. Certain genetic variations within the TPMT gene can lead to decreased or absent TPMT enzyme activity, and individuals who are homozygous or heterozygous for these types of genetic variations may have increased levels of TGN metabolites and {{an increased risk of}} severe bone marrow suppression (myelosuppression) when receiving azathioprine. In many ethnicities, TPMT polymorphisms that result in decreased or absent TPMT activity occur with a frequency of approximately 5%, meaning that about 0.25% of patients are homozygous for these variants. However, an assay of TPMT activity in red blood cells or a TPMT genetic test can identify patients with reduced TPMT activity, allowing for the adjustment of azathioprine dose or avoidance of the drug entirely. The FDA-approved drug label for azathioprine recommends testing for TPMT activity to identify patients at risk for <b>myelotoxicity.</b> Indeed, testing for TPMT activity is currently one of the few examples of pharmacogenetics being translated into routine clinical care.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The role {{of total}} {{parenteral}} nutrition (TPN) in reducing toxicity related to cancer chemotherapy (CT) is presently a controversial issue. To {{evaluate the effectiveness}} of TPN in reducing CT-associated toxicity and correcting and preventing CT-related impairments of nutritional status, a prospective crossover controlled study was performed in 43 cancer patients (19 normally nourished and 24 malnourished) randomly divided into two groups (A and B). Group A patients received TPN concomitantly with the first course of chemo-therapy, and the second course was administered 21 to 28 days later without TPN support; group B patients were treated in the opposite sequence. The rates of <b>myelotoxicities</b> and gastrointestinal toxicities after CT courses with or without TPN were essentially similar in normally nourished and malnourished patients.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, {{the depth}} and length of which are {{correlated}} {{to the risk of}} febrile neutropenia (FN) and neutropenia sepsis, remains a serious problem in medical oncology. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF) stimulate the proliferation and survival of neutrophils and their precursors, thereby reducing the incidence, duration and severity of neutropenic events across a broad range of malignancies and regimens, often enabling the delivery of full chemotherapy dose intensity. AREAS COVERED: In this review, areas covered include the physiologic role of G-CSF in granulopoiesis, as well as a related biological model of bone marrow kinetics after chemotherapy. Information relating to the application of clinical guidelines for optimization of prophylaxis of FN in adult cancer patients was critically summarized. The literature and pharmacological data were obtained through an electronic search. EXPERT OPINION: There are relevant physiological and clinical evidences for the use of G-CSF to prevent FN and to ameliorate the <b>myelotoxicities</b> of cancer chemotherapy. In particular, biological models are in favor of the prophylactic rather than therapeutic use of G-CSF therapy. Use of a single dose of pegfilgrastim per cycle in appropriate patients provides a more convenient and potentially more effective strategy for assisting neutrophil recovery. While biosimilars may cost less, future developments in their regulation will need to address multiple issues. In the interim, physicians should remember that small differences in biochemical and biophysical characteristics might translate into differences in potency and immunogenic potential...|$|R
40|$|In a multicenter phase II Italian {{trial that}} used a 28 -day dosing {{schedule}} of gemcitabine on days 1, 8, and 15 and cisplatin on day 2, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia {{were the main}} dose-limiting toxicities observed. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine whether using 15 -day cisplatin in lieu of the standard 2 -day schedule in combination with weekly gemcitabine would decrease expected <b>myelotoxicities,</b> particularly thrombocytopenia. Fifty-one patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a median age of 62 years (range 31 - 76) and baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status scores of 0 - 1, were enrolled. Twenty-four patients had stage IIIA-B disease and 27 had stage IV. Patients received gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, 15, and cisplatin 100 mg/m(2) on day- 15, every 28 days for a total of 151 cycles. All patients were evaluable for toxicity. Grades 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia was observed in 16 % of patients, grades 3 and 4 neutropenia in 35 % of patients, and grade 3 anemia in 4 % of patients (no grade 4 anemia). Nonhematologic toxicity was mild. Two patients had grade 3 vomiting, and another had grade 4 hepatic toxicity only after gemcitabine administration. The dose intensity of gemcitabine and cisplatin was well maintained. Of the 45 patients evaluable for response, there were 22 (49 %) partial responders, 7 (15. 5 %) minimal responders, 9 (20 %) with stable disease, and 7 (15. 5 %) progressions. Compared with the schedule used in a multicenter phase II Italian trial (day 2 cisplatin), day- 15 cisplatin decreases incidences of thrombocytopenia (16 vs. 52 %) and anemia (4 vs. 25 %); the occurrence of neutropenia is similar (35 vs. 36 %).

40|$|Background: Temozolomide (TemodalR, TMZ) is {{an active}} alkylating agent for the {{treatment}} of gliomas. Conventional dosing of TMZ consists of an oral dose of 150 - 200 mg/m²/day for 5 consecutive days every 28 days. Extended daily dosing of TMZ might be more active because of the depletion of the AGAT repair protein. TMZ administered for 21 consecutive days (at a dose of 100 mg/m²/day) every 28 days, is being tested in a multicenter Belgian phase II study {{for the treatment of}} recurrent anaplastic (oligo) astrocytoma. We report the toxicity that was associated with this regimen at the occasion of the first interim monitoring of the adverse events. Methods: For the monitoring of toxicity (CTCAEv 3. 0), the protocol requested a weekly clinical and hematological evaluation during the first 8 wks and every 2 wks thereafter. An interim analysis was carried out for the toxicity seen during the first 67 administered treatment cycles. Results: 17 patients (pts) were recruited into this study (4 F, 13 M; median age 42 y, range 23 - 69 y). A median nr of 4 cycles were administered per pt (range 1 - 12). The most frequent observed adverse event was lymphopenia (LP); 14 / 17 pts experienced at least 1 episode of LP; Gr 3 LP: 12 pts (20 cycles) and gr 4 LP: 4 pts (8 cycles). For the 28 cycles associated with gr 3 / 4 LP, only 5 times treatment was adjusted according to protocol. There was a low incidence of other <b>myelotoxicities</b> (3 x gr 3 / 4 thrombocytopenia in 3 pts, 2 x gr 4 neutropenia, and no gr 3 / 4 anemia). There was no case of febrile neutropenia. One pt had a herpes zoster reactivation (with concomitant gr 2 LP). There was only 1 event of gr 3 vomiting, 1 x gr 3 skin rash and 1 x gr 3 increase in AST/ALT and gammaGT. Updated results on toxicity and an analysis of tumor response will be reported at the meeting (including an 8 additional months of follow-up). Conclusions: Extended dosing of TMZ by a 21 / 28 days scheme in pts with recurrent anaplastic (oligo) astrocytoma, has a low-toxicity profile but is associated with a high incidence of lymphopenia. This toxicity profile is different from what is seen with the more conventional 5 out of 28 days schedule and investigators should pay attention to this uncommon toxicitystatus: publishe...|$|R

Although TMZ {{is considered to be}} a safe drug, it has been demonstrated to cause severe myelotoxicity; in particular, some case reports and small series studies have reported severe <b>myelotoxicity</b> developing during TMZ and concomitant RT. We performed a prospective study to analyze the incidence of early severe <b>myelotoxicity</b> and its possible clinical and genetic factors. Patients and Methods:From November 2010 to July 2012, newly diagnosed GBM patients were enrolled. They were eligible for the study if they met the following criteria: pathologically proven GBM, age 18 years and older, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2, adequate renal and hepatic function, and adequate blood cell counts before starting TMZ plus RT. Grading of hematologic toxicity developing during radiation and TMZ was based on the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4. 0. Clinical factors from all patients were recorded. The methylation status and polymorphic variants of O- 6 -methylguanine-DNAmethyl-transferase gene in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and polymorphic genetic variants of genes involved in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of TMZ, were analyzed. For genetic analyses, patients with toxicity were matched (1 : 2) for age, performance status, anticonvulsants, and proton pump inhibitors with patients without <b>myelotoxicity.</b> Results:We enrolled 87 consecutive GBM patients: 32 women and 55 men; the average age was 60 years. During TMZ and RT, 4 patients (5 %) showed grade 3 - 4 <b>myelotoxicity,</b> and its median duration was 255 days. Predictor factors of severe <b>myelotoxicity</b> were female sex, pretreatment platelet count of 3, 00, 000 /mm(3), methylated O- 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter in the hematopoietic cell system, and specific polymorphic variants of the cytochrome P 450 oxidoreductase and methionine adenosyltransferase 1 A genes. Conclusions:Although we studied a small population, we suggest that both clinical and genetic factors might simultaneously be associated with severe myelosuppression developed during TMZ plus RT.

Results: ECAT reduced the blood content of RIC by 95 %. Thus, <b>myelotoxicity</b> was significantly milder in animals subjected to ECAT than that in controls. The timing of ECAT influenced the rate and level of bone marrow recovery, with an earlier recovery in animals subjected to ECAT early after injection. The toxicity-reducing effect of ECAT was more distinct in animals injected with Lu- 177 -labeled RIC than in animals injected with 90 Y-labeled RIC.

Investigation of S. umbellatum <b>myelotoxicity</b> was performed by clonogenic assay of colony forming unit- granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM). Results and ConclusionOur results demonstrated that S. umbellatum decreased the viability of EAT cells using both methods. Morphological analyses revealed that S. umbellatum-treatment induced EAT cell death by apoptotic pathway. We demonstrated the occurrence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) overgeneration, increased intracellular Ca 2 + concentration, alteration in mitochondrial membrane potential, phosphatydylserine externalization, and activation of caspases 3, 8, and 9. However, S. umbellatum produced <b>myelotoxicity</b> in bone marrow cells in a concentration-dependent manner. In comparison to EAT cells, the effects of S. umbellatum in bone marrow cells were 8 -fold lower. Taken together, our results showed that S. umbellatum induced apoptosis in EAT cells at several levels and seems more toxic to tumor cells than to normal bone marrow cells...|$|E
40|$|Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor is {{predominantly}} a childhood tumor and {{has only been}} rarely reported in adults; therefore, treatment regimens are often extrapolated from the pediatric experience. Typically, children are treated with craniospinal radiation therapy which is often followed by systemic chemotherapy. Employing pediatric regimens to treat this tumor in adult patients poses a particular risk for myelosuppression, as the prescribed doses in pediatric protocols exceed those tolerated by adults, and conventional craniospinal radiation {{can be associated with}} prolonged <b>myelotoxicity</b> and a depletion of the bone marrow reserve in vertebrae of adults. Here we present a case of a woman with a pineal region atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor, an unusual adult cancer presenting in an atypical location. This is followed by a review of the disease in adult patients with an emphasis on treatment and suggestions to minimize <b>myelotoxicity...</b>|$|E
40|$|Enzymes {{involved}} in benzene metabolism are likely genetic determinants of benzene-induced toxicity. Polymorphisms in hu-man microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) {{are associated with}} an increased risk of developing leukemia, specifically those associated with benzene. This study was designed to investigate the impor-tance of mEH in benzene-induced toxicity. Male and female mEH-deficient (mEH–/–) mice and background mice (129 /Sv) were ex-posed to inhaled benzene (0, 10, 50, or 100 ppm) 5 days/week, 6 h/day, for a two-week duration. Total white blood cell counts and bone marrow cell counts were used to assess hematotoxicity and <b>myelotoxicity.</b> Micronucleated peripheral blood cells were counted to assess genotoxicity, and the p 21 mRNA level in bone marrow cells was used as a determinant of the p 53 -regulated DNA damage response. Male mEH–/ – mice did not have any significant hemato-toxicity or <b>myelotoxicity</b> at the highest benzene exposure com...|$|E

Rituximab was indicated for refractoriness to standard treatment {{in one case}} and life-threatening <b>myelotoxicity</b> due to alkylating agents in the other. A brief review of previous experience {{with the use of}} rituximab in the treatment of WG is presented...|$|E
40|$|Ticlopidine, {{clopidogrel}} and prasugrel are thienopyridine derivatives {{used for}} inhibition of platelet aggregation in several cardiovascular diseases. Besides hepatotoxicity, also bone marrow toxicity may limit their use. The mechanisms associated with <b>myelotoxicity</b> of thienopyridines are currently unclear. Uncovering the {{mechanism by which}} thienopyridines lead to these adverse effects is therefore of great importance. In this thesis, three different cell systems which include human hematopoietic stem cells isolated from umbilical cord blood, neutrophils isolated from peripheral blood and human promyelocytic leukemia cell line were used. The main aims of this thesis were to investigate whether the mother substance and/or the active metabolites are responsible for <b>myelotoxicity</b> and whether the inactive clopidogrel metabolite clopidogrel carboxylate contributes to <b>myelotoxicity.</b> Apart from the well-known CYP-mediated metabolism of thienopyridines in liver, MPO present in neutrophils also metabolise clopidogrel, ticlopidine, prasugrel, and clopidogrel carboxylate. In contrast, clopidogrel carboxylate was not metabolized by human CYP 3 A 4. MPO-dependant metabolism of clopidogrel, ticlopidine, prasugrel, and clopidogrel carboxylate showed dose dependent cytotoxicity. Similarly, CYP 3 A 4 -mediated metabolism showed dose dependent cytotoxicity of all drugs except clopidogrel carboxylate. Taking into account the pharmacokinetics in humans, we conclude that the myelotoxic principle of clopidogrel is most probably associated with metabolite formation from clopidogrel carboxylate by myeloperoxidase. For ticlopidine and prasugrel the mother substance itself and metabolites formed by myeloperoxidase are myelotoxic. Both mother substance and metabolites formed by MPO or CYP 3 A 4 showed mitochondrial mediated cytotoxicity...|$|E

40|$|A phase 1 - 2 {{trial of}} 90 Y-labelled {{monoclonal}} antibody, HMFG 1 administered intraperitoneally to 30 patients with ovarian carcinoma is presented. The problems encountered with <b>myelotoxicity</b> are described, and the steps which {{have so far}} been taken to overcome this and to increase the dose of 90 Y to an estimated tumouricidal level. Bone deposition of free 90 Y limits the dose which can be administered without severe bone marrow toxicity. The intravenous use of a chelating agent, Ledclair (EDTA) has allowed the dose to be increased from 18 to 30 mCi without causing severe <b>myelotoxicity.</b> 90 Y-DTPA MAb is an unstable immunoconjugate in vivo and in vitro. The use of a more stable linkage such as a macrocycle should enable the administered dose to be increased without {{increasing the amount of}} free 90 Y which becomes available to be deposited in bone. This would be expected to reduce toxicity and increase therapeutic efficacy...|$|E
40|$|<b>Myelotoxicity</b> of {{pesticides}} and algal toxin was detected in vitro {{by using the}} granulocyte-macrophage colony forming unit assay (CFU-GM), and the MTT test with SR- 4987 cells, an established stromal cell line derived from a long term murine bone marrow culture, which may represent a suitable in vitro model for studying haematotoxicity. Comparison of the IC 50 s and NOELs obtained with the CFU-GM assay and those determined by testing the established stromal cells in the MTT cytotoxicity test indicate that inhibition of the proliferation of SR- 4987 stromal cells is a sensitive in vitro endpoint for measuring <b>myelotoxicity.</b> It is suggested that this assay {{could be used as}} rapid and easy sceening test for determining the haematoxicity of environmental toxins. A comparison with results obtained with the MTT test on a non-differentiated cell line, 3 T 3 -L 1, was carried out to distinguish between non-specific interference with cell proliferation and specific toxicity on haemopoietic cells.
