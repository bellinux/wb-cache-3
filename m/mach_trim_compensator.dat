50|$|A <b>Mach</b> <b>trimmer</b> is {{a device}} which varies the pitch trim {{automatically}} {{as a function}} of Mach number to oppose Mach tuck and maintain level flight.|$|R
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was controlled by}} a fighter-type control stick and rudder bar which operated the powered flying controls (PFCs). Each PFC had a single electro-hydraulic powered flying control unit (PFCU) except the rudder which had two, one running as a back-up. Artificial feel and autostabilisation {{in the form of}} pitch and yaw dampers were provided, as well as an auto <b>mach</b> <b>trimmer.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{before there}} were three body styles offered: Hardtop (available in base or Grande trim), Sportsroof (available in base or <b>Mach</b> 1 <b>trim),</b> and {{convertible}} (no specific trim packages available).|$|R
50|$|The {{water was}} only 20 ft deep, yet only 60 {{percent of the}} {{wreckage}} was recovered because the breakup was so extensive. The flight data recorder tape was too damaged to help the investigation. Instead, investigators used the maintenance records of the crashed aircraft and of other DC-8s, {{to conclude that the}} pilots had trimmed the horizontal stabilizer to the full nose-down position, to counter the excessive nose-up attitude that, in turn, was caused by a malfunctioning pitch <b>trim</b> <b>compensator</b> that had extended too far. Once the upset occurred, {{it was not possible to}} trim the horizontal stabilizer back to the nose-up position, because of the severe G-forces generated by the crew's pulling back on the yoke after the upset.|$|R
5000|$|November 1963: Trans-Canada Air Lines Flight 831 - All 118 {{on board}} a Trans-Canada Airlines DC-8-54F were killed, when the plane crashed 5 minutes after takeoff near Montreal, leaving a crater in the ground. Impact speed was over 500 mph. They found the pitch <b>trim</b> <b>compensator</b> {{actuator}} was in the extended position and the horizontal stabilizer trim setting was at 1.65 to 2 degrees nosedown (both were improper positions, for that stage of flight). [...] "The probable cause of this accident could not be determined with certainty. Certain possible causes which were put forward could not be ruled out: 1) Icing of the Pitot system; 2) Failure of the vertical gyro; 3) An unprogrammed and unnoticed extension of the pitch trim compensator." ...|$|R
5000|$|February 1964: Eastern Air Lines Flight 304 - An Eastern Airlines DC-8 {{crashed into}} Lake Pontchartrain about 5 minutes after {{taking off from}} the New Orleans Moisant Airport. All 58 on board perished. The water was only 20 ft. deep, yet only 60% of the {{wreckage}} was recovered, because the breakup was so extensive. The flight data recorder tape was too damaged to help the analysis. Instead, they used the maintenance records of that plane, and of other DC-8s, {{to conclude that the}} pilots had trimmed the stabilizer to the full nose-down position, to counter the excessive nose-up attitude that, in turn, was caused by a malfunctioning pitch <b>trim</b> <b>compensator</b> that had extended too far. Once the upset occurred, {{it was not possible to}} trim the HS back to the nose-up position, because of the severe G-forces generated by their pulling back on the yoke after the upset.|$|R
25|$|Just {{after midnight}} on 2 October, shortly after take-off, the Boeing 757 {{airliner}} crew discovered that their basic flight instruments were behaving erratically and reported receiving contradictory serial emergency {{messages from the}} flight management computer, including rudder ratio, <b>mach</b> speed <b>trim,</b> overspeed, underspeed and flying too low. The crew declared an emergency and requested an immediate return to the airport.|$|R
50|$|At {{transonic}} speeds, {{an aircraft}} can experience a shift rearwards {{in the center}} of pressure due to the buildup and movement of shockwaves. This causes a nose-down pitching moment called <b>Mach</b> tuck. Significant <b>trim</b> force may be needed to maintain equilibrium, and this is most often provided using the whole tailplane rather than a small trim tab, {{in the form of an}} all-flying tailplane or stabilator.|$|R
40|$|Results of {{comparisons}} of predictions of aerodynamic performance, longitudinal trim, and reaction control jet interaction {{with data from}} the initial Shuttle flight are presented. The Shuttle's control surfaces are described, and {{it is noted that}} the flight plan contained no provisions for maneuvering capability tests. Wind tunnel testing totaling 35, 000 hr were used to replace graduated flight testing, and calculations were made to allow for nonsimulated structural deformation, flowfield parameters, and profile drag. The goal was to desensitize the flight control system with respect to the aerodynamics by adding variations to the predictions. Lift/drag agreed well above Mach 1, while lower drag was encountered below <b>Mach</b> 1. <b>Trim</b> characteristics were predicted accurately between Mach 2 - 10, and less than satisfactorily outside that range. Discrepancies were also observed for jet interaction effects for the aft yaw jets at Mach numbers greater than 10...|$|R
40|$|Many {{vehicle design}} studies focus on {{optimizing}} Hypersonic Accelerating Airbreathing vehicles for maximum performance but typically trim {{is not a}} primary concern. Vehicle longitudinal trim is often obtained by using trim elevons resulting in unwanted trim drag. As {{it is difficult to}} obtain high thrust from scramjet engines at high <b>Mach</b> numbers, <b>trim</b> drag reduction is important for accelerating vehicles. This study is based around maximizing the performance of an airbreathing 2 nd stage Winged Cone Vehicle, as part of a three-stage rocket-scramjet-rocket launch system for payload masses of the order of 100 kg. The concept of a minimum trim vehicle is introduced, where it is desired to alter the vehicle planform {{to reduce the amount of}} elevon trim required along the trajectory. It is shown that by including the trajectory and the requirement for the vehicle to be longitudinally trimmed into a multidisciplinary analysis and optimization study the performance of the vehicle can be improved over a conventionally optimized design with post optimization trim...|$|R
40|$|Comparisons {{are made}} between the LAURA Navier-Stokes code and Viking Lander Capsule {{hypersonic}} aerodynamics data from ground and flight measurements. Wind tunnel data are available for a 3. 48 percent scale model at Mach 6 and a 2. 75 percent scale model at Mach 10. 35, both under perfect gas air conditions. Viking Lander 1 aerodynamics flight data also exist from on-board instrumentation for velocities between 2900 and 4400 m/sec (Mach 14 to 23. 3). LAURA flowfield solutions are obtained for the geometry as tested or flown, including sting effects at tunnel conditions and finite-rate chemistry effects in flight. Using the flight vehicle center-of-gravity location (trim angle approx. equals - 11. 1 deg), the computed trim angle at tunnel conditions is within 0. 31 degrees of the angle derived from Mach 6 data and 0. 13 degrees from the <b>Mach</b> 10. 35 <b>trim</b> angle. LAURA <b>Mach</b> 6 <b>trim</b> lift and drag force coefficients are within 2 percent of measured data, and computed trim lift-to-drag ratio is within 4 percent of the data. Computed trim lift and drag force coefficients at Mach 10. 35 are within 5 percent and 3 percent, respectively, of wind tunnel data. Computed trim lift-to-drag ratio is within 2 percent of the Mach 10. 35 data. Using the nominal density profile and center-of-gravity location, LAURA trim angle at flight conditions is within 0. 5 degrees of the total angle measured from on-board instrumentation. LAURA trim lift and drag force coefficients at flight conditions are within 7 and 5 percent, respectively, of the flight data. Computed trim lift-to-drag ratio is within 4 percent of the data. Computed aerodynamics sensitivities to center-of-gravity location, atmospheric density, and grid refinement are generally small. The results will enable a better estimate of aerodynamics uncertainties for future Mars entry vehicles where non-zero angle-of-attack is required...|$|R
40|$|During ﬂutter {{analysis}} of a new aircraft {{a huge number of}} unsteady aerodynamic simulations is necessary in the parameter space consisting of <b>Mach</b> number, aeroelastic <b>trim</b> state, structural mode shape and frequency. For subsonic ﬂow conditions fast potential methods like the Doublet Lattice Method can be applied. In the transonic regime unsteady ﬂow perturbations depend on the mean ﬂow state and CFD methods have to be employed. However, solving the nonlinear unsteady RANS equations for thousands of parameter combinations is not applicable. Hence, faster CFD methods are needed to reduce the computational costs. Assuming small time-harmonic perturbations, the RANS equations can be linearized around the steady mean solution. The latter are preferably solved in the frequency domain. This results in a large, sparse linear system for the perturbation of the ﬂuid unknowns. In this paper an efficient time-linearized solver (LFD-TAU) is presented with special focus on 2 -d external ﬂows with strong shock-induced separation. The results are compared to small-amplitude pulse response and single-frequency RANS simulations, demonstrating good agreement over a wide frequency range. Even under pre-buffet ﬂow conditions, showing aerodynamic resonance peaks, the resonance frequency is captured well, while the amplitudes are overestimated. ...|$|R
40|$|Three NASA centers: Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), Langley Research Center (LaRC), and Johnson Space Center (JSC) are {{currently}} involved in studying {{a family of}} single-stage- and two-stage-to-orbit (SSTO/TSTO) vehicles {{to serve as the}} next generation space transportation system (STS). A rocketed winged-body is the current focus. The configuration (WB 001) is a vertically-launched, horizontally-landing system with circular cross-section. Preliminary aerodynamic data was generated by LaRC and is a combination of wind-tunnel data, empirical methods, and Aerodynamic Preliminary Analysis System-(APAS) generated values. JSC's efforts involve descent trajectory design, stability analysis, and flight control system synthesis. Analysis of WB 001 's static stability indicates instability in 'tuck' (C(sub mu) less than 0 : Mach = 0. 30, alpha greater than 3. 25 deg; Mach = 0. 60, alpha greater than 8. 04), an unstable dihedral effects (C(sub l(beta)) greater than 0 : Mach = 30,alpha less than 12 deg.; Mach = 0. 60, alpha less than 10. 00 deg.), and, most significantly, an unstable weathercock stability derivative, C(sub n(beta)), at all angles of attack and subsonic <b>Mach</b> numbers. Longitudinal <b>trim</b> solutions for <b>Mach</b> = 0. 30 and 0. 60 indicate flight path angle possibilities ranging from around 12 (M = 0. 30) to slightly over 20 degrees at Mach = 0. 60. Trim angles of attack increase from 6. 24 at Mach 0. 60 and 10, 000 feet to 17. 7 deg. at Mach 0. 30, sea-level. Lateral trim was attempted for a design cross-wind of 25. 0 knots. The current vehicle aerodynamic and geometric characteristics will only yield a lateral trim solution at impractical tip-fin deflections (approximately equal to 43 deg.) and bank angles (21 deg.). A study of the lateral control surfaces, tip-fin controllers for WB 001, indicate increased surface area would help address these instabilities, particularly the deficiency in C(sub n(beta)), but obviously at the expense of increased vehicle weight. Growth factors of approximately 7 were determined using a design C(sub n(beta)) of 0. 100 /radian (approximate subsonic values for the orbiter) ...|$|R
