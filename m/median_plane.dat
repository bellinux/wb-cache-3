6000|$|Section 6. We may {{note here}} {{the meaning of}} certain terms we shall be {{constantly}} employing. The head end of the rabbit is anterior, the tail end posterior, the backbone side of the body-- the upper side in life-- is dorsal, the breast and belly side, the lower side of the animal, is ventral. If we imagine the rabbit sawn asunder, as it were, by a plane passing through the head and tail, {{that would be the}} <b>median</b> <b>plane,</b> and parts on either side of it are lateral, and left or right according as they lie to the animal's left or right. In a limb, or in the internal organs, the part nearest the central organ, or axis, is proximal, the more remote or terminal parts are distal. For instance, the mouth is anteriorly placed, the tongue on its ventral wall; the tongue is median, the eyes are lateral, and the fingers are distal to the elbow. The student must accustom himself to these words, and avoid, in his descriptions, the use of such terms as [...] "above," [...] "below," [...] "outside," [...] which vary with the position in which we conceive the animal placed.|$|E

The optical elements of mechanically symmetrical lenses, and, either unipotential, or electrically asymmetrical ones, have been computed. The results agree very well with those obtained by Read by means of the charge distribution method. The influence of the mechanical asymmetry on the optical properties has also been studied, and an important property has been pointed out : the optical properties depend essentially on the distance between the <b>median</b> <b>planes</b> of the two gaps and very little on the lengths of these gaps...|$|R

In {{the absence}} of a well suited measure for {{quantifying}} binaural data variations, this study presents the use of a global perceptual distance metric which can describe both HRTF as well as listener similarities. The metric is derived based on subjective evaluations of binaural renderings of a sound moving along predefined trajectories in the horizontal and <b>median</b> <b>planes.</b> Its characteristics and advantages in describing data distributions based on perceptually relevant attributes are discussed. In addition, the use of 24 HRTFs from two different databases of origin allows for an evaluation of the perceptual impact of some database-dependent characteristics on spatialization. The effectiveness of the experimental design as well as the correlation between the HRTF evaluations of the two plane trajectories are also discussed...|$|R

The RTM end magnets are two-sector magnets tilted in their <b>median</b> <b>planes,</b> to provide strong focusing forces for optimal electron-optical properties. Closed-orbit conditions are fulfilled with the help of small correction dipoles located in the RTM drift space; the magnetic-field strengths of these correction dipoles are adjusted on the basis of beam-position measurements.

40|$|In {{binaural}} synthesis {{a virtual}} sound source is implemented by convolving an anechoic signal {{with a pair}} of head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). In order to represent all possible directions of the sound source with respect to the listener a discrete number of HRTFs are measured and interpolations are made in between. A listening experiment was done to estimate the lowest directional resolution with which HRTFs have to be measured to ensure that interpolations between them do not introduce audible errors. In order to make this study the HRTFs of an artificial head were measured with a directional resolution of 2 °. The measurements were used to create HRTF data sets with low resolution from which interpolations were made in the horizontal, frontal, and <b>median</b> <b>planes.</b> Measured and interpolated HRTFs were compared in a three-alternative forced-choice listening experiment for both stationary and moving sound sources. A criterion was found that predicts the experimental results.

40|$|Background: Surgical {{repair of}} pectus excavatum (PE) {{has become more}} popular due to {{improvements}} in the minimally invasive Nuss procedure. The pre-surgical assessment of PE patients requires Computerized Tomography (CT), as the malformation characteristics vary from patient to patient. Objective: This work aims to characterize soft tissue thickness (STT) external to the ribs among PE patients. It also presents a comparative analysis between the anterior chest wall surface before and after surgical correction. Methods: Through surrounding tissue segmentation in CT data, STT values were calculated at different lines along the thoracic wall, with a reference point in the intersection of coronal and <b>median</b> <b>planes.</b> The comparative analysis between the two 3 D anterior chest surfaces sets a surgical correction influence area (SCIA) and a volume of interest (VOI) based on image processing algorithms, 3 D surface algorithms, and registration methods. Results: There are always variations between left and right side STTs (2. 54 ± 2. 05 mm and 2. 95 ± 2. 97 mm for female and male patients, respectively). STTs are dependent on age, sex, and body mass index of each patient. On female patients, breast tissue induces additional errors in bar manua...|$|R
