5|$|While {{maintenance}} {{issues and}} not the actual design of the aircraft were ultimately found responsible for the crash, the accident and subsequent grounding of all DC-10s by the Federal Aviation Administration added to an already unfavorable reputation of the DC-10 aircraft {{in the eyes of}} the public, caused by several other incidents and accidents involving the type. The investigation also revealed other DC-10s with damage caused by the same faulty <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedure.</b> The faulty procedure was banned, and the aircraft type went on to have a long career as a passenger and cargo aircraft. In response to this accident, American Airlines was fined $500,000 by the U.S. government for improper maintenance procedures.|$|E
25|$|On 4 April 2011, a fire {{broke out}} on a Di 8 {{locomotive}} at Kl√∏fta on the Trunk Line while hauling a 16-wagon train of jet fuel to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. The fire started in an electrical cabinet after a diesel pipe running over it had cracked. The fire fighting was complicated by the train dispatcher not wanting to disconnect the overhead wire power as {{he thought it was}} an electric train. The damages were so severe that the locomotive was scrapped. The Accident Investigation Board Norway criticized CargoNet for not having sufficient maintenance routines for diesel pipes, as they were neither part of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedure</b> nor where there specified intervals for replacement.|$|E
25|$|It {{was water}} hammer {{that caused the}} {{physical}} damage to the reactor, the deaths of personnel who stood atop and nearby, {{and the release of}} radioactive isotopes to the environment. One of the lessons learned from SL-1 was that there is an extreme water hammer hazard whenever a shutdown reactor is cooled to room temperature and there is an air gap between the top of the water and the reactor vessel head. One of the recommendations in the analysis of the incident was that shutdown reactors be filled to the top with water so that a power excursion could not induce such a powerful water hammer. Air is not dense enough to appreciably slow water, while water (being nearly incompressible) is able to distribute explosive forces and limit peak pressure. The extra water is also a very effective radiation shield for those who are directly above the vessel. Written procedures at SL-1 had included a directive to pump down the level of water in the reactor prior to the <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedure</b> that destroyed it.|$|E

50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{officials}} {{discovered that}} a <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedure</b> was the cause. American Airlines mechanics had removed the engine and its pylon as a unit, rather than removing the engine from the pylon then removing the pylon from the wing, as recommended by McDonnell Douglas. The faulty procedure was done using a forklift which resulted in inadvertent structural damage. It was subsequently discovered that this short-cut procedure, believed to save many man-hours on maintenance, was being used by three major airlines, although McDonnell Douglas had advised against it. In November 1979, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) fined American Airlines $500,000 for using this faulty <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedure.</b> Continental Airlines was similarly fined $100,000.|$|E

Personnel matters, problem specification and identification, <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedures,</b> health and safety issues, and quality control issues {{are discussed}} in terms of their influence in effectively carrying out required maintenance. The work described in the thesis demonstrates that several research methods are applicable to, and effective for, gathering information on avionics systems maintenance. Evidence is presented to support the view that research of <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedures</b> can produce considerable benefits in terms of improved overall maintenance performance. A critical comparison of <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedures</b> used by British Aerospace and the Indonesian Air Force is included, and conclusions are drawn which highlight a number of significant possibilities for developing improved procedures. Specific recommendations for improving maintenance productivity are given, and the benefits of addressing issues of Continuing Professional Development, Health and Safety matters, problem identification, use of computer databases, particularly for information governed by Standards, are discussed...|$|R

The minimum acceptable value of resistance for a product to pass an insulation resistance test is 1 megohm (1000 kŒ©).

50|$|The Red Team {{began their}} work about 7 am EDT on Tuesday 12 April 1994.

40|$|We {{have begun}} {{work on an}} {{intelligent}} support tool (SMART) for operating and <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedures.</b> This work extends McDonnell Douglas's recent success in developing electronic job aids for onboard applications.

SMART guides the astronauts through detailed operating and <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedures.</b> It also helps the astronauts decide when {{and how it is}} safe to deviate from the established procedures. SMART's user interface presents the sequential and procedural views of the procedures to the astronauts. The views are supplemented with vivid color graphics of internal system functions, digitized photographs of flight hardware, and full-motion video. SMART also allows the astronauts to keep their own personal notes attached to a procedure. SMART will be delivered on portable hand-held systems. SMART provides highly descriptive, realistic, 'hands-on' training which is available 'on-demand' wherever and whenever it it needed...|$|R
