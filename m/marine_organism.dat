The structure assigned in 1991 to the antibiotic isolated from a <b>marine</b> <b>organism,</b> diazonamide A (C40H34Cl2N6O6, molar mass 765.65 g/mol), proved to be incorrect by the classical proof of structure: a synthetic sample was not identical to the natural product. [...] The mistake was attributed to the inability of X-ray crystallography to distinguish between the correct -OH / >NH and the interchanged -NH2 / -O- groups in the incorrect structure. With advances in instrumentation, however, it is now routinely possible to distinguish between such similar groups using modern single-crystal X-ray diffractometers.|$|E

40|$|Marine {{environment}} {{has been the}} source of diverse life forms that produce different biologically active compounds. <b>Marine</b> <b>organisms</b> are consistently contributing with unparalleled bioactive compounds that have profound applications in nutraceuticals, cosmeceuticals, and pharmaceuticals. In this process, screening of natural products from <b>marine</b> <b>organisms</b> that could potentially inhibit the expression of metalloproteinases has gained a huge popularity, which became a hot field of research in life sciences. Metalloproteinases, especially, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a class of structurally similar enzymes that contribute to the extracellular matrix degradation and play major role in normal and pathological tissue remodeling. Imbalance in the expression of MMPs leads to severe pathological condition that could initiate cardiac, cartilage, and cancer-related diseases. Three decades of endeavor for designing potent matrix metalloproteinase inhibitory substances (MMPIs) with many not making upto final clinical trials seek new resources for devising MMPIs. Umpteen number of medicinally valuable compounds being reported from <b>marine</b> <b>organisms,</b> which encourage current researchers to screen potent MMPIs from <b>marine</b> <b>organisms.</b> In this paper, we have made an attempt to report the metalloproteinase inhibiting substances from various <b>marine</b> <b>organisms...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review is twofold. The first {{objective}} is to summarize OC residue levels in the waters, sediments and <b>marine</b> <b>organisms</b> - specifically fish, crustaceans, and bivalves - along the Asian coastline. The second objective is to summarize some of the possible toxilogical effects induced by OC contamination in those <b>marine</b> <b>organisms</b> and in humans. It is important to narrow the broad list down to a select few compounds that seemed important regarding the selected region. Target compounds for this review are dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites dichlorodiphenylchloroethane (DDE) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD), hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), which include its isomers (α, β, ∂, and γ (lindane)), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB). These chemicals have been used extensively in the Asian region and were found in numerous articles that focused on residual concentrations in <b>marine</b> <b>organisms,</b> bioaccumulation and/or biomagnification properties, and/or the effects {{they may or may}} not have on <b>marine</b> <b>organisms</b> and humans...|$|R
