5|$|Frank was autopsied twice, {{the second}} time to recover debris {{embedded}} in his body. The autopsy revealed that his lower extremities had been ripped off; his muscle tissue was extensively mutilated and torn; small pieces of wire, brass, and <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>articles</b> including a hat ornament were imbedded in various limbs; {{the fingers of his}} right hand were fractured and the bones splintered; and the distal phalanx of each finger on his left hand were missing. The coroner also observed numerous patches of blackened areas, similar to close-range gunshot residue. Four human finger bones were discovered among the wreckage at the primary crash site.|$|E
5|$|As his musings {{developed}} {{along these}} lines, Hazlitt continued to contribute <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>articles</b> to various periodicals. In February 1816, he reviewed August Wilhelm Schlegel's Lectures on Dramatic Literature for the Edinburgh Review. The German critic Schlegel showed {{an appreciation for}} Shakespeare of a kind {{that no one in}} Hazlitt's country had yet demonstrated, and Hazlitt, sympathising with many of Schlegel's ideas, felt there was a place for a whole book that would provide appreciative criticism of all of Shakespeare's plays. Such a book would provide liberal quotations from the text, and focus on the characters and various qualities particular to each play; and he felt that he could write it. His writing career was now moving in this direction (he had been contributing miscellaneous literary criticism to the Examiner and elsewhere during this period), he needed the money to support his family, and his growing reputation as a drama critic enabled him to have his name appear on the title page (as a reviewer for periodicals, his contributions were anonymous, as was customary at the time).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{employs a}} {{stochastic}} frontier (SFA) and {{data envelopment analysis}} (DEA) to analyse inefficiency effect models for 3, 894 Thai manufacturing and exporting small and medium size enterprises (SMEs), using 2007 Thai Industrial Census data. Thai manufacturing and exporting SMEs experience decreasing returns to scale even though their technical efficiency in production {{is found to be}} relatively high. Results from estimations using both approaches also reveal that firm age, medium-sized enterprises compared with small-sized enterprises, firm location in Bangkok, foreign investment and government assistance are significantly and positively related to firm technical efficiency. Focusing on the technical efficiency of SMEs exporting to different destinations, those exporting to OCEANIA perform the best, followed by SMEs exporting to ASEAN, East Asia, and North and South America, while SMEs exporting to Europe experience no significant effect upon their technical efficiency from doing so, where SMEs exporting {{to the rest of the}} world is the base exporting SME group. The results also reveal that SMEs in the chemicals and related products sector perform the best, followed by SMEs in the machinery and transport equipment sector, where the <b>miscellaneous</b> manufactured <b>articles</b> sector is used as the base sector. The manufactured goods sector and food, beverages and tobacco sector are also found to perform better than the <b>miscellaneous</b> manufactured <b>articles</b> sector. Finally, the paper also provides useful evidence-based policy recommendations aimed at enhancing the technical efficiency and competitiveness of Thai manufacturing and exporting SMEs...|$|R
