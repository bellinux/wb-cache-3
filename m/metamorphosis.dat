Zimmerman's finished work, <b>Metamorphoses,</b> was produced in 1998. Of the many stories told in Zimmerman's <b>Metamorphoses,</b> only the introductory [...] "Cosmogony" [...] and the tale of Phaeton are from the first half of Ovid's <b>Metamorphoses.</b> The story of Eros and Psyche is not a part of Ovid's Metamorphoses; it is from Lucius Apuleius' novel <b>Metamorphoses</b> —also called The Golden Ass—and was included in Zimmerman's <b>Metamorphoses</b> because, as Zimmerman {{said in an interview with}} Bill Moyers of PBS NOW, [...] "I love it so much I just had to put it in."

5|$|Some of {{the oldest}} and most {{successful}} insect groups, such Endopterygota, use a system of complete <b>metamorphosis.</b> Complete <b>metamorphosis</b> is unique to a group of certain insect orders including Diptera, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera.

5|$|His {{first study}} of {{mathematics}} began with papers by George Pólya {{and by the}} crystallographer Friedrich Haag on plane symmetry groups, sent {{to him by his}} brother Berend, a geologist. He carefully studied the 17 wallpaper groups, and created periodic tilings with 43 drawings of different types of symmetry. From this point on he developed a mathematical approach to expressions of symmetry in his art works using his own notation. Starting in 1937, he created woodcuts based on the 17 groups. His <b>Metamorphosis</b> I (1937) began a series of designs that told a story through the use of pictures. In <b>Metamorphosis</b> I, he transformed convex polygons into regular patterns in a plane to form a human motif. He extended the approach in his piece <b>Metamorphosis</b> III, which is four metres long.|$|E

5|$|Most {{amphibians}} {{go through}} <b>metamorphosis,</b> {{a process of}} significant morphological change after birth. In typical amphibian development, eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle. Frogs, toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as larvae with external gills. <b>Metamorphosis</b> in amphibians is regulated by thyroxine concentration in the blood, which stimulates <b>metamorphosis,</b> and prolactin, which counteracts thyroxine's effect. Specific events are dependent on threshold values for different tissues. Because most embryonic development is outside the parental body, it is subject to many adaptations due to specific environmental circumstances. For this reason tadpoles can have horny ridges instead of teeth, whisker-like skin extensions or fins. They also make use of a sensory lateral line organ {{similar to that of}} fish. After <b>metamorphosis,</b> these organs become redundant and will be reabsorbed by controlled cell death, called apoptosis. The variety of adaptations to specific environmental circumstances among amphibians is wide, with many discoveries still being made.|$|E

5|$|Beetles {{are members}} of the {{superorder}} Endopterygota, and accordingly most of them undergo complete <b>metamorphosis.</b> The typical form of <b>metamorphosis</b> in beetles passes through four main stages: the egg, the larva, the pupa, and the imago or adult. The larvae are commonly called grubs and the pupa sometimes is called the chrysalis. In some species, the pupa may be enclosed in a cocoon constructed by the larva towards the end of its final instar. Some beetles, such as typical members of the families Meloidae and Rhipiphoridae, go further, undergoing hypermetamorphosis in which the first instar {{takes the form of a}} triungulin.|$|E

5|$|Cockroaches have {{incomplete}} <b>metamorphosis,</b> {{meaning that}} the nymphs are generally similar to the adults, except for undeveloped wings and genitalia.

5000|$|The <b>Metamorphoses</b> {{was also}} a {{considerable}} influence on William Shakespeare. His Romeo and Juliet {{is influenced by the}} story of Pyramus and Thisbe (<b>Metamorphoses</b> Book IV); and, in A Midsummer Night's Dream, a band of amateur actors performs a play about Pyramus and Thisbe. [...] Shakespeare's early erotic poem Venus and Adonis expands on the myth in Book X of the <b>Metamorphoses.</b> In Titus Andronicus, the story of Lavinia's rape is drawn from Tereus' rape of Philomela, and the text of the <b>Metamorphoses</b> is used within the play to enable Titus to interpret his daughter's story. Most of Prospero's renunciative speech in Act V of The Tempest is taken word-for-word from a speech by Medea in Book VII of the <b>Metamorphoses.</b> Among other English writers for whom the <b>Metamorphoses</b> was an inspiration are John Milton—who made use of it in Paradise Lost, considered his magnum opus, and evidently knew it well—and Edmund Spenser. In Europe, the poem was an influence on Giovanni Boccaccio (the story of Pyramus and Thisbe appears in his poem L'Amorosa Fiammetta) and Dante.|$|R
5|$|Termites {{are among}} the most {{successful}} groups of insects on Earth, colonising most landmasses except for Antarctica. Their colonies range in size from a few hundred individuals to enormous societies with several million individuals. Termite queens have the longest lifespan of any insect in the world, with some queens reportedly living up to 30 to 50 years. Unlike ants, which undergo a complete <b>metamorphosis,</b> each individual termite goes through an incomplete <b>metamorphosis</b> that proceeds through egg, nymph, and adult stages. Colonies are described as superorganisms because the termites form part of a self-regulating entity: the colony itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycles}} of insects vary but most hatch from eggs. Insect growth is {{constrained}} by the inelastic exoskeleton and development involves a series of molts. The immature stages can differ from the adults in structure, habit and habitat, and can include a passive pupal stage in those groups that undergo four-stage <b>metamorphosis</b> (see holometabolism). Insects that undergo three-stage <b>metamorphosis</b> lack a pupal stage and adults develop {{through a series of}} nymphal stages. The higher level relationship of the Hexapoda is unclear. Fossilized insects of enormous size have been found from the Paleozoic Era, including giant dragonflies with wingspans of 55 to 70cm (22–28in). The most diverse insect groups appear to have coevolved with flowering plants.|$|E

By 1953 the British sf market was going through a <b>metamorphosis</b> similar to the one going in the US at the same time: poor quality sf markets were failing, and the result was a reduced but active market, with four magazines: Authentic, New Worlds, Science Fantasy, and Nebula Science Fiction.|$|E

As a whole, his games {{are not of}} particular fame, although they have some unique elements that set them apart from mainstream games.

5|$|Although toads {{are usually}} solitary animals, in the {{breeding}} season, {{large numbers of}} toads converge on certain breeding ponds, where the males compete to mate with the females. Eggs are laid in gelatinous strings {{in the water and}} later hatch out into tadpoles. After several months of growth and development, these sprout limbs and undergo <b>metamorphosis</b> into tiny toads. The juveniles emerge from the water and remain largely terrestrial {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E
5|$|Holometabolism, or {{complete}} <b>metamorphosis,</b> {{is where the}} insect changes in four stages, an egg or embryo, a larva, a pupa and the adult or imago. In these species, an egg hatches to produce a larva, which is generally worm-like in form. This worm-like form {{can be one of}} several varieties: eruciform (caterpillar-like), scarabaeiform (grub-like), campodeiform (elongated, flattened and active), elateriform (wireworm-like) or vermiform (maggot-like). The larva grows and eventually becomes a pupa, a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a cocoon. There are three types of pupae: obtect, exarate or coarctate. Obtect pupae are compact, with the legs and other appendages enclosed. Exarate pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended. Coarctate pupae develop inside the larval skin. Insects undergo considerable change in form during the pupal stage, and emerge as adults. Butterflies are a well-known example of insects that undergo complete <b>metamorphosis,</b> although most insects use this life cycle. Some insects have evolved this system to hypermetamorphosis.|$|E
