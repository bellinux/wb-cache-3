Characteristics of interest include surface morphology, surface roughness, and surface hardness in the <b>melted</b> <b>zone</b> {{as well as the}} size of the <b>melted</b> <b>zone.</b> For this study, the proper pulse energy for inducing surface melting at one shot is selected using numerical simulations that calculate the variation in temperature at the laser beam spot for various input pulse energies in order to find the proper pulse energy for raising the temperature to the melting point.

5000|$|The concept {{involves}} drilling a borehole about 5 km {{down into}} the Earth's crust. High level waste, like spent nuclear fuel, would be sealed in strong steel containers and lowered down the borehole, filling the bottom one or two kilometers of the hole. Current technology limits {{the diameter of the}} borehole to less than 50 centimeters. This means that some waste currently stored in large containers would need to be repackaged in smaller containers. The rest of the borehole is then sealed with appropriate materials, including clay, cement, crushed rock backfill, and asphalt, to ensure a low-permeability barrier between the waste and the land surface. In some concepts, waste may be surrounded by cementitious grout or a highly compacted bentonite buffer matrix to provide improved containment and to reduce the effect of rock movement on the canisters' integrity. A high-temperature scenario involves very young hot waste in the containers which releases enough heat to create a <b>melt</b> <b>zone</b> around the borehole. As the waste decays and cools, the <b>melt</b> <b>zone</b> resolidifies, forming a solid granite sarcophagus around the containers, entombing the waste forever. [...] Under both scenarios, chemically reducing conditions adjacent to the borehole will reduce the transport of most radionuclides.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of melting in the Hawaiian plume using a 3 D variable-viscosity convection model outfitted with a melting parameterization that permits calculation of the local melting rate {{and the distribution of}} buoyant depleted residual material. From a suite of 45 steady-state numerical experiments, we derive complete scaling laws for the total rate of melting M and the height H and width W of the topographic swell as functions of the lithospheric thickness zl and the plume's maximum potential temperature θi, thermal buoyancy flux B, and minimum viscosity ηp. Assuming 1500 °C<θi< 1600 °C, the observed values of M, H and W can only be matched if zl≤ 89 km, 2200 kg s− 1 ≤B≤ 3500 kg s− 1, and ηp≥ 5 × 1017 Pas. We study a reference Hawaiian model satisfying these constraints. The depletion anomaly is narrower than the thermal anomaly, and carries 24 % of the total (thermal plus depletion) buoyancy flux. Its buoyancy contributes 350 m of the uplift along the swell axis, and reduces the geoid/topography ratio by 16 % relative to a model without depletion buoyancy. All the material that melts comes from the hottest central part of the plume, and no direct melting of the asthenosphere or lithosphere occurs. Melting occurs both in a primary <b>melting</b> <b>zone</b> above the plume stem and in a weaker secondary <b>melting</b> <b>zone</b> 300 – 500 km downstream, separated by an interval where no melting occurs.
