5|$|Garfield lingered for two-and-a-half {{months before}} dying on September 19, 1881. Vice President Chester A. Arthur, the New York Stalwart, {{was sworn in}} as {{president}} that night. Garfield's murder by a spoilsman inspired the nation to reform the civil service—and Arthur, erstwhile member of the Conkling machine, joined the cause. In 1883, a bipartisan <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> passed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act to reform the worst of the office-seeking system, and Arthur signed the measure into law.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 1993, Clinton {{made a major}} {{speech to}} Congress {{regarding}} a health care reform plan; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. This {{was one of the}} most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the American Medical Association, and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer John F. Harris stated that the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the White House. Despite the Democratic <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress,</b> the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by George J. Mitchell failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration.|$|E
5|$|The Front for Victory {{recovered}} {{the majority in}} both chambers of the Congress during the 2011 presidential elections, when Cristina Kirchner was re-elected for a second term. The party had projects to amend the constitution and allow indefinite reelections, but lacked the supermajority required for it. A victory at the 2013 midterm elections would have given such majority, but the party was defeated in most provinces. Sergio Massa, a former cabinet minister of the Kirchners, won in the Buenos Aires Province by nearly 10 points with his new party, the Renewal Front. Argentina lacked a big opposition party {{since the collapse of}} the Radical Civic Union in 2001. Instead, Massa created an alternative party that also stood for Peronism. However, the party still retained a simple <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress.</b> This election was the first one where teenagers from 16 to 18 could vote. President Kirchner, who had undergone brain surgery some weeks before, was hospitalized during the election and unable to join the campaign.|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} {{the extent to}} which partisan <b>majorities</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> influence economic policy, we compare financial market responses in recent midterm elections to Presidential elections. We use prediction markets that track election outcomes as a means of precisely timing and calibrating the arrival of news, allowing substantially more precise estimates than a traditional event study methodology. We find that equity values, oil prices, and Treasury yields are slightly higher with Republican <b>majorities</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress,</b> and that a switch <b>in</b> the <b>majority</b> party <b>in</b> a chamber of Congress has an impact that is only 10 - 30 percent of that of the Presidency. We also find evidence inconsistent with the popular view that divided government is better for equities, finding instead that equity valuations increase monotonically, albeit slightly, with the degree of Republican control...|$|R
5|$|Throughout {{his career}} as a senator, Hugo L Black would give speeches based on his belief in the {{ultimate}} power of the Constitution. He came to see the actions of the anti-New Deal Supreme Court as judicial excess; in his view, the Court was improperly overturning legislation that had been passed by large <b>majorities</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress.</b>|$|R
50|$|VAWA was reauthorized by {{bipartisan}} <b>majorities</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>in</b> 2000, {{and again}} in December 2005, and signed by President George W. Bush. The Act's 2012 renewal was opposed by conservative Republicans, who objected to extending the Act's protections to same-sex couples and to provisions allowing battered illegal immigrants to claim temporary visas. Ultimately, VAWA was again reauthorized in 2013, after a long legislative battle throughout 2012-2013.|$|R

500|$|While Republicans were discouraged, Democrats were {{energized}} and did {{especially well}} in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and New York. The Republicans did maintain their <b>majorities</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> and <b>in</b> the major states, except New York.

5000|$|In the 1866 elections, the Radical Republicans won two-thirds <b>majorities</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> {{and took}} control of {{national}} affairs. The large Republican majorities made Congressional Democrats helpless, though they unanimously opposed the Radicals' Reconstruction policies. Realizing that the old issues were holding it back, the Democrats tried a [...] "New Departure" [...] that downplayed the War and stressed such issues as corruption and white supremacy.|$|R
25|$|Until the Affordable Healthcare for America Act, a {{combination}} of factors kept health care {{off the top of the}} agenda. For example, politicians were not eager to confront the forces that successfully frustrated the Clinton effort, health maintenance organizations were able to limit cost increases to some extent, and a conservative Republican <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> or a conservative Republican president was in power or in office.|$|E
25|$|President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was re-elected in 2011. As the Constitution of Argentina {{does not}} allow more than two {{consecutive}} terms, several politicians from the Front for Victory (FPV) speculated about {{a constitutional amendment to}} allow unlimited re-elections. This idea was heavily resisted by the opposition parties, and the FPV could not reach the required two-thirds <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress.</b> The mid-term elections in 2013 ended the FPV's hope for a constitutional amendment after they failed to win the necessary supermajority.|$|E
25|$|During his {{freshman}} year, Boehner {{was a member}} of the Gang of Seven which was involved in bringing media attention to the House banking scandal. The group also investigated the Congressional Post Office, leading to the indictment of Congressman Dan Rostenkowski. Later, he, along with Newt Gingrich and several other Republican lawmakers, was one of the engineers of the Contract with America in 1994 that politically helped Republicans during the 1994 congressional elections during which they won the <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> for the first time in four decades.|$|E

25|$|The law has aroused further controversy, {{given that}} in its passing through the {{chambers}} of the legislature, the mandatory seven-day period between debate and assent of the new legislation was ignored.

5000|$|Republicans {{had only}} a two-vote <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> the 108th <b>Congress,</b> so {{they were in a}} weak {{position}} to implement this procedural maneuver. Things changed by 2005 due to the 2004 elections. President Bush won re-election, and the Republicans gained three Senate seats for a 55-45 <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> the 109th <b>Congress,</b> so the [...] "nuclear option" [...] became a more viable strategy.|$|R
25|$|Fasanella's 5-foot by 10-foot painting, Lawrence 1912: The Great Strike (also titled Bread and Roses - Lawrence, 1912) was {{purchased}} by donations from 15 labor unions and the AFL-CIO. It was loaned to the United States Congress, where it hung for years in the Rayburn Office Building in the hearing room of the House Subcommittee on Labor and Education. Following the 1994 elections, a staffer for the new Republican <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> had the painting removed from the hearing room {{and returned to the}} owners. The work now hangs at the Labor Museum and Learning Center in Flint, Michigan.|$|E
25|$|Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code allows {{an income}} tax credit of 2.3 cents/kilowatt-hour (as {{adjusted}} for inflation for 2013) {{for the production of}} electricity from utility-scale wind turbines, geothermal, solar, hydropower, biomass and marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy plants. This incentive, the renewable energy Production Tax Credit (PTC), was created under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (at the value of 1.5 cents/kilowatt-hour, which has since been adjusted annually for inflation). In late 2015 a large <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> voted to extend the PTC for wind and solar power for 5 years and $25 billion. Analysts expect $35 billon of investment for each type.|$|E
25|$|On 17 May 2016, President of Mexico Enrique Peña Nieto {{announced}} he had signed an initiative to amend Article 4 of the Mexican Constitution, which would legalise same-sex marriage nationwide. Any {{amendment to the}} Constitution requires support {{of at least a}} two-thirds <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> and ratification from a simple majority of the 31 states. He also submitted a bill to make appropriate changes in the Civil Code. Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Issues of the Chamber of Deputies, Daniel Ordoñez, announced in June 2016 that the president's initiative will be debated within the committee later in the year. Ordoñez also said that 47,000 letters expressing opposition to the initiative were received though none of them were signed. On 9 November 2016, the committee rejected the initiative 19 votes to 8.|$|E

50|$|The ailing President Quintana's {{death in}} 1906 was the {{beginning}} of the end of Roca's dominance of national politics and policy. Moderate opposition to the PAN had greatly eroded its <b>majorities</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress,</b> the very day the president died, and within months, Bartolomé Mitre and Carlos Pellegrini were dead, as well. President José Figueroa Alcorta defied Roca by signing many of Congressman Palacios' labor law reform bills and by 1909, Figueroa Alcorta was poised to nominate the reformist who had been turned away in 1892: Roque Sáenz Peña.|$|R
5000|$|Riding {{a wave of}} {{approval}} during a dramatic economic recovery from a 2001-02 crisis, the Kirchners' FPV enjoyed increasingly large <b>majorities</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress,</b> reaching a peak at the 2007 general elections (153 Congressmen and 44 Senators). However, soon after, on July 16, 2008, a presidentially sponsored bill to increase Argentina's export taxes {{on the basis of}} a sliding scale met with a legislative deadlock, and was ultimately defeated by the tie-breaking [...] "against" [...] vote of Vice President Julio Cobos. That controversial law cost the FPV 16 Congressmen and 4 Senators by way of defections.|$|R
25|$|After ruling Mexico {{for most}} of the past century, the return of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) brought hope to the {{supporters}} and fear to those remembering the old PRI tactics of making deals with the cartels in exchange for relative peace. According to an article published by The Economist on 23 June 2012, part of the reason why Peña Nieto and the PRI won lies in the disappointment of the rule of the National Action Party (PAN). Buffeted by China's economic growth and the economic recession in the United States, the annual growth of Mexico's economy between 2000 and 2012 was of 1.8%. Poverty worsened, and without a ruling <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress,</b> the PAN presidents were unable to pass structural reforms, leaving monopolies and Mexico's educational system unchanged. In 2006, Felipe Calderón chose to make the battle against organized crime the centerpiece of his presidency. Nonetheless, with over 60,000 dead, many Mexican citizens are tired of a fight they had first supported.|$|E
500|$|When {{it came to}} {{political}} plans for the post-war nation, he was strictly opposed to most Republican-proposed measures. [...] Republicans proposed the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1865, which would abolish slavery, and Randall spoke against it. Claiming opposition to slavery, Randall said his objections stemmed instead from {{a belief that the}} amendment was [...] "a beginning of changes in the Constitution and the forerunner of usurpation." [...] After Andrew Johnson became president following Lincoln's assassination, Randall came to support Johnson's policies for Reconstruction of the defeated South, which were more lenient than those of the Republican <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress.</b> In 1867, the Republicans proposed requiring an ironclad oath from all Southerners wishing to vote, hold office, or practice law in federal courts, making them swear they had never borne arms against the United States. Randall led a 16-hour filibuster against the measure; in spite of his efforts, it passed.|$|E
500|$|Efforts to {{compromise}} failed, {{and a political}} war ensued between the united Republicans on one side, and on the other, Johnson and his allies in the Democratic Party, North and South. He called a convention of the National Union Party. Republicans had returned to using their previous identifier; Johnson intended to use the discarded name to unite his supporters and gain election to a full-term, in 1868. The battleground was the election of 1866; Southern states {{were not allowed to}} vote. Johnson campaigned vigorously, undertaking a public speaking tour, known as the [...] "Swing Around the Circle". The trip, including speeches in Chicago, St. Louis, Indianapolis and Columbus, proved politically disastrous, with the President making controversial comparisons between himself and Christ, and engaging in arguments with hecklers. These exchanges were attacked as beneath the dignity of the presidency. The Republicans won by a landslide, increasing their two-thirds <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress,</b> and made plans to control Reconstruction. Johnson blamed the Democrats for giving only lukewarm support to the National Union movement.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Rachel Lahela Kekoa Bolt, a native Hawaiian heir of Henry Maui, {{and some of}} her {{descendants}} filed federal lawsuits claiming her inherited interest in Palmyra and challenging the legality of the Newlands Resolution that annexed Hawaii in 1898 by simple <b>majorities</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> (after an Annexation Treaty had failed to get the required two-thirds <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. Senate). The lawsuits challenged American sovereignty over both the State of Hawaii and the United States Territory of Palmyra Island. [...] On similar grounds they intervened in a federal marine salvage claim for a sunken treasure ship at Palmyra. [...] The cases were dismissed on procedural grounds before trial.|$|R
2500|$|Even {{if there}} were to be western states, a House {{representation}} of 40,000 might be too small, too easy for the westerners. [...] "States" [...] had been declared out west already. They called themselves republics, and set up their own courts directly from the people without colonial charters. In Transylvania, Westsylvania, Franklin, and Vandalia, [...] "legislatures" [...] met with emissaries from British and Spanish Empires in violation of the Articles of Confederation, just as the sovereign states had done. In the Constitution as written, no <b>majorities</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> could break up the larger states without their consent.|$|R
5000|$|Born in Ramallo, Buenos Aires, Solano Lima {{joined the}} Popular Conservative Party while {{enrolled}} in the University of La Plata. He earned a law degree in 1921 and became a provincial legislator in 1925, serving in the Lower House of the Argentine Congress on two occasions as a center-right National Democratic Party member. Solano Lima purchased an ailing San Nicolás de los Arroyos newspaper, El Norte, in 1928. Becoming a market leader in northeastern Buenos Aires Province (an area which also includes Ramallo), El Norte became a forum for the National Democrats, who enjoyed <b>majorities</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> {{during most of the}} 1930s.|$|R
500|$|In 1846, the United States {{entered the}} Mexican–American War {{in an attempt}} to gain control of Texas. Crittenden did not support the war, and after war was declared, he insisted that commissioners {{accompany}} the U.S. armies and attempt to broker peace at every opportunity. Throughout the war, he corresponded regularly with Generals Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott. Crittenden's sons, George and Thomas, both served in the war; Thomas Crittenden served on Scott's staff. President Polk consulted Crittenden regarding the terms of peace that should be accepted to end the war. Crittenden insisted that the terms of peace should not include the acquisition of territory to which the United States did not have a [...] "just claim", but the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo submitted to Congress in 1848 called for Mexico to give up not only its claims to Texas, but also to New Mexico, California, and all the territory in between. A few Whigs joined the Democratic <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> to ratify the treaty and defeat the Wilmot Proviso, which would have banned slavery in the newly acquired territory.|$|E
500|$|While the Democratic-Republicans had {{supported}} states' rights, {{in the wake}} of the War of 1812 many members urged a stronger central government. A <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> wanted to see the federal government help to fund internal improvements such as ports and roadways. Tyler held fast to his strict constructionist beliefs, rejecting such proposals on both constitutional and personal grounds. He believed each state should construct necessary projects within its borders using locally generated funds. Virginia was not [...] "in so poor a condition as to require a charitable donation from Congress," [...] he contended. He was chosen to participate in an audit of the Second Bank of the United States in 1818 as part of a five-man committee, and was appalled by corruption he perceived within the bank. He argued for the revocation of the bank charter, although Congress rejected any such proposal. His first clash with General Andrew Jackson followed Jackson's 1818 invasion of Florida during the First Seminole War. While praising Jackson's character, Tyler condemned him as overzealous for the execution of two British subjects. Tyler was elected for a full term without opposition in early 1819.|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the motion of}} no confidence in Colombia during the period 1992 - 2014. There are two central arguments: firstly, the {{motion of no confidence}} is a mechanism for control and accountability which has allowed the opposition and some members of the coalition government to challenge some of the ministers’ decisions and actions, which in turn have been disclosed to the media and to the general public. Secondly, although the motion is an important control mechanism, none of the initiatives have been successful due to its regulation and the fact that all six governments from the period studied have been supported by <b>majorities</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress,</b> which have defended ministers...|$|R
