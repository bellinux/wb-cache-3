An understanding of the formation and occurrence of these <b>melt</b> <b>layers</b> will help us to interpret records of past melt occurrences from polar ice cores such as the Siple Dome ice-core record from West Antarctica.

50|$|Most of the {{existing}} pulse cloud radars operate in the LDR-mode. In this mode, a radar transmits a horizontally polarized radiation and receives horizontal and vertical components of the scattered radiation in co-polarized and cross-polarized channels, respectively. The ratio of the power in the cross-polarized channel over the power in the co-polarized channel, named as linear depolarization ratio, is the polarimetric variable obtained by cloud radars of this type. Often cloud radars have two receiving units, which allows simultaneous measurements of the orthogonal components of the received signal. Some cloud radars have only one receiving unit and measure the orthogonal components consequently, with pulse-to-pulse switching of the receiving channel. Many of operational cloud radars with LDR-mode are pointed vertically together with other remote sensing instruments in order to retrieve microphysical properties of cloud particles. LDR, measured by vertically pointed cloud radar, {{is used for the}} detection of the <b>melting</b> <b>layer</b> (also denominated as bright band) and clutter filtering.

5000|$|Southern {{hemisphere}} flow like features (Not to {{be confused}} with the Northern Hemisphere flow like features which form under different conditions). These flow out of the dark deposits that form after the dry ice geysers erupt in early Spring. They grow at a rate of around 1.4 meters per Martian sol. All the models for these features, to date, involve some form of water. Möhlmann uses a solid state greenhouse effect in his model, similarly to the process that forms the geysers, but with translucent ice rather than dry ice as the solid state greenhouse layer. In his model, first the ice forms a translucent layer - then as summer approaches, the solid state greenhouse effect raises the temperature of a layer below the surface to 0 °C, so melting it. This is a process familiar on the Earth for instance in Antarctica, where it forms preferentially in [...] "blue ice". On Mars, in his model, the <b>melting</b> <b>layer</b> is 5 to 10 cms below the surface. The liquid water layer starts off millimeters thick in their model, and can develop to be centimeters thick as the season progresses. This requires conditions for bare and optically transparent ice fields on Mars translucent to depths of several centimeters, and it's an open question whether this can happen, but there is nothing to rule it out either. The other open question is whether their assumption of low thermal conductivity of the ice, preventing escape of the heat to the surface, is valid on Mars. This solid state greenhouse effect process favours equator facing slopes at higher latitudes, close to the poles, over lower latitudes, where surface ice can form to thicknesses of tens of centimeters. (The examples at Richardson crater are only 18° from the south pole.). Another model for these southern hemisphere flow like features involves ULI water (undercooled liquid water) which forms as a thin layer over surfaces and can melt at well below the usual melting point of ice.This forms on the surfaces of solar heated grains in the ice, which then flows together down the slope, and can supply several litres a day of water to the seepage flows. This ULI water would be the water source for liquid brines which then flow down the surface to form the features.|$|E

The DSD profile is {{used to determine the}} atmospheric absorption/extinction profile, which enables the surface contribution to the measured brightness temperature to be estimated.

In order to obtain analytic results, we assume a simple geometry for the rails, an electromagnetic skin effect boundary edge that propagates with the accelerating armature, and a current carrying channel controlled by magnetic field diffusion into the rails. We compute the temperature distribution in the rails {{at the time that}} the armature leaves the rails. For the range of exit velocities, from 1500 m/s to 5000 m/s, we find the highest temperatures are near the gun breech. After a single gun firing, the temperature reaches the melting temperature of the metal rails in a layer of finite thickness near the surface of the rails, for rails made of copper or tantalum. We plot the thickness of the <b>melt</b> <b>layer</b> as a function of position along the rails.
