Method of claim 1 or 2, further comprising..." [...] The rules for this are quite specific: specific claims must be referenced ("the method {{of any of these}} other claims" [...] is incorrect); the claims must be referenced in the alternative ("the method of claims 1 and 2" [...] is incorrect); etc. While still acceptable, this claim style is seldom used in the U.S. because it is counted for filing fee purposes according to the number of claims that it references. Thus, if the claim depends from three former claims, it is counted for fee purposes as three dependent claims. In light of the [...] "excess claim" [...] fees currently imposed by the USPTO, this tactic can quickly become expensive. <b>Multiple</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>claims</b> are, however, very commonly used in other jurisdictions, including Canada and Europe.|$|E

5000|$|Clarification/broadening of the {{independent}} claim: Independent claims are typically written with very broad terms, to avoid permitting competitors to circumvent the claim by altering {{some aspect of the}} basic design. But when a broad wording is used, it may raise a question as to the scope of the term itself. If a <b>dependent</b> <b>claim</b> is specifically drawn to a narrower interpretation, then, at least in the U.S., the doctrine of claim differentiation states that {{the independent}} claim must be different from, and therefore broader than, the <b>dependent</b> <b>claim</b> [...] The doctrine dictates that it [...] "is improper for courts to read into an independent claim a limitation explicitly set forth in another claim." [...] This means that if an independent claim recites a chair with a plurality of legs, and a <b>dependent</b> <b>claim</b> depending from the independent recites a chair with 4 legs, the independent claim is not limited to what is recited in the <b>dependent</b> <b>claim.</b> The <b>dependent</b> <b>claim</b> protects chairs with 4 legs, and the independent claim protects chairs with 4 legs as well as chairs having 2, 3, 5 or more legs. Similarly, it may be unclear whether a [...] "base" [...] includes a [...] "set of legs." [...] A <b>dependent</b> <b>claim,</b> including the phrase, [...] "wherein said base comprises a set of legs," [...] if allowed by the patent examiner, clarifies that the word base in the independent claim does not necessarily include legs. In practice, <b>dependent</b> <b>claims</b> are often used to home in on the inventor's preferred embodiment of the invention (e.g., the actual product design that the inventor intends to use.) The independent claim broadly describes the invention; <b>dependent</b> <b>claim</b> #1 describes the invention in a narrower aspect that more specifically describes the preferred embodiment; <b>dependent</b> <b>claim</b> #2 is narrower still; etc.|$|R

5000|$|In some jurisdictions, once {{a patent}} is issued, the patent holder may request a [...] "reissue" [...] of the patent to correct {{mistakes}} in the issued patent.

We run simulations of observed and potential growth trajectories among sub-adults and their consequent energetic demands on parents given profiles of fertility, mortality, consumption and production. We find that either sub-adult production or food subsidies from other people must substantially increase in order to compensate for the dramatic increase in energetic demand on parents if offspring were to grow faster at younger ages. Our conclusion is that slow human growth followed by a rapid adolescent growth spurt may have facilitated rising human fertility rates and greater investments in neural capital...|$|R
40|$|Some {{complex systems}} {{experience}} <b>multiple</b> <b>dependent</b> competing failure processes, and many traditional approaches to reliability are inadequate or inappropriate {{because there are}} two or more dependent/correlated failure processes and multiple components subject to failure. A typical design example representative of these systems is Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems. The dependency among the failure processes and the dependency among the component failure times present challenging issues in reliability modeling. In reality, for many actual engineering problems, there are interactions between soft failure and catastrophic failure {{that should not be}} ignored. Also, interaction among components should be considered. This paper develops a new reliability model and optimal preventive maintenance policies for complex multi-component systems experiencing multiple failure processes due to simultaneous exposure to degradation and shock loads. The developed reliability and maintenance models are demonstrated for a multicomponent systems example. These models can also be applied directly or customized for other complex systems that experience <b>multiple</b> <b>dependent</b> competing failure processes...|$|R

40|$|Patent claims play an {{important}} role in every patent case and it is the core for evaluation of infringement, validity or originality. There are two main types of claims: the independent claims (stand on their own), and the <b>dependent</b> <b>claims</b> (depending on a single/several claim/claims). Axiomatic design is a design theory that is based on the axioms. The axiomatic design theory makes use of corollaries and theorems which guide/help designers mapping functional domain to physical domain. The relation between functional requirements and design parameters is assured by so called design matrix. In an ideal design the number of design parameters is equal to the number of functional requirements, and the functional requirements are always kept independent from each other. When there are more design parameters than functional requirements, the design is a redundant design. A coupled design can became decoupled by selecting different set of design parameters. The idea of construction of patent claims using Axiomatic Design is based on the assumption of independent claims as a part of an ideal design and <b>dependent</b> <b>claims</b> as a part of a decoupled design...|$|R

40|$|For {{complex systems}} that {{experience}} <b>Multiple</b> <b>Dependent</b> Competing Failure Processes (MDCFP), the dependency among the failure processes presents challenging issues in reliability modeling. This article, develops reliability models and preventive maintenance policies for systems subject to MDCFP. Specifically, two dependent/correlated failure processes are considered: soft failures caused jointly by continuous smooth degradation and additional abrupt degradation damage {{due to a}} shock process and catastrophic failures caused by an abrupt and sudden stress from the same shock process. A general reliability model is developed based on degradation and random shock modeling (i. e., extreme and cumulative shock models), which is then extended to a specific model for a linear degradation path and normally distributed shock load sizes and damage sizes. A preventive maintenance policy using periodic inspection is also developed by minimizing the average long-run maintenance cost rate. The developed reliability and maintenance models are demonstrated for a micro-electro-mechanical systems application example. These models can also be applied directly or customized for other complex systems that experience <b>multiple</b> <b>dependent</b> competing failure processes...|$|R
