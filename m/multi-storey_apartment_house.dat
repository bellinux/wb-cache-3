40|$|The {{problem of}} renovating a {{residential}} district of <b>multi-storey</b> <b>apartment</b> <b>houses</b> is analysed. <b>Multi-storey</b> buildings make {{a large percentage}} of all housing facilities. Therefore, renovation is a significant problem for most countries. Germany has great experience in renovating <b>multi-storey</b> <b>apartment</b> <b>houses,</b> and therefore could be usefully applied under Lithuanian conditions. To increase the efficiency of renovation, a complex approach to this process, including the modernization of the whole residential district, should be used. The present paper considers the strategies of modernizing Hellersdorf district in Berlin embracing the problem of sustainable renovation and building management, the differentiation of dwellings supply in order to maintain a mixed social structure, the development of the city centre as a functional core in the district of <b>multi-storey</b> <b>apartment</b> <b>houses,</b> improvement in life standards and quality, the integration of residential houses into the existing environment, the development of democratic planning and the selection of partners.   Article in Lithuanian </div...|$|R

40|$|A {{need for}} methods to assess fire risks in timber frame {{buildings}} {{lead to the}} development of FRIMMAB, a Fire Risk Index Method for <b>Multi-storey</b> <b>Apartment</b> Buildings. The main objective of this report is to evaluate this method against a different risk analysis method, in this case a standard QRA (quantitative risk analysis) based on an event tree. Four different <b>multi-storey</b> <b>apartment</b> buildings in the Nordic countries were analysed in this study. The QRA resulted in a certain ranking of the four buildings with respect to fire risk. The Fire Risk Index Method was then used to analyse the same buildings. Three slightly different approaches were used to arrive at a fire risk index for each building. The Index Method results gave exactly the same ranking as the quantitative risk analysis for all three approaches. The conclusion of the analysis is therefore that FRIM-MAB seems to work reasonably well for <b>multi-storey</b> <b>apartment</b> buildings, but further studies are recommended to confirm this...|$|R

An in-depth knowledge on this subject area is essential for the architects, as the <b>multi-storey</b> <b>apartments</b> have become one of the universally accepted built forms in the urban living environment. In the Sri Lankan context also it has become an efficient mean of fulfilling the requirements of housing in the urban sector.
