5|$|Measure 1–30: the {{orchestra}} presents itself with {{what looks like}} a ritornello, but is in fact rather a concerto tutti. The <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> the form of an Italian aria, modelled after the concerto style Bach had developed in Köthen: in that style the material is presented in an instrumental tutti.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Jeffrey J. Kripal {{argued in}} his {{controversial}} , a psychoanalytic study of Ramakrishna's life, that Ramakrishna's mystical experiences were symptoms of repressed homoeroticism. Kripal also argued in Kali's Child that the Ramakrishna <b>Movement</b> <b>had</b> manipulated Ramakrishna's biographical documents, that the <b>Movement</b> <b>had</b> published them in incomplete and bowdlerised editions (claiming among other things, hiding Ramakrishna's homoerotic tendencies), {{and that the}} <b>Movement</b> <b>had</b> suppressed Ram Chandra Datta's Srisriramakrsna Paramahamsadever Jivanavrttanta.|$|R

5|$|The Tea Party <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> {{been arguing}} for {{repealing}} the Seventeenth Amendment entirely, claiming {{that it would}} protect states' rights and reduce {{the power of the}} federal government. On March 2, 2016, the Utah legislature approved Senate Joint Resolution No. 2 asking Congress to offer an amendment to the United States Constitution that would repeal the Seventeenth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|The feminist <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> {{effected}} {{change in}} Western society, including women's suffrage; {{greater access to}} education; more nearly equitable pay with men; the right to initiate divorce proceedings; the right of women to make individual decisions regarding pregnancy (including access to contraceptives and abortion); {{and the right to}} own property.|$|E
50|$|The Hashomer Hatzair <b>movement</b> <b>had</b> {{positioned}} itself politically {{between the}} moderate mainstream Mapai and the radical communists since the 1920s. The <b>movement</b> <b>had</b> however {{been reluctant to}} form a political party, since its leaders had felt that entering into party politics could push the movement into ideological deviations. The <b>movement</b> <b>had</b> tried to seek unity with Mapai and Ahdut HaAvoda before forming a party of its own, but those merger talks had failed as the other parties rejected the bi-nationalist positions of Hashomer Hatzair.|$|R
50|$|In 1995, Jeffrey J. Kripal {{argued in}} his {{controversial}} Kali's Child: The Mystical and the Erotic in the Life and Teachings of Ramakrishna, a psychoanalytic study of Ramakrishna's life, that Ramakrishna's mystical experiences were symptoms of repressed homoeroticism.

50|$|Claims and {{activities}} {{associated with the}} men's rights <b>movement</b> <b>have</b> been criticized by some scholars, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and commentators. Some sectors of the <b>movement</b> <b>have</b> been described as misogynistic. Others argue that perceived disadvantage is often due to loss of entitlement and privilege.|$|R
5|$|In the 1990s, the queercore {{movement}} developed {{around a}} number of punk bands with gay, lesbian, bisexual, or genderqueer members such as God Is My Co-Pilot, Pansy Division, Team Dresch, and Sister George. Inspired by openly gay punk musicians of an earlier generation such as Jayne County, Phranc, and Randy Turner, and bands like Nervous Gender, the Screamers, and Coil, queercore embraces a variety of punk and other alternative music styles. Queercore lyrics often treat the themes of prejudice, sexual identity, gender identity, and individual rights. The <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> continued into the 21st century, supported by festivals such as Queeruption.|$|E
5|$|La Resistance {{infiltrate}} the USO show, but The Mole is discovered {{and killed by}} guard dogs. The remaining boys attempt to warn their mothers {{about what will happen}} if Terrance and Phillip are killed, but they are laughed at, and Mr. Garrison activates the electric chair. A Canadian force attacks the base and a battle ensues between the two armies. In the confusion, the boys are able to free Terrance and Phillip, though Cartman's V-chip begins to malfunction. The mothers, seeing the destruction their <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> incited, decide to give up and look for their children.|$|E
5|$|Media {{coverage}} of the <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> focused on popular leaders, such as Hensley, and the deaths of ministers by snakebite have received particular attention. Practitioners of snake handling continue to view Hensley as a great man. Kimbrough recorded a discussion with an advocate of snake handling who dismissed Hensley's personal failings as slanderous fabrications. His advocacy, leadership, and– in particular– his personal charisma were important factors in the advancement of the movement.|$|E

50|$|During Hirn's tenure {{the mission}} society was given bad press, {{and also the}} {{relations}} to the Evangelical movement began to deteriorate. Members of this <b>movement</b> <b>had</b> earlier {{been among the most}} eager to support mission work, and the mission society and the Evangelical <b>movement</b> <b>had</b> held joint Mission and Gospel Feasts.|$|R
5|$|The Latin American lesbian <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> {{been the}} most active in Mexico, but has {{encountered}} similar problems in effectiveness and cohesion. While groups try to promote lesbian issues and concerns, they also face misogynistic attitudes from gay men and homophobic views from heterosexual women. In 1977, Lesbos, the first lesbian organization for Mexicans, was formed. Several incarnations of political groups promoting lesbian issues have evolved; 13 lesbian organizations were active in Mexico City in 1997. Ultimately, however, lesbian associations have had little influence both on the homosexual and feminist movements.|$|E
5|$|The Neo-Pentecostal <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> been {{characterized}} {{in part by}} an emphasis on prosperity theology, which gained greater acceptance within charismatic Christianity during the late 1990s. By 2006, {{three of the four}} largest congregations in the United States were teaching prosperity theology, and Joel Osteen has been credited with spreading it outside of the Pentecostal and Charismatic movement through his books, which have sold over 4 million copies. Bruce Wilkinson's The Prayer of Jabez also sold millions of copies and invited readers to seek prosperity.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} {{distinct}} currencies also theoretically removes exchange rate risks, although {{the imposition of}} transfer restrictions in 2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis means {{that the situation is}} not quite so simple. The risk of unanticipated exchange rate <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> always added an additional risk or uncertainty for companies or individuals that invest or trade outside their own currency zones. Companies that hedge against this risk will no longer need to shoulder this additional cost. This is particularly important for countries whose currencies had traditionally fluctuated a great deal, particularly the Mediterranean nations.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps the {{movement}} which most influenced Isaac Newton was Rosicrucianism. [...] Though the Rosicrucian <b>movement</b> <b>had</b> caused {{a great deal}} of excitement within Europe's scholarly community during the early seventeenth century, by the time Newton had reached maturity the <b>movement</b> <b>had</b> become less sensationalized.

5|$|The {{arguments}} for evolution being a religion generally amount to arguments by analogy: {{it is argued}} that evolution and religion have one or more things in common, and that therefore evolution is a religion. Examples of claims made in such arguments are statements that evolution is based on faith, and that supporters of evolution dogmatically reject alternative suggestions out-of-hand. These claims have become more popular in recent years as the neo-creationist <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> sought to distance itself from religion, thus giving it more reason to make use of a seemingly anti-religious analogy.|$|E
5|$|The vast <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> {{aspects of}} both a fugue and a ritornello movement. In the first fugal section, the voices enter in the {{sequence}} tenor, alto, soprano I, soprano II, bass, expanding from middle range to the extreme parts, just as the theme expands from the repeated first notes to sighing motives leading upwards. In the second fugal section, the instruments begin in low registers, and the voices build, with every part first in extremely low range, from bass to soprano I. In both sections, the instruments open the fugue, but play with the voices once they enter.|$|E
5|$|To {{some degree}} the <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> been successful. Beginning in 1998, the {{official}} curriculum in Taiwan schools {{has been changed}} to contain more frequent and favorable mention of aborigines. In 1996 the Council of Indigenous Peoples was promoted to a ministry-level rank within the Executive Yuan. The central government has taken steps to allow romanized spellings of aboriginal names on official documents, offsetting the long-held policy of forcing a Han name on an aborigine. A relaxed policy on identification now allows a child to choose their official designation if they are born to mixed aboriginal/Han parents.|$|E

5|$|A new {{generation}} of more entertainment-oriented movies coming from the Somali film industry has grown increasingly popular among Somalis both within Somalia and in the diaspora. Referred to as Somaliwood, this upstart cinematic <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> energized the local movie scene, in the process introducing innovative storylines, production techniques and advertising strategies. The latter include cross-media marketing, with tie-in film soundtracks featuring prominent Somali music artists. Popular movies from Somaliwood include the Somali language slasher thriller Xaaskayga Araweelo, the action comedy Rajo, and Warmooge, the first Somali animated film. The young directors Abdisalam Aato of Olol Films and Abdi Malik Isak are {{at the forefront of}} this quiet revolution. In 2010, the Somali director Mo Ali also released Shank, his first feature film set in a futuristic London.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> drawn many {{followers}} {{from the}} middle class and is most popular in commuter towns and urban areas. In Exporting the American Gospel: Global Christian Fundamentalism Steve Brouwer, Paul Gifford, and Susan Rose speculate that the movement was fueled by a prevailing disdain for social liberalism in the United States that began in the 1970s. Rosin argues that prosperity theology emerged because of broader trends, particularly American economic optimism in the 1950s and 1990s. Tony Lin of the University of Virginia has also compared the teaching to manifest destiny, the 19th-century belief that the United States was entitled to the West. Marvin Harris argues that the doctrine's focus on the material world is a symptom of the secularization of American religion. He sees it as an attempt to fulfill the American Dream by using supernatural power.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 21st century some groups reached {{mainstream}} popularity. There are Christian metal bands that perform virtually every subgenre of metal. The Christian metal <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> spread worldwide since it emerged in the early 1980s, and there are now hundreds of active Christian metal bands. Inspired by the metal revival, many 1980s bands have made comebacks including Saint, Bloodgood and Stryper. In October 2004, Doug Van Pelt brought Heaven's Metal back as its own fanzine. The Internet has had a significant role on the revival of Christian metal as well. Many websites and online communities are dedicated to discussions about Christian metal's music, events, and bands.|$|E
