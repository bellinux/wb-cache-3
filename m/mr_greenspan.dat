She attended four years of grammar school and also four years of High School. Her emigration route 				led her from Austria to Belgium (Antwerp) and after 11 months there {{she was able to}} go to the USA. There she married and became mother of three children.

5000|$|According to some, the bailouts {{could be}} traced {{directly}} to Alan Greenspan's efforts to reflate {{the stock market}} and the economy after the tech stock bust, and specifically to a February 23, 2004 speech <b>Mr.</b> <b>Greenspan</b> made to the Mortgage Bankers Association where he suggested that {{the time had come to}} push average American borrowers into more exotic loans with variable rates, or deferred interest. This argument suggests that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Greenspan</b> sought to enlist banks to expand lending and debt to stimulate asset prices and that the Federal Reserve and US Treasury Department would back any losses that might result. As early as March 2007 some commentators predicted that a bailout of the banks would exceed $1 trillion, at a time when Ben Bernanke, Alan Greenspan and Henry Paulson all claimed that mortgage problems were [...] "contained" [...] to the subprime market and no bailout of the financial sector would be necessary.|$|E

Woods defiantly proclaims his innocence, frustrating his lawyer, James Locket, who advises him to show less attitude in court. At the same time, community activist Reverend Banks raises awareness of the death of a black prisoner whom he believes to have been murdered by the police while in custody.

5000|$|In 1964, Hudson, who {{had just}} {{received}} his master's degree in economics, joined Chase Manhattan Bank's research economics department as a balance-of-payments specialist. His task was to establish the payment capacity of Argentina, Brazil and Chile. Based on data on their export earnings and other international payments, Hudson {{had to find out}} what kind of income the bank could get from the debt payments that these countries had accumulated. [...] "I soon found," [...] recalled the scientist, [...] "that the Latin American countries I analyzed were fully “loaned up.” There were no more hard-currency inflows available to extract as interest on new loans or bond issues. In fact, there was capital flight." [...] Among other important tasks that Hudson performed in Chase Manhattan, were an analysis of the balance of payments of the American oil industry and the tracking of [...] "dirty" [...] money that settled in the banks of Switzerland. According to the scientist, this work has given him invaluable experience in understanding how banks and the financial sector work, as well as understanding how banking accounting and real life correlate. It was during the study of oil companies' flows (the study was funded by Chase Manhattan and Socony Oil Company) that Hudson met with Alan Greenspan (future Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors) who acted as an observer for Socony Oil. Hudson recalled that Greenspan had already successfully lobbied the interests of his clients in those years and, in the framework of the research, tried to provide rough estimates of the American market, based on global trends: [...] "Mr. Rockefeller, Chase President, told me to inform <b>Mr.</b> <b>Greenspan</b> that unless he could provide specifically US figures, and/or be forthright about his assumptions, we would have to leave his contribution out of the study” [...]|$|E
40|$|When {{the risk}} premium in the US stock market fell far below its {{historic}} level, Shiller (2000) attributed {{this to a}} bubble driven by psychological factors. As an alternative explanation, we {{point out that the}} observed risk premium may be reduced by one-sided intervention policy {{on the part of the}} Federal Reserve, which leads investors into the erroneous belief that they are insured against downside risk. By allowing for partial credibility and state dependent risk aversion, we show that this "insurance" - referred to as the Greenspan put - is consistent with the observation that implied volatility rises as the market falls. Our bubble, like Shiller's, involves market psychology, but what we describe is not so much "irrational exuberance" as exaggerated faith in the stabilizing power of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Greenspan.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|A humbled <b>Mr.</b> <b>Greenspan</b> {{admitted}} that he had put too much faith in the self-correcting power of free markets. (Andrews, 2008, p. B 31) With the economy facing catastrophic collapse, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve for almost 20 years, {{admitted that}} his guiding theoretical principles may have been wrong. This was just one more blow to the self-esteem of economists, but his admission came as no surprise to those who knew that economic models do not describe the behavior of the average person. Most economists have ignored that warning, until now. But when a political economist schooled in the same tradition as Greenspan concludes that humans are not after all “dispassionate optimization machines ” (p. 111), we have further confirmation that a new approach to setting national policy is required. Margaret Polski is an experienced political economist who has consulted widely for businesses and government agencies.

40|$|With the {{collapse}} of Communism in 1989 and the increasingly skilful management of the market economy (as exemplified by <b>Mr</b> <b>Greenspan,</b> Chairman of the Fed since 1987), {{the risks associated with}} owning US equities clearly fell {{towards the end of the}} last century. Fukuyama’s(1992) analysis captured the spirit of the time. The clash of great ideologies was over. Fascism had been defeated by force and Communism brought down by its own inefficiency. This left market capitalism allied with Democratic Socialism triumphant for all time: for Fukuyama it was ‘the end of history’. This view did not go unchallenged [...] some said that it showed that its author did not know enough history. But, with inflation tamed by Central Bankers, it was, at least for those in developed countries, a time to live in peace and freedom and to enjoy an ever-increasing standard of living [...] enhanced by the exciting promises of the New Economy. More optimism on growth and less fear of World War and Great Depression surely justified a substantial re-rating of the stock market and values went up sharply. By the end of 1998, for example, US stocks had risen to a value of over 13 trillio...|$|E
40|$|Greenspan {{for a great}} line {{in one of his}} speeches, {{entitled}} The History of Money, {{from where}} I borrowed my title. He wrote: “If fiat money falters, we may {{have to go back to}} oxen as our medium of exchange. In that event, I trust, the Federal Reserve will have an adequate inventory of oxen. ” My article was designed to reassure <b>Mr.</b> <b>Greenspan</b> that the supply of oxen at the Fed was very secure indeed, in no small measure due to his stewardship. In my missive I related a story my father was fond of telling us about his geography professor lecturing on Switzerland. A short fellow, he was extolling the agriculture of that country as he would say: “In our country oxen are not even as tall as I am. In some countries you will see oxen as big as I. But, ladies and gentlemen, believe it or not, on the fat mountain pastures of Switzerland there are oxen even greater than myself. ” For the sake of emphasis the good professor stood on his tiptoes and stretched his arm to reach above his head. “We don’t believe so! ” — someone shouted from the back benches of the lecture theater. The story bears repeating because, as events of the intervening years have proved, the prize specimen of the supply of oxen at the Fed is the chairman (past and present). When the faltering of paper money looms large on the horizon, his first thought of an alternative is not gold. It is oxen. No...|$|E
