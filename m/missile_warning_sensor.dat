40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to investigate the relationships between automation false alarm rate, human trust in automation, and human use of automation, specifically under conditions of simulated high risk. The experiment involved military pilots flying combat and non-combat missions while employing a <b>missile</b> <b>warning</b> <b>sensor</b> with two levels of automation. The experiment was performed in a high fidelity F- 16 simulator with U. S. Air Force F- 16 pilots as test subjects. Three sensor false alarm rates were tested. The results showed that the level of <b>missile</b> <b>warning</b> <b>sensor</b> automation preferred by the pilots was strongly dependent on the false alarm rate of the automation. The data demonstrated that as false alarm rate increased, pilot trust of the <b>missile</b> <b>warning</b> <b>sensor</b> decreased, resulting in the pilot preferring a lower level of automation. However, the results also showed that even when pilots expressed little trust in the system, they preferred to use some level of automation rather than turn the system off. This result was attributed to the cost/benefit tradeoff of using the automation, as well as the extreme difficulty and hazard associated with the task. Analysis of the pilot mean reaction time in response to a <b>missile</b> <b>warning</b> <b>sensor</b> alert showed that reaction time increased as the false alarm rate increased, although this effect appeared to be less significant the higher the false alarm rate. Missile hit data indicated that as false alarm rate increased, the number of missiles that hit the pilot’s aircraft also increased, demonstrating a degradation in pilot survivability. Missile hit results also indicated that using a higher level of automation improved pilot survivability for the scenarios tested. This study was funded by the United States Air Force (USAF) Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) program office (ASC/LNWP) ...|$|E
