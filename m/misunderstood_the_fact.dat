40|$|In 1967 Strocchi {{established}} that the quantisation of the electromagnetic field using a vector potential is impossible {{within the context of}} conventional field theory. Although this result is frequently referred to its significance is largely <b>misunderstood.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> that the electromagnetic field cannot be described in conventional field theory reflects more upon conventional field theory than theories of the electromagnetic field. A reappraisal of electromagnetic field theories should therefore be made. It could well be that features of these theories that have been previously regarded as deficiencies are not really deficiencies at all. This thesis is an account of the radiation gauge, Gupta - Bleuler and Fermi methods of quantising the electromagnetic field from that point of view. The radiation gauge and Gupta - Bleuler methods are well established schemes. Our discussion does not yield any results concerning these methods that cannot be found elsewhere. It does, however, serve to place them in a wider context. The Fermi method is little understood and hence most of this work is concerned with it. Even though the various formulations of field theory are by no means equivalent, they all eventually reproduce traditional field theory. Thus if we only require that the theory be rigorously formulated for such examples as the neutral scalar field it does not matter which formulation we choose. The differences are, however, important for applications to the quantisation methods of the electromagnetic field. The formulations have to be modified and the point at which such modifications must be made and their nature depends on both the general formulation and the quantisation method. The formalism that provides the most suitable framework for a rigorous formulation of the Fermi method {{turns out to be the}} C * algebra formulation of Segal. Following Segal, the Weyl algebra of the vector potential is constructed. The Fermi method is then related to a certain representation of the algebra. The representation is specified by a generating functional for a state on the algebra. Usually, dynamical and kinematical transformations are represented by unitarily implementable automorphisms of the algebra. We prove that this is not always true in the representation given by the Fermi method. The Weyl algebra of the physical field is then constructed as a factor algebra. Difficulties with both the Fermi and Gupta - Bleuler methods can he attributed to the need to use a factor algebra. The canonical commutation relations [x [subscript] µ, p [subscript] ν] = - i g [subscript] µ [subscript] ν are formulated as a Weyl algebra. We study the Schrödinger representation of the algebra and find that the Fermi method is just the generalisation of this representation to an infinite number of degrees of freedom. Further analogies are also possible. We can construct factor algebras from the Weyl algebra. The mechanics of such procedures can he studied without the additional complications of an infinite number of degrees of freedom. The Schrödinger representation of the Fermi method is then constructed. We conclude with a discussion of the results that have been obtained and an indication of ways in which the work might be extended. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Edward Branigan's Point of View in the Cinema [1] joins a {{long list}} of works on {{narration}} and narrative, the more well-known of which are Lubbock's The Craft of Fiction, Stanzel's Narrative Situations in the Novel, Norman Friedman's Point of View in the Fiction', Booth's The Rhetoric of Fiction, Chatman's Story and Discourse, and Uspensky's A Poetics of Composition. [2] Point of View in the Cinema impresses for a variety of reasons. It rests on a broad, sound assumption of narrative being a heterogeneous arrangement of signs which transcends any specific semiotic system, for the description of which the analogue of linguistic signification is useful, but which should be seen neither as the only critical tool nor even as the most privileged one. Narrative is understood as a dynamic structure recognisable independently from its material of expression and requiring for its analysis specific attention to the medium in which it manifests itself. In Branigan's book this medium is 'film' in the sense of 'cinema', not merely a text but also a cultural institution. The book addresses itself to a large number of detailed problems of film theory and in so doing refers the reader to a rich body of film texts. At the same time the author manages to distinguish between levels of generality and specificity, no mean accomplishment given the complexity of the polysemiotic structures he has chosen to analyse. A particular strength, it seems to me, is the book's foregrounding of the active work of the film viewer. This has as a corollary the diminished responsibility of the author/auteur's construct, filmic images as such, the camera and other profilmic tools (though their importance as cinematic facts is by no means underrated). In spite of the book's insistence on the generation of filmic meaning in the act of viewing, Branigan avoids a wholly relativist position. The reason for this balance lies in Branigan's view of the systemic nature of all cultural activity and its codes. These are argued to bind individual readers to a semiotic community and provide the relative freedom to generate an infinite number of filmic meanings from a limited set of basic rules. The book also draws our attention to a list of principles which distinguish our construction of narrative in classical film from that in modern film texts, along the lines of Roland Barthes' distinction between the 'readerly' and the 'writerly' composition. Throughout the book Branigan analyses film viewing {{from the perspective of the}} five units of classical representation: origin, vision, time, frame, and mind. The author uses these to theorise, among others, the concepts of point of view, subjectivity, narration and narrative, character and representation. Compared with this general verdict, a recent review of Branigan's study by Seymour Chatman is not a friendly act, to say the least. [3] The book is blamed for its clumsy handling of theory, poor style, a confusion of representation and viewing, an overemphasis on the reader, poor editing, and its exorbitant price. Perhaps Chatman's attack is not so surprising when one recalls the relatively insignificant position which the reader/viewer is granted in his own schema in Story and Discourse. Chatman, it would appear, has <b>misunderstood</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that from the position of cinema, that is film viewing, all constructions of narrative meaning are primarily acts of reading. My own response to Branigan's work in this article is a detailed and, I hope, fair summary of his argument, followed by a brief, critical commentary...|$|E
