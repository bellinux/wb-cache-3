50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war the Iraqi government had a <b>monetary</b> <b>reserve</b> of 35 billion ID, and the annual growth rate was 27.9 percent. During the early war years, ambitious development plans were followed; because of high military spending (approaching 50 percent of GNP in 1982), the Iraqi economy began showing signs of bankruptcy in the mid-to-late 1980s. The war had cost the Iraqi government 226 billion dollars, which in turn had led to a staggering foreign debt of between 80 and 100 billion dollars. The rate of debt increase was estimated to be 10 billion a year. Another problem facing the regime was in agriculture; manpower had been depleted during the war years, and agricultural production plummeted. The situation became even bleaker after the war. Minister of Foreign Affairs Tariq Aziz acknowledged that the situation had become so bad that the Iraqi government could not afford to pay for the food it had imported. Former foreign creditors were reluctant to loan money to Iraq because of the economy's near-bankruptcy.|$|E

During the war, one million were mobilised in the war against Iran. Of the million sent to war, 100,000 died. The labour shortage led to stagnation; to fill the gap, an increasing number of women were hired. There was a shift in industrial production during the war from consumer to military goods.

Systemic risk is characterized by a large number of banks reaching a default threshold by a given time horizon. Our model incorporates a game feature where each bank controls its rate of borrowing/lending to a central bank. The optimization reflects the desire of each bank to borrow from the central bank when its <b>monetary</b> <b>reserve</b> falls below a critical level or lend if it rises above this critical level which is chosen here as the average <b>monetary</b> <b>reserve.</b> Borrowing from or lending to the central bank is also subject to a quadratic cost at a rate which can be fixed by the regulator. We solve explicitly for Nash equilibria with finitely many players, and we show that in this model the central bank acts as a clearing house, adding liquidity to the system without affecting its systemic risk. We also study the corresponding Mean Field Game in the limit of large number of banks in the presence of a common noise...|$|E

V praktické části je zkoumán vliv vybraných faktorů na vývoj devizového kurzu CZK/EUR ve zvoleném období 2002 - 2011. Působení vybraných faktorů, jejichž výběr vychází z obecně platné teorie, na vývoj devizového kurzu je zkoumán prostřednictvím metod regresní a korelační analýzy. Tyto metody umožňují ověřovat statistickou závislost mezi zvolenými proměnnými.

The theoretical part consists of general knowledge regarding the currency markets, foreign exchange rates and the process of econometric modeling. In the practical part is examined the influence of selected factors on the development of the foreign exchange rate CZK/EUR in the selected period 2002 - 2011. Effect of selected factors, whose selection is based on the generally applied theory to the evolution of exchange rates is researched through methods of regression and correlation analysis.

40|$|Money {{occupies}} a central position {{in both the}} disciplines of law and economics. From the legal point of view, money constitutes {{a vital part of}} the legal system. Ever since the advance from a barter economy, money has become a central instrumentality of legal transactions. Seeking a legal definition of the phenomenon of money is, therefore, an invaluable exercise for the discipline of law. However, as money is an economic phenomenon, seeking to ascertain the meaning of money for legal purposes cannot be comprehensively pursued without due regard to economics. This thesis sets out to show the importance of monetary and other economic factors in analysing and applying the law of money. In particular, this thesis sets out to identify the principal functions performed by money from the viewpoint of their relevance in comprehensively defining the phenomenon for legal purposes. It examines the legal meaning of money in the context of such developments as the use of advancing technology to transmit by electronic means rights to money at ever increasing speeds and amounts across the globe, floating exchange rate markets, the changing role of gold from its once unique position as the quintessential international <b>monetary</b> <b>reserve,</b> the development of "electronic cash", and the tracing of money through a series of paperless transactions. When examining these developments, there is a focus on how legal analysis might be assisted by identifying the role performed by money in specific sets of circumstances. While attention is given to international monetary units, such as the Special Drawing Right and the European Currency Unit where relevant throughout the thesis, the development of the Euro as the currency of the European Union in the twenty-first century is not specifically addressed. This is an on-going and developing process, raising specific issues such as natural currency areas within the European Union necessarily outside the ambit of this thesis, which focuses on the law of money proceeding from an Australian viewpoint to more general materials especially in the English-speaking world. However, this thesis does draw from the non-English-speaking world for materials and examples that may well be of universal significance, and have unique ramifications, in the process of determining the meaning of money for legal purposes. While focussing on the future, the thesis carefully considers the past from the point of view of determining the extent to which the existing law is able to deal with what appear as entirely new phenomena, associated with technological advancement and apparent rapid globalisation.

50|$|In 1836, {{directors}} of the Bank of England noticed that the Bank's <b>monetary</b> <b>reserves</b> had declined precipitously in recent years, possibly because of poor wheat harvests that forced Great Britain to import much of its food.

Conventional financial theory held that banks should raise interest rates and curb lending when faced with low <b>monetary</b> <b>reserves.</b> Raising interest rates, according to the laws of supply and demand, was supposed to attract specie since money generally flows where it will generate the greatest return (assuming equal risk among possible investments). In the open economy of the 1830s, characterized by free trade and relatively weak trade barriers, the monetary policies of the hegemonic power - in this case, Great Britain - were transmitted {{to the rest of the}} interconnected global economic system, included the U.S. The result was that as the Bank of England raised interest rates, major banks in the United States were forced to do the same.|$|R
