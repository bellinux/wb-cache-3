Whenever a user logs on, Active Setup checks if each <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> component GUID is present in the user part. If not, the component’s command is executed and the component’s GUID is added in the user part. If it is already present, the current user profile has already been modified and no further action is taken.|$|E
