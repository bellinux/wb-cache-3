5|$|In {{the weeks}} and months after {{conclusion}} of the Inquiry one possible explanation of the crash began to circulate among employees of ANA. This possibility began with one piece of evidence uncovered by the Inquiry during cross-examination of ANA's ground staff. It was reported that after sunrise the <b>morning</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> crash the one-gallon container used to check Amana's fuel filters was found empty and lying on its side on the apron a short distance from where Amana had been parked. The Inquiry attached no significance to this evidence and did not explore it further.|$|E

On the <b>morning</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> vote, each Congressman had an Alaska newspaper proclaiming statehood.|$|E
5|$|The {{facts about}} Abraham Lincoln's service during the Black Hawk War have been disputed. Lincoln was {{associated}} with two major battle sites, including Stillman's Run, {{in the aftermath of}} combat. A number of sources assert that on June 26, 1832, the <b>morning</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Second Battle of Kellogg's Grove, members of the company of Captain Jacob M. Early arrived at the grove to help bury the dead. One of these soldiers was Lincoln, who assisted with the burial. His later statement about the events has been linked to both the battle at Kellogg's Grove and the fight at Stillman's Run.|$|E

5|$|After {{undergoing}} trials {{following a}} refit, the Gnat {{met up with}} the Ladybird, who also had a ship's dog. However Judy had to be kept away as while he took a fancy to her, she did not care for him. In the early <b>morning</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Ladybird departed, Judy alerted the ship {{to the presence of}} river pirates who were about to board the Gnat in the darkness. The attack was easily repelled as the pirates lost the surprise element. Several days later, Judy was taken ashore with a shooting party for the first time but she was unsuccessful as a gundog. Throughout her stay on the Gnat, the crew repeatedly tried to use her as a gundog, each time resulting in a failure.|$|E

He left college in 1941 and joined the U.S. Army Air Forces, being posted to New Guinea {{to fight in the}} South West Pacific theatre of World War II. There, Hagerstrom mainly escorted bombers with his P-40 Warhawk, shooting down six Japanese aircraft {{over the course of the}} war, including four in one <b>morning.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> war, he flew with the Texas Air National Guard. By 1950 he was in command of a fighter squadron that was mobilized to Korea following the outbreak of the Korean War. He later transferred to the United States Air Force and flew in MiG Alley in a F-86 Sabre jet, scoring 8.5 victories over MiG-15s.|$|E

5|$|Despite German {{claims that}} the {{blockage}} did not impede their operations, the operation to close the Ostend canal {{seemed to have been}} at least partially successful. The channel was largely blocked and so Bruges was ostensibly closed off from the open sea, even if the position of the blockship meant that smaller ships could get through. In fact, the entire operation had been rendered moot before it even began, due to events at the wider canal in Zeebrugge. British assessments of that operation had proven optimistic and the channel there had not been properly closed. Small coastal submarines of the UC class had been able to pass through the channel as early as the <b>morning</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Zeebrugge Raid and German naval engineers were able to dredge channels around the blockages at both ports over the coming weeks.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{years after}} {{becoming}} abbot, one <b>morning</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Divine Liturgy {{a group of}} approximately thirty monks rose against Symeon, who drove them away. Breaking the locks on the monastery gate on their way out, the monks took their appeal to the Patriarch Sisinios, who sided with Symeon and sent the monks into exile. Symeon pleaded on their behalf, doing {{everything he could to}} have the monks return to the monastery, including seeking out some of the monks to apologize to them. During his time as abbot, Symeon wrote Hymns of Divine Love (completed during his exile), the Discourses, and many letters and polemical works which have been lost. He also wrote articles relating to his disputes with the church theologians—these survived as his theological and ethical treatises. In 1005 Symeon resigned as abbot of St. Mammas, appointing one of his disciples in his stead, and taking up a more solitary life at the monastery.|$|E
5|$|Focusyn, {{the fictional}} psychoactive drug that is {{prominently}} featured throughout the episode, {{is based on}} the real-life medicine Ritalin, which is used to treat disorders such as ADHD. Hosey the Bear, which {{can be seen in the}} beginning of the episode, is a reference to the United States Forest Service's mascot Smokey Bear. After Bart has flooded the school gym, Skinner can be seen wiping mud off his eyes in an homage to American actor Oliver Hardy. The sequence of Bart stealing an army tank and destroying half of Springfield under the influence of mind-altering substances is likely a reference to Shawn Nelson, a man infamous for a similar, albeit serious, incident. A scene in the episode shows Marge standing in front of the tank Bart has stolen. The scene is a reference to Tank Man, the anonymous man who stood in the way of a column of tanks the <b>morning</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Chinese military forcibly removed pro-democracy protesters from Beijing's Tiananmen Square.|$|E

5|$|Given Huskisson's importance, and the {{potential}} impact {{on the future of}} Liverpool and Manchester's industries and on the embryonic railway industry of any findings of liability {{on the part of the}} railway, a swift determination of the causes of the accident was considered essential. By 9.00am on the <b>morning</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> accident, a hastily convened coroner's jury was assembled in the Grapes public house in Eccles. The coroner himself, MrMilne, arrived at 10.00am and was in a hurry to proceed as he had another inquest scheduled that afternoon, but proceedings were unable to begin as Lord Wilton, the only sworn witness scheduled to attend the inquest, could not be found. In the meantime, Milne sent the jury to the vicarage to view Huskisson's body.|$|E
5|$|The <b>morning</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> arrests the {{soldiers}} continued marching north, proceeding 10 miles (16 kilometers) {{further to the}} headwaters of Fishing Creek and {{the base of the}} mountains in northern Columbia County.

The soldiers extensively searched the mountains of northern Columbia County for half a day, going as far north as the headwaters of East Branch Fishing Creek in southern Sullivan County, where they {{climbed to the top of}} North Mountain in three groups. At the headwaters of East Branch Fishing Creek {{the soldiers}} turned south again, then headed up West Branch Fishing Creek as far as the Sullivan County line. They found some evidence that people had been in the area, but these appeared to have been hunting or logging camps.|$|E

5|$|The <b>morning</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> battle, forty young noblemen from Besançon, {{suspected}} of sympathizing with the Protestant insurgents, were executed after lengthy torture sessions.

Many citizens were publicly hanged {{in front of the}} city hall. Some Protestants were hanged, beheaded, and quartered, while some others were dragged onto a publicly displayed pile of bodies. Some Protestant corpses were cut up and the pieces exposed on the city gates. Masses were held at St. Jean's Cathedral and St. Stephen's Cathedral of Besançon to celebrate the defeat of the Huguenots.|$|E
5|$|On 12 November Allenby made {{preparations}} for battle the following day. He ordered {{an attack by}} the 52nd (Lowland) Division to extend their position across the Nahr Sukereir on the Turkish Army's right flank. Reinforced with two additional brigades, he ordered the Australian Mounted Division to advance towards Tel es Safi where they encountered a determined and substantial Turkish counterattack. This counterattack forced the mounted division to concede the territory gained during the day, before fighting the Turkish Army to a standstill in front of Summeil. On the <b>morning</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> battle at Mughar Ridge, Junction Station was occupied and during the following days other villages in the area {{were found to have}} been abandoned. Later in the morning of 14 November New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade ran into a determined and well entrenched Turkish rearguard near Ayun Kara, which they attacked. Fierce close quarter fighting against the Turkish 3rd Infantry Division continued during the afternoon. Although severely threatened, the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade eventually prevailed and went on to occupy Jaffa two days later.|$|E
5|$|On 15 October, Napoli, {{which had}} been {{detached}} to reinforce the armored cruisers in the 2nd Division, 1st Squadron, arrived in Derna, Libya in company with several troopships. After a request sent to the defending Ottoman garrison to surrender was rejected, Napoli and the armored cruisers bombarded the town. In the span of 30 minutes, they had razed the town. At 14:00, the Italians attempted to land a contingent of 500 infantry, but heavy Turkish fire repulsed the assault, which prompted further bombardment from the Italian fleet. On 18 October, the Turks retreated from the town, which was thereafter occupied by the Italian army. In the meantime, Napoli had rejoined the 1st Division, and on 18 October, the unit had escorted a convoy of troopships to Benghazi. The Italian fleet bombarded the city the next <b>morning</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman garrison refused to surrender. During the bombardment, parties from the ships and the infantry from the troopships went ashore. The Italians quickly forced the Ottomans to withdraw into the city by evening. After a short siege, the Ottoman forces withdrew on 29 October, leaving {{the city to the}} Italians.|$|E
