500|$|Early {{during her}} student days in Troy, Stanton remembers being {{strongly}} influenced by Charles Grandison Finney, an evangelical preacher and central figure in the revivalist movement. His influence, combined with the Calvinistic Presbyterianism of her childhood, caused her great unease. After hearing Finney speak, Stanton became terrified {{at the possibility of}} her own damnation: [...] "Fear of judgment seized my soul. Visions of the lost haunted <b>my</b> <b>dreams.</b> Mental anguish prostrated my health. Dethronement of my reason was apprehended by my friends." [...] Stanton credits her father and brother-in-law, Edward Bayard, with convincing her to ignore Finney's warnings. She further credits their taking her on a rejuvenating trip to Niagara Falls with restoring her reason and sense of balance. She never returned to organized Christianity and, after this experience, always maintained that logic and a humane sense of ethics were the best guides to both thought and behavior.|$|E
