5|$|While the UN was {{reluctant}} to engage with the F-FDTL, several bilateral donors have assisted the force's development. Australia has provided extensive training and logistical support to the F-FDTL since it was established, and currently provides advisors who are posted to the F-FDTL and Ministry of Defence and Security. Portugal also provides advisors and trains two naval officers each year in Portugal. China provided US$1.8million in aid to the F-FDTL between 2002 and 2008 and agreed {{to build a new}} US$7million headquarters for the force in late 2007. East Timor is one of Brazil's main destinations for aid and the Brazilian Army is responsible for training the F-FDTL's military police unit (<b>Maubere</b> Mission). The United States also provides a small amount of assistance to the F-FDTL through the State Department's International Military Education and Training Program. While Malaysia has provided training courses and financial and technical aid, this assistance was suspended after the 2006 crisis. Under current arrangements Portugal provides the F-FDTL with basic and advanced training while Australia and other nations provide training in specialised skills. As of 2013 the East Timorese government had posted a single member of the F-FDTL to serve overseas as an observer with the United Nations Mission in Liberia. In 2015 the government was considering joining Australia's Pacific Patrol Boat Program.|$|E

50|$|Moruk {{eventually}} {{returned to}} East Timor from exile in the Netherlands. He founded the <b>Maubere</b> Revolutionary Council (KRM), {{also called the}} Revolutionary Council (KR), a paramilitary group. Under Maruk, the KRM sought popular support against the government through grassroots (known as <b>maubere</b> locally) appeals.|$|E

50|$|On 20 June 1988 the Resistencia Nacional dos Estudantes de Timor-Leste (RENETIL), the National Resistance of East Timorese Students, {{was created}} in Indonesia, {{reporting}} directly to FALINTIL and its Commander in Chief Xanana Gusmão. On 31 December 1988 Gusmão officially announced that FALINTIL was now the non-partisan armed resistance wing of the unified resistance movement, which was now {{to be known as}} the Conselho Nacional da Resistência <b>Maubere</b> (CNRM), the National Council of <b>Maubere</b> Resistance.|$|E
50|$|One of the UDT's {{most senior}} leaders, Mario Viegas Carrascalão, {{sided with the}} Indonesian regime, and served as the Governor of Indonesia's '27th Province' between 1987 and 1992. His brother, João, however, led the UDT in exile in Portugal and Australia, later joining with Fretilin in a {{national}} unity movement called the Conselho Nacional de Resistência <b>Maubere</b> (CNRM or National Council of <b>Maubere</b> Resistance), later called the Conselho Nacional de Resistência Timorense (CNRT or National Council of Timorese Resistance).|$|E
50|$|In March 2015, Moruk's rebel group, the <b>Maubere</b> Revolutionary Council (KRM), began {{a series}} of attacks on police. Members of the KRM {{assaulted}} a police compound using explosives and guns, in one of the March 2015 attacks, injuring four security personnel.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>Maubere</b> {{was coined}} by Ramos-Horta in the 1970s. Initially {{used by the}} Portuguese to {{describe}} illiterate members of the Mambai, {{one of the largest}} ethnic groups of East Timor, it was reinvented as a badge of national pride by FRETILIN.|$|E
50|$|In March 1986, the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (FRETILIN) and the Timorese Democratic Union (UDT) {{announced}} {{the formation of}} a coalition. In a re-organisation of the resistance structure, resistance leader Xanana Gusmão declared the resistance force Falintil to be a non-partisan 'national' army. In 1988 he relinquished membership of the political party Fretilin, believing the fight for a free East Timor transcended political loyalties. He established the National Council of <b>Maubere</b> Resistance (CNRM) and was declared leader. José Ramos-Horta became external spokesperson.|$|E
50|$|Mauk Moruk, born Paulino Gama, (22 June 1955 - 8 August 2015) was an East Timorese former Falintil guerrilla commander, {{opposition}} figure, and {{rebel leader}} of the <b>Maubere</b> Revolutionary Council (KRM). Moruk was {{a critic of the}} policies of the independent government of East Timor, advocating that the government do more to alleviate widespread unemployment and poverty in the country. Moruk was particularly critical of the policies for former President Xanana Gusmão, who is also a former guerilla leaders during the Indonesian occupation of East Timor.|$|E
50|$|The word <b>Maubere,</b> {{formerly}} {{used by the}} Portuguese {{to refer}} to native East Timorese and often employed as synonymous with the illiterate and uneducated, was adopted by FReTiLIn as a term of pride. Native East Timorese consist {{of a number of}} distinct ethnic groups, most of whom are of mixed Austronesian and Melanesian/Papuan descent. The largest Malayo-Polynesian ethnic groups are the Tetum (100,000), primarily in the north coast and around Dili; the Mambai (80,000), in the central mountains; the Tukudede (63,170), in the area around Maubara and Liquiçá; the Galoli (50,000), between the tribes of Mambae and Makasae; the Kemak (50,000) in north-central Timor island; and the Baikeno (20,000), in the area around Pante Macassar.|$|E
50|$|Anticipating an Indonesian {{invasion}} Manning {{and other}} CIET activists provided Fretilin {{with a number}} of radio transceivers in late 1975. When Indonesia invaded East Timor on 7 December 1975, Radio <b>Maubere,</b> as it was called became the main Fretilin link to the outside world and source of information about the situation in East Timor. It functioned until the capture by the Indonesian military of its Fretilin operator, Alarico Fernandes, in late 1978. For the first months messages were relayed by Telecom, the state owned telecommunications company, until it was ordered by the government to cease doing so. Manning and other CIET activists also operated a two-way radio communication, but this was confiscated by Telecom 27 January 1976. Working with CIET activist and fellow communist Denis Freney in Sydney, Manning then organised a series of volunteers to operate a clandestine radio link from bush locations in the following years, changing position on a regular basis to avoid detection. Although a number were caught and charged another was back on the air on each occasion {{in a short period of}} time.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{people believe}} that the lake water turns red because many victims of the invaders during the Indonesian {{occupation}} (1975-1999) are buried here. The fact that the last colorations occurred in the years 1975, 1999 and 2006, all years when East Timor {{had to cope with}} violent events (the Civil War and the Indonesian invasion in 1975, the crisis in 1999, and the unrest in 2006), also leads to superstition regarding the coloration. Tasitolu was at one time a popular meeting place for the ABRI; and subsequent to the 1975 invasion, many <b>Maubere</b> people were killed here.Approximately 400 m from the central lake, a traditional house was built in preparation for the 1989 visit of Pope John Paul II. He arrived in October, addressing a crowd at the [...] "Tasitolu Altar", and spoke the local Tetum language, as well as English. Subsequent to his death, a 6 m high monument dedicated to the Pope was erected in 2008; it stands on a hill {{on the west side of}} the Bay of Dili, across from a statue of Jesus Christ in Cristo Rei subdistrict on the east side. A chapel next to the statue reminds of his visit.|$|E

40|$|This thesis gives a brief {{scenario}} of events which {{culminated in the}} invasion of East Timor by the Indonesian armed forces in December 1975. It looks at {{the nature of the}} consequences of life under Indonesian occupation; examines the quality and nature of the resistance by the East Timorese people against their new coloniser; examines the leadership of the resistance movement and its re-structuring and examines the role of the United Nations and international diplomacy. There is also a discussion of East Timor in the context of global politics and the National Council of <b>Maubere</b> Resistance Peace Plan...|$|E
40|$|Xanana GusmÃ£o {{recently}} {{mentioned that}} a â€œSecond <b>Maubere</b> Miracleâ€ is underway, implying {{that a major}} political reform will soon shake the roots of Timor-Lesteâ€™s public administration. Decentralization, defined in a very broad sense, has been a constitutional mandate since independence, but successive governments have failed to engage this reform despite paying lip service to its necessity. This essay reviews the options before the policy makers â€“ both in theoretical terms (distinguishing between the various definitions of decentralization) and in the pragmatic forms that have been contemplated so far â€“ and discusses their implications for the process of rooting a modern democracy in the country both at the intermediate, district level and at the grassroots, suku (village) level. For this purpose, the essay brings together the authorâ€™s own field research and the rich literature that has emerged in the recent past, including contributions by Timorese colleagues...|$|E
40|$|In the {{six months}} since the article below was written, the main trends {{outlined}} have been confirmed by events. Fretilin forces continue to fight throughout the territory, despite the heavy blows Inflicted {{by the death of}} President Nicolau Lobato and the betrayal of Xavier do Amaral (now Suharto’s puppet Vice President) and Alarico Fernandes. The genocidal war continues on Suharto’s side, but, even on Jakarta’s own census figures, they control only half the population of East Timor. Within Indonesia, the Suharto regime has never been more under challenge. Workers, driven to desperation by high inflation and low frozen wages, have engaged in a series of illegal strikes; students are reorganising following the repression of the last half o f 1978, while intellectuals, dissident military men, and even some o f the puppet parliamentarians, are criticising the regime. Internationally, however, Suharto continues to manoeuvre {{within the context of the}} conflicts in Indochina and between the Soviet Union and China. This inevitably places East Timor in a difficult position in attempting to win support, for example, within the non-aligned nations movement. Nevertheless, the crucial and decisive factor is the continuing resistance of the <b>Maubere</b> people — the final guarantee of victory...|$|E
