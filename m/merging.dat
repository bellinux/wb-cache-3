50|$|A multiway <b>merge</b> {{allows for}} the files outside of memory to be <b>merged</b> in fewer passes than in a binary <b>merge.</b> If there are 6 runs that need be <b>merged</b> then a binary <b>merge</b> would need to take 3 <b>merge</b> passes, {{as opposed to a}} 6-way <b>merges</b> single <b>merge</b> pass. This {{reduction}} of <b>merge</b> passes is especially important considering the large amount of information that is usually being sorted in the first place, allowing for greater speed-ups while also reducing the amount of accesses to slower memory.|$|R

5|$|To derive a URI from a URI reference, {{software}} converts the URI {{reference to}} absolute form by <b>merging</b> {{it with a}} base URI according to a fixed algorithm. The system treats the URI reference as relative to the base URI, although {{in the case of}} an absolute reference, the base has no relevance. If the base URI includes a fragment identifier, it is ignored during the <b>merging</b> process. If a fragment identifier is present in the URI reference, it is preserved during the <b>merging</b> process.|$|E
5|$|At {{the extreme}} of {{interactions}} are galactic mergers. In {{this case the}} relative momentum of the two galaxies is insufficient to allow the galaxies to pass through each other. Instead, they gradually merge to form a single, larger galaxy. Mergers can result in significant changes to morphology, {{as compared to the}} original galaxies. If one of the <b>merging</b> galaxies is much more massive than the other <b>merging</b> galaxy then the result is known as cannibalism. The more massive larger galaxy will remain relatively undisturbed by the merger, while the smaller galaxy is torn apart. The Milky Way galaxy is currently in the process of cannibalizing the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy and the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMerging is {{a common}} way to compose both {{crosscutting}} and non-crosscutting models. In this paper, we argue that <b>merge</b> can be defined more generically as an operator at the meta-modelling level.

There are various <b>merge</b> variants and we concede that a full unification of all <b>merge</b> semantics may be infeasible. To define a common <b>merge,</b> we propose the definition of a common <b>merge</b> kernel as a semantic base that can be extended to realise the different expressions of <b>merge...</b>|$|R

As a result of inferior management of the water power, St. Anthony found its manufacturing district declining. Some people and organizations started to talk about <b>merging</b> the two cities. A citizens' committee recommended <b>merging</b> the two cities in 1866, but a vote on this issue was rejected in 1867. Minneapolis incorporated as a city in 1867. The two cities found themselves competing with St. Paul, which had a larger population, the head of navigation of the Mississippi River, and more access to railroads.|$|E

5|$|In {{the theory}} of cluster analysis, the nearest-neighbor chain {{algorithm}} is an algorithm that can speed up several methods for agglomerative hierarchical clustering. These are methods that take a collection of points as input, and create a hierarchy of clusters of points by repeatedly <b>merging</b> pairs of smaller clusters to form larger clusters. The clustering methods that the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm {{can be used for}} include Ward's method, complete-linkage clustering, and single-linkage clustering; these all work by repeatedly <b>merging</b> the closest two clusters but use different definitions of the distance between clusters. The cluster distances for which the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm works are called reducible and are characterized by a simple inequality among certain cluster distances.|$|E
