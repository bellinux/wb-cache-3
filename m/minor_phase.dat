50|$|Metal alkoxides, {{carboxylates}} such as alumatrane Al(OCH2CH2)3N, silatrane Si(OCH2CH2)3NOCH2CH2N(CH2CH2OH)2, and zirconium propionate Zr(O2CCH2CH3)2-(OH)2, {{are generally}} used, {{and they are}} dissolved in an alcohol solvent such as methanol or ethanol. Solubility of the precursor in alcohol is an important property, which {{is controlled by the}} ligands. Too much carbon in the ligand may promote formation of metal carbonate as a secondary <b>minor</b> <b>phase</b> since enormous amounts of CO2 are generated on combustion which may react with metal oxides. Too little carbon in the ligand will limit the solubility of precursor in alcohol. The process is inexpensive as metal oxides, hydroxides, carbonates or nitrates can be used as starting points for precursor synthesis. For mixed-metal oxides, one can either synthesize a double-alkoxide which contains two metal elements such as magnesium aluminum double alkoxide as shown in Table 1, or simply mix different alkoxide and/or carboxylates in stoichiometric ratios. For example, LF-FSP products of alumatrane and silatrane glycolate dissolved in ethanol at 3:1 molar ratio is mullite (3Al2O3•2SiO2). Stoichiometry of nanopowder made through LF-FSP corresponds to that of its precursor.|$|E
