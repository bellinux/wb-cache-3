60|$|The curate had {{possession}} of the slit when the first men {{were brought to the}} pit. I was sitting below, huddled up, listening with all my ears. He made a sudden <b>movement</b> <b>backward,</b> and I, fearful that we were observed, crouched in a spasm of terror. He came sliding down the rubbish and crept beside me in the darkness, inarticulate, gesticulating, and for a moment I shared his panic. His gesture suggested a resignation of the slit, and after a little while my curiosity gave me courage, and I rose up, stepped across him, and clambered up to it. At first I could see no reason for his frantic behaviour. The twilight had now come, the stars were little and faint, but the pit was illuminated by the flickering green fire that came from the aluminium-making. The whole picture was a flickering scheme of green gleams and shifting rusty black shadows, strangely trying to the eyes. Over and through it all went the bats, heeding it not at all. The sprawling Martians were no longer to be seen, the mound of blue-green powder had risen to cover them from sight, and a fighting-machine, with its legs contracted, crumpled, and abbreviated, stood across the corner of the pit. And then, amid the clangour of the machinery, came a drifting suspicion of human voices, that I entertained at first only to dismiss.|$|E

40|$|Based on psychophysical {{evidence}} about how learning of visuomotor transformation generalizes, {{it has been}} suggested that movements are planned on the basis of movement direction and magnitude, i. e., the vector connecting movement origin and targets. This notion is also known under the term “vectorial planning hypothesis”. Previous psychophysical studies, however, have included separate areas of the workspace for training movements and testing the learning. This study eliminates this confounding factor by investigating the transfer of learning from forward to <b>backward</b> <b>movements</b> in a center-out-and-back task, in which the workspace for both movements is completely identical. Visual feedback allowed for learning only during movements towards the target (forward movements) and not while moving back to the origin (<b>backward</b> <b>movements).</b> When subjects learned the visuomotor rotation in forward movements, initial directional errors in <b>backward</b> <b>movements</b> also decreased to some degree. This learning effect in <b>backward</b> <b>movements</b> occurred predominantly when <b>backward</b> <b>movements</b> featured the same movement directions as the ones trained in forward movements (i. e., when opposite targets were presented). This suggests that learning was transferred in a direction specific way, supporting the notion that movement direction is the most prominent parameter used for motor planning...|$|R
40|$|The terms “narrative ” and “development ” {{would appear}} to be {{difficult}} to relate to one another. While “narrative ” frequently connotes <b>movement</b> <b>backward</b> in time and would thus seem to be a retrospective concept, “development” connotes movement forward in time and would thus seem to be a prospective concept. In this article, I seek to rethink both of these terms {{in such a way as}} to render them more compatible. In doing so, I focus on the idea of narrative identity, which, I suggest, is not only about the self but about the other-than-self, especially those goods that draw the process forward...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{development}} of play itself through elucidation of the mode of being and the transformation of play, based on play theory by K. Nishimura and H-G. Gadamer. The fundamental sense of playing is the medial one; the basic structure of "play" is the <b>movement</b> <b>backward</b> and forward. In addition, "play" contains elements of self-presentation. Starting from concepts of "play" like these, the mode of being and transformation of "play" are examined through observing children's play episodes. The results suggest that the transformation of "play" itself is not single-track way used commonly in the sense of the word "development". It is necessary to reconstruct a developmental theory on "play" itself based on the appreciation of the mode of being of "play"...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to measure the energy {{expenditure}} for locomotor activities usually performed by soccer referees during a match (walking, jogging, and running) under laboratory conditions, and to compare forward with <b>backward</b> <b>movements.</b> The sample was composed by 10 male soccer referees, age 29 ± 7. 8 years, body mass 77. 5 ± 6. 2 kg, stature 1. 78 ± 0. 07 m and professional experience of 7. 33 ± 4. 92 years. Referees were evaluated on two separate occasions. On the first day, maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 max) was determined by a maximal treadmill test, and on the second day, the oxygen consumption was determined in different speeds of forward and <b>backward</b> <b>movements.</b> The mean VO 2 max was 41. 20 ± 3. 60 mL·kg- 1 ·min- 1 and the mean heart rate achieved in the last stage of the test was 190. 5 ± 7. 9 bpm. When results of forward and <b>backward</b> <b>movements</b> were compared at 1. 62 m/s (walking speed), we found significant differences in VO 2, in metabolic equivalents, and in kcal. However, the same parameters in forward and <b>backward</b> <b>movements</b> at jogging velocities (2. 46 m/s) were not significantly different, showing that these motor activities have similar intensity. <b>Backward</b> <b>movements</b> at velocities equivalent to walking and jogging are moderate-intensity activities, with energy expenditure less than 9 kcal. Energy expenditure was overestimated by at least 35 % when calculated by mathematical equations. In summary, we observed that <b>backward</b> <b>movements</b> are not high-intensity activities as has been commonly reported, and when calculated using equations available in the literature, energy expenditure was overestimated compared to the values obtained by indirect calorimetry...|$|R

40|$|Dance {{performances}} in ceremonial and other intercultural political encounters in north-east Arnhem Land strive to achieve several general goals: to achieve co-presence through forms of participation; to engage total attention through a <b>movement</b> <b>backward</b> and forward between {{different levels of}} intensity or feeling; and to express something beyond what is represented. How are we to talk about participation? What are its critical components? What is {{its role in the}} effectiveness of performances? In locating the meaning of Yolngu dance {{performances in}} aesthetic experience—a modality of participation—the author explores the nature of this participation as a doing that accomplishes itself in the single act of its production and reception. Beyond symbolism and structure, referential meaning and exegesis, the force of performance is in the first instance itself, in its very actualization, in the responsibility it demands of performer and public to create the conditions of possibility for the social to realize itself, through a series of investments involving reciprocal recognition, engagement, commitment and accountability...|$|E
40|$|Actin and myosin inhibitors often blocked {{anaphase}} {{movements in}} insect spermatocytes in previous experiments. Here we treat cells with an enhancer of myosin, Calyculin A, which inhibits myosin-light-chain phosphatase from dephosphorylating myosin; myosin thus is hyperactivated. Calyculin A causes anaphase crane-fly spermatocyte chromosomes to accelerate poleward; after {{they reach the}} poles they often move back toward the equator. When added during metaphase, chromosomes at anaphase move faster than normal. Calyculin A causes prometaphase chromosomes to move rapidly up and back along the spindle axis, and to rotate. Immunofluorescence staining with an antibody against phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain (p-squash) indicated increased phosphorylation of cleavage furrow myosin compared to control cells, indicating that calyculin A indeed increased myosin phosphorylation. To test whether the Calyculin A effects are due to myosin phosphatase or to type 2 phosphatases, we treated cells with okadaic acid, which inhibits protein phosphatase 2 A at concentrations similar to Calyculin A but requires much higher concentrations to inhibit myosin phosphatase. Okadaic acid {{had no effect on}} chromosome <b>movement.</b> <b>Backward</b> movements did not require myosin or actin since they were not affected by 2, 3 -butanedione monoxime or LatruculinB. Calyculin A affects the distribution and organization of spindle microtubules, spindle actin, cortical actin and putative spindle matrix proteins skeletor and titin, as visualized using immunofluorescence. We discuss how accelerated and backwards movements might arise...|$|E

40|$|Summary. -A {{method for}} {{estimating}} constancy during motion, {{described in a}} previous paper, is used to find the effect of proprioceptive information of O's movement on visual size constancy. Os were carried in darkness backward and forward on a swing, while their constancy was estimated. It was found that constancy was improved when Os received proprioceptive information of their movement. Constancy was greater for binocular than monocular viewing of the self-luminous display; and constancy was greater for forward than <b>backward</b> <b>movement.</b> It was shown in the preceding paper by Gregory and Ross (1964) that, when 0 was moving forward on a swing in the dark, visual size constancy was better than during <b>backward</b> <b>movement.</b> In that experiment 0 used only one eye, the other being covered. Further experiments were performed using a similar procedure to determine whether: (1) the use of both eyes gave better size constancy than use of one eye; (2) size constancy was better during forward than <b>backward</b> <b>movement</b> of the observer using both eyes; (3) {{the addition of a}} fixatio...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the neural}} {{circuits}} and genes that underlie behavior {{is a fundamental}} question {{in the field of}} neuroscience. While behaviors diverge across species, recent structural analysis of neural anatomy suggests that many patterns of neural connectivity are conserved across species. These neural motifs {{can be thought of as}} building blocks that may be increased or reconfigured to generate nervous system complexity. It can be difficult to define and characterize properties of neural circuits in complex systems, such as the human brain, which possesses an estimated 100 billion neurons and 3 trillion synapses. In contrast, with only 302 neurons and 7, 000 synapses, the genetic model, Caenorhabditis elegans, has become an attractive system to dissect how neural circuits and genes generate behavior. Caenorhabditis elegans exhibits a number of complex behaviors, all of which involve basic locomotion. During locomotion, worms initiate <b>backward</b> <b>movement</b> to change direction spontaneously or in response to sensory cues; however, the underlying neural circuits are not well defined. We applied a multidisciplinary approach to map neural circuits in freely behaving worms by integrating functional imaging, optogenetic interrogation, genetic manipulation, laser ablation, and electrophysiology. Using this approach, we discovered that the long standing model for <b>backward</b> <b>movement</b> in Caenorhabditis elegans required substantial revision. Previously, it was thought that a set of command interneurons acting as a stimulatory circuit were required to drive <b>backward</b> <b>movement.</b> We discovered that although important for execution and coordination, <b>backward</b> <b>movement</b> persisted in the absence of the command interneurons. Importantly, we identified a new disinhibitory circuit that acts in parallel to the stimulatory circuit to promote initiation of <b>backward</b> <b>movement</b> and that circuitry dynamics is differentially regulated by sensory cues. Both circuits require glutamatergic transmission but depend on distinct glutamate receptors. This dual mode of motor initiation control is found in mammals, suggesting that distantly related organisms with anatomically distinct nervous systems may adopt similar strategies for motor control. Additionally, our studies illustrate how a multidisciplinary approach facilitates dissection of circuit and synaptic mechanisms underlying behavior in a genetic model organism...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. Falls are a {{major problem}} in the elderly. Age-related {{degeneration}} of the human balance system increases the risk of falls. Kyphosis is a common condition of curvature of the upper spine in the elderly and its development occurs through degenerative change. However, relatively {{little is known about the}} effect of kyphotic changes on balance in the elderly. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of kyphosis on the balance strategy through use of the motor control test (MCT) in computerized dynamic posturography. Methods. Fifty healthy subjects who were not affected by other medical disorders that could affect gait or balance were enrolled in the study. By simulation of kyphotic condition through change of the angles of the line connecting the shoulder to the hip and the ankle axis by approximately 30 °, the latency and amplitude of the MCT were measured in upright and kyphotic condition. Results. In the kyphotic condition, latency was shortened in <b>backward</b> <b>movement.</b> In forward movement, latency was shortened only in large stimulation. The amplitude in forward movement was decreased in kyphotic condition. However, the change of amplitude was not significant in large intensity <b>backward</b> <b>movement</b> in the same condition. Conclusion. Kyphotic condition decreases the latency of MCT, especially in <b>backward</b> <b>movement.</b> These findings imply that kyphotic condition may serve as a protective factor against falls. Key Words.
