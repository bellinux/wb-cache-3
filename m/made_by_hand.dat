5|$|The first {{paper mill}} in Cullompton dates from 1729, with mills {{being set up}} near by at Hele and Higher Kensham in 1767, at Lower Kensahm c1788 and Langford c 1788. These would have been small water-powered vat mills, where paper was <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> {{generally}} by women and children. Records show that the mill in Cullompton was owned by a Mr Simon Mills in 1757 and {{was taken over by}} a Mr Theodore Dart in 1799. There followed a number of different owners of whom {{one of the most significant}} was Albert Reed who purchased the mill in 1883. His brother, William Reed, established a partnership with a Mr C King Smith.|$|E
5|$|Jakobsson {{served as}} the game's artist, designer, and programmer. His levels are <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> in a {{standalone}} level editor. The designer brushes recurring, cloned elements, such as plants and chains, onto the map. The software combines and processes to add shadow. At one point, Rain World included a multiplayer mode, and separate story and custom modes. Primate, who {{is also known as}} James Therrien, wrote Rain World soundtrack, handled the indie studio's business, and designed levels. Primate first found the game on an indie game Internet forum and sent Jakobsson 12 tracks as a successful pitch. He originally composed a chiptune-style soundtrack with his musician partner Lydia Esrig, but turned to field recordings of litter for otherworldly sounds. Rain World music is low-fi and electronic. Primate wanted the music to approximate the game's eclectic visuals, which mix industrial, science fiction, jungle, and various architectural elements. In lieu of traditional character dialogue and narration, Rain World story was partly communicated through its soundtrack. The early game sound is primitive and based on the Slugcat's feelings of fear and hunger, and eventually builds to describe new areas. Rain World has over 3.5 hours of recorded music across 160 tracks. At any given time, between eight and twelve tracks will simultaneously layer to create ambiance and respond to the Slugcat's in-game context. The development team successfully crowdfunded some development costs via Kickstarter in early 2014. By early 2015, about four years into development, the team had switched to the Unity game engine and released a test version of the game to its Kickstarter backers.|$|E

25|$|In Mexico, {{particularly}} in the towns and cities, corn tortillas are often made nowadays by machine and are very thin and uniform, but in many places in the country, they are still <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> even when the nixtamal is ground into masa by machine. In Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, or Honduras, they are still often <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> and are thicker. Corn tortillas are customarily served and eaten warm; when cool, they often become rubbery or grainy as the cooked starches stale. The largest tortilla producer {{in the world is}} the Mexican company Gruma, headquartered in Monterrey.|$|E

Choctaw dresses are trimmed by full diamond, half diamond or circle, and crosses that represent stickball sticks.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} in Sutton, Massachusetts. He had a fondness for {{mechanical}} employment, and was associated with his brother {{in the manufacture of}} tacks by hand. This process was exceedingly slow and tedious, and his first machine, made and patented in 1806, was a mechanical tack-maker, which could fabricate five hundred tacks per minute, each much better than tacks <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand.</b> He sold the rights to his machine for $5,000.|$|E
25|$|From the {{beginning}} of civilization, when pottery and mudbricks were <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> to now, mudrocks have been important.

25|$|The major {{center for}} {{ceramics}} {{in the state}} is the city of Amatenango del Valle, with its barro blanco (white clay) pottery. The most traditional ceramic in Amatenango and Aguacatenango {{is a type of}} large jar called a cantaro used to transport water and other liquids. Many pieces created from this clay are ornamental as well as traditional pieces for everyday use such as comals, dishes, storage containers and flowerpots. All pieces here are <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> using techniques that go back centuries. Other communities that produce ceramics include Chiapa de Corzo, Tonalá, Ocuilpa, Suchiapa and San Cristóbal de las Casas.|$|E
25|$|As {{time passed}} and the method moved more into the {{mainstream}} some disagreement arose as to {{the problems associated with}} cutting off air to skin contact, and also some improvements were made. Eventually Pirogov's method gave way to Mathijsen's. Among the improvements suggested as early as 1860 was that of making the dressing resistant to water by painting the dried plaster of Paris with a mixture of shellac dissolved in alcohol. The first commercial bandages were not produced until 1931 in Germany, and were called Cellona. Before that the bandages were <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> at the hospitals.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{invention}} and current widespread adoption of automated machinery, all paper was <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> formed or laid one sheet {{at a time}} by specialized laborers. Even today those who make paper by hand use tools and technologies quite similar to those existing hundreds of years ago, as originally developed in China and Asia, or those further modified in Europe. Handmade paper is still appreciated for its distinctive uniqueness and the skilled craft involved in making each sheet, {{in contrast with the}} higher degree of uniformity and perfection at lower prices achieved among industrial products.|$|E

25|$|The {{most famous}} modern {{metalwork}} {{of the state}} is the hammered copper of Santa Clara del Cobre, founded in 1530 as a smelter for the nuns of the order of Saint Claire. The foundry is gone but the work in the metal continues, with the making of copper tubs, vats, ladles, trays, sinks, basins, kegs, vases, pots, plates, jars, jewelry and more. Nearly all the copper used is from recycled materials. All are <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> using only hand tools such as mallets, hammers, sledge hammers, anvils and chisels, which work metal heated in wood fired furnaces. Each year the artisans show off their handwork at the Feria Nacional del Cobre.|$|E
25|$|Lehovec tested {{his idea}} using the {{technologies}} of making transistors {{that were available}} at Sprague. His device was a linear structure 2.2×0.5×0.1mm in size, which was divided into isolated n-type cells (bases of the future transistors) by p-n junctions. Layers and transitions were formed by growth from the melt. The conductivity type {{was determined by the}} pulling speed of the crystal: an indium-rich p-type layer was formed at a slow speed, whereas an arsenic-rich n-type layer was produced at a high speed. The collectors and emitters of the transistors were created by welding indium beads. All electrical connections were <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> using gold wires.|$|E
25|$|Ice cream was <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> in a {{large bowl}} placed inside a tub filled with ice and salt. This was called the pot-freezer method. French confectioners refined the pot-freezer method, making ice cream in a sorbetière (a covered pail with a handle {{attached}} to the lid). In the pot-freezer method, the temperature of the ingredients is reduced by the mixture of crushed ice and salt. The salt water is cooled by the ice, and the action of the salt on the ice causes it to (partially) melt, absorbing latent heat and bringing the mixture below the freezing point of pure water. The immersed container can also make better thermal contact with the salty water and ice mixture than it could with ice alone.|$|E

25|$|Jansson {{arrived in}} New York in June 1846 {{and with the}} help of 400 of his {{followers}} who had survived the journey, founded the Bishop Hill Colony in Henry County, Illinois. He named the colony after his Swedish birthplace. Although many died in the first winter, others continued to arrive from Sweden. The villagers lived as a collective religious colony for 15 years, from 1846 to 1861, tilling the soil, tending their animals, and building their settlement with bricks that they <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand.</b> Some local pioneers were amazed by their lifestyle and the relative success that it generated. Jansson sent nine of his followers to California in 1850, hoping that they would prospect successfully during the California Gold Rush. It was hoped that this additional wealth would help support their community.|$|E
25|$|Mayonnaise can be <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> with a whisk, or fork, or {{with the}} aid of an {{electric}} mixer or blender. It is made by slowly adding oil to an egg yolk, while whisking vigorously to disperse the oil. The oil and the water in the yolk form a base of the emulsion, while lecithin and protein from the yolk is the emulsifier that stabilizes it. A combination of van der Waals interactions and electrostatic repulsion determine the bond strength among oil droplets. The high viscosity of mayonnaise is attributed to the total strength created by these two intermolecular forces. Addition of mustard contributes to the taste and further stabilizes the emulsion, as mustard contains small amounts of lecithin. If vinegar is added directly to the yolk, it can emulsify more oil, thus making more mayonnaise.|$|E
25|$|Until the 19th century, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of butter was <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> on farms. The first butter factories appeared in the United States in the early 1860s, after the successful introduction of cheese factories a decade earlier. In the late 1870s, the centrifugal cream separator was introduced, marketed most successfully by Swedish engineer Carl Gustaf Patrik de Laval. This dramatically sped up the butter-making process by eliminating the slow step of letting cream naturally rise to the top of milk. Initially, whole milk was shipped to the butter factories, and the cream separation took place there. Soon, though, cream-separation technology became small and inexpensive enough to introduce an additional efficiency: the separation was accomplished on the farm, and the cream alone shipped to the factory. By 1900, more than half the butter produced in the United States was factory made; Europe followed suit shortly after.|$|E
