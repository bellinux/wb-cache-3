Still, I can easily imagine a more dashing, charismatic Phantom than Butler's. Rest assured, however, Lloyd Webber's neo-Puccinian songs are reprised and reprised and reprised until you're guaranteed to go out humming."

Of her performance, one critic wrote: [...] "Peters <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> traditional casting for Sally, now an ultraneurotic housewife in Phoenix, but she exquisitely captures the character's unfathomable sadness and longing. It's a star turn, for sure, but one that brings attention to itself because of its truthfulness. Not surprisingly, her rendition of 'Losing My Mind' is simply shattering." [...] She reprised her role of Sally in the Broadway limited engagement, at the Marquis Theatre, from August 2011 to January 2012. She received a nomination for the Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Actress in a Musical, for this role.|$|E

[...] Freedom De Luc from The Washington Post described the song as an [...] "emotive ballad", while Nekesa Mumbi Moody from Foster's Daily Democrat noted [...] "it could have been recorded in her early '90s heyday — except it's not as saccharine as some of her early work".

[...] Gerald Villoria of GameSpy considered the game to be [...] "dedicated to an unabashed love of metal" [...] and [...] "heavy metal fan-service to the highest degree". Davis believed that the juxtaposition of all the elements {{that made up the}} heavy metal fantasy world were the game's greatest strength, often being [...] "both giddily ridiculous and fist-pumpingly badass" [...] at the same time. Critics found that while the graphics for the game <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> sophisticated for the current console generation, the detailed art aspects of the world were impressive; Varanini considered that [...] "no matter where you are in the world, there's always some cool object to look at", while Donlan considered the world to be a [...] "constant unfolding delight". The incorporation of heavy metal music into the game also benefited the game. Both Kelly and Villoria considered the soundtrack essential to the game, and praised the moments where specific songs, such as Dragonforce's [...] "Through the Fire and Flames" [...] would be used as background music during specific game sequences. Kelly further praised the game for using the songs to define the action of the game instead of relegated to random background music. Villoria also considered the soundtrack to have [...] "enormous breadth of sound and diversity", introducing the player to heavy metal genres they may not have known even existed. G4TV's Jake Gaskill considered listening to the soundtrack to be the equivalent of [...] "taking a class in heavy metal appreciation." ...|$|E

2500|$|Different {{findings}} emerge when {{observed and}} self-report procrastination are compared. Steel et al. constructed their own scales based on Silver and Sabini’s [...] "irrational" [...] and [...] "postponement" [...] criteria. They {{also sought to}} measure this behavior objectively. During a course, students could complete exam practice computer exercises at their own pace, and during the supervised class time could also complete chapter quizzes. A weighted average of the times at which each quiz was finished formed the measure of observed procrastination, whilst observed irrationality was quantified {{with the number of}} practice exercises that were left uncompleted. Researchers found that there was only a moderate correlation between observed and self-reported procrastination (r = 0.35). There was a very strong inverse relationship between the number of exercises completed and the measure of postponement (r = −0.78). Observed procrastination was very strongly negatively correlated with course grade (r = −0.87), as was self-reported procrastination (though less so, r = −0.36). As such, self-reported measures of procrastination, on which the majority of the literature is based, <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> appropriate measure to use in all cases.
