5|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} are being studied for <b>multidrug-resistant</b> <b>tuberculosis,</b> including bedaquiline and delamanid. Bedaquiline received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in late 2012. The {{safety and effectiveness}} of these new agents are still uncertain, because {{they are based on}} the results of a relatively small studies. However, existing data suggest that patients taking bedaquiline in addition to standard TB therapy are five times more likely to die than those without the new drug, which has resulted in medical journal articles raising health policy questions about why the FDA approved the drug and whether financial ties to the company making bedaquiline influenced physicians' support for its use.|$|E

25|$|Tuberculosis is a {{major public}} health problem in China. China has the world's third largest cases of {{tuberculosis}} (after India and Indonesia), but progress in tuberculosis control was slow during the 1990s. Detection of tuberculosis had stagnated at around 30% of the estimated total of new cases, and <b>multidrug-resistant</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> was a major problem. These signs of inadequate tuberculosis control {{can be linked to}} a malfunctioning health system. The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, brought to light substantial weaknesses in the country's public health system. After the government realized the impact that the SARS outbreak had on the country, they increased leadership in their health department. After the SARS epidemic was brought under control, the government increased its commitment and leadership to tackle public health problems and, among other efforts, increased public health funding, revised laws that concerned the control of infectious diseases, implemented the world's largest internet-based disease reporting system to improve transparency, reach and speed, and started a program to rebuild local public health facilities and national infrastructure.|$|E

40|$|South Africa has a {{heavy burden}} of {{tuberculosis}} (TB) which is exacerbated by the concurrent epidemic of HIV. Molecular techniques {{have been used in}} most developed countries to investigate the dynamics of the TB epidemic, but despite the high prevalence of TB in sub-Saharan Africa, little data on strain types are available outside of the Western Cape. This study aims to provide information on the genotypic characteristics of <b>multidrug-resistant</b> (MDR) Mycobacterium <b>tuberculosis</b> strains in Johannesburg. Patient data obtained from the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) referral TB diagnostic laboratory and from Sizwe hospital, a MDR-TB referral hospital, were used to determine the risk factors for treatment outcomes in patients with MDR <b>tuberculosis.</b> <b>Multidrug-resistant</b> M. <b>tuberculosis</b> isolates from over 100 clinics and hospitals in Johannesburg were stored for the study.

40|$|The rise of <b>multidrug-resistant</b> Mycobacterium <b>tuberculosis</b> has {{complicated}} {{therapy for}} tuberculosis and {{led us to}} search for a potentially active combination of drugs against these strains. The susceptibilities of 12 strains of <b>multidrug-resistant</b> M. <b>tuberculosis</b> to standard antituberculous drugs (isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide), clarithromycin, and its metabolite, 14 -hydroxyclarithromycin, were determined by use of the BACTEC radiometric method. All strains were resistant to {{at least two of the}} antituberculous drugs. Clarithromycin and 14 -hydroxyclarithromycin MICs were in the range indicating resistance at > or = 8. 0 micrograms/ml for all strains. Combination testing by the BACTEC method was performed with various concentrations of isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol, and with clarithromycin/ 14 -hydroxyclarithromycin at fixed concentrations of 2. 0 / 0. 5 micrograms/ml, respectively. Addition of clarithromycin/ 14 -hydroxyclarithromycin to these antituberculous drug mixtures resulted in a 4 - to 32 -fold reduction in MICs of isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol and made resistant strains susceptible. Fractional inhibitory concentrations ranged from 0. 23 to 0. 50 for all strains, suggesting a synergistic interaction between standard antituberculous drugs and clarithromycin/ 14 -hydroxyclarithromycin. The ability of clarithromycin/ 14 -hydroxyclarithromycin to enhance the activities of isoniazid, ethambutol, and rifampin in vitro suggests that this combination may be efficacious in the treatment of <b>multidrug-resistant</b> M. <b>tuberculosis</b> infections...|$|R
