Ljungberg, who scored in five of Arsenal's last eight league matches, as well as the second goal in the cup final, was given the Barclaycard Player of the Year accolade. Pirès was named the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year, with five votes separating himself from Ruud van Nistelrooy; he said it was [...] "a great honour" [...] to receive the award, adding: [...] "Times have been difficult with my injury, but this has given <b>me</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> smile about." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Inside Out" [...] is an electropop {{song that}} {{features}} themes of dubstep and R, complimented with [...] "earth-shattering synths". Lyrically, the [...] "sexy breakup song", {{as described by}} Jocelyn Vena of MTV, opens with Spears singing, [...] "Said you're gonna {{be here in a}} minute/ Sitting in the mirror getting pretty/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ I can hear you knocking at the front door/ And I know exactly what you came for/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy." [...] While the couple seems {{to be on the verge}} of a breakup, there's apparently still some sexual tension between them, which is perceived in lines such as [...] "You ... touch me and it's breaking me down/ I'm telling you, let's just give it up and get down." [...] Spears crescendos [...] "So come on/Won't you give <b>me</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> remember/Baby shut your mouth and turn me inside out." [...] during the chorus section, and then goes on to [...] "Hit me one more time it's so amazing" [...] and [...] "You're the only one who's ever drove me crazy" [...] referencing her first singles [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998) and [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] (1999). The song was compared to her earlier work on albums In the Zone (2003) and Circus (2008) and it has been compared to that of Madonna's Ray of Light (1998) and Music (2000). The [...] "futuristic-sounding, slow-grooving tune" [...] was also considered reminiscent of Janet Jackson.|$|E

I also {{have to have a}} doctor {{standing}} by should something give, but I'm going to tape it up, and I'm going to get out there." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, {{he founded}} the Silverlake Conservatory of Music, a school {{dedicated}} to help youth progress in music, because of this. [...] "I just wanted {{to fill the void}} that public education has cut from their curriculum. They've dropped the ball by cutting out music programs", Flea laments, [...] "I grew up in LA public schools and was in the music department. It was really an important thing for my life, it gave <b>me</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> hold onto, and it was an important access for me. Without music I would've gotten into a lot of trouble {{and there are a lot}} of kids like me out there. I just wanted to try to provide something like what I got." [...] Flea felt the public school system was seriously lacking in exposing children to music by drastically reducing, and sometimes eliminating, art-related programs.|$|E
2500|$|Around age eleven, Mary Albert {{moved to}} a one-room house on Perdido Street with Louis, her {{daughter}} Lucy, and her common-law husband, Tom Lee. They lived next door to Mary Albert's brother Ike and his two sons. After {{dropping out of the}} Fisk School in 1912, Armstrong joined a quartet of boys who sang in the streets for money. He also started to get into trouble. Cornet player Bunk Johnson said he taught Armstrong (then 11) to play by ear at Dago Tony's Tonk in New Orleans, although in his later years Armstrong gave the credit to Oliver. Armstrong hardly looked back at his youth as the worst of times but drew inspiration from it instead: [...] "Every time I close my eyes blowing that trumpet of mine—I look right in the heart of good old New Orleans... It has given <b>me</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> live for." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{interviewed by}} Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone in 1995, Jagger stated that Taylor never {{explained}} {{why he had}} left, and surmised that [...] " [...] {{wanted to have a}} solo career. I think he found it difficult to get on with Keith." [...] In the same interview Jagger said of Taylor's contribution to the band: [...] "I think he had a big contribution. He made it very musical. He was a very fluent, melodic player, which we never had, and we don't have now. Neither Keith nor Ronnie Wood plays that kind of style. It was very good for me working with him ... Mick Taylor would play very fluid lines against my vocals. He was exciting, and he was very pretty, and it gave <b>me</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> follow, to bang off. Some people think that's the best version of the band that existed". Asked if he agreed with that assessment, Jagger said: [...] "I obviously can't say if I think Mick Taylor was the best, because it sort of trashes the period the band is in now." [...] Charlie Watts stated: [...] "I think we chose the right man for the job at that time just as Ronnie was the right man for the job later on. I still think Mick is great. I haven't heard or seen him play in a few years. But certainly what came out of playing with him are musically some of the best things we've ever done". Another statement in Guitar World in October 2002 made by Richards said [...] "Mick Taylor and I worked really well together ... He had some lovely energy. Sweetly sophisticated playing, way beyond his years. Lovely sense of melody. I never understood why he left the Stones, Nor does he, I think ... I had no desire to see him go." [...] Taylor later admitted in the 2012 documentary Crossfire Hurricane that he had become addicted to heroin and hoped to protect his family from the drug culture surrounding the band by leaving.|$|E
