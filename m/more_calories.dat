5|$|Tyrannosaurs {{had large}} {{olfactory}} bulbs and olfactory nerves (relative to their brain size). These suggest a highly developed {{sense of smell}} which could sniff out carcasses over great distances, as modern vultures do. Research on the olfactory bulbs of dinosaurs has shown that Tyrannosaurus had the most highly developed sense of smell of 21 sampled dinosaurs. Opponents of the pure scavenger hypothesis have used the example of vultures in the opposite way, arguing that the scavenger hypothesis is implausible because the only modern pure scavengers are large gliding birds, which use their keen senses and energy-efficient gliding to cover vast areas economically. Researchers from Glasgow concluded that an ecosystem as productive as the current Serengeti would provide sufficient carrion for a large theropod scavenger, although the theropod might {{have had to be}} cold-blooded in order to get <b>more</b> <b>calories</b> from carrion than it spent on foraging (see Metabolism of dinosaurs). They also suggested that modern ecosystems like the Serengeti have no large terrestrial scavengers because gliding birds now do the job much more efficiently, while large theropods did not face competition for the scavenger ecological niche from gliding birds.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is calculated}} by a dietitian for each child. Age, weight, activity levels, culture and food preferences all affect the meal plan. First, the energy requirements are set at 80–90% of the recommended daily amounts (RDA) for the child's age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children {{or those with}} muscle spasticity require <b>more</b> <b>calories</b> than this; immobile children require less. The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18months, older than 12years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is energy-rich, with 9kcal/g (38kJ/g) compared to 4kcal/g (17kJ/g) for carbohydrate or protein, so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal. The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any carbohydrate in medications or supplements must be subtracted from this allowance. The total daily amount of fat, protein and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals.|$|E

25|$|This verse {{has caused}} some {{to ask if}} meat should be eaten in the summer. Meat has <b>more</b> <b>calories</b> than fruits and vegetables, which some {{individuals}} may need fewer of in summer than winter. Also, before fruits and vegetables could be preserved, people often {{did not have enough}} other food to eat in winter. Spoiled meat can be fatal if eaten, and in former times meat spoiled more readily in summer than winter. Modern methods of refrigeration now make it possible to preserve meat in any season. The key word with respect to the use of meat is sparingly.|$|E
25|$|Dog treats given {{excessively}} {{can be a}} {{cause of}} obesity. The type of food fed has a direct bearing on the tendency of a dog to become overweight. Table scraps, treats, even premium high-energy dog foods can contribute to obesity. Therefore, it is highly important to closely monitor the quantity of treats that a dog gets especially when the dog's activity is diminished. Dog treats {{are more likely to}} be linked to obesity in old dogs, since in their old age they are less likely to be active and exercising. On the other hand, active dogs require and use <b>more</b> <b>calories,</b> so dog treats are not a cause of concern in younger and highly active dogs.|$|E
5000|$|A proper diet is also {{essential}} to healthy weight gain. The common saying [...] "a woman is eating for two" [...] {{often leads to}} mothers thinking that they should eat twice as much. In reality, only a small increase in caloric intake is needed {{to provide for the}} fetus; approximately 350 <b>calories</b> <b>more</b> in the second trimester and 450 <b>calories</b> <b>more</b> in the third trimester. Also, healthy choices should be emphasized for these extra calories such as whole grain products, fruits and vegetables as well as low-fat dairy alternatives.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to this, {{the way that}} an individual responds to stress can influence their health status. Often, individuals responding to chronic stress will develop coping behaviours, {{some of which have}} a positive influences on health and others which have a negative influence. People who cope with stress through positive behaviours such as exercise or social connections may not be as affected by the relationship between stress and health, whereas those with a coping style more prone to over consumption (i.e. emotional eating, drinking, smoking or drug use) {{are more likely to be}} see negative health effects of stress. For example, a laboratory study has shown that, while stress did not alter calorie intake or food type eaten when averaged across the sample as a whole, when looking at a subset of the sample who were classed as emotional eaters, high stress levels were associated with eating more high fat and sweet food and a <b>more</b> <b>calorie</b> dense meal overall. Therefore, the authors conclude that stress may compromise the health of certain susceptible individuals (I.e those with an emotional eating coping style).|$|R
5000|$|In the US the FDA {{is moving}} towards {{establishing}} uniform guidelines for fast food and restaurant labeling, proposed rules {{were published in}} 2011 and final regulations published on 1 December 2014 which supersede State and local menu-labeling provisions, going into effect 1 December 2015. Research {{has shown that the}} new labels may influence consumer choices, but primarily if it provides unexpected information and that health-conscious consumers are resistant to changing behaviors based on menu labeling [...] Fast food restaurants are expected by the ERS to do better under the new menu labeling than full service restaurants as full service restaurants tend to offer much <b>more</b> <b>calorie</b> dense foods, with 50% of fast food meals being between 400 and 800 calories and less than 20% above 1000 calories, in contrast full service restaurants 20% of meals are above 1,400 calories. When consumers are aware of the calorie counts at full service restaurants 20% choose lower calorie options and consumers also reduce their calorie intake over the rest of the day.|$|R
25|$|Farming, which, {{the authors}} note, {{produces}} 10 to 100 times <b>more</b> <b>calories</b> per acre than foraging, carried this trend further. Over {{the period from}} 10,000 BC to AD 1, the world population increased about a hundredfold - estimates range from 40 to 170 times. An accelerated rate of evolution {{is a direct result}} of the larger human population. More people will have more mutations, thereby increasing opportunity for evolutionary change under natural selection. The spread of rapidly expanding populations eventually outpaced the spread of favourable mutations under selection in those populations, so for the ﬁrst time in human history favourable mutations could not fully disperse throughout the human species. In addition, of course, selection pressures changed once farming was adopted, favouring distinctive adaptations in different geographic areas.|$|E

500|$|Rhythm {{games have}} been used for health purposes. For example, {{research}} has found that dancing games dramatically increase energy expenditure over that of traditional video games, and that they burn <b>more</b> <b>calories</b> than walking on a treadmill. Scientists have further suggested that, due to the large amount of time children spend playing video games and watching television, games that involve physical activity could be used to combat obesity. Studies have found that playing Dance Dance Revolution can provide an aerobic workout, in terms of a sufficiently intense heart rate, but not the minimum levels of VO2 max. Based on successful preliminary studies, West Virginia, which {{has one of the highest}} rates of obesity and its attendant diseases in the US, introduced Dance Dance Revolution into its schools' physical education classes. According to The New York Times, more than [...] "several hundred schools in at least 10 states" [...] have used Dance Dance Revolution (along with In the Groove) in their curricula. Plans have been made to increase the number into the thousands in an effort to mitigate the country's obesity epidemic. Arnold Schwarzenegger, former Governor of California, was a noted proponent of the game's use in schools. In Japan, celebrities reported losing weight after playing Dance Dance Revolution, which drove sales of the game's home console version. Bemani's testers also found themselves losing weight while working on the game. There is further anecdotal evidence that these games aid weight loss, though the University of Michigan Health System has cautioned that dance games and other exergames should only be a starting point towards traditional sports, which are more effective. Dance games have also been used in rehabilitation and fall-prevention programs for elderly patients, using customised, slower versions of existing games and mats. Researchers have further experimented with prototypes of games allowing wider and more realistic stepping than the tapping actions found in commercial dance games.|$|E

40|$|Cuban {{tree frogs}} (Osteopilus septentrionalis), {{introduced}} and {{established in the}} southeastern US, have a varied diet that includes predation and herbivory. Their success may be partially attributable to predation on native anurans, as both larva and adults. Cuban tree frogs’ feeding strategy extends to eating conspecifics, resulting in cannibalism. However there may be trade-offs with cannibalism, including a risk of species-specific pathogen exposure. A carnivorous diet is <b>more</b> <b>calorie</b> dense than a vegetarian diet; others have shown that predation increases growth rate and size at metamorphosis. We hypothesize {{that in addition to}} increased growth parameters, nutrition associated with predation confers immunological advantages, such as increased circulating immune cells, which could mitigate any increase in exposure to pathogens. To test whether Cuban tree frog tadpoles benefit immunologically from predation, tadpoles were fed one of six feeding regimes consisting of mixtures of dehydrated tadpole and rabbit chow in ratios of 100 / 0 to 0 / 100. After 6 weeks, blood was collected and immune cells (lymphocytes, thrombocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils and basophils) were quantified per 5000 red blood cells. If cannibalism increases circulating immune cells, Cuban tree frogs’ success as an invasive species may be attributable to direct and indirect benefits from facultative predation by larvae...|$|R
