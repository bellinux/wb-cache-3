The Washington Blade printed a guest editorial from a long-time HRC supporter who claimed that neither recipient had done enough to deserve the award and that The Human Rights Campaign was simply capitalizing on Bass's fame to sell tickets. The Human Rights Campaign stood by Bass and defended his award, responding to critics by saying, [...] "Bass is the biggest music star since Melissa Etheridge to come out, and <b>maybe</b> <b>some</b> people think HRC should just ignore these moments of cultural significance, but his declaration did initiate a positive, national conversation that continues today." ...|$|E

Woodburne has said that her favourite storyline has been the Susan, Karl and Izzy love triangle. As Susan is normally a good person, it gave her a chance to have a character (Izzy) that she could hate. Woodburne added [...] "It was good to play those much meaner, darker, angrier, cruel moments than always to be the kind character. It was good to see those dents in her armour I think".|$|E
500|$|Avatar: The Last Airbender was co-created and {{produced}} by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko at Nickelodeon Animation Studios in Burbank, California. Its animation was primarily done by three South Korean studios: JM Animation, DR Movie, and MOI Animation. According to Konietzko, {{the series was}} conceived {{in the spring of}} 2001 when he took an old sketch of a balding, middle-aged man and imagined the character as a child. He drew the character herding bison in the sky, and showed the sketch to DiMartino. At the time, DiMartino was watching a documentary about explorers trapped at the South Pole. Konietzko described their early development of the concept: [...] "There's an air guy along with these water people trapped in a snowy wasteland ... and <b>maybe</b> <b>some</b> fire people are pressing down on them ..." [...] The co-creators successfully pitched the idea to Nickelodeon vice president and executive producer Eric Coleman two weeks later. The series was introduced to the public in a teaser reel at Comic-Con 2004, and premiered on February 21, 2005.|$|E

Following the third practice session, Harvick stated, [...] "We didn't put up a fast lap but it never slows down. I'm really excited." [...] Afterward, Johnson commented [...] "We struggled a little bit maybe in the first practice. But I found a good direction and started making some good gains there at the end.

According to Manson, its title was [...] "something I said to a girl because of her complexion—with black hair, red lips and pale skin. I mean, it was a complex and poetic statement which soon led to intercourse, so I felt no reason for it to be seen as hateful or destructive." [...] At the insistence of Interscope Records, the song was re-titled on the album's back cover. Manson was critical of this censorship, saying: [...] "Rather than take it off the album, I decided to produce it on the sleeve with a different name, so it'll be sold in Walmart or wherever stores sell guns but are afraid to deal with lyrics. So I put [...] "Pretty as a ($)", because all of their motivations are based on money."

The album was primarily recorded at Stankonia Recording Studio in Atlanta, Georgia, the studio used by OutKast for their previous albums. Additional recording took place at The Dungeon Recording Studios, The Slumdrum Dreamhouse, and King of Crunk in Atlanta, Dungeon East Studios in Decatur, Georgia, Instrumental Zoo in Miami, Florida, and Kush Studios in Palm Island, Florida. Big Boi discussed the Stankonia studio's environment in an interview for The Guardian, calling it [...] "comfortable but gritty enough to get you in a state of mind of being raw and ready to kill stuff", while noting that the sessions were accompanied by [...] "some candles, a little red light, <b>maybe</b> <b>some</b> crunk juice and a cigar; every now and then perhaps a little 'purple'". While searching for a new record label, he completed recording for the album. The album was mastered on May 27, 2010.|$|E

500|$|Gordon {{decided that}} to make [...] "time travel in an X-Files way", the best way was with [...] "a guy {{that turns out to}} be you". He {{therefore}} added the plot about a regretful scientist trying to stop developments from ever occurring. The scientist's character was inspired by a story Gordon heard about Manhattan Project physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer berating Harry S. Truman on the 1945 atomic bombings of Japan, and the writer wondered [...] "What if Oppenheimer could go back to the past and 'uninvent' the bomb?". Eventually Gordon and Greenwalt found another philosophical question that becomes Jason's motivation to halt his own research—"Life itself is about the unknown and discovering what is in front of us. But if everyone, or <b>maybe</b> <b>some</b> people, knew what would happen, that would create a new set of horrors, and it would need to be stopped".

[...] Music writer Richard Goldstein relates his impression of Wilson based on a meeting in 1967: [...] "He came across as ... deeply insecure about his creative instincts, terrified that the songs he was working on were too arty to sell." [...] Ultimately, Wilson put an end to the Smile project once he felt he did not have a [...] "commercial feeling about some of these songs ... <b>Maybe</b> <b>some</b> people like to hang on to certain songs as their own little songs that they've written, almost for themselves.

According to writer Scott Schinder, the album was released to [...] "general incomprehension.

500|$|As {{the show}} {{is based on the}} uncensored novel {{released}} in 2011, rather than the 1953 film adaptation, it contains references to prostitution and gay sex, as well as the Army's investigation into them, that the film did not feature. The right to create the musical adaptation came with the condition {{that it had to be}} based on the original book. James Jones's daughter Kaylie and son Jamie were in the audience for the show's opening night in London. During its preview period some people walked out of the performance, having been unprepared for the nudity and swearing in the production. Darius Campbell who played First Sergeant Milt Warden, said that the [...] "James Jones novel really portrayed homosexuality and prostitution in the way that it existed in those days and we've dived in head first. <b>Maybe</b> <b>some</b> of the nudity, swearing and explicitness have been too much for them, but a younger audience and an audience who have loved the film – and wanted to see more – have been giving us standing ovations and for that we are all grateful." [...] Kaylie admitted they had doubts about the idea of the show when it first came up, but added that [...] "I'm thrilled—it's so sophisticated and moving." [...] She also noted that she [...] "was so delighted they put in the gay bar scenes, because my dad said this is just the way it was back then" [...] and that [...] "my father would have been amazed".|$|E

500|$|Some reviewers {{still felt}} that Lightning Bolt was {{not up to}} the {{standards}} set by the band's previous work. Blue Sullivan of Slant Magazine gave the album three out of five stars, saying that the album had a [...] "familiar spark" [...] and was dragged down by [...] "Pearl Jam's antiseptic '70s-album-rock-radio conservatism, along with frontman Eddie Vedder's ham-fisted lyrics", ultimately concluding that [...] "Lightning Bolt is no masterwork. Years removed from the raw emotion and desperate appetites of youth, Pearl Jam has slipped into alt-rock elder statesmanship as one would a comfortable old sweater." [...] Rob Harvilla of Spin gave the album a six out of ten, describing it as [...] "far from an implosion, far from spectacular", criticizing the focus on calm songs and considering that Backspacer [...] "barked louder and bit harder overall." [...] In his 5.0 out of 10 review for Pitchfork, Stuart Berman also had a negative reaction to what he described as [...] "centerpiece ballads [...] tread on odious Lite-FM territory and forcefully tip the scales from poignant to maudlin". Philip Cosores of Paste gave the album a 4.0 out of 10, saying [...] "The album does grow on the listener, as Vedder's voice and the band's seeming ambivalence to all musical trends and developments outside of them is strangely comforting. And <b>maybe</b> <b>some</b> of these songs will come alive when performed, but {{there is not a single}} one to love in the set. Essentially, the cruise control is running onward with disregard for all the maintenance and repairs that an engine needs, and the result is the worst album of their career." ...|$|E
500|$|Marceline is {{voiced by}} Olivia Olson. Olivia's father Martin Olson was an {{acquaintance}} of Ward, and Olivia was encouraged to audition for Adventure Time after Ward told her father that he wanted [...] "her as a voice" [...] on his show. She had originally auditioned {{for the role of}} Princess Bubblegum. After her initial audition, she was asked to read for the role of Marceline, and was [...] "definitely impressed by the character" [...] after seeing design drawings. Martin Olson later noted that Olivia's audition was a [...] "sham" [...] to please the network executives because Ward had already wanted her to be a voice on the show. In order to get into character, Olson often dresses {{in a manner similar to}} Marceline when she records her lines; she explained, [...] "I always find ... that on the days that I go in to record Marceline, I’ll dress like her, in a weird way ... I’ll throw on some rock n’ roll boots, <b>maybe</b> <b>some</b> red lipstick, and just go in there." [...] Olson also is the character's singing voice. According to storyboard artist Cole Sanchez, composers Casey James Basichis and Tim Kiefer produce the bass music that the character performs in the series. Many of the songs written for Marceline were uploaded onto the internet by the writers as well as the production company. For instance, Rob Sugar—the father of former storyboard artist Rebecca Sugar—often uploaded demos of songs written for Marceline by Rebecca. Furthermore, Frederator also posted demos, as well as a full version of the popular [...] "Fry Song", sung by Marceline in the episode [...] "It Came from the Nightosphere", on its official blog. In flashback sequences, younger Marceline is voiced by Ava Acres. In the fifth season episodes [...] "Finn the Human" [...] / [...] "Jake the Dog", an older, alternate universe version of the character is voiced by Cloris Leachman. Martin Olson also provides the voice for Marceline's demonic father Hunson Abadeer. Olivia Olson later noted that the opportunity to voice act with her father was [...] "pretty cool”.|$|E
