50|$|A noise {{weighting}} {{is a specific}} amplitude-vs.-frequency characteristic {{that is designed to}} allow subjectively valid <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise.</b> It emphasises the parts of the spectrum that are most important.|$|E
50|$|The proper <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> {{therefore}} {{requires the}} use of a specified method, with defined measurement bandwidth and weighting curve, and rectifier dynamics. The two main methods defined by current standards are A-weighting and ITU-R 468(formerly known as CCIR weighting).|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{human population}} and {{the increasing number of}} vehicles in Tirana, Albania, emerges the need for extensive <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> levels. The 831 <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> levels were taken in Tirana in November 2015 for education purposes. Measurements were collected in eight locations in indoor like a classroom in a school building environment, a library and a healthcare facility and in outdoor environments like five crossroads. Noise levels were then compared with domestic and World Health Organization (WHO) standards. The logarithmic average <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> levels and the maximum value <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> level measured for the period <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> (LAFmax) were interpolated using Interpolated Noise Levels for Observer Points in ArcGIS producing noise level maps for crossroads. The logarithmic average <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> levels and LAFmax measurements were respectively above domestic and WHO standards in 96 % and 100 % of outdoor environment and indoor environment locations. Interpolated values of logarithmic average <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> levels and LAFmax for five crossroads were above domestic and WHO standards indicating noise levels in road traffic could remain high. A yearly acoustic measurement for vehicles should be implemented. Participatory <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> levels in quite indoor environments can be used to increase the awareness of inhabitants in Tirana...|$|R
25|$|A-weighted SPL <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> {{level are}} {{increasingly}} found on sales literature for domestic appliances such as refrigerators, freezers and computer fans.

50|$|Psophometric {{weighting}} {{refers to}} any weighting curve {{used in the}} <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise.</b> In the field of audio engineering it has a more specific meaning, referring to noise weightings used especially in measuring noise on telecommunications circuits. Key standards are ITU-T O.41 and C-message weighting as shown here.|$|E
50|$|As a result, {{environmental}} noise is studied, regulated and monitored by many governments and institutions. This creates {{a number of}} different occupations. The basis of all decisions is supported by the objective and accurate <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise.</b> Noise is measured in decibels (dB) using a pattern-approved sound level meter. The measurements are typically taken over a period of weeks, in all weather conditions.|$|E
50|$|Measurements {{based on}} psychoacoustics, {{such as the}} <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise,</b> often use a {{weighting}} filter. It is well established that human hearing is more sensitive to some frequencies than others, as demonstrated by equal-loudness contours, {{but it is not}} well appreciated that these contours vary {{depending on the type of}} sound. The measured curves for pure tones, for instance, are different from those for random noise. The ear also responds less well to short bursts, below 100 to 200 ms, than to continuous sounds such that a quasi-peak detector has been found to give the most representative results when noise contains click or bursts, as is often the case for noise in digital systems. For these reasons, a set of subjectively valid measurement techniques have been devised and incorporated into BS, IEC, EBU and ITU standards. These methods of audio quality measurement are used by broadcast engineers throughout most of the world, as well as by some audio professionals, though the older A-weighting standard for continuous tones is still commonly used by others.|$|E
5000|$|Dependent on {{spectral}} content, 468-weighted <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> {{are generally}} about 11 dB higher than A-weighted, {{and this is}} probably {{a factor in the}} recent trend away from 468-weighting in equipment specifications as cassette tape use declines.|$|R
