5|$|Roslin was <b>more</b> <b>severely</b> {{damaged by}} the Earl of Hertford, who burned the castle during the War of the Rough Wooing in 1544. The keep was almost totally destroyed, {{although}} its one remaining ruined wall can still be seen.|$|E
5|$|Hunt drew {{criticism}} for {{his style of}} returning the football; upon receiving the ball, he would run straight at opposition players rather than attempting to evade them. As a result, he received several high tackles, causing the Broncos to ask the NRL to protect Hunt by punishing opposition players <b>more</b> <b>severely.</b> The referees' board supported this position, and stated that fullbacks such as Hunt needed to be protected due to greater risk of injury.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the 271 people on board the aircraft, two employees at a nearby repair garage were killed and two <b>more</b> <b>severely</b> burned. At 273 victims, this was the deadliest accident in US aviation history. The crash scene is a field northwest of the intersection of Touhy Avenue (Illinois Route 72) and Mount Prospect Road {{on the border of}} the suburbs of Des Plaines and Mount Prospect, Illinois.|$|E

50|$|In {{the film}} Solid State Society, Saito was missing {{through most of}} the movie because he was in Africa and later because his left arm was shot by another sniper; naturally, his shot was <b>more</b> accurate, <b>severely</b> {{wounding}} his target.|$|R
50|$|In the {{surrounding}} towns, 15 houses collapsed, 66 {{had to be}} demolished later, 243 needed restoration and 669 had to be repaired. About 260 houses went unscathed. Four churches were destroyed, and 21 <b>more</b> were <b>severely</b> damaged. The city of Venice sustained minor damage, assessed as 6th degree on the Mercalli scale.|$|R
5|$|After {{arriving}} off Trondheim, Admiral Hipper successfully passed {{herself off}} as a British warship long enough to steam past the Norwegian coastal artillery batteries. The ship entered the harbor and docked shortly before 05:30 to debark the mountain troops. After the ground troops seized control of the coastal batteries, the ship left Trondheim, bound for Germany. She was escorted by Friedrich Eckoldt; she reached Wilhelmshaven on 12 April, and went into drydock. The dockyard workers discovered the ship had been damaged <b>more</b> <b>severely</b> by the collision with Glowworm than had previously been thought. Nevertheless, repairs were completed {{in the span of}} two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Near the {{beginning}} of August 1915, Sing was hospitalised for four days with influenza. That same month, an enemy sniper's bullet struck Sheehan's spotting telescope, injuring his hands and face, and then hit Sing's shoulder, but the latter was back in action after a week's recuperation. Sheehan was <b>more</b> <b>severely</b> wounded, and was shipped back to Australia. This was reportedly {{the only time that}} Sing was injured at Gallipoli. He would not fare so well later on in the war.|$|E
5|$|The Army was {{ultimately}} under political authority. Since the Glorious Revolution of 1688 the Crown {{has not been}} permitted a standing army in the United Kingdom – it derives its existence from the Army Act, passed by Parliament each year (every five years since the late 1950s). The House of Commons took these responsibilities seriously: a letter from Haig clarifying the position on shell-shock had to be read out in the House of Commons on 14 March 1918. Most disciplinary regulations in the First World War derived from the 1881 Army Act, although some offences were <b>more</b> <b>severely</b> dealt with on active service, e.g. in principle looting or wilful disobedience carried the death penalty.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of an overdose such as sleepiness, agitation and ataxia occur much <b>more</b> frequently and <b>severely</b> in children. Hypotonia may also occur in severe cases.|$|R

50|$|Closely related is Pseudopanax ferox, the toothed lancewood. It {{is similar}} to P. crassifolius except the leaves are <b>more</b> {{abundant}} and <b>severely</b> toothed, resembling a bandsaw blade.|$|R
5|$|For an {{hour the}} frigates {{exchanged}} broadsides, until 01:15 when Hamelin, who had realised {{that he was}} fighting a warship not a troopship or East Indiaman, dropped back to effect repairs after suffering damage to his rigging. Ceylon was <b>more</b> <b>severely</b> damaged than the French ship and when Hamelin returned at 02:15, her repairs were not complete, preventing her escape. The battle began again, both frigates suffering serious damage in the second encounter. By 03:00, Vénus had lost her mizzenmast and two topmasts, while Ceylon had lost all of her topmasts, which had destroyed much of the ship's rigging as they fell. With both ships now unable to manoeuvre, the action continued at close range until 04:00, when Vénus was able to haul herself away to await the arrival of Victor.|$|E
5|$|Révolutionnaire had {{suffered}} much <b>more</b> <b>severely</b> than Audacious, but survived the encounter without being boarded {{thanks to a}} misread signal by Captain Albemarle Bertie of Thunderer, who failed to take possession of the dismasted three-decker when ordered to. During the night Villaret sent reinforcements to rescue Révolutionnaire, and at dawn on 29 May Parker saw that his large opponent was soon to be supported by the undamaged ship of the line Audacieux, the frigate Bellone, and two corvettes. Once more Audacious came under fire from Révolutionnaire, leaving her {{no option but to}} flee this superior force. Audacious was chased for half an hour by Bellone and the corvettes, before losing them in a rain squall, and eventually returned to Plymouth on 3 June. Révolutionnaire also escaped pursuit and was taken under tow by Audacieux, who brought her safely to Rochefort several days later. For leaving the battlefleet before the main engagement, Révolutionnaires captain was subsequently arrested.|$|E
5|$|During Memphis's 1873 {{yellow fever}} {{epidemic}}, he—along with other Memphis rabbis and leading Jews—remained {{in the city}} rather than fleeing. During the seven weeks the epidemic lasted, 51 people were buried in B'nai Israel's cemetery, almost twice the number typically buried there in a whole year. When another yellow fever epidemic broke out in 1878, Samfield stayed again, ministering to the dead and dying of all faiths. During that epidemic 78 people were buried in the congregation's cemetery. The city's frequent yellow fever epidemics decimated its Jewish community, which dropped from 2,100 to 300. They also hurt B'nai Israel's finances; members did not pay their dues, {{and for a time}} the congregation could not afford to pay Samfield. By 1880, however, membership had increased to 124 families, and finances had improved. By this time, the synagogue was more typically called Children of Israel. Beth El Emeth was affected <b>more</b> <b>severely</b> than Children of Israel by the epidemics; its rabbi (Peres) died of yellow fever in 1879. In 1882, Beth El Emeth disbanded, and transferred its property to Children of Israel, though most Beth El Emeth members joined the Orthodox Baron Hirsch Synagogue. The property included land on Second Street, and Beth El Emeth's cemetery.|$|E

40|$|Health care report cards—public {{disclosure}} of patient health outcomes {{at the level}} of the individual physician or hospital or both—may address important informational asymmetries in markets for health care, but they may also give doctors and hospitals incentives to decline to treat <b>more</b> difficult, <b>severely</b> ill patients. Whether report cards are good for patients and for society depends on whether their financial and health benefits outweigh their costs in terms of the quantity...|$|R
5|$|In 1975 the U.S. DOT {{conservatively}} {{identified a}} 0.7% reduction in traffic fatalities during DST, and estimated the real reduction at 1.5% to 2%, but the 1976 NBS {{review of the}} DOT study found no differences in traffic fatalities. In 1995 the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety estimated a reduction of 1.2%, including a 5% reduction in crashes fatal to pedestrians. Others have found similar reductions. Single/Double Summer Time (SDST), a variant where clocks are one hour ahead of the sun in winter and two in summer, has been projected to reduce traffic fatalities by 3% to 4% in the UK, compared to ordinary DST. However, accidents do increase {{by as much as}} 11% during the two weeks that follow the end of British Summer Time. It is not clear whether sleep disruption contributes to fatal accidents immediately after the spring clock shifts. A correlation between clock shifts and traffic accidents has been observed in North America and the UK but not in Finland or Sweden. If this effect exists, it is far smaller than the overall reduction in traffic fatalities. A 2009 U.S. study found that on Mondays after the switch to DST, workers sleep an average of 40 minutes less, and are injured at work more often and <b>more</b> <b>severely.</b>|$|E
25|$|In limb malformations, {{the upper}} limbs are {{typically}} <b>more</b> <b>severely</b> affected than the lower limbs. There {{have been many}} cases of only upper limb malformation.|$|E
25|$|Ascaris takes {{most of its}} {{nutrients}} from the partially digested host food in the intestine. There {{is some evidence that}} it can secrete anti-enzymes, presumably to protect itself from digestion by the hosts' enzymes. Children are often <b>more</b> <b>severely</b> affected.|$|E

50|$|The {{only major}} {{accident}} that {{occurred on the}} NSC network was the Cowden collision when, on 15 October 1994, the driver of a Class 205 failed to see a red signal (this was {{believed to have been}} caused by fog), and drove the unit on to a single track section of the Uckfield line, where it collided with a train travelling in the opposite direction. Five people, including the erroneous driver were killed, and thirteen <b>more</b> were <b>severely</b> injured.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps my guilty {{conscience}} deceived me, but I {{thought he}} looked at me <b>more</b> sadly and <b>severely</b> than I had ever seen him look before. His voice, too, was troubled when he spoke. This was a change, which meant much in him.|$|R
25|$|Untreated {{cholecystitis}} {{can lead}} to worsened inflammation and infected bile that {{can lead to}} a collection of pus surrounding the gallbladder, also known as empyema. The symptoms of empyema are similar to uncomplicated choleystitis but greater severity: high fever, severe abdominal pain, <b>more</b> <b>severely</b> elevated white blood count.|$|E
25|$|Stem cell transplantation, {{particularly}} in younger (i.e. less than 40 years of age) and <b>more</b> <b>severely</b> affected patients, {{offers the potential}} for curative therapy.

50|$|The German {{losses at}} sea were heavy, with {{the sinking of}} one of the Kriegsmarines two heavy cruisers, two of its six light cruisers, 10 of its 20 destroyers and six U-boats. With several <b>more</b> ships <b>severely</b> damaged, the German surface fleet had only three cruisers and four destroyers {{operational}} {{in the aftermath of the}} Norwegian Campaign. Two torpedo boats and 15 light naval units were also lost during the campaign. Two German battleships and two cruisers were damaged during the campaign.|$|R
50|$|The Panama ROV {{consists}} of a Snatch Land Rover modified for remote control operation, with {{a large piece of}} mine-detection equipment mounted to the front. It was created by Defence Equipment and Support, part of the Ministry of Defence, in conjunction with PA Consulting Group as a low-cost solution to mine detection in the War in Afghanistan. Before the introduction of the Panama, an average of one person every week was killed, with five or six <b>more</b> being <b>severely</b> injured.|$|R
25|$|Just as athletes {{begin to}} {{conserve}} their remaining strength when their muscles begin to tire, so do self-controllers {{when some of}} their self-regulatory resources have been expended. The severity of behavioral impairment during depletion depends in part on whether the person expects further challenges and demands. When people expect to have to exert self-control later, they will curtail current performance <b>more</b> <b>severely</b> than if no such demands are anticipated.|$|E
25|$|In some states, a {{burglary}} committed during {{the hours of}} daylight is technically not burglary, but housebreaking. In many jurisdictions in the U.S., burglary is punished <b>more</b> <b>severely</b> than housebreaking. In California, for example, burglary was punished as burglary in the first degree, while housebreaking was punished as burglary in the second degree. California now distinguishes between entry into a residence and into a commercial building, with the burglary of a residence bearing heavier punishment.|$|E
25|$|On 15 February 2011, a judge indicted Berlusconi {{to stand}} trial on charges {{carrying}} up to 15 years in prison. Paying for sex with a minor in Italy is punished within a range of six months to three years imprisonment, while the crime of malfeasance in office (It: concussione) is <b>more</b> <b>severely</b> punished, from four years to twelve years imprisonment, as it is considered a type of extortion committed by a public officer.|$|E
