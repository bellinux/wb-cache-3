The main leading gear units are mounted on triangulated tubular structures, while the nose gear is bracketed to the cockpit bulkhead via a watertight seal in the planing bottom.

The nose, which is covered by large glazed panels, has a bow chine and planing bottom built as a unit with the flight deck, which is higher than the main cabin floor.|$|R
5|$|The {{airframe}} is of semi-monocoque structure constructed {{primarily of}} aluminium alloys. High strength steel and titanium alloys are partially adopted in some critical areas. The airframe {{is designed for}} a service life of 4,000 flight hours or 25 years, the first overhaul being due at 1,200 flight hours. Block 2 JF-17s incorporate greater use of composite materials in the airframe to reduce weight. The retractable undercarriage has a tricycle arrangement with a single steerable nose-wheel and two <b>main</b> undercarriages. The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brakes</b> have an automatic anti-skid system. The position {{and shape of the}} inlets is designed to give the required airflow to the jet engine during manoeuvres involving high angles of attack.|$|R

40|$|Abstract：The {{full power}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> system has several {{advantages}} over traditional brake actuation systems. These systems {{are capable of}} supplying fluid {{to a range of}} very small and large volume service brakes with actuation that is faster than air/hydraulic brake systems. Implementation of full power <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> system in off-road vehicles calls for good understanding of its dynamic characteristics. In this paper, we consider the problem of dynamic modeling of the brake system and develop a dynamic model for a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> valve. First, the dynamic characteristics of full power <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> system are analyzed theoretically. The effects of varying design parameters (brake valve, accumulator and so on) and the different operating conditions are then analyzed. Second, we investigate the dynamic characteristics of a full power <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> system using a test bench, which is a loader brake system specifically designed for one construction Machinery Company. Finally, based on the experimental results, the mathematical models are amended and verified. The result shows that the model-calculated data agree well with tested data. The dynamic behavior of hydraulic valve can be well predicted with the model. The simplified models {{can be applied to the}} studies of full power <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> system dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The bogie of {{monorail}} vehicles applies {{rubber wheel}} system not steel wheel system. In addition, The {{structure of the}} bogie is very complicated because vehicle operates on the elevated road and vehicle drives with wrapping the guide way. When the monorail vehicle applies air brake system, lower device of vehicle may be complex and some devices may be limited. On the other hand, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> equipment is compact and not weighing. Braking force is also outstanding compared with air <b>brake</b> so the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> equipment is suitable for monorail vehicle.
