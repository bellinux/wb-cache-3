25|$|Evoked {{potential}} amplitudes {{tend to be}} low, {{ranging from}} less than a <b>microvolt</b> to several microvolts, compared to tens of microvolts for EEG, millivolts for EMG, and often close to a volt for ECG. To resolve these low-amplitude potentials {{against the background of}} ongoing EEG, ECG, EMG, and other biological signals and ambient noise, signal averaging is usually required. The signal is time-locked to the stimulus and most of the noise occurs randomly, allowing the noise to be averaged out with averaging of repeated responses.|$|E

2500|$|In 1821, the German {{physicist}} Thomas Johann Seebeck {{discovered that}} when different metals are {{joined at the}} ends {{and there is a}} temperature difference between the joints, a magnetic field is observed. At the time Seebeck referred to this as thermo-magnetism. The magnetic field he observed was later shown to be due to thermo-electric current. In practical use, the voltage generated at a single junction of two different types of wire is what is of interest as this can be used to measure temperature at very high and low temperatures. [...] The magnitude of the voltage depends on the types of wire used. [...] Generally, the voltage is in the <b>microvolt</b> range and care must be taken to obtain a usable measurement. [...] Although very little current flows, power can be generated by a single thermocouple junction. [...] Power generation using multiple thermocouples, as in a thermopile, is common.|$|E
2500|$|Outside of {{documents}} adhering to SI units, {{the practice is}} very common {{as illustrated by the}} following examples. There is no general rule, with various discipline-specific practices. Sometimes the suffix is a unit symbol ("W","K","m"), sometimes it is a transliteration of a unit symbol ("uV" [...] instead of μV for <b>microvolt),</b> sometimes it is an acronym for the unit's name ("sm" [...] for square meter, [...] "m" [...] for milliwatt), other times it is a mnemonic for the type of quantity being calculated ("i" [...] for antenna gain with respect to an isotropic antenna, [...] "λ" [...] for anything normalized by the EM wavelength), or otherwise a general attribute or identifier {{about the nature of the}} quantity ("A" [...] for A-weighted sound pressure level). The suffix is often connected with a dash (dB-Hz), with a space (dB HL), with no intervening character (dBm), or enclosed in parentheses, dB(sm).|$|E

50|$|Research {{conducted}} in the early 1980s by Dr. Richard Cohen {{and his colleagues at}} MIT explored the idea that visually indiscernible alternans may be equally significant. These efforts established a link between visually imperceptible alternans at the <b>microvolt</b> level and susceptibility to arrhythmias and showed alternans to be a heart rate dependent phenomenon. In addition, Dr. Joseph Smith, working with Dr. Cohen developed a methodology known as the Spectral Method which allowed measurement of alternans at the level of one <b>microvolt.</b>|$|E
50|$|The femtowatt (fW) {{is equal}} to one quadrillionth (10−15) of a watt. Technologically {{important}} powers that are measured in femtowatts are typically found in reference(s) to radio and radar receivers. For example, meaningful FM tuner performance figures for sensitivity, quieting and signal-to-noise require that the RF energy applied to the antenna input be specified. These input levels are often stated in dBf (decibels referenced to 1 femtowatt). This is 0.2739 <b>microvolt</b> across a 75-ohm load or 0.5477 <b>microvolt</b> across a 300-ohm load; the specification {{takes into account the}} RF input impedance of the tuner.|$|E

50|$|Signal {{reception}} is invariably done via a superheterodyne receiver: {{the first}} stage is a tuner which selects a television channel and frequency-shifts it to a fixed intermediate frequency (IF). The signal amplifier performs amplification to the IF stages from the <b>microvolt</b> range to fractions of a volt.|$|E

50|$|Sensory NCS are {{performed}} by electrical stimulation of a peripheral nerve and recording from a purely sensory {{portion of the}} nerve, such as on a finger. Like the motor studies, sensory latencies are {{on the scale of}} milliseconds. Sensory amplitudes are much smaller than the motor amplitudes, usually in the <b>microvolt</b> (μV) range. The sensory NCV is calculated based upon the latency and the distance between the stimulating and recording electrodes.|$|E
50|$|In human neuroanatomy, {{brainstem}} {{auditory evoked potentials}} (BAEPs), {{also called}} brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAERs), are very small auditory evoked potentials {{in response to an}} auditory stimulus, which are recorded by electrodes placed on the scalp. They reflect neuronal activity in the auditory nerve, cochlear nucleus, superior olive, and inferior colliculus of the brainstem. They typically have a response latency of no more than six milliseconds with an amplitude of approximately one <b>microvolt.</b>|$|E

Due to artifact, eight participants were excluded from this analysis, leaving n of 37. As expected, N 2 amplitudes were significantly greater (more negative) in response to “NoGo” stimuli (M[*]=[*]−[*] 7.136 <b>microvolts,</b> SD[*]=[*] 4.0364) than in response to “Go” stimuli (M[*]=[*]−[*] 6.118 <b>microvolts,</b> SD[*]=[*] 3.379), t(36)[*]=[*] 1.886, p[*]=[*] 0.0335, 90 % CI [. 106, 1.929].
