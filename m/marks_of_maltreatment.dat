40|$|Perception <b>of</b> child <b>maltreatment</b> {{remains an}} area <b>of</b> child <b>maltreatment</b> {{infrequently}} examined despite its relevance to understanding risks <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> <b>of</b> vulnerable children. Apart from {{its relationship to}} childhood maltreatment (Goldsmith, Freyd, & DePrince, 2009), perception is of par-ticular interest to understanding <b>maltreatment</b> because <b>of</b> its relevance to perpetration or propensity to perpetrate mal-treatment (Madu, Idemudia, & Jegede, 2002; Varia, Abidin, & Dass, 1996). Yet, knowledge about perception of maltreat-ment is sparse. Although many factors {{may be attributed to}} this sparse knowledge, including variability in legal and con-ceptual definitions <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> across regions, prolifera-tion of terms related to maltreatment, and inconsistent examination of abusive behaviors across studies (Baker, 2009; Riddle & Aponte, 1999), the majority of existing mea-sures focus primarily on direct accounts <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> or retrospective accounts <b>of</b> childhood <b>maltreatment</b> and few on direct measurement <b>of</b> perception <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment.</b> Although several measures are used to operationalize cur-rent or retrospective experience <b>of</b> child <b>maltreatment,</b> those that measure perception <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> are sparse and pri-marily framed from perspectives of respondents in devel...|$|R

This study did not find support for type-specific patterns and the moderating role of continuity of unemployment. The findings of this study support the hypothesis for the intergenerational transmission <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment.</b> However, no support was found for the social learning theory or the family stress model.

40|$|There are few {{research}} {{reports of the}} experience of multiple forms of child abuse and neglect (multi-type maltreatment). A critical review is presented of 29 studies in which adult retrospective reports of more than one form <b>of</b> child <b>maltreatment</b> (sexual abuse, physical abuse, psychological maltreatment, neglect, or witnessing family violence) are assessed. Empirical investigations of the extent and impact <b>of</b> multi-type <b>maltreatment</b> are identified. Data on the relationship between the different forms <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> and the adjustment problems associated with each type <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> are critiqued. As well as using dichotomous measures <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment,</b> an important methodological problem was the failure of researchers to assess all child maltreatment types, the relationship between multi-type maltreatment and adjustment, and the role of variables influencing the occurrence or impact <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment.</b> Considerable overlap was found in the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> types. The compounding or interacting effects <b>of</b> experiencing multi-type <b>maltreatment</b> were ignored in many studies. Where an assessment was made of the specific impact <b>of</b> multi-type <b>maltreatment,</b> it was associated with greater impairment than single forms of abuse or neglect.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that child maltreatment can negatively impact brain development and neurocognitive systems for children, adolescents, and adults. However there are no published studies that have sought to understand the role <b>of</b> child <b>maltreatment</b> with psychiatrically hospitalized children. Psychiatrically hospitalized children are considered a high-risk population due to increased suicidality, internalizing disorders, and lower cognitive functioning. The current study examined a hierarchical and cumulative model <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> with inpatient children (ages 6 - 14 years old) who had been maltreated (n= 111) to understand its impact on executive functioning skills, compared with a psychiatric outpatient sample (n= 166). Results using a hierarchical and cumulative model <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> revealed that significant differences existed between the outpatient sample and children who had been maltreated on combined measures of general executive functioning, even after controlling for FSIQ. Group differences between the outpatient and inpatient samples were found for those who had been sexually and physically abused, but not neglected on general executive functioning skills using a hierarchical model <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment.</b> The cumulative model revealed significant differences between the control group and those who had been exposed to three and four types <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment.</b> Distinct neuropsychological profiles were related to the type <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> and the number <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> types the child had been exposed.

40|$|This study {{provides}} a unique {{insight into the}} impact and experience <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> in elite adult sport, which to date has had limited consideration within the sporting literature. The evidence suggests that elite adult athletes can experience maltreatment in high performance environments and such treatment {{has the potential to}} have long-term negative effects on athlete wellbeing and continued participation in sport. However, to date, much of the guidance on protecting and supporting athletes has been directed toward child athletes or those under the age of 18. There remains much to be understood about the experience <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> into adulthood if adult safeguarding and protection in sport are to be enhanced. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore elite adult athletes’ experiences <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> in high performance sport. In order to meet the aim of this research, athlete narratives <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> gained through in-depth interviews were completed in order to capture the experiences of both male and female elite athletes. The participants of this study were 12 elite athletes between the ages of 19 and 35 years (mean = 27 years), who had competed in the United Kingdom and had represented England, Wales and/or Great Britain within their chosen sport. A variety of sports and sports types were included within the sample with participants from eleven different sports (hockey, volleyball, archery, rugby, cricket, football, eventing, handball, beach volleyball, taekwondo and tennis), and both team and individual sports were represented. Five main themes were identified: becoming an athlete, being an athlete, being maltreated, the perceived impact <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> and coping with maltreatment. The findings suggest that maltreatment in sport is complex and multifaceted, and has the potential to pose a significant threat to athlete wellbeing. Prior to this study, existing research had failed to explore maltreatment as an overarching phenomenon and instead sought to examine individual types <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment.</b> While this has increased understanding, the complexity of experience is lost when individual maltreatment types are explored in isolation. This study underlines the co-occurring nature <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> as well as the diverse nature of the experience <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment.</b> In addition, taking a broader approach has enabled an understanding <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> types that have not previously been systematically explored. This study therefore extends knowledge about and understanding of the experience <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> in high performance environments. A conceptual framework is presented to demonstrate how athletes experience maltreatment in sport. This study supports the need to further explore the impact on and consequences <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> for athletic experience. Implications for practice and future research directions are outlined in order to identify the scope of work yet to be explored in this area. This study makes an important contribution to knowledge as the first piece of research that seeks to illuminate the experience <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> in high performance sport...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: This {{study had}} two primary objectives: First, {{to examine the}} nature and co-occurrence of various forms <b>of</b> child <b>maltreatment</b> (sexual, physical. emotional, and {{witnessing}} violence) reported by Latina college students, and second, to explore coexisting maltreatment types and acculturation status as possible contributors to long-term adjustment difficulties. Method: Participants were 112 Latina undergraduate students categorized by the number <b>of</b> childhood <b>maltreatment</b> types experienced (0, 1, or 2 or more) and acculturation level (1 to 5). The possible effects of co-occurring forms <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment,</b> in conjunction with acculturation status, were investigated with respect to participants’ reported trauma symptomatology. Data were collected using self-report measures. Results: Nearly three out of 10 participants (29 %) experienced more than one type <b>of</b> child <b>maltreatment</b> and, as expected, these individuals reported greater trauma symptomatology than those reporting either a single type <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> or no maltreatment at all. Those who reported multiple types also endured more severe maltreatment than did respondents who experienced a single type. Acculturation level was neither directly related to trauma symptoms nor did it moderate the lasting correlates <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> among victims. Interestingly, those who experienced a single form <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> reported no more trauma symptoms than did participants who reported no maltreatment history at all. Conclusion: This investigation documents a large degree of overlap among various forms <b>of</b> self-reported childhood <b>maltreatment</b> within a Latina college population. The results underscore the need to consider multiple forms <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment,</b> as well as severity, when making inferences regarding potential effects on later functioning...|$|R

Although maltreatment in European countries is well documented, knowledge concerning this phenomenon remains sparse in Greece. This study examined mothers’ and teacher’s evaluation of severity of four types of maltreatment: physical abuse, physical neglect, emotional abuse and emotional neglect. It was also examined whether mothers and teachers differ in their evaluation <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> and if their perceptions are influenced by demographics and previous maltreatment experience. 41 Greek mothers of children 2 to 6 years old, 20 Greek teachers and 2 professionals working in Youth Care centers in Greece distributed Maltreatment Q-sort (MQS) and filled in Children Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and Background information Questionnaire. Within subjects contrast showed that mothers evaluated significantly more harmful physical abuse than the other types <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> and physical neglect than emotional neglect and emotional abuse. Teachers also showed significant differences on subscales of MQS apart from physical neglect and emotional abuse. Mothers and teachers did not strongly differ in how they evaluated maltreatment and mothers showed higher convergence with the professionals’ view <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment.</b> Identity, number <b>of</b> children and <b>maltreatment</b> experiences are related to participants’ perception <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment.</b> Understanding perception <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> is vital, as its perception has implications for reporting maltreatment and identifying intervention needs of vulnerable children.

This dissertation examines the usefulness of the Continuous Quality Assessment tool (CQA) and its effectiveness in assessing risk. The CQA is an assessment tool that is designed to guide child protective workers in making case decisions throughout the life of the case. This dissertation on risk assessment and recurrence <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> adds to the measurable outcomes of effectiveness for child protection services and enhances a public child welfare agency 2 ̆ 7 s ability to improve service delivery to families. A modified one-group pretest posttest design was utilized to assess the dependent variables, risk <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> and recurrence <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment,</b> before and after casework services were provided. Changes in risk <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> were measured by the cumulative rating on the assessment tool, as well as by scores in the specific risk domains: <b>maltreatment,</b> sequence <b>of</b> events (how well the family is managing their high-risk situations), family development stages, family choice of discipline, adult patterns of behavior, child/youth development, and family support. The second dependent variable, recurrence <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment,</b> was measured by the number <b>of</b> reports <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> investigated in the year following case closure.

Methods: Participants included 131 youths who had been confirmed as victims <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> prior to age 13 by Child Protective Services. Findings: Emotional and physical neglect were the most prevalent experiences found in the official records: 80 % and 86 % respectively. However, when were assessed through self-report, only 51 % of participants reported emotional neglect and 36 % reported physical neglect. Only a small number of self-reports were consistent with official records (17 %).

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the nature, extent {{and impact of}} multiple forms <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> (multi-type maltreatment) from within a developmental victimological framework. The interrelationships between sexual abuse, physical abuse, psychological maltreatment, neglect, and witnessing family violence are assessed. The role of family variables in predicting maltreatment and the relative contribution <b>of</b> child <b>maltreatment</b> and family variables to adjustment are evaluated. Risk factors for multi-type maltreatment, {{and the relationship between}} multi-type maltreatment and adjustment are explored. The major theories of child development are reviewed. As well as exploring the relevance of developmental theories to understanding the impact <b>of</b> child <b>maltreatment,</b> factors influencing the emergence of child psychopathology are reviewed from a developmental psychopathology perspective. Ecological and developmental perspectives on how child maltreatment translates into the behavioural and emotional adjustment problems of children are integrated in the Child Maltreatment: Risk and Protection Model. After exploring some of the relevant conceptual issues, the literature on the prevalence and impact <b>of</b> each <b>maltreatment</b> type is reviewed, and the literature on multi-type maltreatment critiqued. Methodological and ethical concerns with the conduct of research in the field <b>of</b> child <b>maltreatment</b> using direct assessment of children led to the need for an instrument to assess parent perceptions of each of the types of abuse and neglect, as well as adult retrospective reports. Data are presented from two cross-sectional questionnaire-based studies using the Parent and Adult versions of the Family and Life Experiences Questionnaire which was designed to assess perceptions of children 2 ̆ 7 s experiences of sexual abuse, physical abuse, psychological maltreatment, neglect and witnessing family violence. Problems with the isolated focus of research on single forms <b>of</b> child <b>maltreatment</b> are addressed by the inclusion of each of these forms <b>of</b> child <b>maltreatment</b> within a single research design. Respondents for both studies were volunteers recruited from counselling agencies, medical, community health, child care and fitness centres and a first year psychology course. Parents (N= 50) described their perceptions of primary school children 2 ̆ 7 s family characteristics, experiences <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> and adjustment. Children 2 ̆ 7 s behavioural adjustment (internalising and externalising), sexual behaviours, emotions, self-esteem, gender identity, family adaptability and cohesion, parental traditionality, parental sexual punitiveness, interparental relationship satisfaction, and demographic characteristics are assessed in the study of Parents 2 ̆ 7 perceptions. A large degree of overlap between the different types of abuse and neglect was found, with a high proportion of parents describing children 2 ̆ 7 s experiences of multiple forms <b>of</b> child <b>maltreatment.</b> Using both maltreatment and family characteristics to predict internalising behaviour problems, neglect and family cohesion were the only unique predictors. Family adaptability and cohesion were the only unique predictors of externalising behaviour problems. Physical and sexual abuse were not predicted from family characteristics; neglect was predicted, but no variables provided unique prediction. Unique predictors <b>of</b> psychological <b>maltreatment</b> were family cohesion, parental sexual punitiveness and divorce. Divorce was the only variable with significant unique prediction of the child witnessing family violence. Family background and family functioning were found to predict some forms <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment,</b> but to also be important factors mediating the adjustment of children, independent <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment.</b> The results are interpreted within an ecological framework, integrating risk factors for <b>maltreatment</b> with experiences <b>of</b> abuse and neglect and subsequent adjustment in childhood. Retrospective reports of adults 2 ̆ 7 (N= 175) own childhood family characteristics, experiences <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment,</b> and reports <b>of</b> their current adjustment are also studied. Included with the adult version of the FLEQ were the Trauma Symptom Checklist- 40, Rosenberg 2 ̆ 7 s Self-esteem Scale, and the Family and Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale-II. Similar results were found in the in the Adult Study. As hypothesised, adult retrospective reports of the five different types <b>of</b> child <b>maltreatment</b> were found to be highly intercorrelated. Family characteristics predicted maltreatment and adjustment scores and discriminated between single and multi-type maltreatment. Maltreatment scores also predicted adult adjustment. As the number <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> types increased, there was {{an increase in the number}} of adjustment problems reported. Alternate hypotheses regarding the possible operation of mediating and moderating processes in the relationships between family characteristics, maltreatment and the adjustment of adults were assessed. Finally, the results of these investigations are discussed and interpreted in the light of extant findings previously reviewed. Data from the two major empirical studies are used to demonstrate the overlap between different child maltreatment categories, and the extent and impact <b>of</b> multi-type <b>maltreatment.</b> The results show that children are vulnerable to more than one type <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment.</b> Individuals who experience a number of different forms <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> had greater adjustment problems than those experiencing only one or two different types of abuse or neglect. Dysfunctional families place children at risk <b>of</b> child <b>maltreatment.</b> Negative family characteristics lead to adjustment problems in children and adults. The type <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> having the most damaging effect on children was neglect, and in the long-term, sexual abuse. A multi-dimensional approach to prevention and intervention needs to be adopted, based on the co-morbidity <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> types, and the likelihood of children experiencing further abuse or neglect of a different type. Dysfunctional family dynamics which place children at risk <b>of</b> multi-type <b>maltreatment,</b> and mediate the effects <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> on adjustment, need to be specifically targeted with support and family intervention strategies. Risk-assessment measures used by Child Protection workers must include adequate knowledge of the inter-relationships between maltreatment types, and the particularly negative impact on adjustment of experiencing many forms of abuse or neglect. Suggestions for future clinical and research work in the area <b>of</b> child <b>maltreatment</b> are developed. The importance of assessing all forms <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> when examining the relationships <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> to adjustment is emphasised. It is recommended that prevention and intervention strategies acknowledge the interrelationships between maltreatment types...|$|R
40|$|Current maltreatment {{research}} speculates neglect is {{more prevalent}} than abuse, {{is associated with}} other forms <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> in 95 % of cases, and can go unnoticed until other forms <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> are {{brought to the attention}} of authorities (Arthur, 2007). Even though any form <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> is detrimental to the development of a young person; neglect has been significantly associated with youth delinquency and insecure attachment (Robertson, 2009; Zielinski, 2009). Neglect however, is the most understudied and least understood form <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> (McSherry, 2007). This study aimed to explore neglect and its relationship with insecure attachment and youth delinquency. Eighty one young males, aged 16 – 20 years were recruited from community organisations and a school located in the lower North Island of New Zealand. The young people were assigned into two groups - delinquent group and non-delinquent group. Three questionnaires were administered: Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Adolescent Attachment Questionnaire, and Self-Report Delinquency Scale. Results indicated that overall maltreatment, overall abuse, overall neglect, physical abuse, and physical neglect were all significantly associated with youth delinquency. The more severe the experience of physical abuse or physical neglect the more likely the young person was to display delinquent behaviour. There was no association found between attachment and delinquent behaviour, possible reasons for this are discussed. Physical neglect was the only type <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> to remain significant after the school group was removed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] This study {{examined}} relationships among maltreatment experience, therapeutic alliance formation, and treatment outcome {{in a sample}} of 38 psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents. It was hypothesized that the experience <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> would interfere with alliance formation, thereby compromising the effectiveness of therapy. Results indicated that <b>maltreatment,</b> multiplicity <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment,</b> and type <b>of</b> perpetrator <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> were all associated with initial alliance difficulties. None of these variables predicted change in the alliance over time; instead, severity of interpersonal problems was the best predictor <b>of</b> alliance development. <b>Maltreatment</b> s atus was not directly related to treatment outcome; however, maltreated adolescents who failed to develop positive alliances with their therapists tended to show the poorest outcomes. Given the strong relationship between alliance formation and outcome, clinical recommendations for therapists who treat maltreated adolescents are presented.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} role of parental {{personality}} in the perpetration <b>of</b> child <b>maltreatment.</b> Findings from a systematic review of relevant literature highlight a particular dearth of recent research on the topic. Little consensus {{on the relationship between}} personality traits and the perpetration <b>of</b> child <b>maltreatment</b> as a discrete entity, or for specific maltreatment types, is shown. As such, the need for further research into {{the role of}} personality in child maltreatment is warranted. A critique of the Millon Clinical Mutiaxial Inventory, Third Edition (MCMI-III) presents an examination of {{the reliability and validity of}} the tool, and limitations are discussed. Finally, a study to investigate the role of personality in the perpetration <b>of</b> child <b>maltreatment</b> is reported, utilising a ‘risk-referred’ sample of parents involved in care proceedings (n = 90). Significant findings are presented, including the difference between the profiles and response styles of male and female perpetrators and the difference between perpetrators of multiple forms <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> and single forms <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment.</b> Female perpetrators tend to show self-defeating characteristics with a higher level of Debasement whereas males tended to present a profile consistent with socially desirable responding. Perpetrators of multiple forms <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> showed significantly greater levels of pathology. Findings are also made with regard to the impact of childhood adversity upon adult personality and the subsequent link to the perpetration <b>of</b> child <b>maltreatment.</b> The findings are discussed in relation to previous research outcomes and also with regard to implications upon treatment and risk-assessment of perpetrators <b>of</b> child <b>maltreatment.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine {{trends in}} reports <b>of</b> child <b>maltreatment</b> to the Northern Territory Department of Children and Families among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. DESIGN, SETTING AND SUBJECTS: A {{historical}} cohort study using administrative data collections of notifications and substantiated cases <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> among children aged from 0 to 17 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUReS: Annual rates of notification and substantiation {{of different types}} <b>of</b> child <b>maltreatment.</b> RESULTS: From 1999 to 2010, the overall annual rates <b>of</b> notification for <b>maltreatment</b> <b>of</b> Aboriginal children showed an average increase of 21 % (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1. 21; 95 % CI, 1. 19 – 1. 24). The greatest increases were in notifications for neglect and emotional abuse. There were parallel increases in rates of substantiated cases <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment.</b> Among non-Aboriginal children, the overall annual rates of notification also increased (IRR, 1. 10; 95 % CI, 1. 07 – 1. 14); however, changes in annual rates of substantiated cases for all types <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: There have been considerable increases in both notifications and substantiated cases <b>of</b> child <b>maltreatment,</b> most prominently among Aboriginal children. It {{is possible that the}} observed increases reflect increasing incidence of maltreatment; however, they are also consistent with a mix of increased surveillance, improved service access, changes in policy and a shift in public attitudes.

We collected data from a national proportionately stratified random sample of 6233 fourth-grade students in Taiwan in 2014. We conducted bivariate correlations and sets of multiple regression analyses to examine the associations between multiple types <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> (5 types in total) and Internet addiction, and to identify the mediating role of PTSD. The results reveal that being male and experiencing abuse (psychological neglect, physical neglect, paternal physical violence, sexual violence) were associated with increased risk among children of developing PTSD and Internet addiction. Moreover, PTSD mediated the associations between multiple types <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> (except maternal physical violence) and Internet addiction. This study demonstrates (1) the effects of multiple types <b>of</b> <b>maltreatment</b> on the PTSD and Internet addiction of children and (2) the importance of early prevention and intervention in addressing related public-health concerns...|$|R
