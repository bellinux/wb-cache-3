50|$|The {{economic}} region of Lahti, {{which includes the}} surrounding municipalities, was strongly affected {{by the collapse of}} Finnish-Soviet trade and by the recession in the early 1990s. The value of production slumped, especially in the <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>industry</b> and other manufacturing industries (e.g. the furniture industry). Production also decreased in the textile and clothing industry. In 1990, there were 90,370 jobs in the Lahti region.

40|$|Highly {{customized}} products dominate in the <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>industry.</b> Products like machine tools, {{food processing}} or packaging machines {{are characterized by}} a high complexity, a low quantity and a long-term machine life.

40|$|In {{terms of}} the {{intensity}} of Research and Development (R&D), the German <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>industry</b> might at first sight {{not seem to be}} 'cutting-edge technology'; however, it distinguishes itself successfully as a technology, innovation and quality leader in international competition. Along with a strong customer orientation and a high complexity of products, this requires the use of supporting organisational concepts of product development to exploit the available resources for innovation effectively and efficiently. For this purpose, the concept of 'lean production' provides two organisational concepts of product development, i. e., simultaneous engineering and participation in R&D cooperation with external partners. Both concepts are deployed at an above-average level in the German <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>industry.</b> An impact analysis documents the positive effects of these concepts on the product innovation success of the enterprises studied. However, the strength of these effects partially depends on the level of the firms' R&D expenditures. Therefore, the use of such concepts of product development should be well balanced with the individual innovation strategy of the company...|$|E

Whist it was found that the determinants of skill shortage varied somewhat depending upon the definitional approach adopted, a high degree of correlation was found. With regards to the impacts of skill shortages on firm level performance, it was found that both hard-to-fill and unfilled vacancies had reduced output per worker levels by between 65 and 75 % in affected firms, however, these impacts were only detecw after controlling for selection effects. The evidence suggests that standard OLS procedures can generate highly misleading results in studies of this nature. ...|$|R
