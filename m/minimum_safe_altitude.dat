25|$|In September 2011, {{the report}} into the crash was {{published}} by the Interstate Aviation Committee. According to the committee, {{the primary cause of}} the incident was the crew conducting the approach in worse than the minimum meteorological conditions for the airfield, aircraft, and aircraft commander. The failure of the crew to go-around and their descent below the <b>minimum</b> <b>safe</b> <b>altitude</b> in the absence of visual contact with the approach lights or ground references resulted in the collision with trees and controlled flight into terrain.|$|E
25|$|The {{final report}} into the {{accident}} was released in October 2010, concluding {{that the cause of}} the crash was attempting the landing approach in conditions worse than the meteorological minima of the airfield, the aircraft, and the commander. The crew failed to make a timely decision to go-around. They descended below the established <b>minimum</b> <b>safe</b> <b>altitude</b> in the absence of reliable visual contact with runway or approach lights, which led to a collision of the aircraft with trees and terrain. The MAK commented that had the recommendations following the crash of UTair Flight 471 been implemented, the accident may have been prevented. A total of 19 safety recommendations were made.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} a new danger-aware Operational Flight Program (OFP) for the unmanned helicopter&# 039;s auto-navigation based on the well-known time-triggered message-triggered object (TMO) model. Design/methodology/approach - In this design with the TMO, the danger-awareness means two things. First, an unmanned helicopter maneuvers on <b>safe</b> <b>altitudes</b> to avoid buildings or mountains when navigating to the target position. It is assumed that <b>minimum</b> <b>safe</b> <b>altitudes</b> are given on evenly spaced grids and on the center points of every four adjacent grids. A three-dimensional (3 D) path-finding algorithm using this safe-altitude information is proposed. Second, a helicopter automatically avoids a zone with very high temperature caused by a fire. Findings - Since the auto-flight control system requires componentized real-time processing of sensors and controllers, the TMO model that has periodic and sporadic threads as members, has been used in designing the OFP. It has been found that using the TMO scheme is a way to construct a very flexible, well-componentized and timeliness-guaranteed OFP. Practical implications - As the RTOS, RT-eCos has been used. It was developed a few years ago based on the eCos 3. 0 to support the real-time thread model of the TMO scheme. To verify this navigation system, a hardware-in-the-loop simulation (HILS) system also has been developed. Originality/value - Designing an OFP by using the real-time object model TMO and the proposed 3 D safe path finding algorithm is a whole new effective deadline-based approach. And the developed OFP can be used intensively in the phase of disaster response and recovery...|$|R
2500|$|Having {{received}} {{the information about}} the aircraft's location, air traffic control (ATC) gave an erroneous instruction to turn.

2500|$|The {{official}} (Spanish) investigation {{concluded that}} the cause of the accident was that the pilot in command, without taking account of the altitude at which he was flying, took the aircraft into an area of high terrain and thereby failed to maintain a safe height above the terrain. A British addendum to the report found that tardy and ambiguous directions from air traffic control regarding the unpublished hold directly contributed to the disorientation of the aircraft commander. The addendum also found that the unpublished track onto which the aircraft was directed required tight turns to be flown. These were practically unflyable, making entry into the region of high ground inevitable for an aircraft flying this track, even without the navigational errors made by Dan-Air 1008. Further, the addendum found that the directed altitude of [...] was inadequate for this holding pattern, and that the minimum altitude for entry into the holding pattern should have been [...] (with a minimum altitude of [...] for the pattern itself), had a <b>minimum</b> <b>safe</b> <b>altitude</b> calculation been performed ahead of time by a competent authority.

[...] The flight was 100 miles from Shemya 43 minutes later. [...] At 01:45 the flight made radar contact with the airport, at an altitude of 5,500 feet and 18 miles north-northeast of the destination. [...] The air traffic controller reported that the flight entered the glidepath and stayed on the correct approach for runway 10, but two miles from touchdown the flight was 10–15 feet below the ideal glidepath, so he instructed the crew to [...] ""ease the aircraft up"; but the crew failed to correct the position. [...] One mile from touchdown the aircraft was 30–40 feet below the glidepath, to which the controller again instructed the flight crew to [...] "bring the aircraft up." [...] Despite the warnings the flight still maintained the current path with no corrections to the altitude. [...] The flight was still above the <b>minimum</b> <b>safe</b> <b>altitude,</b> and when the flight began to descend rapidly the controller assumed that the pilots switched to a visual approach.

5000|$|The B-47As were {{fitted with}} {{ejection}} seats.

2500|$|When the {{aircraft}} was 6.5nm {{north of the}} Machrihanish (MAC) VOR (a type of radio navigational beacon near Campbeltown Airport), the pilot requested descent clearance.

When the aircraft was 4nm from the MAC VOR, it descended below the SSA to 3,000 feet. This was the altitude needed to enter the airport's landing pattern, but the descent wasn't required until the aircraft was over the MAC VOR. This early descent below the SSA was described by investigators from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) as [...] "contrary to safe practise {{as well as the}} operator's procedures".|$|R

40|$|Guidance schemes are {{designed}} to approximate the optimal survival and optimal performance paths through downbursts, which were determined in the previous paper. Specifically, climb-rate command following is used to achieve performance, and altitude command following is used to enhance survivability. Nonlinear simulations are conducted to investigate {{the effects of the}} climb-rate command and altitude command. Takeoff flight is considered and full thrust is assumed. In a mild to moderate downburst, an aircraft can follow a constant, smaller-than-nominal climb rate without stall. Better survival capability is achieved by climbing at a lower rate accompanied by lower altitude, and vice versa. In a severe downbursts, the aircraft must descend to avoid stall. The farther it descends, the higher the survival capability, but the poorer the performance. If the downburst is very severe, the best strategy is to descend immediately to the lowest <b>safe</b> <b>altitude.</b> Since the intensity of a downbursts is hard to evaluate prior to penetration, it is advisable to keep a high airspeed. Therefore, use of the survival strategy is recommended that employs maximum thrust and allows the aircraft to descend to a <b>safe</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>altitude</b> immediately upon entering a downburst on takeoff...|$|R
40|$|With growing {{interest}} in solar sailing comes the requirement to {{provide a basis for}} future detailed planetary escape mission analysis by drawing together prior work, clarifying and explaining previously anomalies. Previously unexplained seasonal variations in sail escape times from Earth orbit are explained analytically and corroborated within a numerical trajectory model. Blended-sail control algorithms, explicitly independent of time, which provide near-optimal escape trajectories and maintain a <b>safe</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>altitude</b> and which are suitable as a potential autonomous onboard controller, are then presented. These algorithms are investigated from a range of initial conditions and are shown to maintain the optimality previously demonstrated by the use of a single-energy gain control law but without the risk of planetary collision. Finally, it is shown that the minimum sail characteristic acceleration required for escape from a polar orbit without traversing the Earth shadow cone increases exponentially as initial altitude is decreased...|$|R
50|$|Descents {{are part}} of normal procedures, but also occur during emergencies, such as rapid or {{explosive}} decompression, forcing an emergency descent to below 10000 ft and preferably below 8000 ft, respectively the maximum temporary <b>safe</b> <b>altitude</b> for an unpressurized aircraft and the maximum <b>safe</b> <b>altitude</b> for extended duration.|$|R
50|$|Another anti-CFIT tool is the <b>Minimum</b> <b>Safe</b> <b>Altitude</b> Warning (MSAW) {{system which}} {{monitors}} the altitudes transmitted by aircraft transponders and compares {{that with the}} system's defined minimum safe altitudes for a given area.
