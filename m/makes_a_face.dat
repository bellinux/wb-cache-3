5000|$|In an {{interview}} with the music site [...] "ireallylovemusic", James Murphy (the leader of the group) explained his inspiration for the song: When I was DJing, playing Can, Liquid Liquid, ESG, all that kind of stuff, I became kind of cool for a moment, which was a total anomaly. And when I heard other DJs playing similar music I was like: 'Fuck! I'm out of a job! These are my records!' But it was like someone had crept into my brain and said all these words that I hate. Did I make the records? Did I fuck! So, I started becoming horrified by my own attitude. I had this moment of glory though. People would use me to DJ just to get them cool. They'd be like 'It's the cool rock disco guy' and this was really weird. And to be honest I was afraid that this new found coolness was going to go away and that's where ''''Losing My Edge'''' comes from. It is about being horrified by my own silliness. And then it became a wider thing about people who grip onto other people's creations like they are their own. There is a lot of pathos in that character though because it's born out of inadequacy and love. James Murphy In another interview, Murphy elaborated further on the birth and the release of the song:So I started going to different types of things and meeting different people, and started throwing parties. And all of a sudden, I was kind of cool, I'd always just been a total... not even an outsider, just sort of a nobody, a sort of invisible, sad and kind of shy. And all of a sudden I was DJing, and felt cool, throwing parties. And then one night I went to go see a band, and somebody else was playing the records that I was playing. Nobody else was playing the records that I was playing, that was sort of my thing! And I got really mad, and I got really defensive. And I was like 'What the heck, that's mine! What the--who the hell is this? Some 22-year-old...', and I got really embarassed sic? by being like 'These aren't your records, you didn't write them, you just... play them, you just own them, you can't be proud of yourself for owning them' but I was mad at the same time because I was like 'I know that kid was at one of my parties...'. It was this really dense conflict that I couldn't resolve, and that's where ''''Losing My Edge'''' came from. I didn't have a good answer. I was angry, but I was also pathetic for being angry. There wasn't really a right or wrong, you know? I was right and wrong, and this kid was right and wrong, and everybody there was right and wrong. It felt really dense, and really easy to write from. Easy to make something from. So I made that song, and everybody thought it was terrible. I remember playing it to people, and they'd give you this face (<b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>face</b> of surprise and doubt), you know, when they don't want to say anything! And they'd ask me about technical stuff like 'Oh, what are the drums?' and I was like 'OK, you don't like this'. And Phil Mossman, who was the original LCD guitar player, was the only person that was like 'I love this, I really love this, it's very funny'. So we put it out, and the people from the label, my two partners Tim and Jonathan afterwards said 'We just thought you were making a big mistake, you're gonna look like an idiot, and we just feel bad for you'. It was the B-side to 'Beat Connection' until the last minute. I thought 'No, that should be the A-side, that should be the one I should sink or swim with.|$|E

40|$|Perceptions of {{criminality}} and remorse {{are critical}} for legal decision-making. While faces perceived as criminal {{are more likely to}} be selected in police lineups and to receive guilty verdicts, faces perceived as remorseful are more likely to receive less severe punishment recommendations. To identify the information that <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>face</b> appear criminal and/or remorseful, we successfully used two different data-driven computational approaches that led to convergent findings: one relying on the use of computer-generated faces, and the other on photographs of people. In addition to visualising and validating the perceived looks of criminality and remorse, we report correlations with earlier face models of dominance, threat, trustworthiness, masculinity/femininity, and sadness. The new face models of criminal and remorseful appearance contribute to our understanding of perceived criminality and remorse. They can be used to study the effects of perceived criminality and remorse on decision-making; research that can ultimately inform legal policies...|$|E
40|$|What {{is it that}} <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>face</b> beautiful? Average faces {{obtained}} by photographic (Galton 1878) or digital (Langlois & Roggman 1990) blending are judged attractive but not optimally attractive (Alley & Cunningham 1991) [...] - digital exaggerations of deviations from average face blends can lead to higher attractiveness ratings (Perrett, May, & Yoshikawa 1994). My novel approach to face design does not involve blending at all. Instead, {{the image of a}} female face with high ratings is composed from a fractal geometry based on rotated squares and powers of two. The corresponding geometric rules are more specific than those previously used by artists such as Leonardo and Duerer. They yield a short algorithmic description of all facial characteristics, many of which are compactly encodable with the help of simple feature detectors similar to those found in mammalian brains. This suggests that a face's beauty correlates with simplicity relative to the subjective observer's way of encoding it...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the early}} twentieth century, psychologists have known that there is {{consensus}} in attributing social and personality characteristics from facial appearance. Recent {{studies have shown that}} surprisingly little time and effort are needed to arrive at this consensus. Here we review recent research on social attributions from faces. Section I outlines data-driven methods capable of identifying the perceptual basis of consensus in social attributions from faces (e. g., What <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>face</b> look threatening?). Section II describes nonperceptual determinants of social attributions (e. g., person knowledge and incidental associations). Section III discusses evidence that attributions from faces predict important social outcomes in diverse domains (e. g., investment decisions and leader selection). In Section IV, we argue that the diagnostic validity of these attributions has been greatly overstated in the literature. In the final section, we offer an account of the functional significance of these attributions.

40|$|Most {{of what we}} {{know about}} what <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>face</b> {{attractive}} and why we have the preferences we do is based on attractiveness ratings of static images of faces, usually photographs. However, several reports that such ratings fail to correlate significantly with ratings made to dynamic video clips, which provide richer samples of appearance, challenge the validity of this literature. Here, we tested the validity of attractiveness ratings made to static images, using a substantial sample of male faces. We found that these ratings agreed very strongly with ratings made to videos of these men, despite the presence of much more information in the videos (multiple views, neutral and smiling expressions and speech-related movements). Not surprisingly, given this high agreement, the components of video-attractiveness were also very similar to those reported previously for static-attractiveness. Specifically, averageness, symmetry and masculinity were all significant components of attractiveness rated from videos. Finally, regression analyses yielded very similar effects of attractiveness on success in obtaining sexual partners, whether attractiveness was rated from videos or static images. These results validate the widespread use of attractiveness ratings made to static images in evolutionary and social psychological research. We speculate that this validity may stem from our tendency to make rapid and robust judgements of attractiveness...|$|E
40|$|While our {{understanding}} of what <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>face</b> attractive has been greatly furthered in recent decades, the stimuli used {{in much of the}} foregoing research (static images with neutral expressions) bear little resemblance to the faces with which we nonnally interact. In our social interactions, we frequently evaluate faces that move and are expressive, and thus, it is important to evaluate whether motion and expression influence ratings of attractiveness; this was the central aim of the experiments in this dissertation. Using static and dynamic stimuli with neutral or positive expression, the effects of motion and expression were also tested in combination with other factors known to be relevant to attractiveness judgements: personality attributions, sex-typicality and cultural influence. In general, the results from this set of experiments show that judgements of moving, expressive stimuli do differ, sometimes radically, from judgements made of more traditional types of stimuli. Motion and positive expression were both found to increase ratings of attractiveness reliably in most experiments, as well as across cultures, and in some instances, showed strong sex-specific effects. Intriguing sex differences were also found in personality trait ratings of the stimuli, particularly for male faces; while criteria for female faces remained relatively constant across all conditions, trait ratings associated with attractiveness for male faces were dependent on particular combinations of motion and expression. Finally, in line with previous research, cross-cultural experiments showed general agreement between Japanese and Caucasian raters, but also suggested slight, culture-specific differences in preferences for expression and motion. IV This set of experiments has integrated the factors of motion, expression, sextypicality, personality and cultural influence together in order to bring a greater degree of ecological validity into attractiveness studies. These findings offer major implications for researchers studying attractiveness, particularly that of males, and suggest that motion and expression are important dimensions that should be considered in future research while simultaneously placing a caution on the interpretation of findings made with static stimuli. Suggestions are also made for further research in light of the present finding...|$|E
