5|$|Back at the caves, after {{informing the}} {{survivors}} why {{they went into}} the jungle and that Dr. Arzt (Daniel Roebuck) is dead, Jack decides that he is going after Kate and Locke. Upon reaching the Hatch, he finds no one there and rappels down the shaft on his own. While exploring, he comes across a painted mural, and a wall where the key hanging around his neck is pulled by a strong <b>magnetic</b> <b>force.</b> Finally, after being surprised by a bright light and loud music, he enters what appears to be an underground geodesic dome with computer equipment, including an Apple II Plus computer with its prompt glowing and its shift key relabeled execute. As Jack is about to use it, Locke appears and tells Jack not to touch it. After Jack raises the gun and asks where Kate is, Locke is revealed to be at gunpoint. The gunman threatens that he will shoot Locke if Jack does not surrender. Jack refuses, instead taunting Locke about his destiny. Finally, the gunman steps out and Jack seems to recognize him. The gunman is Desmond.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Desmond and Locke {{discuss the}} purpose of the {{stations}} and discover that when Desmond accidentally allowed the timer to run out, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>force</b> pulled Oceanic Flight 815 toward the island, thus causing the crash. Locke continues to doubt that the timer has any meaning, but Desmond assures him that it is all real. As the timer passes zero, Desmond retrieves a failsafe key and crawls underneath the hatch, saying he will blow the dam. After he turns the key in the system termination switch, a shrill humming noise and violet-white light envelops the entire island, causing the Oceanic 815 survivors and the Others alike {{on opposite sides of the}} island to bend in apparent pain. That night, Charlie is the only person to return from the hatch; the whereabouts of Desmond, Eko, and Locke are not revealed. Charlie reconnects with Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), and they kiss as they sit among their fellow plane survivors.|$|E

30|$|Zero-valent iron {{nanoparticles}} rapidly aggregate. One of {{the reasons}} is <b>magnetic</b> <b>forces</b> among the nanoparticles. Magnetic field around particles is caused by composition of the particles. Their core is formed from zero-valent iron, and shell is a layer of magnetite. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>forces</b> contribute to attractive forces among the nanoparticles and that leads to increasing of aggregation of the nanoparticles. This effect is undesirable for decreasing of remediation properties of iron particles and limited transport possibilities. The aggregation of iron nanoparticles was established for consequent processes: Brownian motion, sedimentation, velocity gradient of fluid around particles and electrostatic forces. In our previous work, an introduction of influence of <b>magnetic</b> <b>forces</b> among particles on the aggregation was presented. These forces have significant impact on the rate of aggregation. In this article, a numerical computation of <b>magnetic</b> <b>forces</b> between an aggregate and a nanoparticle and between two aggregates is shown. It is done for random position of nanoparticles in an aggregate and random or arranged directions of magnetic polarizations and for structured aggregates with arranged vectors of polarizations.

25|$|In magnetostatics, {{the force}} of {{attraction}} or repulsion between two current-carrying wires (see first figure below) is often called Ampère's force law.

We analyze both the PM and EM {{parts of the}} system. Magnetic circuit theory is first used to gain insight into the <b>magnetic</b> <b>forces</b> and allows for the dynamic analysis of a rigid rotor coupled with the magnetic bearings. The results re-veal that the <b>magnetic</b> <b>forces</b> are a strong nonlinear function of the rotor offsets from its equilibrium position.

25|$|Another technology, {{which was}} designed, proven mathematically, peer-reviewed, and patented, but is, as of May 2015, unbuilt, is magnetodynamic {{suspension}} (MDS).

Other technologies such as repulsive permanent magnets and superconducting magnets have seen some research.|$|E
25|$|The {{magnetic}} {{moments of}} atoms in a ferromagnetic material {{cause them to}} behave something like tiny permanent magnets. They stick together and align themselves into small regions of more or less uniform alignment called magnetic domains or Weiss domains. Magnetic domains can be observed with a <b>magnetic</b> <b>force</b> microscope to reveal magnetic domain boundaries that resemble white lines in the sketch. There are many scientific experiments that can physically show magnetic fields.|$|E
25|$|If a {{conductor}} moves with a constant velocity {{through the field}} of a stationary magnet, eddy currents will be produced due to a <b>magnetic</b> <b>force</b> on the electrons in the conductor. In the rest frame of the conductor, on the other hand, the magnet will be moving and the conductor stationary. Classical electromagnetic theory predicts that precisely the same microscopic eddy currents will be produced, {{but they will be}} due to an electric force.|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that systems with a parameter-controlled inverse cascade can exhibit critical behavior for {{which at the}} critical value of the control parameter the inverse cascade stops. In the vicinity of such a critical point standard phenomenological estimates for the energy balance will fail since the energy flux towards large length scales becomes zero. We demonstrate these concepts using the computationally tractable model of two-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamics in a periodic box. In {{the absence of any}} external <b>magnetic</b> <b>forcing</b> the system reduces to hydrodynamic fluid turbulence with an inverse energy cascade. In the presence of strong <b>magnetic</b> <b>forcing</b> the system behaves as 2 D magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence with forward energy cascade. As the amplitude of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>forcing</b> is varied a critical value is met for which the energy flux towards the large scales becomes zero. Close to this point the energy flux scales as a power law with the departure from the critical point and the normalized amplitude of the fluctuations diverges. Similar behavior is observed for the flux of the square vector potential for which no inverse flux is observed for weak <b>magnetic</b> <b>forcing,</b> while a finite inverse flux is observed for <b>magnetic</b> <b>forcing</b> above the critical point. We conjecture that this behavior is generic for systems of variable inverse cascade...|$|R

25|$|Low-voltage {{miniature}} {{circuit breakers}} (MCB) use air alone to extinguish the arc. These circuit breakers contain so-called arc chutes, a stack of mutually insulated parallel metal plates which divide and cool the arc. By splitting the arc into smaller arcs the arc is cooled down while the arc voltage is increased and serves as an additional impedance which limits the current through the circuit breaker. The current-carrying parts near the contacts provide easy deflection of the arc into the arc chutes by a <b>magnetic</b> <b>force</b> of a current path, although magnetic blowout coils or permanent magnets could also deflect the arc into the arc chute (used on circuit breakers for higher ratings).So The number of plates in the arc chute {{is dependent on the}} short-circuit rating and nominal voltage of the circuit breaker.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} example {{describes the}} operation of a spectrometer mass analyzer, which is of the sector type. (Other analyzer types are treated below.) Consider a sample of sodium chloride (table salt). In the ion source, the sample is vaporized (turned into gas) and ionized (transformed into electrically charged particles) into sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) ions. Sodium atoms and ions are monoisotopic, with a mass of about 23 u. Chloride atoms and ions come in two isotopes with masses of approximately 35 u (at a natural abundance of about 75 percent) and approximately 37 u (at a natural abundance of about 25 percent). The analyzer part of the spectrometer contains electric and magnetic fields, which exert forces on ions traveling through these fields. The speed of a charged particle may be increased or decreased while passing through the electric field, and its direction may be altered by the magnetic field. The magnitude of the deflection of the moving ion's trajectory depends on its mass-to-charge ratio. Lighter ions get deflected by the <b>magnetic</b> <b>force</b> more than heavier ions (based on Newton's second law of motion, F = ma). The streams of sorted ions pass from the analyzer to the detector, which records the relative abundance of each ion type. This information is {{used to determine the}} chemical element composition of the original sample (i.e. that both sodium and chlorine are present in the sample) and the isotopic composition of its constituents (the ratio of 35Cl to 37Cl).|$|E
