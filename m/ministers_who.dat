A month later, the presbytery licensed two <b>ministers</b> <b>who</b> could not affirm the virgin birth, and in February 1924, it acquitted Fosdick who subsequently left his post in the Presbyterian Church.|$|E
5|$|Whenever {{the emperor}} was absent from a court conference but sought its advice, he {{relied on the}} {{chancellor}} to direct it and inform him of the resulting majority opinion.

5|$|The Sovereign still {{exercised}} a {{power to}} be reckoned with in the eighteenth century. The Court remained the centre of the political world. The King was limited in that he had to choose <b>Ministers</b> <b>who</b> could command a majority in Parliament, but the choice remained his. The leader of an administration still had to command the King's personal confidence and approval. A strong following in Parliament depended on being able to supply places, pensions, and other marks of Royal favour to the government's supporters.|$|E

5|$|The party, or parties, {{that hold}} the {{majority}} of seats in the Parliament forms the Scottish Government. In contrast to many other parliamentary systems, Parliament elects a First Minister {{from a number of}} candidates {{at the beginning of each}} parliamentary term (after a general election). Any member can put their name forward to be First Minister, and a vote is taken by all members of Parliament. Normally, the leader of the largest party is returned as First Minister, and head of the Scottish Government. Theoretically, Parliament also elects the Scottish <b>Ministers</b> <b>who</b> form the government of Scotland and sit in the Scottish cabinet, but such ministers are, in practice, appointed to their roles by the First Minister. Junior <b>ministers,</b> <b>who</b> do not attend cabinet, are also appointed to assist Scottish ministers in their departments. Most ministers and their juniors are drawn from amongst the elected MSPs, with the exception of Scotland's Chief Law Officers: the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General. Whilst the First Minister chooses the ministers – and may decide to remove them at any time – the formal appointment or dismissal is made by the Sovereign.|$|E
5|$|The riots {{caused a}} major change in the government's {{approach}} to racial issues, and led to the introduction of an aggressive affirmative action policy strongly favouring the Malays, the New Economic Policy (NEP). The National Culture Policy, also introduced in 1970, emphasised an assimilation of the non-Malays into the Malay ethnic group. However, during the 1990s Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad rejected this approach, with his Bangsa Malaysia policy emphasising a Malaysian instead of Malay identity for the state. During the 2000s decade politicians began stressing ketuanan Melayu again, and publicly chastised government <b>ministers</b> <b>who</b> questioned the social contract.|$|E
5|$|Each {{state has}} a unicameral State Legislative Assembly whose members are elected from {{single-member}} constituencies. State governments are led by Chief <b>Ministers,</b> <b>who</b> are state assembly members from the majority party in the assembly. In each of the states with a hereditary ruler, the Chief Minister is normally required to be a Malay, appointed by the ruler upon {{the recommendation of the}} Prime Minister. Parliamentary elections are held at least once every five years, the most recent of which took place in May 2013. Registered voters of age 21 and above may vote for the members of the House of Representatives and, in most of the states, for the state legislative chamber. Voting is not mandatory. Except for state elections in Sarawak, by convention state elections are held concurrently with the federal election.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, a New Year's Eve benefit {{event was}} held for the Council on Religion and the Homosexual. Police stood outside with large floodlights, and {{in an effort to}} intimidate took {{photographs}} of anyone entering the building. Later, several officers demanded that they be allowed inside. Three lawyers explained to them that under California law, the event was a private party and they could not enter unless they bought tickets. The lawyers were then arrested. Several <b>ministers</b> <b>who</b> were in attendance held a press conference the next morning, likening the SFPD to the Gestapo. Even the Catholic archbishop strongly condemned the actions of the police. In an attempt to reduce such harassment two officers were tasked with improving the police department's relationship with the gay community.|$|E
5|$|On {{his trip}} to Israel in October 1985, Weizsäcker was greeted on arrival by his Israeli counterpart, President Chaim Herzog. The {{president}} was given a full honor-guard welcome at Ben-Gurion Airport; among Cabinet <b>ministers</b> <b>who</b> lined up {{to shake his hand}} were right-wingers of the Herut party, the main faction of Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud party, who had previously refused to greet German leaders. Weizsäcker's visit was the first by a head of state, but not the first by a West German leader, as Chancellor Willy Brandt had paid a visit to Israel in June 1973. During a four-day state visit to the United Kingdom in July 1986, Weizsäcker addressed a joint session of the Houses of Parliament, the first German to be accorded that honor.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after winning}} an {{increased}} {{majority in the}} 2008 election, Stelmach's cabinet approved substantial raises for themselves, increasing the salary paid to cabinet ministers from $142,000 to $184,000 and that paid to the Premier from $159,450 to $213,450. The increases also affect the severance paid to <b>ministers</b> <b>who</b> resign or are defeated in elections—under the program implemented by Ralph Klein's government to replace the previously existing pension program, departing MLAs receive three months' pay for every year they served, {{with the level of}} the pay based on their three highest-earning years. The increases were attacked by the Canadian Taxpayers Federation and the opposition parties, but Stelmach defended the raises as the first received by cabinet ministers in fifteen years and as being necessary to attract qualified people to politics.|$|E

5|$|The Atkinson Clock Tower near Bandaran Berjaya {{was built}} by Mary Edith Atkinson in 1905 in memory of her son, Francis George Atkinson. It was {{formerly}} used as a navigation aid for ships. It {{is only one of}} three pre-World War II buildings to survive the war. The Petagas War Memorial, located near KKIA, is a reminder of those who died when they went against the Japanese forces during World War II. It is situated at the place where the Kinabalu Guerrillas were killed by the Japanese army in 1944. The Double Six Monument, located in Sembulan, is also a memorial to remember Sabah's first Chief Minister and six other state <b>ministers</b> <b>who</b> died on a plane crash known as the Double Six Tragedy on 6 June 1976.|$|E
5|$|The emperor {{was at the}} {{pinnacle}} of Han society. He presided over the Han government but shared power with both the nobility and appointed <b>ministers</b> <b>who</b> came largely from the scholarly gentry class. The Han Empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government using an innovation inherited from the Qin known as commanderies, and a number of semi-autonomous kingdoms. These kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence, particularly following the Rebellion of the Seven States. From the reign of Emperor Wu (r.141–87 BC) onward, the Chinese court officially sponsored Confucianism in education and court politics, synthesized with the cosmology of later scholars such as Dong Zhongshu. This policy endured until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911 AD.|$|E
5|$|Walpole {{directed}} domestic policy, {{and after}} the resignation of his brother-in-law Townshend in 1730 also controlled George's foreign policy. Historians generally believe that George played an honorific role in Britain, and closely followed the advice of Walpole and senior <b>ministers</b> <b>who</b> made the major decisions. Although the king was eager for war in Europe, his ministers were more cautious. The Anglo-Spanish War was brought to an end, and George unsuccessfully pressed Walpole to join the War of the Polish Succession {{on the side of}} the German states. In April 1733, Walpole withdrew an unpopular excise bill that had gathered strong opposition, including from within his own party. George lent support to Walpole by dismissing the bill's opponents from their court offices.|$|E
