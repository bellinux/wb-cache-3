Hydrolysis of 1, 10 -phenanthrolinopyrrole ethyl ester leads to the acid derivative which is unstable at room-temperature releasing CO(2) and forming 1, 10 -phenanthrolinopyrrole (php). The ligand reacts with ruthenium(II) to form a series of complexes of the general formula [Ru(php) (n) (bpy) (3 -n) ](2 +), where bpy = 2, 2 '-bipyridine and n = 1 - 3. The photochemical properties reveal that the complexes have longer-lived excited states than the standard complex, [Ru(bpy) (3) ](2 +). Their emission lifetimes range from 9. 04 <b>micros</b> (n = 1) to 35. 5 <b>micros</b> (n = 3) at 77 K compared to 7. 57 <b>micros</b> for the standard. Similarly, at room-temperature, emission lifetimes range from 1. 20 <b>micros</b> (n = 1) to 1. 70 <b>micros</b> (n = 3) relative to the standard (0. 56 <b>micros).</b> The emission quantum yields also have higher values than the standard [Ru(bpy) (3) ](2 +) under similar conditions. The temperature-dependent studies for the complexes establish the distribution among the radiative, nonradiative, and (3) MLCT to (3) d-d decay channels and are in agreement with the energy gap law. peer reviewe...|$|R
