[...] Explaining his idea to his wife in the film, he says, [...] "I want to show everything, because every observation I make fits in with that.

Besides, he's relatively unknown, so Guan Yu won't be wary of him. This can't be better. If he's appointed, our enemies will be unaware of our intentions, while we can assess our strengths better and seek an opportunity to launch the attack." [...] Sun Quan followed Lü Meng's suggestion and commissioned Lu Xun as a Lieutenant-General (偏將軍) and Inspector of the Right Section (右部督) to replace Lü Meng in Jing Province.|$|E

60|$|A {{multitude}} of smaller errors, arising from anomalies {{in the distribution}} of temperature, will be apparent on consulting <b>my</b> <b>observations</b> on the temperature at various elevations in Sikkim; practically these are unavoidable. I have also calculated all <b>my</b> <b>observations</b> according to Professor J. Forbes's formula of 1 degree difference of temperature of boiling-water, being the equivalent of 550 feet at all elevations. (See Ed. Phil. Trans., vol xv. p. 405.) The formula is certainly not applicable to the Sikkim Himalaya; on the contrary, <b>my</b> <b>observations</b> show that the formula employed for Boileau's tables gives at all ordinary elevations so very close an approach to accuracy on the mean of many observations, that no material improvement in its construction is to be anticipated.|$|E
