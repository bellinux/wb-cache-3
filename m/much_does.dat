After the race, Jeff Gordon (who was {{involved}} in the lap-137 accident) was less optimistic about his championship chances: [...] "This pretty <b>much</b> <b>does</b> it for us as far as I'm concerned for the championship. You knew exactly that something like that was going to happen." [...] In the Manufacturers' Championship Chevrolet increased its point total to 231; Dodge moved into second place with 180 and Ford was a close third with 179. The race took three hours, ten minutes and twenty-three seconds to complete; because it ended under caution, no margin of victory was recorded.|$|E

500|$|In his 1980 commentary, Philip K. Dick {{pointed out}} the moral {{ambiguity}} of the story, laying out its political implications: [...] "Should we have a leader or should we think for ourselves? Obviously the latter, in principle. But – sometimes there lies a gulf between what is theoretically right and that which is practical." [...] This quote became {{part of a larger}} political analysis of Dick's work in How <b>Much</b> <b>Does</b> Chaos Scare You? by Aaron Barlow, Associate Professor of English at New York City College of Technology. In analyzing Dick's short fiction, Barlow presented their themes against the backdrop of post-September 11, 2001 America. In particular, Barlow compared many of the philosophical underpinnings of Neoconservatism, and its rise to prominence during the George W. Bush administration, to the philosophy of Philip K. Dick. [...] "To ," [...] writes Barlow, [...] "the elites were both alien and dangerous. To him, the focus of vision and of political debate should never be on the rulers, but on the little person, the shopkeeper, the mechanic." [...] In his dissection of Dick's work, Barlow compared several stories in which normal humans lose some form of liberty in their society to an elite group. Examples presented include [...] "Autofac", [...] "Null-O", and [...] "Some Kinds of Life". From these stories, Barlow drew three themes important to Dick's anti-government writings: first, that humanity is often doomed by institutions of power created by the humans themselves; second, that paranoia is a natural aspect of governance, as [...] "o elite can ever completely trust the people it governs," [...] and this distrust leaves a governed people in perpetual danger; and third, that the belief that individuality must be sacrificed—either for the sake of social stability or survival—is a constant threat. [...] "To Dick," [...] Barlow adds, [...] "there are few attitudes more dangerous than this." [...] Each of these themes would be revisited in [...] "The Last of the Masters".|$|E

2500|$|By {{the second}} half of the 18th century Philadelphia had {{developed}} an upper-class society. Many of the families that made up the upper class could trace their lineage to the earliest Quaker settlers, though many of these had subsequently joined the Church of England or Presbyterian denominations. The Philadelphia upper class was exclusive; what mattered was a person's family, not a person's wealth. Inheritance was better than self-made wealth. In the late 19th century Mark Twain observed, [...] "In Boston they ask how <b>much</b> <b>does</b> he know. In New York, how much is he worth. In Philadelphia, who were his parents." [...] A person could not enter Philadelphia society by acquisition of wealth, but their offspring, if they grew up well and married into the right family, could create a new lineage if the family stayed respectable.|$|E

2500|$|In 2015, Deming {{suggested}} [...] "There's {{just one}} problem with the gay agenda: it's based on a lie. Homosexuals are not like heterosexuals, nor is the practice of homosexuality innocuous. The single largest problem for the gay agenda is medical science. [...] The fact that about two-thirds of syphilis and AIDS cases occur amongst {{one percent of the}} population tells us something that is immediate and unambiguous: that homosexuality is not an innocuous choice. What gay men do behind closed doors is fundamentally different from what heterosexuals usually do in their bedrooms. [...] We are informed, endlessly, of the costs of gun violence, cigarette smoking, and obesity. What is the cost of homosexuality? How <b>much</b> <b>does</b> it cost to treat syphilis, AIDS, and a whole host of other diseases? What cost will we bear for the reemergence of syphilis, a disease that was almost eradicated?

2500|$|As {{the bond}} {{referendum}} approached, the Houston Chronicle requested that Texans for True Mobility (TTM), the main critic of METRORail, provide {{the paper with}} a copy of their financial contributor reports. TTM declined, saying they did not believe the Chronicle would adequately protect the privacy of their donors. The Chronicle responded by making a complaint to the Harris County District Attorney's office asking that Texans for True Mobility be investigated for potential violations of Texas election law. The Chronicle alleged that TTM broke a law requiring PACs to disclose their donors. TTM said that their status as a registered non-profit 501(c)(6) organization, as opposed to a PAC, did not require them to do so. The Chronicle argued that the law covered TTM because it made [...] "paid political moves." [...] Texas campaign law allows nonprofits to run [...] "educational" [...] advertisements, but those advertisements cannot endorse specific political positions or people or make a specific recommendation in a pending election. The dispute was over whether TTM's advertisements, and specifically the slogans [...] "Metro's Rail Plan Costs Too <b>Much</b> ... <b>Does</b> Too Little" [...] and [...] "Metro's Plan Won't Work Here," [...] were specific recommendations on how to vote.|$|E

He was heavily {{critical of the}} deception and evasion minigames, and although he thought the Alethiometer gameplay was interesting, he felt its almost wholly optional nature in the game undermined it. He was most critical, however, of the plot; [...] "The story is a mess standing on its own [...] The game makes little attempt to portray Pullman's world, instead opting to magpie scenes from the film and career through the story with little concession for the player." [...] Ryan Clements rated the PC version 3.5 out of 10 arguing [...] "the game {{is all over the}} place and pretty <b>much</b> <b>does</b> nothing well." [...] As with Robinson, he was highly critical of the plot, which he argued was incomprehensible unless the player was familiar with the novel or the film. He concluded, [...] "Besides lousy gameplay, The Golden Compass has little else worth mentioning. The graphics, regardless of which system you play on, don't push the hardware at all. The sound is almost never properly synchronized with what's happening on the screen, and the overall presentation is embarrassingly cheap." ...|$|E
