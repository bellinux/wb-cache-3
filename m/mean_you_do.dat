It's kind of a pipe dream, it's a {{personal}} fantasy of mine, but I don't think it's going to happen. And it is a good way of making the point that women are voting so stupidly, at least single women.It also makes the point, it is kind of embarrassing, the Democratic Party ought to be hanging its head in shame, that it has so much difficulty getting men to vote for it. I <b>mean,</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> see it's the party of women and 'We'll pay for health care and tuition and day care—and here, what else can we give you, soccer moms?' In addition to questioning whether women's right to vote is a good thing, Coulter has also appeared on Fox News and advocated for a poll tax and a literacy test for voters (this was in 1999, and she reiterated her support of a literacy test in 2015). This is not a viewpoint widely shared by members of the Republican Party.|$|E
5000|$|In August, 2006, at the 64th World Science Fiction Convention, in a give-and-take {{with her}} audience, Willis {{described}} her novel-in-progress: [...] "It's about World War 2, and I have four historians... One {{of them is}} with the evacuating children in the North of England; {{one of them is}} doing the Blitz; one of them is doing the civilian evacuation from Dunkirk, of soldiers but by civilians; {{and one of them is}} doing the Intelligence War involved in the lead-up to D-Day, where they fooled Hitler into thinking we were attacking at Calais, instead of at Normandy. And their lives are hopelessly intertwined; but then they all get in trouble - you know my books - they all get in terrible trouble and can't get out of it. And are stuck in World War II, for God's sake! So: Not a safe place to be." [...] (An audience member called, [...] "Better than the Plague!") Willis laughed but replied, [...] "Not necessarily better than the Plague! In slightly better survival chance because they have the advantage of some knowledge that the locals don't have, but then again, historical events are notoriously inaccurate, and just because you think you know where all the bombs fell, doesn't <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> So that will figure heavily in the book... I have a lot of stuff to tell you about the war... The Brits were absolutely wonderful... They were great and plucky and funny under pressure." ...|$|E

To add insult to injury, he was black-flagged for having too many crew members over the wall {{and was forced to}} serve a drive-through penalty. Kurt Busch kicked off a cycle of green flag stops on lap 231. Logano pitted on lap 232 and gave the lead to Austin Dillon. He pitted the next lap and gave the lead to Jeff Gordon. He pitted on lap 234 and gave the lead to Clint Bowyer. He pitted the next lap and handed the lead to Sam Hornish, Jr. The ninth caution of the race flew with 95 laps to go for a single-car wreck in turn 3. Matt Kenseth suffered a right-front tire blowout and slammed the wall. He said that he's taking the Contender Round [...] "one race at a time to be honest with you. I <b>mean,</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> the best you can every week and if this is the best I can do it’s amazing I have a job. These are never the kind of days you want to have for sure, but it’s just one of those days. We shouldn’t have ever been back there to start with. My mistakes and they cost us today. So we’ll just move on from this and get ready for Kansas.” Hornish pitted under the caution and handed the lead back to Joey Logano.|$|E

Books like Julia Child’s Mastering the Art of French Cooking (1961) and the Revised and Enlarged Edition of The New Settlement Cook Book (1954). Newer paper backs for health-conscious yuppies with names like “Lonely Planet. ” Books full of recipes for preparing MSG-free food. Problem? Yes! For today, {{only some of the}} ingredients in these recipes, not all of the ingredients in these recipes, will be MSG-free. Today, some ingredients will contain MSG, and you won’t have a clue to which do and which don’t – until you pick up The Real Food Recipeless CookBook. Want to cut back on the amount of MSG you’re ingesting? But not necessarily eliminate all MSG from your diet? Then you’ll want to carefully review the names of ingredients in which MSG is hidden (Table 2) – to become better informed. But you’ll want to eliminate the ingredients listed in Table 1. Want to eliminate all MSG from your diet? Then you need to read it all. Do you care about avoiding MSG? We think you should, but that doesn’t <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Just remember that while this may be more about MSG than you think you want to know, it will be a life-line for others. And it wouldn’t hurt to pass it on to family and friends who may be more sensitive, or more health-conscious, than you. Finally, give some thought to vegetarians that you know. MSG presents a special challenge for people on vegetarian diets. You can do it. Yes you can. Even the most sensitive can. Jack did it this way.
