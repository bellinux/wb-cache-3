The <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>effect</b> of this on employment is called the Pigou effect, but whether or not this acts as a significant brake on a deflationary spiral is controversial.

Sentiment is measured using the Baker-Wurgler (2006) sentiment index. We estimate the effect of sentiment on intertemporal tradeoffs.

40|$|In this paper, {{a dynamic}} general {{equilibrium}} (DGE) model of growth–inequality relationships, with missing credit markets, knowledge spillover and self-employed agents, is calibrated to New Zealand data. The model explains how two distinct policy shocks involving redistribution and immigration imply, subsequently, two completely opposite outcomes. Agents’ inability to borrow aggravates a negative <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>effect</b> of heterogeneity on growth. Redistribution mitigates that effect but creates microeconomic disincentives on saving and work-effort. Consequently, immigration shocks that perturb variance of efficiency induce a negative growth–inequality relationship, while redistribution shocks, in New Zealand’s case, produce larger fluctuations in incentives than in macro benefits, implying a positive growth–inequality relationship. <br /...|$|E

Using the model, we show that LTC decreases the steady state level of capital stock, but that it enhances the welfare level in an aging economy, when the rate of tax is sufficiently small.

It also examines a related hypothesis that such a transitory oil price hike would have little or no <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>effect.</b> It surveys and rejects arguments for a reduced impact of oil price shocks and for hysteresis. The article argues that recent experience was comparable in magnitude to earlier shocks and that there were comparable macroeconomic developments and changes in the composition of output. The paper concludes with a test of the effect of energy prices on the misery index and shows that recent changes in misery are consistent with previous experience. ...|$|E

Several factors shape the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>effects</b> of public investment. When there is economic slack and monetary accommodation, demand effects are stronger, and the public-debt-to-GDP ratio may actually decline. Public investment is also more effective in boosting output in countries with higher public investment efficiency and when it is financed by issuing debt...|$|R

It contains about 100 papers of which 43 study whether development aid increases accumulation in the recipient country.

The aggregate result is thus an unclear effect on accumulation, but with regional differences. When only studies of Latin American or Asian economies are considered, a small positive and statistically significant investment effect is found, together with a small negative effect on domestic savings. We conclude that in Asia and Latin America, aid is a substitute to domestic savings, but has a net positive impact on investment. Aid effectiveness, meta study, investments, savings...|$|E
