40|$|The <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> {{earlier in}} the product {{development}} process, necessitates a re-examination of the total supply network. Supply chain literature has traditionally examined procurement and value-adding activities, without explicitly defining product development {{as part of the}}se. The trend towards outsourcing design activities is bringing recognition for this process as part of the total supply network. The objective {{of this paper is to}} determine the degree of early supplier involvement (ESI) that exists between a multinational electronics company and its key suppliers, in terms of depth of integration, information exchange and buyer-supplier relationships. The paper provides insights into the strategic factors that affect the dynamics of the ESI process. Such insights are valuable in terms of gaining a greater understanding of how the ESI process is managed and determining the barriers to effective supplier integration. The research indicates that there are considerable impediments for those participants responsible for establishing and managing the implementation of ESI. A number of strategic insights are identified that explain the existence of the impediments to the ESI process. Finally, based upon the findings a number of lessons are highlighted for organisations considering the adoption of the ESI process. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} is the logical continuation of several previous studies concerning the relations mutually connecting {{the configuration of the}} urban grid, the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> in the urban settlement, and the location of these activities. Those studies were aimed at verifying the reliability of the hypothesis on which configurational analysisis based (Hillier, Hanson, 1984, Hillier, 1996 a) : the role of the urban grid (appraised in configurational terms, that is to say, with regard only to the spatial relations mutually connecting all its paths) as the primary element both in the production of movement and in the location of activities. Such an assumption, if proved, should allow the prediction of the distribution of pedestrian flows and the location of urban activities on the mere basis of the configuration of the grid, making it possible to set aside the issue of the presence and position of the located activities. In the research that has been conducted so far (Cutini, 1999 a; Cutini, 1999 b), we have actually proved the existence of a significant correlation between configuration and pedestrian movement, while at the same specifying its limits : the correlation, very clear within limited sub-systems of the overall grid, becomes dramatically weaker if extended over the whole grid. In this study, we have taken land use into consideration, extending the analysis to the correlation between the presence of the located activities and the distribution of configurational indexes. The research has focused on the two case studies that had been previously selected and analysed; the test on a third urban case, which was chosen as a particularly significant example, provides further confirmation of the results to date. These results make it possible to prove that the methods of configurational analysis (Hillier, 1996 a) provide a reliable predictive tool for determining the capacity of each part of the urban settlement to create activities and enable them to flourish; at the same time, we have also been able to pinpoint the range of reliability of these methods. In other words, the results obtained provide a new definition of the notion of urban centrality, appraised in terms of attractiveness, setting aside the actual presence and position of the located activities. Furthermore, {{on the basis of these}} results, the location of monopolistic activities emerges as a strategic variable in town planning and management...|$|E

40|$|Using {{the novel}} {{apparatus}} KUROBOX, learning and memory behaviors, {{as well as}} various parameters <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> <b>activity,</b> were reevaluated in mice deficient for nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor (NOP-/- mice) or mu-opioid receptor (MOP-/- mice). This method has the advantages that no handling procedures are required throughout the experiments performed over 3 days, positive cue paradigms are used without water or shock stress, and the method does not disturb the nocturnal habit of mice. NOP-/- mice displayed a significant enhancement of learning and memory under stress-free conditions, {{but there were no}} changes in the various physical and psychological parameters <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> <b>activity</b> (nest stay ratio, distance moved, speed and angle in the movement) and biological rhythm that were measured. Enhancement of nocturnal learning was observed during the first 12 -h dark cycle, and enhancement of memory was observed {{at the beginning of the}} second dark cycle in NOP-/- mice. In contrast, MOP-/- mice showed no significant change in learning and memory behaviors or in physical and psychological parameters <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> <b>activity,</b> except for speed, MOP-/- mice showed a significant decrease in speed <b>of</b> <b>movement.</b> Thus, the KUROBOX apparatus provides a useful alternative method to evaluate learning and memory activity under the more physiological conditions. In addition, this apparatus has an advantage that various physical and psychological parameters <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> <b>activity</b> affecting learning and memory behavior are also evaluated at the same time...|$|R

40|$|In humans, {{when the}} {{stability}} of the trunk is challenged in a controlled manner by repetitive <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> a limb, <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> the diaphragm becomes tonic but is also modulated at the frequency <b>of</b> limb <b>movement.</b> In addition, the tonic activity is modulated by respiration. This study investigated the mechanical output of these components <b>of</b> diaphragm <b>activity.</b> Recordings were made of costal diaphragm, abdominal, and erector spinae muscle electromyographic activity; intra-abdominal, intrathoracic, and transdiaphragmatic pressures; and motion of the rib cage, abdomen, and arm. During limb movement the diaphragm and transversus abdominis were tonically active with added phasic modulation at the frequencies of both respiration and limb <b>movement.</b> <b>Activity</b> <b>of</b> the other trunk muscles was not modulated by respiration. Intra-abdominal pressure was increased during the period <b>of</b> limb <b>movement</b> in proportion to the reactive forces from the movement.

50|$|As {{the idea}} of retinal waves became established, {{neurobiologist}} Carla Shatz used calcium imaging and microelectrode recording to visualize the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> action potentials in a wave-like formation.

The calcium imaging showed ganglion cells initiating the formation of retinal waves, along with adjacent amacrine cells, which {{take part in the}} <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> the electrical <b>activity.</b> Microelectrode recordings were also thought to show LGN neurons being driven by the wave-like formation <b>of</b> electrical <b>activity</b> across neighboring retinal ganglion cells.

50|$|One of {{the first}} {{scientists}} to theorize the existence of spontaneous cascades <b>of</b> electrical <b>activity</b> during retinal development was, computational neurobiologist David J. Willshaw. He proposed that adjacent cells generate electrical activity in a wave-like formation through layers of interconnected pre-synaptic and postsynaptic cells. Activity propagating through a close span of pre- and postsynaptic cells is thought to result in strong electrical activity in comparison to pre- and postsynaptic cells that are farther apart, which results in weaker activity. Willshaw thought this difference in firing strength and location of cells was responsible for determining the activities boundaries. The lateral <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> firing from neighboring cell to neighboring cell, starting in one random area of cells and moving throughout both the pre- and postsynaptic layers, {{is thought to be}} responsible for the formation of the retinotopic map. To simulate the cascade <b>of</b> electrical <b>activity,</b> Willshaw wrote a computer program to demonstrate the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> electrical <b>activity</b> between pre- and postsynaptic cell layers. What Willshaw called spontaneous patterned electrical activity is today referred to as retinal waves.|$|R
