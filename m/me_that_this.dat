500|$|On 23 April 1864, Smetana {{conducted}} Berlioz's choral symphony Roméo et Juliette at {{a concert}} celebrating the Shakespeare tercentenary, adding to the programme his own March for the Shakespearean Festival. That year, Smetana's bid to become Director of the Prague Conservatory failed. He had set high hopes on this appointment: [...] "My friends are trying to persuade <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> post might have been especially created for me," [...] he wrote to a Swedish friend. Again his hopes were thwarted by his association with the perceived radical Liszt, and the appointing committee chose the conservative patriot Josef Krejčí for the post.|$|E

500|$|In April 2010, after {{eighteen}} months of negotiations, {{the deal was}} reportedly suspended; reports cited French concerns about Pakistan's financial situation, the protection of sensitive French technology, and lobbying by the Indian government, which operates many French-built aircraft. France wanted the PAF to purchase several Mirage 2000-9 fighters from the United Arab Emirates Air Force, which would overlap with the upgraded JF-17. In July 2010, the PAF's Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Rao Qamar Suleman, said these reports were false. He said, [...] "I have had discussions with French Government officials who have assured <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is not the position of their government". Suleman also speculated that [...] "someone was trying to cause mischiefto put pressure on France not to supply the avionics we want".|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 17 February 1952, Ian Fleming started writing what would become his first book, Casino Royale, at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica. He typed out 2,000 words in the morning, {{directly}} from his own experiences and imagination and finished work on the manuscript in just over a month, completing it on 18 March 1952. Fleming took the name for his character {{from that of the}} American ornithologist James Bond, a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies; Fleming, a keen birdwatcher himself, had a copy of Bond's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist's wife that [...] "It struck <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born".|$|E

500|$|John Kerr as Francis Barnard. [...] The Tony Award-winning actor (for Tea and Sympathy (1955)) {{had been}} a once-promising leading man in the 1950s, {{featured}} in major roles in the theatrical film versions of Tea and Sympathy (1956) and Rodgers and Hammerstein's South Pacific (1958). His role as the nominal hero in Pit {{would prove to be}} the last notable film appearance of his career. [...] Years later, Kerr expressed surprise that Pit seemed to be his best remembered role, [...] "If you had told me years ago that Pit and the Pendulum would be The One out of all the stuff I've done, if you had told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would be the cult-type movie that people would be collecting memorabilia on, I would have said, 'You're out of your gourd.' Just ... no way. Noooo way!" ...|$|E
500|$|Although Either/Or was Kierkegaard's {{first major}} book, {{it was one}} of his last books to be {{translated}} into English, as late as 1944. Frederick DeW. Bolman, Jr. insisted that reviewers consider the book in this way: [...] "In general, {{we have a right to}} discover, if we can, the meaning of a work as comprehensive as Either/Or, considering it upon its own merits and not reducing the meaning so as to fit into the author's later perspective. It occurred to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was a service to understanding Kierkegaard, whose esthetic and ethical insights have been much slighted by those enamored of his religion of renunciation and transcendence. ... Kierkegaard's brilliance seems to me to be showing that while goodness, truth, and beauty can not speculatively be derived one from another, yet these three are integrally related in the dynamics of a healthy character structure".|$|E
500|$|The {{so-called}} [...] "cyber-kidnapping" [...] {{portrayed in}} [...] "Weeping Willow" [...] {{is believed to}} be the first such crime ever portrayed on television. While the writers and producers prepared the episode, several district attorneys they consulted said the law was dangerously vague regarding what charges could be filed in the event of such a real-life cyber-kidnapping; Wright said, [...] "They told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is a real problem, that there's a lag between what's on the books now and what's happening out there." [...] The script also includes a difficulty on the part of the detectives in coping and dealing this new form of cyber-crime and differentiating the truth from the hoax; Leight said, [...] "Their biggest frustration is trying to understand what's real and what isn't. Does this woman, Willow, really exist, and has something happened to her? Is she playing a character and a game that's gotten out of hand? And how do you locate someone in cyberspace?" ...|$|E

500|$|In September 2000, Herndon {{reunited with}} McBride and Thomas after meeting {{them at a}} party at the Handlebar-J Restaurant & Bar in Scottsdale, Arizona, to {{celebrate}} the club's 25th anniversary. After they performed [...] "No More Cryin'" [...] there, Herndon suggested that they officially reunite as McBride & the Ride, saying [...] "This thing in my gut was telling <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was the right time for this." [...] The trio recorded demo tapes and began searching for a record deal, signing to the independent Dualtone Records in 2002. Working with pianist and record producer Matt Rollings, McBride & the Ride recorded its only album for Dualtone, titled Amarillo Sky, and released it in September of that year. Unlike previous albums, the band wrote most of the songs and played most of the instruments itself because, according to Thomas, [...] "Terry thought this would be even more of a band-like situation if we wrote together more.

500|$|During World War II, Miller {{served as}} part of a bomber crew that participated in the {{destruction}} of the ancient Roman Catholic monastery at Monte Cassino, Italy, founded by St. Benedict in the 6thcentury. This experience impressed him enough to write, a decade later, the short story [...] "A Canticle for Leibowitz" [...] about an order of monks whose abbey springs from the destroyed world around it. The story, which would evolve into [...] "Fiat Homo," [...] {{the first part of the}} novel, was published in the April 1955 edition of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction (F). Although not originally intended as a serialization, the saga continued in [...] "And the Light Is Risen," [...] which was published in August 1956 (also in F). That work would later grow into [...] "Fiat Lux." [...] It was while writing the third [...] "novelette," [...] "The Last Canticle," [...] for magazine publication in February of the following year that Miller realized he was really completing a novel: [...] "Only after I had written the first two and was working on the third did it dawn on <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> isn't three novelettes, it's a novel. And I converted it." ...|$|E
500|$|He was billeted with Alexander, who {{was working}} in Hut 8, the {{counterpart}} to Hut 6 working on German Naval Enigma. Their close friendship let them easily resolve the competing needs of their sections for the limited available bombe time. By October 1941, he was deputy head of Hut 6 under Welchman. At this time, Bletchley Park was experiencing a shortage of clerical staff which was delaying the work on Enigma, and the management of GCCS appeared unable to obtain the resources needed. This affected both Hut 6 and Hut 8, which was run by mathematician Alan Turing with Hugh Alexander as his deputy. Together, Welchman, Milner-Barry, Turing and Alexander bypassed {{the chain of command}} and wrote a memorandum directly to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, outlining their difficulties. It fell to Milner-Barry to deliver the message to 10 Downing Street in person, on 21 October 1941. The next day, Churchill responded, [...] "Action this day: Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> has been done."

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] {{was directed by}} Bryan Barber and choreographed by Jeri Slaugher. After seeing a trailer of Barber's film project, Idlewild, Aguilera {{wanted to make a}} video directed by him, explained: [...] "It intrigued <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> man, Bryan Barber, had been very locked into and had surrounded himself with this whole world of the '20s and '30s era, and it made me think that he could understand what I'm trying to do conceptually. I needed to get the right director who shared my vision". At first Aguilera planned to make a black-and-white video and shot it in her living room for Barber and Slaugher. [...] "I had acted out the entire video in my living room. I used my fireplace as a makeshift stage and the staircase as the pool table where I would stand", said Aguilera. According to Barber, Aguilera was very involved in the making of the videot. The whole team seemed like they were doing a movie more than a music video. On June 21, 2006, the music video for [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] was premiered on MTV's Total Request Live.|$|E
500|$|Director Mamoru Oshii stated, [...] "My intuition told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{story about}} a futuristic world carried an {{immediate}} message for our present world. I am also interested in computers through my own personal experience with them. I had the same feeling about Patlabor and I {{thought it would be}} interesting to make a film that took place in the near future. There are only a few movies, even out of Hollywood, which clearly portray the influence and power of computers. I thought this theme would be more effectively conveyed through animation." [...] Oshii expanded on these thoughts in a later interview, noting that technology changes people and had become a part of the culture of Japan. He commented that his use of philosophy caused producers to become frustrated because of sparing use of action scenes. Oshii also acknowledged that a movie with more action would sell better, but he continued to make these movies anyway. When Oshii went back to make changes to the original Ghost in the Shell to re-release it as Ghost in the Shell 2.0, one of the reasons he gave was that the film did not resemble the sequel. He wanted to update the film to reflect changes in perspective.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Pascu {{experienced}} {{his first}} significant success in music with the album Mixed Grill {{and the single}} [...] "Ţara arde şi babele se piaptănă" [...] ("The Country Is Burning and Old Women Are Combing Their Hair", referencing a Romanian proverb). A poll conducted by the journal Evenimentul Zilei nominated the track as the best song of 1993, and the nationwide station Radio Contact awarded Pascu its [...] "Composer of the Year" [...] title. Mixed Grill marked Pascu's brief experimentation with a fusion of rock and reggae. [...] Hits such as [...] "Gizzi" [...] and [...] "Mi-am luat colac" [...] ("I Got Me a Lifebuoy") led some to consider {{him one of the}} pioneers of Romanian reggae, years ahead of acts like El Negro and Pacha Man. The mix of genres became characteristic of Pascu's work in music: [...] "When I was writing records, I figured that, should someone, say, be playing my record at a party, they would have several kinds to choose from, and they would not grow bored. But it's not because of that, I think that's how inspiration visits <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is how I write. I won't stick to any one musical genre." [...] In addition to the piano, guitar and drums, Pascu also began playing the harmonica.|$|E
