25|$|The decay {{distributions}} {{of the electron}} in muon decays have been parameterised using the so-called Michel parameters. The values of these four parameters are predicted unambiguously in the Standard Model of particle physics, thus muon decays represent a good test of the space-time structure of the weak interaction. No deviation from the Standard <b>Model</b> <b>predictions</b> has yet been found.|$|E
25|$|Methods for the {{identification}} of summary statistics that could also simultaneously assess the influence on the approximation of the posterior would be of substantial value. This is because the choice of summary statistics and the choice of tolerance constitute two sources of error in the resulting posterior distribution. These errors may corrupt the ranking of models and may also lead to incorrect <b>model</b> <b>predictions.</b> Indeed, none of the methods above assesses the choice of summaries {{for the purpose of}} model selection.|$|E
40|$|Aiming at the {{irregularity}} of nonlinear {{signal and}} its predicting difficulty, a deep learning <b>prediction</b> <b>model</b> based on extreme-point symmetric mode decomposition (ESMD) and clustering analysis is proposed. Firstly, the original data is decomposed by ESMD {{to obtain the}} finite number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and residuals. Secondly, the fuzzy c-means is used to cluster the decomposed components, and then the deep belief network (DBN) is used to predict it. Finally, the reconstructed IMFs and residuals are the final prediction results. Six kinds of <b>prediction</b> <b>models</b> are compared, which are DBN <b>prediction</b> <b>model,</b> EMD-DBN <b>prediction</b> <b>model,</b> EEMD-DBN <b>prediction</b> <b>model,</b> CEEMD-DBN <b>prediction</b> <b>model,</b> ESMD-DBN <b>prediction</b> <b>model,</b> and the proposed model in this paper.

30|$|In {{order to}} further {{reduce the amount}} of data transmission, <b>model</b> <b>prediction</b> {{strategy}} is proposed. The <b>prediction</b> <b>model</b> is integrated in OTR-O, which will be evolved into OTR-I. The strategy will set correction interval depending on the demand of control accuracy. In the correction interval, index model is used in OTR-I to predict the equipment states. When the correction interval reaches, the regional aggregator will collect costumer’s real data to correct the <b>prediction</b> <b>model.</b> The <b>model</b> <b>prediction</b> strategy can be described in (26) and (27).|$|R
25|$|The {{shape of}} the {{shoreline}} and the ocean floor changes the way that tides propagate, {{so there is no}} simple, general rule that predicts the time of high water from the Moon's position in the sky. Coastal characteristics such as underwater bathymetry and coastline shape mean that individual location characteristics affect tide forecasting; actual high water time and height may differ from <b>model</b> <b>predictions</b> due to the coastal morphology's effects on tidal flow. However, for a given location the relationship between lunar altitude and the time of high or low tide (the lunitidal interval) is relatively constant and predictable, as is the time of high or low tide relative to other points on the same coast. For example, the high tide at Norfolk, Virginia, U.S., predictably occurs approximately {{two and a half hours}} before the Moon passes directly overhead.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, {{fundamentally}} novel {{approaches for}} model choice that incorporate quality control {{as an integral}} {{step in the process}} have recently been proposed. ABC allows, by construction, estimation of the discrepancies between the observed data and the <b>model</b> <b>predictions,</b> with respect to a comprehensive set of statistics. These statistics are not necessarily the same as those used in the acceptance criterion. The resulting discrepancy distributions have been used for selecting models that are in agreement with many aspects of the data simultaneously, and model inconsistency is detected from conflicting and co-dependent summaries. Another quality-control-based method for model selection employs ABC to approximate the effective number of model parameters and the deviance of the posterior predictive distributions of summaries and parameters. The deviance information criterion is then used as measure of model fit. It has also been shown that the models preferred based on this criterion can conflict with those supported by Bayes factors. For this reason, it is useful to combine different methods for model selection to obtain correct conclusions.|$|E
25|$|Thirty {{years ago}} there was neither real {{predictability}} nor qualitative understanding of the dominant mechanisms in emulsion polymerisation. Mechanisms had been ‘proved’ by comparing <b>model</b> <b>predictions</b> with experimental data. The data field was limited and the models had many adjustable parameters, or else fitting parameters had values that were subject to wide uncertainty: {{it was possible to}} choose values that could suit any model. It was not uncommon to find two papers claiming that quite different mechanisms were dominant in the same system, a result {{of not being able to}} isolate the individual steps. As a result of Gilbert’s work, all individual processes in emulsion polymerisation, one of the commonest ways of making everyday products, are now qualitatively and quantitatively understood. It is now possible to polymerise simple systems and to predict the molecular architecture that will be formed under chosen conditions, while for more complex conditions, trends can be semiquantitatively predicted and understood. The international scientific and technical community in this field now uses the mechanistic knowledge that he obtained as the key to understanding current processes and creating new processes and products. His work has put this industrially important field on a rigorous scientific footing.|$|E

In this paper the efficiency of the SWAT <b>model</b> for discharge <b>prediction</b> in partially gauged semi-arid catchment is evaluated and the <b>model</b> <b>prediction</b> uncertainty is assessed using the GLUE approach. Based on the results, SWAT can be used to predict the discharge in semi-arid catchment but its efficiency is marked with high variability due to the inter-annual variability of rainfall. The uncertainty analysis of the <b>model</b> <b>prediction</b> suggests that <b>model</b> parameters uncertainty alone cannot compensate for all uncertainty sources and that in order to provide more realistic uncertainty estimation all uncertainty sources have to be considered...|$|R

500|$|A {{vigorous}} tropical wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa late on August 20, and almost immediately developed convective banding and a broad circulation. A broad area of low pressure formed within the wave the next day while located 260mi (420km) southeast of the Cape Verde islands. Though convection decreased early on August 21, the area of low pressure remained well-organized and the system developed into Tropical Depression Four late on August 21. Water temperatures remained warm enough for development, while upper level shear was minimal as the depression moved west-northwestward due to a ridge of high pressure to its north. Initial predictions by the National Hurricane Center also forecast a motion to the northwest based on consistent <b>model</b> <b>predictions,</b> though, as quoted by forecaster James Franklin, [...] "The models have also been excellently wrong thus far".|$|E

2500|$|The {{relative}} {{certainty of}} the measurements and current state estimate {{is an important}} consideration, and {{it is common to}} [...] discuss the response of the filter in terms of the Kalman filter's gain. The Kalman gain is the relative weight given to the measurements and current state estimate, and can be [...] "tuned" [...] to achieve particular performance. With a high gain, the filter places more weight on the most recent measurements, and thus follows them more responsively. With a low gain, the filter follows the <b>model</b> <b>predictions</b> more closely. At the extremes, a high gain close to one will result in a more jumpy estimated trajectory, while low gain close to zero will smooth out noise but decrease the responsiveness.|$|E

40|$|The SWAT {{model was}} tested to {{simulate}} the streamflow of two small Mediterranean catchments (the Vène and the Pallas) in southern France. <b>Model</b> calibration and <b>prediction</b> uncertainty were assessed simultaneously by using three different techniques (SUFI- 2, GLUE and ParaSol). Initially, a sensitivity analysis was conducted using the LH-OAT method. Subsequent sensitive parameter calibration and SWAT prediction uncertainty were analysed by considering, firstly, deterministic discharge data (assuming no uncertainty in discharge data) and secondly, uncertainty in discharge data {{through the development of}} a methodology that accounts explicitly for error in the rating curve (the stage−discharge relationship). To efficiently compare the different uncertainty methods and the effect of the uncertainty of the rating curve on <b>model</b> <b>prediction</b> uncertainty, common criteria were set for the likelihood function, the threshold value and the number of simulations. The results show that <b>model</b> <b>prediction</b> uncertainty is not only case-study specific, but also depends on the selected uncertainty analysis technique.
