5|$|Of the 127 {{bird species}} found along the Merced River, only 35 occur {{along the entire}} length of the river. Many of these birds are migratory and only pass the area a few times every year, while 109 species of birds are found only in the {{breeding}} season. Birds are more abundant along the slow-moving lower river, which has more suitable riparian habitat compared to the rocky, swift upper river. Common species of bird throughout the basin include ruby-crowned kinglet, cedar waxwing, American robin, yellow-rumped warbler, tree swallow and European starling, and several endangered species, including white-tailed kite and Swainson's hawk. Birds that occur commonly in the middle and upper sections of the Merced River include mourning dove, Cassin's finch, California quail, dark-eyed junco, woodpecker, dipper, great blue heron, scrub jay, red-winged blackbird, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, cliff swallow, canyon wren, merganser, and bald eagles. Common insects found along the river include mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies. The river is impacted by invasive Asiatic clam, Chinese <b>mitten</b> <b>crab,</b> and New Zealand mud snail.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of crustaceans are aquatic, living in either marine or freshwater environments, {{but a few}} groups have adapted to life on land, such as terrestrial crabs, terrestrial hermit crabs, and woodlice. Marine crustaceans are as ubiquitous in the oceans as insects are on land. The {{majority of}} crustaceans are also motile, moving about independently, although a few taxonomic units are parasitic and live attached to their hosts (including sea lice, fish lice, whale lice, tongue worms, and Cymothoa exigua, all {{of which may be}} referred to as [...] "crustacean lice"), and adult barnacles live a sessile life – they are attached headfirst to the substrate and cannot move independently. Some branchiurans are able to withstand rapid changes of salinity and will also switch hosts from marine to non-marine species. Krill are the bottom layer and {{the most important part of}} the food chain in Antarctic animal communities.

50|$|Encroachment {{of humans}} into {{previously}} remote ecosystems has exposed exotic {{diseases such as}} HIV to the wider population. Introduced birds (e.g. pigeons), rodents and insects (e.g. mosquito, flea, louse and tsetse fly pests) can serve as vectors and reservoirs of human afflictions. The introduced Chinese <b>mitten</b> <b>crabs</b> are carriers of Asian lung fluke. Throughout recorded history, epidemics of human diseases, such as malaria, yellow fever, typhus, and bubonic plague, spread via these vectors. A recent example of an introduced disease is {{the spread of the}} West Nile virus, which killed humans, birds, mammals, and reptiles. Waterborne disease agents, such as cholera bacteria (Vibrio cholerae), and causative agents of harmful algal blooms are often transported via ballast water. Invasive species and accompanying control efforts can have long term public health implications. For instance, pesticides applied to treat a particular pest species could pollute soil and surface water.|$|R
50|$|This {{species has}} been spread rapidly from Asia (China and Korea) to North America and Europe, raising {{concerns}} that it competes with local species, and its burrowing nature damages embankments and clogs drainage systems. The crabs can make significant inland migrations. It {{was reported in}} 1995 that residents of Greenwich saw Chinese <b>mitten</b> <b>crabs</b> {{coming out of the}} River Thames, and in 2014 one was found in the Clyde, in Scotland. The crabs have also been known to take up residence in swimming pools. In some places the crabs have been found hundreds of miles from the sea. There is concern in areas with a substantial native crab fishery, such as the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and the Hudson River in New York (both locations where the crabs were first spotted in 2005), as the impact of the invasion by this species on the native population is unknown.|$|R
50|$|The Chinese <b>mitten</b> <b>crab</b> also poses many {{threats to}} humans. First, they {{can damage the}} nets of {{commercial}} fisheries and clog water pipes.

5000|$|The {{first time}} the crab was brought to Europe was most likely by {{commercial}} vessels. Ships must fill their ballast water tanks and during one of these filling events, {{it could have been}} the spawning time for the <b>mitten</b> <b>crab.</b> Since the larvae are free floating and 1.7mm to 5mm in size, it would have been easy for them to be swept into the ballast water tank. Once the ship reached Europe and emptied its tank, the crab larvae was released. Over time, this repetition would allow for a prominent <b>mitten</b> <b>crab</b> population in Europe. The crab has spread and can be found in Continental Europe, Southern France, United States of America (the San Francisco Bay), and the United Kingdom. A 15-year period in Germany when the crabs were gradually entering Europe is known as the “establishment phase.” ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Seventeen {{females of}} the mud crab Scylla serrata, from the State of Kosrae, Micronesia, were transported to the Fisheries Resources Research Institute, Gyeongsangnam-do, in oxygen-filled plastic bags. After {{acclimatization}} to a 30 o C holding temperature, nine females were selected for seed production trials. Spawning was hastened using eyestalk ablations; however, {{this may not be}} required in commercial-scale mud crab seed production. Primary spawning produced an average of 2. 4 million hatched larvae, whereas secondary spawning produced 0. 4 million. About 10 days elapsed between spawning and hatching and 30 days between hatching and crablet. Mass mortalities up to 90 % were observed between stages zoea 1 and zoea 2 in every trial. The highest survival rate from zoea 1 to crablet was estimated at 0. 25 %. Most commercial shrimp hatcheries in Korea are equipped with almost all necessary facilities and could be con-verted easily to mud crab hatcheries, able to run three to four times per year using hatchery technologies developed for blue <b>crabs</b> and Chinese <b>mitten</b> <b>crabs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Freeze drying is {{reported}} to be the best method of dehydration. Live fresh Chinese <b>mitten</b> <b>crabs</b> (Eriocheir sinensis) were freeze dried. The moisture content, rehydration ratio, and fatty acid composition of freeze-dried crabs were analysed. The applicability of using freeze drying to process high-value E. sinensis, so as to prolong the time duration of their storage and marketing, were discussed. After lyophilisation, the average moisture content was 6 %. The physical properties (shape, size, and colour) of the musculature and viscera were maintained well during freeze drying. The rehydration ratio was 2. 15 when rehydrated for 30 min at room temperature. The levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, were higher in female freeze-dried crabs than in male crabs. After full rehydration, the fatty acid composition of freeze-dried crabs showed no significant differences to that of frozen crabs after thawing. In conclusion, freeze drying can well preserve the physical properties of the edible parts and fatty acid composition of the viscera in high-value E. sinensis. Rehydration has no destruction of the nutritional value regarding to the fatty acid composition. Therefore, freeze drying is a suitable technique for the processing of high-value E. sinensis...|$|R
