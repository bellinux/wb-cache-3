5|$|Sheep {{were among}} the first animals to be domesticated by {{humankind}} (although the domestication of dogs may be over 20,000 years earlier); the domestication date is estimated to fall between 11,000 and 9,000 B.C in Mesopotamia. Their wild relatives have several characteristics, such as a relative lack of aggression, a <b>manageable</b> <b>size,</b> early sexual maturity, a social nature, and high reproduction rates, which made them particularly suitable for domestication. Today, Ovis aries is an entirely domesticated animal that is largely dependent on humans for its health and survival. Feral sheep do exist, but exclusively in areas devoid of large predators (usually islands) and not on the scale of feral horses, goats, pigs, or dogs, although some feral populations have remained isolated long enough to be recognized as distinct breeds.|$|E

25|$|In 1878, Edison {{began working}} on a system of {{electrical}} illumination, something he hoped could compete with gas and oil based lighting. He began by tackling the problem of creating a long-lasting incandescent lamp, {{something that would be}} needed for indoor use. Many earlier inventors had previously devised incandescent lamps, including Alessandro Volta's demonstration of a glowing wire in 1800 and inventions by Henry Woodward and Mathew Evans. Others who developed early and commercially impractical incandescent electric lamps included Humphry Davy, James Bowman Lindsay, Moses G. Farmer, William E. Sawyer, Joseph Swan, and Heinrich Göbel. Some of these early bulbs had such flaws as an extremely short life, high expense to produce, and high electric current drawn, making them difficult to apply on a large scale commercially. Edison realized that to connect a series of electric lights to an economically <b>manageable</b> <b>size</b> and using the necessary thickness of copper wire, he would have to develop a lamp that used a low amount of current. This lamp must have high resistance and use relatively low voltage (around 110 volts).|$|E

2500|$|When the DFT is {{used for}} signal {{spectral}} analysis, the [...] sequence usually represents a finite set of uniformly spaced time-samples of some signal , where t represents time. [...] The conversion from continuous time to samples (discrete-time) changes the underlying Fourier transform of x(t) into a discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT), which generally entails a type of distortion called aliasing. [...] Choice of an appropriate sample-rate (see Nyquist rate) {{is the key to}} minimizing that distortion. [...] Similarly, the conversion from a very long (or infinite) sequence to a <b>manageable</b> <b>size</b> entails a type of distortion called leakage, which is manifested as a loss of detail (a.k.a. resolution) in the DTFT. [...] Choice of an appropriate sub-sequence length is the primary key to minimizing that effect. [...] When the available data (and time to process it) is more than the amount needed to attain the desired frequency resolution, a standard technique is to perform multiple DFTs, for example to create a spectrogram. [...] If the desired result is a power spectrum and noise or randomness is present in the data, averaging the magnitude components of the multiple DFTs is a useful procedure to reduce the variance of the spectrum (also called a periodogram in this context); two examples of such techniques are the Welch method and the Bartlett method; the general subject of estimating the power spectrum of a noisy signal is called spectral estimation.|$|E

60|$|We have {{at first}} some {{difficulty}} in realising how he police could know {{the contents of}} an obscure author's desk. For one {{thing we have to}} remember that Paris, though it had been enormously increased in the days of Law and the System (1719-20), was still of a comparatively <b>manageable</b> <b>size.</b> In 1720, though the population of the whole realm was only fourteen or fifteen millions, that of Paris had reached no less a figure than a million and a half. After the explosion of the System, its artificial expansion naturally came to an end. By the middle of the century the highest estimate of the population does not make it much more than eight hundred thousand.[44] This, unlike the socially unwholesome and monstrous agglomerations of Paris or London in our own time, was a population over which police supervision might be made tolerably effective. It was more like a very large provincial town. Again, the inhabitants were marked off into groups or worlds with a definiteness that is now no longer possible. One-fifth of the population, for instance, consisted of domestic servants.[45] There were between twenty-eight and thirty thousand professional beggars.[46] The legal circle was large, and was deeply engrossed by its own interests and troubles. The world of authorship, though extremely noisy and profoundly important, still made only a small group. One effect of a censorship is to produce much gossip and whispering about suspected productions before they see the light, and these whispers let the police into as many secrets as they choose to know.|$|E

Compression schemes fall into two basic types, lossless and lossy. Lossless compression enables all of the data contained in the original to be reproduced.

Lossy compression schemes gained great popularity due to their ability to produce smaller files compared to lossless compression. One way of comparing the effects of image compression algorithms is to look at changes in their histograms and statistical parameters such as mean, standard deviation and median values.
