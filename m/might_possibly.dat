5|$|The {{fossil record}} for bees is {{incomplete}} with around 11 specimens that <b>might</b> <b>possibly</b> be Bombini, some poorly documented, had {{been described by}} 2011; some (such as Calyptapis florissantensis from Florissant, USA, and Oligoapis beskonakensis from , Turkey) dated from the Oligocene. In 2012 a fossil bumblebee, Bombus (Bombus) randeckensis was described from the Miocene Randeck Maar in southwestern Germany and confidently placed in the subgenus Bombus.|$|E
5|$|Antiemetic {{medications}} may {{be helpful}} for treating vomiting in children. Ondansetron has some utility, with a single dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting. Metoclopramide might also be helpful. However, the use of ondansetron <b>might</b> <b>possibly</b> be linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children. The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants. Dimenhydrinate, while reducing vomiting, {{does not appear to}} have a significant clinical benefit.|$|E
5|$|Freyja {{receives}} the slain {{heroes of the}} battlefield quite respectfully as Óðinn does. Her house is called Sessrumnir, 'filled with many seats', and it probably fills the same function as Valhöll, 'the hall of the slain', where the warriors eat and drink beer after the fighting. Still, we must ask why there are two heroic paradises in the Old Norse View of afterlife. It <b>might</b> <b>possibly</b> be a consequence of different forms of initiation of warriors, where one part seemed to have belonged to Óðinn {{and the other to}} Freyja. These examples indicate that Freyja was a war-goddess, and she even appears as a valkyrie, literally 'the one who chooses the slain'.|$|E

5|$|The actual Burnt Norton is a manor {{located near}} the village of Aston Subedge in Gloucestershire that Eliot visited with Emily Hale during 1934. The {{original}} Norton House was a mansion burned down in 1741 by its owner, Sir William Keyt, who died in the fire. Even though Eliot was married, {{he spent a lot of}} time with Hale and <b>might</b> <b>possibly</b> have become involved with her had he not been married. Even after their time at Burnt Norton, Eliot stayed in close correspondence with her and sent her many of his poems. The actual manor does not serve as an important location within the poem. Instead, it is the garden surrounding the manor that became the focus.|$|E
5|$|Beauchamp {{probably}} {{held the}} office of royal forester for Worcestershire as well as sheriff. The evidence {{for this is that}} after Beauchamp's death, his son William was granted the revenues from the royal forests of Worcestershire {{at the same rate as}} his father had held them; this strongly implies that the elder held {{the office of}} forester. The historian Judith Green felt that Walter de Beauchamp <b>might</b> <b>possibly</b> have held the office of constable, which had been held by his father-in-law, although the historian C. Warren Hollister felt that Beauchamp definitely did hold the office. He also a held the royal office of dispenser, an office which later became known as a butler. He acquired this because his wife inherited the office from her father. The date when he acquired the office is unknown. While a member of the royal household, Beauchamp witnessed a number of royal charters, mainly when the king was in England.|$|E
25|$|Due to some {{confusion}} in translation, {{his name is}} variously written as Arniko or Araniko in old texts. A mistake made by Baburam Acharya ascribed his Sanskrit name as Balabahu. However, later he contends that Aniko <b>might</b> <b>possibly</b> be the Chinese pronunciation for Sanskrit name Aneka.|$|E

50|$|According to David Simone, the {{managing}} director of Phonogram Records at the time, the album <b>might</b> have <b>possibly</b> been the most expensive record made in the U.K. According to guitarist Phil Collen, the album had to sell a minimum of 5 million copies to break even.|$|R
25|$|In 2009, Iohannis had {{stated that}} he <b>might</b> <b>possibly</b> run {{for the office of}} President of Romania, {{although}} not in 2009.

25|$|The stern was {{abandoned}} {{in favour of}} the bow as what had already been uncovered suggested that parallels <b>might</b> <b>possibly</b> be made between the Madrague de Giens wreck and classical iconography and the archaeologists wished to explore this further. With the bow uncovered {{it was clear that}} the shape and proportions of the ship were indeed similar to images created at the time of its wrecking, particularly that of the Ocean God mosaic in the Themetra baths in Tunisia.|$|E
25|$|Bakhit {{stated that}} {{opposition}} groups, both Islamist and leftists, <b>might</b> <b>possibly</b> {{be included in}} the new government, but the Islamic Action Front immediately rejected that offer, stating that the current political conditions did not allow for them to join the government and that they were looking for real reform. Despite calls {{to stay away from the}} new government, the Islamic Action Front and five leftists were represented in a new government sworn in on 10 February.|$|E

50|$|With {{the death}} of Saparmurat Niyazov on December 21, 2006, some thought the {{situation}} <b>might</b> change, <b>possibly</b> opening {{for the expansion of}} multiple parties within the nation, but such hopes did not materialize, as Niyazov's successor Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow made no substantial changes to the country's system, with the DPT remaining the only legal party and only Niyazov's cult of personality being reduced.|$|R
25|$|The besieging army redoubled {{their efforts}} and soon {{rendered}} the fort untenable. In their hour of supreme peril they remembered the old Maharani Kishori, who had outlived {{the glory of}} house of Bharatpur, and been pining in neglect and retirement {{after the death of}} Maharaja Jawahar Singh. Ranjit Singh's well-wishers advised him to send the old Rani Kishori to the Mughal camp, because she enjoyed the respect and good-will of the high officers of Amir-ul-umra and <b>might</b> <b>possibly</b> by her intercession procure pardon for his past offenses.|$|E
25|$|Finally, Dàoxuān {{provides}} information concerning Bodhidharma's death. Bodhidharma, he writes, {{died at the}} banks of the Luo River, where he was interred by his disciple Dazu Huike, possibly in a cave. According to Dàoxuān's chronology, Bodhidharma's death must have occurred prior to 534, the date of the Northern Wei's fall, because Dazu Huike subsequently leaves Luoyang for Ye. Furthermore, citing the shore of the Luo River as the place of death <b>might</b> <b>possibly</b> suggest that Bodhidharma died in the mass executions at Heyin (河陰) in 528. Supporting this possibility is a report in the Chinese Buddhist canon stating that a Buddhist monk was among the victims at Héyīn.|$|E
25|$|Pandemic was {{aided by}} Weta Digital in {{developing}} the game. They provided many of their digital models, including the fell beasts. Pandemic also used elements that were cut from the films, and have taken inspiration from J. R. R. Tolkien's original fantasy series, such as a level based loosely around Balin's conquest of Moria, in which Gimli attempts to retake the dwarven city from the orcs. Some inspiration was less direct: the armies of Rohan and Gondor decide not to attack Minas Morgul in the novel, but a level in the game is based on what <b>might</b> <b>possibly</b> have happened if they had. The game uses Howard Shore's score to the films as its soundtrack.|$|E
6000|$|... [42] A curious result <b>might</b> very <b>possibly</b> {{follow a}} success of {{submarines}} {{on the part}} of a naval power finally found to be weaker and defeated.

25|$|The Shah's army, {{numbering}} {{anywhere from}} 40,000 to 200,000 (mostly city garrisons), was split {{among the various}} major cities, bar an elite unit of cavalry stationed near Samarkand as a reserve force. The empire had just recently conquered much of its territory, and the Shah was fearful that his army, if placed in one large unit under a single command structure, <b>might</b> <b>possibly</b> be turned against him. Furthermore, the Shah's reports from China indicated that the Mongols were not experts in siege warfare, and experienced problems when attempting to take fortified positions. The Shah's decisions on troop deployment would prove disastrous as the campaign unfolded, as the Mongol speed, surprise, and enduring initiative prevented the Shah from effectively maneuvering his forces.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, he {{returned}} to Bavaria, to the University of Regensburg and co-founded the theological journal Communio, with Hans Urs von Balthasar, Henri de Lubac, Walter Kasper and others, in 1972. Communio, now published in seventeen languages, including German, English and Spanish, has become a prominent journal of contemporary Catholic theological thought. Until his election as pope, he remained one of the journal's most prolific contributors. In 1976, he suggested that the Augsburg Confession <b>might</b> <b>possibly</b> be recognised as a Catholic statement of faith. Several of Benedict's former students became his confidantes, notably Christoph Schönborn, {{and a number of}} his former students sometimes meet for discussions. He served as Vice President of the University of Regensburg from 1976 to 1977.|$|E
25|$|Geoffrey {{mentions}} {{a similar}} tale just before that episode, however, {{which may be}} an unintentional duplication. Just after the Romans leave, the archbishop of London is put forward by the representatives of Britain to organise the island's defences. To do so, he arranges for continental soldiers to come to Britain. The name of the bishop is Guitelin, a name similar to the Vitalinus mentioned in the ancestry of Vortigern and to the Vitalinus said to have fought with Ambrosius at the Battle of Guoloph. This Guithelin/Vitalinus disappears from the story as soon as Vortigern arrives. All these coincidences imply that Geoffrey duplicated {{the story of the}} invitation of the Saxons, and that the tale of Guithelinus the archbishop <b>might</b> <b>possibly</b> give some insight into the background of Vortigern before his acquisition of power.|$|E

25|$|Provide an {{algorithm}} that secures a win for one player, or a {{draw for}} either, against any possible moves by the opponent, {{from the beginning}} of the game. That is, produce at least one complete ideal game (all moves start to end) with proof that each move is optimal for the player making it. It does not necessarily mean a computer program using the solution will play optimally against an imperfect opponent. For example, the checkers program Chinook will never turn a drawn position into a losing position (since the weak solution of checkers proves that it is a draw), but it <b>might</b> <b>possibly</b> turn a winning position into a drawn position because Chinook does not expect the opponent to play a move that will not win but could possibly lose, and so it does not analyze such moves completely.|$|E
25|$|A {{portion of}} his Disputationes adversus astrologiam divinatricem was {{published}} in Bologna after his death. In this book Pico presents arguments against the practice of astrology that have had enormous resonance for centuries, up to our own time. Disputationes {{is influenced by the}} arguments against astrology espoused by one of his intellectual heroes, St. Augustine of Hippo, and also by the medieval philosophical tale Hayy Ibn-Yaqzan which promoted autodidacticism as a philosophical program. Pico's antagonism to astrology seems to derive mainly from the conflict of astrology with Christian notions of free will. But Pico's arguments moved beyond the objections of Ficino, who was himself an astrologer. The manuscript was edited for publication after Pico's death by his nephew Giovanni Francesco Pico della Mirandola, an ardent follower of Savonarola, and may possibly have been amended to be more forcefully critical. This <b>might</b> <b>possibly</b> explain the fact that Ficino championed the manuscript and enthusiastically endorsed it before its publication.|$|E
25|$|The {{circumstances}} {{behind the}} war were complicated {{as was the}} final settlement. In going to war in 1919 against British India, Amir Amanullah's war aims were complicated. Even up against a depleted British Indian Army, a tactical victory was unlikely; however, the war served the dual purpose of deflecting domestic criticism and also offering the opportunity for strategic political gains. As {{a result of the}} peace treaty that was negotiated, the British ceased payment of the Afghan subsidy, and thus ended their claim to direct Afghan foreign policy, which had been the pro quid quo of the Emir accepting the subsidy. The British had traditionally wanted Afghanistan as a buffer state between India and the Russian Empire. In 1919, the Russian Civil War was raging and any threat from Russia to India at the time was potential rather than real. Moreover, the British were by far the largest supporters of the White movement in the Russian Civil War with the British contributing more arms to the Whites than all of the other nations supporting the Whites did combined. It was assumed in London that if the Whites won the Civil War, a new era in Anglo-Russian relations <b>might</b> <b>possibly</b> open as the victorious Whites might be grateful for British support, rendering the need for a buffer state in Central Asia irrelevant. The British also stopped arms sales from India to Afghanistan. But, as British influence declined, the Afghans were able to gain control of their own foreign affairs and in the aftermath emerged as a fully independent state. The British also made some political gains, most notably the reaffirmation of the Durand Line – which had long been a contentious issue between the two nations – as the political boundary separating Afghanistan from the North-West Frontier, and the undertaking that the Afghans made to stop interference on the British side of the line.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reasons given}} for Akha relocations vary, but a common {{response}} {{on the part}} of the Thai government is to cite a concern for the preservation of forests and the promotion of more sustainable agricultural techniques than the slash and burn agriculture traditionally used by the Akha.
