25|$|The {{physical}} examination {{of an individual}} with aortic insufficiency involves auscultation of the heart to listen for the <b>murmur</b> <b>of</b> aortic insufficiency and the S3 heart sound (S3 gallop correlates with development of LV dysfunction). The <b>murmur</b> <b>of</b> chronic aortic insufficiency is typically described as early diastolic and decrescendo, which is best heard in the third left intercostal space and may radiate along the left sternal border.|$|E
25|$|Aortic {{insufficiency}} (AI) {{occurs in}} half to two-thirds of ascending aortic dissections, and the <b>murmur</b> <b>of</b> aortic insufficiency is audible in about 32% of proximal dissections.

25|$|At Match day 3 Anorthosis went to Tasos Markou to {{play against}} Enosis Paralimni on September 17. Anorthosis players {{found their way to}} the nets on the 69th minute with the goal of Bojan Markovski after a smart kickoff of Marko Andić from the left side. Players of Anorthosis lost many {{opportunities}} to score another goal after the red card which Kiassos received. In the final stages of the match threatened to take up the equalizer causing the <b>murmur</b> <b>of</b> the fans and complaints about the fairness of the victory of the opposing side.|$|E
25|$|The communists' {{selective}} permissiveness took {{a toll on}} Aderca's legacy. During the 1950s, {{only his}} biography of Christopher Columbus was available in bookstores, with younger readers seemingly convinced that Aderca was a one-book author. After his death, other works were published individually or collectively: Murmurul cuvintelor ("The <b>Murmur</b> <b>of</b> Words", collected poems, 1971), Răzvrătirea lui Prometeu ("Prometheus' Rebellion", 1974), Teatru ("Drama", 1974), Contribuții critice ("Contributions to Criticism", 1983 and 1988), Oameni și idei ("Men and Ideas", 1983). In 1966, Orașele înecate was reprinted as Orașe scufundate, following Aderca's own command. Translated into German, it became somewhat familiar to an international public.|$|E
2500|$|Luís de Camões (1524–1580) {{referred}} to the mountains of Sintra in his Os Lusíadas chronicle, as a mythic land ruled by water nymphs. The Renaissance poet Luisa Sigea—Syntrae Aloisiae Sygeae in Paris (1566) and Madrid (1781) {{referred to}} Sintra as a [...] "pleasant valley, between cliffs that rise into the heavens...curved in graceful hills among which one can feel the <b>murmur</b> <b>of</b> the waters... everything, in fact, will enchant and perfume the environment with its fragrance and fruit." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 27 September 1383 Leonor {{gave birth}} to a {{daughter}} who lived only a few days; as in the previous case, it was also rumored that, due to King Ferdinand's long illness, he was not the infant's father. One month later, on 22 October, the Portuguese monarch died, either of tuberculosis or of gradual poisoning. Leonor did not attend the funeral, according to the chronicler Fernão Lopes, [...] "saying that she felt ill, and could not be there", because of her recent childbirth, or according to other commentators, [...] "fearing the <b>murmur</b> <b>of</b> the people." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{are facing}} the most {{powerful}} group in the country ... The best parameter to measure this presentation {{is that it was}} short, it seemed to have lasted ten minutes or so and people were left wanting more. The outpouring of the stadium was a general <b>murmur</b> <b>of</b> the songs from Soda Stereo. The rain, the traffic on Avenida del Libertador was cluttered by those entering and leaving. The last hot dog of the night and a healthy sense of well being, leave no room for existential questions. I then put my jaw back in place and went singing softly [...] "Estoy Azulado" [...] between the rain on Libertador. [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|Lopez {{has been}} {{influenced}} by artists such as Tina Turner, James Brown, Michael Jackson, Madonna and Barbra Streisand. She credited Rita Moreno's performance in the 1961 musical film West Side Story as a major inspiration. Critics have considered Lopez's voice to be limited, and obscured by the production of her music, while remaining [...] "radio-friendly". Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone observed: [...] "Instead of strained vocal pyrotechnics, Lopez sticks to the understated R <b>murmur</b> <b>of</b> a round-the-way superstar who doesn't need to belt because she knows you're already paying attention [...] She makes a little va-va {{and a whole lot}} of voom go a long way." [...] Meanwhile, AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine called her voice [...] "slight" [...] and wrote: [...] "Lopez was never, ever about singing; she was about style". Entertainment Weekly criticized her vocal performance for lacking the trademark [...] "husky-voiced voluptuousness" [...] she has in her films. The Baltimore Sun regards Lopez as having a [...] "breathy" [...] stylistic range, but lacking personality.|$|E

2500|$|Richard L. Allen, Putnam's grand son-in-law, opined in An Analysis of the Principal Mineral Fountains at Saratoga Springs, [...] "It was to Putnam {{that we are}} indebted, {{more than}} to any other {{individual}} for improvements at the Springs, {{during this period of}} its history. His enterprise and energy cleared away the forest trees from the adjacent plains, converted the rich pineries into materials and means for the further development of the town, erected public buildings for the accommodation of visitors, opened highways about the town, improved and laid out streets in the village; excavated, tubed and secured the mineral springs.... He was emphatically the man of his day in this locality, and he made such an impression on the place of his choice, that his name must be co-existent with the history of the village which his energy did so much to develop. He possessed a will which no ordinary obstacle could long withstand, and by his exertions the din and hum of civilization soon took the place of the deep and solemn <b>murmur</b> <b>of</b> the primitive pine forest." ...|$|E
2500|$|... a {{congregation}} consisting of 10,000 souls, streaming into the hall, mounting the galleries, humming, buzzing, and swarming– a mighty hive of bees– eager to secure {{at first the}} best places, and, at last, any place at all. After waiting {{more than half an}} hour– for if you wish to have a seat you must be there at least that space of time in advance... Mr. Spurgeon ascended his tribune. To the hum, and rush, and trampling of men, succeeded a low, concentrated thrill and <b>murmur</b> <b>of</b> devotion, which seemed to run at once, like an electric current, through the breast of everyone present, and by this magnetic chain the preacher held us fast bound for about two hours. It is not my purpose to give a summary of his discourse. It is enough to say of his voice, that its power and volume are sufficient to reach every one in that vast assembly; of his language that it is neither high-flown nor homely; of his style, that it is at times familiar, at times declamatory, but always happy, and often eloquent; of his doctrine, that neither the 'Calvinist' nor the 'Baptist' appears in the forefront of the battle which is waged by Mr. Spurgeon with relentless animosity, and with Gospel weapons, against irreligion, cant, hypocrisy, pride, and those secret bosom-sins which so easily beset a man in daily life; and to sum up all in a word, it is enough to say, of the man himself, that he impresses you with a perfect conviction of his sincerity.|$|E
2500|$|Indeed, a visibly shaken Ceaușescu gave a halting 5-hour (other {{sources say}} 7-hour) speech that was soon {{interrupted}} by boos. Beginning in a trembling voice, {{he made an}} initial, hopeless attempt to send the miners back to work: “Comrades, {{this is not the}} war… this is a disgrace for the entire nation… a disgrace! I have taken note of your grievances.” He tried to explain the party's policy and appeal to the miners through demagogy, claiming that the party leadership had wanted to reduce working hours but that the miners had resisted, which insult to their intelligence was met by cries of “It is not us! Bandits, thieves!” A general <b>murmur</b> <b>of</b> the crowd ran through the speech, along with protests and outbursts of anger; whenever Ceaușescu began to stumble over his words, some of the men booed and whistled. Proposing that the six-hour day be introduced gradually at Lupeni and then at the other mines, the men replied, “A six-hour day from tomorrow.” Toward the end, when, angered by their audacity, he still refused to grant an immediate six-hour workday, phrases loudly heckled included [...] "He has no idea what the people's interests are" [...] and [...] "He is not concerned with the workers' fundamental interests". Starting to threaten them, Ceaușescu warned that “If you do not go back to work we'll have to stop pussyfooting around!” According to observers, [...] "Down with Ceaușescu!" [...] was then heard after prolonged booing, an account confirmed by Verdeț. Refusing to grasp what was taking place [...] a break between Party and workers on a scale unprecedented in Communist Romania , he was both shocked by his inability to connect with the workers and frightened for his physical safety (once in the workers' midst, there was little chance for law enforcement to protect him). Only when Dobre seized the microphone and urged the miners to let Ceaușescu finish did the atmosphere become less charged. At that point he saw that his only exit lay in making conciliatory promises {{he had no intention of}} honouring; using the wooden language that miners trust, he promised to resolve their grievances (agreeing to a six-hour workday for everyone, with Saturdays and Sundays off, and to build factories that would provide jobs for miners' wives and daughters), vowed those responsible for the miners' discontent would be brought to account and that there would be no retribution, and was applauded. [...] "Calm down and go back to work", he said, after which, exhausted by the speech and the tension which made him feel insecure, he felt physically weak when leaving the platform, having to lean on one of his men. Verdeț and Pană were released and the strike came to an end immediately after Ceaușescu's departure, the men dispersing and some going into the mines for the August 3 evening shift. They even offered to make up the time lost during the strike.|$|E
