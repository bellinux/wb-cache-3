5000|$|Laboratory {{testing of}} {{substances}} {{to see if}} they inhibited sperm motility began in the 1800s. Modern spermicides nonoxynol-9 and <b>menfegol</b> were developed from this line of research. However, many other substances of dubious contraceptive value were also promoted. Especially after the prohibition of contraception in the U.S. by the 1873 Comstock Act, spermicides—the most popular of which was Lysol—were marketed only as [...] "feminine hygiene" [...] products and were not held to any standard of effectiveness. Worse, many manufacturers recommended using the products as a douche after intercourse, too late to affect all the sperm. Medical estimates during the 1930s placed the pregnancy rate of women using many over-the-counter spermicides at seventy percent per year.|$|E
50|$|Nonoxynol-9 is {{the primary}} {{chemical}} in spermicides to inhibit sperm motility. Active secondary spermicidal ingredients can include octoxynol-9, benzalkonium chloride and <b>menfegol.</b> These secondary ingredients aren't mainstream in the United States, being the only active ingredient adopted the one cited above. Preventing sperm motility will inhibit the sperm from travelling towards the egg moving down the fallopian tubes to the uterus. In fact the deep proper insertion of spermicide should effectively block the cervix so that sperm cannot make it past the cervix, to the uterus, or the fallopian tubes. Scholars K.T. Bartman and et al. study observing the distribution of spermicide containing Nonoxynol-9 in the vaginal tract, showed “After 10 min the gel spread within the vaginal canal providing a contiguous covering of the epithelium of variable thickness.” The sole goal of spermicide is to prevent fertilization.|$|E
40|$|<b>Menfegol</b> is a {{spermicide}} with {{in vitro}} activity against {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV). A randomized placebo-controlled safety study covered the use of <b>menfegol</b> foaming tablets for 14 days at increasing frequencies of insertion by 125 prostitutes in Dakar, Senegal. The frequencies of colposcopically diagnosed genital lesions were 5. 0 %, 11. 8 %, 27. 8 %, 49. 7 %, and 29. 4 % among <b>menfegol</b> recipients when tablets were used once every other day or 1, 2, 4, or 8 times a day, respectively (P <. 05). Among placebo recipients, frequencies were 11. 1 % and 23. 5 % when tablets were used < 8 times daily and 8 times daily, respectively. There was no association be-tween subjective genital symptoms and the incidence of colposcopically detected lesions. The high incidence of genital lesions when <b>menfegol</b> foaming tablets were used more than once daily suggests that their frequent use should not be recommended to prevent HIV transmission. In use at low frequency, the tablets ' toxicity might bebalanced by anti-HIV properties. Safety studies on vaginal microbicides should use objective methods, such as colposcopy, to assess the incidence of lesions. Currently, the only readily available device to decrease the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) an...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a {{prevalent}} vaginal {{infection that}} is now regarded as a risk factor in more serious pelvic and obstetric complications. Spermicides {{are known to have}} antimicrobial activity against other sexually transmitted diseases and the aim {{of this study was to}} test whether the causative organisms of BV were also susceptible to spermicides, in vitro. DESIGN [...] Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations of five spermicidal compounds were determined for the organisms associated with BV, in an agar dilution technique. LOCATION [...] The Department of Experimental and Clinical Microbiology, University of Sheffield Medical School, UK. SPERMICIDES AND ORGANISMS [...] Nonoxynol- 9, Nonoxynol- 11, Docusate sodium, Benzalkonium chloride and <b>Menfegol</b> were tested against 20 strains each of Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides and Mobiluncus organisms, isolated from patients with BV who attended the Department of Genitourinary Medicine, the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] The susceptibility of BV-associated organisms to spermicidal compounds, in vitro. RESULTS [...] G vaginalis, Mobiluncus spp, Bacteroides bivius and Bacteroides disiens were all susceptible to the five spermicides tested, with MICs ranging between less than or equal to 19 and 5000 mg/l (0. 0019 %- 0. 5 %). CONCLUSION [...] The concentrations of spermicides incorporated in contraceptive preparations are usually between 3 % and 8 %, which are far in excess of the MICs found for BV organisms. Their usage could exert a significant antimicrobial effect and be a useful prophylactic in preventing the infection...|$|E
