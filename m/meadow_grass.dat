60|$|When he {{was almost}} to the old butter-nut tree Johnny Chuck sat up very {{straight}} so that his head came just above the tall <b>meadow</b> <b>grasses</b> beside the Lone Little Path. He could see the Merry Little Breezes dancing and racing under the old butternut tree and having such a good time! And {{he could see the}} long ears of Peter Rabbit standing up straight above the tall <b>meadow</b> <b>grasses.</b> One of the Merry Little Breezes spied Johnny Chuck.|$|R

60|$|When {{they found}} that Danny Meadow Mouse really wasn't going to cry, they stopped teasing and invited him to come play {{with them in the}} long <b>meadow</b> <b>grass.</b> Such a good frolic as they did have!

50|$|The region {{north of}} the {{mountain}}ous region {{on the border with}} Turkey is where poplar, willow, oak, hawthorn, cherry plum, rose hips, mountain apple, pear, Sorbus, and other wild trees and <b>meadow</b> <b>grasses</b> are usually located. The town is 1100 yd long and 550 yd wide. It houses 6,000 citizens in almost 1,200 houses.|$|R
5000|$|The Assyrian {{homeland}} is moderately elevated, {{being around}} 200 m {{at the south}} in the Nineveh plains near Mosul, to around 1900 m in the northern periphery at the highest peaks, just above Zakho.

6000|$|Up {{and down}} the dusty street, [...] I hurry with my burning feet; [...] Against my face the wind-waves beat, [...] Fierce from the city-sea of heat.

60|$|It was a fire! Yes, Sir, {{it was a}} fire in the <b>meadow</b> <b>grass!</b> Some one {{had dropped}} a lighted match, and now little red flames were running through the grass in all directions.

60|$|Early in the spring, {{after the}} ice has melted, {{is the time}} for spearing fish. Suddenly the wind shifts from {{northeast}} and east to west and south, and every icicle, which has tinkled on the <b>meadow</b> <b>grass</b> so long, trickles down its stem, and seeks its level unerringly with a million comrades. The steam curls up from every roof and fence.|$|E
60|$|One bright {{summer day}} Johnny Chuck was {{out looking for}} a good breakfast of nice tender clover. He had wandered quite a long way from his snug little house in the long <b>meadow</b> <b>grass,</b> {{although}} his mother had told him never to go {{out of sight of the}} door. But Johnny was like some little boys I know, and forgot all he had been told.|$|E
60|$|Very {{cautiously}} Reddy Fox crept {{out from}} behind the bush into the tall <b>meadow</b> <b>grass.</b> Flat on his stomach he crawled inch by inch. Every few minutes he stopped to listen and to peep over at the sweet-clover bed. There sat Peter Rabbit, eating, eating, eating the tender young clover as if he hadn't a care in the world but to fill his little round stomach.|$|E

2500|$|The {{grassland}} {{is generally}} dominated by sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina), red fescue (Festuca rubra), and upright brome (Bromus erectus). There are also several varieties of herbs, characteristic to the Wiltshire downland, including for devil's bit scabious (Succisa pratensis), saw-wort (Serratula tinctoria), and chalk milkwort (Polygala calcarea). There are also many other native and site specific plants, including for orchids, <b>meadow</b> <b>grasses,</b> nettles, and other flora. On the steep slopes horseshoe vetch (Hippocrepis comosa), Thymus, and Asperula is plentiful ...|$|R
30|$|One area of Native-based {{ecological}} {{knowledge that}} has been thoroughly explored is that of fire management through controlled burning. Kat Anderson wrote an often cited book-length thesis on these practices among California Indians in her book Tending the Wild. Don Hankin also expands on controlled burning in this volume. Lightfoot and Parish write in their book that burning was a “primary management tool” among California Native peoples (Lightfoot and Parrish 2009). Malcolm Margolin notes that fire management can also fertilize the soil and burn away “overshadow <b>meadow</b> <b>grasses</b> and wildflowers” (Margolin 1981).|$|R
60|$|Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun {{had climbed}} quite {{high in the}} sky when Johnny Chuck awoke. He yawned and {{stretched}} and stretched and yawned, and then he sat up to look over the Green Meadows. Then he became wide awake, very wide awake indeed! Way down on the Green Meadows he caught a glimpse of something red jumping about in the long <b>meadow</b> <b>grass.</b>|$|E

60|$|We {{walked out}} the other evening, with M. Fazy, to a {{beautiful}} place, where Servetus was burned. Soft, new-mown <b>meadow</b> <b>grass</b> carpets it, and a solemn amphitheatre of mountains, glowing in the evening sky, looked down--Mont Blanc, the blue-black Mole, the Saleve! Never was deed done in a more august presence chamber! Ere this these two may have conferred together of the tragedy, with far other thoughts than then.|$|E
60|$|He {{was so busy}} {{wishing that}} he had a long tail that he quite forgot {{to take care of the}} tail he did have, and he pretty nearly lost it and his life with it. Old Whitetail the Marsh Hawk spied Danny sitting there moping on his doorstep, and came sailing over the tops of the <b>meadow</b> <b>grasses</b> so softly that he all but caught Danny. If it hadn't been for one of the Merry Little Breezes, Danny would have been caught. And all because he was envious. It's a bad, bad habit.|$|R
5000|$|The Sub-alpine {{forest and}} {{mountain}} meadow zone extends from 1,200 to 2,300 meters. The most common trees are Siberian pine, larch, and birch. The <b>meadows</b> feature <b>grasses,</b> sedges, and blueberries.|$|R
50|$|Like all equids, kiangs are herbivores, {{feeding on}} grasses and sedges, {{especially}} Stipa, but also including other local {{plants such as}} bog sedges, true sedges, and <b>meadow</b> <b>grasses.</b> When little grass is available, such as during winter or in the more arid margins of their native habitat, they have been observed eating shrubs, herbs, and even Oxytropis roots, dug from the ground. Although they do sometimes drink from waterholes, such sources of water are rare on the Tibetan Plateau, and they likely obtain most of their water from the plants they eat, or possibly from snow in winter.|$|R
