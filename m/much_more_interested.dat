25|$|Davis {{attached}} {{no great}} importance to formal syllabuses and course structures. He was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in the contact between teacher and student, and brought {{in a system of}} fortnightly undergraduate essays which has persisted for a long time. There were fortnightly tutorials and weekly seminars, all supplemented by lectures. Postgraduate research was, surprisingly, not a high priority although he encouraged his younger colleagues in research, and pursued his own research with vigour and distinction.|$|E

25|$|Therefore the {{inevitable}} rhythmic reliability in fastest, asymmetric accented, melodies {{is a special}} trademark of virtuosos. Generalizing: Arabian music is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in rhythmical patterns that are more complex than European ones. Bashir's virtuosity of picking can easily be understood, when he shows his ability to apply the abovementioned scordatura, with its string pairs tuned in octaves, in an improvisation in the fast 10/8 metre, without the immense stopping problems of this method becoming hearable.|$|E
25|$|The Bajío, a rich, fertile lowland {{just north}} of central Mexico, was {{nonetheless}} a frontier region between the densely populated plateaus and valleys of Mexico's center and south and the harsh northern desert controlled by nomadic Chichimeca. Devoid of settled indigenous populations in the early sixteenth century, the Bajío did not initially attract Spaniards, who were <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in exploiting labor and collecting tribute whenever possible. The region did not have indigenous populations that practiced subsistence agriculture. The Bajío developed in the colonial period as a region of commercial agriculture.|$|E
25|$|British Jewish scholar Hyam Maccoby {{contended that}} the Paul as {{described}} in the book of Acts and the view of Paul gleaned from his own writings are very different people. Some difficulties have been noted in the account of his life. Paul {{as described in the}} Book of Acts is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in factual history, less in theology; ideas such as justification by faith are absent as are references to the Spirit, according to Maccoby. He also pointed out that there are no references to John the Baptist in the Pauline Epistles, although Paul mentions him several times in the book of Acts.|$|E

The book was read carefully, but its thesis rejected, by nineteenth century scientists including the geologist Charles Lyell and the comparative anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Darwin acknowledged Lamarck as an important zoologist, and his theory a forerunner of Darwin's evolution by natural selection.|$|R
25|$|Soen Nakagawa {{was born}} as Motoi Nakagawa on March 19, 1907 in Keelung, Taiwan as {{the eldest of}} three boys: Matoi, Tamotsu and Sonow. His father, Suketaro Nakagawa, was an army medical officer and his mother's name was Kazuko. His family moved shortly after to Iwakune, and then finally to Hiroshima. In 1917, at age 12, Nakagawa's father died, leaving his mother Kazuko a young widow. Soen's younger brother, Tamotsu, died soon after in his early childhood. His mother was forced to work {{to make ends meet}} and educate her young {{children}} herself. It was an unforgiving childhood for Soen. Soen's family was of samurai class, so in his youth he was trained as a samurai. But Soen was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in the arts, where at a young age he displayed a gift for poetry.|$|E
25|$|He {{tended to}} dramatize where {{traditional}} novelists narrated; {{he is more}} concerned with the interplay of ideas and opinions than of feelings and emotions; his dramatis personae is more likely to consist of a cast of more or less equal characters than of one outstanding hero or heroine and a host of minor auxiliaries; his novels have a tendency to approximate the Classical unities, with few changes of scene and few if any subplots; his novels are novels of conversation rather than novels of action; in fact, Peacock is so <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in what his characters say to one another than in what they do to one another that he often sets out entire chapters of his novels in dialogue form. Plato's Symposium is the literary ancestor of these works, by way of the Deipnosophists of Athenaeus, in which (as in much of Peacock) the conversation relates less to exalted philosophical themes than to the points of a good fish dinner.|$|E
500|$|By {{the early}} 1660s, {{frustration}} was growing that the colonies were not turning a profit. [...] The Order still owed money to France {{for the initial}} purchase of the islands, and on Malta the knights debated whether they should sell them back. Jean-Baptiste Colbert, <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in colonization than Mazarin, was now in power in King Louis XIV's court, and he applied pressure to the Knights to sell. In 1665, the Knights sold their colony to the newly formed Compagnie des Indes occidentales.|$|E

500|$|Friedman was a {{supporter}} of the candidacy of Barry Goldwater against Lyndon Johnson following Kennedy in 1964. Later, he served as a member of President Reagan's Economic Policy Advisory Board starting at 1981. In 1988, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the National Medal of Science. He said that he was a libertarian philosophically, but a member of the U.S. Republican Party for the sake of [...] "expediency" [...] ("I am a libertarian with a small 'l' and a Republican with a capital 'R.' And I am a Republican with a capital 'R' on grounds of expediency, not on principle.") But, he said, [...] "I think the term classical liberal is also equally applicable. I don't really care very much what I'm called. I'm <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in having people thinking about the ideas, rather than the person." ...|$|E
500|$|The Hot Lunch {{script was}} sent to Alan Parker {{after the release of}} his {{previous}} film Midnight Express (1978). He chose to work on the project as he wanted make his next film in the United States, and signed on as its director in February 1979. Parker met with De Silva in Manhattan, New York, where it was decided that he would draft his own script with Gore receiving sole screenwriting credit and Parker's colleague Alan Marshall being enlisted as a producer. Gore travelled to London, England, where he and Parker began work on a second draft script. Their new script became significantly darker than what De Silva had originally intended. De Silva said, [...] "I was really motivated and interested in the joy of what the school represented for these kids, and [...] was really <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in where the pain was in going to the school, and so we had our little conflicts based on that area." ...|$|E
500|$|Webber hired Ben van Os as his {{production}} designer because [...] "... he wasn't {{intimidated by the}} period obligations. He was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in story and character." [...] For inspiration in constructing the film's sets, Webber and van Os studied the works of Vermeer and other artists of the period, such as Gerard ter Borch. Set designer Todd van Hulzen said {{the goal was to}} [...] "... reflect that quiet, sober, almost moralizing ethos that you see in Dutch paintings." [...] They built Vermeer's house on one of Luxembourg's largest film soundstages, a three-story set where they designed rooms that were meant to convey a lack of privacy. According to van Os, the film was about [...] "being observed," [...] so they intended Griet to always feel that she was being watched. In addition, they built two other interior sets to represent the homes of Griet and van Ruijven– Griet's home possessed Calvinistic characteristics while van Ruijven's contained mounted animals to reflect his [...] "predatory nature." [...] The Mauritshuis museum made a high resolution photograph of the actual painting, which was then shot on a rostrum camera {{to be used in the}} film.|$|E
50|$|Starting with Archilei (1589), the treatises {{bring in}} {{a new set of}} {{expressive}} devices called graces alongside the divisions.

50|$|If a sufficiently-wide {{range of}} {{variables}} {{were to be}} tested, a normal shmoo plot would show an operating envelope of some shape not unlike Al Capp's Shmoo, but in practice, this might damage the device under test, and finer-grained views are of <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interest,</b> particularly focusing on published component margins (e.g., - 5% Vcc). When this is done, the operating envelope typically extends to {{the border of the}} plot in one or more directions.|$|R

500|$|Vicious Cycle then {{submitted}} the concept to art company Massive Black Studios to develop initial character sketches. [...] Massive Black's artists {{were allowed to}} use their imagination while developing Fred, but the one stipulation Vicious Cycle made from the beginning was Fred's head—the developers {{wanted it to be}} a liquid-filled jar with the detective's brain and eyes floating around inside. [...] Massive Black came up with several different versions of Fred, including some with guns, which lead designer Adam Cogan had already decided the game would not include. [...] After receiving the sketches, Vicious Cycle chose several that portrayed Fred with a squat, childlike appearance that retained some of the youthful focus of the scrapped Geo project. [...] The publisher, D3, decided to present all of the concept art to a test group. [...] To the developers' surprise, the test group was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in a darker, more intimidating portrayal of Fred than the cartoonish, playful look they had chosen. [...] The developers decided to flesh out the concept and took the chosen sketches back to Massive Black. [...] This time the art came back darker, with similarities to Dirty Harry and The Matrix and The Evil Dead, and a Norman Rockwell-inspired look that would influence the game's art style towards a more violent theme.|$|E
500|$|The Marsh {{family is}} {{spending}} Stan's ninth birthday {{at a public}} aquarium in Denver. As the Marshes enjoy interacting with the trained bottlenose dolphins, Japanese armed with spears suddenly storm the dolphinarium and kill all the dolphins. The Japanese perform similar attacks at several other aquariums, and at an NFL game, where they kill members of the Miami Dolphins football team. Stan asks his friends Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny to help him take on the cause of saving the dolphins and whales from the Japanese. Kyle declines, feeling they can't change Japan's views on the issue. Cartman and Kenny are <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in playing the video game Rock Band, professing they [...] "don't give two shits about stupid-ass whales". Eventually, Butters (who is also too busy) informs Stan about the television show Whale Wars, stating that they can take volunteers to help them. Seeing this as his chance, Stan takes Butters' advice and joins host Paul Watson and his crew aboard the Sea Shepherd, but is underwhelmed by their method of throwing [...] "stinky butter" [...] at Japanese whalers {{in an effort to}} deter them. After the Japanese whalers kill Watson with a harpoon, Stan destroys their ship by igniting their fuel barrels with a flare gun. Stan becomes the new captain and leads a more successful campaign in impeding the Japanese whaling effort by employing more aggressive methods. The crew ends up getting interviewed by Larry King, who describes Paul Watson as an [...] "incompetent media whore" [...] and questions Stan on his intentions of increasing ratings with violence. Stan dismisses the charge and contends he is only interested in saving the whales, not ratings.|$|E
500|$|Two {{years of}} {{kindergarten}} were offered, beginning at age four, and students progressed through to first grade {{with other students}} their age. The Cottage School was free to all students, and was supported both by Coonley's own resources and funds raised by the Kindergarten Education Association. The Association, of which Coonley was president, promoted new educational ideas and raised money to help support them. In 1915, John Dewey and his daughter Evelyn featured the Cottage School in their book, The Schools of To-Morrow, which examined how progressive {{schools around the country}} put new educational ideas into action. They were especially struck by how prominently nature featured in school life, noting that they have, for example, a rare bird that is as much a personality in school life as any of the children, and the children, having cared for him and watched his growth and habits, have become <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in wild birds. In the backyard is a goat, the best liked thing on the place, where the children have raised him from a little kid; and they still do all the work of caring for him. The Deweys held the Cottage School as an example of training in good citizenship, commenting on its mock elections, self-government, and public service: [...] "The school organized by the pupils into a civic league has made itself responsible for the conditions of the streets in certain portions of town, and is not only cleaning up but trying to get the rest of the town interested in the problem." [...] The teaching of English was also noted, as it was not taught as a separate subject but as part of history lessons, journal-keeping, and other exercises. Dewey wrote, [...] "The emphasis is put on helping the child to express his ideas; but such work provides ample opportunity for the required drill in the mechanics of writing." ...|$|E
