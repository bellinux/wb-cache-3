40|$|Anthropizations are {{necessary}} to implement the maintenance, recovery and utilization of wetlands. These interventions should be sustainable in every sense, in particular they should be marked by a low environmental impact. In general this aim {{can be achieved by}} using natural materials and carrying out procedures minimally invasive. In Developing Countries the latter point is often supported by the lack of equipment and energy availability, normally obtainable in Industrialized Countries. In practice, to build micro-infrastructures with the above said characteristics, it is normally necessary to drive poles, in our case in wood, in marshland’s soil. In order to accomplish this task a manually <b>operated</b> <b>pile</b> <b>driver</b> was designed and built.

5000|$|There are {{a number}} of claims to the {{invention}} of the <b>pile</b> <b>driver.</b> A mechanically sound drawing of a <b>pile</b> <b>driver</b> appeared as early as 1475 in Francesco di Giorgio Martini's treatise Trattato di Architectura.

However, there is evidence that a comparable device was used in the construction of Crannogs at Oakbank and Loch Tay in Scotland as early as 5000 years ago. In 1801 John Rennie came up with a steam piledriver in Britain. Otis Tufts is credited with inventing the steam <b>pile</b> <b>driver</b> in the United States.|$|R

40|$|The use of {{centrifuge}} modeling {{offers another}} way for geotechnical engineers {{to investigate the}} loaded driven pile behaviors. It {{is well known that}} centrifuge tests take the place of in site tests to perform parametric studies useful to get a database for recommendations and to improve design codes. To accurately simulate loaded driven pile behavior, some conditions must be satisfied. A fundamental one is the checking of similitude laws linked to the pile behavior; the second concern an experimental aspect i. e. the installation of driven pile. To study and to fill these conditions, centrifuge pile hammers must be developed. A first difficulty is to conceive a miniature hammer supporting macro gravity effects and to achieve a model pile driving in flight. The paper describes the similitude laws linked to the driving of a pile and some of them have been already checked and validated during a pile driving centrifuge tests using a miniature <b>pile</b> <b>driver.</b> A recap of centrifuge <b>pile</b> <b>drivers</b> is proposed before to describe in details the last two <b>pile</b> <b>drivers</b> used the LCPC centrifuge. One has been developed to check similitude laws inherent to a pile driving; a second miniature <b>pile</b> <b>driver</b> directly adapted {{on the top of the}} pile has been also tested. For both <b>pile</b> <b>drivers,</b> limits and performances of them are given and taking into account them, a concept of a new one <b>pile</b> <b>driver</b> is given able to drive and to load the model pile...|$|R
