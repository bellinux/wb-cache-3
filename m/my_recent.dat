[...] During a Q session in January 2009, Chabon added that he was writing a [...] "naturalistic" [...] novel about two families in Berkeley. In a March 2010 {{interview with}} the Guardian newspaper, Chabon added that [...] "So far there's no overtly genre content: it's set in the present day and has no alternate reality or anything like that." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2014, Nash {{announced}} that the 2014–15 season would be his last. During the preseason, he experienced back pain, and further aggravated his back while lifting luggage. On October 23, {{less than a week}} before the start of what would have been the 40-year-old Nash's 19th year in the NBA, he was ruled out for the season due to a recurring back injury. Nash only played in three preseason games before he started to feel more pain in his back. Nash on injuring his back: [...] "Being on the court this season has been my top priority, and it is disappointing to {{not be able to do}} that right now. I work very hard to stay healthy, and unfortunately <b>my</b> <b>recent</b> setback makes performing at full capacity difficult. I will continue to support my team during this period of rest and will focus on my long-term health." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{he worked}} on the mural, Picasso said: [...] "The Spanish {{struggle}} is the fight of reaction against the people, against freedom. My whole life as an artist has been nothing more than a continuous struggle against reaction and the death of art. How could anybody think for a moment that I could be in agreement with reaction and death? ... In the panel on which I am working, which I shall call Guernica, and in all <b>my</b> <b>recent</b> works of art, I clearly express my abhorrence of the military caste which has sunk Spain in an ocean of pain and death." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jonathan Goldman {{identifies}} a major aesthetic {{shift in}} Boulez’s {{work from the}} mid-1970s onwards, characterised variously {{by the presence of}} thematic writing, a return to vertical harmony and to clarity and legibility of form. He sees this shift reflected in Boulez's writings from the period in which he senses a great concern for the audience, for the way his works are to be perceived, not only the way they are conceived and constructed. Boulez himself said: [...] "the envelope is simpler. The contents are not ... I think in <b>my</b> <b>recent</b> work {{it is true that the}} first approach is more direct, and the gesture is more obvious, let's say." [...] The works from this period are amongst his most frequently performed.|$|E

2500|$|Hello Folks, Donna Deegan here. For {{those of}} you who haven't been {{watching}} this past week, where've you been? Seriously, if you haven't had the time to tune in, I have changed my name to, well, my name. So many of you have e-mailed to say [...] "Hey Donna, it's about time!" [...] Well, fortunately the station thought so too. Tim and I have been married for more than five years, and I have been Deegan everywhere but on the air since then. So why now? Well, there is no great strategy here. For some time now the station has been putting together a new look for our news opens, graphics etc. That's a big deal and very expensive so it's not done very often. While making those plans they very graciously asked if I would like to change my on-air name. I talked it over with my kids and with Tim and everyone said [...] "go for it" [...] so I did. That simple. The decision {{had nothing to do with}} <b>my</b> <b>recent</b> recurrence. It will be fun to see if I can actually call myself the correct name every day. Between chemo and my normal space cadet nature, I think the betting pool is in full swing.|$|E
