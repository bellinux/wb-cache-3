5|$|Following {{his failure}} to defeat Liu Kang in the Mortal Kombat tournament, the evil Shang Tsung begs his master Shao Kahn, supreme ruler of Outworld and the {{surrounding}} kingdoms, to spare his life. He tells Shao Kahn that if they hold it in Outworld the invitation for the next Mortal Kombat cannot be turned down, and the Earthrealm warriors must attend. Kahn agrees to this plan and also restores Shang Tsung's youth. He then extends the invitation to the thunder god and Earthrealm's protector, Raiden, who gathers his warriors and takes them into Outworld.

25|$|Fentanyl analogues may be {{hundreds}} of times more potent than street heroin, and tend to produce significantly more respiratory depression, making it <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> than heroin to users. Fentanyl is used orally, smoked, snorted, or injected. Fentanyl is sometimes sold as heroin or oxycodone, often leading to overdoses. Many fentanyl overdoses are initially classified as heroin overdoses. Estonia has {{the highest rate of}} 3-methylfentanyl overdose deaths in the EU, due to its high rate of recreational use.|$|E
25|$|The {{fighting}} between Ayutthaya and Lan Na resumed between 1494 and 1530. During this period, Lan Na constantly raided their neighbors to their south while Ayutthaya repeatedly mounted invasions in retaliation. Ramathibodi II became king of Ayutthaya in 1491 and ruled until 1529. He instituted {{compulsory military service}} to help fight his wars. The Burmese–Siamese War in 1547–49 was inconclusive. A <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> threat developed when Bayinnaung became king of Burma in 1551. Starting in 1563 Bayinnaung conquered both Lan Na and Ayutthaya.

As invasion became more likely, it participated in the strikes on French harbours and airfields, laying mines, and mounting numerous reconnaissance missions over the enemy-held coast. In all, some 9,180 sorties were flown by bombers from July to October 1940. Although this was much less than the 80,000 sorties flown by fighters, bomber crews suffered about half the total number of casualties borne by their fighter colleagues.

25|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} steampowered {{vessels in the}} world's merchant marine services {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries radically altered the economics of seafaring. Without acres of canvas to be furled and unfurled, the demand for unskilled labor (and, by extension, crimping) greatly diminished. The sinking of the RMS Titanic, followed by onset of World War I (which made the high seas a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> place due to the threat of submarine attack) provided the final impetus to stamp out the practice. In 1915, Andrew Furuseth and Senator Robert M. La Follette Sr. pushed through the Seamen's Act of 1915 that made crimping a federal crime, and finally put an end to it.|$|E

In order for players to avoid contact, they need to use their 'Survivor Sense' to locate the infected in the dark to stay out of their way. If spotted and trying to escape their pursuers, players can use distractions and traps to lower their numbers. Players can use sound to lure the enemies. The player's main defense against the infected is ultraviolet light, which slows them down.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} for blackout on ascent differs from hyperventilation induced hypocapnia expedited blackouts {{and does not}} necessarily follow hyperventilation. However, hyperventilation will exacerbate the risk {{and there is no}} clear line between them. Shallow water blackouts can happen in extremely shallow water, even on dry land following hyperventilation and apnoea but the effect becomes <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> in the ascent stage of a deep freedive. There is considerable confusion surrounding the terms shallow and deep water blackout and they have been used to refer to different things, or be used interchangeably, in different water sports circles. For example, the term shallow water blackout has been used to describe blackout on ascent because the blackout usually occurs when the diver ascends to a shallow depth.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example is}} from Whorf's {{experience}} as a chemical engineer working for an insurance company as a fire inspector. While inspecting a chemical plant he observed that the plant had two storage rooms for gasoline barrels, one for the full barrels {{and one for the}} empty ones. He further noticed that while no employees smoked cigarettes in the room for full barrels, no-one minded smoking in the room with empty barrels, although this was potentially <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> because of the highly flammable vapors still in the barrels. He concluded that {{the use of the word}} empty in connection to the barrels had led the workers to unconsciously regard them as harmless, although consciously they were probably aware of the risk of explosion. This example was later criticized by Lenneberg as not actually demonstrating causality between the use of the word empty and the action of smoking, but instead was an example of circular reasoning. Pinker in The Language Instinct ridiculed this example, claiming that this was a failing of human insight rather than language.|$|E

25|$|Centimetric radar, made {{possible}} by the cavity magnetron, allowed for the detection of much smaller objects and the use of much smaller antennas. The combination of small-cavity magnetrons, small antennas, and high resolution allowed small, high quality radars to be installed in aircraft. They could be used by maritime patrol aircraft to detect objects as small as a submarine periscope, which allowed aircraft to attack and destroy submerged submarines which had previously been undetectable from the air. Centimetric contour mapping radars like H2S improved the accuracy of Allied bombers used in the strategic bombing campaign, despite the existence of the German FuG 350 Naxos device to specifically detect it. Centimetric gun-laying radars were likewise far more accurate than the older technology. They made the big-gunned Allied battleships more deadly and, along with the newly developed proximity fuze, made anti-aircraft guns <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> to attacking aircraft. The two coupled together and used by anti-aircraft batteries, placed along the flight path of German V-1 flying bombs on their way to London, are credited with destroying many of the flying bombs before they reached their target.|$|E
25|$|A {{short-term}} {{exposure to}} vacuum {{of up to}} 30 seconds is unlikely to cause permanent physical damage. Animal experiments show that rapid and complete recovery is normal for exposures shorter than 90 seconds, while longer full-body exposures are fatal and resuscitation has never been successful. There is only {{a limited amount of}} data available from human accidents, but it is consistent with animal data. Limbs may be exposed for much longer if breathing is not impaired. Rapid decompression can be <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> than vacuum exposure itself. Even if the victim does not hold their breath, venting through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the fatal rupture of the delicate alveoli of the lungs. Eardrums and sinuses may be ruptured by rapid decompression, soft tissues may bruise and seep blood, and the stress of shock accelerates oxygen consumption, leading to hypoxia. Injuries caused by rapid decompression are called barotrauma, and are well known from scuba diving accidents. A pressure drop as small as 100 Torr (13 kPa), which produces no symptoms if it is gradual, may be fatal if it occurs suddenly.|$|E

60|$|Nevertheless such shrewd {{men were}} forced to admit that, however poor a figure the Florentine {{government}} made in its clumsy pretence of a judicial warrant for what had in fact been predetermined {{as an act of}} policy, the measures of the Pope against Savonarola were necessary measures of self-defence.
