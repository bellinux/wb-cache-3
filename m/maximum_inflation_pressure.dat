40|$|Sixty-eight sets of {{deflation}} {{data from}} the left lungs of children who had died from non-pulmonary causes were analysed by the exponential equation model to derive theoretical values of Pst(1) for 50, 60, and 90 % of the observed maximum inflation volume. The resultant P 50, 60, and 90 values were compared to the same values measured from graphic displays of the V-P data. The graphically derived Pst(1) data at 50, 60, and 90 % of TLC were then plotted against the crown-heel length to demonstrate a shape change related to physical growth. It {{was found that the}} form of the deflation curve in preterm infants did not fit an exponential model as satisfactorily as did the deflation curve from older children. The exponential model should be used with caution in small infants where Pst(1) values below P 90 are sought.

40|$|Semistatic air volume-pressure (V-P) loops were {{recorded}} from 172 isolated lungs obtained from {{infants and children}} at necropsy. Technically unsatisfactory V-P loop behaviour {{and the presence of}} pathological changes led to the exclusion of 98 lungs. A further 10 lungs were excluded as it was decided to study the period of growth up to 90 cm crown-heel length. A total of 64 left lungs remained which were designated "normal". Control data were collected in an attempt to quantify the effects of storage and variations in inflation technique. A <b>maximum</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> of + 30 cmH 2 O was used as a standard Pmax. The resulting maximum inflation volume (Vmax) data showed a cubic relation to the crown-heel length which deviated from the values obtained by the use of in-vivo regression equations. The extent and pattern of the deviation suggest that the technical factors are not a major contributory cause, and other explanations are discussed. The low-pressure proportional data from the deflation limb of the V-P curve are plotted against the crown-hell length, and the resulting curve is analysed. There is a sharp fall in the proportion of Vmax retained in the lung at + 5 cmH 2 O and + 2 - 5 cmH 2 O with increasing body length, but proportional volume at zero transpulmonary pressure follows the same growth-related pattern as Vmax...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The Tissue Removal Assessment with Ultrasound of the SFA and Popliteal (TRUTH) study {{assessed}} the perfor-mance of the orbital atherectomy system (OAS) to treat femoropopliteal arteries, including determining {{its effect on}} plaque removal. Methods: Patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal peripheral arterial disease were treated with the OAS followed by adjunctive balloon angioplasty (BA). Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) images were collected pre- and post-OAS and post-OAS BA. Patients were followed through 12 months post-procedure. Results: Twenty-nine lesions were treated with OAS-BA in 25 patients. The mean <b>maximum</b> balloon <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> was 5. 2 + 1. 2 atm. Virtual histology IVUS (VH-IVUS) analysis revealed at the maximum calcium ablation site that calcium reduction was responsible for 86 % of the lumen area increase. The minimum lumen area increased from 4. 0 mm 2 to 9. 1 mm 2 (<. 0001), {{and the percentage of}} area stenosis decreased from 76. 9 % to 43. 0 % (<. 0001) after OAS-BA. At 12 months, the target lesion revascularization rate was 8. 2 %, and ankle–brachial index and Rutherford classification improved significantly from baseline through follow-up. Conclusion: The VH-IVUS analysis reveals that OAS modifies the calcified component of the plaque burden. It is hypothesized that calcium modification by OAS changes the lesion compliance, allowing for low pressure adjunctive BA. The clinical outcomes were favorable through 12 -month follow-up...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Endotracheal {{intubation}} is {{a common}} intervention in critical care patients undergoing helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) transportation. Measurement of endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff pressures is not common practice in patients referred to our service. Animal studies have demonstrated an association between {{the pressure of the}} ETT cuff on the tracheal mucosa and decreased blood flow leading to mucosal ischemia and scarring. Cuff pressures greater than 30 cmH 2 O impede mucosal capillary blood flow. Multiple prior studies have recommended 30 cmH 2 O as the <b>maximum</b> safe cuff <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure.</b> This study sought to evaluate the <b>inflation</b> <b>pressures</b> in ETT cuffs of patients presenting to HEMS. METHODS: We enrolled a convenience sample of patients presenting to UMass Memorial LifeFlight who were intubated by the sending facility or emergency medical services (EMS) agency. Flight crews measured the ETT cuff pressures using a commercially available device. Those patients intubated by the flight crew were excluded from this analysis as the cuff was inflated with the manometer to a standardized pressure. Crews logged the results on a research form, and we analyzed the data using Microsoft Excel and an online statistical analysis tool. RESULTS: We analyzed data for 55 patients. There was a mean age of 57 years (range 18 - 90). The mean ETT cuff pressure was 70 (95...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundBioresorbable {{vascular}} scaffolds (BVS) {{have been}} developed to provide support to the vessel wall during the healing process after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), being resorbed afterwards. Because the scaffold is made of polymeric material, there is a concern regarding the acute recoil of the device. We compared the BVS acute recoil with that of two different metal drug-eluting stents. MethodsFifty patients with non-complex lesions were included. Twenty-five of these patients were treated with a BVS who were compared to 25 patients treated with a cobalt-chromium everolimus-eluting stent (EES, n= 12) or a stainless steel biolimus-eluting stent (BES, n= 13). Acute recoil was defined as the difference between the mean diameter of the balloon during its <b>maximum</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> (X) and the mean diameter of the stent immediately after balloon deflation (Y). The percentage of acute recoil was defined as (X-Y) /X. ResultsThere {{was no significant difference in}} the baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics. Acute luminal gain was lower with BVS compared to EES and BES (1. 51 ± 0. 41 mm vs. 1. 76 ± 0. 28 mm vs. 1. 9 ± 0. 42 mm, P= 0. 02). Acute recoil was 0. 21 ± 0. 13 mm vs. 0. 15 ± 0. 08 mm vs. 0. 14 ± 0. 08 mm (P= 0. 21) and the percentage of acute recoil was 7. 0 ± 4. 6 % vs. 5. 0 ± 2. 2 % vs. 5. 7 ± 4. 1 % (P= 0. 16).

40|$|SummaryBackground and objectivesThe {{incidence}} of definite stent thrombosis (ST) after use of drug-eluting stents (DES), {{as defined by}} the Academic Research Consortium, is known to be lower in Japan than in western countries. However, a statistical difference in the {{incidence of}} early definite ST (EDST) associated with the unrestricted use of DES has not yet been documented. Therefore, the incidence of EDST in our Japanese institute after unrestricted use of DES was retrospectively compared with those reported in western mega-studies. Methods and resultsDuring the 40 months from August 2004 to November 2007 (before approval of clopidogrel in Japan), DES were implanted in 3605 lesions in 1885 patients in our institute; lesion- and patient-associated percentages of DES use were 95. 2 % and 94. 7 %, respectively. Mean stent length per lesion was 33. 2 mm, emergent procedures and ST-elevation myocardial infarctions made up 33. 7 % and 16. 4 % of the procedures, respectively, intravascular ultrasonography was used 96. 0 % of the time, a distal protection device for acute coronary syndrome was used 68. 7 % of the time, and the mean <b>maximum</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> was 19. 5 atm. EDST was observed in five lesions (0. 139 %) in four patients (0. 212 %). The incidence of patient-associated EDST at our center was significantly lower than in four western mega-studies (0. 736 %, 66 of 8970 patients; 0. 634 %, 149 of 23, 500; 0. 595 %, 52 of 8402; 0. 997 %, 20 of 2006) (p< 0. 05, < 0. 01, < 0. 05, < 0. 01, respectively, using a χ 2 -test).

40|$|BackgroundTraditional {{teaching}} {{assumes that}} the distal arterial tree is maximally dilated in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI). Endovascular or arterial bypass procedures are the commonly used interventions to increase distal perfusion. However, other forms of treatment such as spinal cord stimulation or intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) {{have been shown to}} improve limb salvage rates. This prospective study was designed to determine if the use of IPC increases popliteal, gastrocnemial, collateral arterial, and skin blood flow in patients with CLI. MethodsTwenty limbs with CLI in 20 patients (mean age, 74 years) were evaluated with duplex ultrasound scans and laser Doppler fluxmetry in the semi-erect position before, during, and after IPC. One pneumatic cuff was applied on the foot and the other on the calf. The <b>maximum</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> was 120 mm Hg and was applied for 3 seconds at three cycles per minute. All patients had at least two-level disease by arteriography. Fourteen limbs were characterized as inoperable, and six were considered marginal for reconstruction. Flow volumes were measured in the popliteal, medial gastrocnemial, and a genicular collateral artery. Skin blood flux was measured on the dorsum of the foot at the same time. ResultsSignificant flow increase during the application of IPC was found in all three arteries (18 / 20 limbs) compared with baseline values (P <. 02). The highest change was seen in the popliteal, followed by the gastrocnemial and the collateral artery. After the cessation of IPC, the flow returned to baseline. This was attributed to the elevation of time average velocity, as the diameter of the arteries remained unchanged. The skin blood flux increased significantly as well (P <. 03). In the two limbs without an increase in the arterial or skin blood flow, significant popliteal vein reflux was found. Both limbs were amputated shortly after. ConclusionsIPC increases axial, muscular, collateral, and skin blood flow in patients with CLI and may be beneficial to those who are not candidates for revascularization. Patients with significant venous reflux may not benefit from IPC. This supports the theory that one of the mechanisms by which IPC enhances flow is by increasing the arteriovenous pressure gradient...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Encountering {{soil from}} the {{viewpoint}} of management and product manufacturing has always been considered important, and an attempt is always made hat the tools and contrasting methods of soil be designed {{in such a way that}} itself prevents, as much as possible, the destructive consequences or energy waste that include economical or environmental limitations. Enhancing the soil encountering methods, quality reformation, and its related equipment, requires performing reliable tests in actual soil conditions. Considering the complexity and variety of variables in soil and machine contrast, this is a hard task. Hence, the numeral simulations are the key of all optimizations that illustrate efficient models by removing the costly farm tests and reducing research time. Tire is one of the main factors engaged with soil, and it is one of those tools that are discussable in both farms, and software environments. Despite the complexities in soil behavior, and tire geometry, modeling, tire movement on the soil has been the researchers’ objective from the past. Materials and methods: A non-linear finite element (FE) model of the interaction of a non-driving tire with soil surface was developed to investigate the influence of the forward speed, tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> and vertical load on rolling resistance using ABAQUS/Explicit code. In this research numerical and experimental tests were done under different conditions in order to estimate tire rolling resistance. In numerical tests, the soil part was simulated as a one-layer viscous-elastic material with a Drucker-Prager model by considering realistic soil properties. These properties included elastic and plastic properties which were obtained in the soil laboratory using relevant tests. The soil samples were prepared from the soil which was inside the soil bin. The same soil was utilized in experimental tests. Finite strain hyper elasticity model is developed to model nearly incompressible rubber materials for the tire. Tire model consisted of three components: tread, rubber and ring. Using a soil bin and one wheel tester with their related equipment, experimental tests were carried out in the workstation of mechanics of bio system engineering department of the Urmia University. This system includes various sections such as soil storage in dimensions of 22 × 2 × 1 meter, tools carrier or tracker, soil processing equipment, dynamic system, evaluation tools and controlling systems. In order to launch the collection and supply required power for wheel carrier, an industrial three phase electromotor with 22 kW (30 hp) was used. Both numerical and experimental tests were done at three levels of wheel dynamic load (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) kN, tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> (100, 200 and 300) kPa and four levels of speed (0. 25, 0. 45, 0. 65, 0. 9 and 1. 15) m s- 1 to obtain the rolling resistance of the tire. Results and discussion: In order to evaluate the performance of final non driving tire-soil model to estimate the rolling resistance, numerical results were compared with preliminary experimental data obtained from the soil-bin tests. The comparison showed reasonably good agreement between the computed and measured general pattern of the rolling resistance at the tire-soil interface under different speeds, vertical loads and <b>inflation</b> <b>pressures.</b> In both tests, a specified relation was not seen between tire velocity and its rolling resistance, as it was not seen in empirical models such as Wismar and Luce. Correlation coefficient between experimental and numerical data, in the minimum and maximum value of tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> was computed to be 0. 06 and 0. 016 percent, respectively. The amount of tire rolling resistance significantly increased with increase of tire vertical load. Correlation coefficient between experimental and numerical data, in the minimum and maximum vertical loads was computed to be 80 and 87 percent, respectively. Gent and Walter obtained the same results. The tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> and rolling resistance variables had inverse relation to each other in both numerical and experimental tests. Correlation coefficient between experimental and numerical data was computed to be 97 and 73 percent in the minimum and <b>maximum</b> tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure,</b> respectively. The gradient of changes in tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> - rolling resistance diagram was less in numerical tests. This was because of differences between real properties and the properties entered into the software. Conclusions: To conclude, in this investigation a new 3 D tire-soil model was simulated which has specific features. The experimental results showed that the numerical data of estimation of non-driven tire rolling resistance were reliable. In both tests, the effect of changes in tire forward speed on rolling resistance was not significant. The amount of the tire rolling resistance significantly increased with increasing tire vertical load. Changes in tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> and rolling resistance had an inverse relation with each other in both numerical and experimental tests. The slope of rolling resistance - <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> diagram in numerical tests was less than the same diagram in the experimental tests...|$|R

40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 P RS Leung 2016 xxvi, 256 pages :color illustrationsColorectal {{cancer is}} the second most common cause of cancer in Hong Kong. Colonoscopy is a common {{procedure}} for examination and early screening of cancerous or malignant lesions of the large bowel. Although it is a minimally invasive procedure, it is often associated with abdominal pain and discomfort. Sedative medication commonly used to minimize the unpleasant discomfort during colonoscopy is associated with significant side effects including cardiopulmonary dysfunction. These undesirable effects can prolong recovery time and increase intervention risk in a day-case setting. Acupuncture, a technique used for management of diseases for thousands of years in China has been widely used in western countries as a treatment modality for suppression of musculoskeletal pain. Reports on the use of acupuncture for management of abdominal pain in gastroenterology are scanty and the role of acupuncture in pain relief during endoscopic procedures has not been explored. While acupuncture may be effective, it is an invasive procedure and associated side effects have been reported. Application of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation over acupuncture points (Acu-TENS), a non-invasive modality for pain relief has received increasing attention in recent years. The aims of this thesis were therefore to explore the role of electro-acupuncture and Acu-TENS, and their possible associated mechanism, in relief of discomfort during colonoscopy. The investigatory work reported in this thesis was conducted in two phase. Phase I of the thesis involved two pilot studies which explored the effect of electro-acupuncture and Acu-TENS on the relief of rectal discomfort induced by a Barostat. The Barostat allows controlled air-inflation in the rectal region and is designed to investigate visceral pain by mimicking the initial colonoscopy procedure. Phase II of the thesis explored the effect of electro-acupuncture and Acu-TENS on the consumption of analgesic medication in subjects receiving a colonoscopy procedure. The first pilot study involved forty healthy subjects, who were scheduled for a voluntary and free colonoscopy screening for bowel cancer in a public hospital. Subjects were invited to participate in a "Barostat trial¨ in the morning prior to the scheduled colonoscopy and consented subjects were randomized to receive either electro-acupuncture (EA) or sham acupuncture (SA) at Hegu (LI- 4), Neiguan (PC- 6) and Zusanli (ST- 36) for forty-five minutes prior to the Barostat trial. SA was similar to EA except that short studs instead of actual acupuncture needles were used and there was no puncture of the skin. The Barostat trial involved insertion of a balloon catheter into the rectum with a standardized, incremental (4 mmHg) rise in balloon inflation pressure. Colorectal discomfort experienced with each increment rise in pressure was assessed by a visual analogue (VAS) and a 4 -point subjective discomfort scale. Blood beta-endorphin levels were measured before and immediately after electro-acupuncture, and at an inflation pressure of 24 mmHg, {{as well as at the}} maximum pressure tolerated. Results of this pilot study showed that onset of rectal discomfort was reported at a higher inflation pressure in the EA group compared to the SA group (43. 5 mmHg ± 6. 6 mmHg and 35. 6 mmHg ± 8. 8 mmHg, respectively, p = 0. 007)). Twelve subjects in the EA group tolerated the <b>maximum</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> (48 mmHg) compared to only 4 in the SA group. Beta-endorphin levels increased significantly in the EA group but not in the SA group (1. 25 ± 0. 45 ng/ml and 0. 79 ± 0. 17 ng/ml respectively, p 40 mmHg) (65 % in Acu-TENS vs 25 % in placebo, p= 0. 02) compared to the placebo group. The plasma beta-endorphin levels of the Acu-TENS group were significantly higher than that of the placebo group. These findings suggested Acu-TENS is a safe and effective modality in reduction of colorectal pain and probably with a mechanism that is associated with an increase in beta-endorphin level. The positive and encouraging results from these two pilot studies form the foundation of the two main studies which explored the effect of electro-acupuncture and Acu-TENS during the actual colonoscopy procedure and in a larger population sample. The third study reported in this thesis involved 128 consecutive asymptomatic subjects scheduled for colonoscopy screening in a regional hospital. Recruited subjects were randomized to receive either electro-acupuncture (EA) or sham acupuncture (SA) (short stud instead of needle) over acupuncture points Hegu (LI- 4), Neiguan (PC- 6) and Zusanli (ST- 36) for 45 minutes prior to the colonoscopy procedure. Following the normal routine for patients undergoing a colonoscopy, a patient controlled mixture of propofol and alfentanil was established (Patient Controlled Analgesia -PCA). Outcome measures used included the dosage of the analgesic mixture consumed, subjective pain scores during colonoscopy, the subject's "satisfaction" score for the procedure, the endoscopist's satisfaction score for the procedure and the caecal intubation time. All outcome measures were recorded by an independent assessor who was blinded to the randomization allocation. Results of this study demonstrated that the mean dose of analgesics used in EA group was significantly lower than in the SA group (0. 19 mg/kg vs. 0. 61 mg/kg, p< 0. 001). Subjective pain score (2. 7 vs. 4. 5, p< 0. 001) was lower and satisfaction score (9. 4 vs. 8. 8, p= 0. 016) was higher in the EA group compared to the SA group. Caecal intubation was also significantly faster in the EA group (7. 5 mins vs. 9. 6 mins in SA group, p= 0. 015). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that electro-acupuncture was an independent predictor of a lower analgesia dose (coefficient B - 0. 383, p< 0. 001). This study showed that use of electro-acupuncture allowed a significant reduction in consumption of sedation, as well as an effective lowering of subjective pain scores in subjects undergoing colonoscopy. The 4 th and final study presented in this thesis involved another 135 consecutive asymptomatic patients undergoing first-time elective colonoscopy. Subjects were randomized to receive either Acu-TENS (n = 68) or placebo-TENS (n = 67) before colonoscopy. Similar acupoints, Hegu (LI- 4), Neiguan (PC- 6) and Zusanli (ST- 36) to the other studies were used. A propofol/alfentanil PCA mixture was used for sedation/analgesia in both groups. All subjects and the endoscopists were blinded to the treatment allocation and the outcome measures were similar to those used previously. The results showed that the mean analgesic/sedative dose was significantly lower in the Acu-TENS group compared to the placebo-TENS group (0. 25 mg/kg vs. 0. 88 mg/kg; p < 0. 001). The Acu-TENS group had a lower mean pain score (4. 0 vs. 5. 6; p= 0. 006) compared to the placebo-TENS group, and a higher mean satisfaction score (9. 5 vs. 8. 9; p= 0. 015). A trend toward shorter caecal intubation time also was observed in the Acu-TENS group compared with the placebo-TENS group but this did not reached statistical significance (10. 2 mins vs. 12. 3 mins; p= 0. 061). Endoscopists in the Acu-TENS group reported a higher mean satisfaction score than those in the placebo-TENS group (8. 0 vs. 6. 8; p< 0. 001). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that shorter procedure time (p< 0. 001), absence of looping (p= 0. 036), older age (p= 0. 038) and male gender (p= 0. 042) were independent predictors of lower PCA consumption during colonoscopy in the Acu-TENS group (p< 0. 001). This study suggests that Acu-TENS is more effective than placebo-TENS in reducing procedure-related pain during the colonoscopy procedure. In summary, the work involved in this thesis showed that electro-acupuncture and Acu-TENS are associated with significantly reduced consumption of analgesic medication and more effective pain relief in subjects undergoing colonoscopy. These modalities may be considered a useful adjunct to minimize discomfort during the colonoscopy procedure. Further investigations on comparing the role of electro-acupuncture and the non-invasive Acu-TENS are warranted. Department of Rehabilitation SciencesPh.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to measure the effects of modifying tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> on the handling and rollover resistance of one 15 -passenger van (a 2003 Ford E- 350). In addition to those specified on the vehicle identification placard, four other front/rear tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> combinations were used. Multiple loading configurations were used: Nominal Load, 5 -Occupant, 10 -Occupant, and Maximum Occupancy. Not all loading configurations were used for each test. The tests performed in this study were performed in three groups. Handling in the linear range, at or near maximum lateral acceleration, and dynamic rollover resistance at the various <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> combinations were evaluated. The linear range handling measures and maximum lateral accelerations seen in this study showed measurable changes due to variations in tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure.</b> However, these small changes are believed not to be of practical significance. This is, of course, good since a high sensitivity to tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> changes could cause in-use problems. The lateral stability of the Ford E- 350 at Nominal Load was asymmetric.

40|$|Study Objectives Endotracheal {{intubation}} is {{a common}} intervention in critical care patients undergoing Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) transportation.   Measurement of endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff pressures is not common practice in patients referred to our service.   Animal studies have demonstrated an association between {{the pressure of the}} ETT cuff on the tracheal mucosa and decreased blood flow leading to mucosal ischemia and scarring.   Cuff pressures greater than 30 cmH 2 O impede mucosal capillary blood flow.   Multiple prior studies have recommended 30 cmH 2 O as the <b>maximum</b> safe cuff <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure.</b>   This study sought to evaluate the <b>inflation</b> <b>pressures</b> in ETT cuffs of patients presenting to HEMS. Methods We enrolled a convenience sample of patients presenting to UMass Memorial LifeFlight who were intubated by the sending facility or Emergency Medical Services (EMS) agency.   Flight crews measured the ETT cuff pressures using a commercially available device.   Those patients intubated by the flight crew were excluded from this analysis as the cuff was inflated with the manometer to a standardized pressure.   Crews logged the results on a research form and the data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel and an online statistical analysis tool. Results We analyzed data for 55 patients.   There was a mean age of 57 years (range 18 - 90).   The mean ETT cuff pressure was 70 (95 % CI, 61 - 80) cmH 2 O.   The mean lies 40 cmH 2 O above the maximum accepted value of 30 cmH 2 O (p 120 cmH 2 O, the maximum pressure on the analog gauge. Conclusion Patients presenting to HEMS after intubation by the referral agency (EMS or hospital) have ETT cuffs inflated to pressures that are, on average, more than double the recommended maximum.   These patients are at risk for tracheal mucosal injury and scarring from decreased mucosal capillary blood flow.   Hospital and EMS providers should use ETT cuff manometry to ensure that they inflate ETT cuffs to safe pressures...|$|R

Angiograms were obtained before, 10 minutes after, and 28 days after BA and read by two blinded observers using electronic calipers. The in vivo ballon-to-vessel ratio was measured for each group. There were eight non-BA controls. Rabbits were sacrificed either immediately (n= 34) or at 28 days after BA (n= 36), with the femoral vessels pressure perfused for histologic and morphometric analysis. The latter was performed at 28 days only. Absolute angiographic diameters increased in all groups immediately after BA (p < 0. 01).

40|$|Evaluation {{of recent}} {{advances}} in tire technologies such as advanced deflection agricultural tires (Firestone IF and VF) and precision tire inflation technologies on soil compaction, traction, fuel economy and crop yield responses are important. The {{purpose of the study}} was to investigate the effects of field and transport (road) tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> settings of row-crop agricultural tractor and planter tires on soil compaction. A randomized complete block design experiment was conducted at the Iowa State University farm at Boone, Iowa for two tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> levels on Dual Front (Firestone IF 420 / 85 R 34) and Dual Rear (Firestone IF 480 / 80 R 50) tires on a John Deere 8310 R MFWD tractor, and transport tires (Super single 445 / 50 R 22. 5) on a John Deere DB 60 planter. Soil compaction was measured using Stress State Transducers (SSTs) buried at 15 -cm and 30 -cm depths beneath the untrafficked soil surface. The soil cone index depth profile was measured at tire-centerline, tire-edge and 20 cm laterally outboard of the tire edge before and after tractor-planter tire passes. Peak Octahedral Normal Stress (ONS) and the corresponding Octahedral Shear Stress (OSS) values in soil were calculated from the SST data. The peak ONS and corresponding OSS values from the road tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> settings were statistically higher (p-value 3 ̆c 0. 05) than the field tire <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> settings.

40|$|In recent years, {{overinflated}} {{tyre pressure}} {{and the effect of}} increased heavy vehicles' axle load on flexible pavements responses have become a subject of great concern because of the higher stress level induced causing more damages to the pavements. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of various tyre <b>inflation</b> <b>pressures</b> on the determination of tyre contact/footprint area for flexible pavement. A survey to collect data on current levels of tyre <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> was carried out at two major expressways in Klang Valley, Malaysia. The full scale experiment was then conducted on a heavyvehicle with 1 : 1 : 2 axle configuration, 10 R 20 tyre size and attached trailer with constant axle load. The data showed that the operational levels and maximum recommended of tyre <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> of heavy vehicles in that area were as high as 827 kPa (120 psi). The effect of varying tyre <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> at different measured temperature on tyre contact area by conducting full-scale field experimental work revealed that the increase of tyre <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> resulted to a decrease on the images of the tyre footprint area [...] The analysis carried out to compare the tyre contact area values obtained from the fullscale field experimental work on morning session with the conventional circular area method showed that there is a big difference when the tyre <b>inflation</b> <b>pressures</b> start to increase. KENPAVE linear elastic program was used to analyse the effects of measured actual tyre-pavement contact area and the results was compared using conventional circular tyre contact area. It was found that high tyre <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> produced less contact area (actual), giving more detrimental effect on the flexible pavement compared to the conventional circular tyre contact area method. Meanwhile, it was also found that the temperature of tyres when the heavy vehicles were in operational gave less significant impact on tyre <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> for the Malaysian condition. It is recommended that for future research in this area, the scope of this study is needed to be enlarged to other expressways throughout Malaysia and other types of heavy vehicles, size of tyre and different pavement thickness to obtain additional data and higher confidence level of the effects of tyre <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure...</b>|$|R

40|$|In December 2007, a male {{equipment}} operator was fatally {{injured by}} a metal lock ring propelled from a multi-piece wheel tire assembly he was inflating. The victim was employed by an excavating and snow removal company. At {{the time of}} the incident, he and a co-worker were getting their loaders ready to remove snow from a shopping mall parking lot. Soon after he started his loader, the victim noticed that his left front tire mounted on a multi-piece wheel was “soft”(under-inflated). The multi-piece rim wheel referring to the tire assembly consisted of six components: the rim base, valve assembly, tire, side ring, O-ring and lock ring. The function of the lock ring was to hold the tire in place by locking and securing the other wheel components when the tire was inflated. The victim asked the co-worker, whose loader had an air compressor, to put air in the tire. The initial tire pressure was not checked. The co-worker connected one end of an air hose to the quick-connect fitting on the air compressor and the clip-on chuck at the other end to the valve stem of the tire. The co-worker then went to his loader’s cab and used the throttle control to maintain the airflow. The air hose did not have an in-line pressure gauge. The victim checked the air pressure at the tire valve with a hand-held pressure gauge periodically as the tire was being inflated.
