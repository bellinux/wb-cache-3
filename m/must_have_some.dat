5|$|Behaviorists {{focus on}} the {{acquisition}} and teaching of delayed gratification, and have developed therapeutic techniques for increasing ability to delay. Behavior analysts capitalize on the effective principles of reinforcement when shaping behavior by making rewards contingent on the person's current behavior, which promotes learning a delay of gratification. It {{is important to note}} that for a behavior modification regimen to succeed, the reward <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> value to the participant. Without a reward that is meaningful, providing delayed or immediate gratification serves little purpose, as the reward is not a strong reinforcer of the desired behavior.|$|E
5|$|I {{would hold}} that {{officers}} <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> level of particularized suspicion {{in order to}} conduct a seizure and search {{like the one at}} issue here, because (1) seizing one’s personal property deprives the individual of his valid possessory interest in his property, and (2) authorizing a generalized computer forensic search (untethered to any particularized suspicion) permits the Government to engage in the type of generalized fishing expeditions that the Fourth Amendment is designed to prevent.|$|E

25|$|Finally, in Federalist No. 51, Madison {{argued that}} {{to create a}} {{government}} that relied primarily on the good nature of the incumbent to ensure proper government was folly.

25|$|Since {{conscious}} awareness {{has to be}} {{coupled with}} local physical systems, the observer’s physical environment has to interact and can influence the brain. The brain itself <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> physico-chemical processes that affect the states of awareness. If these neural processes can be described and analyzed then some experiments could potentially be created to test whether affecting neural processes can {{have an effect on}} a quantum system. Speculation about the details of this awareness-local physical system coupling on a purely theoretical basis could occur, however experimentally searching for them through neurological and psychological studies would be ideal.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} morning, Granger teaches Montag and {{the others}} about the legendary phoenix and its endless cycle of long life, death in flames, and rebirth. He adds that the phoenix <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> relationship to mankind, which constantly repeats its mistakes. Granger explains that man has something the phoenix does not: mankind can remember its mistakes and try never to repeat them. Granger then muses that a large factory of mirrors should be built, so that way people can take {{a long look at}} themselves and reflect on their lives. When the meal is over, the exiles return to the city to rebuild society.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} opinion, {{written by}} Justice Anthony Kennedy, {{found that the}} constitutionally guaranteed right of habeas corpus review applies to persons held in Guantanamo and to persons designated as enemy combatants on that territory. If Congress intends to suspend the right, the Court said that an adequate substitute must offer the prisoner a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate he is held pursuant to an erroneous application or interpretation of relevant law, and the reviewing decision-making <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> ability to correct errors, to assess the sufficiency of the government's evidence, and to consider relevant exculpating evidence. The court found that the petitioners had met their burden of establishing that Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 failed to provide an adequate substitute for habeas corpus.|$|E

25|$|Although {{spironolactone}} is {{a potent}} AR antagonist with no significant progestogenic effects in women even at high dosages and hence is a pure-like AR antagonist, many studies have interestingly not {{found it to be}} progonadotropic in men, nor to increase testosterone or estradiol levels. Moreover, spironolactone is also said to possess very little or no antigonadotropic activity (in terms of lowering gonadotropin levels to below normal) even at high dosages, although some conflicting reports exist. Nonetheless, since spironolactone does not generally increase gonadotropin levels in spite of potent inhibition of androgen signaling, it <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> degree of antigonadotropic activity sufficient to at least keep gonadotropin levels from increasing. As estrogens are antigonadotropic similarly to progestogens, and as SERM-like activity has been described for spironolactone, the antigonadotropic effects of spironolactone may be due to estrogenic activity.|$|E
25|$|Systems {{that use}} {{passwords}} for authentication <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> way to check any password entered to gain access. If the valid passwords are simply {{stored in a}} system file or database, an attacker who gains sufficient access to the system will obtain all user passwords, giving the attacker access to all accounts on the attacked system, and possibly other systems where users employ the same or similar passwords. One way to reduce this risk is to store only a cryptographic hash of each password instead of the password itself. Standard cryptographic hashes, such as the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) series, are very hard to reverse, so an attacker who gets hold of the hash value cannot directly recover the password. However, knowledge of the hash value lets the attacker quickly test guesses offline. Password cracking programs are widely available that will test {{a large number of}} trial passwords against a purloined cryptographic hash.|$|E
25|$|The {{thought that}} the {{mammalian}} body <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> way of identifying introduced foreign particles first arose during World War II. Numerous theories were proposed and it wasn't until 1958 that {{the first of these}} identifying proteins was found. The first standardized naming system was established in 1968 by the WHO Nomenclature Committee for Factors of the HLA System. HLA research didn't heat up until the 1980s when a group of researchers finally elucidated the shape of the HLA-A*02 protein (just one of many specific HLA proteins). Even more recently, in 2010, the WHO committee responsible for naming all HLA proteins revised their standards for naming to introduce more clarity and specificity in the naming system. It started with a plane crash in the height of the London Blitz. The pilot suffered severe burns requiring skin grafts. However, at the time skin grafts were a risky business, often being rejected for unknown reasons. The search for a reason spanned the next four decades and in some areas is still continuing today.|$|E

5000|$|Berkson's fallacy, {{when the}} study {{population}} is selected from a hospital and so is less healthy than the general population.

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{reactions from}} critics. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, critics Mary Kaye Schilling and Mike Flaherty stated [...] "Even Seinfeld's bit players <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> grounding in reality — {{you need to}} love to hate them. Ultimately, there's no redeeming comic payoff to Rava's and Ray's weirdness". Flaherty and Schilling graded the episode with a C-. Colin Jacobson of the DVD Movie Guide called the episode's storyline [...] "fairly pedestrian", but felt the performances of Conway and Koppel saved the episode.|$|E
500|$|The game {{relies on}} a day/night cycle that causes {{meaningful}} fluctuations in gameplay style. During the day, the player spends {{most of their time}} exploring the world; gathering food, firewood, and other items; discovering [...] "recipes" [...] to combine available items; and avoiding enemies. With nightfall comes dangerous monsters as well as an invisible menace (Charlie) which attacks the player when the screen is dark. A player must either have a nearby light source or <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> sort of night vision to prevent the night monster from attacking. Crafting, which uses recipes, allows the player to build shelter, weapons, and tools like axes. The characters are able to gather and farm plants as well as hunt animals for sustenance, with several characters having dietary perks or restrictions. Food can spoil, however, so the player cannot keep it for too long. Eating spoiled food results in loss of health, sanity, and an increase in hunger. Each in-game day takes 8 minutes of real time.|$|E

500|$|But Locke does {{recommend}} several minor [...] "restrictions" [...] {{relating to}} the treatment of the female body. The most significant is his reining in of female physical activity for the sake of physical appearance: [...] "But since in your girls care is to be taken too of their beauty as much as health will permit, this in them <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> restriction ... 'tis fit their tender skins should be fenced against the busy sunbeams, especially when they are very hot and piercing." [...] Although Locke's statement indicates that he places a greater value on female than male beauty, the fact that these opinions were never published allowed contemporary readers to draw their own conclusions regarding the [...] "different treatments" [...] required for girls and boys, if any. Moreover, compared to other pedagogical theories, such as those in the best-selling conduct book The Whole Duty of a Woman (1696), the female companion to The Whole Duty of Man (1657), and Rousseau's [...] (1762), which both proposed entirely separate educational programs for women, Locke's Some Thoughts appears far more egalitarian.|$|E
500|$|It {{was about}} {{two in the morning}} of August 27 that I was awakened by seeing a soldier at the side of my bed. I got up and dressed and went down to the barroom, where I saw my father {{standing}} in one corner with three British soldiers before him with muskets and bayonets fixed. The army was then lying in the field in front of the house.... General Howe and another officer were in the barroom. General Howe wore a camlet cloak over his regimentals. After asking for a glass of liquor from the bar, which was given him, he entered into familiar conversation with my father, and among other things said, [...] "I <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> one of you to show me over the Rockaway Path around the pass." [...] My father replied, [...] "We belong to the other side, General, and can’t serve you against our duty." [...] General Howe replied, [...] "That is alright; stick to your country, or stick to your principles, but Howard, you are my prisoner and must guide my men over the hill." [...] My father made some further objection, but was silenced by the general, who said, [...] "You have no alternative. If you refuse I shall shoot you through the head." ...|$|E
500|$|The word maser {{derives from}} the acronym MASER, which stands for [...] "Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation". The maser is a {{predecessor}} to lasers, which operate at optical wavelengths, and is named by the replacement of [...] "microwave" [...] with [...] "light". Given a system of atoms or molecules, each with different energy states, an atom or molecule may absorb a photon and move to a higher energy level, or the photon may stimulate emission of another photon of the same energy and cause a transition to a lower energy level. Producing a maser requires population inversion, which is when a system has more members in a higher energy level relative to a lower energy level. In such a situation, more photons will be produced by stimulated emission than will be absorbed. Such a system is not in thermal equilibrium, and as such requires special conditions to occur. Specifically, it <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> energy source that can pump the atoms or molecules to the excited state. Once population inversion occurs, a photon with a photon energy corresponding to the energy difference between two states can then produce stimulated emission of another photon of the same energy. The atom or molecule will drop to the lower energy level, {{and there will be}} two photons of the same energy, where before there was only one. The repetition of this process is what leads to amplification, and since all of the photons are the same energy, the light produced is monochromatic.|$|E
