This {{model can}} be applied to an {{existing}} instruction set architecture incrementally by providing just five new instructions to implement concurrency controls. A set of microthreads is a static partition of a basic block into concurrently executing fragments, which execute on a single processor and share a <b>microcontext.</b> An iterator over a set provides a dynamic and parametric family of microthreads. Iterators capture loop concurrency and can be scheduled to different processors. An iterator over a set is created dynamically and is called a family of microthreads. This is the mechanism that allows the model to generate concurrency, which can be run on multiple processors or functional units.|$|E
40|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} that ‘context’ matters for development outcomes, yet we have little understanding of how exactly ‘context’ affects outcomes. This article focuses {{on the question of}} ‘context’ in social accountability (SA) initiatives by separating macro? and micro?contextual factors. On the macro side (country level), accountability processes need to take into account broad factors such as national histories of citizen–state engagement. On the micro side, local factors can drive the extent to which SA initiatives are successful, even within otherwise broadly similar national contexts. The article outlines the basic components of accountability and proposes a ‘causal chain'strategy to better understand the <b>micro?context.</b> This would allow existing evidence to be reorganised to assess the promise of existing and new initiatives by deconstructing the various mini?causal pathways (i. e. in the <b>micro?context)</b> and understanding the contextual conditions that make them work...|$|E
40|$|The methodological aim of {{the chapter}} is to propose a methodological {{framework}} that could be implemented to investigate the complex phenomenon of entrepreneurship and its embeddedness in a specific context. Under a theoretical point of view, the chapter highlights entrepreneurial practices that can sustain a new venture’s growth. Starting from the strong relationship between entrepreneurial activity and context, the contribute individuates {{in the concept of}} “entrepreneurial practice” that is the link between entrepreneurial agency and the <b>microcontext</b> of reference in a double causal relationship: the influence of the <b>microcontext</b> on entrepreneurial activity and, vice versa, the impact of institutional entrepreneurship on the context. The <b>microcontext</b> is defined here as the set of relationships in whose the entrepreneur is embedded. The aim of our research design is threefold: first of all we are interested in investigating the configuration of entrepreneurial practices, as defined in the Theoretical background, that lead to establish new ventures in a given contextual setting. The second issue we are dealing with is the analysis of practices that may lead to a new venture’s growth. In order to do that we need to define growth indicators that are suitable for new ventures and use them to select case studies to be included in our empirical analysis. We are interested both in successful and unsuccessful examples of new ventures because, as illustrated in the chapter, the concept of “success” in new venture could be strongly influenced by entrepreneur’s personal expectations. For these reasons growth is measured both at individual (as entrepreneur’s aspirations and motivations) and firm-level (in terms of traditional indicators of profitability and size). Finally we are interested in analyzing the impacts that entrepreneurial action could have on contextual change, as suggested by neo-institutional approach. The methodological approach chosen for investigating the above research issues is the narrative approach (Larty & Hamilton, 2011) that will allow us for recursively go back to the theory, in a reflective spiral (Anderson, Drakopoulos Dodd & Jack., 2010; Alvesson & Sköldberg, 2000) ...|$|E

40|$|Theoretical {{developments}} {{in the analysis of}} organizations have recently turned to an 'organizational becoming' perspective, which sees the social world as enacted in the <b>microcontext</b> of communicative interactions among individuals through which meaning is negotiated. According to this view, organizational change is endemic, natural, and ongoing; it occurs in everyday interactions as actors engage in the process of establishing new meanings for organizational activities. We adopt this approach to study how meanings were negotiated by senior and middle managers in a workshop held as part of a culture change program at a telecommunications company. Our study identifies two very different patterns in these negotiations, constituted by the particular communicative practices adopted by participants. We discuss the implications of these patterns for organizational change in relation to generative dialogue and power-resistance relations between senior and middle managers...|$|E

40|$|Introduction to this volume. The {{introduction}} {{provides a}} brief overview of English-medium instruction in Italy and Europe, highlighting the key issues. It then provides a summary of the volume chapters, bringing together key insights from the different contributions and the points they raise about this controversial issue in Italian higher education. English is increasingly used as a medium of instruction in European higher education not only in northern countries, but also in the European ‘south’. The introduction begins with an overview of EMI in Europe and the Italian context, and some of the arguments against the indiscriminate spread of English as a medium of instruction in higher education. It then summarises the chapters which focus on the <b>microcontext</b> of the university, giving voice to the various stakeholders in EMI. These include researchers, lecturers, administrative staff, those involved in professional development and students. The views and experiences of twelve EMI lecturers from a range of academic disciplines are analyzed and common themes which emerge from these chapters are highlighted...|$|E
40|$|Developmental {{contexts}} play {{a pivotal}} role in shaping the psychosocial adaptation and development of young people. Family, school, peer groups, and community provide the opportunities and constraints for the attainment of major developmental tasks of adolescence, and changing relations between the individual and these contexts constitute the basic process of human development. Furthermore, it is primarily through these immediate developmental contexts (microsystems in terms of ecological systems theory) that macrolevel trends such as globalization influence youth development. In this article, we illustrate how globalization and economic change have been reshaping the central <b>microcontexts</b> of adolescence. We then argue that the individual differences in the way youth perceive these changes and cope with themthat is, the active role individuals play in their own development - are the key to understanding the psychological consequences of social change...|$|R
40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the {{phenomenon}} of political modalization as an immanent feature of socio-political media discourse. Political modalization is not restricted to modality in the narrow, traditional sense and presupposes ideological interpretation of facts and events described in texts of the discourse in question. This interpretation can be directly contrary in oppositional discourses. Due to it contrast pictures {{of the world are}} created in the minds of recipients. Especially it concerns such modal objects as states. The article reveals linguistic means used for creating two images of America which stand in opposition to each other in American and Russian socio-political media discourses. These means include utterances with explicit evaluations (axiological means of modalization), <b>microcontexts</b> where the name of America is regularly used with names of negatively or positively evaluated phenomena (syntagmatic associative means of modalization) and conceptual metaphors with negative or positive connotations (metaphoric means of modalization). In American socio-political discourse these means help to represent the USA as an exceptional superpower playing the vital role in the struggle for freedom, justice and peace. In contrast to it Russian sociopolitical discourse represents America as an aggressive country which seeks to dominate the world through wars, threats, pressure on other countries. In this discourse America is associated with chaos, the unpredictability, avantyurizm, political deafness. It is concluded that political modalization is a powerful means of influence and effective means of its realization are worth studying...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this case study {{is to provide a}} working {{definition}} of effective language instruction consonant with the contemporary multicultural, university-level ESL classroom. Using a Grounded Theory methodology, it includes data from six months of teacher and student interviews, classroom observations, teacher evaluations, and questionnaires. Though attempts to categorize effective language instruction have been undertaken, previous taxonomies have been little more than altered models of teaching effectiveness from general education, offering little that is "new" or specific to the language teaching context. Furthermore, the shift from a teacher-centered to a student-centered classroom has not made great strides toward soliciting student input {{in the development of a}} contemporary definition of effectiveness. Thus, in approaching this working definition, I attempt to engage the fundamental principles of Critical Pedagogy to research by considering not only contemporary educational philosophy and the Communicative Approach to Language Teaching, but also students' needs and expectations based on their cultural and individual differences. Thus, the choice of pursuing a working definition rather than a definitive taxonomy emerges as a natural direction in the investigation. As it must be recognized that the <b>microcontexts</b> in the ESL classroom vary immensely in their makeup, the aim here is not to provide future second and foreign language teachers with a prescriptive formula, but rather a descriptive macroframework of domains which were abstracted and interpreted from the context of the ESL classroom. The qualitative, inductive case study approach used here enables teachers to identify elements derived from the organic data obtained in the classroom environment from its participants and apply it to their own situations. Thus, this framework can assist teachers in heightening their awareness and preparing them to participate effectively in a multicultural, university-level ESL classroom...|$|R

40|$|The present thesis {{addresses}} {{the relationship between}} the structure and social functions of language through the study of an Afro-Brazilian Portuguese speech community. The adopted methodological, analytical, and theoretical standpoints have their origin in linguistic anthropology, social psychology of language and discourse analysis. A set of data was collected during extensive fieldwork in Salvador (Brazil), and consists of recordings of informal conversations with and between followers of Candomblé, an Afro-Brazilian religion. Focusing on the communicative process in a specific communicative setting, the linguistic analyses illustrate the relationship between language and identity by examining theway in which expressions of African origin function as identity markers. In order to connect such Africanisms used by Candomblé followers in their everyday speech with the linguistic attitudes and ideologies found in Brazilian society throughout history, an interdisciplinary approach was called for and factors that affect the speech community’s ethnolinguistic vitality were explored. Linguistic attitudes and ideologies that have influenced group vitality were analyzed in the socio-political context (or macro-context). At the same time, the purpose was to understand communication within the sacred space of Candomblé by examining issues such as changes in linguistic forms and functions in the communicative situation (or <b>microcontext).</b> Apart from revealing patterns of communication in Candomblé communities, the results of the analyses show how linguistic changes such as re-Africanization are triggered by changes of attitudes in society. These changes affect speakers’ identities and language use within speech communities...|$|E

40|$|The {{violence}} {{staged by}} young people has often been subjected to scientific analysis. The way youths speak, in their role as aggressors or as victims, is examined to determine how they experience violence {{in a number of}} different spheres. Repeated group interviews are used to analyze how violence is explained and depicted within the family, at school and in the neighbourhood by two groups of young people (14 - 17 years old) attending the same school on the outskirts of Rio Claro, Sao Paulo, Brazil. One of the groups involved is identified by the school as violent, and the other, as non-violent. Discourse analysis leads to two conclusions. First, the different contexts of violence infuse a mistrust of institutions, the environment and personal relationships into the subjects' experience, forming a fabric that clouds future prospects. Second, the group of youths identified as violent have a more simplistic, pessimistic view of reality: They see the world in black and white, and they lay no stock in the possibility that violence can be avoided. Consequently, they use violence and understand violence as a defensive strategy that gives one identity. On the other hand, the group identified as nonviolent feels it possible to intervene in situations with nonviolent tools like words. For the young subjects, violence is a context that they assume; it cancels their ability to identify rules and institutions, but it does not generate an effective interaction strategy. Violence causes their social <b>microcontext</b> (in which action prevails over meaning or meaning equals action) to assume overblown dimensions. Any intervention strategy must take into account this indissoluble unity between meaning and action...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{aim was to}} investigate the policy-to-practice context to the delays and difficulties in the acquisition of speech, language and communication in the first five years in one local authority in England. Bronfenbrenner’s bioecological model was used to structure the thesis and as a tool of analysis. This facilitated an examination of the nested social contexts that influence children’s speech, language and communication such as policy intentions at the macro level and adult-child interactions in the <b>microcontext</b> of home and early years settings as well as relations between settings at the meso level and the local authority influence at the exo level. Successive stages of data collected have informed those that followed from analysis of policy documents to survey of and interviews with stakeholders such as early years practitioners, interviews with parents and observations of target children in early years settings. Analysis of policy texts revealed a gathering consensus on the importance of early years in children’s learning and development, future academic success and employability. The centrality of language, the effectiveness of early identification of children’s problems with speech, language and communication and early intervention to reduce or prevent later special educational needs and disabilities were highlighted. This study has highlighted the difficult and subjective nature of early identification and assessment and the wide variation in children’s early experiences, social interaction, speech, language and communication, socio-economic and socio-cultural environments. The benefits for children with speech, language and communication needs attending combined early years placements are exemplified. Children’s use of private speech has been an interesting finding. Practitioners from both mainstream and specialist settings {{would have liked to have}} more guidance on early identification and assessment in their initial training and would also like more training on ways to work with other professionals and to support children with English as an Additional Language. The study has enabled a distinctive model of bioecology for SLCN for birth to five years to be conceptualised. Challenges and opportunities for practitioners in supporting a diverse range of SLCN are discussed and the appropriateness and practicality of requiring generalist practitioners to undertake specialist roles is questioned...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{demonstrate}} the possibilities of application of the contextual approach, developed in pedagogy and psychology, in the process of literary analysis. Initially contextual approach was developed by A. A. Verbitsky as a methodology of education. A key category of this approach was the context, interpreted A. A. Verbitsky as a psychological phenomenon. Accordingly, in this paper on the basis of later research context is understood as a psychological mechanism of semantic, objectified in external forms of test patches, social and communicative situations, etc. Now contextual approach became general psychological methodology, which led to the possibility of its application in various fields of the humanities in particular – in psycholinguistic literary studies, where the notion of «context » is used in-depth psychological interpretation. Methods. The contextual approach developed by A. A. Verbitsky as the main component of methodology of education became the main instrument of the research stated in the publication. Besides a field of the general education, this approach is applicable to various private spheres – to educational aspect of education, and also to methodology of teaching various subject matters – mathematicians, biology, foreign languages, etc. The contextual approach at the level of allpsychological methodology has allowed to apply it in various fields of humanitarian knowledge, in particular in literary researches with a strongly pronounced psychological perspective. The contextual analysis corresponding to approach has been chosen as a method of work. Results. Based on A. A. Verbitsky’s interpretation and results of the latest researches the author shows that the context is a semantic mechanism, objectified in external forms of test fragments, social and communicative situations, etc. The following types of contexts are allocated: <b>microcontext</b> of a personality and works of an author, a mesocontext of socio-cultural influences, and also macrocontext of perception and interpretation of works in culture and science. The critical view of psychoanalysis as the literary criticism tool in the Russian culture is presented. Through the systematization of complementary contexts and psychoanalytic interpretation the myth about F. M. Dostoyevsky’s epilepsy as a source of his creativity is discredited; though by recognition of the writer, personal problems and neuroses nevertheless were reflected in his works. The hypothesis of the opposite influence of creativity of F. M. Dostoyevsky on S. Freud’s concept, i. e. formation of psychoanalysis under impact of art creativity is made. Scientific novelty. Methods of engaging of an intertextual and socio-cultural environment are known in linguistics and literary criticism long ago. However, diverse environments of existence of the personality and works of the artist as the unified system of contexts psychological in essence have not been considered yet. The novelty of the proposed way of a research consists in systematicity of formation of a complex of contexts of the studied phenomenon that makes it possible to correlate the diversified information through its origin. As a result, the researcher receives a number of complementary descriptions in the spirit of «the principle of a complementarity» by N. Bohr that provides dimensions and completeness of perception of the studied phenomenon. Practical significance of the work lies in the hard proof of the prospects of the contextual approach to interdisciplinary psychological and literary research. </p...|$|E
