Se han estudiado diferentes modelos de regresión entre la fecundidad parcial y el peso de las hembras sin ovarios. El mejor ajuste corresponde a una regresión lineal.

40|$|<b>Otter</b> <b>trawling</b> {{has been}} the {{prevalent}} method of ground fishing in Atlantic Canada. Despite this, {{little is known about}} associated impacts to benthic habitat and communities. This thesis examines the impacts of <b>otter</b> <b>trawling</b> on bivalves living in sand, a bottom type occurring widely over the Grand Banks. Bivalves are dominant members of sandy bottoms on continental shelves and are good indicators of physical disturbance. Two broad categories of impacts to benthos from mobile fishing gear are direct harvest and incidental damage. Bivalves have low susceptibility to capture by groundfish <b>otter</b> trawls; <b>trawl</b> capture efficiency is on the order of 10 ⁻⁵. In order to investigate incidental impacts, a three-year <b>otter</b> <b>trawling</b> experiment was conducted on a fine to medium sand bottom on the northeastern Grand Bank. Each year a total of 12 trawl passes were made along the centre line of two 13 km by 200 m experimental corridors. Sampling was conducted inside experimental and adjacent reference corridors with a 0. 5 m² hydraulic grab. No significant effects of trawling were detected on bivalve populations in any year. Shallow burrowing species showed no significant changes in density or biomass and recruitment of juveniles ≤ 3 mm was apparent inside trawled corridors. The size structure of populations from trawled and reference areas were similar. Mean (± sd) percent major shell damage immediately after trawling was low, ranging from 2. 8 ± 6. 1 % to 13. 5 + 9. 4 %. Trawl doors are the most destructive gear component of <b>otter</b> <b>trawls.</b> A physical trawl door model was towed through an artificial sand testbed, constructed to resemble an offshore seabed. Although bivalves within the scour path were displaced, levels of damage were low (c. 5 %), similar to levels of damage from the combined effects of all gear components recorded in the field experiment. The anomaly of displacement, accompanied by few instances of damage, is explained by sediment mechanics associated with scouring and size and life position of infaunal bivalves. Compared to natural sediment-mediated disturbances, <b>otter</b> <b>trawling</b> can be manipulated over a wide range of frequencies.

Spatial comparisons were assessed by dividing the Bay in two zones for the beach seines (inner and outer Bay) and three zones for the <b>otter</b> <b>trawl</b> (inner, central and outer Bay), following depth, salinity and transparency gradient, {{as well as for}} the influence of the sea. Beach seines (30 m extension, a 10 m length x 2. 5 m of height x 7 mm mesh) and <b>otter</b> <b>trawls</b> were used. Trawls covered 1. 5 km and the boat (net mouth 8 m, mesh size 12 mm between opposites knots in the cod). Temperature (oC) and salinity (p. s. u.) were taken in each sampling; depth (m) and transparency (m) were meas-ured during the trawl. Fish from beach seine were basically young-of-the-year; in the trawl they were individu-als of larger size with total length varying from 70 mm to 300 mm. Spatially, highest CPUEs were found for the continental margin in the inner Bay, and for the inside Bay, in the inner and central zones. Highly significant cor-relations were detected among M. furnieri abundance and low salinity, transparency and depth in the inner Bay, with no defined pattern for the continental margin. Temporally, differences in fish abundance were shown only for the second annual cycle (1996) for the continental margin, with peaks in September/October...|$|R

40|$|Demands for {{management}} advice on mixed and multispecies fisheries pose many challenges, {{further complicated by}} corresponding requests for advice on {{the environmental impacts of}} alternate management options. Here, we develop, and apply to North Sea fisheries, a method for collectively assessing the effects of, and interplay between, technical interactions, multispecies interactions, and the environmental effects of fishing. Ecological interactions involving 21 species are characterized with an ensemble of 188 plausible parameterizations of size-based multispecies models, and four fleets (beam <b>trawl,</b> <b>otter</b> <b>trawl,</b> industrial, and pelagic) characterized with catch composition data. We use the method to evaluate biomass and economic yields, alongside the risk of stock depletion and changes in the value of community indicators, for 10 000 alternate fishing scenarios (combinations of rates of fishing mortality F and fleet configuration) and present the risk vs. reward trade-offs. Technical and multispecies interactions linked to the beam and <b>otter</b> <b>trawl</b> fleets were predicted to have the strongest effects on fisheries yield and value, risk of stock collapse and fish community indicators. Increasing beam trawl effort led to greater increases in beam <b>trawl</b> yield when <b>otter</b> <b>trawl</b> effort was low. If <b>otter</b> <b>trawl</b> effort was high, increases in beam trawl effort led to reduced overall yield. Given the high value of demersal species, permutations of fleet effort leading to high total yield (generated primarily by pelagic species) were not the same as permutations leading to high catch values. A transition from F for 1990 to 2010 to FMSY, but without changes in fleet configuration, reduced risk of stock collapse without affecting long-term weight or value of yield. Our approach directly addresses the need for assessment methods that treat mixed and multispecies issues collectively, address uncertainty, and take account of trade-offs between weight and value of yield, state of stocks and state of the environment...|$|R

This study investigated the four gear types most commonly used by fishers and researchers to determine whether their catches {{are representative of the}} populations.

Both the seine net and <b>otter</b> <b>trawl</b> caught a wide size range of crabs, although most of the catch was larger than the size at sexual maturity. The sex ratio of crabs caught by these two gear types was close to parity. However, traps caught a narrow size range, almost all of the catch were larger than the size at sexual maturity, and catches were heavily biased towards large males. Therefore, although favored by commercial fishers and for sampling crustacean populations in sensitive and protected areas, trap catches are not representative of the population sampled for blue swimmer crabs. Seine nets or <b>otter</b> <b>trawls</b> should thus be considered in the research assessment of stocks as their catches are more representative of the population. Catchability of all four gear types was found to vary seasonally. The size and sex bias of trap catches appear to be attributable to behavioural differences...|$|R

Sampling was performed under normal fishing activities in 21 <b>otter</b> <b>trawl</b> hauls and 62 set nets operations. One hundred thirty-two invertebrate species were altogether discarded in medium and small scale fishery over the study area, classified in 16 classes and 7 phyla. Small scale fisheries yielded almost 70 % of the total invertebrate diversity, while <b>otter</b> <b>trawling</b> only 50 %. Molluscs were the most diverse group in both fisheries followed by crustaceans and echinoderms. Multivariate analysis revealed a clear differentiation in discard species composition between the two fisheries reflecting different benthic habitats. According to the species composition of the discards certain benthic biocoenoses were identified. The Coastal terrigenous muds biocoenosis prevailed in medium scale fishing areas, accompanied by the Coastal detritic, Muddy detritic, and Bathyal mud biocoenoses. Several plant-dominated communities (mostly those of Infralittoral photophilus algae, Circalittoral sciaphilus algae, and Posidonia meadows), were recognized through small scale fishery discards. The higher diversity of the latter was attributed to the great variety of habitats and established communities in the relevant fishing grounds. These results show that invertebrate discards could contribute background data for monitoring the complex benthic system...|$|R
