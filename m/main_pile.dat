40|$|This {{paper is}} based on the Masters Thesis work {{conducted}} by D. Ph. Pocobelli in Sapienza University of Rome in 2014. Although the Aghios Konstantinos Church is currently under restoration processes, this research took place before the restoration of the dome, now finalised. Aghios Konstantinos Church was designed by architect Lysandros Kaftantzoglou {{at the end of the}} 19 th century. It was being built for more than 20 years, and it was completed after its author‟s death. The main façade is characterised by three different levels: the ground floor, the mezzanine or gynaecium, and the dome. The inner space is organised into three naves and a transept; the intersection between the central nave and the transept is covered by the dome. The church has suffered severe damages caused mainly by two strong earthquakes that took place in the surroundings of Athens. The first earthquake occurred in 1981 in Alkyonides Islands, with a magnitude of 6, 6 Richter. The second one happened in 1999 in Ano Liosia, with a magnitude of 5, 5 Richter. These events provoked major structural damages, concentrated on the dome, the <b>main</b> <b>piles</b> and the arches supporting the vault. On top of that, major fractures were also caused by the weight of the dome itself, that has been built with greater dimensions and heavier materials than the ones originally calculated by Kaftantzoglou. The piles have deep horizontal fractures on their bases, and superficial diagonal fractures under the cornice. The arches supporting the vault have transversal fractures that become deeper in correspondence of the keystone. Finally, the dome reveals a continuous horizontal fracture on the tambour, and vertical cracks that run from the architraves upwards. The interventions proposed in this paper are a Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) hooping for the dome and stainless steel chaining bars for the arches...|$|R

This structure {{is inspired by}} the Guggenheim museum of New York and is designed to protect a land-mark palm-tree from wind loads. This six – trunk palm tree was declared monument by the Valencian government in 2012. The structure that now protect it appears to fly around de palm tree creating a helicoidally skywalk made of steel, while retrofitting the lateral trunks of the tree {{to protect them from}} collapse. An 18 m. long straight beam starts on the top of this helix, and stretches towards a lookout point that offers a view of the whole village and its surroundings. The reduction of the visual impact of the structure on the tree was a major aim for the project design. The structural elements are as slender as possible to avoid the visual obstruction of tree. They are painted white, while the walkway steel corrugated plate is painted green in order to highlight its neat shape among the blur created by the apparent mess of bars of the supporting structure.

40|$|The jacket, or template, {{structures}} {{are still the}} most common offshore structures used for drilling and production. Some structures contain enlarged legs, which are suitable for self-buoyancy during its installation at the site. Fixed jacket structures consist of tubular members interconnected to form a three-dimensional space frame. Hence, the jacket structure can be categorized into a column structure. These structures usually have four to eight legs battered to achieve stability against not only toppling in waves but also axial compressive loads. <b>Main</b> <b>piles</b> which are tubular are usually carried with the jackets and driven through the jacket legs into the seafloor. The piles bear the axial compressive loads due to the component of the main deck and these loads are distributed to all the jacket legs. The configuration of a typical member on the jacket structure has significant influence to buckling strength. Horizontal and diagonal braces {{play an important role}} to resist the axial compressive load on the jacket legs. Although only the axial load acts on the jacket legs, the local and global deformation of the structural member due to this load must be taken into account. This paper discusses the configuration effect of the symmetrical and asymmetrical shape in buckling strength analysis on the fixed jacket offshore platform. Two kinds of fixed jacket offshore {{structures are}} taken as the object of the analysis. Only the axial load is considered and it is applied both two structures. The material and dimensions of the two structures are assumed to be constant and homogenous. The crack extension and corrosion are not considered in the analysis. To assess the buckling strength of these structures due to the configuration of symmetrical and asymmetrical shape, the Finite Element Method (FEM) is used. As a fundamental case, the buckling strength analysis is performed on these structures by taking two dimensional planes (2 D) into consideration to obtain the critical buckling load for local deformation of the structural member. The result obtained by FEA is compared with the analytical solution and the applicability of the FEM is further applied to investigate for the global structural deformation...|$|R

We investigated what factors determine which social insect workers respond to colony-level changes in task demand. We used radio-frequency identification technology to compare the roles of corpulence, age, spatial location and previous activity (intra-nest/extra-nest) in determining whether worker ants (Temnothorax albipennis) respond {{to an increase in}} demand for foraging or brood care. The less corpulent ants took on the extra foraging, irrespective of their age, previous activity or location in the nest, supporting a physiological threshold model. We found no relationship between ants that tended the extra brood and corpulence, age, spatial location or previous activity, but ants that transported the extra brood to the <b>main</b> brood <b>pile</b> were less corpulent and had high previous intra-nest activity. This supports spatial task-encounter and physiological threshold models for brood transport. Our data suggest a flexible task-allocation system allowing the colony to respond rapidly to changing needs, using a simple task-encounter system for generalized tasks, combined with physiologically based response thresholds for more specialized tasks. This could provide a social insect colony with a robust division of labour, flexibly allocating the workforce in response to current needs...|$|R
40|$|A magnetostratigraphic {{investigation}} of the Permian Emeishan LIP (large igneous province) was carried out on a composite section in Ebian County, close to the type area in Sichuan, SW China. The main succession of twelve flows (175 m thick) carries a normal polarity whilst the one reliable site from the overlying 30 m thick volcanic waning sequence {{is marked by a}} reverse polarity. The data enable a correlation to be proposed with an Emeishan Basalt sequence in western Guizhou, c. 400 km to the SE. From our knowledge of the geomagnetic field's reversal behaviour during the Permian, it suggests that the <b>main</b> lava <b>pile</b> along the eastern half of the Emeishan Basalt outcrop belt was erupted within a half to one million years. Using magnetobiostratigraphic data from the adjacent South China platform, the normal polarity magnetozone is correlated with the normal polarity chron associated with {{the upper part of the}} Maokou Limestones. Constrained by conodont data, the main Emei Basalts appear to be at least two biozones older (1 - 1. 5 Ma) than the Mid-Late Permian boundary. It is possible, however, that the Emei Basalt waning zone sequence, which represents an explosive volcanic phase, might be coeval with the 'end-Guadalupian' biotic crisis. Thus arguments implicating Emei Basalt volcanism as the causal mechanism behind this major global event have to accommodate the new relative-age constraints. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
500|$|The fourth {{phase of}} {{activity}} began one {{million years ago}} when the Cordilleran Ice Sheet retreated from the upper flanks of the adjacent lava plateau, creating Mount Edziza proper which is the most northerly of the four central volcanoes. It is a steep-sided stratovolcano and the largest and highest of the peaks that form the volcanic complex with an elevation of , overlapping the northern flank of Ice Peak. The stratovolcano is made up of a fine-grained volcanic rock called trachyte and is associated with several lava domes which were formed by trachyte lava flows and explosive eruptions. Its smooth northern and western flanks, only slightly channeled by erosion, curve up to a circular [...] summit ridge which surrounds a central, ice-filled caldera [...] in diameter. Many glaciers cover Mount Edziza proper, including the Tencho Glacier on its southern flank.

Through critical reading, researchers understand the core concepts and being able to compare, contrast, and compose the new main themes of the literatures into thesis writing. Being able to write a good literature review is vital not only to show researchers’ own understanding of the field but also to support the creative research design.

40|$|Extreme folding {{damage of}} {{open-ended}} tubular piles could occur during piling in onshore practices. Amazonehaven unique quay wall removal gave {{the opportunity to}} study king pile’s failure close to toe. King piles are primary piles in a combined wall system, exposed to static and dynamic load. It is argued that the unexpected pile toe failure {{have been caused by}} dynamic load because of the uniaxial direction of the extreme deformations. However, research into pile toe failure in Amazonehaven shows that hammer-induced driving stresses are significantly lower than material’s yield stress close to pile toe, given Amazonehaven soil condition. Therefore, the dynamic load has not been solely detrimental to the pile toe integrity. The <b>main</b> reasons for <b>pile</b> toe failure are discussed to be (1) pile imperfection, (2) pile inclination and (3) pile inhomogeneous strength. Bear in mind that, pile toe failure to such extent when not limited might lead to dysfunction of the asset during its technical lifetime. Therefore, counteractions must be taken to assure quay wall’s safety and stability while operating. The remedies when such a piling risk event occur could be: replacement, early maintenance, or a reduction in its designed storage capacity. The reactive solutions will bring financial consequences of pile toe failure forward. In other words, the client will experience a reduction in its revenues due to asset’s malfunction. However, when proactive process-based alternatives are implemented in the current procedure in piling industry, the probability of occurrence of the failure is to be reduced. Therefore, financial consequences of piling risk event will remain limited.

40|$|This study {{comprises}} three <b>main</b> parts: (1) <b>Pile</b> Driving Analysis. The conventional {{one dimensional}} wave equation {{analysis of the}} pile driving problem suffers from the empirical representation of the soil parameters. In this study, an improved one dimensional wave equation model is developed which accounts for wave propagation in the soil mass and thus gives more realistic prediction of the pile displacements. A three dimensional finite element analysis {{of the problem is}} also formulated and its results are compared with those of the one dimensional analysis. The finite element analysis is computationally very expensive which is not justified due to its sensitivity to the input parameters. (2) Modelling of Wave Forces. Lack of spatial correlation of short crested waves is accounted for using a coherence function model and the wave forces estimated using this model are compared with those estimated using the directional spectrum model. Both models are found to give comparable resultant wave forces and their attenuation with separation if their parameters are properly chosen. The error resulting from assuming a constant water particle velocity along the tributary length is examined and appears to be small. (3) Response of Fixed Offshore Towers to Random Wave Forces Accounting for Pile-Soil-Pile Interaction. Dynamic pile-soil-pile interaction under the effect of wave forces is usually neglected in the design of offshore towers. It is examined and found to {{have a significant effect on}} the response of the tower to random waves. It is incorporated in the analysis using dynamic interaction factors which consider pile-soil separation. The response of the tower is found to be greatly influenced by pile-soil-pile interaction which is attributed to the increase in flexibility and damping of the tower...|$|R
40|$|The largest {{part of an}} ice ridge {{consists}} of unconsolidated ice rubble, whose material properties decide the load from ridges on ships and structures. Material resistance is attributed to the initial freeze-bonds and the friction and interlocking between blocks. The objective of the thesis was to investigate rubble behaviour by two tests: shear box test at NTNU and pile test at HSVA. The shear box test was aimed at investigating freeze-bond mechanisms in rubble. The pile test was aimed at suggesting values for rubble properties for a model scale experiment. The shear box had dimensions 600 mm x 400 mm x 40 mm, and was filled with ice blocks of 60 mm x 22 mm x 40 mm simulating rubble. Confinement was added, the box was submerged for 10 minutes, and tested in a rig by forcing the rubble to fail in shear. Force vs. displacement was measured. Different types of saline ice and submerging water temperatures were used. Pile testing consisted of making an elongated pyramid-shaped pile, baseline 600 mm, of rubble collected from the ice tank at HSVA. The pile was tilted and geometry was measured before and after failure happened in the <b>pile.</b> <b>Main</b> results from the shear box tests were the observation of a first phase deformation of rubble, that displayed a near linear force-displacement relation and a first peak shear stress. Magnitude of first peaks was measured in the range 8. 9 kPa to 59. 7 kPa, and depended on submersion water temperature, salinity of ice, how blocks were cut in respect to crystal structure in the ice sheet and confining pressure. Pile tests had repose angles ranging from 36. 0 &# 176; to 47. 3 &# 176;, and cohesion for an assumed angle of friction of 30 &# 176; was {{in the range of}} 172 Pa to 342 Pa. First phase shear stress was compared to shear strength of single freeze-bond tests of the same ice, and direct relations were found. The magnitude of first peak shear stress in tests varied most with ice salinity and crystal structure. The measured repose angles for pile tests give an upper limit for internal angles of friction, and values seemed reasonable. The ice was warm, and this may the reason for the low cohesions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Sheth misreads key {{aspects of}} my earlier comment. For the record: I {{consider}} ‘uplift’ an issue central to the plume debate. I reiterate; uplift ‘remains a polemic issue’, (i. e. worthy of discussion). Word limits preclude the desired detailed dialogue, but some important issues are raised below. I entirely agree that concerted field work is necessary, but both this paper and Sheth (2005) offer little new field data, and instead rely largely upon an interpretation of previous authors’ information. Such retrospectives do not permit the reader to evaluate {{the relative merits of}} plume versus non-plume models, and so cannot materially progress debate. The argument regarding southward (not eastward, as suggested by Sheth) younging of the main Deccan edifice remains robust. Three independent lines of geological evidence support this interpretation: Two independent lines are usually deemed sufficient to indicate a scientific ‘truth’. Sheth concludes, logically, that Western Ghats is the product of post-Deccan denudational processes. This particular interpretation has long been available (e. g. Widdowson and Cox, 1996; Widdowson, 1997; Gunnell and Fleitout, 1998; Widdowson and Mitchell, 1999). Given this issue is not in dispute, why raise it here? Sheth asserts that Cox’s (1989) plume-head drainage idea is problematic. Perhaps, but the fact that radial drainage patterns do occur in key CFBPs remains a valid, if inexplicable (?) observation. Cox’s idea was superseded by arguments provided in Widdowson and Cox (1996), Widdowson (1997; see fig. 14), and AFTA data (Gunnell et al., 2003), and so becomes irrelevant for contending pre-eruptive uplift. Sheth argues, correctly, that the nature of the pre-Deccan palaeosurface holds important clues regarding pre-eruptive uplift in the DVP (Jerram and Widdowson, 2005). Much of this surface remains buried by the Deccan lavas, and is both inaccessible and unknowable. It only becomes exposed around the northern and eastern periphery of the <b>main</b> lava <b>pile.</b> Such peripheral localities, including many of those described by Sheth, were hundreds of kilometres from the Deccan eruptive loci. If any uplift did occur here, it would have been minimal at such large distances from the focus of putative plume head uplift, and thus consistent with that affecting the Dongargaon basin, for example (Tandon, 2002; Samant and Mohabey 2005). The pre-eruptive palaeosurface has been significantly modified by the crustal loading of the Deccan edifice, and in its western extensions suppressed far below datum. Thus, the gross form and elevation of this basement – basalt contact is largely an artefact of post-eruptive flexural adjustment. Nevertheless, Sheth argues that this highly modified surface reveals a ‘peneplain’, and that its preservation as such precludes significant fluvial incision. Possibly: But peneplains are the consequence of erosion, and the classical, albeit obsolete, Davisian model requires regional uplift as a trigger for peneplanation to proceed. Etchplanation is more appropriate {{to the development of the}} pre-Deccan surface (e. g. Büdel, 1982). Here, thick alteration mantles accumulate through tropical weathering of surfaces exposed during prolonged periods of tectonic stability. If, as Sheth requires, such conditions had characterised the pre-Deccan land surface, then the widespread absence of deep weathering mantle preserved beneath the lava units may instead indicate that this landscape had been thoroughly stripped prior to DVP eruptions. Etchplain stripping may be achieved through widespread fluvial erosion induced by regional uplift (Borger and Widdowson, 2001). Offshore sedimentary records in the Krishna, Godavari, and Narmada-Tapti basins, all reveal significant increases in Late Cretaceous depositional flux (Halkett et al. 2001) : these data are consistent with pre-eruptive regional erosion of peninsular India – starting with the stripping of an easily erodable weathering mantle perhaps? If pre-eruptive (plume-driven?) uplift had occurred in pre-Deccan peninsular India, what might then be recorded in the erosional and sedimentary chronologies of the DVP peripheral regions? Removal of any easily erodable weathering mantle, perhaps; minimal changes in elevation, possibly; development of shallow basins receiving fine clastic input from the plume-uplift effects hundreds of kilometres away - may be. This interpretation of the available infra- and intra-trappean sedimentary (i. e. Lameta Beds) data is equally plausible using the same compendium of field evidence provided by Sheth. Accordingly, I offer a modified, précis version of Sheth’s own summary: ‘Any original flatness and elevation of the pre-Deccan landscape has been significantly modified by syn- and post-eruptive isostatic adjustment deriving, initially, from the loading of the DVP edifice, and subsequently by denudational unloading. The occurrence of a stripped, pre-eruptive etchplain, together with associated offshore sedimentological data, are consistent with those phenomena predicted had a large plume head upwelled beneath India during the Late Cretaceous. Post-Deccan uplift has elevated both the pre-Deccan, and post-Deccan surfaces. This uplift of the Western Ghats is not related to a putative Deccan plume: it is not domal, occurs beyond the limits off the Deccan lava cover, and represents a later, denudationally-driven, uplift (Widdowson, 1997). Thus, the easterly drainage of the Indian peninsula is not plume-related dome flank drainage, and is largely antecedent to denudational uplift effects’. To summarise, of those observations described by Sheth, most, if not all, can equally and adequately be explained by the passage of India over a static, spatially restricted, mantle melting anomaly during the Late Cretaceous: For want of a better term, and until consensus offers me a better alternative, I will continue to call this anomaly, sensu lato, a ‘mantle plume’. I end by reiterating the rationale to my initial comment: The challenge to Sheth remains to deliver us an alternative, ‘non plume’, model that can better explain the Deccan CFBP. ...|$|R
