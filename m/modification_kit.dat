Riddle subsequently converted its own fleet of 32 to have 2,100 hp Pratt & Whitney engines. This conversion was {{also referred to}} as the Super 46C.|$|E
25|$|Weapons and Tactics Package (3 weeks) – Involves 5000-8000 rounds {{fired from}} the M4 carbine {{equipped}} with a Special Operations Peculiar <b>Modification</b> <b>kit</b> and the MEU(SOC) Pistol (.45 ACP). A live fire and maneuvering exercise in immediate action (IA) drills within close range of rotary wing support, as well as transportation, is conducted on the third week. As the Marines become familiar with their weapons, they conduct field exercise, force-on-force, live-fire drills using a militarized version of the Simunitions kit called the Special Effects Small Arms Marking Systems, or SESAMS. The Marking Cartridge ammunition contains a sabot and a small, plastic round encasing a colored detergent or paint, usually red or blue.|$|E

2500|$|Many Ju-88C's {{had their}} Bola gondolas {{modified}} {{to hold up}} to two forward firing 20mm cannon. Several C-6 night fighters were equipped with two [...] "Schräge-Musik" [...] upward-firing 20mm cannon in trial fittings, and from mid 1943 onward, there was an official field <b>modification</b> <b>kit</b> available for this arrangement.|$|E
2500|$|Surveillance {{was carried}} out by six {{horizontal}} beams over the Kapustin Yar area. In 1958 a second antenna, [...] high by [...] long (called the Cinerama antenna), and new 1.2-megawatt transmitters were installed as part of a <b>modification</b> <b>kit</b> which provided three additional horizontal beams, a seven-beam vertical fan, and greater range capability.|$|E
2500|$|Despite these modifications, the P-51Bs and P-51Cs, and {{the newer}} P-51Ds and P-51Ks, {{experienced}} low-speed handling problems {{that could result}} in an involuntary [...] "snap-roll" [...] under certain conditions of air speed, angle of attack, gross weight, and center of gravity. Several crash reports tell of P-51Bs and P-51Cs crashing because horizontal stabilizers were torn off during maneuvering. As a result of these problems, a <b>modification</b> <b>kit</b> consisting of a dorsal fin was manufactured. One report stated: ...|$|E
50|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{aftermarket}} <b>modification</b> <b>kits</b> are offered for the 10/22, including conversions to bullpup configuration and cosmetic alterations to replicate the appearance of weapons like the M1 Carbine, Thompson submachine gun, AR-15, and AK-47.|$|R
50|$|The Utility Set {{had limited}} {{reception}} on medium wave and lacked a longwave band {{to simplify the}} design. The tuning scale listed only BBC stations. After the war a version with LW was made available and <b>modification</b> <b>kits</b> to retrofit existing sets were marketed.|$|R
5000|$|Micro AeroDynamics markets vortex {{generator}} <b>modification</b> <b>kits</b> for [...] "STOL benefits". The Micro kits are small {{vortex generator}}s that are {{glued to the}} wing leading edge, {{as well as the}} underside of the elevator and on the fin. Kits are available for a large number of light aircraft types.|$|R
2500|$|Also in 2015, Airbus flight {{tested a}} package of {{aerodynamic}} upgrades for the Eurofighter known as the Aerodynamic <b>Modification</b> <b>Kit</b> (AMK) that included fuselage strakes and leading-edge root extensions which increases wing lift by 25% resulting in an increased turn rate, tighter turning radius, and improved nose-pointing ability at low speed with angle of attack values around 45% greater than on the standard aircraft and roll rates up to 100% higher. Eurofighter's Laurie Hilditch said these improvements should increase subsonic turn rate by 15% and give the Eurofighter the sort of [...] "knife-fight in a phone box" [...] turning capability enjoyed by rivals such as Boeing’s F/A-18E/F or the Lockheed Martin F-16, without sacrificing the transonic and supersonic high-energy agility inherent to its delta wing-canard configuration.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} Corsair {{was developed}} into the Conquest I by customer {{demand for more}} cabin space and a higher maximum takeoff weight. Cessna worked on upgrades that would allow more cabin space and passengers. Essentially, the upgrades increased maximum takeoff weight. The Cessna 441 had previous been called the Conquest, but was renamed the Conquest II. Earlier model Corsairs can be upgraded to Conquest I standard with factory provided <b>modification</b> <b>kits.</b>|$|R
50|$|Founded in the 1960s by {{aeronautical}} engineer Chris Falconar, the company {{created a new}} aircraft fabric process called Hipec. The company also acquired a large list of aircraft designs that were either orphaned, like the Fauvel AV.36 glider or long out of production and added their own designs to the line. The company provides plans and kits for all their designs as well as parts and <b>modification</b> <b>kits</b> for other aircraft, including the Ercoupe.|$|R
5000|$|On 22 January 2010, Trijicon {{announced}} it would stop the practice of engraving Biblical references on products sold to the government. It also offered to provide <b>modification</b> <b>kits</b> {{for the purpose of}} removing such engravings on sights already produced and sold to the military. In a statement, the company said it was both [...] "prudent and appropriate" [...] to remove the engravings. Trijicon's consumer products are still engraved with Biblical references in accordance with company tradition.|$|R

50|$|The {{design of}} the {{standard}} dance platform allocates for each panel {{to be at the}} same height, with a small gap between each panel. Experienced arcade players often dislike the flat feel. The black panel <b>modification</b> <b>kit</b> that Cobalt Flux produces attempts to simulate arcade-style inset arrow panels.|$|E
2500|$|After an investigation, it was {{determined}} that a design flaw with the engine air particle separator (EAPS) caused it to jam in flight, causing a shock wave in the hydraulics system and subsequent leaks. [...] Hydraulic fluid leaked into the IR suppressors and was the cause of the nacelle fires. As a result, all Block-A V-22 aircraft were placed under flight restrictions until <b>modification</b> <b>kits</b> could be installed. [...] No fielded Marine MV-22s were affected, as those Block-B aircraft already incorporated the modification.|$|R
50|$|American Airlines was {{the launch}} customer. Eastern Air Lines, Braniff Airways and Northwest Airlines followed. The Electra {{suffered}} a troubled start. Passengers of early aircraft complained of {{noise in the}} cabin forward of the wings, caused by propeller resonance. Lockheed redesigned the engine nacelles, tilting the engines upwards three degrees. The changes were incorporated on the production line by mid-1959 or as <b>modification</b> <b>kits</b> for the aircraft already built, and resulted in improved performance and a better ride for passengers.|$|R

A Foreign Military Sales contract for 68 F-15S to F-15SA <b>modification</b> <b>kits</b> was placed with Boeing in June 2012. First flight of a new-build F-15SA occurred on 20 February 2013.|$|R
50|$|Construction of the Beechcraft Model 18 {{ended in}} 1970 {{with a final}} Model H18 going to Japan Airlines. Through the years, 32 {{variations}} of the basic design had flown, over 200 improvement <b>modification</b> <b>kits</b> were developed, and almost 8,000 aircraft were built. In one case, the aircraft was modified to a triple tail, trigear, humpbacked configuration and appeared similar to a miniature Lockheed Constellation. Another distinctive conversion {{was carried out by}} PacAero as the Tradewind. This featured a lengthened nose to accommodate the tricycle nosewheel, and the Model 18's twin tailfins were replaced by a single fin.|$|R

5000|$|A popular {{modification}} for the flathead was {{conversion to}} an overhead-valve configuration, and many such <b>modification</b> <b>kits</b> were available, including the Ardun heads from Zora Arkus-Duntov {{who was to}} go on to fame as the [...] "father of the Corvette". These conversions were not initially demanded by hot rodders looking for extra power, as they had not yet exhausted the capabilities of the flathead configuration, but were demanded by users of the engine in trucks and other such high load applications, where the constant flow of hot exhaust through the block to the exhaust manifolds caused the entire engine to overheat; the overhead-valve heads routed the exhaust out more directly, and away from the block.|$|R
