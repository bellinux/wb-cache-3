50|$|The {{choice of}} the main type of memory used in the TXE2 (and the TXE4) was {{particularly}} characteristic of the general design philosophy, that the components used had to be of a technology that had been tested over many years. The choice thus went to the 'Dimond ring' type of memory, named after T. L. Dimond of Bell Laboratories, who invented them in 1945. They were large-diameter <b>magnetic</b> <b>ferrite</b> toroidal rings with solenoid windings, through which are threaded writing and reading wires. This set-up is shown fairly clearly in the picture (above) of the Ambergate Calling Number Generator (CNG) and Class of Service (COS) racks.

In {{order to}} develop magnetic logic, Crane controlled the direction of bit flow in <b>magnetic</b> <b>ferrite</b> memory cores. Ferrite logic circuits are inherently more stable than vacuum tubes and transistors, draw no power when unused, and are impervious to electromagnetic interference. In 1959, Crane introduced the all-magnetic logic approach at the Fall Joint Computer Conference, eventually leading to {{a demonstration of the}} world's first all-magnetic computer in 1961. The technology was soon commercialized by Aircraft Marine Products (AMP) Inc., under license from SRI, and used primarily in the rapid transit system of New York City and at railroad switching yards, where electro-magnetic interference made electronic computers unfeasible. The development and growth of planar transistors in silicon chips and integrated circuits displaced magnetic core logic, although it may still be useful for extended space missions and other extreme conditions, but using integrated circuit manufacturing techniques (e.g. etching and deposition of a substrate, and not an assembly of discrete magnetic cores). The prototype of the first all-magnetic computer now resides at the Computer History Museum, in Mountain View, California.|$|E

The uneven distribution of MWNTs and rGO-Fe 3 O 4 in the blends, which acted as micro-absorbers resulted in outstanding electromagnetic wave absorption (93 %). Various parameters like transmission coefficient, attenuation constant and skin depth were assessed for {{a clear understanding}} of the attenuation mechanism in each of the blends containing different nano-inclusions like MWNTs and Fe 3 O 4, only rGO-Fe 3 O 4 and a combination of MWNTs and rGO-Fe 3 O 4. It is understood that the absorption was significantly enhanced due to selective localization of nano-inclusions in the PC phase that provided heterogeneous dielectric media with multiple interfaces. The penetration of the high frequency electromagnetic waves into the shield was facilitated by high surface resistivity and high volume electrical conductivity (5 S cm(- 1)). Further, in combination with lossy nano-inclusions the incoming EM radiation was attenuated through multiple scattering. This is realized in the blends containing both MWNTs and rGO-Fe 3 O 4 which manifested in a total shielding effectiveness of - 50. 7 dB (at 18 GHz), indicating > 99. 9 % attenuation of the incoming microwave radiation, in striking contrast to blends containing either only MWNTs or only rGO-Fe 3 O 4.
