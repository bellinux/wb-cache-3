5|$|Evidence for the T cell-mediated {{mechanism}} of mucosal destruction is strong, but the exact triggers for this process are unknown and {{are thought to}} be <b>multiple</b> <b>and</b> varied from one person to the next. This suggests {{that there are a number}} of possible triggers, each of which is capable of producing the disease in different subgroups. In other words, different subgroups appear to have different causes for the condition. These can be considered in three general groups, namely primary immuno-dysregulation, decrease of the mucosal barrier and states of heightened antigenic sensitivity (see below). Risk factors in aphthous stomatitis are also sometimes considered as either host-related or environmental.|$|E
5|$|Impact {{events are}} {{continually}} occurring on the lunar surface. The most common events are {{those associated with}} micrometeorites, as might be encountered during meteor showers. Impact flashes from such events have been detected from <b>multiple</b> <b>and</b> simultaneous Earth-based observations. Tables of impacts recorded by video cameras exist for years since 2005 {{many of which are}} associated with meteor showers. Furthermore, impact clouds were detected following the crash of ESA's SMART-1 spacecraft, India's Moon Impact Probe and NASA's LCROSS. Impact events leave a visible scar on the surface, and these could be detected by analyzing before and after photos of sufficiently high resolution. No impact craters formed between the Clementine (global resolution 100 metre, selected areas 7-20 metre) and SMART-1 (resolution 50 metre) missions have been identified.|$|E
5|$|Prefixes {{are added}} to unit names to produce <b>multiple</b> <b>and</b> sub-multiples of the {{original}} unit. All multiples are integer powers of ten, and above a hundred or below a hundredth all are integer powers of a thousand. For example, kilo- denotes a multiple of a thousand and milli- denotes a multiple of a thousandth, so there are one thousand millimetres to the metre and one thousand metres to the kilometre. The prefixes are never combined, so for example a millionth of a metre is a micrometre, not a millimillimetre. Multiples of the kilogram are named as if the gram were the base unit, so a millionth of a kilogram is a milligram, not a microkilogram.|$|E

5|$|Diocletian's {{administrative}} reforms had {{the twin}} aims of ensuring political stability and providing the bureaucratic infrastructure needed {{to raise the}} recruits and supplies needed by the army. At the top, Diocletian instituted the Tetrarchy. This divided the empire into two halves, East and West, each to be ruled by an Augustus (emperor). Each Augustus would in turn appoint a deputy called a Caesar, who would act both as his ruling partner (each Caesar was assigned {{a quarter of the}} empire) and designated successor. This four-man team would thus have the flexibility to deal with <b>multiple</b> <b>and</b> simultaneous challenges as well as providing for a legitimate succession. The latter failed in its central aim, to prevent the disastrous civil wars caused by the multiple usurpations of the 3rd century. Indeed, the situation may have been made worse, by providing each pretender with a substantial comitatus to enforce his claim. Diocletian himself lived (in retirement) to see his successors fight each other for power. But the division of the empire into Eastern and Western halves, recognising both geographical and cultural realities, proved enduring: it was mostly retained during the 4th century and became permanent after 395.|$|E

Usually, initial designs need to be adjusted repeatedly through computer simulations until the closed-loop system performs or compromises as desired.|$|E

30|$|Similar to single-carrier multi-antenna systems, {{the signal}} {{arriving}} at the receive antenna can potentially be affected by <b>multiple</b> TOs <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> CFOs, when the transmit antennas are fed by different oscillators and are distant from one another.

25|$|Between 60 and 80% of TSC {{patients}} have benign tumors (once thought hamartomatous, but now considered true neoplasms) of the kidneys called angiomyolipomas frequently causing hematuria.
