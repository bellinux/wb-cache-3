500|$|In a 1971 {{letter to}} Paul McCartney, Lennon wrote, [...] "When people ask <b>me</b> <b>questions</b> about 'What did George Martin really do for you?,' I {{have only one}} answer, 'What does he do now?' I noticed you had no answer for that! It's not a putdown, it's the truth." [...] Lennon wrote that Martin took too much credit for the Beatles' music. Commenting {{specifically}} on [...] "Revolution 9", Lennon said with ironic authority, [...] "For Martin to state that he was 'painting a sound picture' is pure hallucination. Ask {{any of the other}} people involved. The final editing Yoko and I did alone." ...|$|E
500|$|Morrison {{returned}} to the A studios between June and August to record the remaining six tracks that featured on the album. For this second session Dahaud Shaar filled the role of engineer, though Shaar did not remember Morrison giving the job to him: [...] "Elliot {{thought he was going}} to be the co-producer, but then again I never saw him calling takes or asking people to change parts ... I didn't consider myself co-producer. Van would ask <b>me</b> <b>questions</b> and I would give him answers, but it was never a defined role." [...] Morrison felt unsatisfied with some of the final recordings, and notably reworked the song [...] "Street Choir" [...] shortly before studio work concluded.|$|E
500|$|The video depicts {{an ongoing}} {{conflict}} between gangs, which Ferreira attempts to remedy upon her arrival; she is eventually taken {{in for questioning}} by law enforcement, although she resists her arrest and later escapes from jail. She commented that its concept was inspired by real events, and elaborated that [...] "people always ask <b>me</b> <b>questions</b> about certain things, and it's kind of like my response." [...] Jeremy Gordon from Pitchfork Media interpreted Ferreira's commentary to be referencing her arrest in September 2013, {{in which she was}} charged with possession of ecstasy. Ferreira was criticized on social media networks for allegedly objectifying African American people in the music video, with whom she was seen dancing with during several scenes interspersed throughout the clip. On her Facebook account, Ferreira commented that [...] "I never have and never will look at any human being as a prop" [...] and criticized false assumptions of the [...] "rich little white girl exploiting the black people and the ghetto".|$|E

2500|$|Michael Musto of The Village Voice {{commented on}} the media's {{reaction}} to the incident, saying, [...] "Janet became a symbolic Joan of Arc to burn at the stake. I actually do think her breast {{was used as a}} diversionary tactic – I'm not sure to distract from Iraq specifically – but it did distract from important issues, from things we actually should be appalled by. The story got an undue amount of attention when the fact is, nobody has proved how her breast harmed anyone." [...] Speaking to Robert Tannenbaum of Blender Magazine, Jackson had strong, if guarded, views on the reactions, saying the furor [...] "is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war, famine, homelessness, AIDS". The fact that it happened in an election year [...] "did have {{a great deal to do}} with it. They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. People are going to think what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast. That's like having your penis hanging out in front of millions and millions of people." [...] Janet declared the reaction to the accidental exposure as [...] "contradictory", noting it to occur in an era where commercials for beer and Viagra are both [...] "very sexual" [...] and [...] "practically omnipresent". Jackson also said the mishap was [...] "not intentional" [...] and a [...] "costume accident", also commenting on some media outlets editing her taped apology, saying, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident...That's what the media does, that's the way they are because they want it to be told a different way." [...] In Glamour Magazine, Janet exclaimed, [...] "It's hard to believe that there's a war and famine going on in the world and yet people made such a big deal about a breast. People said that it was done intentionally to sell records. Do you know what? I have never pulled a stunt. Why would you do that and have your album come out two months later? It doesn't make sense." [...] In the ensuing months, Janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her. [...] "People think I'm immune to being hurt by what's said. They ask <b>me</b> <b>questions</b> that shock me. Not everybody is as strong as the next person and words can kill. People push you and you start to think, 'Can I handle this?' But I know I can." ...|$|E
