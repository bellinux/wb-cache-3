Internal levels of ethylene in excess of those necessary to saturate the leaf movement inhibition response occurred in tops of treated plants before and after symptom expression. These internal levels of ethylene, while averages for the entire plant tops, probably occur at the specific site of action and thus account for the action of picloram in inhibition of leaf movement and related responses. Quantitative differences in the leaf <b>movement</b> <b>response</b> of both species to picloram and ethylene were observed.

40|$|BACKGROUND/HYPOTHESIS The video Head Impulse Test (vHIT) is {{now widely}} {{used to test}} the {{function}} of each of the six semicircular canals individually by measuring the eye rotation response to an abrupt head rotation in the plane of the canal. The main measure of canal adequacy is the ratio of the eye <b>movement</b> <b>response</b> to the head movement stimulus, i. e., the gain of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). However, {{there is a need for}} normative data about how VOR gain is affected by age and also by head velocity, to allow the response of any particular patient to be compared to the responses of healthy subjects in their age range. In this study, we determined for all six semicircular canals, normative values of VOR gain, for each canal across a range of head velocities, for healthy subjects in each decade of life. STUDY DESIGN The VOR gain was measured for all canals across a range of head velocities for at least 10 healthy subjects in decade age bands: 10 - 19, 20 - 29, 30 - 39, 40 - 49, 50 - 59, 60 - 69, 70 - 79, 80 - 89. METHODS The compensatory eye <b>movement</b> <b>response</b> to a small, unpredictable, abrupt head rotation (head impulse) was measured by the ICS impulse prototype system. The same operator delivered every impulse to every subject. RESULTS Vestibulo-ocular reflex gain decreased at high head velocities, but was largely unaffected by age into the 80 - to 89 -year age group. There were some small but systematic differences between the two directions of head rotation, which appear to be largely due to the fact that in this study only the right eye was measured. The results are considered in relation to recent evidence about the effect of age on VOR performance. CONCLUSION These normative values allow the results of any particular patient to be compared to the values of healthy people in their age range and so allow, for example, detection of whether a patient has a bilateral vestibular loss. VOR gain, as measured directly by the eye <b>movement</b> <b>response</b> to head rotation, seems largely unaffected by aging...|$|E

We measured the perceptual direction biases psychophysically and the smooth eye-movement direction biases using two methods (standard averaging and oculometric analysis).

40|$|Horizontal head {{movements}} were studied in six subjects {{as they made}} rapid hoi-izontal gaze adjustments while walking. The aim of the present research was to deteimine if gait-cycle events alter the head <b>movement</b> <b>response</b> to a visual target acquisition task. Gaze shifts of approximately 40 " were elicited by a step change {{in the position of}} a visual target from a central location to a second location in the left or i-ight horizontal pei-ipheiy. The timing of the target position change was constrained to occur at 25, 50, 75 and 100 % of the stride cycle. The trials were randomly presented as the subjects walked on a treadmill at their prefeiyed speed (range: 1. 25 to 1. 48 m / s, mean: 1. 39 1 : 0. 09 d s). Analyses focused on the movement onset latencies of the head and eyes and on the peak velocity and saccade amplitude of the head <b>movement</b> <b>response.</b> A comparison of the group means indicated that the head movement onset lagged the eye onset (262 ms versus 252 ms). The head and eye movement onset latencies were not affected by either the direction of the target change nor the point in the gait cycle during which the target relocation occm-ed. However, the presence of an interaction between the gait cycle events and the direction of the visual target shift indicates that the peak head saccade velocity and head saccade amplitude are affected by the natural head oscillations that occur while walking.

40|$|In {{the overall}} aim {{for a better}} {{understanding}} of the vestibular and optokinetic systems and their roles in space motion sickness, the eye <b>movement</b> <b>responses</b> to various dynamic stimuli are measured.

The specific objective is to develop software programs necessary to characterize the vestibulo-ocular and optokinetic responses by distinguishing between the two phases of nystagmus. The overall program is to handle large volumes of highly variable data with minimum operator interaction. The programs include digital filters, differentiation, identification of fast phases, and reconstruction of the slow phase with a least squares fit such that sinusoidal or psuedorandom data may be processed with accurate results.

40|$|Background: Prediction of <b>movement</b> <b>responses</b> to {{noxious stimuli}} during {{anaesthesia}} is of clinical importance. Susceptibility of a parameter of immobility to both hypnotic and analgesic influences could pose an advantage. Here, nociceptive reflexes might be useful, but data regarding the suppression by hypnotic substances are scarce. Therefore, {{we compared the}} prediction of <b>movement</b> <b>responses</b> by the RIII reflex threshold and the bispectral index (BIS) during propofol mono-anaesthesia. Methods: Fifteen male volunteers were included. Propofol effect compartment concentration was increased every 15 min in steps of 1 µg/ml (max 7 µg/ml). Every 5 min, the reactions to trapezius squeezes and 30 s tetanic stimulations (80 mA) of the right ulnar nerve were tested. The RIII reflex threshold was estimated continuously using an automated threshold tracking system that analyses the nociceptive RIII response at the left biceps femoris muscle to stimulation of the left sural nerve. Results: Twelve subjects completed the study. RIII threshold values were normalized by subtraction of the first threshold that was estimated after the subject’s loss of consciousness. The population prediction probability PK amounted to 0. 84 for the RIII threshold and to 0. 86 for the BIS (difference not significant). Conclusions: <b>Movement</b> <b>responses</b> to noxious stimuli under propofol can be predicted by the RIII threshold with a comparable accuracy as the BIS. Therefore, the RIII threshold seems {{to be influenced by}} hypnotic effects. Since susceptibility of the RIII threshold to analgesic influences is well established, an advantage for the RIII threshold in the prediction of motor responses could be expected when analgesic substances are used in addition to propofol...|$|R
