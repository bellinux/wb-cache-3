5|$|Goebel's {{abrasive}} personality {{made him}} many political enemies, but his championing of populist causes, like railroad regulation, also won him <b>many</b> <b>friends.</b> This conflict of opinions {{came to a}} head in the Kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899. Goebel, a Democrat, divided his party with self-serving political tactics at a time when Kentucky Republicans were finally gaining strength, having elected the party's first governor four years previously. These dynamics led to a close contest between Goebel and William S. Taylor. In the politically chaotic climate that resulted, Goebel was assassinated. Everyone charged in connection with the murder was either acquitted or eventually pardoned, and the identity of his assassin remains uncertain.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, Pullin married Alice Ramsden. The {{couple had}} four sons. He {{did not have}} <b>many</b> <b>friends,</b> {{but he was very}} close to the ones he had. His early {{association}} with churches, through his father, gave him an interest in ecclesiastical music; he often played the harmonium to entertain himself and his family. He had strong views on organ music, and once he had formed an opinion he rarely changed his mind.|$|E

To capture the authentic spirit of the story, Stroheim insisted on filming on location in San Francisco, the Sierra Nevada mountains, the Big Dipper Mine in Iowa Hill, and Death Valley. He rented some of the actual buildings that had inspired scenes in the novel. Other locations included Cliff House and San Francisco Bay.|$|E

By Party protocol, Khrushchev was required to approve these arrests, and did little or nothing to save his friends and colleagues.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo had <b>many</b> <b>friends</b> {{who are now}} renowned {{either in}} their fields or for their {{historical}} significance. They included the mathematician Luca Pacioli, with whom he collaborated on the book De divina proportione in the 1490s. Leonardo appears to have had no close relationships with women except for his friendship with Cecilia Gallerani and the two Este sisters, Beatrice and Isabella. While on a journey that took him through Mantua, he drew a portrait of Isabella {{that appears to have}} been used to create a painted portrait, now lost.|$|E

He was Yuki's classmate in elementary school, and he eventually became her boyfriend after her transition. Unlike Yuki, Shiina had <b>many</b> <b>friends</b> in school. He generally just watches over Shuichi and Yoshino with Yuki, but he sometimes does bold and unexpected things, such as grabbing Yoshino's crotch when he first meets Yoshino because he feared that, because Yoshino was dressed as a boy at the time, Yuki might be having an illicit affair with Yoshino.|$|E
5|$|Theodore Synadenos was {{a son of}} the megas stratopedarches John Synadenos and Theodora Palaiologina, the niece of Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282), {{and hence}} {{a member of the}} Byzantine Empire's highest aristocracy. He had a {{probably}} older brother also named John, and at least one sister, Euphrosyne.

He was president of the Manufacturers Association of Israel, the Rotary Club of Israel, and the Variety Club of Israel, which he helped found.

Angel's funeral was attended by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Likud party leader Benjamin Netanyahu, and other government officials.|$|E

5|$|Harrison had <b>many</b> <b>friends</b> in {{the eastern}} aristocracy, and quickly gained a {{reputation}} among them as a frontier leader. He ran a successful horse-breeding enterprise that won him acclaim throughout the Northwest Territory. Harrison became a champion of lower land prices, a primary concern of settlers in the Territory at the time. The U.S. Congress had legislated a territorial land policy that led to high land costs, which many of the territory's residents disliked. In October 1799, after it had been determined that the Northwest Territory's population had reached a sufficient number to have a delegate in the U.S. Congress, Harrison ran for election. He campaigned to encourage further migration to the territory, which eventually led to statehood.|$|E
5|$|He later {{spoke on}} the {{background}} of the album's sound, saying, I'm 28 years old, and I see that I'm kind of in this weird position. I don't have <b>many</b> <b>friends</b> in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Sargent married Eileen Laura Harding Horne (1898–1977), {{daughter}} of Frederick Horne of Drinkstone, Suffolk. Sargent's biographers differ on her background. Aldous states {{that she was}} a maid in domestic service, whereas Reid notes {{that she was a}} keen rider, with <b>many</b> <b>friends</b> in hunting circles, and that her uncle (who officiated at her wedding to Sargent) was rector of Drinkstone, Suffolk. According to Aldous, it was believed locally that Sargent had to marry Horne, having made her pregnant. By 1926, the couple had two children, a daughter Pamela who died of polio in 1944, and a son Peter. Sargent was much affected by his daughter's death, and his recording of Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius in 1945 was an expression of his grief.|$|E

5|$|In October 1776, {{at the age}} of 17, Wilberforce went up to St John's College, Cambridge. The {{deaths of}} his {{grandfather}} and uncle in 1777 had left him independently wealthy and as a result he had little inclination or need to apply himself to serious study. Instead he immersed himself in the social round of student life and pursued a hedonistic lifestyle enjoying cards, gambling and late-night drinking sessions – although he found the excesses of some of his fellow students distasteful. Witty, generous and an excellent conversationalist, Wilberforce was a popular figure. He made <b>many</b> <b>friends</b> including the more studious future Prime Minister William Pitt. Despite his lifestyle and lack of interest in studying he managed to pass his examinations and was awarded a B.A. in 1781 and an M.A. in 1788.|$|E
5|$|Rory Swann is {{the chief}} {{engineer}} of the Hyperion. Swann came {{from a family of}} tech-savvy miners who opened a successful private mining operation on Meinhoff: however, their operation was crushed by ever-rising taxes. Swann lodged a complaint to the Kel-Morian Combine officials and discovered that Tavish Kerr, who's mining operations weren't burden with taxes, bribed officials to put rival claims out of business through excessive taxation. Swann started a miner's revolt, claiming independence from the Kel-Morian Combine. However, Combine forces arrived and mercilessly crushed the revolt. Swann himself lost an arm, along with <b>many</b> <b>friends,</b> and was only saved because Raynor's Raiders responded to their distress signal. Swann had nothing left, so he joined the Raiders.|$|E
5|$|In 1866, Sullivan {{composed}} a one-act comic opera, Cox and Box, {{which is still}} widely performed. His most successful orchestral work, the Overture di Ballo, premiered in 1870. Sullivan's talent and native charm earned him <b>many</b> <b>friends</b> in musical and social circles, including Queen Victoria's son Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh. In 1871, Sullivan wrote his first opera with W. S. Gilbert, Thespis. Sullivan then produced his Festival Te Deum (1872), an oratorio, The Light of the World (1873), and incidental music for West End productions of several Shakespeare plays. He also had conducting and academic appointments. In 1875, producer Richard D'Oyly Carte reunited Gilbert and Sullivan to create a one-act piece, Trial by Jury, which was a surprise hit. Their 1878 opera H.M.S. Pinafore became an international sensation, as did The Pirates of Penzance (1879) and Patience (1881). Sullivan never married but had a long love affair with an American socialite, Fanny Ronalds. After {{the death of his}} brother Fred in 1877, Sullivan supported Fred's large family financially {{for the rest of his}} life, effectively adopting his nephew Bertie.|$|E
