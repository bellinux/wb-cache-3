25|$|In 2009, {{concerns}} surfaced that {{design changes}} {{had made the}} helicopter too heavy to operate from Dutch frigates {{for which they were}} ordered. In June 2014, the Dutch government decided not to accept the last batch of 7 NH90s due to some 100 shortcomings found in relation to the design, manufacturing and <b>material</b> <b>choice</b> of the aircraft, in particular corrosion in the presence of salt water. In December 2014, NH90 deliveries restarted after the Dutch government came to an agreement with the manufacturer, under which modifications and necessary repairs against corrosion would be made at the manufacturer's cost; 75 of the 100 shortcomings were also reported as having been solved.|$|E
25|$|Compared to filters {{that hang}} {{on the back of}} the aquarium, canister-style {{external}} filters offer a greater quantity of filter materials to be used along with a greater degree of flexibility with respect to filter <b>material</b> <b>choice.</b> Water enters the canister filled with the chosen filter material through an intake pipe at the bottom of the canister, passes through the material, and is fed back to the aquarium through the return pipe. Water is forced to circulate through the filter by a pump typically installed at the top of the canister. It is important to note that canister filters are sealed, fully flooded systems, meaning that the aquarium, intake pipe, filter interior and the return pipe form a continuous body of water. In this configuration both the intake and return path form two siphons, which precisely counterbalance each other. Under these circumstances, the filter pump does not have to spend any effort to lift the water back to the aquarium, regardless of how high the latter is installed above the canister. The pump should only be powerful enough to push the water through the filtering material as well as overcome the drag in the intake and return pipes. This makes canister filter pumps virtually insensitive to the height difference between the aquarium and the filter (although exceeding the manufacturer-specified height limit can lead to leaks).|$|E

500|$|The {{design of}} the Dr Pepper Ballpark was spearheaded by David M. Schwarz. Schwarz had a stated goal of {{creating}} a [...] "park within a (ball)park" [...] in the stadium. To achieve this effect, the nine interconnected pavilions, where concessions, restrooms, and luxury suites are located, are built separately from the main seating area. The space between these pavilions allows for improved air flow in the Texas heat; the wind can move through the buildings and is not impeded by their presence. Constructed of James Hardie fiber cement siding, architectural critics have commented that their layout and <b>material</b> <b>choice</b> enhances the village-like feel of the ballpark, giving it a [...] "coastal Galveston aesthetic". Others have commented that the design is very reminiscent of Churchill Downs in Kentucky.|$|E
2500|$|Barnes {{introduced}} the distinctive zig-zag envelope to reduce fabric waste {{and the use}} of glossy, heat resistant polyester instead of nylon for envelopes. [...] This <b>material</b> <b>choice</b> resulted in a higher maximum envelope temperature of 300 degrees Fahrenheit. [...] Barnes also designed a distinctive triangular basket to offer increased volume, tipping resistance and corner stowage of three fuel tanks. Barnes' most significant contribution was in drastically simplifying venting and deflation by inventing the parachute top. Later Barnes would invent the FlexNet Envelope, which prevented the possibility of envelope tears growing beyond a single panel. The type certificates issued to The Balloon Works are still the basis of the popular line of balloons produced by FireFly Balloons. Often, early balloons manufactured by the company are referred to as [...] "Barnes" [...] balloons, however this was never the actual company name. The company's name from 2000 on has been FireFly Balloons.|$|E

50|$|Bags {{used to keep}} pizza hot {{while being}} transported are {{commonly}} referred to as hotbags or hot bags. Hotbags are thermal bags, typically made of vinyl, nylon, or Cordura, that passively retain heat. <b>Material</b> <b>choice</b> affects cost, durability, and condensation. Heated bags supply added heat through insertion of externally heated disks, electrical heating elements, or pellets heated by induction from electrically generated magnetic waves. Innovations in delivery bag designs have allowed without the usage of a fixed box for bike delivery, such as a hard frame, back straps, and waterproofing. These systems proved to be cheaper, more efficient and faster to use.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} approach {{is shown by}} a photobioreactor, which is built in a tapered geometry and which carries a helically attached, translucent double hose circuit system. The result is a layout similar to a Christmas tree. The tubular system is constructed in modules and can theoretically be scaled outdoors up to agricultural scale. A dedicated location is not crucial, similar to other closed systems, and therefore non-arable land is suitable as well. The <b>material</b> <b>choice</b> should prevent biofouling and ensure high final biomass concentrations. The combination of turbulence and the closed concept should allow a clean operation and a high operational availability.|$|E
40|$|Decisions on {{material}} selections for electronics packaging {{can be quite}} complicated {{by the need to}} balance the criteria to withstand severe impacts yet survive deep thermal cycles intact.

The goal of this program focuses on developing both increased intuition for generic packaging guidelines and computational methodologies for optimizing packaging in specific components. Initial efforts centered on characterization of classes of materials common to packaging strategies and computational analyses of stresses generated during thermal cycling to identify strengths and weaknesses of various <b>material</b> <b>choices.</b> Future studies will analyze the same example problems incorporating the effects of curing stresses as needed and analyzing dynamic loadings to compare trends with the quasi-static conclusions...|$|R

50|$|There {{are certain}} {{technical}} requirements that engineers {{have to meet}} {{in order to develop}} safe bionic lenses. First, power must be provided to bionic lenses via wireless mediums. Second, bionic lenses have to be bio-compatible. These requirements challenge engineers by limiting their <b>material</b> <b>choice</b> and imposing a regulatory standard regarding radio-frequency radiation, so as not to harm the user. Third, micro-scale components should be mechanically and electrically integrated on a polymer substrate. And finally, all of these operations have to be completed within the volume of standard contact lenses, that being 1 cm² in area with a thickness of 200 μm or smaller.|$|E

50|$|The mould {{material}} {{must have}} sufficient strength, hardness and accuracy at high temperature and pressure. Good oxidation resistance, {{low thermal expansion}} and high thermal conductivity are also required.The material of the mould has to be suitable to withstand the process temperatures without undergoing deforming processes. Therefore, the mould <b>material</b> <b>choice</b> depends critically on the transition temperature of the glass material. For low-Tg-glasses, steel moulds with a nickel alloy coating can be used. Since they cannot withstand the high temperatures required for regular optical glasses, heat-resistant materials such as carbide alloys have to be used instead in this case. In addition, mould materials include aluminium alloys, glasslike or vitreous carbon, silicon carbide, silicon nitride and a mixture of silicon carbide and carbon.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{consider}} the <b>materials</b> <b>choices</b> available for making optical substrates for synchrotron radiation beam lines.

Substrates must therefore be made {{of one of these}} materials or of a metal that can be coated with electroless nickel. In the context of <b>material</b> <b>choices</b> for mirrors they explore the issues of dimensional stability, polishing, bending, cooling, and manufacturing strategy. They conclude that metals are best from an engineering and cost standpoint while the ceramics are best from a polishing standpoint. They then give discussions of specific materials as follows: silicon carbide, silicon, electroless nickel, Glidcop{trademark}, aluminum, precipitation-hardening stainless steel, mild steel, invar and superinvar. Finally they summarize conclusions and propose ideas for further research...|$|R
