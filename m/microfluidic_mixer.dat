The mixer is a cast of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) sealed with transparent fused-silica coverglass, which results in low fluorescence background and broad biological compatibility and this enables single-molecule fluorescence detection under nonequilibrium conditions. The pressure regulated sample delivery system is convenient for loading a sample and allows for precise and stable flow velocity control.

40|$|A novel <b>microfluidic</b> <b>mixer</b> {{utilizing}} electrokinetic {{driving forces}} under low switching frequency This paper presents a novel technique in which low-frequency periodic electrokinetic driving forces are utilized to mix electrolytic fluid samples rapidly and efficiently in a double-T-form <b>microfluidic</b> <b>mixer.</b> Without using any additional equipment to induce flow perturbations, {{only a single}} high-voltage power source is required for simulta-neously driving and mixing the sample fluids which results in a simple and low-cost system for the mixing purpose. The effectiveness of the mixer {{as a function of}} the applied electric field and the periodic switching frequency is characterized by the intensity distribution calculated downstream from the mixing zone. The present numerical and experimental results confirm that the proposed double-T-form micro-mixer has excellent mixing capabilities. The mixing efficiency can be as high as 95 % within a mixing length of 1000 mm downstream from the secondary T-junction when a 100 V/cm driving electric field strength and a 2 Hz periodic switching frequency are applied. The results reveal that the optimal switching frequency depends upon the magnitude of the main applied electrical field.

40|$|The {{next step}} in {{miniaturization}} of analytical devices {{involves the use of}} MEMS and Lab-on-a-Chip applications, where many biological or chemical reactions are carried out on the device in real time. Since detection mechanisms occur almost immediately after the reactions, inefficient mixing of reagents could cause a decrease in sensing capability, especially on micro- and nano-scaled devices. Thus a <b>microfluidic</b> <b>mixer</b> has become a crucial component in these applications. Here we propose a new design of a passive <b>microfluidic</b> <b>mixer</b> that utilizes the theories of chaotic advection to enhance mixing. The micro-channels for the mixer have dimensions with width ranging from 10 ?m to 40 ?m, depth 40 ?m, and a total length of 280 ?m. First the designs are simulated using CFD-ACE+ for computational analysis. After the device geometry has been decided, the actual devices are fabricated using traditional UV photolithography on silicon and bonded with pyrex glass by anodic bonding. To test the actual device mixing efficiency, we used a fluorescent dye rhodamine B solution to mix with DI water and put the devices under fluorescent microscope observations for real-time analysis. Images of fluorescent light intensities are taken at different flow rates during the analysis and are later used to study the experimental results calculated using a published mixing efficiency formula for comparison...|$|E

40|$|Mixing two liquids on a {{microfluidic}} chip is notoriously hard because the small dimensions and velocities on the chip effectively prevent turbulence. We present a topological mixing scheme that exploits the laminarity {{of the flow}} to repeatedly fold the flow and exponentially increase the concentration gradients to obtain fast and efficient mixing by diffusion. It is based on helical flow channels with opposite chiralities that split, rotate, and recombine the fluid stream in a topology reminiscent {{of a series of}} Möbius bands.

40|$|The flow {{profiles}} of pressure-driven and electro-kinetic driven flows were compared for a microfluidic chip. It {{was found that}} the pressure-driven flow had a parabolic profile while the electro-kinetic flow had a plug shaped flow profile. The measured velocities were similar to those determined by the Poiseuille flow model and the Helmholtz-Smoltchowski equation. Flow uniformity is very important for control in <b>microfluidic</b> <b>mixers.</b> Parabolic flow profiles lead to inconsistent reactions while the more uniform plug shape flow allow for a more steady reaction across the channel. Previous work had been performed to measure the flow of a solution of fluorescent polystyrene beads in PDMS channels using a laser confocal microscope. This showed that particles easily stuck to the channel making it difficult to measure over time. In addition, bubble formation in the channel made measuring velocities difficult. Current work used a LabSmith Video Synchronized microscope with software to measure the flow rates at different areas of the channel. Solutions of fluorescent polystyrene beads were used to visually observe the flow within a channel under a microscope. Four different channels were used for the pressure-driven flows of varying dimensions and materials. The channel with the best measured profile was also measured under electro-kinetic flow. A LabSmith High Voltage Sequencer was used to apply a voltage across the channel for electro-kinetic measurements. This research confirmed the different flow profiles under pressure-driven and electro-kinetic driven flow. Future work can be done to determine how this effects mixing in the channels...|$|R

We observe the UV fluorescence spectrum from naturally occurring tryptophans in three well-studied proteins, cytochrome c, apomyoglobin, and lysozyme, as a function of time in a <b>microfluidic</b> <b>mixer</b> with a dead time of ∼ 20 μs. Single value decomposition of the time-dependent spectra reveal two separate processes: 1), a spectral shift which occurs within the mixing time; and 2), a fluorescence decay occurring between ∼ 100 and 300 μs. We attribute the first process to hydrophobic collapse and the second process to the formation of the first native tertiary contacts...|$|E
40|$|The {{assembly}} of intermediate filaments (IFs) {{is a complex}} process that can be recapitulated {{through a series of}} distinct steps in vitro. The combination of microfluidics and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) provides a powerful tool to investigate the kinetics of this process on the relevant timescales. <b>Microfluidic</b> <b>mixers</b> based on the principle of hydrodynamic focusing allow for precise control of the mixing of proteins and smaller reagents like ions. Here, we present a multi-layer device that prevents proteins from adsorbing to the channel walls by engulfing the protein jet with a fluid layer of buffer. To ensure compatibility with SAXS, the device is fabricated from UV-curable adhesive (NOA 81). To demonstrate the successful prevention of contact between the protein jet and the channel walls we measure the distribution of a fluorescent dye in the device by confocal microscopy at various flow speeds and compare the results to finite element method (FEM) simulations. The prevention of contact enables the investigation of the {{assembly of}} IFs in flow by gradually increasing the salt concentration in the protein jet. The diffusion of salt into the jet can be determined by FEM simulations. SAXS data are collected at different positions in the jet, corresponding to different salt concentrations, and they reveal distinct differences between the earliest assembly states. We find that the mean square radius of gyration perpendicular to the filament axis increases from 13 nm(2) to 58 nm(2) upon assembly.

40|$|The {{technique}} of Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) has been employed to quantitatively and spatially map the fluid composition and temperature within microfluidic systems. A molecular probe with a solvent-sensitive fluorescence lifetime {{has been exploited}} to investigate and map the diffusional mixing of fluid streams under laminar flow conditions within a microfluidic device. Using FLIM, the fluid composition is mapped with high quantification and spatial resolution to assess the extent of mixing. This technique was extended to quantitatively evaluate the mixing efficiency {{of a range of}} commercial <b>microfluidic</b> <b>mixers</b> employing various mixing strategies, including the use of obstacles fabricated within the channels. A fluorescently labelled polymer has been investigated as a new probe for mapping temperature within microfluidic devices using FLIM. Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) measurements showed that the average fluorescence lifetime displayed by an aqueous solution of the polymer depended strongly on temperature, increasing from 3 ns to 13. 5 ns between 23 and 38 oC. This effect was exploited using FLIM to provide high spatial resolution temperature mapping with sub-degree temperature resolution within microfluidic devices. A temperature-sensitive, water-soluble derivative of the rhodamine B fluorophore, effective over a wide dynamic temperature range (25 to 91 oC) has been used to map the temperature distribution during the mixing of fluid streams of different temperatures within a microchannel. In addition, this probe was employed to quantify the fluid temperature in a prototype microfluidic system for DNA amplification. FLIM has been demonstrated to provide a superior approach to the imaging within microfluidic systems over other commonly used techniques, such as fluorescence intensity and colourimetric imaging.
