In particular, the photodissociation of N 2 and CN are significantly shielded by the H 2 photodissociation line spectrum. We model this by switching off the photodissociation channels for these species behind the HI to H 2 transition. We also model the shielding effect of the carbon photoionization continuum as an attenuation of the incident radiation field shortwards of 1102 Å. Using recent line and continuum cross section data, we present calculations of the direct and cosmic ray induced photorates for a range of species, as well as optically thick shielding factors for the carbon continuum.

The <b>photodissociation</b> dynamics {{are similar to those}} observed for HOCl. The OH and OD distributions are rotationally cold and, for almost all of the states investigated, Gaussian in shape. Preferential population of the OH (or OD) 2 PI 3 / 2 spin- orbit state was observed, together with a strong preference for the PI(A') LAMBDA-doublet levels. The alignment, beta 0 (2) (02), tends towards the limiting value of - 0. 5 at the highest N levels that could be observed. In contrast to the photolysis of HOCl, about 10 % of the OH fragment was observed in the first excited vibrational state, with a similar rotational distribution to the OH(v = 0) products.

40|$|The quantum {{mechanical}} time-dependent wavepacket {{method is}} {{introduced in the}} context of the field of chemical dynamics. The theory of the method is presented for two processes of interest in dynamics: <b>molecular</b> <b>photodissociation,</b> and reactive scattering. For the first of these processes, an expression is derived for the absorption spectrum of a molecule undergoing an electronic bound-continuum transition. For the second process, a time-dependent formulation is obtained for the S-matrix, and the "flux formulation" for the calculation of initial state-selected reaction probabilities (ISSRPs) is shown to be equivalent to summing over appropriate S-matrix elements. The time-dependent wavepacket theory for <b>molecular</b> <b>photodissociation</b> is used in the calculation of the photodetachment spectrum of the FHÌâ anion. Spectra are calculated for two different energy resolutions, and previously unobserved structure is seen in the higher resolution spectrum. The structure is assigned by studying energy-dependent wavefunctions corresponding to each peak in the spectrum. Some peaks are assigned to direct scattering states, while others are assigned to quantum mechanical resonance states localised in the reactant and product valleys of the potential energy surface. The implication of this is that a high-resolution photodetachment experiment may provide the first experimental evidence for resonances in the F + H 2 reaction. For reactive scattering, the time-dependent wavepacket method is used (in conjunction with the rotationally adiabatic approximation for J > 0 calculations) to calculate ISSRPs for various initial states of the nearly-thermoneutral ionmolecule reaction: N + (3 P) +H 2 (1 Î£ + g) âNH + (X 2 II) +H(2 S). Dense resonance structure in the reaction probabilities for J = 0 is attributed to the influence of the deep wells in. the potential energy surface for the reaction. The ISSRPs are used to calculate initial state-selected cross sections and rate constants which are compared with the results of some earlier trajectory calculations and with experimental data. The implications of the results for the astrophysical significance of the reaction are discussed. </p...|$|E

For one-photon absorption from the v = 3 - 8 levels, molecular photoionization competes with photodissociation into a ground-state atom and an atom in an n = 2 excited state. A detailed comparison of the photoelectron spectra obtained via different rotational branches and vibrational levels strongly indicates that singly excited bound 1 and 1 g Rydberg states at the four-photon level exert a significant influence on the final state distributions of H. In contrast, one-photon absorption from the v = 9 and higher levels leads almost exclusively to dissociation into a ground-state atom and an excited-state atom with n > 2. Excited atomic fragments are ionized in a one-photon absorption step, and excited-atom distributions over the energetically allowed values of the principal quantum number n are obtained. Simulations of these distributions suggest that excitation of dissociative continua of bound 1 (1 sg) (nsg), 1 (1 sg) (ndg), and 1 g(1 sg) (ndg) Rydberg states may dominate over excitation of dissociative doubly excited 1 (2 pu) (npu) and 1 g(2 pu) (npu) states when considering the dissociation dynamics after one-photon absorption from the v 9 levels of the B-state...|$|R
40|$|We present {{high-resolution}} hydrodynamical {{simulations of}} isolated dwarf galaxies including self-gravity, non-equilibrium cooling and chemistry, interstellar radiation fields (IRSF) and shielding, star formation, and stellar feedback. This includes spatially and temporally varying photoelectric (PE) heating, photoionization, resolved supernova (SN) blast waves and metal enrichment. A new flexible method {{to sample the}} stellar initial mass function allows us to follow the contribution to the ISRF, the metal output and the SN delay times of individual massive stars. We find that SNe play the dominant role in regulating the global star formation rate, shaping the multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) and driving galactic outflows. Outflow rates (with mass-loading factors of a few) and hot gas fractions of the ISM increase {{with the number of}} SNe exploding in low-density environments where radiative energy losses are low. While PE heating alone can suppress star formation slightly more (a factor of a few) than SNe alone can do, it is unable to drive outflows and reproduce the multi-phase ISM that emerges naturally when SNe are included. These results are in conflict with recent results of Forbes et al. who concluded that PE heating is the dominant process suppressing star formation in dwarfs, about an order of magnitude more efficient than SNe. Potential origins for this discrepancy are discussed. In the absence of SNe and photoionization (mechanisms to disperse dense clouds), the impact of PE heating is highly overestimated owing to the (unrealistic) proximity of dense gas to the radiation sources. This leads to a substantial boost of the infrared continuum emission from the UV-irradiated dust and a far infrared line-to-continuum ratio too low compared to observations.
