40|$|We posit that accreting compact objects, {{including}} stellar mass {{black holes}} and neutron stars {{as well as}} supermassive black holes, may undergo extended periods of accretion during which the angular momentum of the disk at large scales is misaligned {{with that of the}} compact object. In such a scenario, Lense-Thirring precession caused by the rotating compact object can dramatically affect the disk. In this presentation we describe results from a three-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of an MRI turbulent disk accreting onto a tilted rapidly rotating black hole. For this case, the disk does not achieve the commonly described Bardeen-Petterson configuration; rather, it remains nearly planar, undergoing a slow global precession. Accretion from the disk onto the hole occurs predominantly through two opposing plunging streams that start from high latitudes with respect to both the black-hole and disk <b>midplanes.</b> This is a consequence of the non-sphericity of the gravitational spacetime of the black hole. 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{the design}} of {{interaction}} region (IR) quadrupoles for high luminosity colliders such as the LHC or a possible upgrade of the Tevatron, the radiation heating of the coil windings is an important issue.

The second solution eliminates the conductor from the areas with the highest radiation intensity, which are located on the symmetry-axes of the <b>midplanes</b> of the coils. A novel quadrupole design is presented, in which the conductor is wound on four half-moon shaped supports, forming elongated toroid sections. The assembly of the four shapes yields a quadrupole field with an active flux return path, and a void in the high radiation area. This void can be occupied by a liquid helium cooling pipe to lower the temperature of the windings from the inside.

40|$|Discharge {{periods of}} {{lead-acid}} batteries are significantly reduced at subzero centigrade temperatures. The reduction {{is more than}} what can be expected due to decreased rates of various processes caused by a lowering of temperature and occurs {{despite the fact that}} active materials are available for discharge. It is proposed that the major cause for this is the freezing of the electrolyte. The concentration of acid decreases during battery discharge with a consequent increase in the freezing temperature. A battery freezes when the discharge temperature falls below the freezing temperature. A mathematical model is developed for conditions where charge-transfer reaction is the rate-limiting step, and Tafel kinetics are applicable. It is argued that freezing begins from the <b>midplanes</b> of electrodes and proceeds toward the reservoir in-between. Ionic conduction stops when one of the electrodes freezes fully and the time taken to reach that point, namely the discharge period, is calculated. The predictions of the model compare well to observations made at low current density C/ 5 and at − 20 and − 40 °C. At higher current densities, however, diffusional resistances become important and a more complicated moving boundary problem needs to be solved to predict the discharge periods...|$|R

The protostele shows a central protoxylem strand and numerous strands distributed along the <b>midplanes</b> of the ribs. The vascular supply to lateral organ is composed of two pairs of traces, produced {{at the same time}} by the two ribs issued from a single primary rib of the protostele.
