5|$|Remember <b>Me</b> <b>was</b> {{developed}} as the debut project of Dontnod Entertainment, {{with one of}} the company's founding members Jean-Maxime Moris as its director.

Originally a PlayStation 3-exclusive under Sony titled Adrift, it was cancelled in 2011 and later purchased by Capcom which resurrected it as a multiplatform game. General praise was given for the world design, Olivier Deriviere's soundtrack, the ambition of the story and the Memory Remix segments, while the main criticisms laid against other aspects of the story, poor design choices and formulaic combat.|$|E

Though we had passed over not less than four-and-twenty miles of very rugged ground, and had a Highland dance {{on the top of}} Dùn Can, the highest mountain in the island, we returned in the evening not at all fatigued, and piqued ourselves at not being outdone at the nightly ball by our less active friends, who had remained at home.|$|E
