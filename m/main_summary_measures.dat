40|$|BACKGROUND: Summary {{measures}} of health are essential in making estimates of health status that are comparable {{across time and}} place. They {{can be used for}} assessing the performance of health systems, informing effective policy making, and monitoring the progress of nations toward achievement of sustainable development goals. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015) provides disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and healthy life expectancy (HALE) as <b>main</b> <b>summary</b> <b>measures</b> of health. We assessed the trends of health status in Iran and 15 neighboring countries using these summary measures. METHODS: We used the results of GBD 2015 to present the levels and trends of DALYs, life expectancy (LE), and HALE in Iran and its 15 neighboring countries from 1990 to 2015. For each country, we assessed the ratio of observed levels of DALYs and HALE to those expected based on socio-demographic index (SDI), an indicator composed of {{measures of}} total fertility rate, income per capita, and average years of schooling. RESULTS: All-age numbers of DALYs reached over 19 million years in Iran in 2015. The all-age number of DALYs has remained stable {{during the past two decades}} in Iran, despite the decreasing trends in all-age and age-standardized rates. The all-cause DALY rates decreased from 47, 200 in 1990 to 28, 400 per 100, 000 in 2015. The share of non-communicable diseases in DALYs increased in Iran (from 42 % to 74 %) and all of its neighbors between 1990 and 2015; the pattern of change is similar in almost all 16 countries. The DALY rates for NCDs and injuries in Iran were higher than global rates and the average rate in High Middle SDI countries, while those for communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders were much lower in Iran. Among men, cardiovascular diseases ranked first in all countries of the region except for Bahrain. Among women, they ranked first in 13 countries. Life expectancy and HALE show a consistent increase in all countries. Still, there are dissimilarities indicating a generally low LE and HALE in Afghanistan and Pakistan and high expectancy in Qatar, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia. Iran ranked 11 th in terms of LE at birth and 12 th in terms of HALE at birth in 1990 which improved to 9 th for both metrics in 2015. Turkey and Iran had the highest increase in LE and HALE from 1990 to 2015 while the lowest increase was observed in Armenia, Pakistan, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Iraq. CONCLUSIONS: The levels and trends in causes of DALYs, life expectancy, and HALE generally show similarities between the 16 countries, although differences exist. The differences observed between countries can be attributed to a myriad of determinants, including social, cultural, ethnic, religious, political, economic, and environmental factors as well as the performance of the health system. Investigating the differences between countries can inform more effective health policy and resource allocation. Concerted efforts at national and regional levels are required to tackle the emerging burden of non-communicable diseases and injuries in Iran and its neighbors...|$|E

Methods: Studies were selected using a study inclusion tool and then data was extracted using the data extraction tool. The primary outcomes assessed were BMI and HbA 1 c. The standardized mean difference (SMD) was the <b>main</b> <b>summary</b> <b>measure</b> and the I 2 statistic ¬¬¬¬¬¬was used to assess variability among the studies. Main Results: Ten studies met inclusion criteria (Total N = 1, 787). The age range of patients was 40 - 66 years old with equal amounts {{of male and female}} participants. Aerobic and resistance exercise were effective (p < 0. 01) in reducing A 1 c; Tai Chi was not (p = 0. 50). Aerobic exercise did not {{have a significant effect on}} BMI (p = 0. 07), however Tai Chi and Resistance exercise did (p< 0. 04). Conclusion: Aerobic and resistance exercise produced a significant reduction in HbA 1 c, whereas Tai Chi did not. The non-significant impact aerobic exercise had on BMI was probably due to large variation between the studies. No significant differences were found between the different forms of exercise and their overall impact on diabetes control. Based upon the data incorporated in this meta-analysis, it is reasonable for patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 to use aerobic or resistance exercise to improve their HbA 1 C. However, it remains to be seen whether recommending specific exercise types over others will provide increased benefit...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundA {{humanitarian}} emergency involves a complete breakdown of authority that often disrupts routine health care delivery, including immunization. Diarrheal diseases are a principal cause of {{morbidity and mortality}} among children during humanitarian emergencies. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess if vaccination against rotavirus, the most common cause of severe diarrhea among children, either as an addition to routine immunization program (RI) or supplemental immunization activity (SIA) would be cost-effective during a {{humanitarian emergency}} to decrease diarrhea morbidity and mortality, using Somalia as a case study. MethodsAn impact and cost-effectiveness analysis was performed comparing no vaccine; two-dose rotavirus SIA and two-dose of RI for the 424, 592 births in the 2012 Somali cohort. The <b>main</b> <b>summary</b> <b>measure</b> was the incremental cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted. Univariate sensitivity analysis examined the extent to which the uncertainty in the variables affected estimates. ResultsIf introduced in Somalia, a full-series rotavirus RI and SIA would save 908 and 359 lives, respectively, and save US$ 63, 793 and US$ 25, 246 in direct medical costs, respectively. The cost of a RI strategy would be US$ 309, 458. Because of the high operational costs, a SIA strategy would cost US$ 715, 713. US$ 5. 30 per DALY would be averted for RI and US$ 37. 62 per DALY averted for SIA. Variables that most substantially influenced the cost-effectiveness for both RI and SIA were vaccine program costs, mortality rate, and vaccine effectiveness against death. ConclusionsBased on our model, rotavirus vaccination appears to be a cost-effective intervention as either RI or SIA, as defined by the World Health Organization as one to three times the per capita Gross Domestic Product (Somalia $ 112 in 2011). RI would have greater health impact and is more cost effective than SIA, assuming feasibility of reaching the target population. However, given the lack of infrastructure, whether RI is realistic in this setting remains unanswered, and alternative approaches like SIA should be further examined...|$|R

Summary scores then were estimated with 12 items in three ways: using standard (U. S. -derived) SF- 12 items and scoring algorithms; standard items and country-specific scoring; and country-specific sets of 12 items and scoring. Replication of the 36 -item <b>summary</b> <b>measures</b> by the 12 -item <b>summary</b> <b>measures</b> was then evaluated through comparison of mean scores and the strength of product-moment correlations. Product-moment correlations between SF- 36 <b>summary</b> <b>measures</b> and SF- 12 <b>summary</b> <b>measures</b> (standard and country-specific) were very high, ranging from 0. 94 - 0. 96 and 0. 94 - 0. 97 for the physical and mental <b>summary</b> <b>measures,</b> respectively.

Because of the high degree of correspondence between summary physical and mental health measures estimated using the SF- 12 and SF- 36, it appears that the SF- 12 will prove to be a practical alternative to the SF- 36 in these countries, for purposes of large group comparisons in which the focus is on overall physical and mental health outcomes...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we review the {{available}} <b>summary</b> <b>measures</b> for {{the magnitude of}} socio-economic inequalities in health. Measures which have been used differ {{in a number of}} important respects, including (1) the measurement of "relative" or "absolute" differences; (2) the measurement of an "effect" of lower socio-economic status, or of the "total impact" of socio-economic inequalities in health upon the health status of the population; (3) simple versus sophisticated measurement techniques. Based on this analysis of <b>summary</b> <b>measures</b> which have previously been applied, eight different classes of <b>summary</b> <b>measures</b> can be distinguished.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{interest}} {{has been rising}} in the development, calculation and use of <b>summary</b> <b>measures</b> of population health, which combine information on mortality and non-fatal health outcomes. This paper reviews the issues and challenges {{in the design and}} application of <b>summary</b> <b>measures</b> and presents a framework for evaluating different alternatives. <b>Summary</b> <b>measures</b> have a variety of uses, including comparisons of health in different populations and assessments of the relative contributions of different diseases, injuries and risk factors to the total disease burden in a population. <b>Summary</b> <b>measures</b> may be divided into two broad families: health expectancies and health gaps.

This paper considers a set of basic criteria and desirable properties that may lead to rejection of certain <b>summary</b> <b>measures</b> and the development of new ones.

HealthPartners will use the <b>summary</b> <b>measures</b> to identify and address conditions and factors that have the greatest impact on {{the health and well-being of}} its patients, members, and community. The method could easily be implemented by other institutions and organizations in the United States, helping to address a persistent need in population health measurement for improvement. 27390075 PMC 495107...|$|R

40|$|We thank Denis de Crombrugghe for useful {{comments}} and discussions. We propose {{a method for}} spatial principal components analysis that has two important advantages over the method that Wartenberg (1985) proposed. The first advantage is that, contrary to Wartenberg’s method, our method has a clear and exact interpretation: it produces a <b>summary</b> <b>measure</b> (component) that itself has maximum spatial correlation. Second, an easy and intuitive link {{can be made to}} canonical correlation analysis. Our spatial canonical correlation analysis produces <b>summary</b> <b>measures</b> of two datasets (e. g., each measuring a different phenomenon), and these <b>summary</b> <b>measures</b> maximize the spatial correlation between themselves. This provides an alternative weighting scheme as compared to spatial principal components analysis. We provide example applications of the methods and show that our variant of spatial canonical correlation analysis may produce rather different results than spatial principal components analysis using Wartenberg’s method. We also illustrate how spatial canonical correlation analysis may produce different results than spatial principal components analysis...|$|R

A validation comparison was made to equivalent pharmacokinetic <b>summary</b> <b>measures</b> calculated from model generated curves fitted to respective plasma insulin concentration data. The validation result was a measure of goodness of fit. Validation for each reported study was classified into one of four cases. Results: Of 37 model fits, 22 were validated on both the Cmax and the tmax <b>summary</b> <b>measures.</b> Another 6 model fits were partially validated on one measure only due to lack of reporting on the second measure with errors to reported or estimated ranges of < 12 %. Another 7 studies could not be validated on either measure because of inadequate reported clinical data. Finally, 2 separate model fits to data from the same study failed the validation with 90 and 71 % error on tmax only, which was likely caused by protocol-based error. No model fit failed the validation on both measures...|$|R
40|$|Understanding of how {{to analyse}} and {{interpret}} quality of life (QoL) data from clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer is limited. In order to increase the knowledge about the possibilities of drawing conclusions from QoL data of these patients, data from 2 trials were reanalysed. A total of 113 patients with pancreatic, biliary or gastric cancer were included in 2 randomised trials comparing chemotherapy and best supportive care (BSC) with BSC alone. Patient benefit was evaluated by the treating physician (subjective response) and by using selected scales and different <b>summary</b> <b>measures</b> of the EORTC QLQ-C 30 questionnaire. An increasing number of drop-outs (mainly due to death) with time did not occur in a random fashion. Therefore, the mean scores in the different subscales of the QLQ-C 30 obtained during the follow-up of interviewed patients did not reflect {{the outcome of the}} randomised population. The scores of the patient-provided <b>summary</b> <b>measure,</b> ‘Global health status/QoL’, were stable in a rather high proportion of the patients and could not discriminate between the 2 groups. 3 other <b>summary</b> <b>measures</b> revealed greater variability, and they all discriminated between the 2 groups. A high agreement was also seen between the changes in the <b>summary</b> <b>measures</b> and the subjective response. A categorisation of whether an individual patient had benefited or not from the intervention could overcome the problem with the selective attrition. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|R
