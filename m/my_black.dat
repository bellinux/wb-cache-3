She lived there {{for the rest of her}} childhood, despite promises that it was only temporary, that she would only be there for six weeks. At the home, she endured mental and physical abuse from both adults and children. This included being shouted at to stop crying for her mother, being force-fed her own vomit, and undergoing an exorcism, during which she was blindfolded and forced to repeat such phrases as [...] "Satan, I cast you out" [...] and [...] "Lord Jesus, purify <b>my</b> <b>black</b> soul."

[...] Simms then motioned for Taylor to run a longer pattern, and after 30–40yards, threw him the pass.
