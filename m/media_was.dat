50|$|Why {{do people}} choose {{one form of}} media over another? According to the Galileo Model, there are {{different}} forms of media spread throughout three-dimensional space.

The farther away from each form of <b>media</b> <b>is</b> in space, the least similar the source of <b>media</b> <b>is.</b> For example, mobile and cell phone are located closest in space where as newspaper and texting are farthest apart in space. The study further explained the relationship between self-concept {{and the use of}} different forms of media. The more hours per day an individual uses a form of media, the closer that form of <b>media</b> <b>is</b> to their self-concept.|$|R

40|$|In {{the age of}} information, {{with the}} {{development}} of new technologies, the <b>media</b> <b>are</b> playing more significant roles in political and economic activities in societies.

5|$|After {{the end of}} {{the promotional}} period, Burger King {{received}} numerous complaints from fans of Chicken Fries through social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook. One of the major ways the company responded was through personalized responses to these posts. Instead of using an automated response that would paste a standardized message on people's Twitter feeds, the company instead employed several staff to personally respond to customers voicing displeasure on the LTO nature of the 2014 introduction. The entire 2014 Chicken Fries promotion represented a major shift in the attitude towards advertising for Burger King, moving from a more traditional advertising structure to one focused almost entirely on digitally-based media. This change happened fairly quickly, falling into place over the twelve to eighteen-month period preceding the reintroduction of Chicken Fries to the chain's menu.
