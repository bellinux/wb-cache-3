[...] The same principles were applied by the Chinese to various plants and fruit-trees. (20/48. 'Memoire sur les Chinois' 1786 tome 11 page 55; tome 5 page 507.) An imperial edict recommends the choice of seed of remarkable size; and selection was practised even by imperial hands, for it is said that the Ya-mi, or imperial rice, was noticed at an ancient period in a field by the Emperor Khang-hi, was saved and cultivated in his garden, and has since become valuable from being the only kind which will grow north of the Great Wall.

50|$|Paeonia is {{the only}} genus {{recognized}} in the Paeoniaceae family. Three sections are distinguished: an early branching Onaepia that consists of both native North-American species P. brownii and P. californica, section Paeonia, which comprises all Eurasian herbaceous species, and the section <b>Moutan,</b> which includes all woody species from China, including Tibet. These relations are represented by the following tree.|$|E
50|$|Many {{synonyms}} {{exist for}} Paeonia officinalis, i.e. <b>Moutan</b> officinalis, Paeonia anemoniflora, P. barrii, P. baxteri, P. commutata, P. elegans, P. feminea, P. festiva, P. fimbrata, P. foemina, P. fulgens, P. fulgida, P. hirsuta, P. lanceolata, P. lobata, P. mollis, P. nemoralis, P. paradoxa var. fimbrata, P. peregrina var. officinalis, f. officinalis, P. porrigens, P. promiscua, P. pubens, P. rubens, P. sessiliflora, P. splendens, P. subternata, P. versicolor.|$|E
5000|$|The {{family name}} [...] "Paeoniaceae" [...] {{was first used}} by Friedrich K.L. Rudolphi in 1830, {{following}} a suggestion by Friedrich Gottlieb Bartling that same year. The family had been given other names a few years earlier. The composition of the family has varied, but it has always consisted of Paeonia and one or more genera that are now placed in Ranunculales. It has been widely believed that Paeonia is closest to Glaucidium, and this idea has been followed in some recent works. Molecular phylogenetic studies, however, have demonstrated conclusively that Glaucidium belongs in the Ranunculaceae family, Ranunculales order, but that Paeonia belongs in the unrelated order Saxifragales. The genus Paeonia consists of about 35 species, assigned to three sections: <b>Moutan,</b> Onaepia and Paeoniae. The section Onaepia only includes P. brownii and P. californicum. The section <b>Moutan</b> is divided into P. delavayi and P. ludlowii, together making up the subsection Delavayanae, and P. catayana, P. decomposita, P. jishanensis, P. osti, P. qiui and P. rockii which constitute the subsection Vaginatae. P. suffruticosa is a cultivated hybrid swarm, not a naturally occurring species.|$|E
50|$|The genus Paeonia {{naturally}} {{occurs in}} the temperate and cold areas of the Northern Hemisphere. The section <b>Moutan,</b> which includes all woody species, is restricted in the wild to Central and Southern China, including Tibet. The section Onaepia consist of two herbaceous species and {{is present in the}} West of North-America, P. brownii between southern British Columbia and the Sierra Nevada in California and eastward to Wyoming and Utah, while P. californica is limited to the coastal mountains of Southern and Central California.|$|E

Mu Dan Pi’s main functions include reducing heat, cooling the blood, improving liver function, and mildly invigorating the blood. Mu Dan Pi of the best quality should be very fragrant, thick, white and starchy. The flower is now mostly cultivated for medicinal uses. Due to over-harvesting, the wild plant is threatened with extinction.|$|E
50|$|Tree peony is {{the vernacular}} {{name for the}} section <b>Moutan</b> of the plant genus Paeonia, {{or one of the}} species or cultivars {{belonging}} to this section. It consists of shrubs that have perennial aereal woody stems. Other peonies do not have perennial woody stems, but their stems die back after the growing season, to emerge again from buds just below the surface early in the following year. Tree peonies have been in culture in China for millennia, and it is likely that hybrids came into being in gardens, where different wild tree peony species were planted closely together. They are used in China both for medicine and as an ornamental, particularly the hybrids called Paeonia suffruticosa. These hybrids in particular, but other tree peonies too are called 牡丹 (mu dan) in China.|$|E

Furthermore, {{it has been reported that}} Cortex <b>Moutan</b> has anticancer effect. In this study, the Cortex <b>Moutan</b> extract was evaluated in bladder cancer therapy in vitro and in vivo. Cortex <b>Moutan</b> extract reduces cell viability with IC 50 between 1 ~ 2 [*]mg/ml in bladder cancer cells, and it has lower cytotoxicity in normal urotheliums. It arrests cells in G 1 and S phase and causes phosphatidylserine expression in the outside of cell membrane.

40|$|Abstract <b>Moutan</b> Cortex Radicis, {{the root}} bark of Paeonia × suffruticosa Andrews, Paeoniaceae, {{has been widely}} used in {{traditional}} medicine therapy. Although {{it has been shown}} to possess many pharmacological activities, the molecular mechanisms of its anti-cancer activity have not been clearly elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the pro-apoptotic effects of the ethanol extract of <b>Moutan</b> Cortex Radicis in human gastric cancer AGS cells. <b>Moutan</b> Cortex Radicis treatment inhibited the cell viability of AGS cells in a concentration-dependent manner, which was associated with apoptotic cell death. <b>Moutan</b> Cortex Radicis's induction of apoptosis was connected with the upregulation of death receptor 4, death receptor 5, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, Fas ligand, and Bax, and the downregulation of Bcl- 2 and Bid. <b>Moutan</b> Cortex Radicis treatment also induced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), the proteolytic activation of caspases (- 3, - 8, and - 9), and the degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, an activated caspase- 3 substrate protein. However, the pre-treatment of a caspase- 3 inhibitor significantly attenuated <b>Moutan</b> Cortex Radicis-induced apoptosis and cell viability reduction. In addition, <b>Moutan</b> Cortex Radicis treatment effectively activated the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signaling pathway; however, a specific inhibitor of AMPK significantly reduced <b>Moutan</b> Cortex Radicis-induced apoptosis. Overall, the results suggest that the apoptotic activity of <b>Moutan</b> Cortex Radicis may be associated with a caspase-dependent cascade through the activation of both extrinsic and intrinsic signaling pathways connected with adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase activation, and <b>Moutan</b> Cortex Radicis as an activator of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase could be a prospective application to treat human cancers...|$|E
40|$|<b>Moutan</b> Cortex, {{a widely}} used {{traditional}} Chinese medicine {{for the treatment}} of various diseases, is the root bark of Paeonia suffruticosa Andrews (Paeoniaceae).

Otherwise, there are few reports about the active compounds with anti-inflammatory activity of <b>Moutan</b> Cortex. The aim {{of the present study was}} to screen and identify bioactive compounds with anti-inflammatory effect from <b>Moutan</b> Cortex. With the aid of preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique, ethyl acetate and ethanol extract of <b>Moutan</b> Cortex were isolated into twenty-two fractions. Bioactivities of these fractions were evaluated by measuring expression of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) in rat synoviocytes subjected to interleukin- 1 b (IL- 1 b). Eight compounds were isolated from six active fractions and identified by HPLC/MSn. Purified compounds, paeoniflorin, paeonol and pentagalloylglucose resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of TNF-a synthesis and IL- 6 production in synoviocytes treated with proinflamma-tory mediator.

These compounds were identified by their characteristic UV profiles and the mass spectroscopy data, and their con-tents were determined by HPLC. The chromatographic separation was performed on a C 18 column by gradient elution with 0. 05 % formic acid in water and acetonitrile. The methodological validation gave acceptable linearities (r = 0. 9996) and recoveries (ranging from 99. 4 ∼ 103. 1 %). The limits of detection (LOD) of these compounds ranged from 10 to 30 µg/mL.

Objective: To establish a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprint method for the quality control of Radix Paeonia Alba, Radix Paeonia Rubra, and Cortex <b>Moutan,</b> and to compare their main constituents. Materials and Methods: The separations of Radix Paeoniae Alba, Radix Paeoniae Rubra, and Cortex <b>Moutan</b> was carried out, respectively, through a gradient elution using a monolithic column and a mobile phase consisting of water (containing 0. 1 % formic acid) and acetonitrile (containing 0. 1 % formic acid) at a flow rate of 5. 0 ml/min. The detection wavelength was set at 230 nm. The data calculation was performed with CHROMAP v 1. 51 and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 18. 0 software for principal component analysis. Results: A rapid separation method based on high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD) with monolithic columns and a fingerprint analysis method was established.

In our research, with a simulated atmosphere air condition, the partial carbonization processes of three Chinese herb medicines rhubarb, <b>moutan</b> and burnet were simulated at different heating rates (5, 10 and 20 °C • min- 1) and analyzed by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) to quantify the upper limits of the temperature. The activation energy was calculated with Friedman, Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) method and Ozawa-Flynn-Wall (OFW) methods in iso-conversional models and independent parallel reaction model (IPR). The upper temperatures were calculated to be 280, 184 and 246 °C for rhubarb, <b>moutan</b> and burnet, respectively, at corresponding conversion rates of 0. 4, 0. 2 and 0. 1. Calculation of the activation energy has been found impossible with the IPR model. Results obtained from the three iso-conversional methods were different.

40|$|The {{chromosome}} number and karyotype of three populations in Paeonia intermedia C. A. Mey {{are presented in}} this paper. The populations, sampled from Altai Prefecture in Xinjiang, China, are diploids (2 n = 10), with 2 A type karyotype and the karyotypic formula of 2 n = 2 x = 10 = 6 m + 2 sm + 2 st. There was no obvious differentiation among all the three sections of the genus Paeonia based on parameters of arm ratio and ratio of the longest/shortest chromosome (L 1 /Ln). There is merely slight difference between the woody section (Sect. <b>Moutan)</b> and the herbaceous sections (Sects. Onaepia and Paeonia). The genus Paeonia L.

40|$|Abstract: Increasing {{studies suggest}} that {{inflammatory}} processes in {{the central nervous system}} mediated by microglial activation {{plays an important role in}} numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Development of planning for microglial suppression is considered a key strategy in the search for neuroprotection. Paeonol is a major phenolic component of <b>Moutan</b> Cortex, widely used as a nutrient supplement in Chinese medicine. In this study, we investigated the effects of paeonol on microglial cells stimulated by OPEN ACCESS Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015, 16 8845 inflammagens. Paeonol significantly inhibited the release of nitric oxide (NO) and the expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Currently {{there is}} growing use of {{complementary}} and alternative anticancer medicines worldwide, and considerable interest in finding anticancer drugs among Chinese medicinal herbs. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the antitumor activity of the root bark of Paeonia <b>moutan</b> (RBPM) in human squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. Cell lines derived from human oral squamous cell carcinoma (HSC 2, 3, 4, SAS) were tested with different concentrations of RBPM (1 - 100 μg/ml) using a series of in vitro assay systems. RBPM at a concentration of 100 μg/ml inhibited monolayer and anchorage-independent growth, and interrupted coordinated migration. RBPM activated the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and serine/threonine kinase AKT in 30 min; then, at a later stage (after 6 hours) exhibited potent cytostatic, pro-apoptoti...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} recent 20 years' herbal {{administration}} rules in TCM treatments of ovarian cysts (OCs) {{based on data}} mining. Methods: A prescription database for ovarian cysts was established by ACCESS 2007. Importing the database into SPSS 17. 0 and SPSS Modeler 14. 1. SPSS 17. 0 was used for descriptive and cluster analyses, while SPSS Modeler 14. 1 was used for association rules analysis. Results: After screening, 363 prescriptions were obtained. The 10 most frequently-used Chinese herbal medicines are Zedoaria (Rhizoma Curcumae), Poria cocos (Poria), Common buried rubber (Rhizoma Sparganii), Red peony root (Radix Paeoniae Rubra), Peach seed (Semen Persicae), Danggui (Radix Angelicae Sinensis), Chinese angelica (Ramulus Cinnamomi), Liquorice root (Radix Glycyrrhizae), Pangolin scales (Squama Manis) and <b>Moutan</b> cortex (Cortex <b>Moutan</b> Radicis); the 5 most common syndromes of OCs are qi stagnation and blood stasis, phlegm and blood stasis, uterine blood stasis, stagnation of liver qi and retention of phlegm and dampness, nearly to 54. 26 %; In association rules analysis, 5 sets of two-herbs association rules were obtained, 17 sets of three-herbs association rules were obtained, 22 sets of four-herbs association rules were obtained and 4 sets of five-herbs association rules were obtained; By clustering, 13 sets of core couplet medicinals were obtained. Conclusion: Medicinal herbs for promoting blood circulation to remove blood stasis, resolve hard lumps, for strengthening the spleen, eliminating phlegm, and relieving liver qi stagnation were highly used {{in the treatment of}} OCs; Herbs attributed to the Liver Meridian, the Spleen Meridian and the Heart Meridian were highly used in OCs; The compatibility of herbs for promoting blood circulation to remove blood stasis and resolve hard lumps were highly used; Guizhi Fuling Wan (GFW) was often used and combined with other herbs in the treatment of OCs...|$|E

40|$|Paeonol is {{an active}} {{component}} of <b>Moutan</b> Cortex Radicis and is widely used as an analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory agent in traditional Chinese medicine. We wanted to determine the role of paeonol in treating adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We established an acute lung injury (ALI) model in Sprague-Dawley rats, which was similar to ARDS in humans, using intratracheal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The intraperitoneal administration of paeonol successfully reduced histopathological scores and attenuated myeloperoxidase-reactive cells as an index of polymorphonuclear neutrophils infiltration and also reduces inducible {{nitric oxide synthase expression}} in the lung tissue, at 16 [*]h after LPS administration. In addition, paeonol reduced proinflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, including tumor-necrosis factor-α, interleukin- 1 β, interleukin- 6, and plasminogen-activated inhibition factor- 1. These results indicated that paeonol successfully attenuates inflammatory and coagulation reactions to protect against ALI...|$|E
40|$|Advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) {{are largely}} {{involved}} in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. It is apparent that inhibition of AGEs formation is important in preventing the occurrence and progression of nephropathy. Therefore, to seek possible AGEs inhibitors in Oriental medicines, we began our investigation with an in vitro evaluation system. Among the 12 Oriental medical prescriptions examined, Ompi-to inhibited AGEs formation to the greatest extent, followed by Tokaku-joki-to and Keishi-bukuryo-gan and Daio-botampi-to in that order. Among the 21 component galenicals examined, Rhei Rhizoma, Cinnamomi Cortex, <b>Moutan</b> Cortex and Paeoniae Radix all had a potent inhibitory action, indicating that Rhei Rhizoma, vascular system disturbance -eliminating drugs and tannin-containing crude drugs can all inhibit the formation of AGEs. These Oriental prescriptions and component galenicals proved to have more potent inhibitory activity than the positive control aminoguanidine. advanced glycation endproducts(AGE) は糖尿病性腎症の成因に大きく関与しており,AGE生成の抑制が腎症発症・進展防止に重要であることが知られている。このことから,本研究ではAGE阻害薬の可能性を和漢薬に求め,in vitroの評価系で検討した。使用した漢方方剤 12 種類のうち,最もAGE生成を抑制した漢方方剤は温脾湯で,次いで桃核承気湯,桂枝茯苓丸,大黄牡丹皮湯の順であった。実験に供した 21 種類の構成生薬では大黄,桂皮,牡丹皮,芍薬に強い抑制作用を認め,大黄剤,駆〓血剤ならびにタンニン生薬がAGEの生成を抑制しているものと考えられた。またこれらは陽性対照物質のアミノグアニジンより強い活性を示した...|$|E
