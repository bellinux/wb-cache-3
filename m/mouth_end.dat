5000|$|Blunts {{originally}} {{got their}} name from their [...] "broad or rounded tip", and were named as such in the 19th century to differentiate them from other cigars with a tapered, pointed tip. Blunts are a specific size cigar {{that have been}} so popular as to have been once sold in specific vending machines. The original blunt cigar was manufactured in Philadelphia out of a single leaf outer tobacco wrapper. At the time {{this was the only}} cigar wrapped in one continuous leaf, other cigars used pieces of leaves for their outer wrapper. Tobacco leaves naturally taper at the ends. Since this cigar was rolled in one leaf the end would taper and had a round appearance (thus leading to the Blunt name). Due to the popularity of this style of cigar many other Blunts were launched into the marketplace. Brands of blunts include: Phillies, Dutch Masters, Backwoods, White Owl, Altadis marketing [...] "Antonio Y Cleopatra", [...] "El Producto", and [...] "Tampa Nugget" [...] brands, Swedish Match marketing [...] "Game" [...] and [...] "Garcia Y Vega" [...] brands, and Swisher Sweets marketing [...] "King Edward", [...] "Optimo", and Pom Pom brands. These types of cigars are commonly sold in convenience stores, gas stations, grocery stores, and drugstores, in contrast to premium cigars, which are sold in cigar shops. Blunts burn quickly like cigarettes, and some can be smoked in about five minutes, whereas a premium cigar takes an hour or so to burn. Unlike premium cigars, blunts are either already cut or have a hole in the <b>mouth</b> <b>end</b> for the smoke to go through, and so they {{do not need to be}} cut at the <b>mouth</b> <b>end.</b> Blunts are also significantly cheaper than premium cigars.|$|E
50|$|Each female fly can lay up to 500 {{eggs in a}} lifetime, {{in several}} batches of about 75 to 150. The eggs are white and are about 1.2 mm in length. Within a day, larvae (maggots) hatch from the eggs; they live and feed on (usually dead and decaying) organic material, such as garbage, carrion, or feces. They are pale-whitish, 3-9 mm long, thinner at the <b>mouth</b> <b>end,</b> and legless. Their life cycle ranges from two weeks to three months. At {{the end of their}} fourth instar, the maggots crawl to a dry, cool place and {{transform}} into pupae, coloured reddish or brown and about 8 mm long. The adult flies then emerge from the pupae. (This whole cycle is known as complete metamorphosis.) The adults live from two weeks to a month in the wild, or longer in benign laboratory conditions. Having emerged from the pupae, the flies cease to grow; small flies are not necessarily young flies, but are instead the result of getting insufficient food during the larval stage.|$|E
50|$|The second method, as {{described}} by the IARC monographs, {{used to measure the}} carcinogenicity of cigarette smoke to animals is by exposing them to mainstream cigarette smoke. The IARC monographs define mainstream cigarette smoke as that which is emitted by the <b>mouth</b> <b>end</b> of the cigarette and therefore the smoke that human smokers would be exposed to most. The IARC monographs describe the methods and equipment that scientists have developed to make more effective and standardize the deliverance of mainstream cigarette smoke. These devices vary between whole-body and nose-only exposure, but typically involve machine smoked cigarette smoke being pumped into a small chamber that contains the animal test subjects. A variety of factors differentiate the experience of a human smoker from these animal test subjects'. Human smokers inhale smoke voluntarily and therefore do so more deeply than do animal test subjects which typically adopt short, shallow breaths when exposed to smoke. The animal test subjects, primarily rodents and dogs, also have significantly morphologically different upper respiratory system from humans. Despite these variables, the doses of smoke administered to these animals can be determined by examining tissue and blood samples. Dogs, which cannot be exposed to cigarette smoke via inhalation chambers as easily as can small rodents, require different methods of cigarette smoke exposure. These methods include thracheostomy, in which smoke is pumped through a tube directly into a hole cut in the dog's throat, or through a mask fitted to the dog's face.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Examination {{of tobacco}} butts and its {{possible}} use in tobacco control. DESIGN: Macroscopic examination of cigarette butts collected outside or in dedicated smoking rooms of a smoke-free hospital. RESULTS: Of 925 butts, 3. 8 % were cigarillos, 11. 1 % cigarettes without filter, 57. 7 % ventilated filter cigarettes, 22. 5 % filter cigarettes without macroscopic ventilation and 4. 9 % undetermined. Thirty-six different cigarette brands were identified. A wide distribution of butt lengths (mean 32. 1 mm, variation coefficient 28 %), peripheral ovalisation of the filter in 83. 9 %, and extended browning of the <b>mouth</b> <b>end</b> of the filter in 48. 6 % were observed. Vent holes were macroscopically detectable in 70. 5 % {{and a sharp}} decrease in browning in 53. 4 % of the filter cigarettes. Most (94. 7 %) ventilation holes were located at > or = 10 mm from the <b>mouth</b> <b>end.</b> CONCLUSIONS: In a smoke-free hospital, the use of tobacco products (mainly ventilated filter cigarettes) remains sizeable. Given the wide distribution of butt lengths, the number of cigarettes per day is a poor marker of toxin intake. Vent-hole localisation and signs of vent-blocking confirm the inadequacy of machine-measured smoke yields {{and the presence of}} compensatory smoking. More intensive individual cessation advice with pharmacological support is necessary. Examination of a smoker's own cigarette butts {{can be used as a}} tool for individual cessation advice...|$|E

40|$|A {{sampling}} {{system has been}} set up to monitor a group of volatile smoke analytes (nitric oxide, acetaldehyde, acetone, benzene, toluene, 1, 3 butadiene, isoprene and carbon dioxide) from mainstream cigarette smoke on a puff-resolved basis. The system was able to record gas evolution profiles during puffing and interpuff periods without interruption (e. g. taking clearing puffs). Gas phase smoke analytes were sampled as close to the <b>mouth</b> <b>end</b> of the cigarette filter as possible in order to minimise any dead volume effect. The results revealed that, for some volatile species, a significant fraction (e. g. up to 30 % for benzene) in the cigarette mainstream smoke had been generated during the preceding smoulder period. These species were trapped or absorbed within the cigarette rod and then subsequently eluted during the puff. The identification of the two sources of the mainstream smoke, a smouldering source and a puffing source, has not been reported before.

40|$|During smoking of cigarettes, cigars, {{pipes and}} other tobacco products, in {{addition}} to the mainstream smoke drawn and inhaled by smokers, a stream of smoke is released between puffs into the air from the burning cone. Once released, this stream (also known as the sidestream smoke) is mixed with exhaled mainstream smoke as well as the air in an indoor environment to form the secondhand smoke to which both smokers and nonsmokers are exposed. A small additional contribution to the smoke issues from the tip of the cigarette and through the cigarette paper during puffing and through the paper and from the <b>mouth</b> <b>end</b> of the cigarette between puffs (IARC, 1986; NRC, 1986; US EPA, 1992). Thus, secondhand tobacco smoke is composed of aged exhaled mainstream smoke and diluted sidestream smoke. Secondhand tobacco smoke contains a variable proportion of exhaled mainstream smoke ranging from 1 to 43 % (Baker & Proctor, 1990). Because of its rapid dilution and dispersion into the indoor environment, secondhand tobacco smoke acquires different physicochemical properties to those of mainstream smoke and sidestream smoke and the concentrations of the individual constituents are decreased. The principal physical chang...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} two zeolites, HUSY, NaY and a {{mesoporous}} synthesized Al-MCM- 41 {{material on the}} smoke composition of ten commercial cigarettes brands has been studied. Cigarettes were prepared by mixing the tobacco with the three powdered materials, and the smoke obtained under the ISO conditions was analyzed. Up to 32 compounds were identified and quantified in the gas fraction and 80 in the total particulate matter (TPM) condensed in the cigarettes filters and in the traps located after the <b>mouth</b> <b>end</b> of the cigarettes. Al-MCM- 41 {{is by far the}} best additive, providing the highest reductions of the yield for most compounds and brands analyzed. A positive correlation was observed among the TPM and nicotine yields with the reduction obtained in nicotine, CO, and most compounds with the three additives. The amount of ashes in additive free basis increases due to the coke deposited on the solids, especially with Al-MCM- 41. Nicotine is reduced with Al-MCM- 41 by an average of 34. 4 % for the brands studied (49. 5 % for the brand where the major reduction was obtained and 18. 5 for the brand behaving the worst).
