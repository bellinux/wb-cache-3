5|$|Immediately {{after the}} collapse, help came from <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> in the seven-county Minneapolis–Saint Paul {{metropolitan}} area and emergency response personnel, charities, and volunteers. Within {{a few days}} of the collapse, the Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) planned a replacement bridge, the I-35W Saint Anthony Falls Bridge. Construction was completed rapidly, and it opened on September 18, 2008.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 2:42a.m. on November 18, 1999, the 59-foot high stack, {{consisting of}} about 5000logs, collapsed during construction. Of the 58students and former students {{working on the}} stack, 12 were killed and 27 were injured. Immediately after the collapse, Emergency Medical Technicians and trained First Responders of the Texas A Emergency Care Team (TAMECT), a student-run, volunteer service, who staffed each stage of construction, administered first aid. TAMECT alerted the University Police and University EMS (also a student-run service), who dispatched all remaining university medics, and requested <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> from the surrounding agencies.|$|E

50|$|The Provident {{companies}} {{was founded}} in Chattanooga, Tennessee in May 1887 as <b>Mutual</b> Medical <b>Aid</b> and Accident Insurance Company. The company originally specialized in providing both medical-aid and accident insurance to employees in high-risk industries, including miners and coal workers. Within a few months, the company’s founders became concerned that a single disease epidemic would bankrupt the company. <b>Mutual</b> Medical <b>Aid</b> and Accident purchased back all outstanding medical-aid policies and reincorporated as Provident Accident Insurance Company.

5|$|The University Police Department {{provides}} 24-hour {{law enforcement}} and security, campus escort service, motorist assistance, educational programs, and crime prevention information for the BGSU campus and surrounding areas. The department is staffed by 24 full-time, state-certified police officers granted full police authority by the Ohio Revised Code. In addition to the officers, the department includes a student safety services staff that provides services for the university community, such as crowd control and the campus escort service. The department deploys uniformed officers to patrol the campus in marked police cars, bicycles, and on foot and has a <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> agreement with the Bowling Green City Police and with all other state university police departments in Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Syracuse University Ambulance, {{commonly}} referred to as SUA, is a SU Health Services-based student organization that responds to over 1,500 medical emergencies each year. Providing intermediate life support (ILS), rapid cardiac defibrillation, emergency and nonemergency transportation, and special event standby services, SUA operates two full-time transporting ambulances, a supervisor's fly car, and a MCI trailer for mass-casualty incidents. Additionally, SUA operates four transport vans for non-emergency transports. Advanced life support (ALS) <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> is provided by the City of Syracuse's private EMS provider, Rural/Metro Medical Services. SUA was formed in 1973 by a group of students out of a need for emergency medical services on campus. Starting with only a few members and meager equipment, the Syracuse University Medical Crisis Unit was formed. The organization has evolved greatly over time but, with 70+ volunteer students, remains a student-run organization to this day. SUA provides emergency and non-emergency services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week during the academic school year and is funded by a portion of the student health fee.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{group work}} {{practice}} {{continues to be}} informed {{by the work of}} early pioneers and the vanguards of the 1960s and 1970s. In addition to the <b>Mutual</b> <b>Aid</b> Model of social work with groups, the Cognitive-Behavioral Group Work Model is recognized as influential on contemporary group work practice (Rose, 2004). The approach suggested by Rose (1989, 2004) integrates cognitive and behavioral interventions with small group strategies. While primacy is not placed on establishing the group as a <b>mutual</b> <b>aid</b> system in quite the same way as with the <b>Mutual</b> <b>Aid</b> Model, Rose (2004) suggests the worker promote group discussion and member interaction. Furthermore, drawing upon Yalom's Therapeutic Factor construct Rose (2004) points out the benefits of universality, altruism, and group cohesion as well as mutual reinforcement, factors which are conceptually resonant with <b>mutual</b> <b>aid.</b>|$|E

50|$|Westermarck {{argues that}} {{marriage}} is a social institution that rests on a biological foundation, and developed through {{a process in which}} human males came to live together with human females for sexual gratification, companionship, <b>mutual</b> economic <b>aid,</b> procreation, and the joint rearing of offspring.|$|R
30|$|Community {{development}} (CD) gained considerable impetus in {{the colonial}} era {{for a number of}} reasons. The first reason relates {{to the success of the}} farmers’ co-operatives that had been established between 1929 and 1931 (Brown 1984). Most of the cocoa farmers who belonged to co-operatives relied on traditional techniques of self-help and <b>mutual</b> <b>aids</b> (called nnoboa) to prepare the cocoa beans for fermentation and drying. Also, basic services and infrastructures in rural areas (such as clinics, schools, feeder roads, and water) were poor. Their poor condition necessitated a CD strategy that relied on indigenous resources. Adult literacy was promoted through CD campaigns. The programme captured the enthusiasm of the ‘educated few’ in the villages—including teachers, clerks, and store-keepers and persuaded them to act as volunteer teachers (Bonye et al. 2013).|$|R
50|$|In Santiago, {{the first}} Islamic {{institution}} of Chile, the Society of Muslim Union of Chile (Sociedad Unión Musulmana), {{was founded on}} 25 September 1926. Later, on 16 October 1927, the Society of <b>Mutual</b> <b>Aids</b> and Islamic Charity was established. With the 1952 census, the number of Muslims had risen again to 956. The majority lived in Santiago, {{with the rest of}} the population scattered in the provinces of Antofagasta, Coquimbo, Valparaíso, O'Higgins, Concepción, Malleco, Cautín and Valdivia, without much organization among them. Their numbers decreased again, so that by 1960 there were only 522, with the majority of 209 living in Santiago. A decade later, the number of Muslims had increased to 1,431. However, the census did not indicate whether they were men or women, nationals or foreigners. Nevertheless, they were spread throughout the country.|$|R
25|$|<b>Mutual</b> <b>aid</b> {{is often}} erroneously {{understood}} as simply {{the exchange of}} support. <b>Mutual</b> <b>aid</b> is better conceptualized as multidimensional with at least 10 types of processes or activities that occur amongst and between members, including: sharing data, the dialectic process, discussion of taboo topics, the {{all in the same}} boat phenomenon, developing a universal perspective, mutual support, mutual demand (including confrontation), rehearsal of new skills, individual problem solving, and the strengths in numbers phenomenon (Gitterman, 2004; Shulman, 2006; Steinberg, 2004).|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Mutual-aided target {{tracking}} and identification (ID) schemes are described by exploiting the couplings between the {{target tracking}} and object ID systems, which are typically implemented separately. A hybrid state space approach is formulated {{to deal with}} continuous-valued kinematics, discrete-valued target type, and discrete-valued target pose (inherently continuous but quantized). We identify ten possible <b>mutual</b> <b>aiding</b> mechanisms with different complexity in different levels. The coupled tracker design is illustrated {{within the context of}} using ground moving target indicator (GMTI) and high-range resolution radar (HRRR) measurements as well as digital terrain elevation data (DTED) and road maps. The resulting coupled tracking and ID system is expected to outperform the separately designed systems particularly during target maneuvers, for recovering from temporary data dropout, and in a dense target environment. We simulate HRRR ID support information to assist in pose-model selection of an Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) tracker using GMTI measurements...|$|R

30|$|In Ethiopia, {{varieties}} of such CSOs exist among which Iddirs {{are the most}} widespread, institutions in both {{urban and rural areas}} primarily established to provide <b>mutual</b> <b>aids</b> in burial matters at times of death but also address other community concerns at times (Pankhurst 1998). Similarly, Yan (2004) explained that mutual help is essential to the human race to progress to a full humanity. Only through a reciprocal linkage among people would the progress of the whole human race be possible (Yan 2004). Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that participation in voluntary associations have multiple benefits (Bown (2000). In the same way, Beck and Eichler (2000) emphasized that consensus organizing involves a strategic leadership-building process that develops empowerment and stimulates fresh thinking and action on a range of issues related to poverty (Beck and Eichler 2000). Moreover, Breton (2001) stated that neighbor networks make a bigger contribution to resilience in socio-economically deprived neighborhoods (Breton 2001).|$|R

60|$|One {{instance}} {{of this kind}} came immediately under our notice, where a high-born girl had in early youth given her heart to one of meaner extraction.

They had played together as children, been the confidants of each other's little secrets, <b>mutual</b> <b>aids</b> and consolers in difficulty and sorrow. Love had crept in, noiseless, terrorless at first, till each felt their life bound up in the other, {{and at the same time}} knew that they must part. Their extreme youth, and the purity of their attachment, made them yield with less resistance to the tyranny of circumstances. The father of the fair Juliet separated them; but not until the young lover had promised to remain absent only till he had rendered himself worthy of her, and she had vowed to preserve her virgin heart, his treasure, till he returned to claim and possess it.|$|R
