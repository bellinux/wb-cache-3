This is directly suitable for medical applications only in bone scans (it is taken up by osteoblasts) and some thyroid scans (it is taken up in place of iodine by normal thyroid tissues). In other types of scans relying on Tc-99m, a reducing agent is added to the pertechnetate solution to bring the oxidation state of the Tc down to +3 or +4. Secondly, a ligand is added to form a coordination complex. The ligand is chosen to have an affinity for the specific organ to be targeted. For example, the exametazime complex of Tc in oxidation state +3 is able to cross the blood–brain barrier and flow through the vessels in the brain for cerebral blood flow imaging.

50|$|Free {{radicals}} {{derived from}} mercaptans, called thiyl or thiol radical or <b>mercapto</b> radical, are commonly invoked to explain reactions in organic chemistry and biochemistry. They have the formula RS• where R is an organic substituent such as alkyl or aryl. They arise from {{or can be}} generated {{by a number of}} routes, but the principal method is H-atom abstraction from thiols. Another method involves homolysis of organic disulfides. In biology thiyl radicals are responsible for the formation of the deoxyribonucleic acids, building blocks for DNA. This conversion is catalysed by ribonucleotide reductase (see figure). Thiyl intermediates also are produced by the oxidation of glutathione, an antioxidant in biology. Thiyl radicals are also intermediates in the vulcanization process. For example, the vulcanization of polyisoprene results when <b>mercapto</b> radicals couple forming disulfide and polysulfide crosslinks. Thiyl radicals (sulfur-centred) can transform to carbon-centred radicals via hydrogen atom exchange equilibria. The formation of carbon-centred radicals could lead to protein damage via the formation of C-C bonds or backbone fragmentation.|$|E

50|$|However, close {{attention}} {{is necessary for}} other compounds in the test solution. Some compounds can considerably increase or decrease the solubility of AgX. Examples of compounds that increase the solubility include: cyanide, thiocyanate, thiosulfate, thiourea, amines, ammonia, sulfite, thioether, crown ether. Examples of compounds that reduces the solubility include many organic thiols and nitrogen compounds that do not possess solubilizing group other than <b>mercapto</b> group or the nitrogen site, such as mercaptooxazoles, mercaptotetrazoles, especially 1-phenyl-5-mercaptotetrazole, benzimidazoles, especially 2-mercaptobenzimidazole, benzotriazole, and these compounds further substituted by hydrophobic groups. Compounds such as thiocyanate and thiosulfate enhance solubility when they are present in a sufficiently large quantity, due to formation of highly soluble complex ions, but they also significantly depress solubility when present {{in a very small}} quantity, due to formation of sparingly soluble complex ions.|$|E
50|$|Sulfanyl (•) {{also known}} as the <b>mercapto</b> radical, hydrosulfide radical, or hydridosulfur, is a simple radical {{molecule}} consisting of one hydrogen and one sulfur atom. The radical appears in metabolism in organisms as H2S is detoxified. Sulfanyl {{is one of the top}} three sulfur containing gasses in gas giants such as Jupiter and is very likely to be found in brown dwarfs and cool stars. It was originally discovered by Margaret N. Lewis and John U. White at University of California in 1939. They observed molecular absorption bands around 325 nm belonging to the system designated by 2Σ+ ← 2Πi. They generated the radical by means of a radio frequency discharge in hydrogen sulfide. HS• is formed during the degradation of hydrogen sulfide in the atmosphere of the Earth. This may be a deliberate action to destroy odours or a natural phenomena.|$|E

50|$|Nucleoside phosphoramidites are {{derivatives}} {{of natural}} or synthetic nucleosides. They {{are used to}} synthesize oligonucleotides, relatively short fragments of nucleic acid and their analogs. Nucleoside phosphoramidites were first introduced in 1981 by Beaucage and Caruthers. In order to avoid undesired side reactions, reactive hydroxy and exocyclic amino groups present in natural or synthetic nucleosides are appropriately protected. As long as a nucleoside analog contains at least one hydroxy group, {{the use of the}} appropriate protecting strategy allows one to convert that to the respective phosphoramidite and to incorporate the latter into synthetic nucleic acids. In order to be incorporated {{in the middle of an}} oligonucleotide chain using phosphoramidite strategy, the nucleoside analog have to possess two hydroxy groups or, less often, a hydroxy group and another nucleophilic group (amino or <b>mercapto).</b> Examples include, but are not limited to, alternative nucleotides, LNA, morpholino, nucleosides modified at the 2'-position (OMe, protected NH2, F), nucleosides containing non-canonical bases (hypoxanthine and xanthine contained in natural nucleosides inosine and xanthosine, respectively, tricyclic bases such as G-clamp, etc.) or bases derivatized with a fluorescent group or a linker arm.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{adverse effects of}} Captopril, skin rash and loss of taste, {{are the same as}} caused by mercapto-containing penicillamine. Therefore, a group of {{researchers}} aimed at finding potent, selective ACE inhibitors that wouldn’t contain a <b>mercapto</b> (SH) function and would have a weaker chelating function. They returned to work with carboxyl compounds and started working with substituted N-carboxymethyl-dipeptides as a general structure (R-CHCOOH-A1-A2). According to previous research they assumed that cyclic imino acids would result in good potency if substituted on the carboxyl terminus of the dipeptide. Therefore, substituting A2 with proline gave good results. They also noted that according to the enzyme’s specificity imino acids in the position next to the carboxyl terminus would not give a potent compound. Also noticeable is that by substituting R and A1 groups with hydrophobic and basic residues would give a potent compound. By substituting -NH in the general structure resulted in loss of potency which is consistent to the enzyme’s need for a -NH in corresponding position on the substrates. The results were 2 active inhibitors: Enalaprilat and Lisinopril. These compounds both have phenylalanine in R position which occupies the S1 groove in the enzyme. The result was thus these two new, potent tripeptide analogues with zinc-coordinating carboxyl group: Enalaprilat and Lisinopril.|$|E

Their reactivities for decreasing acrylamide content depended on mercaptan’s molecular structure and acrylamide disappearance decreased in the following order: 1, 2 -ethanedithiol > 2 -methyl- 3 -furanthiol > 1 -butanethiol > 2 -furanmethanethiol. Mercaptans were added to acrylamide to produce the corresponding 3 -(alkylthio) propionamides.
