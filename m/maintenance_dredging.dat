Longshore drift carries sand from south to north during winter and from north to south during summer. Cliff erosion control has often resulted in sand starvation, necessitating offshore dredging to replenish the beach. On the western side of the bay there is a greater variety of beach types, including both sandy and sandstone rock beaches, seen at Queenscliff, St Leonards, Indented Head, Portarlington, Altona and Geelong's Eastern Beach.

Three stations representing contrasting history and presence of <b>maintenance</b> <b>dredge</b> disposal, including a control station outside the disposal site, have been studied and depth profiles of fluxes of different metals (Fe, Mn, Pb, Cu, Cd, Cr, Ni, Zn) to the binding gel (Chelex 100) have been derived. Higher flux rates and shallower mobilisation of metals (Mn and Fe) to the binding gel were observed at the disposal stations compared to the control station. Here we describe metal mobilization at different depths, linking the remobilization of Fe 2 + and Mn 2 + to the sediment (re) supply of other heavy metals of interest {{with a focus on}} Cd, Ni and Pb and as they are on the Water Framework Directive (WFD) list of priority substances and OSPAR list of priority pollutants. Results showed that Cd, Pb and Ni exhibited signs of resupply at the sediment-water interface (SWI). There was a potential increased mobilisation and source to the water column of Pb and Ni at the disposal site stations, but there was no Cd source, despite higher total loadings. This information has the potential to improve our current understanding of metal cycles at disposal sites. This work can be used as an indication of likely metal bioavailability and also assist in determining whether the sites act as sources or sinks of heavy metals.

40|$|Within {{the past}} few decades, {{increased}} population and infrastructure development have necessitated planning the development activities on soft soil deposits. In addition to treating the existing soft soils, new land areas are formed in the sea in order to expand the adjacent facilities such as Airports and Ports. Land reclamation projects are increasingly carried out in a sustainable way by reusing the <b>maintenance</b> <b>dredged</b> mud as filling materials. There are number of large scale land reclamation projects, where <b>maintenance</b> <b>dredged</b> mud is utilised to fill the reclamation site, such as Port of Brisbane expansion project, offshore expansion project at Tokyo international Airport and Kansai international airport development project, to name few. Soft soils show poor load bearing capacity and undergo large settlement under a load application, thus they should be consolidated prior to the commencement of construction activities. The soft layers are preloaded in conjunction with prefabricated vertical drains (PVD) {{to speed up the}} consolidation process. In the case of land reclamation works, the dredged mud slurry is first allowed to undergo sedimentation before it is consolidated. Reliable analysis of time dependent consolidation process and settlement of the soil layer is important to plan ahead the construction activities. Accurate consolidation analysis requires appropriate theories, tools and understanding of the subsoil conditions. Several consolidation theories have been developed to model the consolidation mechanism of soils mathematically, which are solved with boundary conditions relevant to the practical problem to produce mathematical solutions. In the absence of simplistic mathematical solutions, empirical equations and approximations are used to predict the time dependent consolidation and settlement of soil layer. This dissertation focuses on enhancing the consolidation analysis of soft soil layers by the critical review of existing solutions available for the consolidation analysis of single and multi-layers. The standard mathematical solutions available for the radial consolidation of soil layer were developed considering a uniform initial excess pore water pressure distribution in the soil layer. The potential non-uniform excess pore water pressure distributions that can practically occur were not incorporated in the solutions. Within this dissertation, the effect of different non-uniform pore water pressure distributions on the radial consolidation behaviour of a soil layer, where the pore water flow is radially outwards towards a peripheral drain, is analysed through a mathematical study. Graphical solutions are developed for the average degree of consolidation and pore water pressure and degree of consolidation isochrones are plotted. To analyse the time dependent consolidation behaviour of multi-layered soil, empirical equations and approximations have been developed to overcome the difficulties associated with the complex mathematical solutions. These approximations do not have any sound theoretical basis and thus have limitation in their application. Another objective of the dissertation is to investigate the applicability of selected approximation in the consolidation analysis of double layer soil considering different properties, thicknesses and drainage conditions. For this, an error analysis is conducted utilising the advanced soft soil creep model in PLAXIS. One-dimensional consolidation of a double layer system is experimentally modelled in the laboratory. The consolidation tests are simulated in PLAXIS to validate the soft soil creep model. Further, expressions are proposed for the equivalent stiffness parameters of a composite double layer system, which was verified using the results obtained from the experiments and PLAXIS modelling. Sedimentation of soft soil is common in the land reclamations works carried out using dredged mud as filling materials. The initial conditions of the soft soil slurry, such as the water content and salt concentration, influence the settling pattern of particles during the sedimentation. This dissertation presents the extensive laboratory studies conducted to investigate the effect of settling patterns of particles in the final properties of the dredged mud sediment. In the experiments, dredged mud is mixed with sea water and freshwater at different water contents to induce various settling pattern of particles reflecting the sedimentation environment. Series of oedometer tests are conducted for the radial consolidation and vertical consolidation and the compressibility and permeability properties are assessed. From the results the depth variation of the sediment properties and anisotropy between the horizontal and vertical properties are evaluated for the different settling patterns. Further, the dissertation presents a new estimation method to calculate the horizontal coefficient of consolidation from the radial consolidation tests conducted using a peripheral drain. The proposed method was validated using series of radial consolidation tests, which is described in this dissertation...|$|R

Thereafter however the railway increasingly dominated coal and other freight traffic, and trade at Bourton Wharf declined rapidly. Bourton Wharf had a small revival in the 1860s but in 1876 the wharf received only 27 tons of Somerset coal, which equates to a full cargo for only one narrowboat in the entire year.

Landscape management is a means to protect natural resources from the adverse impacts. In particular, the adequate management of ditches could improve crop quality. Here, we review ditch design and maintenance. We found the following major points: (1) ditch networks have been primarily designed for waterlogging control and erosion prevention. Nonetheless, when properly managed, farm ditches provide other important ecosystem services, namely groundwater recharge, flood attenuation, water purification, or biodiversity conservation. (2) All ditch ecosystem services depend on many geochemical, geophysical, and biological processes, whose occurrence and intensity vary largely with ditch characteristics. (3) The major ruling characteristics are vegetative cover; ditch morphology; slope orientation; reach connections such as piped sections and weirs, soil, sediment and litter properties, biota, and biofilms; and network topology. (4) Ditch maintenance is an efficient engineering tool to optimize ecosystem services because several ditch characteristics change widely with ditch maintenance. For instance, <b>maintenance</b> operations, <b>dredging,</b> chemical weeding, and burning improve waterlogging and soil erosion control, but they are negative for biodiversity conservation. Mowing has low adverse effects on biodiversity conservation and water purification when mowing is performed at an adequate season. The effects of burning have been poorly investigated...|$|R
