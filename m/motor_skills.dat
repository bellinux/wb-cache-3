40|$|In <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> learning, it {{is known}} that {{extensive}} practice produces a shift in the brain pathways, and that the existence of memory consolidation, especially, sleep-dependent consolidation, is clearly seen. This paper discussed <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> learning based on some recent reports on these matters. Both of brain pathway shift and consolidation are not exclusive phenomena in <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> learning, but they provide some keys {{to understand the nature of}} <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> learning.

40|$|Relatively {{little is}} known about how {{practice}} relates to children's improvement in gross <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> performance. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine to what extent 6 - and 7 -year-old children improve their gross <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> performance in a four-week period, in which goal-directed learning is stimulated and to determine whether differences between boys and girls occur. Groups of 6 year olds (n = 167) and 7 year olds (n = 140) practiced their gross <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> for four weeks. Physical education teachers stimulated goal-directed learning by their instruction, skill-specific exercises, and individual practice. The week before and after, gross <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> performance was assessed, using the Korper Koordinations Test fur Kinder, and compared with a control group (n = 131). Both 6 and 7 year olds in the intervention group improved their gross <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> performance significantly more than the control group.

5|$|In {{areas where}} there is little iodine in the diet, {{typically}} remote inland areas and semi-arid equatorial climates where no marine foods are eaten, iodine deficiency gives rise to hypothyroidism, symptoms of which are extreme fatigue, goitre, mental slowing, depression, weight gain, and low basal body temperatures. Iodine deficiency {{is the leading cause}} of preventable intellectual disability, a result that occurs primarily when babies or small children are rendered hypothyroidic by a lack of the element. The addition of iodine to table salt has largely eliminated this problem in the wealthier nations, but iodine deficiency remains a serious public health problem today in the developing world. Iodine deficiency is also a problem in certain areas of Europe. Information processing, fine <b>motor</b> <b>skills,</b> and visual problem solving are improved by iodine repletion in moderately iodine-deficient children.|$|E
40|$|<b>Motor</b> <b>skill</b> {{learning}} {{is one of}} the key components of motor function recovery after stroke, especially recovery driven by neurorehabilitation. Transcranial direct current stimulation can enhance neurorehabilitation and <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> learning in stroke patients. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the retention of stimulation-enhanced <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> learning involving a paretic upper limb have not been resolved. These neural substrates were explored by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging. Nineteen chronic hemiparetic stroke patients participated in a double-blind, cross-over randomized, sham-controlled experiment with two series. Each series consisted of two sessions: (i) an intervention session during which dual transcranial direct current stimulation or sham was applied during <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> learning with the paretic upper limb; and (ii) an imaging session 1 week later, during which the patients performed the learned <b>motor</b> <b>skill.</b> The <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> learning task, called the 'circuit game', involves a speed/accuracy trade-off and consists of moving a pointer controlled by a computer mouse along a complex circuit as quickly and accurately as possible. Relative to the sham series, dual transcranial direct current stimulation applied bilaterally over the primary motor cortex during <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> learning with the paretic upper limb resulted in (i) enhanced online <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> learning; (ii) enhanced 1 -week retention; and (iii) superior transfer of performance improvement to an untrained task. The 1 -week retention's enhancement driven by the intervention was associated with a trend towards normalization of the brain activation pattern during performance of the learned <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> relative to the sham series. A similar trend towards normalization relative to sham was observed during performance of a simple, untrained task without a speed/accuracy constraint, despite a lack of behavioural difference between the dual transcranial direct current stimulation and sham series. Finally, dual transcranial direct current stimulation applied during the first session enhanced continued learning with the paretic limb 1 week later, relative to the sham series. This lasting behavioural enhancement was associated with more efficient recruitment of the <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> learning network, that is, focused activation on the motor-premotor areas in the damaged hemisphere, especially on the dorsal premotor cortex. Dual transcranial direct current stimulation applied during <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> learning with a paretic upper limb resulted in prolonged shaping of brain activation, which supported behavioural enhancements in stroke patients...|$|R
40|$|Regular {{physical}} activity {{has a positive}} impact on cognition and brain function. Here we investigated if a single bout of exercise can improve motor memory and <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> learning. We also explored if the timing of the exercise bout in relation to the timing of practice has any impact on the acquisition and retention of a <b>motor</b> <b>skill.</b> Forty-eight young subjects were randomly allocated into three groups, which practiced a visuomotor accuracy-tracking task either before or after a bout of intense cycling or after rest. <b>Motor</b> <b>skill</b> acquisition was assessed during practice and retention was measured 1 hour, 24 hours and 7 days after practice. Differences among groups in the rate of <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> acquisition were not significant. In contrast, both exercise groups showed a significantly better retention of the <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> 24 hours and 7 days after practice. Furthermore, compared to the subjects that exercised before practice, the subjects that exercised after practice showed a better retention of the <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> 7 days after practice. These findings indicate that one bout of intense exercise performed immediately before or after practicing a motor task is sufficient to improve the long-term retention of a <b>motor</b> <b>skill.</b> The positive effects of acute exercise on motor memory are maximized when exercise is performed immediately after practice, during the early stages of memory consolidation. Thus, the timing of exercise in relation to practice is possibly an important factor regulating the effects of acute exercise on long-term motor memory...|$|R
40|$|Different {{memories}} follow different processing pathways. For example, some <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> {{memories are}} enhanced over wakefulness, whereas others are instead enhanced over sleep. The processing pathway that a <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> memory follows may {{be determined by}} functional changes within motor circuits. We tested this idea using transcranial magnetic stimulation to measure corticospinal excitability at 6, 21, 36, 96, and 126 min after participants learnt tasks that either were or were not enhanced over wakefulness. There was no change in corticospinal excitability after learning a <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> that was subsequently enhanced; whereas, there was a substantial transient decrease in corticospinal excitability after learning a <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> that was not enhanced. In subsequent experiments, we abolished the decrease in corticospinal excitability by applying theta burst stimulation to either the dorsolateral prefrontal or primary motor cortex, and induced <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> improvements during consolidation. The <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> improvements in each experiment were correlated with the corticospinal excitability after learning. Together, these experiments suggest that corticospinal excitability changes act as a physiological signal, which prevents improvements from developing over wakefulness, and so when this signal is abolished improvements are induced. Our observations show that the human brain can actively prevent the processing of memories, and provides insights into the mechanisms that control the fate of memories...|$|R
5|$|People of {{all ages}} with {{physical}} and mental disabilities obtain beneficial results from association with horses. Therapeutic riding is used to mentally and physically stimulate disabled persons and help them improve their lives through improved balance and coordination, increased self-confidence, and a greater feeling of freedom and independence. The benefits of equestrian activity {{for people with disabilities}} has also been recognized with the addition of equestrian events to the Paralympic Games and recognition of para-equestrian events by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI). Hippotherapy and therapeutic horseback riding are names for different physical, occupational, and speech therapy treatment strategies that utilize equine movement. In hippotherapy, a therapist uses the horse's movement to improve their patient's cognitive, coordination, balance, and fine <b>motor</b> <b>skills,</b> whereas therapeutic horseback riding uses specific riding skills.|$|E

5|$|Newborn {{children}} with hypothyroidism may have normal birth weight and height (although the head may {{be larger than}} expected and the posterior fontanelle may be open). Some may have drowsiness, decreased muscle tone, a hoarse-sounding cry, feeding difficulties, constipation, an enlarged tongue, umbilical hernia, dry skin, a decreased body temperature and jaundice. A goiter is rare, although it may develop later in children who have a thyroid gland that does not produce functioning thyroid hormone. A goiter may also develop in children growing up in areas with iodine deficiency. Normal growth and development may be delayed, and not treating infants may lead to an intellectual impairment (IQ 6–15 points lower in severe cases). Other problems include the following: large scale and fine <b>motor</b> <b>skills</b> and coordination, reduced muscle tone, squinting, decreased attention span, and delayed speaking.

40|$|Contrary to researchers' current {{focus on}} {{individual}} <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> learning, in institutional settings such as {{physical education and}} sports <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> learning is often taught in groups. In these settings, there {{is not only the}} interaction between teacher and learner (analogous to research), but also the many interactions between the learners in the group. In this paper, we discuss the pitfalls of applying research findings without taking into account the different dynamics that the interactions between group members bring about. To this end, we especially discuss implicit motor learning and self-controlled feedback, as these have recently been hailed as being particularly effective for increasing <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> and self-efficacy. Proposals are provided to adopt these methods for <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> learning in groups.

5|$|Mu {{waves are}} thought to be {{indicative}} of an infant’s developing ability to imitate. This is important because the ability to imitate plays a vital {{role in the development of}} <b>motor</b> <b>skills,</b> tool use, and understanding causal information through social interaction. Mimicking is integral in the development of social skills and understanding nonverbal cues. Causal relationships can be made through social learning without requiring experience firsthand. In action execution, mu waves are present in both infants and adults before and after the execution of a motor task and its accompanying desynchronization. While executing a goal-oriented action, however, infants exhibit a higher degree of desynchronization than do adults. Just as with an action execution, during action observation infants’ mu waves not only show a desynchronization, but show a desynchronization greater in degree than the one evidenced in adults. This tendency for changes in degree of desynchronization, rather than actual changes in frequency, becomes the measure for mu wave development throughout adulthood, although the most changes take place during the first year of life. Understanding the mechanisms that are shared between action perception and execution in the earliest years of life has implications for language development. Learning and understanding through social interaction comes from imitating movements as well as vowel sounds. Sharing the experience of attending to an object or event with another person can be a powerful force in the development of language.|$|E

50|$|While {{the precise}} neural basis for <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> {{consolidation}} {{is not fully}} understood, many of the structures necessary for the process have been identified. As {{the process of learning}} a <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> requires both initial execution of the skill, as well as long storage of the consolidated memory, a complex network of brain areas are involved, including the primary motor cortex, the cerebellum, the prefrontal cortex, and the basal ganglia. Given that <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> consolidation is a distributed process, the ability to form new procedural memories is susceptible to the effects of a number of processes and pathologies.|$|R

The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of a {{training}} package, which consisted of the Flex Grid Teaching Model along with adapted physical education consultation, on special education teacher instruction of functional <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> acquisition instruction to secondary students with low incidence disabilities. Special education teachers were trained on use of the Flex Grid Teaching Model for functional <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> acquisition instruction in addition to receiving adapted physical education consultation to support teacher planning and instruction. In this study, I investigated the extent to which the training package increased teacher use of three teaching methods (systematic prompting, specific reinforcement plan, chained individualized task analysis sequence) designed to support functional <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> acquisition. Using a multiple baseline across subjects design, teacher performance providing functional <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> acquisition instruction across baseline and intervention phases was measured. Results indicated a functional relationship exists between the training package and an increase in teacher performance to provide functional <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> acquisition instruction to secondary students with low incidence disabilities. Teacher performance for delivering systematic prompting teaching methods also increased upon receiving the training package. Although further investigation is needed, this study showed that use of the Flex Grid Teaching Model along with adapted physical education consultation can benefit special education teachers tasked with providing functional <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> acquisition instruction to secondary students with low incidence disabilities...|$|R

25|$|Finally, motor-skill {{rehabilitation}} {{has been}} proposed as another possible way in which games {{can be used for}} rehabilitation purposes. Stroke patients suffering upper extremity motor difficulties have been the primary focus of this subject and, in this case, a variety of gaming environments have been experimented with. Output has shown that their Fugl-Meyer UE scores and their Functional Independence Measure scale score increase after a period of engaging in virtual rehabilitation, suggesting that their mobility dysfunction decreased and their degree of independence increased due to the intervention. Additionally, output has suggested improved <b>motor</b> <b>skills</b> on a higher level, having several researchers suggesting positive improvements in their stroke patients as a result of virtual rehabilitation methods. At this higher level, researchers have suggested improved ability to walk, or ambulation, and improved use of larger <b>motor</b> <b>skills</b> after intervention. One other class of patients that has been studied less frequently in this category of rehabilitation is cerebral palsy patients. Ability to walk certain distances without the use of an assistive device was the method of measurement for this category. After a period of working with a Wii-based system, it was shown that a patient who struggled with walking large distances before, was able to walk a noticeably longer distance. This suggests an improvement in larger <b>motor</b> <b>skills,</b> whereas the stroke patients demonstrated an improvement in finer <b>motor</b> <b>skills,</b> focused strictly on their use of upper extremities during the gaming rehabilitation.|$|E

Seven infants with Down syndrome (DS) and seven infants with typical development were assessed at the ages of 4, 5 and 6 months. The following variables were analyzed: straightness index, mean velocity, movement units and deceleration time (for reaching movements), grasping frequency and AIMS scores. Intrinsic factors such as age and DS were found to influence the development of reaching, grasping, and of the overall level of gross <b>motor</b> <b>skill.</b> The overall level of gross <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> was observed to influence grasping. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Although {{significant}} {{attention has}} been paid to promoting the importance of physi-cal activity in children, adolescents, and adults, we do not currently understand how to promote sustained physical activity levels throughout the lifespan. We contend that previous research has failed to consider the dynamic and synergistic role that <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> competence plays in the initiation, maintenance, or decline of physical activity and how this role might change across developmental time. In this article, we present a conceptual model hypothesizing the relationships among physical activity, <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> competence, perceived <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> competence, health-related physical fitness, and obesity. We contend that the development of <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> competence is a primary underlying mechanism that promotes engage-ment in physical activity.

40|$|Experts in a skill produce movement-related {{cortical}} potentials (MRCPs) {{of smaller}} amplitude and later onset than novices. This may indicate that, following long-term training, experts require less effort to plan <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> performance. However, no longitudinal evidence exists {{to support this}} claim.

We found that cortical activation during performance of the unskilled movement was increased in the patients relative to controls in the contralesional primary sensorimotor cortex. Performance of the skilled movement elicited increased activation in the patients rel-ative to controls in the contralesional primary sensorimotor cortex, ventral premotor cortex, supplementary motor area/cingulate, and occipitoparietal cortex. Further, the activation change in the contralesional occipitoparietal cortex was greater in the patients relative to controls {{with the increase in}} <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> challenge. Ki-nematic differences, mirror movements, and residual motor deficits did not account for the enhanced activation in the contralesional cortices in the patients. These results suggest that activation in the contralesional cortical network was enhanced as a function of <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> challenge in stroke patients with good motor recovery. The findings of the current study suggest that successful recovery of <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> after hemiparetic stroke involves participation of the contralesional cortical network...|$|R
