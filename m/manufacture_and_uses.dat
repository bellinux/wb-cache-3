30|$|Over the years, the {{frequency}} of pest and disease outbreaks in crops has reportedly increased. With inadequate water supply, termites raid wheat. Another pest, powdery mildew also infests mustard. To contain the pest outbreaks, insecticides such as DDT, BHC, Aldrin, Dieldrin, Endrin, Endosulfan and herbicides such as 2, 4 -Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid is used. Endosulfan has been banned for <b>manufacture</b> <b>and</b> <b>uses</b> under Stockholm convention in April 2011 for its human and environmental implications. More than 75 countries have banned it, even prior to the ban was agreed upon at the Convention. However, it is still used in India, China, {{and a few other}} countries. Aldrin and Dieldrin have been banned in India since 2003 (Mustafa et al. 2010). Monocrotophos was also used in the crop fields around KNP, and there were incidences of bird mortality (Sarus crane Grus antigone and common crane Grus grus) due to chemical poisoning (Vijayan, 1991, Muralidharan, 1993, Pain et al., 2004). The intensive use of agrochemicals has always been a serious threat to the KNP (Bhadouria et al. 2012). Most of the birds go out of the KNP to feed in the agricultural fields or satellite wetlands (Bhupathy, 1991; Sundaramoorthy 1991). The birds feeding outside possibly ingest a considerable quantity of these toxic agrochemicals.|$|E

40|$|Ethyne was {{probably}} first {{made in the}} laboratory by Edmund Davy in 1836. It was rediscovered {{nearly a quarter of}} a century later by Berthelot who gave it the name acetylene. Since that time ethyne has become a cheap raw material for the synthesis of organic materials and an important industrial fuel. A summary of the available solubility data for ethyne was published by Miller in 1965 [S. A Miller, Acetylene—Its Properties, <b>Manufacture,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Uses</b> (Academic, New York, 1965), Vol. I]. Many more data are now available in a wide range of research papers and patent applications. These data vary in their reliability. In the current work the data for systems included in Miller’s book have been reassessed and complemented by data published more recently. Literature has been surveyed to 1999. Data for a system may be unreliable unless two or more groups of workers have published values in close agreement. Where possible values of the mole fraction solubility at a partial pressure of 101. 3 kPa have been tabulated. Equations have been given for the variation of mole fraction with temperature in cases in which values over a temperature range are available. The greater the number of independent sources of the data the more the reliance which can be placed on the utility of the resulting equation. Extrapolation of such equations beyond the temperature range of experimental measurements can lead to errors. In many of the systems it may be assumed that approximate values of the mole fraction solubility,x 1, at a partial pressure of 101. 3 kPa may be obtained by linear extrapolation of values for lower partial pressures,p 1, on the assumption that x 1 /p 1 is approximately constant. However a similar linear extrapolation of solubilities at pressures appreciably higher that 101. 3 kPa to give mole fraction solubilities at 101. 3 kPa can lead to gross errors. For the purpose of evaluation of data use has been made of the Krichevsky–Il’inskaya equation to obtain approximate values of solubilities at 101. 3 kPa from measurements at higher pressures. These values were then compared with measurements made at or near to 101. 3 kPa...|$|E
