5|$|Hygrophoropsis was {{originally}} circumscribed in 1888 by German mycologist Joseph Schröter as a subgenus of Cantharellus. It contained a single species, the widespread H.aurantiaca, {{commonly known as}} the false chanterelle. German naturalist Bernhard Studer-Steinhäuslin concluded in 1900 that the fungus was <b>more</b> <b>appropriately</b> placed in the genus Clitocybe, based on its white spores, decurrent gills, and lack of a ring on the stipe. This classification was adopted in the early writings of influential mycologist Rolf Singer, who in 1943 proposed that Hygrophoropsis should be a subgenus of Clitocybe.|$|E

25|$|Geologically, {{this region}} is perhaps <b>more</b> <b>appropriately</b> called the Arabian subcontinent because it lies on a tectonic plate of its own, the Arabian Plate, {{which has been}} moving {{incrementally}} away {{from the rest of}} Africa (forming the Red Sea) and north, toward Asia, into the Eurasian plate (forming the Zagros mountains). The rocks exposed vary systematically across Arabia, with the oldest rocks exposed in the Arabian-Nubian Shield near the Red Sea, overlain by earlier sediments that become younger towards the Persian Gulf. Perhaps the best-preserved ophiolite on Earth, the Semail Ophiolite, lies exposed in the mountains of the UAE and northern Oman.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{method of}} obtaining new deoxyribozymes is through in vitro {{evolution}}. Though this term is often used interchangeably with in vitro selection, in vitro evolution <b>more</b> <b>appropriately</b> refers to a slightly different procedure in which the initial oligonucleotide pool is genetically altered over subsequent rounds through genetic recombination or through point mutations. For point mutations, the pool can be amplified using error-prone PCR to produce many different strands of various random, single mutations. As with in vitro selection, the evolved strands with increased activity will tend to dominate the pool after multiple selection steps, and once a sufficient catalytic activity is reached, the pool can be sequenced to identify the most active strands.|$|E
25|$|During the lead-up to the 1999–2000 season, the {{selectors}} made {{it clear}} that they wanted Adam Gilchrist to keep for the Test team as well as the ODI side. Initially, Healy requested that he be allowed to play one more season and then retire, which was refused. He then asked to play the first Test, scheduled for his home ground at Brisbane, as a farewell. This, too, was refused, so he announced his immediate retirement from all forms of the game in a statement released on 28 October 1999. In response to the tremendous public farewells afforded to Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Justin Langer at the end of the fifth Test at Sydney in 2006–07, Healy called for long-standing players to have their farewells to the game managed <b>more</b> <b>appropriately</b> than his own.|$|E

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{metacognitive strategies}} used by Institut Teknologi 10 November (lTS) students in reading comprehension. The study also reports {{the types of}} metacognitive strategies more frequently used by these students according to self-reported proficiency in English (i. e the students' average scores in English course). The following questions are addressed: 1) What types of metacognitive strategies are used by ITS students? 2) Which types of metacognitive strategies are <b>more</b> frequently and <b>appropriately</b> used by ITS students? This is a descriptive research searching the metacognitive strategies {{and the types of}} metacognitve strategies used <b>more</b> frequently and <b>appropriately</b> by ITS students on reading comprehension. The primary instrument of this study is the researcher. He used questionnaires and interviewed students to collect data. The writer had to choose the 'opportunistic sample', due to the limitation of time and unfavorable situation and condition when the data collection was held. Forty five students in the sixth semester were chosen as the subjects of the study. The types of metacognitive strategies used are: preparing and planning for learning (in this context it is for reading), selecting and using learning strategy use, monitoring strategy use, orchestrating various strategies, and evaluating strategy use and learning. The types of metacognitve strategies which are used more frequently are: selecting and using learning strategy and evaluating strategy and learning. The successful students use many types of metacognitive strategies and they use them <b>more</b> frequently and <b>appropriately</b> than less successful students. From the results of the data analysis, it seems that the metacognitive strategies and the type of metacognitive strategies are <b>more</b> frequently and <b>appropriately</b> used and they {{play an important role in}} reading comprehension. In essence, successful students appear to use more metacognitive strategies and use them more frequently than less successful students. The successful students also have better reading comprehension once they have passed a threshold of English language ability. Based on these findings, the researcher recommends that the reading instruction should include metacognitive strategies and metacognitive knowledge or knowledge awareness...|$|R

25|$|Backpacks {{in general}} fall {{into one of}} four categories: frameless, {{external}} frame, internal frame, and bodypack. A pack frame, when present, serves to support the pack and distribute the weight of its contents across the body <b>more</b> <b>appropriately,</b> by transferring much of the weight to the hips and legs. Most of the weight is therefore taken off the shoulders, reducing the chance of injury from shoulder strap pressure (many backpacks equipped solely with shoulder straps can affect the posture of a person carrying more than 14kg (30lbs)), as well as being less restrictive of the upper body range of motion. Most backpacks are capable of being closed with either a buckle mechanism, a zipper, or a dry-bag type closure though a few models use a drawstring fitted with a cord lock for the main compartment.|$|E
25|$|Ornithologists have {{traditionally}} recognized two subspecies of this bird: the American ivory-billed, the more famous of the two, and the Cuban ivory-billed woodpecker. The two look similar despite differences {{in size and}} plumage. Some controversy exists over whether the Cuban ivory-billed woodpecker is <b>more</b> <b>appropriately</b> recognized as a separate species. A recent study compared DNA samples taken from specimens of both ivory-billed birds along with the imperial woodpecker, a larger but otherwise very similar bird. It concluded {{not only that the}} Cuban and American ivory-billed woodpeckers are genetically distinct, but also that they and the imperial form a North American clade within Campephilus that appeared in the mid-Pleistocene. The study does not attempt to define a lineage linking the three birds, though it does imply that the Cuban bird is more closely related to the imperial.|$|E
25|$|The Tibetan Buddhism {{tradition}} emphasizes an instructive and devotional {{relationship to}} a guru; this may involve devotional practices known as guru yoga which are congruent with prayer. It also appears that Tibetan Buddhism posits {{the existence of}} various deities, but the peak view of the tradition is that the deities or yidam are no more existent or real than the continuity (Sanskrit: santana; refer mindstream) of the practitioner, environment and activity. But how practitioners engage yidam or tutelary deities will depend upon the level or <b>more</b> <b>appropriately</b> yana at which they are practicing. At one level, one may pray to a deity for protection or assistance, taking a more subordinate role. At another level, one may invoke the deity, on a more equal footing. And {{at a higher level}} one may deliberately cultivate the idea that one has become the deity, whilst remaining aware that its ultimate nature is śūnyatā.

25|$|Staging is {{generally}} by the UICC/AJCC TNM (Tumour, Nodes, Metastases) system. HPV+OPC {{has been treated}} similarly to stage-matched and site-matched HPV unrelated OPC, but its unique features, which contrast smoking-related HPV-OPC head and neck cancers, for which patients' demographics, comorbidities, risk factors, and carcinogenesis differ markedly, suggest that a distinct staging system be developed to <b>more</b> <b>appropriately</b> represent {{the severity of the}} disease and its prognosis. Standard AJCC TNM staging, such as the seventh edition (2009) while predictive for HPV-OPC has no prognostic value in HPV+OPC. The 8th edition of the AJCC TNM Staging Manual (2016) incorporates this specific staging for HPV+OPC. Current treatment guidelines do not account for the different outcomes observed in HPV+OPC. Consequently, less intensive (de-intensification) use of radiotherapy or chemotherapy, as well as specific therapy, is under investigation, enrolling HPV+OPC in clinical trials to preserve disease control and minimise morbidity in selected groups based on modified TNM staging and smoking status.|$|E

25|$|International NGOs (INGOs) {{have found}} {{operating}} in Iraq highly dangerous to their staff, as between March 2003 and March 2008 94 aid workers were killed, 248 injured, 24 arrested or detained and 89 kidnapped or abducted. This {{has led to}} INGOs to either completely unwind their operations, or else go undercover {{and try to make}} their activities as low profile as possible. INGOs are not treated as neutral parties by large sections of the population due to their beginning operations alongside the invasion and receiving security and funding from the multinational force and the governments that it consists of. The security situation has also led to much of the management of aid programmes to take place abroad, thus lowering the effectiveness of the programmes and creating a fragmented response.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{influence}} self-referral, it {{is crucial}} to know a patient's motives to directly visit the emergency department (ED). The goal {{of this study is to}} examine motives for self-referral to the ED and compare these motives in relation to appropriateness. METHODS: All self-referred patients visiting the ED of a Dutch hospital over four separate months in a 1 -year period were included. Patients were handed questionnaires that included questions on their reasons to visit the ED directly and where they would seek medical help next time. Additionally, the motives of patients that either appropriately or inappropriately visited the ED were compared. In a previous study on the same patient cohort, the appropriateness of the ED visits was determined using predefined criteria. RESULTS: A total of 3196 self-referred patients were included, and 48. 9 % completed the questionnaires. The majority of patients (28. 0 %) attended the ED without a referral because they thought they would get help faster; the next reason was the easier access to radiologic and laboratory investigations (answered by 23. 8 %); and the third was the symptoms were considered too severe to visit a general practitioner (GP) (answered by 22. 7 %). The majority (78. 5 %) would attend the ED the next time they are faced with similar symptoms. Appropriate visits were significantly more seen in females, elderly, and patients in higher triage categories. Patients who expect investigations are necessary, think their symptoms are too severe to visit a GP, or would return to the ED next time were <b>more</b> often <b>appropriately</b> visiting the ED. CONCLUSIONS: The choice of patients to self-refer to an ED is often an explicate decision. Patients are looking for specialist help and want fast and easy access to radiologic and laboratory investigations. Even though the primary care network is well developed in the Netherlands, the reasons for self-referral are similar to the reasons found in previous literature based in other countries. Patients who visit the ED because of health concerns visit the ED <b>more</b> often <b>appropriately</b> than patients visiting for practical reasons...|$|R

25|$|The High Court {{exercises}} both original jurisdiction and {{appellate jurisdiction}} in {{civil and criminal}} matters. By possessing original jurisdiction, the Court is able to hear cases at first instance; in other words, it can deal with trials of matters coming before the courts for the first time. In theory, the Court has unlimited original jurisdiction – it can hear any type of civil or criminal case, no matter how trivial or serious. However, in practice, parties may be penalized by having to pay higher costs (legal fees) {{if they choose to}} bring a civil case before the High Court when it is <b>more</b> <b>appropriately</b> dealt with by a subordinate court. For example, a Magistrate's Court may hear civil cases where the amount claimed does not exceed S$60,000. If a plaintiff commences an action in the High Court to recover a sum of money based on contract, tort or any written law, and the suit could have been filed in a Magistrate's Court, if the plaintiff eventually succeeds in recovering a sum that does not exceed $60,000, she is not entitled to receive any more costs – legal expenses payable to her by the defendant – than a Magistrate's Court would have ordered. Generally, except in probate matters, a civil case must be commenced in the High Court if the value of the claim exceeds S$250,000. Probate matters are commenced in the High Court only if the value of the deceased's estate exceeds $3 million, or if the case involves the resealing of a foreign grant of probate or letters of administration.|$|E
