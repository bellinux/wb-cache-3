5|$|Martin {{believes}} {{the last two}} volumes of the series will be big books of 1500 manuscript pages each. The sixth book will be called The Winds of Winter, taking {{the title of the}} last book of the originally planned trilogy. Displeased with the provisional title A Time for Wolves for the final volume, Martin ultimately announced A Dream of Spring as the title for the seventh book in 2006. <b>Martin</b> <b>said</b> in March 2012 that the final two novels will take readers farther north than any of the previous books, and that the Others will appear in the book.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} {{speculation}} about possible successor shows, in May 2017 HBO commissioned five screenwriters – Max Borenstein, Jane Goldman, Brian Helgeland, Carly Wray and a fifth writer {{yet to be}} announced – to develop individual Game of Thrones successor series. All of the writers are to be working individually with George R. R. Martin. <b>Martin</b> <b>said</b> that all the concepts under discussion are prequels, and some may be set outside Westeros. He also ruled out Robert's Rebellion (the overthrow of Daenerys's father by Robert Baratheon) as a possible idea. D. B. Weiss and David Benioff {{said that they would}} not be involved with any of the projects, and want to enjoy the successor series as fans. Martin is co-writing two of the four announced scripts. In September 2017, it was announced that Game of Thrones writer Bryan Cogman would be developing a fifth prequel series.|$|E
5|$|Regarding A Song of Ice and Fire as his magnum opus, Martin {{is certain}} never to write {{anything}} {{on this scale}} again and would only return to this fictional universe {{in the context of}} stand-alone novels. He prefers to write stories about characters from other Ice and Fire periods of history such as his Tales of Dunk and Egg project, instead of continuing the series directly. A possible future side project is a prequel set during Aegon's conquest of Westeros. <b>Martin</b> <b>said</b> he would love to return to writing short stories, novellas, novelettes, and stand-alone novels from diverse genres such as science fiction, horror, fantasy, or even a murder mystery. However, he will see if his audience follows him after publishing his next project.|$|E

5|$|After he was rammed by his {{teammate}} Brian Vickers in the UAW-Ford 500, Johnson said the expectations {{for him to}} succeed at Lowe's Motor Speedway were high and hoped the track's surface would be more predictable. <b>Martin</b> <b>said</b> {{he was in the}} best position that he had been in for several years to win the championship, and spoke of his waning interest in looking at race results. Having secured one top-ten finish in the season's first four Chase for the Nextel Cup races, Earnhardt stated he need to secure a top-five finishing position, and was determined to get his team more involved in the championship battle. Gordon had driven well at the circuit, but without finishing. His team brought the car he drove to victory in the season's 18th race at Chicagoland Speedway. Gordon felt it would help him at intermediate tracks and get him back into championship contention. Although he had a poor start in the chase, Kahne rectified this by finishing second at Talladega Superspeedway. He believed the momentum would be carried into Charlotte and stated he would push hard to win races.|$|E
5|$|Setting out {{to write}} {{something}} on an epic scale, Martin projected to write three books of 800 manuscript pages {{in the very early}} stages of the series. His original 1990s contract specified one-year deadlines for his previous literary works, but Martin only realized later that his new books were longer and hence required more writing time. In 2000, Martin planned to take 18 months to two years for each volume and projected the last of the planned six books to be released five or six years later. However, with the Ice and Fire series evolving into the biggest and most ambitious story he has ever attempted writing, he still has two more books to write as of 2016. <b>Martin</b> <b>said</b> he needed to be in his own office in Santa Fe, New Mexico to immerse himself in the fictional world and write. As of 2011, Martin was still typing his fiction on a DOS computer with WordStar 4.0 software. He begins each day at 10am with rewriting and polishing the previous day's work, and may write all day or struggle to write anything. Excised material and previous old versions are saved to be possibly re-inserted at a later time.|$|E

25|$|The first {{squadron}} of 20 F-35 jets {{from the first}} production series would only include a few Israeli-made systems. The United States, meanwhile, has agreed that if Israel buys more F-35 squadrons from later production series, the installation of more Israeli-made systems will be allowed. To sweeten the deal, Lockheed <b>Martin</b> <b>said</b> it would buy parts and systems for the F-35 from Israeli companies {{at a cost of}} $4 billion. The aircraft will be designated F-35I, as there will be unique Israeli features installed in them.|$|E
25|$|The Atlantic {{noted that}} Daenerys and Queen Cersei share the {{parallels}} of being forced into marriage, having powerful strengths of will, and being utterly ruthless toward their enemies. As bloodline and succession are the quickest and {{surest way to}} assert strength in Westeros, Cersei takes advantage of motherhood by procreating with her brother Jaime and having children fathered by her hated husband Robert aborted, thereby leaving him without a true heir in revenge. <b>Martin</b> <b>said</b> that Cersei's walk of public penitence in A Dance with Dragons may be read as misogynistic or feminist. Jane Shore, mistress of King Edward IV, was punished similarly after Edward's death. Cersei is defined by her pride, and this punishment was directed at women to break their pride, but was never inflicted on men.|$|E

However, after guitarist Jonny Buckland played the song on his guitar, <b>Martin</b> <b>said</b> that they now needed to record it and include it on the album. Martin also said that: [...] "That's about where you're put in the world, and how you're given your position, {{and the way you}} look, and how you have to get on with it." [...] In {{an interview}}, Buckland revealed that the song was hard to record, as the band had played the song live.
