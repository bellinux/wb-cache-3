40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree: Doctor of Technology: DESIGN In the Faculty of Informatics and Design At the Cape Peninsula University of TechnologyCurrently, the South African leather tanning industry is dominated by chromium tanning which {{has been identified as}} highly polluting. <b>Vegetable</b> <b>tanning</b> is considered less environmentally hazardous. Yet, there have been no plans to promote it in South Africa. <b>Vegetable</b> <b>tanning</b> process utilises <b>vegetable</b> matter for converting animal skins or hides into pliable material that is known as leather. South Africa has a variety of plants that produce tannins. However, the focus of this study is on the mimosa locally known as black wattle (Arcacia miernsii). Furthermore, the South African <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanning</b> sector has been left behind in terms of research and development despite the country being endowed with the Mimosa plant that is widely used in the <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanning</b> process. The country is also endowed with surplus labour which can be absorbed by the leather industry which is labour intensive...|$|R
40|$|The {{processing}} of heavy leather employs the <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanning</b> method involving use of tan liquor. The solid residue of this <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanning</b> process aggravates the water pollution {{by means of}} leaching of tannin and other associatedpollutants. Tannin is a biologically resistant compound causing several problems in animal body. The present study dealt with the pollution hazard arising out of leaching of pollutants from the open dumped <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanning</b> residue by rainfall washing. The concerned pollutants were pH, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), tannin,sulfate and chloride concentration. To explore the possible extent of contamination of these pollutants in the leached water, two different masses (2 kg and 3 kg) of tanning residue were employed. The {{results of the study}} showed that there was a continuous release of pollutants from the <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanning</b> residue. Moreover, there was no regular variation in various pollutant concentrations in both the cases solely due to non-homogeneity of the residue...|$|R

40|$|Gambier is {{obtained}} from the extraction of leaves and young twigs of Uncaria gambir, a shrub that grows in Indonesia. Gambier contains tannin by 20 % to 55 % so {{that can be used}} as a <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanning</b> material using the C-RFP system (C=Conditioning, R=Rapid, F=Fass (drum), P=Powder). This research aimed to determine the effectiveness of gambier as a <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanning</b> material using the C-RFP system. Pickled leather underwent a tanning process using the C-RFP system with gambier as the tanning material at various percentages, namely by 15 %, 20 %, and 25 %, to be processed as leather for jackets. The variations of oil used to keep the leather supple were 12. 5 %, 15 %, and 17. 5 %. The tanned leather was then tested in terms of its organoleptic, physical, chemical, and morphological properties. Results of the organoleptic test and most of the results of the physical test showed that leather for jackets which was <b>tanned</b> using a <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanning</b> material met the requirements set out by SNI 4593 : 2011 (sheepskin/goatskin leather for jackets). Results of the SEM test indicated that leather for jackets which was <b>tanned</b> using a <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanning</b> material displayed dense and strong skin tissue, and this proves that gambier is very effective for <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanning</b> using the C-RFP system...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} it is {{presented}} the characterisation of tannins used in the <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanning</b> of two types of European historic and decorative leathers from Portuguese collections, damask leathers and gilt leathers, dated from the 17 th and 18 th centuries. Extracts prepared from collected leather fibres were analysed by attenuated total reflectance &#x 2013; Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. Results were compared with data collected from different reference <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanning</b> materials which, according to historic and technical literature, were used in Europe during the Modern Age. This study allowed, in most cases, the characterisation of the tannins used to produce the studied decorative <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanned</b> leathers and, at the same time, the detection of chemical deterioration of leathers, particularly collagen hydrolysis, which was not visually perceived...|$|R

40|$|Background: foot eczema {{is caused}} by shoe contact allergy in 3 - 11 % of the cases. The most common sensitizers are {{represented}} by rubber, adhesives, chemical tans, dyes, several biocides and, the last but not the least, metal accessories. <b>Vegetable</b> <b>tans</b> would be less important than chromium salts in the etiology of footwear allergic contact dermatitis. However, {{few studies have been}} made on their sensitization potential. Objectives: the two goals for this study were to determine a) the optimal patch testing concentration for the four most widely used and rich of tannins <b>vegetable</b> <b>tans</b> (chestnut, mimosa, quebracho and tara) and b) the prevalence of irritant and allergic reactions to the four <b>vegetable</b> <b>tans</b> and two vegetable-tanned skins (sole leather, vacchetta). Materials and Methods: in phase 1 find the optimal patch testing concentration of the four <b>vegetable</b> <b>tans</b> diluted in petrolatum; this was evaluated by a serial dilution test (5, 2 and 1 %) in 100 subjects with various skin diseases. In phase 2, sensitization and irritation potential of the four <b>vegetable</b> <b>tans</b> in petrolatum 2 % and the two vegetable-tanned skins were investigated in 563 patients patch tested for eczematous dermatitis or any suspected allergic skin disorder. Results and discussion: the study demonstrates that optimal concentration to test <b>vegetable</b> <b>tans</b> in petrolatum is 2 % and that delayed positive reactions to tans are very rare (0. 4 %) and not clinically relevant, while those to vegetable-tanned skins (1. 2 %) are more frequent but probably relevant only in 3 of the 7 patients. These last three cases were not associated to positive patch tests to single tan; therefore, they could be due to preservatives, chemical contaminants or reaction compounds introduced accidentally during the production cycle...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to aquire an appropriate plating technique on leather product accessories made from metal without lessening the wonderful appearance of the accessories, to maintain the shade and to keep the rust away from the accessories that avoid or diminish defects on the leather. The plating was carried out by spraying using spraying-gun one, two, and three times, and repeated three times for each treatment to chrome plated metal, gold plated metal and roasted metal. The smaples were then pinned on a piece of chrome <b>tanning</b> leather and <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanned</b> leather, whereas the test carried out was wet and dry rub fastness. Data from completely randomized design are analyzed by factorial pattern according to Gasperz (1991), showed that there was not significant effect on plating neither metal on chrome and <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanned</b> leather having been stored for one, two, or three months, neither on similar things having not been stored yet. However there was significant difference on accessories having been do treated as the stated above and set on a piece of <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanned</b> leather stored for three months. Conclusion could be drawn from {{the research}} that the use of acrylate using spray system for plating metal accessories was able to maintain its beautiful appearance, kept the rust away, that was not create defects neither on chrome nor <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanned</b> leather...|$|R

In the beamhouse, low levels of lime are shown to be adequate and this reduces the sludge problem; other components of lime liquors, such as protein and sulfides, are easily eliminated in aerobic digesters. <b>Vegetable</b> <b>tanning</b> procedures based on the renowned Liritan system are described; these show that vegetable tannin in effluent can be kept at a very low level. -x-x...|$|R
40|$|As a tanning {{material}} alum salt has similar {{properties of the}} basic chromium sulphate. It is, therefore, {{the purpose of this}} research is to exchange chromium tannage with alum tannage in pretanning for the <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanned</b> lining leather. In doing such a way the chromium pollution may be eliminated, whereas the alum pretanned lining leather output must be fulfill the physical and chemical requirements as that one of the chrome pretanned. In pretanning the use of alum tannage varied from 2, 5 %, 3, 0 %, 3, 5 % and 4, 0 %. Afterwards the subsequent process was <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanning</b> using 30 % of mimosa powder. The lining leather output from the research was physical and chemical tested. The practical meaning of this research is that for pretanning the <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanned</b> lining leather it is possible to use 2, 5 % alum salt. The values of the physical and chemical test obtained are that the degree of tannage is 94, 54, tensile strength is 174, 24 kg/cm 2, and strength is 22 %.

40|$|The term of {{eco-friendly}} leather can {{be interpreted}} as chrome-free tanned leather. Recently, almost 80 % of leather is tanned using chrome tanning agent because of the ease in processing and excellence of the physical properties. Nevertheless, people nowadays want an eco-friendly leather product. <b>Vegetable</b> <b>tanning</b> materials can be said as eco-friendly tanning material because their waste degrades easily. One of the weaknesses in the use of <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanning</b> is a high water absorption capability. In this research used a water repellent material that has the properties to suppress the ability of water absorption. The purpose of the research was to determine the effect of water repellent on physical properties and morphology of leather <b>tanned</b> by <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanning</b> materials. Because one of the weaknesses in the <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanning</b> is its high water absorption capability, in this research, water repellent was used and varied by 5; 7. 5; 10; 12. 5; and 15 %. Physical properties obtained were compared with analysis of variance with the significance level of 95 %. The water repellent increased from 5 % to 15 %. The results showed a decrease in water absorption capability from 77. 6 % to 65. 39 %, tearing strength from 41. 64 to 20. 05 kg/cm, tensile strength from 227. 10 to 163. 53 kg/cm 2, and elongation at break from 57. 11 to 49. 68 %, strong swelling and WVA have no significant changes, while for WVP, the maximum use of water repellent at 12. 5 %.
