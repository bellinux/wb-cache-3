5|$|Polyaenus recounts that Philip {{attacked}} and sacked {{the cities of}} Abdera and Maroneia {{along the coast of}} Thrace. This occurred during a single campaign, but does not say when. Diodorus does not <b>mention</b> <b>this</b> campaign, making its position within the overall chronology difficult to place.|$|E
5|$|Allegations {{have been}} made of {{omissions}} in the history described by the film. The absence of discussion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was noticed by some viewers. Davis claimed that Leo Strauss's ideas had been formed by his experiences in Germany during the Weimar Republic, and alleged that the film's failure to <b>mention</b> <b>this</b> was motivated by a wish to portray Strauss as concerned with American suburban culture, like Qutb.|$|E
5|$|The Manikarnika Ghat is the Mahasmasana, {{the primary}} site for Hindu {{cremation}} in the city. Adjoining the ghat, there are raised platforms {{that are used}} for death anniversary rituals. According to a myth {{it is said that}} an earring of Shiva or his wife Sati fell here. Fourth-century Gupta period inscriptions <b>mention</b> <b>this</b> ghat. However, the current ghat as a permanent riverside embankment was built in 1302 and has been renovated at least three times throughout its existence.|$|E

5|$|Andrew {{discharged}} Palatine Theodore Csanád {{and restored}} Julius Kán {{in the second}} half of 1222. The following year, Pope Honorius urged Andrew to launch a new crusade. If the report of the Continuatio Claustroneuburgensis is reliable, Andrew took the cross to show that he intended launch a new crusade, but no other sources <b>mention</b> <b>this</b> event. Andrew planned to arrange a new marriage for his eldest son, Béla, but Pope Honorius mediated a reconciliation between Béla and his wife in the autumn of 1223. This angered Andrew, and Béla fled to Austria. He returned in 1224, after the bishops persuaded Andrew to forgive him.|$|E
5|$|Diodorus {{says that}} the Egyptian fleet was sent to {{circumnavigate}} Salamis, and block the northern exit from the Straits. If Xerxes wanted to trap the Allies completely, this maneuver would have made sense (especially {{if he was not}} expecting the Allies to fight). However, Herodotus does not <b>mention</b> <b>this</b> (and possibly alludes to the Egyptian presence in the main battle), leading some modern historians to dismiss it; though again, others accept it as a possibility. Xerxes had also positioned around 400 troops on the island known as Psyttaleia, {{in the middle of the}} exit from the straits, in order to kill or capture any Greeks who ended up there (as a result of shipwreck or grounding).|$|E
5|$|I {{think it}} is {{important}} that people see that spirituality is at the base of Nonviolent Communication, and that they learn the mechanics of the process with that in mind. It's really a spiritual practice that I am trying to show as a way of life. Even though we don't <b>mention</b> <b>this,</b> people get seduced by the practice. Even if they practice this as a mechanical technique, they start to experience things between themselves and other people they weren't able to experience before. So eventually they come to the spirituality of the process. They begin to see that it's more than a communication process and realize it's really an attempt to manifest a certain spirituality.|$|E

5|$|T-26 model 1931 with gun plus {{machine gun}} armament: twin-turreted version with a 37mm {{gun in the}} right turret (some modern sources <b>mention</b> <b>this</b> tank as T-26 model 1932). There were two models of 37mm guns in the USSR {{suitable}} for mounting in light tanks at that time—the Hotchkiss gun (or its Soviet improved variant PS-1), and the more powerful PS-2 gun developed by P. Syachentov. The latter was superior, but only experimental models existed. Therefore, the first 10 pre-production T-26s, which had a design identical to the Vickers 6-Ton, were equipped with a Hotchkiss gun in the right turret to increase firepower compared to the machine gun armed Vickers tank. The experimental PS-2 gun was mounted on only three T-26 tanks, the right turrets of which were replaced with small gun turrets from the T-35-1 (prototype of the T-35 heavy tank).|$|E
5|$|The Excellency {{over the}} Masses (also {{known as the}} Minister over the Masses) shared the same censorial and {{advisory}} roles as the other two Excellencies, the Excellency of Works and Grand Commandant. Like his previous counterpart, the Chancellor, {{he must have been}} responsible for drawing up the annual budget, although contemporary sources fail to <b>mention</b> <b>this</b> point. Aside from the court conference, the Great Conference of leading officials across the empire was conducted by his ministry. The Chancellor's bureaus were also retained by the Excellency over the Masses, and were nearly identical to that of the new Eastern-Han Grand Commandant's bureaus. He was given formal powers to supervise three of the Nine Ministers: the Minister Coachman, Minister of Justice, and Minister Herald.|$|E

25|$|In earlier {{versions}} of C++ {{there was no such}} thing as placement new; instead, developers used explicit assignment to this within constructors to achieve similar effect. This practice has been deprecated and abolished later, and third edition of The C++ Programming Language doesn't <b>mention</b> <b>this</b> technique.|$|E
25|$|Some Russian sources {{attribute}} {{the creation of}} this dish (or of its precursor) to Nicolas Appert, French confectioner and chef, {{best known as the}} inventor of airtight food preservation.

During the 2002 Winter Olympics, TV host Jay Leno joked that the Korean skater Kim Dong-Sung would eat his dog. The MCIC Group filed a class-action lawsuit against Leno {{on behalf of}} 50,000 Korean Americans, demanding an apology and monetary damages.|$|E

25|$|In the 7th and 8th centuries, the Frankish chronologies <b>mention</b> <b>this</b> area as {{the kingdom}} of the Frisians. This kingdom {{comprised}} the coastal provinces of the Netherlands and the German North Sea coast. During this time, the Frisian language was spoken along the entire southern North Sea coast. The 7th-century Frisian Kingdom (650–734) under King Aldegisel and King Redbad, had its centre of power in Utrecht.|$|E

Examples include Oddjob, the secondary villain of the James Bond novel Goldfinger by Ian Fleming (the film adaptation does not <b>mention</b> <b>this</b> but leaves it implied); the fanciful portrayal of Roman Emperor Commodus in the 2000 film Gladiator,; and serial killer Francis Dolarhyde in the film Red Dragon.|$|E

25|$|It {{has also}} been {{proposed}} that Nachmanides' intent was that even the commandment that a Jew should live in the land as an individual during exile applies only when living in the land is consistent with exile, that is, when a non-Jewish government rules the land. But living under a Jewish government such as the State of Israel might itself constitute {{a violation of the}} oath. Nachmanides felt no need to <b>mention</b> <b>this</b> exception to the commandment because he did not foresee the rise of a Jewish government in the Holy Land before the messiah.|$|E
25|$|Sergius’ {{ties with}} the family of Theophylact were made even closer, at least {{according}} to rumour, by Sergius’ supposed affair with Theophylact’s daughter, Marozia. This relationship was promoted by Marozia’s mother, Theodora, and the result of this affair was a male child who in time became Pope John XI (931–935). The only source of this affair is the chronicler Liutprand of Cremona, writing some 50 years after the events of Sergius’ pontificate. Neither Auxilius of Naples nor Eugenius Vulgarius, both of whom were exact contemporaries of Sergius, and both of whom were hostile towards Sergius for his attacks on Formosus, <b>mention</b> <b>this</b> allegation at all.|$|E
25|$|Broad Peak was {{the third}} eight-thousander scaled by Messner in 1982. At the time, {{he was the only}} person with a permit to climb this mountain, but he came across Jerzy Kukuczka and Wojciech Kurtyka, who had permits to climb K2, but used its {{geographic}} proximity to climb Broad Peak illegally. In early descriptions of the ascent, Messner omitted to <b>mention</b> <b>this</b> encounter, but he referred to it several years later. On 2 August, Messner was reunited with Nazir Sabir and Khan again on the summit. The three mountaineers had decamped and made for Broad Peak immediately after their ascent of Gasherbrum II. The climb was carried out with a variation from the normal route at the start.|$|E
