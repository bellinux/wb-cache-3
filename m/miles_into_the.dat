5|$|After {{crossing}} from East Lenox, PA106 continues southeastward through {{fields and}} soon into {{a region of}} residences. The southeastern stretch continues for several <b>miles</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> community of West Clifford. There, PA106 passes some homes and intersects with PA374. The two designations become concurrent, paralleling the alignment of the Milford and Owego Turnpike Road through West Clifford. PA106 and PA374 head southward and soon turn southwestward through forestry, until clearing into the community of Royal. In the small community, PA106 and PA374 fork, with PA374 heading southwestward to Glenwood and PA106 heading southeastward through Royal. PA106 continues further, entering deep woods once again after leaving Royal. At the intersection with Cemetery Road, the highway enters a large cemetery and into Clifford. There, the route crosses through a large residential and commercial community, intersecting with State Route2008 (SR2008). The route continues southeastward through the residential area before crossing the county line into Lackawanna County.|$|E
5|$|At {{the heart}} of the Combine's command {{structure}} in Half-Life 2 is the Citadel, an enormous structure of Combine construction, reaching approximately 2.6 kilometres (1.6 <b>miles)</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sky from ground level, and delving deep underground. Located within City 17, the Citadel serves as the primary headquarters of the Combine, housing both Combine Advisors and the office of the Earth administrator, Wallace Breen. Breen is frequently seen on large screens around the city from which he spreads propaganda. The Citadel projects an energy field that is able to prevent human reproduction, as well as a field that keeps dangerous alien wildlife out of the city. In addition, the Citadel contains a trans-dimensional teleporter which allows the Combine to travel between their native universe and Earth. The Citadel also contains construction facilities for various synthetic Combine combat machines.|$|E
5|$|Dacite eruptions in the Lassen area {{typically}} {{begin with}} steam explosions {{caused by the}} interaction of rising magma with ground water. When dacite magma charged with volcanic gases reaches the surface, it erupts explosively, usually as a vertical column of gas and ash that can rise several <b>miles</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere. Heavy fallback of hot ash and rock fragments from eruption columns may generate highly mobile pyroclastic flows that can rush several miles down a volcano's slopes and adjacent valleys. Fallout from the eruption column can blanket areas within a few miles (~8km) of the vent with {{a thick layer of}} pumice, and high-altitude winds may carry finer ash tens to hundreds of miles from the volcano, posing a hazard to flying aircraft, particularly those with jet engines.|$|E

5|$|Silver, he writes, {{does not}} occur in native form {{and has to be}} mined, usually {{occurring}} with lead ores. Spain produced the most silver in his time, many of the mines having been started by Hannibal. One of the largest had galleries running up to two <b>miles</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mountain, while men worked day and night draining the mine in shifts. Pliny is probably referring to the reverse overshot water-wheels operated by treadmill and found in Roman mines. Britain, he says, is very rich in lead, which is found on the surface at many places, and thus very easy to extract; production was so high that a law was passed attempting to restrict mining.|$|E
5|$|The Lancaster {{was denied}} as a {{large-scale}} or long-term replacement. The Chief of the Air Staff, Portal, argued {{it was the}} only aircraft capable of carrying an 8,000lb bomb to Berlin and could not be spared. As a result, the RAF official history does not include the Lancaster as a Coastal Command aircraft. With a range of 2,350 miles it could have been invaluable. The Boeing Fortress was given to the service only because the Air Ministry considered it unfit as a heavy bomber. It issued a directive on 27 January 1942 stating all Fortresses were to given over to Coastal Command for A/S operations. No. 59 Squadron RAF, No. 206 Squadron RAF and No. 220 Squadron RAF all used the Fortress as successful reconnaissance aircraft. However, the bulk of the force by early 1942 was still medium-range aircraft, which could now reach only 600 <b>miles</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic. U-boats were now operating at 700 miles plus.|$|E
25|$|East of {{the center}} are mostly lower-income areas with some middle-class neighborhoods such as Jardín Balbuena. Urban sprawl {{continues}} further east for many <b>miles</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> State of Mexico, including Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl, now increasingly middle-class, but once full of informal settlements. These kind of slums are now found on the eastern edges of the metropolitan area in the Chalco area.|$|E

25|$|The {{aircraft}} flew on a 150 {{degree course}} toward Benina Airfield. The craft radioed for a directional {{reading from the}} HF/DF station at Benina and received a reading of 330 degrees from Benina. The actions of the pilot in flying 440 <b>miles</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> desert, however, indicate the navigator probably took a reciprocal reading {{off the back of}} the radio directional loop antenna from a position beyond and south of Benina but 'on course'. The pilot flew into the desert, thinking he was still over the Mediterranean and on his way to Benina.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, {{with the}} assistance of further artillery, Stuka dive bomber strikes, the 218th was able to pierce the French defenses, together with 22st1 and 239th infantry divisions. By 19 June, the division had advanced a further 15 <b>miles</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Vosges Mountains. The French Army {{was in a state of}} collapse, as on the previous day, Guderian's Panzer forces had reached the Swiss border, effectively surrounding the French defenders in the Vosges and 3 days later the armistice was signed at Compiègne, marking the end of hostilities.|$|E
25|$|Concurrent ground {{operations}} – The KLA undertook operations in Kosovo itself {{and had some}} successes against Serb forces. The Yugoslav army abandoned a border post opposite Morinë near the Yugoslav army outpost at Kosare in the north west of the province. The Yugoslav army outpost at Kosare remained in Yugoslav hands throughout the war: this allowed for a supply line {{to be set up}} into the province and the subsequent taking of territory in the Junik area. The KLA also penetrated a few <b>miles</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> south-western Mount Pastrik area. But most of the province remained under Serb control.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1914 the Special Organization (Teşkilat-ı Mahsusa), {{assisted}} by government and army officials, conscripted Greek men of military age from Thrace and western Anatolia into Labour Battalions in which hundreds of thousands died. Sent hundreds of <b>miles</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Interior of Anatolia, these conscripts were employed in road-making, building, tunnel excavating and other field work but their numbers were heavily reduced through either privations and ill-treatment or by outright massacre by their Ottoman guards. The policy of persecution and ethnic cleansing was expanded to {{other regions of the}} Empire including Pontus, Cappadocia and Cilicia.|$|E
25|$|Jennings was conciliatory towards Harrison, and in 1821 Harrison was {{appointed}} {{as a member}} of the committee who platted Indianapolis for the new state capitol. Harrison was the only member of the commission who arrived on time to the location that was sixty <b>miles</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wilderness. The other commissioners were long delayed in reaching the site, and Harrison, being a practical man, decided he formed a majority of the present commissioners and voted to begin laying out the town without them. He choose Alexander Ralston, who had been an assistant to Pierre Charles L’Enfant, to survey the site.|$|E
25|$|The Dallas Stars are a {{professional}} ice hockey team based in Dallas, Texas. They {{are members of}} the Central Division of the Western Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The team was founded during the 1967 NHL expansion as the Minnesota North Stars, based in Bloomington, Minnesota. Before the beginning of the 1978–79 NHL season, the team merged with the Cleveland Barons after the league granted them permission due to each team's respective financial struggles. Ultimately, the franchise relocated to Dallas for the 1993–94 NHL season. The Stars played out of Reunion Arena from their relocation until 2001, when the team moved less than 1.5 <b>miles</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> American Airlines Center.|$|E

25|$|Later works, {{including}} Arthur Murphy's The Upholster, or What News? (1758) and William Hodson's The Adventures of a Night (1783), {{borrowed from}} the play and met with mixed results. The play was also transformed by Bernard <b>Miles</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> musical Lock up your Daughters (1959). The show was performed at the Mermaid Theatre on 28 May 1959 and lasted for 330 shows. It was shown in Boston, New Haven, and Toronto in 1960, Melbourne in 1961, again at the Mermaid Theatre in 1962, and later Pasadena and Fort Lauderdale in 1968 and at East Haddam and the West End in 1969. A film version was made in 1969, but the movie has little connection to the original play.|$|E
25|$|When {{the captain}} made the {{decision}} to evacuate the chief engineer, who was suffering from gastroenteritis, the chief steward and two members of the deck crew, MRCC Turku gave the evacuation mission to Finnish Border Guard Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma OH-HVF which was returning from previous mission and still had more than two hours of remaining flight time. MRCC Göteborg authorized the Finnish helicopter to enter Swedish airspace as the combination was six <b>miles</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Swedish territorial waters. The helicopter arrived and began lifting the crew members from the rear part of the cargo hold at around 16:50, a task that was very difficult due to pitching and rolling of the combination. The crew was brought to Mariehamn where they were supposed to spend the night and then return to the ship in the morning. They didn't learn until morning that the combination had sunk.|$|E
25|$|Broadcast 25 November 1993, {{the second}} {{programme}} examines what happens during spring on Antarctica. The sea ice extends {{for hundreds of}} miles around the continent, {{but there are a}} few subantarctic islands that escape it. Such places are highly valued, for as the sea never freezes, animals can always get ashore. Elephant seals are the first creatures to return to the beaches. They form large breeding colonies, where the males fight fierce battles to gain and retain permanent access to a great number of females and mate with them as soon as they are receptive again. Millions of macaroni penguins occupy huge territories on the islands to breed, as do thousands of albatrosses. The Antarctic peninsula is one of the few regions of the continent inhabited by animals, even in summer. Gentoo penguins build their nests on bare rock and humpback whales seek krill along the coast, while Adelie penguins nest even further south. Crabeater seals, one of the most numerous mammals on Earth, live and reproduce in the pack ice zone around Antarctica. Snow petrels fly many <b>miles</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> island to find rock on which to lay their eggs.|$|E
6000|$|The others nodded, and Captain Warfield said: [...] "I {{was in the}} Magpie that blow, and we went ashore, {{all hands}} and the cook, Magpie and all, {{a quarter of a}} <b>mile</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cocoanuts at the head of Taiohae Bay--and it a {{supposedly}} hurricane-proof harbour." ...|$|R
60|$|Queen circled {{and wandered}} through the foggy, {{dripping}} forest until he headed down into a canyon.

When he did do so, night overtook him.|$|R
60|$|About a <b>mile</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> forest {{they came}} to a place where several ways met, under a grove of lofty and contorted oaks.

500|$|Writer Brian Michael Bendis {{has stated}} that he favors {{incorporating}} <b>Miles</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Spider-Man feature films in some way, as did actor Andrew Garfield who played Spider-Man in The Amazing Spider-Man feature film series.

However, after Marvel brokered a deal with Sony, that resulted in the addition of Peter Parker to the films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), producer Kevin Feige stated in that while Miles Morales would not be appearing in the MCU for the foreseeable future, he was interested in opportunities to explore the character. In 2017 Feige confirmed that Miles Morales does exist in the MCU, and that [...] alludes to him. In that film, Aaron Davis says [...] "I got a nephew living out here" [...] to Peter Parker. who is revealed in a deleted post-credits scene to be named Miles.|$|E
