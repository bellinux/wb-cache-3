Both films would become quotable cultural phenomena. A general audience trend towards action films starring the likes of Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger was also considered to work against the commercial success of The Shawshank Redemption. Freeman blamed the title, saying it was unmemorable, while Robbins recalled fans asking: [...] "What was that Shinkshonk Reduction thing?". Several alternative titles had been posited before the release due to concerns that it was not a <b>marketable</b> <b>title.</b> The low box office was also blamed on a lack of female characters to broaden the audience demographic, and the general unpopularity of prison films.|$|E

50|$|In {{the absence}} of an {{agreement}} to the contrary, there is an implied undertaking in the contract that the vendor (person selling the property) has a <b>marketable</b> <b>title.</b> The contract typically provides that on failure of a vendor to deliver good and <b>marketable</b> <b>title,</b> the vendee (buyer) may rescind the contract and recover any deposit.|$|E

5000|$|In the USA the {{definition}} of [...] "muniment" [...] may differ in statutes state by state. For example, states often have {{their own version of}} a <b>Marketable</b> Record <b>Title</b> Act (MRTA) which will extinguish various interests, restrictions, or claims to a property within a certain time period unless renewed during that time period by muniments.|$|R
50|$|The Victor Kamkin Bookstore was {{a retail}} book shop with a main {{location}} in Rockville, Maryland {{and a smaller}} store in New York City in the United States. Established in 1953 by Victor Kamkin and his wife Elena Kamkina, the store maintained continuous operation throughout the Cold War era, specializing in material published in the Soviet Union. In 2002 flagging sales, increased competition, and escalating costs foreshadowed a forced end to the operation. With some two million unsold volumes remaining in inventory, the store became the object of widespread media coverage, and thousands of customers flooded the store. Some 60,000 volumes were additionally saved from incineration through the prompt action of Congressional Representative Connie Morella and Librarian of Congress James H. Billington. The reprieve proved to be short-lived, however, and although some more <b>marketable</b> <b>titles</b> {{made their way to}} the inventories of other retailers of Russian-language books, hundreds of thousands of volumes were ultimately destroyed at the time of the store's forced liquidation in 2006.|$|R
50|$|Sellers {{only have}} to tender good and <b>marketable</b> <b>title</b> on the date the {{conveyance}} is executed (date of closing). So a seller may contract to sell property it does not currently possess. Liability will be imposed on the seller for breach only if the seller does not have good and <b>marketable</b> <b>title</b> on the date of closing.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Marketable</b> <b>title</b> (real estate) is a {{title that}} {{a court of}} equity {{considers}} to be so free from defect that it will legally force its acceptance by a buyer. <b>Marketable</b> <b>title</b> does not assume that absolute absence of defect, but rather a title that a prudent, educated buyer in the reasonable course of business would accept. For real estate practitioners, the most complete reference to title issues {{is found in the}} preprinted wording contained within an agreement/contract. If you cannot produce a clear title of deed to the property then the prospective buyer should expect to lose in a specific performance action.|$|E
50|$|Because {{title to}} {{property}} that arises by operation of law is usually contingent upon proof of certain contingencies, and title records may not contain evidence of those contingencies, legal proceedings are sometimes required to turn title that arises by operation of law into <b>marketable</b> <b>title.</b>|$|E

50|$|Judicial Code § 269, {{as amended}} , appellate courts are to give {{judgment}} after {{an examination of}} the record without regard to technical errors, defects, or exceptions which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties, and Judicial Code § 274b, provides whether the review is sought by writ of error or appeal, the appellate court is given to render such judgment upon the record as law and justice shall require. It follows that the court should have considered the issue of law and fact upon which the decree of the district court depended whether there was a good and <b>marketable</b> <b>title.</b> The Supreme Court could have determined the issue of whether there was good and <b>marketable</b> <b>title</b> but did not because the case was not of sufficient public interest to justify that, the case was remanded to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.|$|E
50|$|It is the {{responsibility}} of the buyer of real property to ensure that he or she obtains a good and <b>marketable</b> <b>title</b> to the land—ie., that the seller is the owner, has the right to sell the property, and there is no factor which would impede a mortgage or re-sale. Some jurisdictions have legislated some protections for the buyer, besides the ability for the buyer to do searches relating to the property.|$|E
5000|$|The word garçonne {{is derived}} from the French word for [...] "boy" [...] (garçon) with the {{addition}} of a feminine suffix; its closest English translation is [...] "tomboy". After the publication of Margueritte's novel, the term came into popular use as a descriptor for flappers, women who wore masculine clothing, and lesbians. According to Marsha Meskimmon, the relaunch of Frauenliebe as Garçonne, [...] "the more modish title", provided the magazine with a more <b>marketable</b> <b>title</b> that functioned as [...] "a common currency as a lesbian type".|$|E
50|$|Liberty Oil Company, a {{corporation}} organized {{under the laws}} of Virginia contracted to purchase 160 acres, more or less, of oil lands in Butler County, Kansas, for $1,150,000 from the Atlas Petroleum Company of Oklahoma, C. M. Ball, Isadore Litman, P. G. Keith, and J. H. Keith, residents of Kansas. Pursuant to the contract Liberty Oil Company deposited $100,000 in escrow with the Condon National Bank pursuant to the contract. The escrow was pursuant the term of the contract requiring that the vendors furnish an abstract of title to the property showing a good and <b>marketable</b> <b>title</b> in them. Liberty Oil Co. has seven days to review the abstract of title and if it showed good and <b>marketable</b> <b>title</b> Liberty Oil Co. was to pay {{the remainder of the}} purchase price and receive the deeds and possession of the land. If the examination showed a good and <b>marketable</b> <b>title,</b> and the vendee should refuse to pay the money then due from it, the $100,000 was to be delivered to the vendors as liquidated damages. In the event that the examination should disclose that the title was not good and marketable, the Liberty Oil was to notify the vendors, and they were to have 30 days in which to perfect the title, and, should they neglect in that time to do so, the $100,000 on deposit was to be returned to the Liberty Oil. In either case the contract was to become null and void. Liberty Oil claims abstract showed that the title of the vendors was not good and marketable, in that in the chain of title the vendors claimed under the deed of an assignee for the benefit of creditors filed in a Colorado court, but never authorized or confirmed by a court of competent jurisdiction under the laws of Kansas, as required by the law of Kansas, that this defect was not remedied by the vendors within the time required. On July 11, 1918, the plaintiff duly notified Condon National Bank of this and demanded payment of the money deposited. The vendors also demanded the payment of the money deposited. The bank did not pay either.|$|E
50|$|It {{is often}} the case that people choose to contact a title company or {{attorney}} to conduct an exhaustive title search. The process of performing a title search involves accessing the official land records for the subject property. Each record is a document evidencing an event which occurred {{in the history of the}} property. A deed records an event of property transfer, a mortgage documents the collateral interest of a home loan, and a lien documents a claim against the property in favor of another, such as a creditor, vendor, or tradesman. The objective of the title search is to establish clear, <b>marketable</b> <b>title</b> by exposing any outstanding claims prior to transfer of title.|$|E
50|$|Liberty Oil {{appealed to}} the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals {{claiming}} the court incorrectly decided {{the issue of the}} vendors having good and <b>marketable</b> <b>title.</b> The record of appeal was prepared as either bill of exceptions for writ of error from an action at law or a transcript for an appeal from a suit in equity. The Court of Appeals held that the case was reviewed by writ of error and since the bill of exceptions showed no special findings of fact but only a general finding in a case at law tried without a jury, it lacked power to rule as to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the finding so sustained the verdict. Liberty Oil appealed by certiorari to the United States Supreme Court.|$|E
50|$|When Congress {{passed a}} law in 1958 to {{terminate}} her tribe’s reservation lands, under the Indian termination policy, tribal members agreed in exchange for private land ownership and improvements including sewers, running water, streets and fire hydrants. The government also promised to provide a special program of education and training designed to help the Indians to earn a livelihood. Hardwick and other tribal members {{were led to believe}} that termination was mandatory and they were unprepared for state and county taxation requirements of privately held lands. The government failed to provide plumbing for Hardwick's home and when she attempted to secure a loan to make repairs, she was unable to do so. No title company would issue a policy stating that she had <b>marketable</b> <b>title.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Legal {{title is}} actual {{ownership}} of the property as when the property has been bought, the seller paid in full and a deed or title is properly recorded. Equitable title separates from legal title upon {{the death of the}} legal title holder (owner). For example: When a person having legal title to property dies, heirs at law or beneficiaries per the last will, automatically receive equitable interest in the property. When an executor or administrator qualifies, that person acquires legal title, subject to divestment when the estate has been administered so as to allow for the lawful passing of the legal title to those having an equitable interest. The resulting merger of the legal and equitable gives rise to [...] "perfect title," [...] often referred to as <b>marketable</b> <b>title.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The program {{involves}} purchasing from landowners {{what the}} county has defined as [...] "development rights." [...] Development rights are all of the property owner's rights, title, and interest in the property except raw ownership, the right of possession {{and the right to}} use the property for agriculture. The program involves the solicitation by the county of bids on a voluntary basis by property owners interested in selling the development rights of their property to the county. If a bidder's offer is accepted, the county pays to the bidder the sum of money equal to the appraised market value of the development rights by certified check, assuming that, following a title examination at county expense, it is determined that the bidder can convey good and <b>marketable</b> <b>title,</b> free of any encumbrances, to the county for his development rights.|$|E
5000|$|Developers Allen Pestaluky, Ben Kane, and Brian Fetter {{originally}} {{created the}} game for Global Game Jam 2014. There, they had a few Oculus Rift development kits and wanted {{to take advantage of}} the novelty of virtual reality. Their original game, a rollercoaster ride simulator, had attracted a number of people to try it out, but the three observed that while the wearer of the headset was enjoying themselves, those waiting for their turn did not share that enjoyment. This gave them the idea of a game that could be shared alike by both a headset wearer and those watching the wearer. Though they had several scenarios in mind, the idea of bomb defusing was the most interesting as well as something they could complete during the Game Jam. At the end of the Game Jam, they presented their game to the other participating developers, recording their own first playthrough of the game which they later posted to YouTube; the response both at the Game Jam and from YouTube viewers, calling the game [...] "hilarious", led the three to realize they were on to a <b>marketable</b> <b>title</b> and developed {{the game for}} a full release. In developing the various rules for disarming modules, these were initially created procedurally like the bombs themselves, so that they could be shifted around between various demonstrates at trade shows; though the final game has statically defined rules for defusing, there is a framework in place that can be used to mix up the rules in future versions.|$|E
