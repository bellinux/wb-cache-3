50|$|Due to {{limitations}} in the temperature that heat exchanger materials can withstand (approximately 2800 K), the indirect absorption designs cannot achieve specific impulses beyond 900 seconds (9 kN·s/kg = 9 km/s) (or up to 1000 seconds, see below). The direct absorption designs allow higher propellant temperatures and therefore higher specific impulses, approaching 1200 seconds. Even the lower specific impulse represents {{a significant increase}} over that of conventional chemical rockets, however, an increase that can provide substantial payload gains (45 percent for a LEO-to-GEO <b>mission)</b> at the <b>expense</b> of increased trip time (14 days compared to 10 hours).|$|R

Their plan {{was to assess the}} Portuguese fortifications and locate potential landing sites. After a failed attempt due to heavy rains and rough seas, they landed a small detachment the next day while the ships distracted the fort with a bombardment. They inspected the area and successfully completed the <b>mission</b> at the <b>expense</b> of three soldiers who were killed in action and another soldier who was injured. However, the Dutch council wanted additional information and instructed Coster, “if Portuguese of position are taken prisoner get them to confess by good or bad means.” ...|$|R

50|$|The {{total budget}} was €55M, of which €33.8M {{comes from a}} European Commission subsidy (representing 61% of the total budget), over 36 months.This budget {{essentially}} corresponded to staff costs (83.5%), with the second largest item being <b>mission</b> <b>expenses</b> (7.3% of the total budget). Management costs (and external communication costs) represented 4.1% of the total budget. Equipment fees represented 3%.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{government}} depended on import tariffs (also called Custom duties and ad-valorem taxes) for its income there was virtually no property tax. Under Spanish/Mexican rule, all landowners {{were expected to}} the Diezmo, a compulsory tithe to the Catholic Church of one tenth of the fruits of agriculture and animal husbandry, business profits or salaries. Priest salaries and <b>mission</b> <b>expenses</b> were paid out of this money and/or collected goods.|$|E
5000|$|Missionaries are {{expected}} to pay their own expenses while on the mission, often with assistance from family. In the past, each missionary paid his or her actual living expenses, but this approach created a disproportionate burden on missionaries who were assigned to more expensive areas of the world. In 1990, a new program was introduced to equalize the financial responsibility for each missionary {{and his or her}} family. Now, all young missionaries pay a flat monthly rate which is then redistributed according to regional costs of living. The cost of a mission varies based on the country of origin of the missionary; for missionaries from the United States, the cost is US$400 per month. The monthly rate helps to cover food, lodging, transportation, and other <b>mission</b> related <b>expenses.</b> Missionaries are asked to bring extra personal money for any personal items they would like to purchase. Once the money is received by the church it is then redistributed to the missionaries in amounts proportionate to the cost of living within the assigned mission area. [...] As families now contribute to a general fund for missionary expenses, the sum is deductible under many nations' tax policies regarding charitable gifts.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} widely {{recognized}} that the microfinance sector should pursue both social and financial objectives (double bottom line objective). However, with the growing success of microfinance, numerous microfinance institutions (MFIs) experience mission drift when they focus only on their financial <b>mission</b> at the <b>expense</b> of their social one. The mainstream incentive schemes set up by MFIs for their loan officers {{are one of the}} factors contributing to mission drift for several reasons. First, monetary rewards based on financial criteria may lead unscrupulous loan officers to push clients into overindebtedness. Second, financial incentives may {{have a negative effect on}} the prosocial motivation animating numerous microfinance loan officers. In this paper, we attempt to suggest, with a mathematical model, an optimal incentive scheme double bottom line on which MFIs could rely in order to preserve loan officers’ prosocial motivation while paying attention to their financial profit. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Active Debris Removal (ADR) {{methods are}} being {{developed}} due to a growing concern about the congestion on-orbit and sustainability of space flight. This study examined the probability of an on-orbit collision between an ADR target, whilst being de-orbited, and all the objects in the public catalogue published by the US Strategic Command. Such a collision could have significant effects because the target {{is likely to be}} located in a densely populated orbital regime and thus follow-on collisions could take place. Six impulsive and three low-thrust example ADR mission trajectories were screened for conjunctions. Extremely close conjunctions were found to result in as much as 99 % of the total accumulated collision probability. The need to avoid those conjunctions is highlighted, which raises concerns about ADR methods that do not support collision avoidance. Shortening the removal <b>missions,</b> at an <b>expense</b> of more ∆ V and so cost, will also lower their collision probability by reducing the number of conjunctions that they will experience...|$|R
50|$|Although in {{his first}} decade at P.I.M., Chilembwe had been {{reasonably}} successful, {{in the five years}} before his death, he faced a series of problems in the mission and in his personal life. From around 1910, he incurred several debts at a time when <b>mission</b> <b>expenses</b> were rising and funds from his American backers were drying up. Attacks of asthma, the death of a daughter, and his declining eyesight and general health may have deepened his sense of alienation and desperation.|$|E
50|$|The {{organization}} {{brings together}} physicians, dentists, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, pharmacists, and other non-medical volunteers who give medical and dental care {{to people in}} developing countries throughout the world. All of the missions are short-term (one or two weeks), professionally managed and affordable. Each team member makes a small donation to the organization {{which is used to}} cover the cost of transportation, lodging and <b>mission</b> <b>expenses.</b> Each year the schedule of missions is posted on the organization's website.|$|E
50|$|Then he {{received}} an unexpected letter. The return address said “Box B, Salt Lake City, Utah.” As every Mormon of that and several later generations knew, such a letter was Manwaring’s call {{to go on a}} mission for the church. He was granted six months to work and save enough to pay his <b>mission</b> <b>expenses.</b> Manwaring left Utah in February 1899. After three weeks in Syndey, Australia, he spent his mission years in Tasmania. He returned to Utah in March 1903.|$|E
40|$|A novel dynamic {{resource}} allocation model is introduced for efficient sharing of services provided by ad hoc assemblies of heterogeneous autonomous vehicles. A key contribution is the provision of capability to dynamically select sensors and platforms within constraints imposed by time dependencies, refueling, and transportation services. The problem is modeled as a connected network of nodes and formulated as an integer linear program. Solution fitness is prioritized over computation time. Simulation results of an illustrative scenario are used to demonstrate {{the ability of the}} model to plan for sensor selection, refueling, collaboration, and cooperation between heterogeneous resources. Prioritization of operational cost leads to missions that use cheaper resources but take longer to complete. Prioritization of completion time leads to shorter <b>missions</b> at the <b>expense</b> of increased overall resource cost. Missions can be successfully replanned through dynamic reallocation of new requests during a mission. Monte Carlo studies on systems of increasing complexity show that good solutions can be obtained using low time resolutions, with small time windows at a relatively low computational cost. In comparison with other approaches, the developed integer linear program model provides best solutions at the expense of longer computation time...|$|R
40|$|International {{peacekeeping}} {{missions are}} a political exercise, whereby the Canadian federal government touts {{its support for}} Canadian police involvement in <b>missions</b> at the <b>expense</b> of recognizing micro level issues of Canadian police officers serving abroad. The purpose of this thesis is to identify and address Canadian police officers’ pre-deployment and reintegration concerns {{as they relate to}} international peacekeeping missions. Twenty-five Canadian police officers who served on international peacekeeping operations participated in an in-person or telephone interview. Participants belonged to 11 different police agencies within the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario. The topic of policing and international peacekeeping will be introduced, followed by a discussion of the Canadian federal government’s “showing the flag” approach to missions. Literature that focuses on police officers’ existing pre-deployment and reintegration concerns will be addressed. The chosen methodology for this thesis will then be identified, followed by the findings for this study. It is argued that, for this sample, Canadian police officers’ issues continue to remain unacknowledged due to the political context in which missions are operating. Policy and practice implications of this study and training recommendations for the RCMP’s International Peacekeeping Operations Branch are considered. This thesis will conclude with a discussion of the strengths and limitations of this research, recommendations for the various Canadian police agencies involvement in deployment and will provide suggestions for future research...|$|R
5000|$|Davis v. United States, , {{was a case}} {{decided by}} the United States Supreme Court.

Reg. § 1.170A-1(g) (1989), a position that lower courts had rejected. In a unanimous decision, the Court ruled that these contributions could {{not be seen as}} [...] "charitable contributions" [...] under provisions of that statute.|$|E
50|$|Moore and Fraser {{arrived in}} Yichang by January 1897 and began {{language}} training. Both worked tirelessly {{to advance the}} education and well-being of Chinese women. Street life belonged to boys and men whereas Chinese girls and women, {{many of whom had}} bound feet, were confined to the Chinese home. Both Moore and Fraser saw the benefit of creating a girls’ boarding school whereby girls and young women could receive an education without the social stigma of walking to and from school in public. They also expanded a women’s training school by teaching lace making and embroidery. In addition to providing income to Chinese women, these items were sold to parishioners in Scotland and New Zealand and funded {{a large portion of the}} women’s <b>mission</b> <b>expenses,</b> making much of the work self-sustaining. The Church of Scotland had many foreign missions across the globe competing for funding. Moore had the advantage of leveraging her network in New Zealand for reliable support, which contributed to the success and expansion of the Women’s Mission over the years.|$|E
5000|$|The LDS Church {{is one of}} {{the most}} active modern {{practitioners}} of missionary work, reporting that it had over 74,000 full-time missionaries worldwide at the end of 2015 (as well as nearly 32,000 part-time church-service missionaries). [...] Most full-time Mormon missionaries are single young men and women in their late teens and early twenties and older couples no longer with children in the home. Missionaries are often assigned to serve far from their homes, including in other countries. Many missionaries learn a new language at a missionary training center as part of their assignment. Missions typically last two years for males, 18 months for females, and 6 to 18 months for older couples. The LDS Church strongly encourages, but does not require, missionary service for young men. All Mormon missionaries serve voluntarily and do not receive a salary for their work; they typically finance missions themselves or with assistance from family or other church members. Many Latter-day Saints save money during their teenage years to cover their <b>mission</b> <b>expenses.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The viceroy {{ordered a}} second {{expedition}} {{of the area}} in 1754. Former governor of Texas Pedro de Rábago y Terán explored the same area and concurred with Galvan's recommendation. The people of San Antonio were enthusiastic about the proposal, hoping that a new northern settlement would protect their town from raids. The governor still hesitated, and in 1756 asked Lieutenant Governor Bernardo de Miranda to again explore the area. [...] While exploring, Miranda heard rumors from the Apache of silver deposits near San Saba and again recommended the area.In 1757, authorities finally approved the mission.

5000|$|Romero de Terreros {{attempted}} to endow a convent {{on the grounds}} of the College of San Fernando de México in 1756, but the head of the seminary refused the request. [...] After hearing that authorities were considering establishing a mission to the Lipan Apache tribe in Spanish Texas, Romero de Terreros volunteered to provide initial funding for the effort. He agreed to give 150,000 pesos to support 20 missionaries over a three-year-period and to purchase all church furnishings and other necessities. In return, he asked that the missionaries come from the College of San Fernando de México and the College of Santa Cruz de Querétaro, and that his cousin, Father Alonso Giraldo de Terreros, be given responsibility for the mission. [...] After three years, the government would pay <b>mission</b> <b>expenses,</b> and the government would also fund a garrison to protect the missionaries. Unlike most missions, this one would report to the viceroy instead of the governor. Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá was established in 1757. The mission was destroyed, and Father Terreros killed, the following year by Comanche who were angered that the Spanish had allied with the Comanche's traditional enemies, the Apache.|$|E
