Following this, Fatboy develops feelings for his friend Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), though Whitney is involved with Tyler Moon (Tony Discipline).

Fatboy buys a car for Whitney, but she is initially angry, saying she doesn't want to be owned. However, Whitney relents and accepts the gift. Fatboy notices that Tyler continues to want Whitney, and so warns him off. However, after Whitney gets angry at Lucy (now Hetti Bywater) for dancing with Fatboy, Lucy convinces Tyler to talk to her. They accidentally get locked in a bathroom and Fatboy assumes Whitney has cheated on him, so ends the relationship. Fatboy later visits Tyler, who shows Fatboy that the bathroom door sticks, and Tyler says that he is happy for Fatboy and Whitney as a couple. However, Whitney soon feels smothered by Fatboy's affection, and when he is about to take Whitney away on holiday, she refuses, and when they kiss she says it is like kissing a friend.

Especially on warm days, the market activities resulted in a foul odor and the conditions were described as a potential health threat in 1818. The architect Christian Frederik Hansen made a proposal for a market building on the square in the 1820s but it was not realized. In 1842, the number of <b>market</b> <b>stalls</b> had grown to 82. The debate about better conditions for the market trade resurged and a complex of market building design by Peter Heinrich Christoph Hagemann was built in 1834 - 46. It was made of cast iron and contained 68 large and 10 small shops. The <b>market</b> <b>stalls</b> ran along the streets Lille Kongensgade, Nikolajgade, Vingårdsstræde and Admiralgade. The butchers that faced the street sold meat of superior quality while the <b>market</b> <b>stalls</b> that faced the central yard, colloquially known as [...] "The Stomach" [...] (Danish: Maven), sold second-rate, [...] "black label" [...] meat.
