500|$|Two twin [...] Hotchkiss {{machine gun}} mounts were fitted as anti-strafing weapons. These {{had a high}} rate of fire at 450 rpm, but this was {{hampered}} by the awkward 30-round <b>magazine</b> <b>feed.</b> Initially they were mounted {{on each side of the}} forward superstructure at deck level and fitted with gun shields to protect them against the spray. Trials revealed the limitations of these positions with poor arcs of fire and the gun shields obstructed the aimer's view of the target. Following the completion of the trials the guns were relocated to a new deckhouse between the bridge and turret Nr. 2 and their gun shields removed. 2500 rounds per barrel were stored in the forward magazines.|$|E
2500|$|As noted above, the {{cartridge}} {{was designed to}} be 100% compatible with the M4 platform. This included the buffer, buffer spring, GI magazines, many aftermarket [...]223/5.56 magazines, and magazine well. In [...]223/5.56 caliber, cartridges stack in a staggered (double stack) fashion. However, with the much larger [...]458 SOCOM, rounds [...] "single stack" [...] without any modification to the standard GI <b>magazine</b> <b>feed</b> lips or follower, making it the most versatile and cost effective big bore offering in an AR-15 platform. A standard 20-round 5.56mm NATO magazine can hold seven [...]458 SOCOM rounds and a standard 30-round 5.56mm NATO magazine can hold ten [...]458 SOCOM rounds.|$|E
2500|$|The major {{difference}} between the two designs was that the BSA weapons were chambered for [...]303 British ammunition, but the Savage guns were chambered for [...]30-06 cartridges, which necessitated some difference in the <b>magazine,</b> <b>feed</b> mechanism, bolt, barrel, extractors, and gas operation system. Savage did make Lewis guns in [...]303 British calibre, though. The Model 1916 and Model 1917 were exported to Canada and the United Kingdom, and a few were supplied to the US military, particularly the Navy. The Savage Model 1917 was generally produced in [...]30-06 caliber. A number of these guns were supplied to the UK under lend-lease during the Second World War.|$|E

5000|$|The HS [...]50 M1 is an {{evolution}} of the HS [...]50. The biggest differences are: it is magazine fed from a five-round <b>magazine</b> <b>feeding</b> horizontally left from the receiver, has a longer top Picatinny rail and more Picatinny rails on the side, an adjustable cheekpiece, a newly designed fixable bipod, and a monopod at the buttstock.|$|R
5000|$|The T68 M249 Magazine is {{designed}} after the real M249 magazine for the Squad Automatic Weapon; this magazine holds 200 [...]68-caliber paintballs, like most hoppers.

50|$|A weapon's {{stock is}} made of a polymer {{material}} and {{is attached to the}} lower receiver. It has provisions for mounting a folding height-adjustable bipod. The APR feed system consists of a detachable 10-round stainless steel box magazine. When the magazine is empty, it stops the forward motion of the bolt. The <b>magazine</b> <b>feeds</b> through the lower receiver into the upper receiver and is held by a magazine catch, which is integrated into the trigger group.|$|R

5000|$|Building custom rifles {{or having}} a rifle re-chambed for the [...]416 Remington Magnum is a fairly {{straightforward}} and easy option. Any rifle action which can handle the full length magnum cartridge such as [...]375 H&H Magnum requires only a barrel change and perhaps some work on the <b>magazine</b> <b>feed</b> system. On the other hand, the larger Rigby and Weatherby cartridges would require an appropriate extra large magnum action {{as a starting point}} ...|$|E
50|$|Many {{light machine}} guns ({{such as the}} Bren gun or the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle) were magazine-fed. Others, such as the MG 34, could be fed either from a belt or from a magazine. Modern light machine guns are {{designed}} to fire more rounds of a smaller caliber and, as such, tend to be belt-fed from a detachable box magazine, some such as the FN Minimi will also accept rifle <b>magazine</b> <b>feeding</b> as an auxiliary measure when belted ammunition has been exhausted.|$|R
50|$|Standard US pattern 155 mm {{ammunition}} {{can also}} be fired, although US primers proved problematic for the primer <b>magazine</b> and <b>feed</b> due to their variation in size.|$|R
50|$|In {{terms of}} basic design, the Evans repeating rifle {{is similar to}} the Spencer Repeating Rifle. However, the Evans has a rotary helical {{magazine}} in the buttstock, and cartridges are fed into the breech by cycling the cocking lever/trigger guard. Also, the magazine of the Evans has a much higher capacity than that of the Spencer, up to 34 rounds. The Evans holds four rows of cartridges which are loaded through a trapdoor in the buttplate. Each time the action is cycled, the <b>magazine</b> <b>feeds</b> the next cartridge to the breech in a helical pattern.|$|R
50|$|Another {{variant of}} the SPW {{requested}} by the US Special Operations Forces is the Mk 46 Mod 0 that incorporates a lightweight fluted barrel but lacks the <b>magazine</b> <b>feed</b> system, vehicle mounting lugs and carry handle. A railed forearm ensures modularity and mission-adaptability permitting the use of flashlights, vertical grips, and infrared laser designators. An improved variant known as the Mk 46 Mod 1 with an improved forward rail and lightweight titanium bipod has been adopted by the United States Navy.|$|E

5000|$|Remington has {{developed}} an improved version of the M24 rifle, known as the M24A2. The A2 model features a detachable 5-round magazine, top-mounted and adjustable side-mounted Picatinny rails (advertised by Remington as [...] "MARS", or Modular Accessory Rail System), barrel modifications designed to accommodate a sound suppressor, and an improved H-S Precision PST-25 stock with adjustable cheek height and length of pull. Existing M24s can also be converted into M24A2s, which replaces the stock and adds the new detachable <b>magazine</b> <b>feed.</b> The conversion requires a re-barreling of the weapon so it can take the OPS silencer.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{versions}} of the Vepr-12 were produced by Izhmash, with production moving to the Molot factory where the shotgun was redesigned and mass-produced. The Vepr-12 {{is intended to be}} a direct competitor to the widely popular Saiga-12 shotgun already produced by Izhmash. Like the Saiga, the Vepr-12 was designed to be a versatile weapons platform, capable of being used by hunters and professional shooters alike. With these considerations in mind, Molot introduced unique features, such as the ambidextrous safety selector, the bolt hold-open mechanism and a simplified <b>magazine</b> <b>feeding</b> mechanism.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s the HK21’s design was {{simplified}} and the feed mechanism was modified. The machine gun's weight was increased, a carrying handle and a hooked buttstock with improved buffer mechanism were also added. Since then, the HK21 was offered in two main variants: the HK21A1 general-purpose machine gun (with a different belt feed mechanism) and the HK11A1 automatic rifle (optimized for <b>magazine</b> <b>feed</b> only). The HK11A1 proved {{more successful in}} export sales and {{was adopted by the}} Hellenic Army and several African and Asian armies. Both weapons, as in the original HK21, can be converted to chamber the 5.56×45mm NATO round by replacing the appropriate components.|$|E

5000|$|The rifle design {{began with}} {{seventeen}} concepts; however, after the concepts were investigated and trade-offs were analysed, only two remained for the cased round, and {{two for the}} caseless round. [...] The two designs for each ammunition type revolve around two magazine approaches. One uses the standard mechanism, with springs inside the <b>magazine</b> <b>feeding</b> rounds into the weapon; the other uses a 'weapon powered' approach, presumably to reduce the extra weight and space that springs create in magazines. Both magazine designs are focussed around high capacity. The rifle designs are undergoing the same simulated, structural, and kinematic analyses as the LMG. [...] Both a working rifle and accompanying ammunition prototypes have been made, but it uncertain if or when the program {{will result in a}} new rifle for the US military.|$|R
