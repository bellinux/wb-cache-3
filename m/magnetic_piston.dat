40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{and efficacy}} of applying magnetic bearings to free-piston Stirling-cycle power conversion machinery currently being developed for long-term space missions are assessed. The study was performed for a 50 -kWe Reference Stirling Space Power Converter (RSSPC) which currently uses hydrostatic gas bearings to support the reciprocating displacer and power <b>piston</b> assemblies. Active <b>magnetic</b> bearings of the attractive electromagnetic type are feasible for the RSSPC power <b>piston.</b> <b>Magnetic</b> support of the displacer assembly would require unacceptable changes {{to the design of}} the current RSSPC. However, magnetic suspension of both displacer and power piston is feasible for a relative-displacer version of the RSSPC. Magnetic suspension of the RSSPC power piston can potentially increase overall efficiency by 0. 5 to 1 percent (0. 1 to 0. 3 efficiency points). Magnetic bearings will also overcome several operational concerns associated with hydrostatic gas bearing systems. These advantages, however, are accompanied by a 5 percent increase in specific mass of the RSSPC...|$|R
30|$|In the air-powered vehicle, the {{structure}} of <b>magnetic</b> rings of <b>piston</b> and <b>magnetic</b> inductors ensures the continuously working of the motor, what is more, the advantage of expansion energy of compressed air. As shown from Figure  2, the whole processes {{of one of the}} hydraulic pistons mainly contain four processes. At first, when the air was put into the pneumatic chamber, the hydraulic piston moves forward considered the first process. When the piston gets to the place of magnetic inductor, the source of air is stopped inputting by the controller, which can be considered as the second process. At this process, the vehicle is completely driven by the expansion energy of the compressed air in the pneumatic chamber. When the piston gets to the place of magnetic inductor B, it works in reverse due to the change of the magnetic switching valve. The third and fourth processes are the same as the symmetrical hydraulic piston works in the same way. The time of first and third working processes of the pistons are completely using expansion energy, and the energy can be saved to some extent.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{investigate}} different methods do measure velocity of pistons in pneumatic cylinders at Bosch Rexroth Teknik AB. Through information of velocity the adjustment of a cylinders damping can be done easier. A future transducer will be used by salesmen, service personnel and customers. This requires a sensor that is easy to apply and use. It is also desirable that the sensor is cheap. A number of possible methods to measure velocity have been presented. In general, the requirements above {{have been difficult to}} fulfill. In almost all pneumatic cylinders, magnets are mounted on the <b>piston.</b> <b>Magnetic</b> sensors are then used for proximity sensing to detect its extreme positions. A similar way can be used for velocity sensing. Assume that two magnetic sensors are placed on a fixed distance between each other, along the pistons direction of motion. The time to travel between the sensors is an expression for the velocity of the piston. One way to solve the problem has been chosen and the accuracy of this method has been verified. This has been done under the assumption that the errors due to mounting is neglected and that the direction of sensitivity is idealistic...|$|R

50|$|The {{fundamental}} {{basis for}} induced voltage in {{a magnetic field}} comes from Faraday's law describing an induced electromotive force (EMF) as follows:Emf = -N (∆Φb / ∆t)(Nave, C. R. 2011).This implies that {{as the number of}} magnetic flux lines increase or decrease there is a subsequent induced voltage of negative or positive polarity. However the relationship of electric forces and magnetic forces were summed up in Lorentz Force Law as F as follows:F = qE + qv x BHere all three forces were found to be perpendicular to each other (Nave, a, 2011). Thus Lorentz gave specially oriented direction to each of the forces allowing us to predict the direction of forces within the inductive pump architecture. Salamey further investigated the relationship of magnetic flux to circumferential area about the magnetic field where most of the magnetic forces were found to create mechanical forces used to direct the motion of the piston. Salamey further describes in his second patent the incorporation of a magnetic field gap. The gap is defined as a region of non-magnetic conduction circumferentially located {{at either end of the}} piston bore. The magnetic gap allows for increased propagation of magnetic flux through the <b>magnetic</b> <b>piston</b> body causing an increased force pulling the piston towards the magnetic end-pole (Salamey, 1999).|$|E

Researchers have been interested in its unique applications {{for a wide range of}} flow control to thermal management of electronics applications. Synthetic jets are made up of actuators such as piezoelectric, <b>magnetic,</b> or linear <b>piston</b> technology etc. In this study, we performed an experimental and numerical investigation of a piezoelectric disk deflection over a range of frequencies in order to understand the performance for low and high frequency synthetic jets. First, we performed a numerical analysis of a piezoelectric based synthetic jet and, validated computational result with experimental findings. Numerical models are performed by using commercial finite element software. To understand the size effect on the operating frequency, three jets with different sizes are manufactured and examined. Two different low frequency synthetic jets manufactured in our laboratory and a commercially available high frequency jet are included in the present study. Heat transfer performance is given as an enhancement over natural convection heat transfer. The heat transfer enhancement factor of each of these jets with respect to natural convection is measured over a 25. 4 × 25. 4 (mm) vertical heater. Finally, power consumption of the low and high frequency synthetic jets were measured and compared. It is found that disk deflection and operating frequency are directly related to heat transfer enhancement factor, if the Helmholtz frequency of a cavity has no effect on the performance of a jet. The Helmholtz frequency of each jet was calculated to ensure that it has no effect on the synthetic jet, but we found that the commercial synthetic jet took partial advantage of Helmholtz phenomena to enhance the performances at high frequencies.

40|$|Two plasma channels, {{corresponding}} {{to a slow}} capillary discharge and a. fast capillary discharge plasma, are investigated numerically. A long-lifetime parabolic plasma channel is formed in the slow capillary discharge channel. Its radial density profile {{is determined by the}} energy balance between Ohmic heating and thermal conduction, together with force balance. The profile and the on-axis density value vary only weakly with the peak value of the slow discharge current (300 - 600 A). A rather dynamic plasma channel is formed under the compression by a <b>magnetic</b> <b>piston</b> in the fast capillary discharge channel. In a narrow time window of the order of nanoseconds a, suitable hollow relatively low density channel is reached, followed by a shock-dominated rebound phase. The on-axis density minimum features of these two channels make both of them suitable guiding channels for the laser wakefield accelerators. In particular, a low-density channel (n(e) similar to 5 x 10 (16) cm(- 3)) formed in the fast capillary discharge is in favor of controlled beam injection. but requires precise timing, while the slow capillary discharge is in essence steady. We discuss possible strategies for using them in a segmented approach. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three parts. In Part I, it is shown that looping trajectories cannot exist in finite amplitude stationary hydromagnetic waves propagating across a magnetic field in a quasi-neutral cold collision-free plasma. In Part II, time-dependent solutions in series expansion are presented for the <b>magnetic</b> <b>piston</b> problem, which describes waves propagating into a quasi-neutral cold collision-free plasma, ensuing from magnetic disturbances on the boundary of the plasma. The expansion is equivalent to Picard's successive approximations. It is then shown that orbit crossings of plasma particles occur on the boundary for strong disturbances and inside the plasma for weak disturbances. In Part III, the existence of periodic waves propagating at an arbitrary angle to the magnetic field in a plasma is demonstrated by Stokes expansions in amplitude. Then stability analysis is made for such periodic waves with respect to side-band frequency disturbances. It is shown that waves of slow mode are unstable whereas waves of fast mode are stable if the frequency is below the cutoff frequency. The cutoff frequency depends on the propagation angle. For longitudinal propagation the cutoff frequency is equal to one-fourth of the electron's gyrofrequency. For transverse propagation the cutoff frequency is so high that waves of all frequencies are stable. ...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) researchers have started exploring the design space of Medical Capsule Robots (MCRs) : embedded micro-systems that can operate autonomously within {{the human body and}} can diagnose, prevent, monitor, and cure diseases. Although the {{research in the area of}} MCRs is an active topic and has grown exponentially, current devices provide only limited functionalities because their design process is expensive and time consuming. To open this research field to a wider community and, at the same time, create better designs through advanced tool support, in our previous works we presented a design environment for the rapid development of MCRs. In this paper, this environment was adopted to design a Drug Delivery Capsule (DDC) based on a coil-magnet-piston mechanism. The force of the coil acting on the <b>magnetic</b> <b>piston</b> and the drug release profile were modeled and assessed on bench-top with a maximum relative error below 5 %. Then, in vivo trials were performed to validate the DDC functionality with a scheduled drug release profile for a 5 h and 24 min procedure.

40|$|Collisionless shocks are {{a common}} {{phenomena}} that occur in astrophysical and terrestrial space environments {{with a wide variety}} of physical characteristics, but are generally preformed, steady state when observed. This thesis studies the transient state that leads to the formation of a dissipation dominated, quasi-perpendicular, subcritical collisionless shock. To achieve this, two experimental platforms were conceived: (1) utilizing the Large Plasma Device (LaPD) at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to produce a magnetized ambient-plasma and the Phoenix Laser System to create an expanding debris-plasma to shock the ambient-plasma and (2) installing a large (56 cm diameter) pulsed Helmholtz Coil (Bo < 1. 25 kG) into the target chamber at the Trident Laser Facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in which the ambient- and debris-plasma were created with two consecutive laser pulses. As the debris-plasma expands through the magnetized ambient-plasma a diamagnetic cavity is formed that expels the enclosed magnetic field and compresses the field upstream, outside the cavity. The formed magnetic compression acts as a piston to energize and shock the ambient-plasma, when conditions are suitable. The goal of this dissertation is to produce, identify, and quantify the magnetic characteristics associated with coupling of energy and momentum from a Laser-Produced Plasma (debris-plasma) into a magnetized ambient-plasma with the use of the driven <b>magnetic</b> <b>piston...</b>|$|E

The robot is designed to locate injured victims and life triangle in debris, to create {{a map of the}} disaster area and to collect the necessary information needed by digging and support robots in order to the database center. This robot enables us to rescue the victim in the shortest time with minimum injury. This will let us risking the lives of the rescue teams much less as well as rescuing much more victim alive.

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityPulse detonation engines (PDEs) {{are the focus of}} increasing attention due to their potentially superior performance over conventional engines, as either an alternate for an airbreathing engine or a rocket engine. Due to its unsteady chamber pressure, the Pulse Detonation Rocket Engine (PDRE) system will either be over or under-expanded {{for the majority of the}} cycle, with energy applied toward suboptimal impulse generation, especially at very high speeds and high altitudes. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) augmentation offers the opportunity to extract energy and apply it to a separate stream in the engine where the net thrust will be increased. With MHD augmentation, such as in the Pulse Detonation Rocket-Induced MHD Ejector (PDRIME) concept, energy could be extracted from the high-speed fluid in the nozzle and reapplied elsewhere in the fluid as a body force. The present work explored the potential performance of such propulsion systems. In the PDRIME, at the appropriate point in the PDRE cycle, the MHD energy extracted from the PDRE's nozzle is reintroduced to a separate bypass tube by an MHD accelerator which acts to accelerate the bypass air and impart a net positive thrust to the system over the course of engine cycle. An alternative configuration, involving application of a "magnetic piston" in the PDRE chamber, with and without PDRIME bypass, is also explored. The present simulations mainly involve use of detailed transient numerical simulations (quasi-one-dimensional and two-dimensional) for the exploration of the PDRE, PDRIME, <b>magnetic</b> <b>piston,</b> and other geometries, and comparisons with a simpler blowdown model are also made. Results show that potential performance gains and operational benefits for specific flight Mach number and altitude conditions may be achieved and that conditions creating the performance improvements are similarly predicted between quasi-lD and 2 D numerical simulations...|$|E
40|$|Magnetoforming of tube or {{sheet metal}} parts can {{significantly}} extend the range of geometries conceivable with state-of-the-art forming methods. A major advantage is the considerably higher forming speed of the process achievable by using a <b>magnetic</b> <b>piston</b> without inertia. Key for this technology {{is the development of}} reliable, long-lifetime, high current pulse power generators able to deliver tens to hundreds of kiloamps of peak current to a mainly inductive load which is highly variable in time during the forming process. A high-current, high energy pulse generator for electromagnetic forming of large area sheet metal has been developed and was taken into operation. Design criteria were reliability and safety for all possible load cases, including short circuits and short-circuiting loads under operation, at nominal peak currents of up to 200 kA and peak pulse energies of up to 100 kJ. In order to comply with the safety requirements, an all-solid-state design has been chosen using high power semiconductor switches for pulse forming instead of ignitrons or spark gaps. Due to constraints concerning space and manageability, the coupling between the load and the pulse forming unit is achieved via a semi-rigid bundle of high voltage cables, allowing an adjustment of the carrier of the forming coil while being electrically connected to each other. We report on the development of a pulse generator for peak currents of 50 kA to up to 200 kA at a pulse width of typically around 100 µs, depending on the load parameters. In order to meet lifetime requirements suitable for industrial applications, the short circuit handling capability of peak currents of up to 450 kA is a major issue in the pulse generator design. A modular 3 -branch design of parallel capacitor banks has been adopted to achieve the requirements concerning reliability, lifetime, and short circuit handling. The prototype pulse generator is based upon off-the-shelf devices, including high-current semiconductor switches. First operating results of the commissioning phase of the installation are reported...|$|E
40|$|We have {{performed}} several thousand high-energy laser {{shots in the}} LAPD to investigate the dynamics of an exploding laser-produced plasma in a large ambient magneto-plasma. Debris-ions expanding at super-Alfvenic velocity (up to MA= 1. 5) expel the ambient magnetic field, creating a large (> 20 cm) diamagnetic cavity. We observed field compressions of up to B/B{sub 0 } = 1. 5 {{at the edge of}} the bubble, consistent with the MHD jump conditions, as well as localized electron heating {{at the edge of the}} bubble. Two-dimensional hybrid simulations reproduce these measurements well and show that the majority of the ambient ions are energized by the <b>magnetic</b> <b>piston</b> to super-Alfvenic speeds and swept outside the bubble volume. Nonlinear shear-Alfven waves ({delta}B/B{sub 0 } > 25 %) are radiated from the cavity with a coupling efficiency of 70 % from magnetic energy in the bubble to the wave. While the data is consistent with a weak magneto-sonic shock, the experiments were severely limited by the low ambient plasma densities (10 {sup 12 } cm{sup - 3 }). 2 D hybrid simulations indicate that future experiments with the new LAPD plasma source and densities in excess of 10 {sup 13 } cm{sup - 3 } will drive full-blown collisionless shocks with MA> 10 over several c/wpi and shocked Larmor radii. In a separate experiment at the LANL Trident laser facility we {{have performed}} a proof-of-principle experiment at higher densities to demonstrate key elements of collisionless shocks in laser-produced magnetized plasmas with important implications to NIF.

40|$|Collisionless shocks are {{ubiquitous}} in many space and astrophysical plasmas. However, since space shocks are largely steady-state, spacecraft {{are not well}} suited to studying shock formation in situ. This work {{is concerned with the}} generation and study in a laboratory setting of magnetized, quasi-perpendicular collisionless shocks relevant to space shocks. Experiments performed at the Large Plasma Device (LAPD) at UCLA and the Trident Laser Facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) combined a <b>magnetic</b> <b>piston</b> driven by a high-energy laser (Raptor at UCLA or Trident at LANL) incident on a carbon target with a preformed, magnetized background plasma. Magnetic flux measurements and 2 D hybrid simulations indicate that a magnetosonic pulse consistent with a low-Mach number collisionless shock was formed in the ambient plasma. The characteristics of the shock are analyzed and compared to other experiments in which no shock or a shock precursor formed. The results and simulations reveal that the various experimental conditions can be organized into weak and moderate coupling regimes, in which no shock forms, and a strong coupling regime, in which a full shock forms. A framework for studying these regimes and designing future shock experiments is devised. Early-time laser-plasma parameters necessary to characterize the different shock coupling regimes are studied through experiments performed at the LAPD and Phoenix laboratory at UCLA. In addition to spectroscopic and fast-gate filtered photography, the experiments utilize a custom Thomson scattering diagnostic, optimized for a novel electron density and temperature regime where the transition from collective to non-collective scattering could be spatially resolved. Data from the experiments and 3 D analytic modeling indicate that the laser-plasma is best fit at early times with an isentropic, adiabatic fluid model and is consistent with a recombination-dominated plasma for which the electron temperature T_e∝ t^- 1. In addition, spectroscopic measurements and 1 D radiation-MHD simulations reveal that the laser-plasma velocity distribution is segregated by charge state, with the fastest ion species having the highest charge state, but the slowest species having the most mass. The results also suggest that the fastest non-trivial ion population (the dominant charge state) at typical laser intensities (I_ 0 ∼ 10 ^ 11 W cm^- 2) is CV (C^+ 4) ...|$|E
