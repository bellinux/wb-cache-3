Thai manufacturing and exporting SMEs experience decreasing returns to scale even though their technical efficiency in production {{is found to be}} relatively high. Results from estimations using both approaches also reveal that firm age, medium-sized enterprises compared with small-sized enterprises, firm location in Bangkok, foreign investment and government assistance are significantly and positively related to firm technical efficiency. Focusing on the technical efficiency of SMEs exporting to different destinations, those exporting to OCEANIA perform the best, followed by SMEs exporting to ASEAN, East Asia, and North and South America, while SMEs exporting to Europe experience no significant effect upon their technical efficiency from doing so, where SMEs exporting {{to the rest of the}} world is the base exporting SME group. The results also reveal that SMEs in the chemicals and related products sector perform the best, followed by SMEs in the machinery and transport equipment sector, where the <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>manufactured</b> <b>articles</b> sector is used as the base sector. The manufactured goods sector and food, beverages and tobacco sector are also found to perform better than the <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>manufactured</b> <b>articles</b> sector.

40|$|Rauch (JIE, Vol. 48, 1999) proposes the {{hypothesis}} that proximity and common language / colonial ties are more important for differentiated products than for homogeneous products in forming price information and matching international buyers and sellers.

In this paper, by using SITC and monopolistic competition hypothesis, I present the result that machinery, transport equipment and <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>manufactured</b> <b>articles,</b> which are classified into differentiated products, have little price information effect, which makes Rauch’s result ambiguous. This paper also shows the fact that the network hypothesis of trade is appropriate to the trade of crude materials, while monopolistic competition hypothesis is appropriate to the trade of mineral fuels.

30|$|One {{way other}} authors have {{identified}} the quality of exports is through the composition of parts and components and final goods using data from UNCOMTRADE (Athukorala 2010). This indicator {{is based on the}} assumption that export quality improves as the share of parts and components increases in total exports. This information only exists for Chapter 7 (machinery and transport equipment,) including power-generating machinery and equipment; machinery specialized for particular industries; metalworking machinery; general industrial machinery and equipment, n.e.s., and machine parts, n.e.s.; office machines and automatic data-processing machines; telecommunications and sound recording and reproducing apparatus and equipment; electrical machinery, apparatus and appliances, n.e.s., and electrical parts thereof (including non-electrical counterparts, n.e.s., of electrical household-type equipment); road vehicles (including air-cushion vehicles); and other transport equipment; and Chapter 8 (<b>miscellaneous</b> <b>manufactured</b> <b>articles</b> that, among others, includes professional, scientific, and controlling instruments and apparatus, n.e.s.; photographic apparatus, equipment and supplies, and optical goods, n.e.s.; watches and clocks). The grounding assumption of this criterion to evaluate export quality can only be accepted as valid if we consider countries that specialize in assembling products with imported parts and components. Nonetheless, only some products included in these chapters have had international fragmentation of production. Further, even when dealing with this type of production, it seems risky to directly associate low export quality with the export of final goods.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{relationship}} between exchange rate volatility and foreign trade. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the effect of exchange rate volatility on the foreign trade of Visegrad Countries on bilateral level as well as on the commodity level for different traded product groups determined by SITC classification. An empirical analysis uses territorial and commodity structuring of foreign trade data and is realized for the period 1999 :Q 1 – 2014 :Q 3. We use panel regression applied to the gravity model of foreign trade for analyzing the exchange rate volatility effects. Exchange rate volatility leads to decreasing of foreign trade turnover on the bilateral level. In the case of Slovakia, a negative effect on foreign trade was identified in all groups except chemicals, raw materials and raw materials for food purposes. For Poland was these effects detected for trade with mineral fuels, lubricants, animal fats, oils and waxes, while other products show their negative effects of exchange rate volatility on international trade. For Hungary, all statistically significant coefficients are negative and thus confirm the assumption of reduction of foreign trade turnover with increased exchange rate volatility. For the Czech Republic, the negative effect of exchange rate volatility was reflected in trade flows of food and live animals, animal and vegetable fats, machinery, transport equipment and <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>manufactured</b> <b>articles...</b>|$|E
