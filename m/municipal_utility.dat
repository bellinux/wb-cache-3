5|$|The 1982 {{amendment}} to the bailout eligibility standard went into effect on August 5, 1984. Between that date and 2013, 196 jurisdictions bailed out of coverage through 38 bailout actions; in each instance, the Attorney General consented to the bailout request. Between that date and 2009, all jurisdictions that bailed out were located in Virginia. In 2009, a <b>municipal</b> <b>utility</b> jurisdiction in Texas bailed out after the Supreme Court's opinion in Northwest Austin <b>Municipal</b> <b>Utility</b> District No. 1 v. Holder (2009), which held that local governments that do not register voters {{have the ability to}} bail out. After this ruling, jurisdictions succeeded in at least 20 bailout actions before the Supreme Court held in Shelby County v. Holder (2013) that the coverage formula was unconstitutional.|$|E

Public education is provided by independent school districts, which may be organized as elementary districts, high school districts, unified school districts combining elementary and high school grades, or community college districts, and are managed by an elected school board.

40|$|After storm-related power outages, {{many have}} {{recommended}} municipalizing investor-owned utilities, claiming that profit-making utilities have insufficient incentive {{to prepare for}} storms. I provide empirical evidence that <b>municipal</b> <b>utilities</b> spend more on maintenance of their distribution network than investor-owned utilities.

As part of this project, that tunnel – the Claremont Tunnel – was seismically retrofitted. Additionally, EBMUD created a second route to bring water to these west-of-the-hills customers through the Southern Loop Bypass near Castro Valley. The Southern Loop was completed in 2002, while the seismic retrofitting of the Claremont tunnel was completed in February 2007.|$|E
5000|$|The {{majority}} of the <b>municipal</b> <b>utilities</b> purchase electricity through an interconnection with Nova Scotia Power; however, some, including the Berwick Electric Light Commission, have supplementary generating assets such as small hydro stations.

The proposed charges {{would have been a}} one-time [...] "exit fee" [...] payable by the <b>municipal</b> <b>utilities</b> in exchange for ending NSP's monopoly on the wholesale supply of electricity.

SENAPA and SEDAPAL were placed under the direct authority of the President. In 1994, a new law was passed that created the legal figure of the <b>municipal</b> <b>utility</b> (EPS) as an entity that is legally and financially separate of the municipality.

25|$|Sacramento County (along with {{a portion}} of {{adjacent}} Placer County) is served by a customer-owned electric utility, the Sacramento <b>Municipal</b> <b>Utility</b> District (SMUD).

Today SMUD is the sixth-largest public electric utility in the U.S., and is a leader for innovative programs and services, including the development of clean fuel resources, such as solar power.
