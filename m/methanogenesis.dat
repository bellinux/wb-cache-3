5|$|Archaea {{are genetically}} {{distinct}} from bacteria and eukaryotes, {{with up to}} 15% of the proteins encoded by any one archaeal genome being unique to the domain, although most of these unique genes have no known function. Of {{the remainder of the}} unique proteins that have an identified function, most belong to the Euryarchaea and are involved in <b>methanogenesis.</b> The proteins that archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes share form a common core of cell function, relating mostly to transcription, translation, and nucleotide metabolism. Other characteristic archaeal features are the organization of genes of related function—such as enzymes that catalyze steps in the same metabolic pathway into novel operons, and large differences in tRNA genes and their aminoacyl tRNA synthetases.|$|E
5|$|Some Euryarchaeota are methanogens (archaea {{that produce}} methane {{as a result}} of metabolism) living in {{anaerobic}} environments, such as swamps. This form of metabolism evolved early, and it is even possible that the first free-living organism was a methanogen. A common reaction involves the use of carbon dioxide as an electron acceptor to oxidize hydrogen. <b>Methanogenesis</b> involves a range of coenzymes that are unique to these archaea, such as coenzyme M and methanofuran. Other organic compounds such as alcohols, acetic acid or formic acid are used as alternative electron acceptors by methanogens. These reactions are common in gut-dwelling archaea. Acetic acid is also broken down into methane and carbon dioxide directly, by acetotrophic archaea. These acetotrophs are archaea in the order Methanosarcinales, and are {{a major part of the}} communities of microorganisms that produce biogas.|$|E
5|$|One {{property}} {{unique to}} Archaea is the abundant use of ether-linked lipids in their cell membranes. Ether linkages are more chemically stable than the ester linkages found in Bacteria and Eukarya, {{which may be}} a contributing factor {{to the ability of}} many Archaea to survive in extreme environments that place heavy stress on cell membranes, such as extreme heat and salinity. Comparative analysis of archaeal genomes has also identified several molecular signatures in the form of conserved signature indels and signature proteins which are uniquely present in either all Archaea or different main groups within Archaea. Another unique feature of Archaea is that no other known organisms are capable of <b>methanogenesis</b> (the metabolic production of methane). Methanogenic Archaea play a pivotal role in ecosystems with organisms that derive energy from oxidation of methane, many of which are Bacteria, as they are often a major source of methane in such environments and can play a role as primary producers. Methanogens also {{play a critical role in}} the carbon cycle, breaking down organic carbon into methane, which is also a major greenhouse gas.|$|E

25|$|The {{four key}} stages of {{anaerobic}} digestion involve hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis and <b>methanogenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The cell used chemiosmosis {{to produce}} energy. It also reduced CO2 and {{oxidized}} H2 (<b>methanogenesis</b> or acetogenesis) via acetyl-thioesters.|$|E
25|$|The {{terminal}} {{stage of}} anaerobic digestion is the biological process of <b>methanogenesis.</b> Here, methanogens use the intermediate {{products of the}} preceding stages and convert them into methane, carbon dioxide, and water. These components make {{up the majority of}} the biogas emitted from the system. <b>Methanogenesis</b> is sensitive to both high and low pHs and occurs between pH 6.5 and pH 8. The remaining, indigestible material the microbes cannot use and any dead bacterial remains constitute the digestate.|$|E
25|$|The {{final step}} in the process is catalyzed by the enzyme Coenzyme-B sulfoethylthiotransferase. <b>Methanogenesis</b> is a form of {{anaerobic}} respiration used by organisms that occupy landfill, ruminants (e.g., cattle), and the guts of termites.|$|E
25|$|A {{chemical}} {{basis for}} the abiotic petroleum process is the serpentinization of peridotite, beginning with <b>methanogenesis</b> via hydrolysis of olivine into serpentine {{in the presence of}} carbon dioxide. Olivine, composed of Forsterite and Fayalite metamorphoses into serpentine, magnetite and silica by the following reactions, with silica from fayalite decomposition (reaction 1a) feeding into the forsterite reaction (1b).|$|E
25|$|James Lake {{presented}} a 2 primary kingdom arrangement (Parkaryotae + eukaryotes and eocytes + Karyotae) and suggested a 5 primary kingdom scheme (Eukaryota, Eocyta, Methanobacteria, Halobacteria, and Eubacteria) based on ribosomal structure and a 4 primary kingdom scheme (Eukaryota, Eocyta, Methanobacteria, and Photocyta), bacteria being classified according to 3 major biochemical innovations: photosynthesis (Photocyta), <b>methanogenesis</b> (Methanobacteria), and sulfur respiration (Eocyta). He has also discovered evidence that Gram-negative bacteria arose from a symbiosis between 2 Gram-positive bacteria.|$|E
25|$|The Arctic {{region is}} one of the many natural sources of the {{greenhouse}} gas methane. Global warming accelerates its release, due to both release of methane from existing stores, and from <b>methanogenesis</b> in rotting biomass. Large quantities of methane are stored in the Arctic in natural gas deposits, permafrost, and as undersea clathrates. Permafrost and clathrates degrade on warming, thus large releases of methane from these sources may arise as a result of global warming. Other sources of methane include submarine taliks, river transport, ice complex retreat, submarine permafrost and decaying gas hydrate deposits.|$|E
25|$|Anaerobic digesters can be {{designed}} and engineered to operate using {{a number of different}} configurations and can be categorized into batch vs. continuous process mode, mesophilic vs. thermophilic temperature conditions, high vs. low portion of solids, and single stage vs. multistage processes. More initial build money and a larger volume of the batch digester is needed to handle the same amount of waste as a continuous process digester. Higher heat energy is demanded in a thermophilic system compared to a mesophilic system and has a larger gas output capacity and higher methane gas content. For solids content, low will handle up to 15% solid content. Above this level is considered high solids content and can also be known as dry digestion. In a single stage process, one reactor houses the four anaerobic digestion steps. A multistage process utilizes two or more reactors for digestion to separate the <b>methanogenesis</b> and hydrolysis phases.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} routes for {{geological}} methane generation, organic (thermogenic), and inorganic (abiotic, meaning non-living). Thermally generated methane, {{is referred to as}} thermogenic, originating from deeper sedimentary strata. Thermogenic methane (CH4) formation occurs due to the break-up of organic matter, forced by elevated temperatures and pressures. This type of methane is considered to be the primary methane type in sedimentary basins, and from an economical perspective the most important source of natural gas. Thermogenic methane components are generally considered to be relic (from an earlier time). Generally, formation of thermogenic methane (at depth), can occur through organic matter break-up, or organic synthesis, both ways can involve microorganisms (<b>methanogenesis)</b> but may also occur inorganically. The involved anaerobic and aerobic processes can also consume methane, with and without microorganisms.The more important source of methane at depth (crystalline bedrock) is abiotic. Abiotic means that the methane formation took place involving inorganic compounds, without biological activity, magmatic or created at low temperatures and pressures through water-rock reactions.|$|E
500|$|Saturn's moon Enceladus, {{which seems}} similar in {{chemical}} makeup to comets, {{has often been}} regarded as a potential habitat for microbial life. Evidence of this possibility includes the satellite's salt-rich particles having an [...] "ocean-like" [...] composition that indicates most of Enceladus's expelled ice comes from the evaporation of liquid salt water. A 2015 flyby by Cassini through a plume on Enceladus found most of the ingredients to sustain life forms that live by <b>methanogenesis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Methane {{is a major}} {{component}} of natural gas. Geosphere methane is intriguing for the large input of microbial <b>methanogenesis.</b> This process exhibits a strong isotope effect, resulting in greater D-depletion in methane relative to other hydrocarbons. δD ranges from -275‰ to -100‰ in thermogenic methane, and from -400‰ to -150‰ in microbial methane. Also, methane formed by marine methanogens is generally enriched in D relative to methane from freshwater methanogens. δD of methane has been plotted together with other geochemical tools(like δ13C, gas wetness) to categorize and identify natural gas. A δD-δ13C diagram (sometimes referred to as CD diagram, Whiticar diagram, or Schoell diagram [...] ) is widely used to place methane in one of the three distinct groups: thermogenic methane that is higher in both δ13C and δD; marine microbial methane that is more depleted in 13C and freshwater microbial methane that is more depleted in D. Hydrogenotrophic <b>methanogenesis</b> produces less D-depleted methane relative to acetoclastic <b>methanogenesis.</b> The location where the organism lives and substrate concentration also affect isotopic composition: rumen <b>methanogenesis,</b> which occurs in a more closed system and with higher partial pressures of hydrogen, exhibits a greater fractionation (-300 to -400‰) than wetland <b>methanogenesis</b> (-250 to -170‰).|$|E

2500|$|Methanothermus, Methanosarcina, Methanosaeta and Methanopyrus. [...] The {{biochemistry}} of <b>methanogenesis</b> {{is unique}} in nature in its use {{of a number of}} unusual cofactors to sequentially reduce methanogenic substrates to methane, such as coenzyme M and methanofuran. [...] These cofactors are responsible (among other things) {{for the establishment of a}} proton gradient across the outer membrane thereby driving ATP synthesis. [...] Several types of <b>methanogenesis</b> occur, differing in the starting compounds oxidized. [...] Some methanogens reduce carbon dioxide (...) to methane (...) using electrons (most often) from hydrogen gas (...) [...] chemolithoautotrophically. [...] These methanogens can often be found in environments containing fermentative organisms. [...] The tight association of methanogens and fermentative bacteria can be considered to be syntrophic (see below) because the methanogens, which rely on the fermentors for hydrogen, relieve feedback inhibition of the fermentors by the build-up of excess hydrogen that would otherwise inhibit their growth. [...] This type of syntrophic relationship is specifically known as interspecies hydrogen transfer. [...] A second group of methanogens use methanol (...) as a substrate for <b>methanogenesis.</b> These are chemoorganotrophic, but still autotrophic in using [...] as only carbon source. [...] The biochemistry of this process is quite different from that of the carbon dioxide-reducing methanogens. [...] Lastly, a third group of methanogens produce both methane and carbon dioxide from acetate (...) with the acetate being split between the two carbons. These acetate-cleaving organisms are the only chemoorganoheterotrophic methanogens. [...] All autotrophic methanogens use a variation of the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway to fix [...] and obtain cellular carbon.|$|E
2500|$|Methane {{is created}} near the Earth's surface, {{primarily}} by microorganisms {{by the process}} of <b>methanogenesis.</b> It is carried into the stratosphere by rising air in the tropics. Uncontrolled build-up of methane in the atmosphere is naturally checked– [...] although human influence can upset this natural regulation– [...] by methane's reaction with hydroxyl radicals formed from singlet oxygen atoms and with water vapor. It has a net lifetime of about 10 years, and is primarily removed by conversion to carbon dioxide and water.|$|E
2500|$|Acetogenesis {{is a type}} of {{microbial}} metabolism that uses hydrogen (...) as an electron donor and carbon dioxide (...) as an electron acceptor to produce acetate, the same electron donors and acceptors used in <b>methanogenesis</b> (see above). [...] Bacteria that can autotrophically synthesize acetate are called homoacetogens. [...] Carbon dioxide reduction in all homoacetogens occurs by the acetyl-CoA pathway. [...] This pathway is also used for carbon fixation by autotrophic sulfate-reducing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. [...] Often homoacetogens can also be fermentative, using the hydrogen and carbon dioxide produced as a result of fermentation to produce acetate, which is secreted as an end product.|$|E
2500|$|However, serpentinite {{synthesis}} and spinel cracking reactions require {{hydrothermal alteration}} of pristine peridotite-dunite, {{which is a}} finite process intrinsically related to metamorphism, and further, requires significant addition of water. Serpentinite is unstable at mantle temperatures and is readily dehydrated to granulite, amphibolite, talcschist and even eclogite. This suggests that <b>methanogenesis</b> {{in the presence of}} serpentinites is restricted in space and time to mid-ocean ridges and upper levels of subduction zones. [...] However, water has been found as deep as , so water-based reactions are dependent upon the local conditions. Oil being created by this process in intracratonic regions is limited by the materials and temperature.|$|E
2500|$|As the microoganisms anaerobically digest the biomass {{and convert}} {{it into a}} mixture of {{carboxylic}} acids, the pH must be controlled. This {{is done by the}} addition of a buffering agent (e.g., ammonium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate), thus yielding a mixture of carboxylate salts. <b>Methanogenesis,</b> being the natural final stage of anaerobic digestion, is inhibited by the presence of the ammonium ions or by the addition of an inhibitor (e.g., iodoform). [...] The resulting fermentation broth contains the produced carboxylate salts that must be dewatered. This is achieved efficiently by vapor-compression evaporation. Further chemical refining of the dewatered fermentation broth may then take place depending on the final chemical or biofuel product desired.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{a debate}} about {{whether there was a}} large enough amount of methane hydrate to be a major carbon source; a recent paper {{proposed}} that was the case. The present-day global methane hydrate reserve is poorly constrained, but is mostly considered to be between 2,000 and 10,000 Gt. However, because the global ocean bottom temperatures were ~6°C higher than today, which implies a much smaller volume of sediment hosting gas hydrate than today, the global amount of hydrate before the PETM has been thought to be much less than present-day estimates. in a 2006 study, scientists regarded the source of carbon for the PETM to be a mystery. [...] A 2011 study, using numerical simulations suggests that enhanced organic carbon sedimentation and <b>methanogenesis</b> could have compensated for the smaller volume of hydrate stability.|$|E
2500|$|Recent {{advances}} in analytical chemistry have enabled high-precision measurements of multiply substituted isotopologues (or 'clumped isotopologues') like 13CH3D. This {{emerge as a}} novel tool for studying methane formation. This proxy {{is based on the}} abundance of clumped isotopologues of methane, which should be enriched compared to the stochastic distribution at thermodynamic equilibrium because the reduced zero-point energy for heavy-heavy isotope bonding is more than twice the reduced zero-point energy of heavy-light isotope bonding. The extent of enrichment decreases with increasing temperature, as higher entropy tends to randomize isotope distribution. [...] Stolper et al. established this temperature calibration using laboratory equilibrated methane and field methane from known formation temperature, and applied this to several gas reservoirs to study natural gas formation and mixing. Wang et al. also reported strong non-equilibrium isotope effect in methane clumped isotopes from lab-cultured methanogens and field samples. These methane samples have relatively low abundance of clumped isotopologues, sometimes even lower than the stochastic distribution. This indicates that there are irreversible steps in enzymatic reactions during <b>methanogenesis</b> that fractionation against clumped isotopologues to create the depleted signal. Isotope clumping in methane has proven a robust proxy, and scientists are now moving towards higher-order alkane molecules like ethane for further work.|$|E
2500|$|Syntrophy, in {{the context}} of {{microbial}} metabolism, refers to the pairing of multiple species to achieve a chemical reaction that, on its own, would be energetically unfavorable. [...] The best studied example of this process is the oxidation of fermentative end products (such as acetate, ethanol and butyrate) by organisms such as Syntrophomonas. [...] Alone, the oxidation of butyrate to acetate and hydrogen gas is energetically unfavorable. [...] However, when a hydrogenotrophic (hydrogen-using) methanogen is present the use of the hydrogen gas will significantly lower the concentration of hydrogen (down to 10−5 atm) and thereby shift the equilibrium of the butyrate oxidation reaction under standard conditions (ΔGº’) to non-standard conditions (ΔG’). Because the concentration of one product is lowered, the reaction is [...] "pulled" [...] towards the products and shifted towards net energetically favorable conditions (for butyrate oxidation: ΔGº’= +48.2 kJ/mol, but ΔG' = -8.9 kJ/mol at 10−5 atm hydrogen and even lower if also the initially produced acetate is further metabolized by methanogens). Conversely, the available free energy from <b>methanogenesis</b> is lowered from ΔGº’= -131 kJ/mol under standard conditions to ΔG' = -17 kJ/mol at 10−5 atm hydrogen. This is an example of intraspecies hydrogen transfer. [...] In this way, low energy-yielding carbon sources can be used by a consortium of organisms to achieve further degradation and eventual mineralization of these compounds.
