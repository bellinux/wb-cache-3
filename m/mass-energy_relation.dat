While his results are mathematically equivalent to those of Lorentz and Poincaré, it was Einstein who showed that the Lorentz transformations are {{not the result of}} interactions between matter and aether, but rather concern the nature of space and time itself. Einstein performed his analyses in terms of kinematics (the study of moving bodies without reference to forces) rather than dynamics. He obtained all of his results by recognizing that the entire theory can be built upon two postulates: The principle of relativity and the principle of the constancy of light speed. In addition, Einstein in 1905 superseded previous attempts of an electromagnetic <b>mass-energy</b> <b>relation</b> by introducing the general equivalence of mass and energy, which was instrumental for his subsequent formulation of the equivalence principle in 1907, which declares the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass. By using the mass-energy equivalence, Einstein showed, in addition, that the gravitational mass of a body is proportional to its energy content, which was one of early results in developing general relativity. While it would appear that he did not at first think geometrically about spacetime, in the further development of general relativity Einstein fully incorporated the spacetime formalism.|$|E

Therefore, in addition to Lorentz factor, the equivalence principle is derived directly from the resulting discrete symmetry.

40|$|In this paper, we {{establish}} {{a theory of}} Special Relativity valid for the entire speed range without the assumption of constant speed of light. Two particles species are defined, one species of particles have rest frames with rest mass, and another species of particles do not have rest frame and can not define rest mass. We prove that for the particles which have rest frames, the Galilean transformation is the only linear transformation of space-time that allows infinite speed of particle motion. Hence without any assumption, an upper bound of speed is required for all non-Galilean linear transformations. We then present a novel derivation of the mass-velocity and the <b>mass-energy</b> <b>relations</b> {{in the framework of}} relativistic dynamics, which is solely based on the principle of relativity and basic definitions of relativistic momentum and energy. The generalized Lorentz transformation is then determined. The new relativistic formulas are not related directly to the speed of light c, but are replaced by a Relativity Constant C_R which is an universal speed constant of the Nature introduced in relativistic dynamics. Particles having rest mass are called tardyons moving slower than C_R. Particles having neither rest frames nor rest mass are called tachyons moving faster than C_R, and with the real mass-velocity relation m=|p⃗_∞ |(v^ 2 -C_R^ 2) ^- 1 / 2 where p⃗_∞ is the finite momentum of tachyon at infinite speed. Moreover, the particles with constant-speed C_R, also having neither rest frames nor rest mass, are called constons. For all particles, p^ 2 =p⃗^ 2 -(E^ 2 /C_R^ 2) remains invariant under transformation between inertia frames. The invariant reads p^ 2 =-m_ 0 ^ 2 C_R^ 2 0 for tachyons, respectively.

5000|$|..... more {{generally}} {{the reason he}} Hasenöhrl achieved an incorrect result on both occasions is {{that he wants to}} rigorously equate the work performed to kinetic energy, as the work-energy theorem demands. Unfortunately, he does not know how to properly compute the energy.

Let us end by saying that Fritz Hasenöhrl attempted a legitimate thought experiment and tackled it with the tools available at the time.

The preponderance of hydrogen in the Sun was confirmed in 1925 by Cecilia Payne using the ionization theory developed by Meghnad Saha, an Indian physicist. The theoretical concept of fusion was developed in the 1930s by the astrophysicists Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and Hans Bethe. Hans Bethe calculated the details of the two main energy-producing nuclear reactions that power the Sun. In 1957, Margaret Burbidge, Geoffrey Burbidge, William Fowler and Fred Hoyle showed that most of the elements in the universe have been synthesized by nuclear reactions inside stars, some like the Sun.|$|R

Through this general scheme we have accomplished a basic task of the unification of the classical- and the quantum- mechanics, both in terms of the deduction of the latter from the former, and the convergence of the latter into the former at high velocities. Through completing the task, we unfold the origins of a series of phenomena including the electromagnetic waves, the electromagnetic radiation and absorption, atomic and thermal excitations, the inertial mass, the Schrodinger's wavefunction and de Broglie wave, the Heisenberg's uncertainty relation, the de Broglie relations, the simultaneous existence of electron and positron or generally of particles and their anti-particles, the (rest) <b>mass-energy</b> equivalence <b>relation,</b> etc. The general scheme facilitates also a Theory of Relative Motion which we present in a separate paper, II; a series of followed studies are planned.

5000|$|The basic {{tenets of}} nuclear {{astrophysics}} are that only isotopes of {{hydrogen and helium}} (and traces of lithium, beryllium, and boron) can be formed in a homogeneous big bang model (see big bang nucleosynthesis), and all other elements are formed in stars. The conversion of nuclear mass to radiative energy (by merit of Einstein's famous <b>mass-energy</b> <b>relation</b> in relativity) {{is the source of}} energy which allows stars to shine for up to billions of years. Many notable physicists of the 19th century, such as Mayer, Waterson, von Helmholtz, and Lord Kelvin, postulated that the Sun radiates thermal energy based on converting gravitational potential energy into heat. The lifetime of the Sun under such a model can be calculated relatively easily using the virial theorem, yielding around 19 million years, an age that was not consistent with the interpretation of geological records or the then recently proposed theory of biological evolution. A back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates that if the Sun consisted entirely of a fossil fuel like coal, a source of energy familiar to many people, considering the rate of thermal energy emission, then the Sun would have a lifetime of merely four or five thousand years, which is not even consistent with records of human civilization. The now discredited hypothesis that gravitational contraction is the Sun's primary source of energy was, however, reasonable before the advent of modern physics; radioactivity itself was not discovered by Becquerel until 1895 [...] Besides the prerequisite knowledge of the atomic nucleus, a proper understanding of stellar energy is not possible without the theories of relativity and quantum mechanics.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: After {{recalling that}} Einstein's <b>mass-energy</b> <b>relation</b> is {{closely linked to}} the laws of thermodynamics- a {{proposition}} that has been presented in a previous article- the aim of this paper is an extension of this link to Newton's laws of gravitation. Arguments are given showing that the law of the evolution of systems, usually described as an increase in entropy, can be more generally understood as an increase in energy and a correlative decrease in mass, according to the principle of relativity. As it is derived exclusively from the macroscopic approach of Physics, the suggested theory offers the advantage- already present in Einstein's relation, Newton's laws and the classical laws of thermodynamics- of a great mathematical simplicity.

40|$|In the wave-{{particle}} duality, a {{free particle}} {{can be considered}} as a wave packet. Is there a wave property that corresponds to the rest mass of the particle? This is an interesting question that has not been extensively explored before. We suggest that this problem may be approached by treating the rest mass on the same footing as energy and momentum. Here we demonstrate that, by assuming that the matter wave of a particle behaves like a photon, one could derive the <b>mass-energy</b> <b>relation</b> from the solution of a simplified wave equation. This solution suggests that the rest mass of a particle is associated with a "transverse wave number", which characterizes the radial variation of the wave function in the transverse plane. This finding has several appealing features. For example, it shows a consistent geometrical relationship between mass, energy and momentum in both the wave and particle perspectives. Also, it predicts that a massless particle must travel at the constant speed of light. Furthermore, from a philosophical point of view, this model suggests that the <b>mass-energy</b> <b>relation</b> attributed to the special theory of relativity may have a root in the wave-particle duality.
