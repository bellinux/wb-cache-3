5|$|With the {{departure}} of Portuguese professionals and tradesmen, the new country had no senior workforce to <b>maintain</b> <b>its</b> infrastructure, and economic collapse loomed. Privileged commercial links were established with several communist countries by the FRELIMO regime {{at the expense of}} NATO, which rapidly lost influence in the region.|$|E
5|$|A brief {{fashion for}} men wearing snood-scarf neckwarmers ended in 2011 when the IFAB banned them as {{potentially}} dangerous. A ban on women wearing the hijab {{was introduced by}} the IFAB in 2007, but lifted in 2012 after pressure from Prince Ali of Jordan. In keeping with French views, the French Football Federation said it would <b>maintain</b> <b>its</b> ban.|$|E

5|$|An anniversary {{service was}} held in Holy Trinity Church Leverstock Green on Sunday, 10 December 2006, at which the Bishop of St Albans spoke, calling again for a full public inquiry, for assurances that the local {{hospital}} would <b>maintain</b> <b>its</b> accident and emergency department, and for the community to continue to build on good relationships formed because of the blast.|$|E
5|$|At {{the close}} of the third season, The Wire was still {{struggling}} to <b>maintain</b> <b>its</b> ratings and the show faced possible cancellation. Creator David Simon blamed the show's low ratings in part on its competition against Desperate Housewives and worried that expectations for HBO dramas had changed following the success of The Sopranos.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War Clarke was promoted to lieutenant colonel and began working on intelligence tasks. He worked with Wavell in the Middle East to research possible Allied supply lines, undertook two trips to Norway (in an effort to <b>maintain</b> <b>its</b> neutrality), and conducted secret missions in Calais and Ireland.|$|E

5|$|Buoyancy: The actual mass of {{the human}} brain is about 1400–1500 grams; however, the net weight of the brain {{suspended}} in the CSF is equivalent to a mass of 25-50 grams. The brain therefore exists in neutral buoyancy, which allows the brain to <b>maintain</b> <b>its</b> density without being impaired by its own weight, which would cut off blood supply and kill neurons in the lower sections without CSF.|$|E
5|$|Eline {{was unusual}} in its track after {{striking}} Madagascar. Most storms in the Mozambique Channel {{turn to the}} south, ultimately missing land; however, upon landfall, Eline became one of 5% of recorded cyclones to strike southern Africa. In addition, favorable conditions allowed the storm to <b>maintain</b> <b>its</b> identity over land. Overall, Cyclone LeonEline traveled over 11,000km (6,800mi) during its 29day duration.|$|E
5|$|Harvard {{refused to}} attend the rules conference {{organized}} by the other schools and continued to play under its own code. While Harvard's decision to <b>maintain</b> <b>its</b> code made it {{hard for them to}} schedule games against other American universities, it agreed to play McGill University, from Montreal, in a two-game series in 1874. Harvard won the first game, in which its rules were used, 3–0. The second game, which was played under rugby regulations, did not have a winner as neither team managed to score.|$|E

5|$|In 1975, the United States was {{completing}} a retreat from Vietnam. A staunchly anti-communist Indonesia was {{considered by the}} United States to be an essential counterweight, and friendly relations with the Indonesian government were considered {{more important than a}} decolonisation process in East Timor. The United States also wanted to <b>maintain</b> <b>its</b> access to deep water straits running through Indonesia for undetectable submarine passage between the Indian and Pacific oceans.|$|E
5|$|Lalic {{thinks the}} {{strategies}} in which Black gives up the bishop pair (by exchanging its Bb4 for the Nd2) for nothing are a mistake. He {{does not like}} the strategy to retreat the Bb4 in d6 either, because they are too drawish. He recommends the strategy to retreat the bishop in c5, and <b>maintain</b> <b>its</b> position there {{with the help of}} the a7–a5 pawn advance.|$|E
5|$|River otters swim by quadrupedal paddling, forelimb paddling, {{alternate}} hind-limb paddling, simultaneous hind-limb paddling, or {{body and}} tail dorsoventral undulation. The tail, which is stout and larger in surface area than the limbs, {{is used for}} stability while swimming and for short bursts of rapid propulsion. While swimming at the surface, the dorsal portion of the river otter's head, including nostrils, ears, and eyes, is exposed above water. It must remain in motion to <b>maintain</b> <b>its</b> position at the surface.|$|E

5|$|The Council of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a {{politically}} independent think tank dedicated to {{defence and security}} issues, elected Dannatt as the Institute's Chairman in June 2009. He took up the appointment on 1 September 2009, but resigned in October the same year after the announcement {{that he was to}} become an adviser to David Cameron, believing that his resignation was necessary for RUSI to <b>maintain</b> <b>its</b> political neutrality. He was eventually succeeded by former Defence Secretary John Hutton, Baron Hutton of Furness.|$|E
5|$|The Germans also {{suffered}} heavily; the 47th Panzer Corps had committed its last reserves into the battle and could hardly afford to <b>maintain</b> <b>its</b> defensive line, while the 47th Volksgrenadier Division had suffered over 4,300 casualties during {{the fighting and}} the 340th Division had lost nearly 2,000 soldiers. This latter division {{was replaced by the}} 363rd Volksgrenadier and 10th SS Panzer Divisions, as the 340th was pulled out in order to be rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|The new castle needed {{constant}} {{investment to}} <b>maintain</b> <b>its</b> quality {{as a military}} fortification. Winter floods in 1315–16 damaged the soil {{at the base of}} the motte, requiring immediate repairs. Around 1358–60, the heavy stone keep again suffered from subsidence and the south-eastern lobe cracked from top to bottom. Royal officials recommended that the keep be completely rebuilt, but, instead, the lobe was repaired at a cost of £200.|$|E

5|$|Three of Europe's major {{languages}} are official in Switzerland. Swiss culture is characterised by diversity, which {{is reflected in}} a wide range of traditional customs. A region may be in some ways strongly culturally connected to the neighbouring country that shares its language, the country itself being rooted in western European culture. The linguistically isolated Romansh culture in Graubünden in eastern Switzerland constitutes an exception, it survives only in the upper valleys of the Rhine and the Inn and strives to <b>maintain</b> <b>its</b> rare linguistic tradition.|$|E
5|$|To be most {{effective}} at controlling a pest, a biological control agent requires a colonizing ability which allows it {{to keep pace with}} changes to the habitat in space and time. Control is greatest if the agent has temporal persistence, so that it can <b>maintain</b> <b>its</b> population even in the temporary absence of the target species, and if it is an opportunistic forager, enabling it to rapidly exploit a pest population.|$|E
