50|$|Another {{benefit is}} the {{increase}} in the response rate and response time. Because personalization catches the attention of the consumer, the response rate of a mail campaign increases. Personalization also increases the response time, because the <b>mailed</b> <b>piece</b> has an effect on the consumer. This effect causes the consumer to respond quicker. A <b>mailed</b> <b>piece</b> that is not eye-catching may be put down and forgotten until a later time, so it may take weeks before a response is received.|$|R

We used a convolutional locator network with four outputs, each trained to nd a di erent corner of the address block. A simple set of rules was used to generate ABL candidates from the network output. The system performs very well: when allowed ve guesses, the network will tightly bound the address delivery information in 98. 2 % of the cases. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{organized}} as follows. Section 2 briefly describes several approaches to address block location {{reported in the}} literature. Section 3 introduces the well-known multichannel filtering method and, in particular, Gabor filters for texture-based segmentation. In Section 4, we justify {{that the problem of}} address block location {{can be viewed as a}} "texture segmentation" problem. Section 5 gives experimental results which demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. Finally, Section 6 presents a summary of our work and few concluding remarks. 2 Approaches to Address Block Location Several researchers have dealt with the problem of locating address blocks in images of <b>mail</b> <b>pieces</b> [2, 10, 13, 14]. Expert systems utilizing AI techniques have been built for locating address blocks in the presence of other text and graphic information on the face of the <b>mail</b> <b>piece.</b> Another popular approach is to extract simple geometric features which characterize address blocks. This section contains a brief summary of these approaches reported in the literature. 2. 1 An Expert Systems Approach An expert system for automatic sorting of <b>mail</b> <b>pieces</b> has been developed by Wang et al [10, 13]. In this scheme, the address blocks are located by the Address Block Location Subsystem (ABLS). The system is capable of using multispectral images (gray scale, color, infrared, or color under ultraviolet illumination). The ABLS consists of six major components: (i) Mail statistical database (MSD) : contains statistics of the geometric features of address labels on various mail items. This database has been generated after 3 careful analysis of a large number of <b>mail</b> <b>pieces.</b> (ii) Tool box: contains image processing tools for thresholding, segmentation, labeling connected components, discrimina [...] ...|$|R

50|$|An Addressograph {{system of}} the 1960s was {{essentially}} a Graphotype debossing machine for preparing address plates, a cassette-style plate feeder, a heavy-duty, rapidly moving inked ribbon, a platten for hand-feeding the <b>mail</b> <b>piece,</b> and a foot pedal for stamping the address. The individual steel address plates were inserted into card-sized frames which {{had a series of}} slots along the top where colored metal flags could also be inserted for sorting purposes. The plate assemblies were placed in steel cassettes resembling library card catalogue drawers, which were manually inserted into the machine. At the press of the foot pedal the plate assemblies were swapped in sequence in a similar fashion to a slide projector, placing an impression of the raised type onto the <b>mail</b> <b>piece.</b>|$|R

Late in the campaign, Fuse organized a protest in Bellevue against what it called negative <b>mail</b> <b>pieces</b> against Balducci and Stokes.

The origin of the technical approach for this output module was a concept for an Advanced Letter Sorter with a multilevel transporter, that required a horizontal output stacker. One output module has to reach up to four different levels of the transporter so that the vertical space required by the output stacker had to be minimized. Considering the heterogeneous composition of manual letter mail and its differing physical characteristics, a nearly form-locking transfer of <b>mail</b> <b>pieces</b> between transporter carriers and stack was favoured. As a consequence, the transmission had to be effected with minimal friction influences. This paper describes the functional principle, the main components of the output module, and the results and parame ters of several tests...|$|R
