40|$|Abstract: After the 1995 Kobe earthquake, {{countermeasures}} against earthquakes got {{higher priority}} than before. As one of such earthquake countermeasures, Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd. introduced an earthquake monitoring and rapid damage assessment system called SUPREME. This {{system has been}} under operation since 2001.

The <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> stops <b>gas</b> supply if earthquake motion exceeds a certain level. SUPREME has a subsystem to estimate the number of <b>gas</b> <b>meters</b> which stop <b>gas</b> supply because of an earthquake. However, the accuracy of estimation by this subsystem is not good because the characteristics of gas supply shutoff by the intelligent <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> are not so clear. In this study, to improve the accuracy of estimation, the characteristics of gas supply shutoff by the intelligent <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> are investigated based on shaking table tests and the questionnaire survey among employees of Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Two {{different}} methods for measuring biogas production were used, <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> and gasbags.
