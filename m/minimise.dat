5|$|A {{problem with}} early bombsights {{was that they}} could only correct {{for the effects of}} the wind in a simple way and {{required}} the bomber to fly directly up- or down-wind from the target, to <b>minimise</b> the complexity of the required calculations.

The two criteria of <b>minimising</b> the maximum utilisation of the machines or rental cost of machines and <b>minimising</b> the maximum makespan are one of the combinations of our objective function reflecting the performance measure.

Our proposed single lag autocorrelation minimisation (SLAM) algorithm has very low complexity. We also constrain the autocorrelation minimisation with a novel stopping criterion so that the shortening signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) of the effective channel is not <b>minimised</b> by the autocorrelation minimisation.
