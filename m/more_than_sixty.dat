In the 1950s and early 1960s, he was less in demand by the major labels, and although he made a substantial number of discs for Decca, he recorded mostly for smaller labels, chiefly Pye Nixa. His last period, from the mid-1960s, sometimes referred to as his Indian Summer, was once again with HMV.

Eliza Violet Gist married Francis Preston Blair on July 21, 1812, just prior to the expiration of Scott's term as governor. The governor opined that Blair, who was slightly built, stoop-shouldered, and suffering from tuberculosis, would leave Eliza a widow within six months.

By November 1868 Jacobus was advertising his first album, titled Sumatra's Westkust (Sumatra's West Coast). Bound in Moroccan leather, the album contained <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>sixty</b> landscapes of Padang and surrounding cities (including Padang Panjang and Fort de Kock).

5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1927, Messiaen joined Dupré's organ course. Dupré later wrote that Messiaen, having never seen an organ console, sat quietly for an hour while Dupré {{explained}} and demonstrated the instrument, and then came back a week later to play Johann Sebastian Bach's Fantasia in C minor to an impressive standard. From 1929, Messiaen regularly deputised at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris, for the organist Charles Quef, who was ill at the time. The post became vacant in 1931 when Quef died, and Dupré, Charles Tournemire and Widor among others supported Messiaen's candidacy. His formal application included a letter of recommendation from Widor. The appointment was confirmed in 1931, and he remained the organist at the church for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>sixty</b> years. He also assumed a post at the Schola Cantorum de Paris in the early 1930s. In 1932, he composed the Apparition de l'église éternelle for organ.|$|E
5|$|Sir Ralph David Richardson (19 December 1902– 10 October 1983) was an English actor who, {{along with}} his contemporaries John Gielgud and Laurence Olivier, {{dominated}} the British stage of the mid-20th century. He worked in films throughout most of his career, and played <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>sixty</b> cinema roles. From an artistic but not theatrical background, Richardson had had no thought of a stage career until a production of Hamlet in Brighton inspired him to become an actor. He learned his craft in the 1920s with a touring company and later the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. In 1931 he joined the Old Vic, playing mostly Shakespearean roles. He led the company the following season, succeeding Gielgud, who had taught him much about stage technique. After he left the company, a series of leading roles took him to stardom in the West End and on Broadway.|$|E

5000|$|Standard byoyomi: After {{the main}} time is depleted, a player {{has a certain}} number of time periods (typically around thirty seconds). After each move, the number of {{full-time}} periods that the player took (often zero) is subtracted. For example, if a player has three thirty-second time periods and takes thirty or <b>more</b> (but less <b>than</b> <b>sixty)</b> seconds to make a move, they lose one time period. With 60-89 seconds, they lose two time periods, and so on. If, however, they take less than thirty seconds, the timer simply resets without subtracting any periods. Using up the last period means that the player has lost on time.|$|R

5|$|The Act also {{extended}} the franchise. In county constituencies, {{in addition to}} forty-shilling freeholders, franchise rights were extended to owners of land in copyhold worth £10 and holders of long-term leases (<b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>sixty</b> years) on land worth £10 and holders of medium-term leases (between twenty and sixty years) on land worth £50 and to tenants-at-will paying an annual rent of £50. In borough constituencies all male householders living in properties worth at least £10 a year were given {{the right to vote}} – a measure which introduced to all boroughs a standardised form of franchise for the first time. Existing borough electors retained a lifetime right to vote, however they had qualified, provided they were resident in the boroughs in which they were electors. In those boroughs which had freemen electors, voting rights were to be enjoyed by future freemen as well provided their freemanship was acquired through birth or apprenticeship and they too were resident.|$|E

The split paling cladding was replaced with weatherboards in the 1900s. The roof was replaced with iron, probably in 1914 when the brick church was also re-roofed in iron. The interior paling lining of the old wooden church was covered with pine sheeting in the late 1930s. This building {{has been used as a}} church for seven years, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>sixty</b> years as a meeting room and community centre and more than seventy years as a day and Sunday school. After the school moved to a new building in 1929 the old building remained in use as a Sunday school.|$|E
5|$|The park {{is an area}} of rich highveld and montane {{grassland}} flora. It has <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>sixty</b> grass {{species and}} a large variety of bulbs and herbs. Each of these species has its own flowering time, meaning that veld flowers can be seen throughout the summer. The park also has Afromontane forests and high-altitude Austro-Afro alpine grassland, which is scarce in South Africa. The ouhout (Leucosidea sericea), an evergreen species, is the most common tree in the park. Ouhout is a favourite habitat of beetles and 117 species occur on these trees in the park. The Lombardi poplars and weeping willows in the park are introduced species, but are kept because of their cultural and historic connection with the eastern Free State. Other exotic species in the park, for example wattle and bluegum, are systematically eradicated.|$|E
50|$|Assheton's {{scheme for}} {{providing}} annuities for the 'widows {{of the clergy}} and others' was the earliest attempt in England {{on a large scale}} in the direction of modern life insurance. His plan was offered unsuccessfully to the Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy, and to the Bank of England, but was eventually adopted by the Mercers' Company in 1698. Its failure was due to poor knowledge of vital statistics. Something like a scale was formed. Married men under thirty were allowed to subscribe just £100; under forty they might not subscribe <b>more</b> <b>than</b> £500; under <b>sixty</b> they were limited to £300.|$|R
40|$|Data on {{pacemaker}} implantation {{were obtained from}} the Medical Device Implant Supplement to the 1988 National Health Interview Survey, a nationally representative, population-based survey of 47, 485 households (122, 310 persons). The survey yielded an estimate of 456, 482 noninstitutionalized adults with pacemakers (prevalence, 2. 6 per 1, 000). Prevalence rose significantly with age, from 0. 4 per 1, 000 among persons ages 18 - 64 to 26 per 1, 000 among those ages 75 or older. Age-adjusted prevalence in males was 1. 5 times that in females, and in whites 1. 6 times that in nonwhites, although these differences were of borderline statistical significance. Prevalence did not vary significantly by region of residence, educational level, or income, but was significantly increased (<b>more</b> <b>than</b> threefold) in those reporting any activity limitation compared with those with no limitation. Fifteen percent of pacemakers in use were replacements; about one-fifth of these had been replaced <b>more</b> <b>than</b> twice. <b>Sixty</b> percent of previous pacemakers had been in place for at least 5 years.

5|$|On Hannibal, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>sixty</b> men {{had been}} killed and Captain Ferris ordered the {{survivors}} below decks to escape {{the worst of the}} fire as the combined guns of the French and Spanish forces turned on the last remaining target, starting several fires. By 14:00, seeing that continued resistance was futile, he had ordered the colours struck, and the Hannibals ensign came down. French and Spanish soldiers then stormed the ship, and Hannibals surgeon later reported that a number of wounded men were trampled to death as the boarding parties sought to extinguish the fires. It has not been established whether what followed was a misunderstanding aboard Hannibal or a deliberate ploy by the French, but Hannibals ensign was then rehoisted upside down, a recognised international signal of distress. Captain Dundas, who had watched the entire battle from Gibraltar, believed on seeing the flag that it meant that Ferris was still holding out on Hannibal and requesting either support to salvage his battered ship or for it to be evacuated before surrendering. Boats were sent from Gibraltar with carpenters from the dockyards there to effect repairs on Hannibal and Dundas took HMS Calpe back into the bay to provide assistance, coming under heavy fire before withdrawing when his error was realised, although not before several of the boats had been seized by the French as their crews boarded Hannibal.|$|E
5|$|RKO {{released}} a limited slate of twelve features {{in its first}} year; in 1930, that figure more than doubled to twenty-nine. Originally organized as the distinct business entities RKO Productions Inc. and RKO Distributing Corp., by July the studio was making a transition to the new, unified RKO Radio Pictures Inc. Encouraged by Rio Ritas success, RKO produced several costly musicals incorporating Technicolor sequences, among them Dixiana and Hit the Deck, both scripted and directed, like Rio Rita, by Luther Reed. Following {{the example of the}} other major studios, RKO had planned to create its own musical revue, Radio Revels. Promoted as the studio's most extravagant production to date, it was to be photographed entirely in Technicolor. The project was abandoned, however, as the public's taste for musicals temporarily subsided. From a total of <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>sixty</b> Hollywood musicals in 1929 and over eighty the following year, the number dropped to eleven in 1931. RKO was left in a bind: it still had a contract with Technicolor to produce two more features with its system. Complicating matters, audiences had come to associate color with the momentarily out-of-favor musical genre due to a glut of such productions from the major Hollywood studios. Fulfilling its obligations, RKO produced two all-Technicolor pictures, The Runaround and Fanny Foley Herself (both 1931), containing no musical sequences. Neither was a success.|$|E

When both units moved away from their rendezvous points neither had <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>sixty</b> percent of their strength, although individual airborne troops and small groups would join the battalions throughout the day. Both of the battalions had been tasked with securing the area around DZ N and the two bridges captured by the coup-de-main force, a task which was made much more difficult by being scattered throughout the area. The 12th Parachute Battalion's mission was to secure the village of Le Bas de Ranville, which it did so by 04:00. The 13th Parachute Battalion was to capture the town of Ranville, which it achieved {{around the same time}} albeit against heavier resistance than that encountered by the other battalion. One company from 13th Parachute Battalion was detailed to remain at the battalion drop-zone in order to provide protection for a company of sappers. The latter were to demolish the poles and explosives that were present in the area, so that the 6th Airborne Division headquarters could land safely. The two battalions held their respective areas until relieved by ground forces advancing from the beaches. The 12th Parachute Battalion was bombarded with heavy mortar and artillery fire, and repelled two German counter-attacks by the 125th Panzer Grenadier Regiment; the first was defeated after destroying a tank and taking a number of prisoners, and the second was repulsed {{with the help of an}} air-landed anti-tank battery which had recently arrived.|$|E
