5000|$|Minipreparation of plasmid DNA is a rapid, {{small-scale}} {{isolation of}} plasmid DNA from bacteria. It {{is based on}} the alkaline lysis method. The extracted plasmid DNA resulting from performing a <b>miniprep</b> is itself often called a [...] "miniprep".Minipreps are used in the process of molecular cloning to analyze bacterial clones. A typical plasmid DNA yield of a <b>miniprep</b> is 50 to 100 µg depending on the cell strain.Miniprep of large number of plasmids can also be done conveniently by on filter paper lysing, the elution of the filter paper that contains plasmid can be directly sequenced to produce more than 700 bp high quality sequencing data with CE sequencing.|$|E
50|$|In the latter, {{much larger}} volumes of {{bacterial}} suspension are grown {{from which a}} maxi-prep can be performed. In essence, this is a scaled-up <b>miniprep</b> followed by additional purification. This results in relatively large amounts (several hundreds micrograms) of very pure plasmid DNA.|$|E
50|$|The plasmid {{is often}} {{transformed}} into a bacterium like E. coli. Ideally when the bacterium divides the plasmid should also be replicated.

50|$|Kits are {{available}} from varying manufacturers to purify plasmid DNA, which are named by size of bacterial culture and corresponding plasmid yield.

40|$|Lentiviral vectors (LVs) are {{powerful}} tools for transgene expression in vivo and in vitro.

It consists of three steps: 1) preparation and clearing of a bacterial lysate, 2) adsorption of DNA onto the QIAprep membrane, 3) washing and elution of plasmid DNA. All steps are performed without the use of phenol, chloroform, CsCl, ethidium bromide, and without alcohol precipitation. It usually takes less than 2 hours to finish the entire procedure...|$|E

Plasmid DNA from the bacterial isolates and marker plasmids of E. coli V 517 were extracted using Wizard Plus SV <b>Minipreps</b> plasmid DNA Purification kit (Promega, USA) and was separated in 0.8 % agarose gel at 70 volts for 4  h. After depurination, denaturation, and neutralization of the gel, DNAs were transferred onto a Hybond N + nylone membrane (Nycomed Amershamplc, Buckinghamshire, UK) with a vacuum blotting system for 3 – 4  h and fixed by UV exposure. The membrane with blotted DNA was sequentially subjected to pre-hybridization and hybridization with a labeled probe.

40|$|The {{isolation}} and characterization of mutants has been crucial in understanding {{a number of}} processes {{in the field of}} cell biology. In this exercise, students examine the effects of mutations in the secretory pathway on protein localization. Yeast strains deficient for synthesis of histidinol dehydrogenase are transformed with a plasmid encoding a chimeric protein. The chimera contains a signal sequence fused to histidinol dehydrogenase. A strain with a defect in the translocation of secretory proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) accumulates sufficient histidinol dehydrogenase in the cytoplasm to grow on media lacking histidine. In contrast, yeast proficient for secretion, or yeast with secretion defects later in the pathway, are unable to grow on media lacking histidine. Student analysis of the experimental yeast transformants and appropriate controls allows investigation into the effects of conditional defects in the secretory pathway on both cell viability and protein localization. The exercise is usually performed in a manner that allows students to execute a number of techniques common in molecular biology laboratories, including plasmid <b>minipreps,</b> restriction digestions, and Southern blots. Student understanding and enjoyment of the exercise was assessed by laboratory reports, oral and written examinations, and questionnaires. After completion of these experiments, students can describe the utility of protein fusions, the roles of mutant analysis in cell biology, and the steps taken by proteins transiting the secretory pathway...|$|R
30|$|For ligation, a {{constant}} 25  ng of vector was used, and varying amounts of insert ranging from 60 to 120  ng were tested for each size selection. The vector/insert (V/I) ratio, {{which gave the}} best efficiency and average insert size, was chosen. Ligation reactions were performed in 60  μl volumes and incubated at 16 °C for 10  h. After desalting, 2 – 3  μl of reactions were transformed into Escherichia coli EP 1300 (Epicentre) competent cells by electroporation (BioRad Gene Pulser® II Electroporation System). For electroporation, 1.25  kV and 200 × of resistance were used. The electroporated cells were immediately mixed with 1  ml of SOC media and grown for 1  h at 37 °C before separation on selective medium (LB medium) with 12.5  μg chloroamphenicol, 0.55  mM IPTG, and 80  μg/ml X-gal. After 18  h of incubation at 37 °C, a sampling of 10 – 20 colonies were picked and tested. Randomly selected white colonies were inoculated into 1  ml LB CM liquid medium and grown for 16  h at 37 °C. The liquid cultures were subjected to <b>minipreps</b> by an alkaline lysis protocol, and the DNA was digested with 10 U of Not I (NEB) for 4  h at 37 °C.

40|$|Abstract Background RNA {{quality and}} {{quantity}} are important factors for ensuring the accuracy of gene expression analysis and other RNA-based downstream applications. Extraction of high quality nucleic acids is difficult from neuronal cells and brain tissues as they are particularly rich in lipids. In addition, most common RNA extraction methods are phenol-based, resulting in RNA that may be incompatible with downstream applications such as gene expression. Findings In this work, a comparative analysis of the RNA quality obtained from SK-N-MC cells was performed using six commonly used RNA isolation kits: two phenol-based kits and four non-phenol based kits. The non-phenol based kits tested AxyPrep Multisource Total RNA <b>Miniprep,</b> RNeasy ® Mini, EasySpin and Ilustra RNAspin Mini RNA Isolation, all performed well and resulted in the isolation of high quality RNA, as evaluated by A 260 /A 280. The RNA extracted with AxyPrep Multisource Total RNA <b>Miniprep,</b> RNeasy ® Mini and EasySpin provided the highest RNA yields. In particular, the RNA isolated by AxyPrep Multisource Total RNA <b>Miniprep</b> Kit did not show any detectable genomic DNA contamination even without previous DNase treatment or after RNA direct PCR amplification using universal 18 S primers. Conclusions The RNA extracted from SK-N-MC cells with AxyPrep Multisource Total RNA <b>Miniprep</b> Kit was superior {{with respect to the}} RNA quality and concentration. This kit does not use aggressive organic solvents and RNA free of genomic DNA was isolated without the need for DNase treatment. </p...|$|E

40|$|Extraction of DNA {{from the}} sample matrix is a {{critical}} step in the detection of transgenic DNA in food and feed. The extraction efficiency can be affected by several {{factors such as the}} degree of processing of the foodstuffs and the presence of PCR inhibitors in the food sample. The aim of this work was the comparative analysis of the following five commercial DNA extraction and purification methods: Wizard“ <b>Minipreps</b> DNA Purification Resin (Promega), Custom Magnetic DNA Purification Reagents (Promega), Generation TM Capture Column Kit (Gentra Systems), Puregene“ DNA Isolation Kit (Gentra Systems), Gene Elute Plant Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Sigma-Aldrich). DNA was isolated from simple (flours), complex (feeds) and processed matrixes (bread, cakes and cookies) containing maize and/or soy among the ingredients. The quality and the concentration of the extracted DNA were determined spectrophotometrically while its suitability to PCR reaction was examined using a PCR system based on the amplification of two endogenous DNA sequences of maize and soy (zein and lectin, respectively). If amplifiable DNA was found, samples were then checked for the presence of the 35 S promoter and of the cryia (Bt 176 maize) and GTS (Roundup Ready soy) genes. As expected, the efficiency of DNA extraction was related to the type of matrix and to extraction method used. When compared for efficiency, the Wizard method showed the best results in terms of recovery and quality of DNA. Furthermore, by introducing some modifications to the standard procedure, the Wizard method allowed the recovery of amplifiable DNA also from highly processed food matrixes such as cookies and cakes. However, when the speed of the methods was compared, the Wizard method and the DNA Elution Kit (Gentra) showed the longest processing times. Finally, from a few processed matrixes (corn flakes and chocolate wafers) {{it was not possible to}} obtain DNA with any of the five tested method...|$|R

40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1989. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 159 - 172) Microfiche. xvii, 172 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmEarly in 1983, {{we began}} {{a study on}} the cyanobacterium Spirulina sp., stemming from a growing interest in the commercial production of this algae in the Hawaiian islands. The algae is grown primarily as a food supplement due to it's exceptional protein quality. It was proposed that through genetic manipulation, one might be able to further enhance the commercial exploitation of this algae. Although the molecular biology and techniques of genetic engineering in cyanobacteria has advanced rapidly in the past few years, the application to Spirulina has been minimal. The objective of this work was therefore to; 1) generate a shuttle vector and method of mobilization and 2) clone and characterize the phycobiliprotein genes for the purpose of exploiting these high expression, light regulated genes. To start, 15 available strains were screened for endogenous plasmids using the methods in the literature as they developed. The uniform response of the test strains to heavy metal and antibiotic tolerance (specifically to chromium and kanamycine), encouraged the pursuit of all avenues of detection. Unable to detect any plasmids in any strain, an attempt to clone a labile or megaplasmid (or origin of replication) into the E. coli replicating pACYC 184 or the Anacystis nidulans shuttle vector pPUC 29 (Van denHondel et al.) was investigated. With this "shotgun" library experiments were established to transform the algae and select for the potent chloramphenicol marker. Transformation conditions for cyanobacteria have generated numerous publications and we attempted to repeat most of them using the above mentioned vectors and libraries. The only conditions tested showing any increased survivability was when the algae was grown in iron depleted media and selecting by underagar injection. However, no cultures survived reselection. It became apparent that the presence of a restriction system required investigation. Whitehead et al. has published a procedure for the rapid screening for type II restriction enzymes. Using this method, results show an extremely powerful DNAse is present in Spirulina. Whether this is a restriction system or a nonspecific DNAse is not clear in that we were unable to determine a set of conditions that would produce digestion patterns other than a smear of low molecular weight DNA. This would apparently limit transformation as a method for gene transfer. The alternative method of conjugation has been attempted, however the plating of the mating mixture on mixed media (Spirulina media + 0. 5 % LB) resulted in mixotrophic lysis of the algae. Finally, in regard to the cloning of ~he phycobiliprotein genes, some unusual problems presented themselves. Using the clone pTP 1,and fragments thereof, from Agmenellum quad. (Pilot) as probe DNA, dozens of hybridization conditions were attempted. Only under the conditions of Lemeaux and Grossman (ref.) were we able to obtain definitive signals and only then when the genomic DNA was digested with EcoR 1, Bg 1 II, ClaI and PstI. The explanation for this is not evident from the data obtained in that the base composition, degree of methylation, and C-PC N-terminal amino acid sequence data are not unusual. The stringency conditions required, based on salt and temperature are not unique other than the absence of DNA and protein blocking agents. Further, colony hybridization for library screening was unsuccessful. Only through hybridization of Southern blots of <b>minipreps</b> run on a gel were we able to isolate four unique clones. The clones obtained are from sized Eco/Bgl digests of S. maxima genomic DNA cloned into pBR 322 and screened using the alpha structural region of pTP 1 as a probe. The restriction patterns and preliminary sequence data for the EcoRI and Bg 1 II ends are unique to each clone. They are similar in that most sites useful for subcloning into polylinker regions were not detected. Digesting with BstYI(XhoII) gave identical fragments, common to the alpha probe, for every clone however subcloning of these fragments has so far been unsuccessful...|$|R

30|$|Synthesized codon {{optimized}} (Genescript) phosphoketolase genes (Table  1) were amplified with respective primer pairs (see Additional file 1 : Table S 2 for all primers {{used in this}} study), and {{the yeast}} TEF 1 promoter and ADH 1 terminator were amplified from plasmid pSP-GM 1 (Chen et al. 2012). All xfpk genes were preceded by the Kozak sequence AAAACA to promote translation (Hamilton et al. 1987). A fragment composed of TEF 1 promoter, phosphoketolase gene, and ADH 1 terminator was constructed by fusion PCR according to complementary DNA-sequences added to the primers. pSP-GM 1 was linearized with restriction enzyme BglII (ThermoFisher), purified, and co-transformed together with purified xfpk PCR-fusion constructs into CEN.PK 113 - 5 D, and transformants were obtained by growth on SD-URA plates. Colonies were verified with diagnostic PCR. Positive clones were cultivated, plasmids purified with a Yeast plasmid <b>Miniprep</b> I kit (Zymo Research) and E. coli was transformed in order to amplify the plasmids. The plasmid sequences were verified with sequencing after plasmid extraction with a GeneJet <b>Miniprep</b> kit (Thermo Scientific).
