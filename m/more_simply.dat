5|$|The Euclidean {{algorithm}} calculates {{the greatest}} common divisor (GCD) of two natural numbers a and b. The {{greatest common divisor}} g is the largest natural number that divides both a and b without leaving a remainder. Synonyms for the GCD include the greatest common factor (GCF), the highest common factor (HCF), the highest common divisor (HCD), and the greatest common measure (GCM). The greatest common divisor is often written as gcd(a,b) or, <b>more</b> <b>simply,</b> as (a,b), although the latter notation is also used for other mathematical concepts, such as two-dimensional vectors.|$|E
5|$|The {{catalytic}} subunit α {{of protein}} kinase A {{is a key}} regulatory enzyme that in humans is encoded by the PRKACA gene. They named this new enzyme the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and proceeded to purify and characterize this new enzyme. Fischer and Krebs won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1992 for this discovery and their continued work on kinases, and their counterparts the protein phosphatases. Today, this cAMP-dependent protein kinase is <b>more</b> <b>simply</b> noted as PKA.|$|E

5|$|As Renaissance styles survived {{late in the}} city, the {{appearance}} of Baroque art was also delayed, but from the mid-18th century Klausenburg was once again at {{the centre of the}} development and spread of art in Transylvania, as it had been two centuries earlier. The first enthusiasts for Baroque were the Catholic Church and the landed aristocracy. Artists came initially from south Germany and Austria, {{but by the end of}} the century most of the work was by local craftsmen. The earliest signs of the new style appear in the furnishings of St. Michael's church: the altarpieces and pulpit, which date to the 1740s, are carved, painted and richly decorated with figures. An altarpiece depicting the Adoration of the Magi (1748–50) is the work of Franz Anton Maulbertsch. The earliest two-towered Baroque church was built by the Jesuits from 1718 to 1724 on the pattern of Košice and was later handed over to the Piarists. During the century <b>more</b> <b>simply</b> designed Baroque churches were built for the mendicant orders, Lutherans, Unitarians and the Orthodox Church. The noble families built houses and even palaces in the old town. The Baroque Bánffy Palace (1774–1785), constructed around a rectangular yard, is the masterpiece of Eberhardt Blaumann. Its peculiarity lies in {{the appearance}} of the principal façade.|$|E

25|$|In {{the study}} of graph algorithms, an {{implicit}} graph representation (or <b>more</b> <b>simply</b> implicit graph) is a graph whose vertices or edges are not represented as explicit objects in a computer's memory, but rather are determined algorithmically from some more concise input.|$|E
25|$|Specific syndromes of {{selective}} factors can create {{situations in which}} groups are selected because they display group properties which are selected-for.

25|$|This was proven by Georg Cantor in his 1874 uncountability proof, {{part of his}} {{groundbreaking}} {{study of}} different infinities, and later <b>more</b> <b>simply</b> in his diagonal argument.

25|$|In social psychology, {{attitudes are}} defined as learned, global {{evaluations}} of a person, object, place, or issue that influence thought and action.

Examples would include liking chocolate ice cream, or endorsing the values of a particular political party.|$|E
25|$|Small {{changes in}} the voltage applied across the base–emitter {{terminals}} cause the current between the emitter and the collector to change significantly. This effect {{can be used to}} amplify the input voltage or current. BJTs {{can be thought of as}} voltage-controlled current sources, but are <b>more</b> <b>simply</b> characterized as current-controlled current sources, or current amplifiers, due to the low impedance at the base.|$|E

25|$|Quality {{life jackets}} always provide more {{buoyancy}} than {{offered by the}} buoyancy aids alone. The positioning of the buoyancy on the wearer's torso is such that a righting moment (rotational force) results that will eventually turn most persons who are floating {{face down in the}} water (for example, because they are unconscious) into a face up orientation with their bodies inclined backward, unlike <b>more</b> <b>simply</b> designed common foam buoyancy vests.|$|E
