5000|$|The natural predators of the <b>marsh</b> <b>deer</b> [...] - [...] the jaguar (locally called onça or yaguaraté) (Panthera onca) and the puma (Puma concolor) - [...] {{have almost}} {{completely}} disappeared from its habitat. The former major threat was poaching for its antlers, {{but this is}} somewhat under control. Destruction of its habitat presents nowadays the major threat to <b>marsh</b> <b>deer.</b> The Yacyretá Dam altered {{an area in which}} several hundred individuals lived and the draining of marshes for farmland and cattle threaten hundreds of hectares every year in Argentina and Brazil. Contagious diseases from cattle are also a problem, though {{it has been shown that}} the deer is not affected by brucellosis.|$|E
50|$|The <b>marsh</b> <b>deer</b> lives only in marsh areas, {{notably the}} Pantanal and Chaco, {{in which the}} level of water is less than 70 cm deep. They are swift swimmers. The marshes with their high {{vegetation}} density protect them from predators and provide them with food. These deer also have a small migratory pattern, they follow the water levels between the dry season and flooding season. With the fluctuation in water levels, {{they are able to}} find new food sources that the water uncovers during the dry season. Some freshwater ponds on the Pantanal Wetland, Brazil reported low densities of individuals dictating that those ponds are not able to support large populations of <b>marsh</b> <b>deer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Wildlife in {{the area}} {{includes}} as many as 320 species of birds and 58 species of mammals in desert, grassland, marsh and rimrock habitats. Malheur {{is one of the}} most productive waterfowl breeding areas in the United States and is an essential migration stop for hundreds of thousands of birds following the Pacific Flyway. Among the migrating birds that depend upon this refuge as a migration stop for rest and foraging are northern pintail and tundra swan, lesser and greater sandhill crane, snow goose and Ross’ goose. Ducks, grebes, pelicans and trumpeter swans are drawn to the numerous ponds, <b>marshes</b> and lakes. <b>Deer,</b> antelopes, ducks, pheasants, thrashers and quails can be found in the upland areas in sagebrush, greasewood and wild rye.|$|R
60|$|The enamoured Montacute {{hung over}} her with pious rapture, as they {{examined}} together Mr. Roberts's Syrian drawings, and she alike charmed and astonished him by her familiarity with every locality and each detail. She {{looked like a}} beautiful prophetess as she dilated with solemn enthusiasm on the sacred scene. Tancred called on her every day, because when he called {{the first time he}} had announced his immediate departure, and so had been authorised to promise that he would pay his respects to her every day till he went. It was calculated that by these means, that is to say three or four visits, they might perhaps travel through Mr. Roberts's views together before he left England, which would facilitate their correspondence, for Tancred had engaged to write to the only person in the world worthy of receiving his letters. But, though separated, Lady Bertie and Bellair would be with him in spirit; and once she sighed and seemed to murmur that if his voyage could only be postponed awhile, she might in a manner become his fellow-pilgrim, for Lord Bertie, a great sportsman, had a desire to kill antelopes, and, wearied with the monotonous slaughter of English preserves, tired even of the eternal moors, had vague thoughts of seeking new sources of excitement amid the snipes of the Grecian <b>marshes,</b> and the <b>deer</b> and wild boars of the desert and the Syrian hills.|$|R
50|$|The park {{contains}} some 20,000 plant species, at least 600 bird species, and 174 species of mammals, 100 reptiles and amphibians, 232 fish and 1,300 butterfly. Rare species include the giant otter, spectacled bear, black caiman, <b>marsh</b> <b>deer,</b> and the maned wolf.|$|E
5000|$|As of 2009 the Ecological Station was a [...] "strict nature reserve" [...] under IUCN {{protected}} area category Ia, with a terrestrial area of 11200 ha.Endangered {{species in the}} ecological station include the jaguar (Panthera onca), giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) and <b>marsh</b> <b>deer</b> (Blastocerus dichotomus).|$|E
50|$|The reserve protects one of {{the last}} {{naturally}} flooded areas of the state, home to <b>marsh</b> <b>deer</b> and other species typical of this environment.It should reduce sand and clay mining, and strengthen enforcement against hunting the deer for sale of antlers or stuffed heads.The reserve supports environmental education and research.|$|E
50|$|This park {{is known}} for its {{sightings}} of <b>Marsh</b> <b>Deer,</b> Capybara, Spectacled Caiman, Caiman Lizards and the Yellow Anaconda.

50|$|The {{flood plain}} {{of the river}} {{is part of the}} Paraná Delta and Islands Ecoregion. The {{original}} ecosystem, especially in the Lower Delta, has been heavily modified by deforestation, hunting, fishing and the introduction of foreign species of flora, as well as damaged by domestic and industrial pollution. It hosts species such as the <b>marsh</b> <b>deer,</b> the capybara, the neotropical river otter, the Pampas cat, the jaguar, the coypu and the red-faced guan, some of them endangered.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} is in {{the transition}} between Amazon rainforest and the cerrado, which results in {{a high level of}} biodiversity.The park is flooded annually.Typical Amazon forest fauna include the robust capuchin monkey and howler monkey. Fauna of the cerrado include maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus) and pampas deer (Ozotoceros bezoarticus).Wetland fauna include <b>marsh</b> <b>deer</b> (Blastocerus dichotomus) and capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris).The park is also home to aquatic animals such as Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) and turtles.|$|E

50|$|Financial {{incentives}} envisioned in the Forest Code {{including tax}} exemptions on forest income and tax incentives for reforestation {{have not been}} implemented or have been substantially modified. The regulations prohibit trade in wildlife products and by-products including 14 plants species and 207 species of animal.These include the black caiman, manatee, jaguar, <b>marsh</b> <b>deer,</b> giant otter, macaw and giant anteater.However, enforcement has been hampered by lack of personnel, there is pressure from poor people who need the resources for survival, and tropical plants and animals fetch high prices in the international market.|$|E
50|$|NKMNP is {{of global}} importance, {{designated}} by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 2000. Its importance is partially because the vegetation in NKMNP is essentially “pristine”, with only minor human impacts from minimal logging activity {{experienced in the}} 1980s. NKMNP encompasses the Huanchaca Plateau, {{which is one of}} the largest protected tracts of undisturbed cerrado (upland) savannahs in the Neo-tropics. This area has some of the most threatened mega-fauna in the Americas, including Ozotoceros bezoarticus (Pampas deer), Blastocenus dichotomus (<b>marsh</b> <b>deer),</b> Chrysocyon brachyurus (maned wolf), Rhea americana (greater rhea), and Myrmecophaga tridacyla (giant anteater).|$|E
50|$|Ilha Grande is in a {{transition}} between cerrado (characteristic of the Pantanal) and seasonal Forest. Already fauna has several endemic species and/or endangered. Among the terrestrial fauna species were recorded as the <b>marsh</b> <b>deer</b> (Blastocelus dichotomus), the alligator-the-crop-yellow (Caiman Latorostris), the jaguar (Panthera onca), tapir (Tapirus terestris) {{and the giant}} anteater flag (Myrmecophata trydoctyla).

50|$|The {{remoteness}} of {{the islands}} - originally accessible only by boat - made them a hideout for outlaws and criminals from Buenos Aires and Montevideo. The marxist Liborio Justo lived there in the 1940s, the harsh environment and the fugitives who inhabited it, inspired his book of short stories, entitled Rio Abajo ("Down the River"), which was later made into a movie with the same title. Nowadays tourism {{is one of the}} main activities {{of the islands}}, where typical Delta wildlife such as the Neotropic cormorant, capybara and <b>marsh</b> <b>deer</b> can be seen.|$|E
50|$|Usually the {{rutting season}} {{coincides with the}} dry season but can change from animal to animal. They may use this to their {{advantage}} for breeding or finding mates because the densities of <b>marsh</b> <b>deer</b> are significantly higher on the Rio Negro marshland boundary {{during the dry season}} compared to the less dense, more distributed population during the flooded season. Gestation lasts approximately 271 days. The offspring (normally one per female, though occasionally twins are born) are born between October and November. The infant deer are whitish which becomes more adult-like after a year.|$|E
50|$|The wild canids {{found in}} Brazil are the maned wolf, bush dog, hoary fox, short-eared dog, crab-eating fox and pampas fox. The felines found in Brazil are the jaguar, the puma, the margay, the ocelot, the oncilla, and the jaguarundi. Other notable animals include the giant anteater, several {{varieties}} of sloths and armadillos, coati, giant river otter, tapir, peccaries, <b>marsh</b> <b>deer,</b> Pampas deer, and capybara (the world's largest existing rodent).
