5|$|According to British writer Errol Fuller, aviculturalists are rumoured to have bred birds {{similar in}} {{appearance}} to the Cuban <b>macaw.</b> These birds, however, are reportedly larger in size than the Cuban <b>macaw,</b> having been bred from larger <b>macaw</b> species.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Du Tertre's crude 1667 {{drawing and}} Labat's 1722 derivative, a few {{contemporary}} paintings depict red macaws {{that may be}} the Lesser Antillean <b>macaw.</b> A color plate accompanying a 1765 volume of Buffon's encyclopaedia Histoire Naturelle (no. 12 in Planches Enlumin√©es, entitled L'Ara Rouge) shows a red <b>macaw</b> with entirely red tail feathers and more red on the tertial and scapular feathers of the wing than are present on the scarlet <b>macaw.</b> Copies of the plate differ in the nuances used, but are identical in pattern. The painting suggests that a specimen may have been present in Europe at the time. The Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus cited the plate in his 1766 description of the scarlet <b>macaw,</b> but his description does not match the bird shown. A 1626 painting by the Dutch artist Roelant Savery, which also includes a dodo, shows a red <b>macaw</b> that agrees with the descriptions of the Lesser Antillean <b>macaw.</b> A second <b>macaw</b> in the painting may be the hypothetical extinct Martinique <b>macaw</b> (A. martinicus), but though many parrots were imported into Europe at the time from all over the world, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of such paintings today.|$|E
5|$|The American {{zoologist}} Austin Hobart Clark {{gave the}} Lesser Antillean <b>macaw</b> its scientific name, Ara guadeloupensis, in 1905, {{based on the}} contemporary accounts, and he also cited a 1765 color plate as possibly depicting this species. He wrote that it was different in several ways from the superficially similar scarlet <b>macaw</b> (A. macao), {{as well as the}} green-winged <b>macaw</b> (A. chloropterus) and the Cuban <b>macaw</b> (A. tricolor). Clark suggested the species might have existed on the islands of Dominica and Martinique, based on accounts of red macaws there, as well as on Guadeloupe. In his 1907 book Extinct Birds, the British zoologist Walter Rothschild instead claimed each island had its own species, and that the Lesser Antillean <b>macaw</b> was confined to Guadeloupe. In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway wrote that the macaws reported from Guadeloupe could have been imported to the region from elsewhere by the native population, but this is difficult to prove. Greenway also suggested that the scarlet <b>macaw</b> and the Cuban <b>macaw</b> formed a superspecies with the Lesser Antillean <b>macaw</b> and other hypothetical extinct species suggested for Jamaica and Hispaniola. According to the English paleontologist Julian Hume, the similarity between the Lesser Antillean <b>macaw</b> and the scarlet <b>macaw</b> indicates that they were close relatives, and that the Guadeloupe species may have descended from the mainland <b>macaw.</b>|$|E

50|$|This exhibit {{consists}} of two aviaries housing rare and endangered South American parrots and <b>macaws.</b> These include hyacinth <b>macaws,</b> in the aviary outside the Tropical Realm and Blue-throated <b>macaws</b> are housed in the other.|$|R
50|$|Limited tool use {{has been}} {{observed}} in both wild and captive hyacinth <b>macaws.</b> Reported sightings of tool use in wild parrots go {{as far back as}} 1863. Examples of tool use that have been observed usually involve a chewed leaf or pieces of wood. <b>Macaws</b> often incorporate these items when feeding on harder nuts. Their use allows the nuts the <b>macaws</b> eat to remain in position (prevent slipping) while they gnaw into it. It is not known whether this is learned social behavior or an innate trait, but observation on captive <b>macaws</b> shows that hand-raised <b>macaws</b> exhibit this behavior, as well. Comparisons show that older <b>macaws</b> were able to open seeds more efficiently.|$|R
5|$|The Cuban <b>macaw</b> or Cuban red <b>macaw</b> (Ara tricolor) was {{a species}} of <b>macaw</b> native to the main island of Cuba and the nearby Isla de la Juventud that became extinct in the late 19th century. Its {{relationship}} with other macaws in the genus Ara is uncertain, but {{it may have been}} closely related to the scarlet <b>macaw,</b> which has some similarities in appearance. It may also have been closely related, or identical, to the hypothetical Jamaican red <b>macaw.</b> No modern skeletons are known, but a few subfossil remains have been found on Cuba.|$|E
5|$|The Lesser Antillean <b>macaw</b> or Guadeloupe <b>macaw</b> (Ara guadeloupensis) is a {{hypothetical}} extinct species of <b>macaw</b> that {{is thought to}} have been endemic to the Lesser Antillean island region of Guadeloupe. In spite of the absence of conserved specimens, many details about the Lesser Antillean <b>macaw</b> are known from several contemporary accounts, and the bird is the subject of some illustrations. Austin Hobart Clark described the species {{on the basis of these}} accounts in 1905. Due to the lack of physical remains, and the possibility that sightings were of macaws from the South American mainland, doubts have been raised about the existence of this species. A phalanx bone from the island of Marie-Galante confirmed the existence of a similar-sized <b>macaw</b> inhabiting the region prior to the arrival of humans, and was correlated with the Lesser Antillean <b>macaw</b> in 2015. Later that year, historical sources distinguishing between the red macaws of Guadeloupe and the scarlet <b>macaw</b> (A. macao) of the mainland were identified, further supporting its validity.|$|E
5|$|What Bouton {{described}} {{is likely}} to remain a mystery, but various theories have been proposed. In 1906, Tommaso Salvadori noted that the Martinique <b>macaw</b> seemed similar to the blue-and-yellow <b>macaw</b> (Ara ararauna) of mainland South America, and may have been the same bird. The American ornithologist James Greenway suggested Bouton's description could have been based on a captive bird. Edwards' Dodo, a 1626 painting by the Dutch artist Roelant Savery, shows several birds including a blue and yellow <b>macaw,</b> which is different from the mainland bird in having yellow undertail covert feathers instead of blue, but the origin of this <b>macaw</b> is unknown. Another <b>macaw</b> in the painting may be the also extinct Lesser Antillean <b>macaw</b> (Ara guadeloupensis). Another Savery painting from about the same time shows a similar blue and yellow <b>macaw,</b> as does a mid-1700s illustration by the English naturalist Eleazar Albin. In 1936, a Cuban scientist claimed to have found a stuffed Martinique <b>macaw</b> specimen, which {{was supposed to have been}} collected in 1845. After examination it was shown to be a hoax, combining a burrowing parakeet (Cyanoliseus patagonus byroni) with the tail of a dove.|$|E
5|$|Austin Hobart Clark {{reported}} that juvenile Cuban <b>macaws</b> were green, {{though he did}} not provide any source for this claim. It is unclear whether green birds spotted on the island were in fact juvenile Cuban <b>macaws</b> or if they were instead feral military <b>macaws</b> (Ara militaris).|$|R

5000|$|Primolius is a genus of <b>macaws</b> {{comprising}} three species, {{which are}} native to South America. They are mainly green parrots with complex colouring including blues, reds and yellows. They have long tails, a large curved beak, and bare facial skin typical of <b>macaws</b> in general. They {{are less than}} 50 cm long, {{much smaller than the}} <b>macaws</b> of the Ara genus. <b>Macaws</b> less than about 50 cm long, including the Primolius genus, are sometimes called [...] "mini-macaws".|$|R
5|$|Many {{hypothetical}} extinct macaws {{were based}} only on contemporaneous accounts, but these species are considered dubious today. Several of them were named in the early 20th century by Rothschild, who {{had a tendency to}} name species based on little tangible evidence. Among others, the red-headed <b>macaw</b> (Ara erythrocephala) and the Jamaican red <b>macaw</b> (Ara gossei) were named for accounts of macaws on Jamaica, and the Dominican green-and-yellow <b>macaw</b> (Ara atwoodi) was supposedly from Dominica island. The violet <b>macaw</b> (Anodorhynchus purpurascens), which was named for accounts of blue parrots supposedly from Guadeloupe, is now thought to have been based on references to the Guadeloupe amazon (Amazona violacea).|$|E
5|$|Since {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} extinct macaws exist only for the species on Cuba, {{it is impossible to}} determine the species' relationships. It has been suggested that the closest mainland relative of the Cuban <b>macaw</b> is the scarlet <b>macaw</b> (Ara macao), due to the similar distribution of red and blue in their plumage, and the presence of a white patch around the eyes, naked except for lines of small red feathers. Furthermore, the range of the scarlet <b>macaw</b> extends to the margins of the Caribbean Sea. The Cuban <b>macaw</b> is distinct due to its lack of a yellow shoulder patch, its all-black beak, and its smaller size. The two also share a species of feather mite, which supports their relationship. James Greenway believed the scarlet <b>macaw</b> and the Cuban <b>macaw</b> formed a superspecies with the other extinct species suggested to have inhabited Jamaica, Hispaniola and Guadeloupe.|$|E
5|$|According to {{contemporary}} descriptions, {{the body of}} the Lesser Antillean <b>macaw</b> was red and the wings were red, blue and yellow. The tail feathers were between 38 and 51cm (15 and 20 in) long. Apart from the smaller size and the all-red coloration of the tail feathers, it resembled the scarlet <b>macaw</b> and may therefore have been a close relative of that species. The bird ate fruitincluding the poisonous manchineel, was monogamous, nested in trees and laid two eggs once or twice a year. Early writers described it as being abundant in Guadeloupe, but it was becoming rare by 1760, and only survived in uninhabited areas. Disease and hunting by humans are thought to have eradicated it shortly afterwards. The Lesser Antillean <b>macaw</b> is one of 13 extinct <b>macaw</b> species that have been proposed to have lived in the Caribbean islands. Many of these species are now considered dubious because only three are known from physical remains, and there are no extant endemic macaws on the islands today.|$|E
5|$|Both authors {{wrote that}} the <b>macaws</b> were the largest parrots of Guadeloupe, and {{stressed}} that the parrots of each Caribbean island were distinct, and could be differentiated both based on their morphology and their vocalizations. According to Hume, {{this means that the}} birds described could not simply have been escaped South American <b>macaws.</b> Furthermore, the docile and amiable nature described by Du Tertre and Labat does not match the behavior of South American <b>macaws.</b>|$|R

5|$|As many as 13 now-extinct {{species of}} <b>macaw</b> have {{variously}} been suggested {{to have lived}} on the Caribbean islands, {{but many of these}} were based on old descriptions or drawings and only represent hypothetical species. In addition to the Lesser Antillean <b>macaw,</b> only two endemic Caribbean <b>macaw</b> species are known from physical remains; the Cuban <b>macaw</b> is known from 19 museum skins and subfossils, and the Saint Croix <b>macaw</b> (A. autochthones) is known only from subfossils. Macaws are known to have been transported between the Caribbean islands and from mainland South America to the Caribbean both in historic times by Europeans and native peoples, and in prehistoric times by Paleoamericans. Parrots were important in the culture of native Caribbeans, and were among the gifts offered to Christopher Columbus when he reached the Bahamas in 1492. Historical records of macaws on these islands, therefore, may not have represented distinct, endemic species; {{it is also possible that}} these macaws were escaped or feral birds that had been transported to the islands from elsewhere. All the endemic Caribbean macaws were likely driven to extinction by humans in historic and prehistoric times. The identity and distribution of indigenous macaws in the Caribbean is only likely to be further resolved through paleontological discoveries and examination of contemporary reports and artwork.|$|E

50|$|Blue-throated <b>macaws</b> {{are most}} {{frequently}} found in monogamous pairs, but small groups of 7-9 do occur and one large roosting group of 70 is known. It is not known if these <b>macaws</b> will pair with another mate if their original mate dies. Their main mode of locomotion is flying, {{but they are also}} able to climb trees, maneuver along branches and walk on the ground. These birds are active during the day and usually stay in one general area. Blue-throated <b>macaws</b> communicate mostly by sound. When they suspect danger, they emit a very loud alarming call and promptly fly off. Blue-throated <b>macaws</b> are known {{to communicate with each other}} with quiet caws as well.|$|R
5|$|In 2015, a {{terminal}} phalanx bone (ungual claw bone) {{attributable to the}} genus Ara from south-western Marie-Galante was described by ecologists Monica Gala and Arnaud Lenoble. It was discovered in the Blanchard Cave during excavations in 2013-2014, in a fossil-bearing deposit dating to the late Pleistocene epoch. The deposit was radiocarbon dated to about 10,690 years ago; the earliest evidence of human settlement in the area has been dated to 5,300 years ago. This confirmed that the Guadeloupe region once had an endemic <b>macaw</b> which {{could not have been}} brought there by humans. All other <b>macaw</b> bones from the Lesser Antillean islands have been recovered from archaeological sites, and could therefore have been the remains of birds brought there by Amerindians. The size of the phalanx bone matched what was described for the Lesser Antillean <b>macaw</b> by contemporary writers, and the authors therefore correlated the two. They conceded that this connection could only be tentative, as there were no remains of the Lesser Antillean <b>macaw</b> to compare with.|$|E
5|$|The {{habitat of}} the Cuban <b>macaw</b> was open savanna terrain with {{scattered}} trees, {{typical of the}} Zapata Swamp area. Cuba was originally widely covered in forest, much of which has since been converted to cropland and pastures. Lomas de Rompe, where the <b>macaw</b> was also reported, had rainforest-like gallery forest.|$|E
5|$|Though Clark {{converted}} Du Tertre's tail measurement to 18 in (45.7cm), Lenoble {{pointed out}} that a 17th-century French foot unit was slightly larger than the English equivalent, and the measurement should rather be converted to 19.3 in (49cm), indicating a smaller size difference between the Lesser Antillean <b>macaw</b> and the scarlet <b>macaw.</b>|$|E
50|$|For {{more than}} a decade, the project is {{recording}} breeding biology data from large <b>macaws</b> by systematic way.

50|$|Blue-throated <b>macaws</b> usually breed once a {{year but}} if the eggs or nestlings are lost, they may produce a second clutch in the same {{breeding}} season. A clutch consists of one to three eggs and incubates for 26 days. Nestlings have a mass of approximately 18 g at hatching and fledge at 13 to 14 weeks. The young <b>macaws</b> are still fully dependent upon their parents for food after they fledge until {{they are capable of}} foraging by themselves. Even after this occurs, it has been observed that young blue-throated <b>macaws</b> will stay with their parents up to a year. During this time, the parents will skip an entire breeding season. Blue-throated <b>macaws</b> reach sexual maturity at about 5 years of age.|$|R
