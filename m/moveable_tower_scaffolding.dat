40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 NO and NO 2 (NOx) are {{fundamentally}} important species to tropospheric chemistry. NOx abundances {{are tied to}} ozone production and thus determine the oxidizing capacity of the troposphere. Nocturnal reactions of NOx are often considered a major loss pathway for NOx and ozone. Recent measurements have shown that nitryl chloride (ClNO 2) is produced at night by reactions of dinitrogen pentoxide (N 2 O 5) on chloride containing particles. ClNO 2 is photolyzed during the morning hours after sunrise to liberate highly reactive chlorine atoms. This chemistry takes place primarily in polluted environments where the concentrations of N 2 O 5 precursors, NOx, and ozone, are high, though it can likely occur in remote regions at lower intensities. The following describes estimates and ambient measurements of the reactive processes central to ClNO 2 formation and field measurements illustrating the potential importance of ClNO 2 as a NOx reservoir and as a chlorine atom source. The nocturnal reactions of N 2 O 5 to form ClNO 2 were traditionally thought of as marine phenomena given the more obvious source of particle-phase chloride offered by sea spray emissions. However, long term chemical measurement databases and aerosol thermodynamic models are employed to show that this chemistry is likely widespread as is suggested by recent field measurements of ClNO 2 in Boulder, CO, a site far removed from local sea salt aerosol sources. Direct measurements of N 2 O 5 reaction probability on ambient aerosol particles were made in La Jolla, CA, using a custom flow reactor alongside measurements of aerosol particle size distributions and non-refractory composition. The largest apparent driver of day-to-day variability in the measured reaction probabilities at this site was the particle nitrate loading. The relative change {{as a function of}} particle nitrate illustrates the atmospheric importance of the so-called "nitrate effect" on N 2 O 5 heterogeneous reactions that lead to the formation of ClNO 2. The magnitude and sources of chlorine atoms in marine air remain highly uncertain but have potentially important consequences for air quality in polluted coastal regions. Continuous measurements of ambient nitryl chloride and molecular chlorine concentrations were made in southern California. In the Los Angeles region, ClNO 2 was more ubiquitous than Cl 2 during most nights of the study period. These observations are used to estimate the relative importance of chlorine atom sources in the polluted marine boundary layer. In contrast to the emphasis in previous studies, ClNO 2 and hydrochloric acid are likely the dominant primary chlorine atom sources for the Los Angeles basin. As part of a wintertime field study in Weld County, CO, vertically resolved ClNO 2 and Cl 2 measurements taken on a 300 meter tall tower are reported. Gas and particle phase measurements aboard a <b>moveable</b> <b>tower</b> carriage allowed for {{a detailed description of the}} chemical state of the nocturnal atmosphere as a function of height. These observations show significant vertical structure in ClNO 2 and Cl 2 mixing ratios that undergo dynamic changes over the course of a night. From these measurements ClNO 2 yields from N 2 O 5 -aerosol reactions are inferred. The derived yields in these plumes suggest efficient ClNO 2 production within distinct combustion plumes originating from the Denver-Boulder urban corridor. Finally, the effects of ClNO 2 production, photolysis, and subsequent chlorine atom reactions on chemical species relevant to air quality are examined. ClNO 2 formation is incorporated into an existing Master Chemical Mechanism box model framework constrained by a large number of measurements taken during field studies in a polluted coastal environment. These results are compared to model runs excluding ClNO 2 formation to assess the effects of ClNO 2 on tropospheric oxidants, ozone, and nitrogen oxide partitioning...|$|R

40|$|The {{balance between}} {{photosynthesis}} and plant respiration in tropical forests may substantially affect the global carbon cycle. Woody tissue CO 2 efflux {{is a major}} component of total plant respiration, but estimates of ecosystem-scale rates are uncertain because of poor sampling in the upper canopy and across landscapes. To overcome these problems, we used a portable <b>scaffolding</b> <b>tower</b> to measure woody tissue CO 2 efflux from ground level to the canopy top across a range of sites of varying slope and soil phosphorus content in a primary tropical rain forest in Costa Rica. The objectives of this study were to: (1) determine whether to use surface area, volume, or biomass for modeling and extrapolating wood CO 2 efflux, (2) determine if wood CO 2 efflux varied seasonally, (3) identify if wood CO 2 efflux varied by functional group, height in canopy, soil fertility, or slope, and (4) extrapolate wood CO 2 efflux to the forest. CO 2 efflux from small diameter woody tissue (o 10 cm) was related to surface area, while CO 2 efflux from stems 410 cm was related to both surface area and volume.

40|$|International audienceRapid uptake of gaseous {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) by a forest canopy was observed at Borden in Southern Ontario, Canada during bud break in early spring 2003. High volume air samples were taken on 12 individual days at three different heights (44. 4, 29. 1, and 16. 7 m) on a <b>scaffolding</b> <b>tower</b> and {{on the forest floor}} below the canopy (1. 5 m). Concentrations of PAHs were positively correlated to ambient temperature, resulting from relatively warm and polluted air masses passing over the Eastern United States and Toronto prior to arriving at the sampling site. An analysis of vertical profiles and gas/particle partitioning of the PAHs showed that gaseous PAHs established a concentration gradient with height, whereas levels of particulate PAHs were relatively uniform, implying that only the uptake of gaseous PAHs by the forest canopy was sufficiently rapid to be observed. Specifically, the gaseous concentrations of intermediate PAHs, such as phenanthrene, anthracene, and pyrene, during budburst and leaf emergence were reduced within and above the canopy. When a gradient was observed, the percentage of PAHs on particles increased at the elevations experiencing a decrease in gas phase concentrations. The uptake of intermediate PAHs by the canopy also led to significant differences in gaseous PAH composition with height. These results are the most direct evidence yet of the filter effect of forest canopies for gaseous PAHs in early spring. PAH deposition fluxes and dry gaseous deposition velocities to the forest canopy were estimated from the concentration gradients...|$|R
40|$|To {{examine the}} impact of tree species on the water cycle in a wet {{tropical}} region, annual evapotranspiration (ET) was estimated in Costa Rican plantations of three native, broad-leaved tree species that contrasted strongly in leaf size, leaf area and phenology. Evapotranspiration was estimated using the Penman-Monteith equation for transpiration from the dry canopy, the equilibrium equation for evaporation from the understory and a modified Rutter model of interception for evaporation of water from the canopy when wetted by rainfall. Canopy conductance was estimated from stomatal conductance, leaf area and leaf boundary-layer conductance; canopy storage capacity and filling rate were estimated from throughfall measurements. Micrometeorological instruments were mounted on a <b>scaffolding</b> <b>tower.</b> Mean stomatal conductance, which ranged from 0 ? 1 to 0 ? 7 mol m- 2 s- 1, was similar to boundary-layer conductance, 0 ? 1 to 0 ? 5 mol m- 2 s- 1, indicating decoupling of stomata from atmospheric conditions. Mean canopy conductance varied from 0 ? 6 to 0 ? 7 mol m- 2 s- 1 in the 1994 wet season then dropped to 0 ? 3 - 0 ? 4 mol m- 2 s- 1 in stands of the two deciduous species, Cordia and Cedrela, as a result of reduced leaf area during the dry season. Despite increased understory evaporation, dry-season ET from these stands was only 78 - 81 f ET in stands of the evergreen species, Hyeronima. Maximum canopy water depth varied from 0 ? 2 to 2 ? 2 mm, causing modelled interception to vary from 6 o 25 f annual ET. Higher dry-season transpiration rates along with high rates of evaporation of intercepted rainfall in all seasons led to 14 igher annual ET in Hyeronima stands (1509 mm) than in stands of the species with lowest ET, Cedrela (1318 mm). Despite lack of strong physiological control on transpiration, tree species in wet tropical plantations can influence hydrological balanc...|$|R
50|$|According to {{the record}} of church {{inspection}} {{which took place in}} 1672, there were Wielkie (Great) and Małe (Small) Książki. They were Dutch villages which were not paying tithe. Małe Książki, a Dutch village, was granted to settlers (there were 51 of them in 1738) in 1720 for 30 years. In 1744 starost of Brodnica had taken Książki Małe on perpetual lease. Starost Pleskowski prolonged the lease for 40 years in 1750. In 1773 Książki was inhabited by 56 peasant families (including 4 Catholics). There was a wooden church dating from 1720. It was surrounded by a cemetery, there was also a bell <b>tower</b> on a <b>scaffolding.</b> An evangelical school was functioning there. When in 1797 the Prussian government sold the estate, it was covering 35 włóka (1 włóka chełmińska = 17.955 ha), 20 morga (1 morga = about 1 ha), 91 pręt (1 pręt = 5.0292 m) of arable land, 3 włóka of meadows and a big peat bog. According {{to the record}} from 1797, the estate Małe Książki was obliged to: pay rent for the government cashier office in Brodnica, provide feed for cavalry, provide horses in case of the king’s visit in the country, send people for wolf hunting and building fortifications and churches, transport alcohol from the brewery in Kruszyn, maintain flows and drainage ditches from the Sitnowski Canal which were crossing the area of the estate. The land was often changing its owners. In 1828 it was owned by widow Wierzbicka (her maiden name) from Trzcian. In the same year 61 peasants were granted freehold (46 włóka); they were obliged to maintain the Sitnowski Canal. 3 plots were added to Małe Książki in 1873. They previously belonged to Niemieckie (German) Łopatki and were exchanged for 360.08 ha which was used for building the railway Toruń-Olsztyn. The estate changed its owner once again in 1877. One year later, Małe Książki was renamed as “Gut Hohenkirch”. Until 1872 the estate changed its owner twice. The name “Hohenkirch” was used till 1868. A church was being built from 24 July 1868 to 18 June 1869. In 1900 a 4-class school, and 2-class school were under construction. Baptists established in Książki a chapel in 1864.|$|R
