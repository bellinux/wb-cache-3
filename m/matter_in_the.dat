5|$|Dark {{matter is}} the <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{universe}} that cannot be seen. Because of the gravitational effect it exerts on stars and galaxies, scientists know that approximately 80% of the <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> universe is dark matter. The spatial distribution of dark <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> universe is largely unknown; SIM Lite would have helped scientists answer to this question.|$|E

5|$|Between {{the stars}} lies the {{interstellar}} medium, {{a region of}} sparse <b>matter.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> densest regions, molecular clouds of molecular hydrogen and other elements create star-forming regions. These begin as a compact pre-stellar core or dark nebulae, which concentrate and collapse (in volumes determined by the Jeans length) to form compact protostars.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s and the 1980s, various {{observations}} {{showed that}} there is not sufficient visible <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal baryonic matter. In addition, the assumption that the universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, galaxy cluster velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, gravitational lensing studies, and X-ray measurements of galaxy clusters.|$|E
5|$|Kinematic {{studies of}} <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Milky Way and other galaxies have {{demonstrated}} {{that there is more}} mass than can be accounted for by visible matter.

5|$|Plasma may be {{the most}} {{abundant}} form of ordinary <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> universe, although this hypothesis is currently tentative based on the existence and unknown properties of dark matter.

5|$|All heavier {{elements}} (including those {{necessary for}} rocky planets like the Earth, and for carbon-based or other life) have thus been created since the Big Bang in stars which were {{hot enough to}} fuse helium itself. All elements other than hydrogen and helium today account for only 2% {{of the mass of}} atomic <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> universe. Helium-4, by contrast, makes up about 23% of the universe's ordinary matter—nearly all the ordinary matter that is not hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{measuring}} stellar motions {{within the}} Milky Way, SIM Lite was {{to measure the}} internal and average galactic motion {{of some of the}} neighboring galaxies near the Milky Way. The telescope's measurements were to be used in conjunction with other, currently available, data to provide astronomers with the first total mass measurements of individual galaxies. These numbers would enable scientists to estimate the spatial distribution of dark <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> local group of galaxies, and by extension, throughout the universe.|$|E

5|$|It {{is thought}} that the energy {{necessary}} to heat the corona is provided by turbulent motion in the convection zone below the photosphere, and two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain coronal heating. The first is wave heating, in which sound, gravitational or magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone. These waves travel upward and dissipate in the corona, depositing their energy in the ambient <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of heat. The other is magnetic heating, in which magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and released through magnetic reconnection {{in the form of}} large solar flares and myriad similar but smaller events—nanoflares.|$|E
