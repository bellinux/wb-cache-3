40|$|International audienceA {{dedicated}} trawling {{experiment was}} performed at three {{sites on the}} Gulf of Lion continental shelf, {{with the aim of}} assessing the resuspension of particulate and dissolved matter triggered by different types of trawls on muddy sediments. The different configurations were: (i) bottom trawl, with bobbin for ground rope (Rockhopper) : (ii) bottom trawl, without bobbin (Medits); and (iii) <b>pelagic</b> <b>trawl,</b> towed at 1 and 10 m above the seabed.;The plumes of resuspended sediment were measured using the acoustic backscattered intensity, from a towed ADCP. Concomitant profiles of particle size-distribution, light transmission and water samples were collected, outside and inside the plumes. The analysis of the data enabled derivation of the major physical and chemical characteristics of the plumes generated by the trawls; likewise, and to quantify the resuspension fluxes of sediment, particulate (PN, POC) and dissolved (nutrients) elements. The residence time and dispersal of the plumes were monitored and modelled, considering the settling velocity of the particulate matter and the near-bottom turbulence.;The results indicate that the bottom trawls produce significant resuspension, whilst the near-bottom and <b>mid-water</b> <b>pelagic</b> <b>trawls</b> have no impact upon the sediment. The sediment clouds at several hundreds metres astern of the bottom trawls are 3 - 6 m high and 70 - 200 m, wide; they were generated both by the otter doors and the net. The average suspended sediment concentrations measured in the plumes reach 50 mg l(- 1). Resuspension fluxes of sediment along the path of the trawls range from 190 g m(- 2) s(- 1), for the coarsest sediment (clayey silt) to 800 g m(- 2) s(- 1) for the finest sediment (silty clay). Whilst the resuspended loads of dissolved elements (nutrients) within the plume segment suggest a release of porewater, present at least in the first few centimetres of sediment, the particulate matter load only resulted from the resuspension of less than 1 mm thickness of the sediment bed. This discrepancy shows that a very small fraction of the sediment ploughed by the trawl is effectively injected into the water column.;The monitoring of the settling of the plumes indicates a rapid decay of the sediment load, during the first hour after its generation. Some of the sediment (about 10 - 15 % of the initial load) remains in suspension; this is due, probably, to the near-bottom turbulence that prevents the redeposition of the fine particles and aggregates. Lateral spreading of the plume is strongly dependent upon the variability of horizontal currents. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|In {{resource}} surveys, {{representative identification}} of species and sizes of fish is of vital importance. Various designs and sizes of <b>pelagic</b> <b>trawls</b> and techniques {{are used in}} the pelagic zone by Norwegian research vessels for this purpose. This paper describes trawl designs used for O-group surveys and a larger trawl used for adult fish. The largest trawl, which has a vertical opening of 30 m when towed at 3. 5 - 4 knots, can be rigged for close-to-surface trawling as well as for rnid- and deep-water trawling with minor adjustment of the rigging. The performance of the various trawls is described, based on geometric measurements using Scanmar instruments and observations with a TV-camera in a towed underwater vehicle. The trawl mouth area of the O-group trawl is approximately 10 x 10 m, and it can be rigged to catch efficiently in all depths from surface downwards.

40|$|Standard echo {{integration}} methodology {{has been}} applied to the stock of Norwegian spring spawning herring (Clupea harengus) wintering in the Ofotfjord-Tysfjord-Vestfjord system during late autumn 1995 and early winter 1996. The primary instruments of acoustic data collection and processing were the SIMRAD EK 500 / 38 -kHz echo sounder and the Bergen Echo Integrator. Biological sampling was effected by means of a so-called MultiSampler <b>pelagic</b> <b>trawl</b> in addition to standard <b>pelagic</b> <b>trawls.</b> Compensation was made during postprocessing for the effect of acoustic extinction. The major complication of the survey and challenge of the analysis has been stratification. This is discussed in the context of (1) mixing of immature and mature year classes, each with its own behavioural characteristics apropos of diurnal vertical migration and outwards spawning migration, (2) degree of achieved survey coverage, depending on fjord geometry, navigational hazards, available time, and fish distribution, and (3) ongoing spawning migration. Because of various uncertainties, a series of abundance estimates is presented. These are accompanied by fitted variogram models and geostatistical variance estimates...|$|R

Generally the schools seemed to be guided by the approaching vessel, but often the schools avoided {{the path of the}} vessel.

40|$|Large {{sardinella}} (Sardinella maderensis and Sardinella aurita) in warm {{waters off}} the coast of Africa are known to be a challenge for <b>pelagic</b> <b>trawl</b> sampling, for example during acoustic surveys for abundance estimation. We observed the swimming behaviour of sardinella mixed with other pelagic species, mainly Cunene horse mackerel (Trachurus trecae), during sampling with a <b>pelagic</b> <b>trawl</b> {{in the course of a}} study of swimming behaviour and endurance in the trawl belly and escape behaviour during hauling. The study consisted of two <b>pelagic</b> <b>trawl</b> surveys with R/V “Dr. Fridtjof Nansen” {{off the coast}} of Angola. We observed the fish with a trawl sonde in the trawl mouth, from a towed vehicle with sonar and camera positioned above the trawl belly or the trawl mouth, and finally with a camera with video recorder in the trawl belly. The behaviour of the fish was quantified from the video recordings by observing the swimming speed of the fish relative to the trawl and by recording the frequency of different behaviours. Two different reactions of schools were observed. We defined a “fright” reaction as a sudden reaction, where individuals swam in different directions and the collective school organisation collapsed for a few seconds. The second type of school reaction, the “adjust” reaction, did not cause the school organisation to disintegrate, but caused the whole school to gradually change its swimming direction by moving closer to one of the sides or the bottom of the trawl. The fish were also observed to swim along within the trawl for tens of minutes, possibly for up to around an hour. The main conclusion of this study is that pelagic species in warm water have the potential to actively swim forward in the trawl and escape during hauling. This could have substantial consequences for trawl sampling during surveys in terms of species- and sizedependent selectivity...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{the northeastern}} Atlantic, adult sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) {{is one of}} largest fish living on the shelf, and this species has {{important}} commercial value.

40|$|At a {{selected}} {{location in the}} Barents Sea acoustic observations, bottom- and <b>pelagic</b> <b>trawl</b> catch data were collected over a 10 day period. A {{large proportion of the}} fish were in the acoustic dead zone during the sampling period. Only during a few hours in the daytime high acoustic values were obtained. According to the <b>pelagic</b> <b>trawl</b> hauls these recordings consisted of large haddock ascending from the bottom, while small haddock and small redfish dominated the acoustic recordings at night. The bottom trawl catches showed higher variability and higher average catch rates during the day than at night, but the diurnal variations were relatively less pronounced than those of the acoustic recordings. The largest reduction in catch rates from day to night was observed for small haddock and redfish. This is consistent with the observation that these were found pelagicly during night. The acoustic observations and the bottom trawl catch rates were found to be correlated with diurnal cycles in observed light level and semidiurnal cycles in current speed. The results are interpreted in terms of variable catchability of the bottom trawl and variable availability for the echo sounder...|$|R
