5|$|Separate managements of the Bakerloo tube, Hampstead {{tube and}} Piccadilly tube {{companies}} <b>merge</b> <b>into</b> a single company—the London Electric Railway (LER). The lines {{continue to be}} identified by individual names.|$|E
5|$|Codeshare {{flights of}} Star Alliance {{airlines}} are consistent. This cooperation led to suspicions of anti-competitive behavior; the alliance was suspected by the European Union {{of being a}} virtual merger of its members, and speculation existed that if government regulations were relaxed the members would <b>merge</b> <b>into</b> one corporation.|$|E
5000|$|On 15 March 2013 Dongfeng Subdistrict <b>merged</b> <b>into</b> Liurong Subdistrict, Shishu Subdistrict <b>merged</b> <b>into</b> Guangta Subdistrict, Daxin Subdistrict <b>merged</b> <b>into</b> Renmin Subdistrict, and Guangwei Subdistrict <b>merged</b> <b>into</b> Beijing Subdistrict.|$|R

5|$|The {{interchange}} {{with the}} Southfield Freeway (M-39) was closed entirely in 1985 {{to replace the}} original exit design, which included four on-ramps that sharply merged into the left lanes of I-94. Reconstruction added new on-ramps that <b>merge</b> <b>into</b> the freeway's right lane, while also moving the carriageways of I-94 closer together.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} the highway was completed, the federal {{government}} began to promote suburbanization by moving several federal agencies out of the capital {{in order to protect}} them against nuclear attack. As a result, suburban neighborhoods began to appear in Laurel, Severn, Bowie, and Greenbelt. In addition, the road became a prime commuting route into both Washington and Baltimore, leading to suburban growth that would eventually cause the two distinct cities to <b>merge</b> <b>into</b> one large metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|At first sight, frogs seem rather defenceless {{because of}} their small size, slow movement, thin skin, and lack of {{defensive}} structures, such as spines, claws or teeth. Many use camouflage to avoid detection, the skin often being spotted or streaked in neutral colours that allow a stationary frog to <b>merge</b> <b>into</b> its surroundings. Some can make prodigious leaps, often into water, that help them to evade potential attackers, while many have other defensive adaptations and strategies.|$|E
50|$|Major {{manufacturers}} of cable boxes have included Jerrold Electronics, General Instrument (which Jerrold <b>merged</b> <b>into),</b> Cisco (which Scientific Atlanta <b>merged</b> <b>into),</b> and Motorola (which General Instruments <b>merged</b> <b>into).</b>|$|R

5|$|East of {{this station}} on the BMT side, the planned track {{connections}} to the Second Avenue Subway curved slightly north. After the tracks ended, the roadbed {{went on for a}} few hundred feet before ending. With the Second Avenue Subway connection, these tunnels now <b>merge</b> <b>into</b> the tunnels of Phase 1 of the IND Second Avenue Line.|$|E
5|$|John Baldwin (October 13, 1799 – December 28, 1884) was an American educator, and {{the founder}} of Baldwin Institute (later Baldwin University) in Berea, Ohio, which would {{eventually}} <b>merge</b> <b>into</b> Baldwin–Wallace College, now Baldwin-Wallace University. He was also the founder of Baker University and Baldwin City, Kansas, and contributed money to start schools in Bangalore, India that are today called Baldwin Boys High School, Baldwin Girls High School and Baldwin Co-Education Extension High School.|$|E
5|$|North of the station, tracks 7 and 6 <b>merge</b> <b>into</b> one track (with {{a switch}} from track 7 to track 8), tracks 5 through 2 <b>merge</b> <b>into</b> another track, and tracks 1 and 8 stay separate, {{so that there}} is a four-tracked {{structure}} when the BMT West End Line and BMT Sea Beach Line cross the Coney Island Creek. Before the structure crosses the creek, all four tracks have switches that connect the tracks to each other, before the West End and Sea Beach Lines split. Tracks from these lines then lead into Coney Island Yard. South of the station, tracks 4, 5, and 6 stay separate from the other tracks (with a pair of switches between tracks 5 and 6) and tracks 1, 2, and 3 merge and have a diamond crossover with track 4. Tracks 3 and 4 (the Brighton Line tracks) are above tracks 5 and 6 (the Culver Line tracks) at this point.|$|E

50|$|Additional mergers came in 1959, as the Charleston & Western Carolina was {{formally}} <b>merged</b> <b>into</b> the Atlantic Coast Line. The ACL was <b>merged</b> <b>into</b> the Seaboard Coast Line in 1967, and the SCL was <b>merged</b> <b>into</b> the Seaboard System in 1983. The final merger came in 1986, when the Seaboard System was <b>merged</b> <b>into</b> CSX Transportation.|$|R
50|$|Stornoway and the {{district}} of Lewis <b>merged</b> <b>into</b> the Western Isles. Also, the new Ross and Cromarty district excluded two other areas, which <b>merged</b> <b>into</b> other districts of the region. The electoral division of Kincardine was <b>merged</b> <b>into</b> Sutherland, and the South West electoral division (an area around and including Lochalsh) was <b>merged</b> <b>into</b> Skye and Lochalsh.|$|R
5|$|At Unionville, M-25 turns more {{westerly}} {{to round}} {{the bottom of}} Saginaw Bay into Bay City along Bay City-Forestville Road in Tuscola County. In the community of Quanicassee, it transitions to Center Road and crosses into Bay County. M-25 is routed the one-way street pair of 7th Street and McKinley Street before crossing the Veterans Memorial Bridge over the Saginaw River. West of the bridge, the one-way pairing of Jenny Street and Thomas Street are used before the two <b>merge</b> <b>into</b> Thomas Street west of the M-13 intersections.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s, budget {{concerns}} and national trends {{made it clear}} that Louisville Girls High School and duPont Manual would <b>merge</b> <b>into</b> one coeducational school. They finally did so in September 1950 and remained in the old Louisville Girls High School building. This fusion of institutions resulted in the birth of the modern duPont Manual High School – dropping 'Training' from its previous name. The same school building remains in use today, although two major additions have since been made. The middle school located on the building's first floor became Manly Junior High and moved to Manual's old building at Brook and Oak.|$|E
5|$|During its brief history, the AAFC, {{who would}} <b>merge</b> <b>into</b> the NFL for the 1950 season, used an {{identical}} playoff format to the NFL from 1946 to 1948. In 1949 (its last year), the AAFC would merge its two conferences {{when one of}} its teams folded, and use a four-team playoff system. In 1948, the aforementioned issue of playoff inequity came into play when the San Francisco 49ers would miss the playoffs with a 12–2 record; {{they were in the}} same conference as the 14–0 Cleveland Browns, who would go on to win the Western Conference and then the AAFC's championship game against the 7–7 Buffalo Bills (AAFC).|$|E

5|$|In 1821, after {{tensions}} between the NWC and HBC had erupted into violence the NWC was forced to <b>merge</b> <b>into</b> the HBC. As a result, the HBC acquired the Columbia District and its trade with China. At first the system of shipping furs via the American Perkins and Company was continued, but in 1822 the United States Customs Service imposed a heavy ad valorem duty on the proceeds. The HBC stopped using American middlemen and instead tried selling furs through the EIC. In 1824 and 1825 the HBC sold 20,000 beaver and 7,000 land-otter skins in China through the EIC, but the arrangement did not prove advantageous for either firm.|$|E
5|$|In November 2014, the bid {{was awarded}} to the {{consortium}} CityBridge, which consists of Qualcomm, Titan, Control Group, and Comark. In June 2015, Control Group and Titan announced that they would <b>merge</b> <b>into</b> one company called Intersection. Intersection is being led by a Sidewalk Labs-led group of investors who operate the company as a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. that focuses on solving problems unique to urban environments. Daniel L. Doctoroff, the former CEO of Bloomberg L.P. and former New York City Deputy Mayor for Economic Development and Rebuilding, is the CEO of Sidewalk Labs.|$|E
5|$|Juniperus communis berries {{vary from}} four to twelvemillimeters in diameter; other species are mostly similar in size, though some are larger, notably J. drupacea (20–28mm). Unlike the {{separated}} and woody scales of a typical pine cone, those in a juniper berry remain fleshy and <b>merge</b> <b>into</b> a unified covering surrounding the seeds. The berries are green when young, and mature to a purple-black colour over about 18 months in most species, including J. communis (shorter, 8–10 months in a few species, and about 24 months in J. drupacea). The mature, dark berries are usually but not exclusively used in cuisine, while gin is flavoured with fully grown but immature green berries.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{north of}} the I-495 interchange, the {{northbound}} off-ramp and southbound on-ramp at NY25A split, then run under a pedestrian bridge that connects 46th Avenue. Other pedestrian bridges cross over the highway near 42nd Avenue and at 33rd Avenue. The northbound exit 5 uses 206th Street as a de facto service road, while 207th Street {{is used in the}} same way for the northbound on-ramps. Real service roads run beneath the Port Washington Branch of the Long Island Rail Road to connect NY25A and 35th Avenue (exit6A). The service roads <b>merge</b> <b>into</b> the expressway north of 26th Avenue (exit6B).|$|E
5|$|The ECSC stood {{model for}} the {{communities}} set up after it by the Treaty of Rome in 1957, the European Economic Community and European Atomic Energy Community, with whom it shared its membership and some institutions. The 1967 Merger (Brussels) Treaty led to all of ECSC's institutions to <b>merge</b> <b>into</b> that of the European Economic Community, but the ECSC retained its own independent legal personality. In 2002, the Treaty of Paris expired and the ECSC ceased to exist in any form, its activities fully absorbed by the European Community under the framework of Amsterdam and Nice treaties.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files.

In the episode, the mysterious discovery of two skeletons leads Mulder and Scully to investigate. What they discover is a giant fungal growth that causes the agents to have two separate hallucinogenic episodes, which eventually <b>merge</b> <b>into</b> one shared hallucination. The two are saved thanks to an FBI rescue team led by Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi).|$|E
