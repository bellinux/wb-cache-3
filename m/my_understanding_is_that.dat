6000|$|Doubtless it {{is a sign}} {{of grace}} that the author of these {{definitions}} should attach no importance to any of them; but since, unfortunately, his whole argument turns upon the tacit assumption <b>that</b> they <b>are</b> important, I may not pass them over so lightly. The third I give up. Why anything should be capital when it is [...] "in course of exchange," [...] and not be capital under other circumstances, passes <b>my</b> <b>understanding.</b> We <b>are</b> told <b>that</b> [...] "that part of a farmer's crop held for sale or for seed, or to feed his help, in part payment of wages, would <b>be</b> accounted capital; <b>that</b> held for the care of his family would not be" [...] (p. 31). But I fail to discover any ground of reason or authority for the doctrine <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> only when a crop is about to be sold or sown, or given as wages, <b>that</b> it may <b>be</b> called capital. On the contrary, whether we consider custom or reason, so much of it as is stored away in ricks and barns during harvest, and remains there to be used in any of these ways months or years afterwards, is customarily and rightly termed capital. Surely, the meaning of the clumsy phrase <b>that</b> capital <b>is</b> [...] "wealth in the [174] course of exchange" [...] must <b>be</b> <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> [...] "wealth capable of being exchanged" [...] against labour or anything else. <b>That,</b> in fact, <b>is</b> the equivalent of the second definition, <b>that</b> capital <b>is</b> [...] "that part of wealth which is devoted to the aid of production." [...] Obviously, if you possess that for which men will give labour, you can aid production by means of that labour. And, again, it agrees with the first definition (borrowed from Adam Smith) <b>that</b> capital <b>is</b> [...] "that part of a man's stock which he expects to yield him a revenue." [...] For a revenue is both etymologically and in sense a [...] "return." [...] A man gives his labour in sowing grain, or in tending cattle, because he expects a [...] "return"--a [...] "revenue"--in the shape of the increase of the grain or of the herd; and also, in the latter case, in the shape of their labour and manure which [...] "aid the production" [...] of such increase. The grain and cattle of which he is possessed immediately after harvest is his capital; and his revenue for the twelvemonth, until the next harvest, is the surplus of grain and cattle over and above the amount with which he started. This is disposable for any purpose for which he may desire to use it, leaving him just as well off as he was {{at the beginning of the}} year. Whether the man keeps the surplus grain for sowing more land, and the surplus cattle for occupying more pasture; whether he exchanges them for other commodities, such as the use of the land (as rent); or labour (as [175] wages); or whether he feeds himself and his family, in no way alters their nature as revenue, or affects the fact <b>that</b> this revenue <b>is</b> merely disposable capital.|$|R

The study in question therefore suggested that the sunspot cycle was going to take longer than expected to reach its next peak, or, according to Hill, might not happen at all. Although Hill and his colleagues refused to discuss the possible effects this weaker solar cycle would have on climate, this was reported on by some media, including the Global Warming Policy Foundation, as evidence that a [...] "mini ice age" [...] was imminent. Hill responded to these reports by telling Reuters that [...] "We have not predicted a Little Ice Age," [...] but rather that [...] "We have predicted something going on with the Sun."

5000|$|The {{classical}} term metaphysical {{has evolved}} {{to include a}} much larger and more perplexing world. Instead of focusing on nature and purpose, it is now {{used to describe the}} world of spirits, faith healing, crystals and other paranormal elements. The scope of Metaphysical Fiction, too, has been enlarged accordingly, thus moving it closer to the realm of VF. Still there is a distinction, which author Talia Newland makes: [...] "Sometimes the terms are used synonymously but <b>my</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> visionary fiction is more obviously ‘spiritual’ in nature, and that an individual’s movement towards self-actualization is a primary theme. In metaphysical fiction, though the philosophy underlies the story, the story takes precedence over expression of the philosophy; in visionary fiction the expression of the philosophy {{is more important than the}} story.According to Karen Rider, [...] "Metaphysical Fiction encompasses topics like energy healing, past lives, intuition...events or experiences that we may be able to subjectively experience or sense but cannot objectively measure or explain. In the narrative, metaphysical phenomenon is part of ordinary human experience in ways that create conflict for the characters, propelling the story forward to find out how will the character deal with these events." [...] Again the active/passive focus rule above can be used to differentiate the Metaphysical Fiction from VF although more genre-crossing can be expected.|$|E

[...] That morning, the Chaser team along with the ABC managing director, Mark Scott, apologised for airing the skit, with Scott stating that [...] "We have unreservedly apologised for airing that skit,...It's very clear today from the reaction that it's caused considerable offence and distress, particularly to parents of children that are seriously ill....I've spoken to Julian Morrow from The Chaser and <b>my</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> certainly wasn't the intention of the script, but that's the consequences of it."

I mean we all know that The Chaser push the edges and it's a tightrope that we walk, and I suppose there are many, many skits that they've put to air that have offended someone along the way - that's part of the nature of the satirical and black comedy that they do." [...] The skit has also been cut from any further television airings. The ABC announced on Friday that The Chaser's War on Everything will be suspended for 2 weeks.
