40|$|Like many {{fundamental}} {{episodes of}} the history of science, also Boltzmann’s route to the statistical version of thermodynamics has progressively crystalized in a standard historiographical reconstruction, a so-called “received view”. According to it, the initial purely mechanical standpoint adopted by Boltzmann was proved unteneable by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> cogent <b>objections</b> which obliged him to change his mind and to framed the Second Principle of thermodynamcs in a statistical way. For seek of simplicity henceforth I refer to this view as the Klein thesis”, because it was clearly developed {{for the first time in}} Martin J. Klein’s important paper “The Development of Boltzmann’s Statistical Ideas”. Furthermore, for seek of completeness, I divide the Klein thesis in five sub-theses: (K 1) Boltzmann’s view of the role and the meaning of probability deeply changed from 1868 to 1877. 1 (K 2) This change is due more to external criticisms than to a natural internal evolution. 2 (K 3) The theory framed in 1872 is a purely mechanical one.
