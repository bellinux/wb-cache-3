50|$|This {{definition}} of lens power relies upon an arbitrary decision {{to split the}} angular magnification of the instrument into separate factors for the eyepiece and the objective.

40|$|Background: Augmented reality {{technology}} {{has been used for}} intraoperative image guidance through the overlay of virtual images, from preoperative imaging studies, onto the real-world surgical field. Although setups based on augmented reality have been used for various neurosurgical pathologies, very few cases have been reported for the surgery of arteriovenous malformations (AVM). We present our experience with AVM surgery using a system designed for image injection of virtual images into the operating <b>microscope's</b> <b>eyepiece,</b> and discuss why augmented reality may be less appealing in this form of surgery. Methods: N= 5 patients underwent AVM resection assisted by augmented reality. Virtual three-dimensional models of patients' heads, skulls, AVM nidi, and feeder and drainage vessels were selectively segmented and injected into the <b>microscope's</b> <b>eyepiece</b> for intraoperative image guidance, and their usefulness was assessed in each case. Results: Although the setup helped in performing tailored craniotomies, in guiding dissection and in localizing drainage veins, it did not provide the surgeon with useful information concerning feeder arteries, due to the complexity of AVM angioarchitecture. Conclusion: The difficulty in intraoperatively conveying useful information on feeder vessels may make augmented reality a less engaging tool in this form of surgery, and might explain its underrepresentation in the literature. Integrating an AVM's hemodynamic characteristics into the augmented rendering could make it more suited to AVM surgery...|$|R

Looking through <b>microscope</b> <b>eyepieces,</b> while performing a complex microsurgical reconstruction for hours sitting or standing relatively motionless often in uncomfortable positions, is not uncommon. It is not unreasonable to see how years of performing surgery under these strenuous physically demanding conditions could lead microsurgeons to prematurely retire from active practice, and in doing so, deprive the field {{of what could be}} their most fruitful years. The use of video technology in many surgical specialties is now considered routine. As an alternative to the operating microscope, advances in video technology can now permit the surgeon to view a microsurgical field on a video monitor in three dimensions without the necessity of physically looking through the <b>microscope</b> <b>eyepieces.</b> The conventional microscope magnifies the operative field and brings it mechanically and stereoscopically into the surgeon's view.|$|E

Although this technology could conceivably address certain inherent problems of extracranial-to-intracranial bypass procedures, this potential has not been explored to date. We evaluate the usefulness of an augmented reality-based setup, which could help in harvesting donor vessels through their precise localization in real-time, in performing tailored craniotomies, and in identifying preoperatively selected recipient vessels for the purpose of anastomosis. Methods: Our method was applied to three patients suffering from Moya-Moya disease who underwent superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery anastomoses, and to one patient who underwent an occipital artery-to-posteroinferior cerebellar artery bypass due to a dissecting aneurysm of the vertebral artery. Patients' heads, skulls and extracranial and intracranial vessels were preoperatively segmented from 3 -dimensional image data sets (3 -dimensional digital subtraction angiography, angio-magnetic resonance imaging, angio-computed tomography), and injected intraoperatively into the operating <b>microscope's</b> <b>eyepiece</b> for image guidance.

Agreement between the manual tally and ImageJ assessments was very high at low PIs. Agreement between eyeball assessments and ImageJ analysis varied between pathologists.

Conclusions Manual tally counts of 2000 cells exhibited similar levels of accuracy to the gold standard, especially at low PIs. Eyeball estimates were significantly less accurate than the gold standard.

40|$|Abstract—A {{method of}} {{improving}} coating thickness measurement repeatability {{of the ball}} crater method is proposed. The improvement is realized by using image processing techniques to measure the radii of crater circles from a microscope image. While traditional methods use {{a limited number of}} operator-selected points on a circle edge to calculate the radius value, the new method measures the radius by fitting a circle to all edge points of a crater circle edge, which is automatically extracted from the microscope image of the crater by image processing techniques. This eliminates the randomness introduced by human operators in the traditional methods and improves the measurement repeatability. Experimental results confirm the feasibility of our method and its potential in improving the measurement repeatability and increasing measurement accuracy of the ball crater method. Traditional methods of measuring the radii of the circles are subjective as they involve the use of human operators. For example, one method (two point method) is to move the sample stage by a micrometer drive in a direction normal to a line on the <b>microscope</b> <b>eyepiece</b> reticles and record the readings of the micrometer at two positions, where the line becomes the tangent of the circle [2]. The subtraction of the two readings provides the diameter of the circle. These two positions are defined by the operator.

In the latter method, the locations of the three points are chosen by the operator. Index Terms—Digital image processing, measurement repeatability, thickness measurement, coatings T I...|$|R

The traditional visual gridline intersection (VGI) method, which consists in a direct visual examination of the intersections of hyphae with gridlines on a <b>microscope</b> <b>eyepiece</b> after aqueous extraction, membrane-filtration, and staining (e. g., with trypan blue), was refined. For this, (i) images of the stained hyphae were taken by using a digital photomicrography technique to avoid {{the use of the}} microscope and the method was referred to as "digital gridline intersection" (DGI) method; and (ii), the images taken in (i) were processed and the hyphal length was measured by using ImageJ software, referred to as the "photomicrography-ImageJ processing" (PIP) method. The DGI and PIP methods were tested using known grade lengths of possum fur. Then they were applied to measure the hyphal lengths in soils with contrasting phosphorus (P) fertility status. Linear regressions were obtained between the known lengths (Lknown) of possum fur and the values determined by using either the DGI (LDGI) (LDGI = 0. 37 + 0. 97 × Lknown, r 2 = 0. 86) or PIP (LPIP) methods (LPIP = 0. 33 + 1. 01 × Lknown, r 2 = 0. 98). There were no significant (P > 0. 05) differences between the LDGI and LPIP values. While both methods provided accurate estimation (slope of regression being 1. 0), the PIP method was more precise, as reflected by a higher value of r 2 and lower coefficients of variation. The average hyphal lengths (6. 5 - 19. 4 m g- 1) obtained by the use of these methods were in the range of those typically reported in the literature (3 - 30 m g- 1). Roots growing in P-deficient soil developed 2. 5 times as many hyphae as roots growing in P-rich soil (17. 4 vs 7. 2 m g- 1). These tests confirmed that the use of digital photomicrography in conjunction with either the grid-line intersection principle or image processing is a suitable method for the measurement of AMF hyphal lengths in soils for comparative investigations...|$|R
40|$|OBJECT: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the integration of positron emission tomography (PET) scanning data into the image-guided resection of brain tumors. METHODS: Positron emission tomography scans obtained using fluorine- 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and L-[methyl- 11 C]methionine (MET) were combined with magnetic resonance (MR) images in the navigational planning of 103 resections of brain tumors (63 low-grade gliomas [LGGs] and 40 high-grade gliomas [HGGs]). These procedures were performed in 91 patients (57 males and 34 females) in whom tumor boundaries could not be accurately identified on MR images for navigation-based resection. The level and distribution of PET tracer uptake in the tumor were analyzed to define the lesion contours, which in turn yielded a PET volume. The PET scanning-demonstrated lesion volume was subsequently projected onto MR images and compared with MR imaging data (MR volume) to define a final target volume for navigation-based resection-the tumor contours were displayed in the <b>microscope's</b> <b>eyepiece.</b> Maximal tumor resection was accomplished in each case, with the intention of removing the entire area of abnormal metabolic activity visualized during surgical planning. Early postoperative MR imaging and PET scanning studies were performed to assess the quality of tumor resection. Both pre- and postoperative analyses of MR and PET images revealed whether integrating PET data into the navigational planning contributed to improved tumor volume definition and tumor resection. Metabolic information on tumor heterogeneity or extent was useful in planning the surgery. In 83 (80 %) of 103 procedures, PET studies contributed to defining a final target volume different from that obtained with MR imaging alone. Furthermore, FDG-PET scanning, which was performed in a majority of HGG cases, showed that PET volume was less extended than the MR volume in 16 of 21 cases and contributed to targeting the resection to the hypermetabolic (anaplastic) area in 11 (69 %) of 16 cases. Performed in 59 LGG cases and 23 HGG cases, MET-PET demonstrated that the PET volume did not match the MR volume and improved the tumor volume definition in 52 (88 %) of 59 and 18 (78 %) of 23, respectively. Total resection of the area of increased PET tracer uptake was achieved in 54 (52 %) of 103 procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Imaging guidance with PET scanning provided independent and complementary information that helped to assess tumor extent and plan tumor resection better than with MR imaging guidance alone. The PET scanning guidance could help increase the amount of tumor removed and target image-guided resection to tumor portions that represent the highest evolving potential.

Purpose: The purpose of this histologic and histomorphometric study {{was to assess the}} osteogenic potential and the quantity of new trabecular bone formation after implantation of OCP and BMG alone and in combination into the cranial defects in rat. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 100 young male Sprague Dawley rats (5 - 6 weeks age and 120 - 150 gr weight) were divided into four groups randomly. A full thickness standard trephine defect 5 mm in diameter was made in the rat’s parietal bone, and 5 mg of OCP, BMG alone and in combination were implanted into the defects. No OCP and BMG particles were implanted in control group which was otherwise treated identically. On the 5 th, 7 th, 14 th, 21 st and 56 th days after implantation, the rats were killed and bone samples collected. After processing the samples by routine histological procedures, 5 µm thick sections of bone were cut and stained with Haematoxyline & Eosin (H&E) and Alcian Blue and studied histologically and histomorphometrically using light <b>microscope</b> and <b>eyepiece</b> graticule. The amount of newly formed bone was quantitatively measured by the use of histomorphometric methods. Data were analyzed with SAS statistical package using ANOVA and Duncan tests. Results: In the experimental groups, the new bone formation was initiated from the margin of defects during 5 - 14 days after implantation. During 14 - 21 days after implantation, bone marrow cavities and bone marrow tissues in newly formed bone were seen. By the end of the study, the newly formed bone increased and was relatively matured and almost all of the implanted materials were absorbed. In control group, {{at the end of the}} study, a few clusters of new bone were seen near to the defect margins and host bone. The histomorphometric analysis indicated statistical significant differences in the amount of newly formed bone between the experimental and control groups (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Implants of OCP/BMG appear to stimulate bone induction and new bone growth in bone defects greater than the other groups and these biomaterials could be used in the repair of cranial bone defects in clinical situations...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLipid {{droplets}} {{have been}} demonstrated within both explanted porcine bioprostheses and normal porcine aortic valves. Because of the increasing interest in pulmonary valves as an allograft or xenograft aortic valve substitute, we examined the incidence and distribution of such lipid deposits in 50 porcine aortic valves and 50 matched porcine pulmonary valves. All 300 cusps were removed with surgical scissors and, under a dissecting microscope, the ventricularis layer was removed to expose the spongiosal layer. Macroscopic extracellular lipid droplets were exposed. The position and amount of the visible unstained droplets were analyzed {{by means of a}} dissecting <b>microscope</b> with an <b>eyepiece</b> grid and stereology point-counting techniques to provide an area-density average spatial probability map for each cusp. Only 8 % of porcine aortic valves were free of lipid, with the distribution of the lipids being 52 % ± 14 % right coronary cusp, 90 % ± 8 % left coronary cusp, and 68 % ± 13 % noncoronary cusp. Of the pulmonary valves, 60 % were free of lipid, with the incidence of lipids being 26 % ± 12 % left cusp, 6 % ± 7 % right cusp, and 12 % ± 9 % anterior cusp. Subsequently, lipid cluster samples underwent thin-layer chromatography, which showed them to be phospholipids, oleic acid (fatty acid), triglycerides, and unesterified cholesterol. One primary mode of bioprosthetic valve failure is leaflet calcification. The similarity of distribution within the spongiosal layer between leaflet calcification and intrinsic cusp lipids suggests that the observed lipids might act as a nucleation site for calcification. The substantially lower incidence of lipid in pulmonary valves therefore may represent a potential benefit when these valves are considered for use as aortic valve replacements.
