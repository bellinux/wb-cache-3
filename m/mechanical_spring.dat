500|$|Here, permittance is Heaviside's {{term for}} capacitance. [...] He {{did not like}} any term that {{suggested}} that a capacitor was a container for holding charge. [...] He rejected the terms capacity (capacitance) and capacious (capacitive) and their inverses incapacity and incapacious. [...] The terms current in his time for a capacitor were condenser (suggesting that the [...] "electric fluid" [...] could be condensed out) and leyden after the Leyden jar, an early form of capacitor, also suggesting some sort of storage. [...] Heaviside preferred the analogy of a <b>mechanical</b> <b>spring</b> under compression, hence his preference for terms that suggested a property of a spring. [...] This preference {{was a result of}} Heaviside following James Clerk Maxwell's view of electric current, or at least, Heaviside's interpretation of it. [...] In this view, electric current is a flow caused by the electromotive force and is the analogue of velocity caused by a mechanical force. [...] At the capacitor, this current causes a [...] "displacement" [...] whose rate of change is equal to the current. [...] The displacement is viewed as an electric strain, like a mechanical strain in a compressed spring. [...] The existence of a flow of physical charge is denied, as is the buildup of charge on the capacitor plates. [...] This is replaced with the concept of divergence of the displacement field at the plates, which is numerically equal to the charge collected on the plates in the charge flow view.|$|E

Recently, new power electronics devices named electric springs have been developed for providing voltage regulation for distribution networks and allowing the load demand to follow power generation. This paper summarizes recent R&D on electric springs and their potential functions for future smart grid. Electric springs can be associated with electric appliances, forming a new generation of smart loads which can adapt according to the availability of power from renewable energy sources. When massively distributed over the power grid, they could provide highly distributed and robust support for the smart grid, similar to the arrays of <b>mechanical</b> <b>springs</b> supporting a mattress.

50|$|The energy {{dissipated}} {{within a}} medium as sound travels through it {{is analogous to}} the energy dissipated in electrical resistors or that dissipated in mechanical dampers for mechanical motion transmission systems. All three are equivalent to the resistive part of a system of resistive and reactive elements. The resistive elements dissipate energy (irreversibly into heat) and the reactive elements store and release energy (reversibly, neglecting small losses). The reactive parts of an acoustic medium are determined by its bulk modulus and its density, analogous to respectively an electrical capacitor and an electrical inductor, and analogous to, respectively, a <b>mechanical</b> <b>spring</b> attached to a mass.|$|E
50|$|Forced {{dithering}} can largely {{overcome this}} problem. The ring laser cavity is rotated clockwise and anti-clockwise about its axis using a <b>mechanical</b> <b>spring</b> driven at its resonance frequency. This {{ensures that the}} angular velocity {{of the system is}} usually far from the lock-in threshold. Typical rates are 400 Hz, with a peak dither velocity of 1 arc-second per second. Dither does not fix the lock-in problem completely, as each time the direction of rotation is reversed, a short time interval exists in which the rotation rate is near zero and lock-in can briefly occur. If a pure frequency oscillation is maintained, these small lock-in intervals can accumulate. This was remedied by introducing noise to the 400 Hz vibration.|$|E
50|$|The {{air springs}} were {{designed}} to provide a smooth ride, with the additional ability to raise the body of the vehicle for off-road clearance and lower it for higher-speeds road driving. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>springs,</b> for which deflection is proportional to load, cannot do this; with ECAS height is largely independent of load.

40|$|The {{frequency}} range over which a linear passive vibration isolator is effective is often {{limited by the}} mount stiffness required to support a static load. This can be improved upon by incorporating a negative stiffness element in the mount such that the dynamic stiffness is {{much less than the}} static stiffness. In this case, it can be referred to as a high-static–low-dynamic stiffness (HSLDS) mount. This paper is concerned with a theoretical and experimental study of one such mount. It comprises two vertical <b>mechanical</b> <b>springs</b> between which an isolated mass is mounted. At the outer edge of each spring, there is a permanent magnet. In the experimental work reported here, the isolated mass is also a magnet arranged so that it is attracted by the other magnets. Thus, the combination of magnets acts as a negative stiffness counteracting the positive stiffness provided by the <b>mechanical</b> <b>springs.</b> Although the HSLDS suspension system will inevitably be nonlinear, it is shown that for small oscillations the mount considered here is linear. The measured transmissibility is compared with a comparable linear mass–spring–damper system to show the advantages offered by the HSLDS mount. <br/...|$|R

[...] Height is controlled automatically based on speed and undercarriage sensors, but a manual ride height switch allows control over the suspension by the driver.

5000|$|Springs {{for energy}} storage {{can be made}} of SWCNTs or MWCNTs {{arranged}} in dense bundles of long, aligned tubes called 'forests' of CNTs [...] that are grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The 'forests' can grow to heights of up to 6mm. A deformed CNT requires a support structure {{to carry the load}} of the spring prior to discharge. A <b>mechanical</b> <b>spring</b> must be coupled to external mechanisms to build a power source that is functionally useful. On its own a spring stores potential energy when an external force is applied to it but releases the energy in a single rapid burst once the force is removed. An effective power source needs to store energy over a period of time, release the energy only when needed and discharge the energy at a desired power level. A CNT based portable power source should have a basic architecture made of four main components: a CNT spring, a supporting structure for the spring, a generator-motor combination, and a coupling mechanism between the spring and the generator.|$|E
40|$|Abstract An {{innovative}} magnetically levitated {{system design}} {{is presented in}} this paper. The proof mass, used as the seismic detection components for gyroscopes, is levitated by the presented micro-coil actuator so that the concerns that mechanical fatigue, asymmetry and misalignments, which are inevitably present in the traditional <b>mechanical</b> <b>springs</b> design, can be ruled out. In addition, the limited range of dual-axis motion of the proof mass is completely relaxed and therefore the resolution and sensitivity of the gyroscope can be greatly upgraded. That is, the proof mass can be much at higher frequencies and the stroke of the sense-mode motion can be more enlarged, {{in comparison with the}} conventional design (i. e., <b>mechanical</b> <b>springs).</b> In addition, self-sensing technique is employed to replace the gap sensors which provide the feedback signal for position regulation of the proof mass, for the sake of cost-down for mass production. A sliding mode control strategy is included to account for the effects of nonlinearity of the maglev system dynamics and hysteresis uncertainty of the micro-coil actuator. The proposed controller is verified by computer simulations and experiments to illustrate its superior capability to stabilize the inherently unstable maglev system and ensure fast response for the lateral position regulation of the seismic proof mass...|$|R
