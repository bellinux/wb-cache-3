40|$|The work {{described}} in this paper was carried out {{as part of the}} development of the NEMESYS experiment (RACE NEMESYS Project [11]). This paper describes the modelling of an experimental Traffic and Quality of Service (QoS) Telecommunications Management Network (TMN) system that manages a simulated Integrated Broadband Communications (<b>IBC)</b> <b>network</b> based on Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technology. The TMN system of the <b>IBC</b> <b>network</b> is based on the emerging TMN standards [1] and TMN Architecture [2]. The modelling techniques used in the NEMESYS experiment are based on the emerging Open Distributed Processing (ODP) [3] viewpoints and the OSI/Network Management Forum (OSI/ NMF) [4] perspectives. The entire NEMESYS experimental system, from the <b>IBC</b> <b>network</b> (a simulator) to the TMN system was modelled using the ODP viewpoints, while the OSI/NMF perspectives were used to model and implement the QoS management functions of the TMN system. Our conclusions on this subject are outlined...|$|R

The VPN concept aims at meeting these requirements and, moreover, advancing the current telecommunication environment by offering value-added services at a relative low cost and at an enhanced quality compared to the basic services offered by the network operators. In general VPN services are considered as an application of Intelligent Networks (IN) ...|$|R

Although he opposes Greg's decision, Danton Miller, the head of programming, is unable to overrule his boss. Soon afterward, feeling threatened by Greg's support of Robin's plan to take his newscast to prime-time, Dan decides to build a variety show around second-rate comedian Christie Lane to prove that the audience prefers crass entertainment to more cerebral programming.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{concentrates}} on the traffic management functions for a multi-service <b>IBC</b> <b>network</b> implemented using ATM technology. The main requirement of a traffic management system is to optimise {{the use of the}} network so as to ensure that the network resources are used as efficiently as possible whilst allowing the customers (users) to enjoy the quality of service (QoS) they have been guaranteed. In effect it should ensure fairness and efficient use of resources. Because the <b>IBC</b> <b>network</b> is intended to transport many different services it must be able to cope with a multitude of connection types with differing requirements on connection establishment bandwidth attributes, Quality of Service and user behaviour. Many of these parameters are unknown today and will be unknown or changing during the operation of such network. In addition ATM technology provides a very flexible way of containing connections onto routes formed by virtual paths. This means that control functions of the network can not be fixed and be efficient for all time and so new traffic management functions are required to adapt the operating parameters of the network to changing requirements. The functions of traffic management will be to manage control function strategies. These strategies must be very simple since they will be very close to the hardware which will execute traffic management actions based on these strategies. The main function of these strategies is to attempt to do proactive / preventive management rather than reactive management. However reactive management does have a role in traffic management especially under network element failure conditions. These management functions could be provided by manual / established means, but due to the amount of information and the complexity of the mana [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Computational {{complexity}} has two goals: {{finding the}} inherent cost of some problem, and finding optimal algorithms for solving this problem. {{for which the}} available information is partial, contaminated by error, and priced. Examples of such problems include integration, approximation, ordinary and partial di#erential equations, integral equations, and the solution of nonlinear problems such as root-finding and optimization. In this talk, we give {{a brief overview of}} ibc. We focus mainly on the integration problem (which is a simple, yet important, problem {{that can be used to}} illustrate the <b>main</b> ideas of <b>ibc)</b> and the approximation problem (which will be of most interest to specialists in learning theory). One important issue that we discuss is the "curse of dimension" [...] -the depressing fact that the worst case complexity of many problems depends exponentially on dimension, rendering them intractable. We explore ibc-based techniques for vanquishing the curse of dimension. In particular, we find that randomization beats intractability for the integration problem but not for the approximation problem; on the other hand, both these problems are tractable in the average case setting under a Wiener sheet measure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractâIntrabody {{communication}} (IBC) {{is a new}} way {{of transferring}} data using human body as a medium. Minute current can travel though human body without any harm. IBC can remove electrical wires for human area <b>network.</b> <b>IBC</b> can be also a secure communication network system unlike wireless networks which can be accessed by anyone with bad intentions. One of the IBC systems is based on frequency shift keying modulation where individual data are transmitted to the external devices for the purpose of secure access such as digital door lock. It was found that the quality of IBC data transmission was heavily dependent on ground configurations of electronic circuits. Reliable IBC transmissions were not possible when both of the transmitter and receiver used batteries as circuit power source. Transmission was reliable when power supplies were used as power source for both transmitting and receiving sites because the common ground was established through the grounds of instruments such as power supply and oscilloscope. This was due to transmission dipole size and the ground effects of floor and AC power line. If one site used battery as power source and the other site used the AC power as circuit power source, transmission was possible.

40|$|Hypothesis: "Up-front" surgery {{improves}} {{survival in}} inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). Design Retrospective cohort, 1985 - 2003. Setting Tertiary referral center. Patients Consecutive {{patients with a}} primary occurrence of <b>IBC.</b> <b>Main</b> Outcome Measures All-cause and disease-free survival. Results: One-hundred fifty-six patients were identified with IBC; 28 patients with metastatic disease were excluded from further analysis. The {{mean age of the}} remaining 128 patients was 53 years; 57 % of women were postmenopausal. One hundred twenty-two patients had clinically apparent IBC. Tumors were palpable in 83 patients (mean diameter, 9. 1 cm). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was the initial therapy in 106 patients, while surgery was the initial therapy in 22 patients. The overall median survival was 37 months, with a median disease-free interval of 23 months. The 5 -year survival was 42 %, with a disease-free survival of 21 %. Univariate analysis of recurrence identified previous hormone therapy (relative risk [RR], 0. 50; P = 3 D. 03), menopause (RR, 0. 55; P = 3 D. 01), and palpable adenopathy (RR, 1. 57; P = 3 D. 04) as significant factors. Univariate survival analysis highlighted previous hormone therapy (RR, 0. 48; P = 3 D. 04), radiotherapy (RR, 0. 39; P = 3 D. 02), sequence of therapy (P = 3 D. 001), family history (RR, 0. 47; P = 3 D. 01), and palpable adenopathy (RR, 2. 22; P<. 001) as being important. Multivariate analysis of recurrence identified menopausal status as the key factor. Adenopathy at the initial examination was associated with decreased length of survival, while radiotherapy was associated with better survival. Conclusions: Survival from IBC remains poor. Although adenopathy and radiotherapy affected survival by multivariate analysis, the sequence of therapy was not associated with improved outcome...|$|R
