40|$|A {{safety relief}} valve has been {{developed}} {{in order to protect}} the cold masses of LHC against overpressure while the magnets undergo resistive transition. The valve ensures fast discharge of helium into a separate cryogenic line. The closed valve isolates the static superfluid helium of the cold masses to the separate cryogenic line with a <b>minimum</b> <b>leak</b> rate of less than 0. 01 g/s. The valve has a protection device so that the tightness is not reduced by solid particles (from the magnets) in the helium. The Safety Relief Valve can be switched between two operating modes with a set pressure of 12 bar or 20 bar respectively. The main parts of the valve, such as poppet, seat and spindle, are exchangeable under cold conditions. First measurements and tests have already been carried out.

40|$|Gas leak {{detection}} {{is an important}} issue in infrastructure monitoring and industrial production. In this context, infrared (IR) absorption spectroscopy is a major measurement method. It can be applied in an extractive or remote detection scheme. Tunable laser spectroscopy (TLS) instruments are able to detect CH 4 leaks with column densities below 10 ppm·m from a distance of 30 m in less than a second. However, {{leak detection}} of non-IR absorbing gases such as N 2 is not possible in this manner. Due to the fact that any leaking gas displaces or dilutes the surrounding background gas, an indirect detection is still possible. It is shown by sensitive TLS measurements of the ambient background concentration of O 2 that N 2 leaks can be localized with extractive and standoff methods for distances below 1 m. <b>Minimum</b> <b>leak</b> rates of 0. 1 mbar·L/s were determined. Flow simulations confirm that the leakage gas typically effuses in a narrow jet. The sensitivity is mainly determined by ambient flow conditions. Compared to TLS detection of CH 4 at 1651 nm, the indirect method using O 2 at 761 nm is experimentally found to be less sensitive by a factor of 100. However, the well-established TLS of O 2 may become a universal tool for rapid leakage screening of vessels that contain unknown or inexpensive gases, such as N 2...|$|E
40|$|Respirators {{are used}} to {{minimize}} the exposure to air contaminants. A good fit {{is essential for the}} effective functioning of a respirator. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires an annual respirator fit testing. Respirator fit can be assessed either qualitatively or quantitatively. Two studies were conducted to assess the fit testing program with specific objectives to: (1) assess leak rates in full and half mask respirators; (2) assess the effectiveness of "feedback" 1 on the quality of fit; (3) evaluate the effect of daily beard growth on respirator leak rates. In the first study, {{it was found that the}} half mask respirator has a significantly lower leak rate than the full face respirator. A significant reduction in leak rate in both respirator types with "feedback" was also observed. The finding that half mask respirators have lower leak rates directly contradicts American National Standard Institute's (ANSI) guidelines of higher Assigned Protection Factor (APF) for full mask respirator. Further studies are necessary to determine these findings and to amend respirator recommendations in the future. As expected in the second study, beard growth was associated with respirator leak rate. The effect of daily growth on leak rate over a period of twelve days could be defined by a second order regression equation. An attempt was made to describe some characteristics of beard that affect the leak rate. After 12 days of beard growth, it was found that the aspect ratio (length/diameter) of hair was inversely correlated with leak rate (r = 0. 64). 1 Feedback: A numerical value measuring the <b>minimum</b> <b>leak</b> rate that can be gotten from a respirator fitting with a normal donning...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAtmospheric CO 2 {{perturbations}} from simulated leaks {{have been}} used to determine the minimum statistically significant emissions that can be detected above background concentrations using a single atmospheric station. The study uses high precision CO 2 measurements from the Arcturus atmospheric monitoring station in the Bowen Basin, Australia. A statistical model of the observed CO 2 signal was constructed, combining both a regression and a time series model. A non-parametric goodness of fit approach using the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff (KS) test was then used to test whether simulated perturbations can be detected against the modelled expected value of the background for certain hours of the day and for particular seasons. The KS test calculates the probability that the modelled leak perturbation could be caused by natural variation in the background. Using pre-whitened data and selecting optimum test conditions, <b>minimum</b> detectable <b>leaks</b> located 1 km from the measurement station were estimated at 22 tpd for an area source of size 100 m x 100 m and 14 tpd for a point source at a KS cutoff defined by using the formal p-value of 0. 05. These are very large leaks located only 1 km from the station and have a high false alarm rate of 56 %. An alternative p-value could be chosen to reduce the false alarm rate but then the <b>minimum</b> detectable <b>leaks</b> are larger. A long term, single measurement station monitoring program that is unconstrained by prior information on the possible direction or magnitude of a leak, and based solely on detection of perturbations of CO 2 due to leakage above a (naturally noisy) background signal, is likely to take one or more years to detect leaks of the order of 10 kt p. a. The sensitivity of detection of a leak above a background signal could be greatly improved through the installation of additional atmospheric monitoring stations or through greater prior knowledge about the location and size of a suspected leak...|$|R
40|$|Low-temperature {{electronic}} systems require electrical leads which have low electrical resistance to provide bias current I without excessive voltage drop V. But proper cryogenic design also requires high thermal resistance {{to maintain a}} <b>minimum</b> heat <b>leak</b> Q from the hot temperature T[hot] to the cold temperature T[cold]. By the Wiedemann-Franz law, these requirements are in direct conflict, and the optimal configuration takes a particularly simple universal approximate form for the common case that T[cold] << T[hot]: Q/I = V = 3. 6 kT[hot]/e. This is applied here to the cryopackaging of RSFQ superconducting circuits on a 4 K cryocooler, but is equally applicable to other cryogenic systems such as a superconducting sensor array at low and ultra-low temperatures.

40|$|AbstractThe {{leak before break}} (LBB) {{concept is}} widely used in {{designing}} pipe lines in nuclear power plants. According to the concept, the amount of leaking liquid from a pipe should be more than the <b>minimum</b> detectable <b>leak</b> rate of a leak detection system before catastrophic failure occurs. Therefore, accurate estimation of the leak rate is important to evaluate {{the validity of the}} LBB concept in pipe line design. In this paper, a program was developed to estimate the leak rate through circumferential cracks in pipes in nuclear power plants using the Henry–Fauske flow model and modified Henry–Fauske flow model. By using the developed program, the leak rate was calculated for a circumferential crack in a sample pipe, and the effect of the flow model on the leak rate was examined. Treating the crack morphology parameters as random variables, the statistical behavior of the leak rate was also examined. As a result, {{it was found that the}} crack morphology parameters have a strong effect on the leak rate and the statistical behavior of the leak rate can be simulated using normally distributed crack morphology parameters...|$|R

We aimed to compare the clinical performance of the classic LMA with the PLMA. Several studies comparing these two devices have been done. Our {{study was designed to}} compare ease of insertion, airway sealing pressure, and fiber-optic assessment of positioning in adult patients, and we hopes to prove that PLMA is better to LMA in all these aspects. We hypothesized that PLMA would have a better leak pressure than the CLMA and <b>minimum</b> difference in <b>leak</b> pressure of 20 % between them was considered clinically significant. Material and methodsOne hundred adult patients of either sex between age group of 18 – 65 years scheduled for elective surgery were included in the study. Patients were randomly allocated to two groups of 50 patients each. In group I CLMA and in group II PLMA were used. The number of attempts, ease of insertion, time of insertion, and failure if occurred were noted down. Hemodynamic changes, airway sealing pressure, and the fiber-optic were also recorded. ResultsData thus compiled showed that insertion was successful in first attempt in 94 % cases with LMA as well as PLMA. The time taken for successful placement of LMA and - PLMA was 15 and 17 s, respectively. Sealing pressure was higher for group II at all cuff volumes. More number of patients (89 %) in group II had a fiber optic score of I and II as compared to group I which had 81 % patients with score I and II. ConclusionWe conclude that PLMA is easy to insert with a short insertion time, high success of placement at first attempt, and capable of achieving a more effective seal than LMA...|$|R
40|$|Hermeticity is {{a measure}} of how well a package can {{maintain}} its intended ambient cavity environment over the device lifetime. Since many Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) sensors, actuators and microelectronic devices require a known cavity environment for optimum operational performance, {{it is important to know}} the leak rate of the package for lifetime prediction purposes. In this field, limitations in the traditional leak detection methods and standards used originally for integrated circuits and semiconductors have been blindly and often incorrectly applied to MEMS and microelectronic packages. The aim of this project is to define accurately the limitations of the existing hermeticity test methods and standards when applied to low cavity volume MEMS and microelectronic packages and to demonstrate novel test methods, which are applicable to such packages. For the first time, the use of the Lambert-W function has been demonstrated to provide a closed form expression of the maximum true leak rate achievable for the most commonly used existing hermeticity test method, the helium fine leak test. This expression along with the <b>minimum</b> detectable <b>leak</b> rate expression is shown to provide practical guidelines for the accurate testing of hermeticity for ultra-low volume packages. The three leak types which MEMS and microelectronic packages are subject to: molecular leaks, permeation and outgassing, are explained in detail and it is found that the helium leak test is capable of quantifying only molecular leak in packages with cavity volumes exceeding 2. 6 mm 3. With many MEMS and microelectronic package containing cavities with lower volumes, new hermeticity test methods are required to fill this gap and to measure the increasingly lower leak rates which adversely affect such packages. Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy are investigated as methods of detecting gas pressure within MEMS and microelectronics packages. Measured over time, FTIR can be used to determine the molecular and permeation leak rates of packages containing infra-red transparent cap materials. Future work is required to achieve an adequate signal to noise ratio to enable Raman spectroscopy to be a quantitative method to determine molecular leaks, permeation leaks and potentially outgassing. The design, fabrication and calibration procedure for three in-situ test structures intended to monitor the hermeticity of packages electrically are also presented. The calibration results of a piezoresistive cap deflection test structure show the structure can be used to detect leak ii rates of any type down to 6. 94 × 10 - 12 atm. cm 3. s- 1. A portfolio of hermeticity test methods is also presented outlining the limitations and advantages of each method. This portfolio is intended to be a living document and should be updated as new research is undertaken and new test methods developed...|$|R
