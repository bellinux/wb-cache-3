40|$|Control Rod Drive Mechanism (CRDM) {{based on}} {{stepping}} motor {{is one of}} the components applied in High Temperature Gas Coold Reactor (HTGR) to control the reactivity as well as to maintain the safety of reactor. The stepping motor requires a unique condition monitoring to avoid any failures especially due to the specific environments of CRDM in HTGR such as the allowable of high temperature, high radiation and the location of stepper motor inside a pressure shell. This research aims to demonstrate an online non-invasive condition monitoring method without direct access to the CRDM of HTGR based on voltage and stator current measurements. A simple stepping motor CRDM simulator is employed. The online condition monitoring is carried out by direct pattern matching of the output signals of logic generator block and the output signals of motor driver. The online method utilizes signature patterns of voltage and stator current signals of the healthy motor as a baseline for healthy motor. In addition, the method is applied to detect high-resistance problem on the connector between the motor driver block and the stepper motor to show the effectiveness and the applicability of this method. The online condition monitoring system demonstrates a capability to identify a minimum detectable simulated high-resistance for about 2. 9 % which decreases the measured stator current and motor’s torque for around 5. 1 % and 3. 3 %, respectively. The paper also points out signatures of healthy motor, including <b>mutual</b> <b>inductions</b> of the motor’s winding in voltage and current measurement which can be used as the fault symptom indicators for online monitoring purposes...|$|R
40|$|SYNOPSIS. In {{simplest}} terms, {{the complexity}} of the metazoan body arises through various combinations of but two tissue types: epithelium and mesenchyme. Through <b>mutual</b> <b>inductions</b> and interactions, these tissues produce all of the organs of the body. Of the two, epithelium must be considered the default type in the Eumetazoa because it arises first in embryonic development and because mesenchyme arises from it by a switching off of the mechanisms that underly differentiation and maintenance of epithelial cells. In the few model metazoans whose epithelia have been studied by molecular techniques (largely Drosophila, Caeno-rhabditis, mouse), the molecular mechanisms underlying differentiation of epithelia show remarkable simi-larity. Extrapolating from these studies and from comparisons of the morphology of epithelia in lower metazoans, I propose how epithelia arose in the stem metazoan. Steps in epithelial differentiation include 1) establishment of cell polarity by molecular markers confined to either apical or basolateral domains in the plasma membrane; 2) aggregation of cells into sheets by localization of cell-adhesion molecules like cadherin to the lateral membrane; 3) formation of a zonula adherens junction from the cadherins by their localization to a discrete belt; 4) cell-to-cell linking of certain transmembrane proteins (primitively in the septate junc-tion) to produce gates that physiologically isolate compartments delimited by the cells; and 5) synthesis of a basal lamina and adaptation of receptors (integrins) to its components. Despite morphological differences in the variety of cell junctions evident in various epithelia, the underlying molecular markers of these junctions are probably universally present in all eumetazoan epithelia...|$|R

In order to illustrate and compare the {{formation and}} downstream development of wingtip vortices, the analyses were conducted for two widely-different cases of spanwise distribution of bound-vorticity. Termed inboard and outboard distributions, the loadings were nearly triangular and rectangular, respectively. For development analysis, Biot-Savart field calculations were conducted for the induced velocity field, and hence displacement {{of the elements of}} the shed vorticity sheet. Although an induced field calculation does not represent all fluid-element forces (in particular, the expansion pressure field) and thus, might over-estimate core radius for example), the comparative calculations provided results of interest, regarding the properties of developed wingtip vortices, such as core radius, span location, core asymmetry and peak velocity location. Following this and with reference to the NRC flight measurements of small, intense vortex elements with peaks greater than potential vortex peaks, centrifugal stability analysis is conducted, using a number of models: (1) the developed vortices for the outboard loading case were stimulated with, and released from, radial forcing; (2) a physical model of the centrifugal balance between inertia and pressure forces was examined by time-wise solution of the equations of elemental equations of motion, and (3) the Euler equations in axisymmetric, cylindrical coordinate form were numerically, spatiotemporally solved for excess-velocity vortex profiles.

40|$|Business {{transactions}} involve {{multiple partners}} coordinating and interacting with each other. These transactions have hierarchies of activities which {{need to be}} orchestrated. Usual database approaches (e. g.,checkpoint, rollback) are not applicable to handle faults in a long running transaction due to interaction with multiple partners. The compensation mechanism handles faults that can arise in a long running transaction. Based on the framework of Hoare's CSP process algebra, Butler et al introduced Compensating CSP (cCSP), a language to model long-running transactions. The language introduces a method to declare a transaction as a process and it has constructs for orchestration of compensation. Butler et al also defines a trace semantics for cCSP. In this thesis, the semantic models of compensating CSP are extended by defining an operational semantics, describing how the state of a program changes during its execution. The semantics is encoded into Prolog to animate the specification. The semantic models are further extended to define the synchronisation of processes. The notion of partial behaviour is defined to model the behaviour of deadlock that arises during process synchronisation. A correspondence relationship is then defined between the semantic models and proved by using structural induction. Proving the correspondence means {{that any of the}} presentation can be accepted as a primary definition of the meaning of the language and each definition can be used correctly at different times, and for different purposes. The semantic models and their relationships are mechanised by using the theorem prover PVS. The semantic models are embedded in PVS by using Shallow embedding. The relationships between semantic models are proved by <b>mutual</b> structural <b>induction.</b> The mechanisation overcomes the problems in hand proofs and improves the scalability of the approach.

We provide general formal tools for certifying formula-based Noetherian induction proofs by the Coq proof assistant, then show how to apply them to certify proofs of conjectures about conditional specifications, built with: i) a reductive rewrite-based induction system, and ii) a reductive-free cyclic induction system. The generation of reductive proofs and their certification process can be easily automatised, without requiring additional definitions or proof transforma- tions, but may involve many ordering constraints to be checked during the certification process. On the other hand, the reductive-free proofs generate fewer ordering constraints, may involve more general specifications and the certification process is more effective. However, their proof generation is less automatic and the generated proofs need to be normalised before being certi- fied. The methodology for certifying reductive-free cyclic induction proofs related to conditional specifications extends a previous approach used for implicit induction proofs {{and it can be}} easily adapted to certify any formula-based Noetherian induction reasoning.

40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{simulations}} {{can be very}} computationally expensive, {{especially for}} Large Eddy Simulations (LES) and Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of turbulent flows. In LES the large, energy containing eddies are resolved by the computational mesh, but the smaller (sub-grid) scales are modeled. In DNS, all scales of turbulence are resolved, including the smallest dissipative (Kolmogorov) scales. Clusters of CPUs have been the standard approach for such simulations, but an emerging approach {{is the use of}} Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), which deliver impressive computing performance compared to CPUs. Recently there has been great interest in the scientific computing community to use GPUs for general-purpose computation (such as the numerical solution of PDEs) rather than graphics rendering. To explore the use of GPUs for CFD simulations, an incompressible Navier-Stokes solver was developed for a GPU. This solver is capable of simulating unsteady laminar flows or performing a LES or DNS of turbulent flows. The Navier-Stokes equations are solved via a fractional-step method and are spatially discretized using the finite volume method on a Cartesian mesh. An immersed boundary method based on a ghost cell treatment was developed to handle flow past complex geometries. The implementation of these numerical methods had to suit the architecture of the GPU, which is designed for massive multithreading. The details of this implementation will be described, along with strategies for performance optimization. Validation of the GPU-based solver was performed for fundamental bench-mark problems, and a performance assessment indicated that the solver was over an order-of-magnitude faster compared to a CPU. The GPU-based Navier-Stokes solver was used to study film-cooling flows via Large Eddy Simulation. In modern gas turbine engines, the film-cooling method is used to protect turbine blades from hot combustion gases. Therefore, understanding the physics of this problem as well as techniques to improve it is important. Fundamentally, a film-cooling configuration is an inclined cooling jet in a hot cross-flow. A known problem in the film-cooling method is jet lift-off, where the jet of coolant moves away from the surface to be cooled due to <b>mutual</b> vortex <b>induction</b> by the counter-rotating vortex pair embedded in the jet, resulting in decreased cooling at the surface. To counteract this, a micro-ramp vortex generator was added downstream of the film-cooling jet, which generated near-wall counter-rotating vortices of opposite sense to the vortex pair in the jet. It was found that the micro-ramp vortices created a downwash effect toward the wall, which helped entrain coolant from the jet and transport it to the wall, resulting in better cooling. Results are reported using two film-cooling configurations, where the primary difference is the way the jet exit boundary conditions are prescribed. In the first configuration, the jet is prescribed using a precursor simulation and in the second the jet is modeled using a plenum/pipe configuration. The latter configuration was designed based on previous wind tunnel experiments at NASA Glenn Research Center, and the present results were meant to supplement those experiments...|$|R
