5|$|Artificial {{climbing}} {{walls are}} used to simulate boulder problems in an indoor environment, usually at climbing gyms. These walls are constructed with wooden panels, polymer cement panels, concrete shells, or precast molds of actual rock walls. Holds, usually made of plastic, are then bolted onto the wall to create problems. The walls often feature steep overhanging surfaces, forcing the climber to employ highly technical movements while supporting <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> weight with their upper body strength.|$|E
5|$|Bears have {{a fairly}} simple {{digestive}} system typical for carnivorans, with a single stomach, short undifferentiated intestines and no cecum. Even the herbivorous giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut. Bears must spend <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> time feeding {{in order to gain}} enough nutrition from foliage. The panda, in particular, spends 12–15 hours a day feeding.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the crusade, the {{countryside}} of Mecklenburg and Pomerania was plundered and depopulated with much bloodshed, especially by the troops of Henry the Lion.

5|$|California {{sea lions}} have a {{polygynous}} breeding pattern. From May to August, males establish territories {{and try to}} attract females with which to mate. Females are free to move in between territories, and are not coerced by males. Mothers nurse their pups in between foraging trips. Sea lions communicate with numerous vocalizations, notably with barks and mother-pup contact calls. Outside their breeding season, sea lions spend <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> time at sea, but they come to shore to molt.|$|E

5|$|Each clan has a {{specified}} area {{of land that}} all members contribute to foraging from and defending. Frequently, territory sizes, normally , are correlated with the abundance of rain and resources in a region; smaller territories occur where insects and resources are plentiful. Additionally, the feeding territories are larger {{during the winter months}} when these birds spend <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> time foraging with the entire clan. White-winged fairywrens occupy much larger territories than other fairywren species.|$|E

5|$|In 2006 it was {{estimated}} that there were 10,000 foxes in London.

Books were rare and very expensive and likely only possessed by teachers who dictated passages to students.|$|E
