5|$|Apple {{began taking}} pre-orders for the first-generation iPad on March 12, 2010. The only major {{change to the}} device between its {{announcement}} and being available to pre-order was the change {{of the behavior of}} the side switch to perform either sound <b>muting</b> or screen rotation locking (user selectable). The Wi-Fi version of the iPad went on sale in the United States on April 3, 2010. The Wi-Fi+3G version was released on April 30. 3G service in the United States is provided by AT and was initially sold with two prepaid contract-free data plan options: one for unlimited data and the other for 250MB per month at half the price. On June 2, 2010, AT announced that effective June 7 the unlimited plan would be replaced for new customers with a 2GB plan at slightly lower cost; existing customers would have the option to keep the unlimited plan. The plans are activated on the iPad itself and can be cancelled at any time.|$|E
25|$|Muffling {{is often}} {{referred}} to as <b>muting,</b> which can also refer to playing with mutes on them (see below).|$|E
25|$|The {{temperature}} that a wine {{is served}} at can greatly {{affect the way}} it tastes and smells. Lower temperatures will emphasize acidity and tannins while <b>muting</b> the aromatics. Higher temperatures will minimize acidity and tannins while increasing the aromatics.|$|E
50|$|Practice <b>mutes,</b> {{also known}} as Whispa, whisper, or hotel <b>mutes,</b> are similar to {{straight}} <b>mutes</b> in appearance, but have a solid ring of cork that prevents air from escaping from the bell like a Harmon <b>mute.</b> There are sound baffles inside the <b>mute,</b> and tiny holes in {{the sides of the}} <b>mute</b> that allow air to escape silently. These <b>mutes</b> are extremely quiet and are rarely used in performance. They are usually used for privacy and to avoid disturbing bystanders during practice sessions.|$|R
50|$|Cup <b>Mute</b> - The cup <b>mute</b> is a <b>mute</b> {{that sticks}} {{to the inside of}} the brass bell, and {{completely}} covers it with its distinct cup shape. This specific <b>mute</b> gives a sound similar to that of a full cover plunger <b>mute.</b> Typical use during smoother and lyrical jazz playing.|$|R
50|$|The {{second most}} common brass <b>mute</b> is the cup <b>mute.</b> Cup <b>mutes</b> are similar to {{straight}} <b>mutes,</b> but have a cup portion attached {{to the end of}} the <b>mute's</b> cone. This allows the sound to bounce back towards the instrument bell before making its way through the gap between the cup and bell, producing a more muffled darker tone. Traditionally, cup <b>mutes</b> are made from fiber materials and have a very distinctive sound. Cup <b>mutes</b> can be made from metal, plastic or fiber materials. Some metal cup <b>mutes</b> have an adjustable cup portion which can be moved towards or away from the brass instrument bell to further color the tone. Newer cup <b>mutes</b> now offer an adjustable cup portion although made from a fiber composite material, allowing the user to adjust the cup while preserving the traditional cup <b>mute</b> sound.|$|R

25|$|The Virtual Machine console is {{replaced}} by an integrated Virtual Machines shell folder. Several options from the console have been removed such as Restore at start, CPU time performance settings, <b>muting</b> sound in inactive virtual machines, full-screen resolution related options, configuring the host key, mouse capture options and settings for requiring administrator permissions.|$|E
25|$|On the {{recorded}} version, Borland played without a guitar pick, performing with two hands, one playing melodic notes, {{and the other}} playing chord progressions. Borland's playing featured octave shapes, and choppy, eighth-note rhythms, sometimes accompanied by <b>muting</b> his strings with his left hand, creating a percussive sound. Borland also made use of unevenly accented syncopated sixteenth notes and hypnotic, droning licks to create a disorienting effect.|$|E
5000|$|The Wah-wah <b>mute</b> (also {{known by}} the brand name Harmon) is a hollow, bulbous <b>mute</b> in two parts. Unlike the more common {{straight}} or cup <b>mutes,</b> the Harmon <b>mute</b> has a solid ring of cork that completely blocks the air leaving the bell, forcing all of it into the <b>mute.</b> At {{the front of the}} <b>mute,</b> there is a cup on a tube (sometimes called the [...] "stem") that can be slid in or out, or removed completely, depending on the composer's direction or the player's preference. This <b>mute</b> produces a tinny, shallow sound which can be varied by adjusting the <b>mute</b> and via manipulation with the fingers at the cup end. Harmon <b>mutes</b> are commonly used only on trumpets and trombones.|$|R

50|$|Attaching a small metal, rubber, leather, or wooden {{device called}} a <b>mute,</b> or sordino, {{to the bridge}} of the violin gives a softer, more mellow tone, with fewer audible overtones; the sound of an entire orchestral string section playing with <b>mutes</b> has a hushed quality. The {{conventional}} Italian markings for <b>mute</b> usage are con sord., or con sordina, meaning 'with mute'; and senza sord., meaning 'without mute'; or via sord., meaning 'mute off'. Larger metal, rubber, or wooden <b>mutes</b> are widely available, known as practice <b>mutes</b> or hotel <b>mutes.</b> Such <b>mutes</b> are generally not used in performance, but are used to deaden the sound of the violin in practice areas such as hotel rooms. (For practicing purposes there is also the <b>mute</b> violin, a violin without a sound box.) Some composers have used practice <b>mutes</b> for special effect, for example, at the end of Luciano Berio's Sequenza VIII for solo violin.|$|R
25|$|Resonance {{can cause}} timpani {{not in use}} to vibrate, causing a quieter sound to be produced. Timpanists must {{normally}} avoid this effect, called sympathetic resonance, but composers have exploited it in solo pieces such as Elliott Carter's Eight Pieces for Four Timpani. Resonance is reduced by dampening or <b>muting</b> the drums, {{and in some cases}} composers will specify that timpani be played con sordino (with mute) or coperti (covered), both of which indicate that mutes—typically small pieces of felt or leather—should be placed on the head.|$|E
25|$|Death metal is {{an extreme}} subgenre of heavy metal music. It {{typically}} employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm <b>muting</b> and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of that year, someone stole a master tape of a rough draft of the album from one of Gaye's {{traveling}} musicians, Frank Blair, taking the master tape to Motown's Hollywood headquarters. Motown remixed the album and released it on January 15, 1981. When Gaye learned of its release, he accused Motown of editing and remixing the album without his consent, allowing the release of an unfinished production (Far Cry), altering the album art of his request and removing the album title's question mark, <b>muting</b> its irony. He also accused the label of rush-releasing the album, comparing his unfinished album to an unfinished Picasso painting. Gaye then vowed not to record any more music for Motown.|$|E

50|$|Double bass players use various {{accessories}} to {{help them}} to perform and rehearse. Three types of <b>mutes</b> are used in orchestral music: a wooden <b>mute</b> that slides onto the bridge, a rubber <b>mute</b> that attaches to the bridge and a wire device with brass weights that fits onto the bridge. The player uses the <b>mute</b> when the Italian instruction con sordino ("with mute") appears in the bass part, and removes it {{in response to the}} instruction senza sordino ("without mute"). With the <b>mute</b> on, the tone of the bass is quieter, darker, and more somber. Bowed bass parts with a <b>mute</b> can have a nasal tone. Players use a third type of <b>mute,</b> a heavy rubber practice <b>mute,</b> to practice quietly without disturbing others (e.g., in a hotel room).|$|R

25|$|The second {{appointment}} was of Lieutenant-General S.M. Abbasi {{who was appointed}} Martial Law Administrator of Sindh Province; his tenure too saw civil disorder amid student riots. By contrast, third martial law administrator appointment of Lieutenant-General Ghulam Jilani Khan to the Punjab Province made much headway in beautifying Lahore extending infrastructure, and <b>muting</b> political opposition. The ascent of Navaz Sharif to Chief Minister of Punjab was largely due to General Jilani's sponsorship. Perhaps most crucially, final and fourth martial law administrator {{appointment was}} then-Lieutenant-General Rahimuddin Khan. Lieutenant-General Rahimuddin Khan {{was appointed to the}} post of Martial Law Administrator of Balochistan Province saw the disbanding of the Baloch insurgency, the containment of Afghan Mujahideen, as well as the construction of nuclear test sites in the Chagai District.|$|E
25|$|The provincial {{martial law}} Administrator of Punjab Province, Lieutenant-General Ghulam Jilani Khan {{sponsored}} {{the government of}} Nawaz Sharif, and Sharif built his ties with the senior army generals who would remain supportive and sponsored Sharif's ministership. General Jilani Khan made much headway in beautifying Lahore, extending military infrastructure, and <b>muting</b> political opposition, while Sharif maintained the {{law and order in}} the province, expanded the economical infrastructure that not only benefited the army and himself but also the people of Punjab province. In 1988, General Zia dismissed the government of hand-picked Prime minister Muhammad Khan Junejo, and called for new elections. However, with all the provisional and the national assemblies were dissolved, General Zia-ul-Haq retained Sharif as the Chief Minister of Punjab Province, and continued Sharif's support until his death and the elections were held in 1988.|$|E
25|$|Stating the {{efficiency}} of wind noise reduction is an inexact science, since the effect varies enormously with frequency, and hence with the bandwidth of the microphone and audio channel. At very low frequencies (10–100Hz) where massive wind energy exists, reductions are important to avoid overloading of the audio chain – particularly the early stages. This can produce the typical “wumping” sound associated with wind, which is often syllabic <b>muting</b> of the audio due to LF peak limiting. At higher frequencies – 200Hz to ~3kHz – the aural sensitivity curve allows us to hear the effect of wind as an addition to the normal noise floor, {{even though it has}} a far lower energy content. Simple shields may allow the wind noise to be 10dB less apparent; better ones can achieve nearer to a 50dB reduction. However the acoustic transparency, particularly at HF, should also be indicated, since a very high level of wind attenuation could be associated with very muffled audio.|$|E
50|$|Bucket <b>mutes</b> {{attach to}} {{the rim of the}} bell with springs and contain cotton, foam or a similar substance. The effect is removal of high {{frequencies}} and a soft, muffled tone. Some modern bucket <b>mutes</b> (by JoRal for example) are designed as oversized straight <b>mutes</b> filled with batting, with large holes in along the side. These are held in the bell of the instrument with strips of cork, like straight and cup <b>mutes.</b> Players often find a trade-off between spring-style <b>mutes,</b> which can prevent quick transitions and cone-shaped <b>mutes</b> that squeeze into the bell, which can cause back-pressure. Modernized flexible spring-style clips on bucket <b>mutes</b> make transitioning fast and also eliminate back-pressure.|$|R

25|$|Although {{reaction}} to the game's announcement satisfied the studio, they realized that its fast pace would make extensive use of the GamePad while <b>muting</b> the TV display's utility; players must focus on one screen while ignoring the other. The tiny monsters were problematic, since shooting them was unsatisfying. The issues were singled out by Ubisoft management at a Ubisoft Paris meeting, and the team decided to slow the game's pace. The enemies were changed from small monsters to zombies, since their movement is slower and they are easily identified as monsters. According to Jean-Karl Tupin-Bron, the team was sorry to realize that Killer Freaks would not work but delighted {{by the results of}} the transition. By September 2011, most of the Killer Freaks team had joined the zombie-game team. During the transition, the game's tone became more serious. The team tried to distinguish itself from other zombie games in the video-game market, making the GamePad its central feature. They were inspired by the 2007 film, I Am Legend, in which the protagonist is the only survivor left in a city and must be constantly on guard against zombies. ZombiU, the game's working title, became its official name since it was a zombie game for Wii U.|$|E

500|$|The game's visuals were {{praised by}} reviewers. GamesRadar's Lorenzo Veloria opined that [...] "Adorable characters, {{beautiful}} visuals, and upbeat music {{stand out as}} the high points of Alien Spidy". A large number of reviewers called the game and its characters [...] "cute". While {{a few of the}} reviewers praised the game's music, Jeremy Peeples of Hardcore Gamer found that it lacked staying power. He noted, however, that the music could be muted without also <b>muting</b> the sound effects, allowing people to play their own music.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} type is the {{straight}} <b>mute,</b> a hollow, cone-shaped <b>mute</b> that fits into the bell of the instrument. This results in a more metallic, sometimes nasal sound, and when played at loud volumes {{can result in a}} very piercing note. Straight <b>mutes</b> have small pieces of cork attached to the end that squeeze against the inside of the bell and hold the <b>mute</b> in place. Straight <b>mutes</b> are available for all brass instruments, including the tuba.|$|R
5000|$|The solotone <b>mute</b> (labeled by Humes and Berg as the [...] "cleartone" [...] <b>mute),</b> {{also called}} a mega-mute, is {{shaped like a}} long {{straight}} <b>mute,</b> and includes sound baffles inside the <b>mute</b> that accentuate treble frequencies. It is rarely written for today but was common in jazz ensemble music written between 1930 and 1950. The most trademark use of the solo-tone <b>mute</b> was in Tommy Dorsey's trombone solo in [...] "Song of India", recorded January 1, 1937.|$|R
500|$|McCartney's {{skill as}} a bass player has been {{acknowledged}} by other bassists, including Sting, Dr. Dre bassist Mike Elizondo, and Colin Moulding of XTC. Best known for primarily using a plectrum or pick, McCartney occasionally plays fingerstyle. He {{does not use}} slapping or <b>muting</b> techniques. He was strongly influenced by Motown artists, in particular James Jamerson, who McCartney called a hero for his melodic style. He was also influenced by Brian Wilson, as he commented: [...] "because he went to very unusual places". Another favourite bassist of his is Stanley Clarke.|$|E
500|$|After release, {{the film}} was criticised for the usage of curse-words by the protagonist and a few {{intimate}} sequences between the lead pair. The <b>muting</b> of a few dialogues and blurring of a few visuals by the board were criticised by viewers. Bajrang Dal lodged a complaint with Municipal police on 14 January 2012 stating that the lyrics of the song [...] "We love Bad Boys" [...] contained vulgar words and conveyed an unacceptable meaning for which they demanded action against Jagannadh. The police confirmed this and stated they would seek legal opinions for taking further action.|$|E
500|$|Butterfield played Hohner harmonicas (and {{endorsed}} them). He {{preferred the}} diatonic ten-hole Marine Band model. He wrote a harmonica instruction book, Paul Butterfield Teaches Blues Harmonica Master Class, {{a few years}} before his death (it was not published until 1997). [...] In it, he explains various techniques, demonstrated on an accompanying CD. [...] Butterfield played mainly in cross-harp, or second position. He occasionally used a chromatic harmonica. Reportedly left-handed, he held the harmonica in a manner opposite that of a right-handed player, i.e., in his right hand, upside down (with the low notes to the right), using his left hand for <b>muting</b> effects.|$|E
50|$|Like all cornetts, the <b>mute</b> cornett was {{developed}} from the medieval cow horn with finger holes. The <b>mute</b> cornett seems to have come into prominence in the 16th century, although it certainly existed in the 15th century. Lists of instrumentations in performances of music, particularly the Florentine Intermedii, sometimes mention the use of <b>mute</b> cornetts. Lassus conducted performances of instrumental and vocal music in Munich, and descriptions of these concerts mention the use of <b>mute</b> cornetts. A painting of Lassus directing his musicians and singers shows both a regular cornett and a <b>mute</b> cornett. <b>Mute</b> cornetts were produced by makers in Venice in the 16th century and these instruments {{seem to have been}} exported to various cities in Europe. The <b>mute</b> cornett was popular in Italy around 1600, although the instrument was rarely specifically named by composers in their works. In Northern Europe, composers were more precise, and the <b>mute</b> cornett was specified by 17th-century composers such as Heinrich Schütz, Michael Praetorius and Johann Heinrich Schmelzer. In the early 18th century, the <b>mute</b> cornett seem to be becoming an increasingly rare instrument, however, Johann Joseph Fux composed a Requiem in 1720 which specified two <b>mute</b> cornetts.|$|R
