50|$|Ryan's Gig Guide is an {{independent}} incisive band friendly gig guide and music magazine based in The Black Country, England and distributed throughout the West Midlands United Kingdom. The printed publication {{is not just a}} list of gigs each <b>month,</b> but the <b>finger</b> on the pulse of the Birmingham and the Black Country music scene.|$|R
50|$|In 1989 {{he joined}} the {{contemporary}} saxophone quartet Itchy Fingers. The band toured Europe and South-East Asia for 18 <b>months.</b> With Itchy <b>Fingers</b> Hitchcock received three jazz awards: the Schlitz award for rising star, the Cleo Laine Personal Award for best young musician, and the Pat Smythe Trust award. He left the band to continue as a pop and session musician.|$|R
5000|$|Draper later {{revealed}} {{that he had been}} diagnosed with cancer during recording sessions at Rockfield Studios, after a blister appeared on his left hand middle finger that kept bleeding. He visited a local doctor who took a sample of tissue from the finger. It was confirmed that it was malignant and was known as a [...] "Bowenoid Malignancy," [...] and Draper responded positively to five cycles of chemotherapy. However, he was unable to play for several <b>months</b> after his <b>finger</b> swelled up following treatment ...|$|R
60|$|In the meantime, the horse-dealer, Nunez, {{went to a}} {{newspaper}} office, and there procured a file of a Mexican paper, for the negro had convinced them that his vessel had sailed from Acapulco. Turning over the back numbers week after week, and week after week, Nunez searched in the maritime news for the information that the Miranda had cleared from a Mexican port. He had gone back so far that {{he had begun to}} consider it useless to make further search, when suddenly he caught the name Miranda. There it was. The brig Miranda had cleared from Acapulco September 16, bound for Rio Janeiro in ballast. Nunez counted the <b>months</b> on his <b>fingers.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Blech {{was not so}} fortunate; his glider {{was later}} seen {{fluttering}} to the ground without its canopy and trailing a parachute bag, but {{a search of the}} wreckage found no trace of Blech, whose ice-coated body was soon found on the Wasserkuppe. When the barometer carried by the H.IIIc was checked the needle had left the trace area at 8,000 metres (26,250ft), the limit of the barometer's range, meaning the aircraft had exceeded this altitude. Examination of Blech's body revealed a broken nose and neck, pointing to a collision with either his own aircraft, or another, after he had abandoned the H.IIIc. [...] Scheidhauer recovered in hospital over the next six <b>months</b> losing two <b>fingers</b> of his right hand to frostbite.|$|R
50|$|The month {{started with}} two more losses, to Bath City and Hayes & Yeading, leaving the club in the relegation zone. This brought the run to four {{consecutive}} losses and forced the board to issue {{a vote of confidence}} in manager Martin Ling's management. This led to something of a renaissance in form - the club went unbeaten in the month's remaining four games, and won the last three, including a 3-0 home win against Lewes in the FA Cup Fourth Qualifying Round. Daryl Clare, who had struggled to find his old form since joining the club with just 1 goal in 13 appearances, was ruled out for 6 weeks {{at the end of the}} <b>month</b> with a <b>finger</b> injury.|$|R
40|$|A {{prospective}} study of 30 clinically and mycologically diagnosed cases of onychomycosis {{was carried out}} {{for a period of}} twelve months from May 1996 to April 1997. Itraconazole pulse therapy was given for the 1 st week followed by 3 week drug-free period, for 1 st 3 <b>months</b> for the <b>finger</b> nail cases and 4 monthes for finger nail &#x 002 B; toe nail and toe nail cases. Patients were evaluated at baseline, week 4, week 12, week 16, week 24, up to 12 months and assessed as cleared or markedly improved with clinical and mycological success. The result of our study is very much encouraging. It suggests that the use of itraconazole pulse therapy will maintain the continuous treatment efficacy and is cost effective than continuous therapy...|$|R
40|$|Posterior {{interosseous}} nerve palsy {{caused by}} a ganglion is not common and most previous patients were treated with excisional surgery. We treated a case conservatively with needle aspiration using ultrasonography, after a nerve conduction study. A 77 -year-old man presented with impaired active finger extension of the left metacarpophalangeal joints. The nerve conduction study revealed conduction block of the left radial nerve near the elbow. Ultrasonography demonstrated a hypoechoic mass anterior to the radial neck compressing the posterior interosseous nerve. Then, needle aspiration of the mass was conducted under ultrasonography. Two <b>months</b> later, active <b>finger</b> extension recovered to normal. A ganglion can be diagnosed with ultrasonography and needle aspiration {{can be carried out}} safely under ultrasonography. A nerve conduction study can assess the degree of nerve damage. The combination of ultrasonography and a nerve conduction study can facilitate conservative treatment of needle aspiration for posterior interosseous nerve palsy {{caused by a}} ganglion...|$|R
40|$|Juvenile {{localized}} scleroderma (JLS) {{is a rare}} chronic inflammatory and fibrosing disorder. It {{can result}} in significant morbidity, disfigurement, and severe functional, aesthetic and psychological disabilities. Patients with JLS should be identified early, evaluated extensively, treated aggressively, and monitored carefully. Here {{the case of a}} 2 year old boy is reported who was admitted into the department of Paediatrics of Delta Medical College & Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh with painful swelling of all fingers of both hands for 6 months and blackish patches over the fingers for the last one and half <b>months.</b> Left little <b>finger</b> was the first finger affected and there was flexion contracture of both left little and index fingers. The boy was diagnosed as a case of juvenile localized scleroderma and was confirmed by skin biopsy. We treated the child with methotrexate and prednisolone. It is very essential to raise awareness about this disease among clinicians and also parents for early diagnosis and treatment...|$|R
40|$|Background: Osteoblastoma is an {{aggressive}} benign tumor whose presentation varies with location and size. This rare bone tumor is thus difficult to diagnose {{particularly when it}} occurs outside its most common location â€“ the vertebral column and long bones. Case: We report a case of osteoblastoma of the fourth distal phalanx of the left hand in an 18 -year-old male, presented with pain and swelling and treated with curettage and polymethylmethacrylate filling followed by immobilization by a cast, which was opened 10 days later to start physical therapy. Patient was pain-free, recovered full function of his finger, and remained without pain at one <b>month</b> post-surgery. The <b>finger</b> was monitored closely for two years; sequential films showed a radiopaque interface and no evidence of local recurrence. Conclusion: This is the first report of osteoblastoma on the distal phalanx. The possibility of osteoblastoma {{should be considered in}} cases of pain and swelling of phalanx, and if diagnosed, curettage and polymethylmethacrylate filling may be the treatment of choice...|$|R
40|$|Four short, simple {{measures}} of arm function, {{suitable for use}} with patients recovering from acute stroke, are described. These tests are: the Frenchay Arm Test, the Nine Hole Peg Test, finger tapping rate and grip strength. Good interobserver and test-retest reliability was demonstrated for all tests, and the Frenchay Arm Test was shown to be valid. Normal values for all tests were established on 63 controls. It {{was found that the}} limited sensitivity of the Frenchay Arm Test could be improved using the Nine Hole Peg Test and grip strength. Recovery of arm function has been studied in a sample of 56 patients seen regularly over the first 3 months after their stroke, using these standard measures. The results demonstrated a wide variation in recovery curves between patients. The use of the Nine Hole Peg Test enabled further recovery to be detected after patients achieved a top score on the Frenchay Arm Test. Failure to recover measureable grip strength before 24 days was associated with absence of useful arm function at three <b>months.</b> Measurement of <b>finger</b> tapping rate was not useful...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{increased}} {{prevalence of}} malocclusions represents a secular trend {{attributed to the}} interaction of genetic and environmental factors. The analysis of factors related to the causes of these changes is essential for planning public health policies aimed at preventing and clinically intercepting malocclusion. This study investigated the sucking habits, nocturnal mouth breathing, {{as well as the}} relation of these factors with malocclusion. Methods: This is a longitudinal study in which 80 mother-child pairs were monitored from the beginning of pregnancy to the 30 th month after childbirth. Home visits for interviews with the mothers were made on the 12 th, 18 th and 30 th <b>months</b> of age. <b>Finger</b> sucking, pacifier sucking, bottle feeding, breastfeeding and nocturnal mouth breathing, were the variables studies. On the 30 th month, clinical examinations were performed for overjet, overbite and posterior crossbite. A previously calibrated single examiner (Kappa coefficient = 0. 92) was responsible for all examinations. Data were analyzed using the chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests, at a significance level of 5 %. Results: Bottle feeding was the most prevalent habit at 12, 18 and 30 months (87. 5 %; 90 % and 96. 25 %, respectively). Breastfeeding was 40 %, 25 % and 12. 50 % at 12, 18 and 30 months, respectively. Nearly 70 % of the children in this study had some sort of malocclusion. Pacifier sucking habit at 12, 18 and 30 months of age was associated with overjet and open bite; and at 30 months, an association with overbite was also observed. Finger sucking habit and breastfeeding at 12, 18 and 30 months were also associated with overjet and open bite. The posterior crossbite was associated with bottle feeding at 12 and 30 months, and nocturnal mouth breathers at 12 and 18 months. Conclusions: Sucking habits, low rates of breastfeeding, and nocturnal mouth breathing were risk factors for malocclusion...|$|R
