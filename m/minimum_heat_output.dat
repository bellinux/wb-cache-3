50|$|Boiler {{turndown}} ratio is {{the ratio of}} maximum <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> to the <b>minimum</b> level of <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> at which the boiler will operate efficiently or controllably. Many boilers are designed to operate {{at a variety of}} output levels. As the desired temperature/pressure point is approached, the heat source is progressively turned down. If pressure/temperature falls, the heat source is progressively turned up. If a boiler application requires it to operate at a low proportion of its maximum output, a high {{turndown ratio}} is required. Conversely, in applications where the operational conditions are not expected to vary significantly (for example, a large power plant), a low turndown ratio will be sufficient.|$|R
30|$|A Carrier 25 VNA 036 {{centrally}} ducted {{heat pump}} {{is the second}} heat pump studied. It is denoted in all figures and results as “VC” for “Variable Centrally ducted”. Centrally ducted means that these heat pumps can be attached to existing ductwork in one central location where a fan forces the air past the heat pump’s heat exchanger and through the ducts to all the rooms in the home. This simplifies installation because, in many households, ducting and furnaces complete with circulating fans are often already present. When the heat pump is no longer capable of supplying all the heating needs of the home, the conventional home furnace takes over and heats the air travelling through the very same ducts. The performance curves for this heat pump are shown in Fig.  3 [7, 49]. There are two curves each for capacities and COPs. These show the maximum (blue) and <b>minimum</b> (red) <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> and corresponding COPs varying by outdoor temperature. This particular heat pump can operate at temperatures as low as − 19.4 ^∘C.|$|R
40|$|Thermal events {{accompanying}} {{the growth of}} K. aerogenes in batch culture in C- and K+-limited salts media were recorded using a flow-microcalorimeter; growth parameters (biomass, CO 2, pO 2 and pH) were also continuously monitored. Calorimetric data is {{discussed in terms of}} i) the power-time trace profile and ii) enthalpy changes associated with formation of cells and utilization of C-source. Standard experimental and cultural conditions, which affect the measured thermal events, were established; at P = 0. 05 the reproducibility of the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> was 3 %. The reproducibility of other growth parameters were similar. The p-t trace accompanying aerobic growth in glucose-limited media consisted of a single peak, the maximum power output coincided with the cessation of exponential growth and exhaustion of glucose; at this point the CO 2 output was a maximum and pO 2 a <b>minimum.</b> The total <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> increased linearly with glucose concentration. The enthalpy change for anabolic growth processes depends on the temperature and glueose-concentration. Generally the rate of <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> exceeded those for biomass and CO 2 production. Maintenance coefficients for batch growth in glucose- and a-methyl glucoside-limited media are calculated. Addition of a second carbon source to cells growing in glucose had a characteristic effect on the p-t trace depending on its carbon content. The p-t trace of glucose-trained cells in media containing a-MG showed that it was metabolized in the presence of glucose. Results of thermal data for cells trained for growth in a-MG and mixed glucose/a-MG media are discussed in terms of known metabolic pathways. The effects of metabolic inhibitors on thermal, events are discussed in terms of their mode of action; azide inhibited growth in glucose but not in alpha-MG. <p...|$|R
30|$|We {{provide an}} {{estimation}} of the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> necessary to generate the neutrally buoyant plume above the TAG hydrothermal mound, Mid-Atlantic Ridge, located at 26 °N, using a model of plume rise in a density-stratified environment with crossflow. The estimated <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> is 460 ± 40 MW. Previous studies have estimated that the <b>heat</b> <b>outputs</b> from high-temperature hydrothermal discharge and low-temperature diffuse flow at the TAG hydrothermal mound are 90 ± 20 MW and at least 780 MW, respectively. Consequently, the contribution of diffuse flow to make the neutrally buoyant plume is 370 ± 60 MW, which accounts for approximately 80 % of the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> to the neutrally buoyant plume. As this contribution is less than 50 % of the total <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> from the diffuse flow, {{it is likely that}} more than 50 % of the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> from the diffuse flow dissipates in the ambient current.|$|R
40|$|Klebsiella aerogenes {{has been}} grown in carbon-limited chemostats and the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> of {{different}} steady states measured by pumping the culture through an LKB flow microcalorimeter. Initially the flow time between fermentor and microcalorimeter cell was 5 minutes {{during which time}} the steady-state conditions of the chemostat were disturbed and the measured <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> was less than that in the fermentor. To minimise this problem a specially designed fermentor was fitted into the airbath of the microcalorimeter, thus providing temperature control and reducing the flow time between fermentor and microcalorimeter to 1 minute. This design was adequate providing only one dilution rate was used in each experiment. If different dilution rates {{were used in the}} same experiment the fermentor contents could not be maintained at 37 C and inaccurate <b>heat</b> <b>outputs</b> were recorded. It is believed that with modifications this design may be used to accurately determine the energy changes occuring in chemostat cultures. K. aerogenes has been grown in batch culture in media limited by carbon or nitrogen. Characteristic heat output-time records were obtained for each medium. As growth proceeded the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> increased steadily until oxygen became limiting whereupon the rate of <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> decreased. During the stationary phase endogenous metabolism occurred in the carbon-limited media and slow degradation of excess carbon in the nitrogen-limited media both of which gave rise to relatively large <b>heat</b> <b>outputs.</b> The total <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> of nitrogen-limited cultures was greater than that of carbon-limited cultures. When glycine replaced ammonium sulphate as nitrogen source the total <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> was increased. Very inefficient growth occurred when glycine provided both the carbon and nitrogen source.

40|$|In {{the present}} study two {{pozzolanic}} materials are used, Metakaolin (MK) and Fly Ash (PFA), as binary and ternary partial replacement binders with Portland cement (PC) to investigate their effect on {{the rate of heat}} evolution (dQ/dt in J/gh) during hydration, and the heat of hydration, (Q(t) in J/g). For binary PC–PFA blends PC hydration is enhanced in the very early stages of hydration, but at extended periods (up to 120 h) an increase in PFA replacement level causes a systematic reduction in <b>heat</b> <b>output.</b> For binary PC–MK blends the results suggest that the MK initially diminishes PC hydration but the subsequent pozzolanic reaction of MK increasingly contributes to the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> causing some blends to exceed the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> of the PC control. For both systems a principal controlling factor in the PC hydration rate (and the heat evolution rate) is the water requirement of the pozzolan, but for PC–MK blends the pozzolanic reaction of the MK makes a significant contribution to the <b>heat</b> <b>output.</b> However this reaction is controlled both by the availability of water and the supply of Ca 2 + ions from the hydrating PC which introduces an increasing level of complexity to the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> versus time profiles. When combining MK and PFA in ternary PC–MK–PFA blends the MK has a dominant influence on the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> versus time profiles...|$|R

The heat flow data from each of these drainage areas have been assessed making it possible to compare the <b>heat</b> <b>outputs</b> from two independent methods: direct heat measurements and the chloride flux method. For both the Waiotapu/Reporoa Valley drainage and the Waikite drainage a discrepancy exists between the two assessments, with the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> observed at the surface (Waiotapu- 540 {+-} 110 MW; Waikite- 80 MW) nearly double of that calculated from the chloride flux (300 MW; 36 MW respectively).

For Waimangu the direct <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> is assessed as 510 {+-} 60 MW. However the ratio of enthalpy to chloride concentration of the source fluid is not well determined.

This control method is called qualitative-quantitative control method of <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> with utilization of prediction of daily diagram of heat supply in hot-water piping systems of district heating.

The control method should enable elimination {{of the influence of}} transport delay between the heat source and heat consumption of individual relatively concentrated consumers. Transport delay can be in the range up to several hours and depends on the length of feeder piping, which can be up to several kilometers, and on the flow speed of heat transfer medium. © 2015, North Atlantic University Union.

40|$|Rational {{composting}} {{process control}} involves the interrelated factors of <b>heat</b> <b>output,</b> temperature, ventilation, and water removal. The heat is released microbially {{at the expense}} of organic material; temperature is an effect and, because it is a determinant of microbial activity, it is also a cause of heat output; ventilation supplies oxygen and removes heat, mainly through the vaporization of water; water removal results from heat removal. These relationships were implemented in a field-scale process of static-pile configuration, using a mixture of sewage sludge and wood chips. Heat removal was matched to <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> through a temperature feedback control system, thereby maintaining biologically favorable temperatures. The observations indicate that fundamentally {{there are two kinds of}} composting systems: those that are and those that are not temperature self-limiting. The self-limiting system reaches inhibitive temperatures (> 60 °C) which debilitate the microbial community, suppressing decomposition, <b>heat</b> <b>output,</b> and water removal. In contrast, non-self-limiting temperatures (< 60 °C) support a robust community, promoting decomposition, <b>heat</b> <b>output,</b> and water removal...|$|R

ATP-content, arginine ammonification, hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate, Fe(III) -reduction) were compared over a period of 7 to 8 weeks with respect to their sensitivity to indicate modifications of the soil microflora. An agricultural soil was amended with two pesticides and HgCl 2 (Ioxynil 2 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg; Thiram 5 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg; HgCl 2 2 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg). The results show that all methods at least slightly differ from each other, indicating that each one reflects only a part of the microbial life in the soil. Due to limited nutrient supply {{the main part of the}} soil microflora is dormant, but can be activated by addition of an anergy source. While <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> after addition of glucose (potential <b>heat</b> <b>output)</b> determines the whole microflora in the active state, <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> without glucose (actual <b>heat</b> <b>output)</b> seems to indicate mainly the active micro organisms.
