5|$|Late in the day, as the {{situation}} was becoming increasingly desperate throughout the country, Simović, who was both the Prime Minister and Yugoslav Chief of the General Staff, broadcast the following message:All troops must engage the enemy wherever encountered and with every <b>means</b> <b>at</b> their disposal. Don't wait for direct orders from above, but act on your own and be guided by your judgement, initiative, and conscience.|$|E

Former Alaska State representative Andre Marrou {{was selected}} as his running mate. After over a year of campaigning as the Libertarian Party nominee, Paul received very little media coverage, and was excluded from presidential debates. On Election Day, {{he was on the}} ballot in 46 states and the District of Columbia, and finished in third place with approximately 0.47% of the vote, behind Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis and the winner Vice President George H.W. Bush.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method {{of the flow}} pattern identification {{on the basis of}} the analysis of Power Spectral Density (PSD) from the pressure difference data of horizontal flow. Seven parameters of PSD curve such as mean (K 1), variance (K 2), <b>mean</b> <b>at</b> 1 - 3 Hz (K 3), <b>mean</b> <b>at</b> 3 - 8 Hz (K 4), <b>mean</b> <b>at</b> 8 - 13 Hz (K 5), <b>mean</b> <b>at</b> 13 - 25 Hz (K 6) and <b>mean</b> <b>at</b> 25 - 30 Hz (K 7) were used as training vector input of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in order to identify the flow patterns. From the obtained experimental of 123 operating conditions consisting of stratified flow, plug and slug, ANN was trained by using 100 data operation and 23 tested data. The results showed that the new method has a capability to identify the flow patterns of gas-liquid two phase flow with a high accuracy. </p...|$|R

5|$|The Old Swiss Confederacy in the 17th {{century was}} a {{federation}} of thirteen largely independent cantons. The federation comprised rural cantons {{as well as}} city states that had expanded their territories into the countryside by political and military <b>means</b> <b>at</b> {{the cost of the}} previously ruling liege lords. The cities just took over the preexisting administrative structures. In these city cantons, the city councils ruled the countryside; they held the judicial rights and also appointed the district sheriffs (Landvögte).|$|E
5|$|Given {{the history}} of Nazism's rise to power in Germany in the 1930s, the present German state has {{committed}} itself to taking active steps to prevent the rise of any ideology that threatens the values enshrined in the German constitution. The BfV domestic intelligence service (Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz, or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution) regards the aims of Scientology as running counter to Germany's free and democratic order, and has been monitoring Scientology since 1997, as have the Offices for the Protection of the Constitution {{in a number of}} German Länder. Minister for Family Policy Claudia Nolte instituted the surveillance, saying that the church had totalitarian tendencies and that she would oppose Scientology with all the <b>means</b> <b>at</b> her disposal.|$|E
5|$|The {{resistance}} came to {{a climax}} in 1794. In May of that year, federal district attorney William Rawle issued subpoenas for more than 60 distillers in Pennsylvania who had not paid the excise tax. Under the law then in effect, distillers who received these writs would be obligated to travel to Philadelphia to appear in federal court. For farmers on the western frontier, such a journey was expensive, time-consuming, and beyond their <b>means.</b> <b>At</b> the urging of William Findley, Congress modified this law on June 5, 1794, allowing excise trials {{to be held in}} local state courts. But by that time, U.S. marshal David Lenox had already been sent to serve the writs summoning delinquent distillers to Philadelphia. Attorney General William Bradford later maintained that the writs were meant to compel compliance with the law, and that the government did not actually intend to hold trials in Philadelphia.|$|E

25|$|Due to ease {{of access}} {{provided}} by the ferry and rail service, entrepreneurs realized the potential for transforming the sleepy hills north of San Francisco into a recreational destination.
