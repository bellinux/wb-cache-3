25|$|One of {{the most}} popular topics of {{discussion}} in regards to Internet privacy is China. The main concern with privacy of Internet users in China is the lack thereof. China has a well known policy of censorship {{when it comes to the}} spread of information through public media channels. Censorship has been prominent in Mainland China since the communist party gained power in China over 60 years ago. With the development of the Internet, however, privacy became <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for the government. The Chinese Government has been accused of actively limiting and editing the information that flows into the country via various media. The Internet poses a particular set of issues for this type of censorship, especially when search engines are involved. Yahoo! for example, encountered a problem after entering China in the mid-2000s. A Chinese journalist, who was also a Yahoo! user, sent private emails using the Yahoo! server regarding the Chinese government. The Chinese staff of Yahoo! intercepted these emails and sent the journalistâs reportedly bad impression of the country to the Chinese government, which in turn sentenced the journalist to ten years in prison. These types of occurrences have been reported numerous times and have been criticized by foreign entities such as the creators of the Tor anonymity network, which was designed to circumvent network surveillance in multiple countries.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{uncertainty}} of future supply and demand fluctuations, and the price risk imposed on the farmer, said farmer may use different financial transactions to reduce, or hedge, their risk. One such transaction {{is the use of}} forward contracts. Forward contracts are mutual agreements to deliver a certain amount of a commodity at a certain date for a specified price and each contract is unique to the buyer and seller. For this example, the farmer can sell a number of forward contracts equivalent to the amount of wheat he expects to harvest and essentially lock in the current price of wheat. Once the forward contracts expire, the farmer will harvest the wheat and deliver it to the buyer at the price agreed to in the forward contract. Therefore, the farmer has reduced his risks to fluctuations in the market of wheat because he has already guaranteed a certain number of bushels for a certain price. However, there are still many risks associated with this type of hedge. For example, if the farmer has a low yield year and he harvests less than the amount specified in the forward contracts, he must purchase the bushels elsewhere in order to fill the contract. This becomes even <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> when the lower yields affect the entire wheat industry and the price of wheat increases due to supply and demand pressures. Also, while the farmer hedged all of the risks of a price decrease away by locking in the price with a forward contract, he also gives up the right to the benefits of a price increase. Another risk associated with the forward contract is the risk of default or renegotiation. The forward contract locks in a certain amount and price at a certain future date. Because of that, there is always the possibility that the buyer will not pay the amount required {{at the end of the}} contract or that the buyer will try to renegotiate the contract before it expires.|$|E
25|$|The {{stand by}} diver will be {{prepared}} {{in the same}} way as the working diver, but will not enter the water until needed. He will usually be prepared to the stage of readiness to enter the water, and then will remove his mask, or have his helmet removed and will then sit in as comfortable a place as can be found, so that in case of an emergency he can be readied for action in as short a time as possible. This often means setting up some form of shelter from the weather, and heat and sunshine are usually <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> than cold and wet. It is frequently necessary to cool the standby diver to avoid overheating, and dehydration can also be a problem. When the working diver is using a helmet, the standby diver may use a full face mask or bandmask, as this makes it quicker to get into the water in an emergency. The stand by diver's job is to wait until something goes wrong, and then be sent in to sort it out. For this reason a stand by diver should be one of the best divers on the team regarding diving skills and strength, but does not have to be expert at the work skills for the specific job. When deployed, the standby diver will normally follow the umbilical of the diver who is in trouble, as unless it has been severed, it will reliably lead to the correct diver. The standby diver must maintain communications with the supervisor throughout the dive and is expected to give a running commentary of progress so that the supervisor and surface crew know as much as possible what is happening and can plan accordingly, and must take the necessary steps to resolve incidents, which may involve supply of emergency air or locating and rescuing an injured or unconscious diver. In bell diving, the bellman is the standby diver, and may have to recover a distressed diver to the bell and give first aid if necessary and possible.|$|E

There are multiple efforts underway to better understand this disease process. AMD involves the abnormal retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), drusen formation, photoreceptor atrophy, and choroidal neovascularization. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) play an important role in lipid degeneration, immune regulation, regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROSs), as well as regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). These molecules have all been implicated in the pathogenesis of AMD. In addition, PPAR gamma is expressed in RPE, an essential cell in photoreceptor regeneration and vision maintenance. This review summarizes the interactions between PPAR, AMD-related molecules, and AMD-related disease processes. Copyright Â© 2008 Alexandra A. Herzlich et al.

Developments {{in computer technology}} make it possible nowadays realistically simulating cementitious materials and studying its pore network structure.

Inspired by developments in robotics, a pore exploration system is developed in DraMuTS (Double Random Multiple-Tree Structuring). The tree structure inside pores governs pore topology, including pore continuity. For determination of pore geometry such as pore size, a second uniform random point system is used. In each of these points, star volume measurements govern local pore size, while the collected data allow constructing a volume-based pore size distribution. The method is illustrated by means of data pertaining to Portland cement (PC) paste and rice husk ash-blended PC. This approach is demonstrated providing all necessary pore network information relevant for durability estimation. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
