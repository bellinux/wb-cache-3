The Kriegsmarine assumed that the Admiralty would be reading messages completely, within a three to five period, i.e. that Enigma was being read via captured code-books, instead of what was truly happening: The Admiralty was bringing together many sources of information, there could sometimes be days when decrypts were not available, or message messages were partially decrypted, or perhaps <b>message</b> <b>decryption</b> was delayed.

This study {{is based on a}} Mathematical model [9] being used for encryption process, which consumes less power when compared to standard algorithms like 3 DES &amp; RSA. In this work, the model is studied for its strength against noise which is an unavoidable phenomenon with MANET &amp; WSN s. In the considered model, an empirical value is considered which is used as a key. The process is repeated for different timings which are used as time stamps in the encryption mechanism. Thus this model generates a distributed sequence which is used as sub key. The encrypted form of data during the transmission process will be subjected to errors due to some noise sources. These errors can affect the integrity of message or data transfer. The effects of these errors are checked in the present study by modeling the error as a random number having Gaussian Probability Density Function.
