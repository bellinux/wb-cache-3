2500|$|The first {{handheld}} power routers {{were invented}} in 1915 and were Jet <b>Motor</b> <b>Hand</b> Routers, called Onsruters. The name derives {{from a combination}} of the inventor's last name [...] "Onsrud" [...] and the term [...] "router". The Onsruter married a router plane with an endmill to create the first handheld power router. The idea for the Onsruter started when a rail road company decided they wanted to power the front light on a Steam Locomotive using exhaust steam from the engine. Oscar Onsrud and his son Rudy came up with, and submitted, a design for a jet motor (air turbine) to generate the power for the light, however, they failed to win the contract. A few months later Rudy was talking with a friend about his frustrations making the groove {{in the bottom of a}} cane bottom chair using a router plane. A spark went off in Rudy's head that he could re-purpose the jet motor, which he had spent so much time developing, to run on compressed air and spin a modified endmill and make the routed groove easily. The modified endmills would have to spin at 30,000 RPM, instead of the 3,000 RPM of a milling machine, in order to cut wood and not burn it. These bits also needed a steeper rake and clearance angle to evacuate the chips than needed on a traditional endmill. These new bits became known as router bits or router cutters (UK).|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} changes of cortical <b>hand</b> <b>motor</b> representation and motor recovery of the affected hand in subacute stroke. Methods. 17 patients with motor impairment of the affected hand were enrolled in an in-patient neurological rehabilitation program. <b>Hand</b> <b>motor</b> function tests (Wolf Motor Function Test, Action Research Arm Test) and neurophysiological evaluations (resting motor threshold, motor evoked potentials, motor map area size, motor map area volume, and motor map area location) were obtained from both hands and hemispheres at baseline and two, four, and six weeks of in-patient rehabilitation. Results. There was {{a wide spectrum of}} <b>hand</b> <b>motor</b> impairment at baseline and <b>hand</b> <b>motor</b> recovery over time. <b>Hand</b> <b>motor</b> function and recovery correlated significantly with (i) reduction of cortical excitability, (ii) reduction in size and volume of cortical <b>hand</b> <b>motor</b> representation, and (iii) a medial and anterior shift of the center of gravity of cortical <b>hand</b> <b>motor</b> representation within the contralesional hemisphere. Conclusion. Recovery of motor function of the affected hand after stroke is accompanied by definite changes in excitability, size, volume, and location of <b>hand</b> <b>motor</b> representation over the contralesional primary motor cortex. These measures may serve as surrogate markers for the outcome of <b>hand</b> <b>motor</b> rehabilitation after stroke...|$|R

Standing desks may be {{specialized}} to suit particular tasks, such as certain variations of the telephone desk and desks for architectural drafting. Some standing desks may only be used while standing while others allow users to sit or stand by adjusting the desk height with an electric <b>motor,</b> <b>hand</b> crank, or counterbalance system. Some desks are also constructed like teacher's lecterns, allowing them to be set on top of an existing desk for standing, or removed for sitting. While height of most seated desks is standardized, standing desks are made in many different heights ranging from 70 to 128 cm. Ideally the height of a standing desk fits the height of its individual user. With seated desks, adjusting the height relative to the user can be accomplished by adjusting the height of the user's chair. However, because users of a standing desk move around more than when seated, using a pedestal to adjust the user's height is not practical.|$|E

40|$|A causal {{relationship}} between physical activity such as walking and cognitive functions - particularly executive functions and memory - {{has been observed}} in elderly people with and without dementia. Executive functions {{play an important role}} in the (instrumental) activities of daily life [(I) ADL]. However, a close relationship has also been found between motor activity of the upper limb, particularly the hand, and (I) ADL. Indeed, in aging, a decline in <b>hand</b> <b>motor</b> function is related to a decrease in (I) ADL, an increase in functional dependency, admission to a nursing home, and even mortality. This review begins by addressing clinical studies on the effect of age on higher-level <b>hand</b> <b>motor</b> activity.

40|$|Background: For the {{translation}} of noninvasive motor imagery (MI) -based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) from the lab environment to end users at their homes, their handling must be improved. As a key component, the number of electroencephalogram (EEG) -recording electrodes {{has to be kept}} at a minimum. However, due to inter-individual anatomical and physiological variations, reducing the number of electrodes bares the risk of electrode misplacement, which will directly translate into a limited BCI performance of end users. The aim of the study is to evaluate the use of focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as an easy tool to individually optimize electrode positioning for a MI-based BCI. For this, the area of MI-induced mu-rhythm modulation was compared with the <b>motor</b> <b>hand</b> representation area in respect to their localization and to the control performance of a MI-based BCI. Methods: Focal TMS was applied to map the <b>motor</b> <b>hand</b> areas and a 48 -channel high-resolution EEG was used to localize MI-induced mu-rhythm modulations in 11 able-bodied, right-handed subjects (5 male, age: 23 – 31). The online BCI performances of the study participants were assessed with a single next-neighbor Laplace channel consecutively placed over the <b>motor</b> <b>hand</b> area and over the area of the strongest mu-modulation. Results: For most subjects, a consistent deviation between the position of the mu-modulation center and the corresponding <b>motor</b> <b>hand</b> areas well above the localization error could be observed in mediolateral and to a lesser degree in anterior-posterior direction. On an individual level, the MI-induced mu-rhythm modulation was at average found 1. 6  cm (standard deviation (SD) [*]=[*] 1. 30  cm) lateral and 0. 31  cm anterior (SD[*]=[*] 1. 39  cm) to the <b>motor</b> <b>hand</b> area and enabled a significantly better online BCI performance than the <b>motor</b> <b>hand</b> areas. Conclusion: On an individual level a trend towards a consistent average spatial distance between <b>motor</b> <b>hand</b> area and mu-rhythm modulation center was found indicating that TMS may be used as a simple tool for quick individual optimization of EEG-recording electrode positions of MI-based BCIs. The study results indicate that <b>motor</b> <b>hand</b> areas of the primary motor cortex determined by TMS are not the main generators of the cortical mu-rhythm...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} presurgical assessment of reorga-nization of <b>motor</b> <b>hand</b> function in an 11 -year-old girl with intractable epilepsy and a right-sided hemiplegia resulting from an extensive perinatal left hemispheric stroke. Prior to a left functional hemi-spherectomy, functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that both nonparetic and paretic <b>motor</b> <b>hand</b> function predominantly activated the right primary motor cortex, whereas no activation was found in the left hemisphere. Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the right central area yielded responses in both the nonparetic and the paretic hand, whereas no responses were obtained after stim-ulation of the affected hemisphere.

40|$|The {{effect on}} the CNV of {{sustained}} and delayed motor response with the dominant and nondominant hand in the presence and absence of visual performance feedback, was studied in 15 male adults. Monopolar scalp recordings were obtained at Fz, Cz, Pz, and bilaterally over the <b>motor</b> <b>hand</b> area. Results indicated that {{the magnitude of the}} CNV was greater in the delayed than sustained response task, greater in the presence than absence of feedback, and greater over the <b>motor</b> <b>hand</b> area contralateral to movement. Frontal CNV habituated in the sustained, but not the delayed response task, suggested that frontal negative variations in the former case signify an orienting response to novelty or uncertainty. The absence of habituation in the delay condition was interpreted in terms of the motor inhibitory function of frontal association cortex. Performance feedback appeared to enhance CNV indirectly by increasing the motivation of subjects. A multiprocess conception of CNV was proposed in which vortex-negative slow potentials reflect a multiplicity of psychophysiological processes occurring at a variety of cortical and subcortical locations in the brain preparatory to a motor or mental action...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the feasibility {{and safety of}} using navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) to map <b>hand</b> <b>motor</b> cortex and further analyze its clinical application.   Methods The first dorsal interosseous (FDI) was selected as target muscle. The location and area of bilateral FDI were mapped by using nTMS in 10 healthy right-handed volunteers. In order to identify the accuracy of nTMS, all individual MRI volumes and the coordinates of hotspots were normalized to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using SPM 8. Positive sites and motor-evoked potential (MEP) were recorded. The areas of <b>hand</b> <b>motor</b> representations were calculated and compared between bilateral cerebral hemispheres.   Results nTMS was capable of identifying <b>hand</b> <b>motor</b> cortex area in both hemispheres in all cases. It took 45 to 60 minutes to finish the whole nTMS procedures of each side of <b>hand</b> <b>motor</b> area. The motor cortex was found at the Ω area of bilateral precentral gyri. The right <b>hand</b> <b>motor</b> representation area was significantly larger than that of left area [(6. 22 ± 0. 76) cm 2 vs (4. 30 ± 0. 40) cm 2; t = 7. 078, P = 0. 000]. Four cases presented sleepiness, but no side effect such as headache or epilepsy was found.   Conclusions nTMS is a reliable and safe technique to map <b>hand</b> <b>motor</b> cortex.

40|$|Research on the {{evolutionary}} {{basis of the}} human language faculty has proposed the mirror neuron system as a link between motor processing and speech development. Consequently, most work {{has focused on the}} left inferior frontal cortex, in particular Broca’s region, and the left inferior parietal cortex. However, the direct link between planning of <b>hand</b> <b>motor</b> and speech actions has yet to be elucidated. Thus, the present study investigated whether <b>motor</b> sequencing of <b>hand</b> vs. speech actions has a common neural denominator. For the <b>hand</b> <b>motor</b> task, 25 subjects performed single, repeated, or sequenced button presses with either the left or right hand. The speech task was in analogy; the same subjects produced the syllable “po” once or repeatedly, or a sequence of different syllables (“po-pi-po”). Speech <b>motor</b> vs. <b>hand</b> <b>motor</b> effectors resulted in increased perisylvian activation including Broca’s region (left area 44 and areas medially adjacent to left area 45). In contrast, common activation for sequenced vs. repeated production of button presses and syllables revealed the effector-independent involvement of left area 7 A in the superior parietal lobule (SPL) in sequencing. These data demonstrate that sequencing of vocal gestures, an important precondition for ordered utterances and ultimately human speech, shares area 7 A, rather than inferior parietal regions, as a common cortical module with <b>hand</b> <b>motor</b> sequencing. Interestingly, area 7 A has previously also been shown {{to be involved in the}} observation of hand and non-hand actions. In combination with the literature, the present data thus suggest a distinction between area 44, which is specifically recruited for (cognitive aspects of) speech, and SPL area 7 A for general aspects of motor sequencing. In sum, the study demonstrates a previously underspecified role of the SPL in the origins of speech, and may be discussed in the light of embodiment of speech and language in the motor system...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies showed}} that in healthy {{subjects}} the excitability of the hand area of the motor cortex is enhanced during reading aloud, but only on the language-dominant hemisphere. These results indicate {{that there is a}} functional connectivity between cortical areas for hand movement and language on the language-dominant hemisphere. The present study assessed the modulation of this connectivity in patients who have recovered from post-stroke aphasia. In the study the excitability of the right-hand and the left-hand motor cortex during reading aloud was investigated in those patients. The hypothesis was that the excitability of the <b>hand</b> <b>motor</b> cortex of the nondominant hemisphere may be affected in these patients by reading aloud. As control condition, mouth movements without reading were performed. The excitability of the <b>hand</b> <b>motor</b> cortex before, during and after reading was set off by using transcranial magnetic stimulation and measured by motor-evoked potentials. The results showed that the excitability of the <b>hand</b> <b>motor</b> cortex of both hemispheres is enhanced during reading aloud. There was no effect of mouth movements on <b>hand</b> <b>motor</b> cortex excitability. These results suggest a functional connectivity between cortical <b>hand</b> <b>motor</b> and language areas also on the right hemisphere in aphasia patients; this connectivity could be used therapeutically for aphasia rehabilitation. Thus the study may indicate that the right hemisphere is included in the language processing of aphasia patients...|$|R

How rTMS may have persistent effects on cortical function remains unclear. We hypothesised that it may act by modulating cortico-cortical connectivity.

Sixteen healthy subjects received a single train (5 Hz, active motor threshold, 50 stimuli) of rTMS to the left <b>motor</b> <b>hand</b> area. Spectral power and coherence estimates were calculated between different EEG signals at rest and while muscles of the distal upper limb were tonically contracted.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Repetitive {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation (rTMS) shows {{promise as}} a treatment for various movement and psychiatric disorders. Just how rTMS may have persistent effects on cortical function remains unclear. We hypothesised that it may act by modulating cortico-cortical and interhemispheric connectivity. To this end we assessed cortico-cortical and interhemispheric coherence before and after low frequency, subthreshold rTMS of the left motor cortex. METHODS: Fifteen healthy subjects received one train (1 Hz, 90 % of active motor threshold, 1500 stimuli) of rTMS to the left <b>motor</b> <b>hand</b> area. Spectral power and coherence estimates were calculated between different electroencephalogram (EEG) signals at rest and while muscles of the distal upper limb were tonically contracted. RESULTS: rTMS over the left <b>motor</b> <b>hand</b> area caused a significant increase in ipsilateral EEG-EEG coherence and in the interhemispheric coherence between motor areas in the alpha band. The effects of rTMS lasted up to 25 min post-stimulation. There was no significant change in EEG-EEG coherence over the hemisphere contralateral to stimulation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Recent {{research}} {{has provided evidence}} for a genetically mediated association between language or reading-related cognitive deficits and impaired motor coordination. Other studies have identified relationships between lateralization of hand skill and cognitive abilities. With a large sample, the authors aimed to investigate genetic relationships between measures of reading-related cognition, <b>hand</b> <b>motor</b> skill, and <b>hand</b> skill lateralization. METHOD: The authors applied univariate and bivariate correlation and familiality analyses {{to a range of}} measures. They also performed genomewide linkage analysis of <b>hand</b> <b>motor</b> skill in a subgroup of 195 sibling pairs. RESULTS: <b>Hand</b> <b>motor</b> skill was significantly familial (maximum heritability= 41 %), as were reading-related measures. <b>Hand</b> <b>motor</b> skill was weakly but significantly correlated with reading-related measures, such as nonword reading and irregular word reading. However, these correlations were not significantly familial in nature, and the authors did not observe linkage of <b>hand</b> <b>motor</b> skill to any chromosomal regions implicated in susceptibility to dyslexia. Lateralization of hand skill was not correlated with reading or cognitive ability. CONCLUSIONS: The authors confirmed a relationship between lower motor ability and poor reading performance. However, the genetic effects on motor skill and reading ability appeared to be largely or wholly distinct, suggesting that the correlation between these traits may have arisen from environmental influences. Finally, the authors found no evidence that reading disability and/or low general cognitive ability were associated with ambidexterity.

Method: We compared stereotaxic localisation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with the commonly used operational definition of 6 cm anterior {{to the site of the}} abductor pollicis brevis muscle in healthy participants (n = 18). We also report the average translational distance from the site of the abductor pollicis brevis to the stereotaxically defined dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Results: The stereotaxic method was less variable than the operational method of localisation and more frequently targeted the middle frontal gyrus. The average translational distance from the site of the abductor pollicis brevis to the stereotaxically targeted dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was x = − 5 mm, y = 53 mm and z = − 31 mm. Conclusions: Operational localisation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation with reference to the <b>motor</b> <b>hand</b> area is more variable than stereotaxic localisation.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{effects of}} sign language use and auditory deprivation from birth on the volumes of three cortical {{regions of the}} human brain: the visual cortex surrounding the calcarine sulcus in the occipital lobe; the language-related cortex in the inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis and pars opercularis); and the <b>motor</b> <b>hand</b> region in the precentral gyrus. The study included 25 congenitally deaf participants and 41 hearing participants (of which 16 were native sign language users); all were right-handed. Deaf participants exhibited a larger calcarine volume than hearing participants, which we interpret as the likely result of cross-modal compensation and/or dynamic interactions within sensory neural networks. Deaf participants also had increased volumes of the pars triangularis bilaterally compared to hearing signers and non-signers, which we interpret {{is related to the}} increased linguistic demands of speech processing and/or text reading for deaf individuals. Finally, although no statistically significant differences were found in the <b>motor</b> <b>hand</b> region for any of the groups, the deaf group was leftward asymmetric, the hearing signers essentially symmetric and the hearing non-signers were rightward asymmetric – results we interpret as the possible result of activity-dependent change due to life-long signing.
