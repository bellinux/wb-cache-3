Believing that in a wise way it is good to go to church, and that associating with Christians would improve my character, I have adopted the Christian religion. I believe that the church has helped me much during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, because it seems to <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> religion in enabling one to live right.|$|E

500|$|Coach John Heisman's swift backfield {{used the}} pre-snap {{movement}} of his [...] "jump shift" [...] offense, and Al Hill led the team in carries.

500|$|The second witness {{called by}} the defense was United Press International (UPI) {{journalist}} and Hendrix's friend Sharon Lawrence, who testified that she was with Hendrix in California when, after complaining about feeling ill, an unnamed fan gave him something. When Malone suggested that her memory was suspiciously acute, she explained that her training as a reporter prepared her to notice fine details. Hendrix's manager and producer, Chas Chandler, was called next, and he corroborated the defense's assertion that rock stars, particularly Hendrix, would regularly receive gifts from fans and that those gifts often included drugs. In its closing argument, the defense reiterated {{that in order to}} be guilty of possession of narcotics Hendrix had to have knowledge of the illegal drugs. After a trial that had lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for more than eight hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges. Torontoist Kevin Plummer wrote: [...] "As the all-male jury announced its acquittal, the courtroom—crowded with young people—erupted into applause." [...] In remarks to reporters after the verdict was announced, Hendrix commented: [...] "Canada has given <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> Christmas present I ever had", while flashing a peace sign.|$|E

500|$|Southey {{intended}} Madoc {{to rival}} {{the works of}} Homer, and Coleridge believed that the poem {{would be better than}} the Aeneid. However, Madoc received mixed reviews from critics; while one critic believed it was comparable to John Milton's Paradise Lost, another felt that it was unreadable. In letter written by William Wordsworth on 3 June 1805, he claimed that he was [...] "highly pleased with it; it abounds in beautiful pictures and descriptions happily introduced, and there is an animation diffused through the whole story though it cannot perhaps be said that any of the characters interest you much, except perhaps young Llewllyn whose situation is highly interesting, and he appears to <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> conceived and sustained character in the piece [...] The Poem fails in the highest gifts of the poet's mind Imagination in the true sense of the word, and knowledge of human Nature and human heart. There is nothing that shows the hand of the great Master". He followed this with a letter on 29 July 1805 saying [...] "Southey's mind does not seem strong enough to draw the picture of a Hero. The character of Madoc is often very insipid and contemptible [...] In short, according to my notion, the character is throughout languidly conceived". Dorothy Wordsworth, William's sister, wrote on 11 June 1805 to claim that [...] "We have read Madoc with great delight [...] I had one painful feeling throughout, that I did not care as much about Madoc as the Author wished me to do, and that the characters in general are not sufficiently distinct to make them have a separate after-existence in my affection." ...|$|E

2500|$|Synthtopia, an {{electronic}} music review website, stated that Vangelis' music could {{be referred to}} as [...] "symphonic electronica" [...] because of his use of synthesizers in an orchestral fashion. The site went on to describe his music as melodic: [...] "drawing on the melodies of folk music, especially the Greek music of his homeland". Vangelis' music and compositions have also been described as [...] "...a distinctive sound with simple, repetitive yet memorable tunes against evocative rhythms and chord progressions." [...] His first electric instrument was a Hammond B3 organ, while first synthesizer a Korg 700 monophonic. He has often used vibrato on his synthesizers, which was carried out in a distinctive way on his Yamaha CS-80 polyphonic synthesizer – varying the pressure exerted on the key to produce the expressive vibrato sound. In a 1984 interview Vangelis described the CS-80 as [...] "The most important synthesizer in my career — and for <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> analogue synthesizer design there has ever been." ...|$|E
