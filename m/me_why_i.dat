500|$|Morrissey had {{specific}} {{instructions on how}} he wanted the [...] "Hand in Glove" [...] single to be packaged. He told Rough Trade's art department that the single should have a paper label centre with four vents encircling the middle, in homage to singles from the 1960s. The cover to the single features a photograph of George O'Mara by Jim French, taken from Margaret Walters' history The Nude Male. The sleeve's homoerotic undertones elicited the reaction Morrissey was hoping for of unease and outrage. Rourke said when he showed the recording to his parents his father was [...] "mortified. He said to me, 'that's a bloke's bum' and I said, 'yeah' but when he asked <b>me</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> just didn't {{have an answer for}} him".|$|E
500|$|Sheila gives Berger {{a yellow}} shirt. He goofs around {{and ends up}} tearing it in two. [...] Sheila voices her {{distress}} that Berger seems to care more about the [...] "bleeding crowd" [...] than about her ("Easy to Be Hard"). [...] Jeanie summarizes everyone's romantic entanglements: [...] "I'm hung up on Claude, Sheila's hung up on Berger, Berger is hung up everywhere. Claude is hung up on a cross over Sheila and Berger." [...] The tribe runs out to the audience with fliers inviting them to a Be-In. [...] Berger, Woof and another tribe member pay satiric tribute to the American flag as they fold it ("Don't Put it Down"). [...] After young and innocent Crissy describes [...] "Frank Mills", a boy she's looking for, the tribe participates in the [...] "Be-In". [...] The men of the tribe burn their draft cards. [...] Claude puts his card in the fire, then changes his mind and pulls it out. [...] He asks, [...] "where is the something, where is the someone, that tells <b>me</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> live and die?" [...] ("Where Do I Go"). [...] The tribe emerges naked, intoning [...] "beads, flowers, freedom, happiness." ...|$|E
500|$|Agnew's first {{marriage}} was to Beverley in 1983; it {{ended in divorce}} in 1992, a year after he became BBC cricket correspondent. He has written about the role that cricket played {{in the collapse of}} the relationship, comparing his circumstances with those of then England batsman Graham Thorpe. He also found that his job interfered with his relationship with his children: I had two young children, aged seven and five... it was quickly evident that for me to have custody of my daughters – or even to form a relationship with them – was made impossible by my job. What chance do you have when, be it playing Test cricket or commentating on it, you are away {{for months at a time}} each and every winter?... There was one occasion when I did not recognise my eldest, Jennifer, when I returned from one tour... my children continue to ask <b>me</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> did not resign and take a job that would have kept me in the country and allowed me to see them more often. I find that one especially hard to answer." [...] Agnew has subsequently remarried: he met Emma Agnew, current editor of BBC East Midlands Today, when they worked together on BBC Radio Leicestershire.|$|E

500|$|... "Upper West Side Story" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics, with many praising the mostly standalone format and {{the rebuilding of}} Neal and Peter's relationship. [...] Morgan Glennon of the Huffington Post called the episode [...] "a really fun undercover romp that still deals with the fallout between Neal and Peter." [...] Michelle Carlbert stated that she [...] "felt like it put Neal and Peter back on track" [...] and that she enjoyed the standalone case. [...] Brittany Frederick of Starpulse.com said that [...] "this is an episode that reminds <b>me</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> {{fell in love with}} White Collar." [...] Frederick compared the episode to [...] "Mr. Monk Goes Back to School", an episode of USA Network's Monk; she likened Baker's character to that of Andrew McCarthy's in Monk, stating that as a villain, McCarthy was evil yet endearing, while Baker appeared genuinely evil. [...] She also praised the series for utilizing comedy rather than drama. [...] Kenny Herzog of The A.V. Club gave the episode a more mixed review, stating that while the series was [...] "at its caper-hatching best," [...] it was [...] "also its most excessively ludicrous." [...] Like Frederick, Herzog praised the use of comedy, though he felt that Baker appeared to be more like [...] "a cartoon bully." [...] He ultimately gave the episode a B-.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Polygon, Eric Watson {{said that}} [...] "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s fourth season pulls the best {{elements}} from the MCU {{and the most}} over-the-top elements from comics to remind <b>me</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> love Marvel: superheroes punching Nazis." [...] He said this was refreshing after the controversial comic storyline Secret Empire which sees the patriotic Captain America revealed to be a sleeper agent for Hydra. Carli Velocci at TheWrap also discussed the season in relation to Secret Empire, noting that Agents of Hydra [...] "hasn’t spawned a digital mountain of outrage" [...] like the commic event. She said that Secet Empire [...] "all but ignores [...] real world context, minus acknowledging that Nazis tend to like concentration camps. If anything, it treats the subject matter like window dressing, background for a plot intended to blow readers’ minds ... Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, however, embraces that real world context. It does everything it can {{to ensure that the}} real world still matters and that the audience understands the negative consequences of a Nazi-driven society. And unlike the comic book counterpart, it doesn’t shy away from the fact that Hydra is definitely rooted in the Third Reich." [...] She continued that the series [...] "manages to create a world where Hydra is the establishment, but every other plot point is about questioning it explicitly" [...] and [...] "what’s more inspiring than seeing an actual symbol of America not taking crap from Nazis? Wherever the comic series takes Captain America, it shouldn’t have lost sight of that. Fortunately, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. didn’t." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} by critics who gave a polarised {{view on the}} writing and handling of Shepherd's death. Ashley Bissette Sumerel of TV Fanatic gave the episode the highest praise in a 5 out of 5 star review highlighting the [...] "interesting possibilities" [...] that the death would offer for the show. However, she stated, [...] "I'm beyond heartbroken. [...] We've seen tragic deaths and lost beloved characters, but never quite like this. I don't think I'll ever get over it." [...] She also acknowledged the show's emotional connect with its audience and it's courage to attempt the [...] "inconceivable". Ariana Bacle of Entertainment Weekly {{took the opportunity to}} reminisce {{the early years of the}} show saying that it's the compelling characters that have made committing to Grey's [...] "irresistible". She added that despite some [...] "weak moments" [...] that the series suffers from, characters like [...] "Meredith or Derek or Webber will have a moment that reminds <b>me</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> keep watching, why I never stopped— so watching one of those characters die hurts. It really, really hurts." [...] In a mixed review for the episode, a Spoiler TV writer criticized the plot calling it a [...] "self-indulgent episode", contrasted it with [...] "well crafted departure of Mark Sloan, or by Lexie Grey". Also criticizing the absence of the series' major cast from the episode the review said, [...] "The presence of so many inconsequential and uninteresting characters was continually in danger of swamping the dreaminess of Derek." [...] However, appreciative of Pompeo's character, the reviewer remarked, [...] "the writing of Meredith was completely on point. She was clinical, as we would expect her to be." ...|$|E

Club {{gave the}} episode an 'A', saying [...] "Community is going {{away for a}} while, but it's going away with an episode that reminds <b>me</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> love the show so much. This is a very {{personal}} thing—since humor's subjective like that—but for me, this was the funniest episode since the clip show... I laughed myself silly at this one, {{to the point where}} I was devolving into hiccups at certain scenes, and I'm glad we get to go out on an episode like this, one that plays around with form and makes me laugh." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix also praised the Glee-spoofing, saying [...] "'Regional Holiday Music' was the logical, clever, funny endpoint to it." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste said, [...] "As with its best theme-episodes, the show bridged the gap between high-concept parody and character-based comedy." [...] TV Fanatic's Leigh Raines gave the episode a 4/5 rating, saying while the show [...] "definitely went out with a bang, it didn't totally blow my socks off... While there were a few moments that upped the ick factor, overall this episode fell on the positive side." [...] She praised Troy and Abed's rap performance, but called the scene where Annie seduces Jeff [...] "creepy". Robert Canning of IGN said it was a [...] "great" [...] episode, but [...] "faltered just a bit" [...] at the end: [...] "Abed's realization that his attempts to brighten the holiday only made things darker, as Jeff had previously suggested, fit the character well enough, but the study group's follow-up felt a bit forced and holiday hokey. Of course, that could well have been the point." ...|$|E

One journalist who took the tour, 60 Minutes producer Henry Schuster, said: [...] "A few minutes inside that cell and two hours inside Supermax were enough to remind <b>me</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> left high school a year early.

2500|$|If successful, Lee {{maintained}} that his plan, {{which would include}} dredging and other measures to improve Korea's waterways, would decrease water pollution, and bring economic benefits to local communities. Speaking in 2005 about the project, Lee said, [...] "Many journalists questioned <b>me</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> keep commenting on {{the building of the}} canal. However, it's a simple fact that many cities around the world were benefited by making the best use of their rivers and seas." [...] At a special conference held on 19 June 2008, President Lee announced that he would drop the Grand Canal project if the public opposed the idea, and the premier confirmed this statement on 8 September 2008. Despite this assurance, many now accuse Lee of continuing the canal plan under the guise of [...] "maintenance of the 4 great rivers (4대강 정비사업)." ...|$|E

He constantly teases Yossarian asking him {{if he wants to}} know why, to which Yossarian invariably says [...] "yes". Orr never gives any straightforward explanation for this other than he wants big cheeks and to detract from the peculiarity of this he keeps rubber balls in his hands. As he explains the latter, [...] "Every time someone asked <b>me</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> was walking around with crab apples in my cheeks, I'd just open my hands and show them it was rubber balls I was walking around with, not crab apples, and that they were in my hands, not my cheeks.

Murray Abraham {{portrays a}} fictional {{character}} named Bud Grossman, who owns The Gate of Horn folk club in Chicago, {{the same name}} as Albert Grossman's Chicago club. In the film, fictional folk singer Llewyn Davis (played by Oscar Isaac) auditions for Bud Grossman, who replies: [...] "I don't {{see a lot of}} money here." [...] This comment refers to the experience of Dave Van Ronk, who recounted a similar audition for Grossman, who then asked: [...] "Do you know who works here? Big Bill Broonzy works here. Josh White works here... Now tell <b>me</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> should hire you?" [...] After this comment, Grossman offers Davis a part in a band he is about to put together, consisting of two guys and a girl, which one journalist notes is [...] "a reference to Peter, Paul, and Mary, the trio that Albert Grossman put together in 1961—ultimately choosing Noel Paul Stookey as the third member of the group, rather than Van Ronk, whom he also considered."
