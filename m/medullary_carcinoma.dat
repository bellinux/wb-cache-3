40|$|Abstract Introduction Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to present in association with <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>carcinoma,</b> however, <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>carcinoma</b> and papillary thyroid carcinoma represent rare entities. In recent years this rarity has been increasingly observed. The pathogenesis is still controversial. Genetic analysis of RET proto-oncogenes in cases of simultaneous papillary thyroid <b>carcinoma</b> and <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>carcinoma</b> has so far provided conflicting results; although it seems that germline mutations play a potential {{role in the development}} of both histological types. Case presentations This paper describes four rare cases of simultaneous <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>carcinoma</b> and papillary thyroid microcarcinoma with unique features: Case one was a 43 -year-old Jewish woman, born in Israel, daughter of a Latvian immigrant mother and a father born in Israel. Case two was a 44 -year-old Arab woman born in Israel. Case three was a 45 -year-old Jewish woman, born in Israel, daughter of Moroccan immigrant parents and is unique for the presence of lymph node metastatic <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>carcinoma,</b> and one lymph node with metastatic papillary carcinoma found in the same side. Case four was a 77 -year-old Jewish woman, born in Iraq. These cases are unique in their composition of thyroid carcinoma, consisting of histologic features of <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>carcinoma,</b> papillary thyroid microcarcinoma, and follicular thyroid adenoma. The four cases represent different ethnicity groups that live in north Israel, and case four is notable for the advanced age of the patient (77 years). Conclusion These four cases add more data supporting the coincidental coexistence of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma; our results may suggest that the simultaneous occurrence of <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>carcinoma</b> and papillary thyroid microcarcinoma is generally a simple reflection of this coincidence. Endocrinologists and pathologists should be aware of this entity. The pathologist can play a pivotal role in identifying papillary thyroid microcarcinoma in concurrent existence with <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>carcinoma.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Hypercalcitoninemia has {{frequently}} been reported {{as a marker}} for <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>carcinoma.</b> Currently, calcitonin measurements are mostly useful {{in the evaluation of}} tumor size and progression, and as an index of biochemical improvement of <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>carcinomas.</b> Although measurement of calcitonin is a highly sensitive method for the detection of <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>carcinoma,</b> it presents a low specificity for this tumor. Several physiologic and pathologic conditions other than <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>carcinoma</b> have been associated with increased levels of calcitonin. Several cases of thyroid nodules associated with increased values of calcitonin are not <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>carcinomas,</b> but rather are related to other conditions, such as hypercalcemias, hypergastrinemias, neuroendocrine tumors, renal insufficiency, papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas, and goiter. Furthermore, prolonged treatment with omeprazole (> 2 - 4 months), beta-blockers, glucocorticoids and potential secretagogues, have been associated with hypercalcitoninemia. An association between calcitonin levels and chronic auto-immune thyroiditis remains controversial. Patients with calcitonin levels > 100 pg/mL have a high risk for <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>carcinoma</b> (~ 90 %- 100 %), whereas patients with values from 10 to 100 pg/mL (normal values: < 8. 5 pg/mL for men, < 5. 0 pg/mL for women; immunochemiluminometric assay) have a < 25 % risk for <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>carcinoma.</b> In multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), RET mutation analysis is the gold-standard for the recommendation of total preventive thyroidectomy to relatives at risk of harboring a germline RET mutation (50 %). False-positive calcitonin results within MEN 2 families have led to incorrect indications of preventive total thyroidectomy to RET mutation negative relatives. In this review, we focus on the differential diagnosis of hypercalcitoninemia, underlining its importance for the avoidance of misdiagnosis of <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>carcinoma</b> and consequent incorrect recommendation for thyroid surgery...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{involvement}} of the testis by metastatic <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>carcinoma</b> has never been described before. We describe the first case of metastatic <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>carcinoma</b> affecting testis and inguinal lymph nodes. CASE PRESENTATION: A 73 -year-old Caucasian man was referred to undergo urologic surgery due to a painless nodule in the right testis and an homolateral inguinal lymphoadenomegaly. The patient {{had a history of}} <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>carcinoma</b> with relapsing disease to the spine and lung nodules. Serum calcitonin and CEA levels were 175 pg/ml and 22 ng/ml, respectively. With suspected testicular cancer, the patient underwent radical right orchiectomy with the excision biopsy of the right inguinal lymph node. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry revealed that both the lesions were due to metastases from <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>carcinoma.</b> CONCLUSION: Metastases to the testis and inguinal lymph nodes may be due to various solid and hematological tumors. This case, despite its rarity, suggests that testis and inguinal lymph nodes should be considered as potential secondary sites of <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>carcinoma</b> as well...|$|R

50|$|The {{etiology}} of renal <b>medullary</b> <b>carcinoma</b> {{is still not}} completely understood.

40|$|<b>Medullary</b> thyroid <b>carcinoma</b> {{currently}} {{accounts for}} 5 – 8 % of all thyroid cancers. The clinical {{course of this}} disease varies from extremely indolent tumors that can go unchanged for years to an extremely aggressive variant {{that is associated with}} a high mortality rate. As many as 75 % of all <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>carcinomas</b> are sporadic, with an average age at presentation reported as 60 years, and the remaining 25 % are hereditary with an earlier age of presentation, ranging from 20 to 40 years. Germline RET proto-oncogene mutations are the genetic causes of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 and a strong genotype-phenotype correlation exists, particularly between a specific RET codon mutation and the (a) age-related onset and (b) thyroid tumor progression, from C-cell hyperplasia to <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>carcinoma</b> and, ultimately, to nodal metastases. RET mutations predispose an individual to the development of <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>carcinomas</b> and can also influence the individual response to RET protein receptor-targeted therapies. RET codon 609 point mutations are rare genetic events belonging to the intermediate risk category for the onset of <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>carcinoma.</b> A large genealogy resulting in a less aggressive form of <b>medullary</b> thyroid <b>carcinoma</b> is associated with the high penetrance of pheochromocytoma and has been reported in the literature.
