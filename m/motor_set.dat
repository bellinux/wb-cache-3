50|$|The field {{windings}} in the stator of an induction <b>motor</b> <b>set</b> up a {{rotating magnetic field}} through the rotor. The relative motion between this field and the rotor induces electric current in the conductive bars. In turn these currents lengthwise in the conductors react with the magnetic field of the motor to produce force acting at a tangent orthogonal to the rotor, resulting in torque to turn the shaft. In effect the rotor is carried around with the magnetic field but at a slightly slower rate of rotation. The difference in speed is called slip and increases with load.|$|E

40|$|This study {{classified}} speech {{impairment in}} 200 patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) into five levels of overall severity {{and described the}} corresponding type (voice, articulation, fluency) and extent (rated on a five-point scale) of impairment for each level.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) {{has been}} {{associated}} with set switching difficulty in both the motor and the cognitive domain. However, the contribution of these set switching deficits to the primary motor symptoms of the disease is unclear. We investigated whether set switching deficits contribute to gait and stepping problems in PD. By contrasting motor and cognitive set switching within the same paradigm, we investigated the nature of set switching deficits associated with freezing of gait (FOG). METHODS: We integrated step initiation with set switching within one task and compared patients with and without FOG with healthy subjects. <b>Motor</b> <b>set</b> switching was defined as a change in stepping direction from one trial to the next. Cognitive set switching was defined as a change in task rule (ie, respond according to the shape or color of the presented stimulus). RESULTS: We found delayed motor switching in PD patients with FOG. We did not observe impaired cognitive switching. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that <b>motor</b> <b>set</b> switching deficits, commonly reported in tasks using verbal or tapping responses, extend to stepping and can contribute to the occurrence of freezing episodes during gait initiation...|$|E

Because of these differences, {{parents of children with}} ASD may portray different behaviors than parents of typically developing children.  This research aims to find how parents engage with their child (either with or without ASD) in distinctly different play settings; one that promotes social play and one that promotes gross motor function and physical activity). Parents were coded on five behaviors using an adapted parent-child interaction rating scale from EHS: 24 -month 3 bag scales.

40|$|The {{silent period}} (SP) after {{transcranial}} stimulation {{is used as}} a diagnostic tool in various central nervous system disorders although no standardized experimental setup has been established. The aim {{of this study was to}} demonstrate the influence of an isotonic compared to an isometric experimental condition. The SP after transcranial magnetic brain stimulation in the biceps brachii and brachioradialis muscle was up to 130 % longer when elicited during a maintain-position (isotonic) task as compared to a maintain-force task (isometric) when stimulus intensities of 5 % to 25 % above threshold were used. The mean SP duration in these muscles was positively correlated to the mean contraction time in both tasks. However, no such relationship was observed for the trials within the individual subjects. We speculate that the invariably longer SP of the maintain-position task was due to the different "motor set" which predictively determined the muscle behavior after the stimulus. In the maintain-position trials, the stimulus-induced long-lasting flexion movement is counteracted by a <b>motor</b> <b>set</b> aiming to relax the elbow flexors immediately after the stimulus. In the maintain-force task the contraction twitch is short and a force drop below the preset level must be prevented by a <b>motor</b> <b>set</b> aiming to contract the elbow flexors immediately after the stimulus. The latter may increase the synaptic input to the motoneuron pool and facilitate the reoccurrence of the electromyogram terminating the SP. At high-stimulus intensities the SP duration increased in both tasks, and the task-dependent differences disappeared. Therefore, when using the SP duration for diagnostic purposes, isometric conditions and high-stimulus intensities should be used...|$|E

The aim of the experiments reported here was to establish whether the size-weight illusion was sensorial or was caused directly by an expectancy. In Experiment 3, which was the crucial experiment, subjects first looked at an object (from a 3 x 5, size x weight, factorial design), and then the object was hidden from view. Immediately after the object was hidden from view, the subjects lifted the object and rated its heaviness. It was expected that any possible <b>motor</b> <b>set,</b> or any perceptual or cognitive expectancy, should persist during the lifting. The size-weight illusion did not occur in Experiment 3.
