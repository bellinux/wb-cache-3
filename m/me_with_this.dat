Ellis-Bextor stated that she released the song because [...] "it was important to <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> single to push boundaries {{a little bit and}} part of that is explore a few musical directions that are a bit more unexpected, so it's been nice to release a ballad".|$|E

I'm absolutely loving the opportunity to explore her backstory." [...] Speaking about her reaction to the plot she continued, [...] "I was like, 'Oh my gosh!' I was so shocked but absolutely chuffed to bits {{because this is what}} all actors want – something massive like this to sink my teeth into. I feel so privileged that they've trusted <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> story. I know they've wanted to do it for a while and they've finally chosen me!" ...|$|E
500|$|As Caragiale senior died, Mateiu {{initially}} {{planned to}} join the mainstream Conservative Party and demand a post from Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino, the Mayor of Bucharest and a close associate of Bogdan-Pitești. Nevertheless, he came to define this position as [...] "a bad solution", and, as Maiorescu and Ionescu formed an alliance, he successfully requested appointment from Bădărău, eventually obtaining it through the means of a decree signed by King Carol I. Caragiale later commented: [...] " [...] entrusted <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> golden key, which I had wanted for so long, and which, for all of this, I had not been desperate to obtain." [...] This contradicted another one of his accounts, in which he confessed that, initially received with indifference by Bădărău, he had claimed that him joining the Conservative-Democrats had been Ion Luca's dying request. Șerban Cioculescu would comment: [...] "There {{could not have been}} a more complete distortion of a parent's last wish!" ...|$|E
500|$|Despite this, {{shortly after}} the British race McLaren's {{experienced}} team manager Teddy Mayer decided not to continue with Villeneuve for the following year. His explanation was that Villeneuve [...] "was looking as though {{he might be a}} bit expensive" [...] and that Patrick Tambay, the team's eventual choice for 1978, was showing similar promise. Villeneuve was left with no solid options for 1978, although Canadian Walter Wolf, for whom Villeneuve had driven in Can-Am racing, considered giving him a drive at Wolf Racing. Rumours circulated that Villeneuve was one of several drivers in whom Ferrari's team was interested, and in August 1977 he flew to Italy to meet Enzo Ferrari, who was immediately reminded of the pre-war European champion Tazio Nuvolari: [...] "When they presented <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> 'piccolo Canadese' (little Canadian), this minuscule bundle of nerves, I immediately recognised in him the physique of Nuvolari and said to myself, let's give him a try." [...] Ferrari was satisfied with Villeneuve's promise after a session at Ferrari's Fiorano test track, despite the Canadian making many mistakes and setting relatively slow times, and Villeneuve signed to drive for Ferrari in the last two races of the 1977 season and the 1978 season. Villeneuve later remarked that: [...] "If someone said to me that you can have three wishes, my first would have been to get into racing, my second to be in Formula 1, my third to drive for Ferrari..." ...|$|E

500|$|Beyond Star Treks fictional innovations, its {{contributions}} to TV history included a multicultural and multiracial cast. While {{more common in}} subsequent years, in the 1960s it was controversial to feature an Enterprise crew that included a Japanese helmsman, a Russian navigator, a black female communications officer, and a human–Vulcan first officer. Captain Kirk's and Lt. Uhura's kiss, in the episode [...] "Plato's Stepchildren", was also daring, and is often mis-cited as being American television's first scripted, interracial kiss, even though several other interracial kisses predated this one. In an interview Nichelle Nichols, who played the black female communications officer, said that the day after she told Roddenberry she planned to leave the show, she was at a fund-raiser at the NAACP and was told {{there was a big}} fan who wanted to meet her. Nichols said, I thought it was a Trekkie, and so I said, 'Sure.' I looked across the room, and there was Dr. Martin Luther King walking towards <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> big grin on his face. He reached out to me and said, 'Yes, Ms. Nichols, I am your greatest fan.' He said that Star Trek was the only show that he, and his wife Coretta, would allow their three little children to stay up and watch. [...] I never got to tell him why, because he said, 'You can't. You're part of history.' When she told Roddenberry what King had said, he cried.|$|E
500|$|The Diane Martel-directed {{music video}} for [...] "Love Sex Magic" [...] premiered on March 22, 2009.

I'm basically giving you a show you'd see in Vegas—and it's my love, sex and magic show. He's the voyeur and I play with him a little bit. I got my inspiration from the Crazy Horse show and just from the shows , period. It's giving you the elements of love and sex and magic." [...] In a later interview about the video, Ciara stated {{that she had to}} lick Timberlake's ear, and at one point, he was licking her neck and they were [...] "freestyling." [...] Martel wanted them to do something [...] "edgy," [...] so they found a [...] "cool way to do it." [...] Ciara noted the different pauses in cuts in between the tapings, commenting [...] "so it's licking on the neck, again, then his biting on my neck, again. It was really funny." [...] The singer would later elaborate on the Crazy Horse show reference in {{an interview with}} Blues & Soul, explaining that she had so much respect for the show that it became her reference. On working with Timberlake, she said, [...] "Justin {{is one of the most}} easy-going, down-to-earth, hard-working and passionate artists you could ever work with. And, with both me and him, our goal was just to make the best video we could possibly make together, and to give the fans something a little fun and a little unexpected." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{booked a}} two-week tour with Spitalfield, but Pareskuwicz {{was unable to}} get time off from work and Kunasch {{was kicked out of}} the band as the group [...] "had all gotten sick of him." [...] Kunasch was {{temporarily}} replaced by friend Brandon Hamm on guitar, alongside drummer Chris Envy from the recently disbanded Showoff, but both quit prior to the kickoff of the tour. The band invited Hurley instead to fill-in once more, while Stump borrowed one of Trohman's guitars for the trek. While most shows were cancelled, the band played any show possible: [...] "Let's just get on whatever show we can. You can pay us in pizza," [...] remembered Wentz. As the tour concluded, the general consensus was that Hurley would be the band's new drummer, and the band began to shop around the three songs from the group's unreleased split as a demo to record labels. The band members set their sights on pop punk labels, and attempted with considerable effort to join Drive-Thru Records. A showcase for label co-founders went largely mediocre, and the band were offered to sign to side label Rushmore, an offer that the members of the band declined. They got particularly far in discussions with The Militia Group and Victory Records, and Bob McLynn of Crush Management became the band's first manager. The band re-entered the studio with O'Keefe to record several more tracks to create label interest. Wentz felt [...] "in the backseat" [...] in writing the songs and temporarily questioned his place in the group, but Stump argued in his favor: [...] "No! That's not fair! Don't leave <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> band! Don't make me kind of like this band and then leave it! That's bullshit!" ...|$|E

2500|$|While Martin was {{a soldier}} in the Roman army and {{stationed}} in Gaul (modern-day France), he experienced a vision, which became the most-repeated story about his life. One day as he was approaching the gates of the city of Amiens, he met a scantily clad beggar. He impulsively cut his military cloak in half to share with the man. That night, Martin dreamed of Jesus wearing the half-cloak he had given away. He heard Jesus say to the angels: [...] "Martin, who is still but a catechumen, clothed <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> robe." [...] (...) [...] In another version, when Martin woke, he found his cloak restored to wholeness. The dream confirmed Martin in his piety, and he was baptised at the age of 18.|$|E

2500|$|Video game {{journalist}} Lewis Denby stated {{it was a}} [...] "genuinely upsetting game" [...] and that, [...] "there's more to [...] existence {{than almost}} any other videogame character you'll ever meet". Independent game designer Derek Yu enjoyed the game, comparing its visual theme to EarthBound and stating [...] "The lack of dialogue or any action fills <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> strange sense of dread." [...] Gamertell's Jenni Lada scored the game 85 out of 100. She praised the unique premise, distinct art style and abstract gameplay which evokes a [...] "dream world experience". Lada noted the geometry of the dream areas, which allows for loops and exitless rooms, and found that it could be [...] "winding and confusing". Whilst she warned that it won't be to everyone's tastes due to [...] "dark or graphic imagery" [...] and found the ending to be disappointing, she concluded that Yume Nikki was worth experiencing. Kotaku's John Jackson praised the game for its ethereal dream-like setting and its non-linear gameplay mechanic, stating, [...] "Out of every game about dreams, {{this is the one that}} probably comes closest to actually resembling one." [...] He goes on to argue the game's limitations and vast, undefinable architecture forces the player to question their surroundings and the significance of the smallest actions and events that confront them.|$|E

2500|$|Star Treks {{contributions}} to TV history include giving women jobs of respect, most notably through the casting of Nichelle Nichols, a black actress, as Uhura, the ship's communications officer. Black actresses {{at that time}} on TV were almost always cast as servants.
