5|$|Finally, Rachel {{decides to}} return to her community. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Will</b> is bailed out of jail by Tim, who is looking for Rachel. Together, he and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Will</b> drive out to the community, and on the way they {{discover}} Clyde, whose van has broken down on the highway. As Rachel is about to be wed, Tim, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Will,</b> and Clyde pull {{up in front of the}} church in the red Mustang and rescue her. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Will</b> returns to the community and is accepted back with a confession that Rachel has recorded on the blue cassette, although she still firmly believes that God has fathered her child. Some months later, Clyde and a visibly pregnant Rachel are living in a tent by the beach and hold hands as they walk through the waves.|$|E
5|$|In Las Vegas Rachel {{falls in}} {{with a group of}} skaters who live {{together}} and play in a band, after becoming intrigued by one of the boys who wears a shirt with a cassette on it. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Will</b> finds her and pleads with her to confess to having sex with someone else so that he can return to their community. Rachel becomes romantically involved with Clyde, one of the skaters, and one night he offers to marry her, saying that together they can look for the man on the tape, who Rachel thinks is the father of her child. When Clyde and Rachel break into his parents' house looking for food and money, Clyde's father calls the police and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Will</b> is arrested while Rachel flees. Remembering one of her mother's bedtime stories, she impulsively follows a red Mustang and discovers that its owner, Tim, is the man who recorded the tape, and is, in fact, her biological father.|$|E

500|$|After her fifteenth birthday, Rachel McKnight, {{a member}} of a {{fundamentalist}} Mormon community in Utah, listens to a cassette recorder {{for the first time and}} hears a cover of [...] "Hanging on the Telephone" [...] by an obscure rock band on a blue cassette. Her brother, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Will,</b> takes it from her, stating that it is to be used only for God's purposes. When she discovers she is pregnant, she is convinced that she has conceived miraculously, like the Virgin Mary, through the medium of the cassette. After being questioned by her parents, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Will</b> is blamed for impregnating her, and is asked to leave the community, while Rachel is told she will be married the next day. Rather than undergo a shotgun marriage arranged by her father, Paul, she escapes to Las Vegas, along with <b>Mr.</b> <b>Will,</b> who is sleeping in the bed of the family's pickup truck.|$|E

60|$|It must {{be owned}} that Mr. Warrington {{continued}} to be witty the next morning. He sent a note to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Will</b> begging to know whether he was for a ride to town or anywheres else. If he was for London, that he would friten the highwaymen on Hounslow Heath, and look a very genteel figar at the Chocolate House. Which letter, I fear, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Will</b> received with his usual violence, requesting the writer to go to some place--not Hounslow.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Willing</b> was cautious. He {{took the}} name and address. [...] "I will see what can be done," [...] he said, non-committally. [...] "Is there {{anything}} else I can do?" ...|$|R

With congratulatory word he handed to her two telegrams, one addressed to her, {{the other to the}} bank. One was from the president of the Walnut Hills Trust Company.
