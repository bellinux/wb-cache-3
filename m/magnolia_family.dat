2500|$|Originally {{described}} by Linnaeus, Liriodendron tulipifera {{is one of}} two species (see also L.chinense) in the genus Liriodendron in the <b>magnolia</b> <b>family.</b> The name Liriodendron is Greek for [...] "lily tree".

2500|$|Tulip trees make magnificently shaped {{specimen}} trees, and {{are very}} large, growing to about [...] in good soil. They grow best in deep well-drained loam which has thick dark topsoil. They show stronger response to fertilizer compounds (those with low salt index are preferred) than most other trees, but soil structure and organic matter content are more important. In the wild it is occasionally seen around serpentine outcrops. The southeastern coastal plain and east central Florida ecotypes occur in wet but not stagnant soils which are high in organic matter. All tulip trees are unreliable in clay flats which are subject to ponding and flooding. Like {{other members of the}} <b>Magnolia</b> <b>family,</b> they have fleshy roots that are easily broken if handled roughly. Transplanting should be done in early spring, before leaf-out; this timing is especially important in the more northern areas. Fall planting is often successful in Florida. The east central Florida ecotype may be more easily moved than other strains because its roots grow over nine or ten months every year—several months longer than other ecotypes. Most tulip trees have low tolerance of drought, although Florida natives (especially the east central ecotype) fare better than southeastern coastal plain or northern inland specimens.|$|E

5000|$|The Magnoliaceae [...] are a {{flowering}} plant family, the <b>magnolia</b> <b>family,</b> {{in the order}} Magnoliales. It consists of two subfamilies:Magnolioideae, of which Magnolia is the most well-known genus, and Liriodendroidae, a monogeneric subfamily, of which Liriodendron (tulip trees) is the only genus.|$|E
50|$|The Magnoliaceae are {{an ancient}} family; fossil plants identifiably {{belonging}} to the Magnoliaceae date back 95 million years. A primitive aspect of the <b>Magnolia</b> <b>family</b> is that their large, cup-shaped flowers lack distinct petals or sepals. The large non-specialized flower parts, resembling petals, are called tepals.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{describes}} the alkaloids containing an isoquinoline or reduced isoquinoline ring-system. Structure determination and synthesis is discussed for the derivatives of isoquinoline and tetrahydroisoquinoline, which comprise {{of the simple}} tetrahydroisoquinolines, 1 -Phenyltetrahydroisoquinolines, such as the cryptostylines, cherylline, and papaverin, {{one of the principal}} alkaloids of opium. Also synthetic methods including biosynthesis are shown for the cularines, the dibenzopyrrocoline alkaloids, pavinanes and isopavinanes, the bisbenzylisoquinolines, aporphinoids, the protoberberines, the protopine alkaloids, the phthalideisoquinoline alkaloids, the rhoeadines and papaverrubines, the benzo[c]phenanthridines, the spirobenzylisoquinolines, the Ipecacuanha alkaloids, colchicine, and 1 -phenethylisoquinolines. It has become apparent, {{as the result of a}} large number of studies on the biosynthesis of the more highly condensed alkaloids of isoquinoline (protoberberins, protopines, aporphines, and so on) that norlaudanosoline may be regarded as the common precursor of all of them. The bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids, which are widely distributed in plants of the Menispermaceae family growing in South America and the Far East, and in Daphnandra, Berbis, <b>Magnolia</b> and Nectandra <b>families,</b> is one of the largest sub-groups of the isoquinoline alkaloids. The n. m. r, spectra of benzo[c]phenanthridines have attracted some attention, and are now of considerable importance in structural studies. The spectra of noravicine, nornitidine and norsanguinarine in trifluoracetic acid solution are highly characteristic...|$|R
5000|$|More {{severe weather}} {{developed}} across the Midwest on June 5. A few tornadoes developed primarily in Ohio that afternoon, {{but the most}} serious activity developed that evening. Several tornadoes took place in Iowa and more in Illinois. [...] One especially large tornado resulted in a tornado emergency being declared that evening for Peoria, Illinois after causing severe damage in Elmwood, Illinois. A second strong tornado formed shortly after the Elmwood, Illinois tornado in Putnam County just west of Henry, Illinois. The tornado tracked through southern La Salle County where it caused significant damage (EF2) in <b>Magnolia,</b> Illinois. A <b>family</b> of tornadoes (EF0, EF2, and EF3) struck the town of Streator, Illinois, resulting in widespread destruction throughout the area. Another tornado family (Two EF0's and one EF2) impacted Dwight, Illinois where 1 person was killed, numerous homes were destroyed, and a train was derailed. Later that night, a pair of twin tornadoes (EF1 and EF3) near St. Anne, Illinois destroyed many homes and mobile homes, snapped trees, demolished barns and farm equipment, and injured one person. Several more tornado warnings were issued in Southern Michigan that night, and into the early morning. Counties under warnings included Calhoun, Kalamazoo, Hillsdale, Jackson, Branch, Berrien, Van Buren, Saint Joseph, Washtenaw, Wayne, and Monroe counties. An EF1 tornado in Calhoun County touched down just south of Battle Creek, downing trees and tearing the roof off of a church. Other damage reported in Calhoun County included a flagpole bent at a right angle due to extreme winds in Homer. A damaging EF2 tornado struck the town of Dundee, Michigan where multiple businesses and a water park were damaged and 11 people were injured. Throughout the town, many trees were downed and homes were damaged or destroyed. A state of emergency was also declared for the town of Leamington, Ontario after extensive damage was reported across {{the southern part of}} Essex County, Ontario due to an F1 or possible F2 tornado confirmed by Environment Canada. Seven people were confirmed dead in Wood County, Ohio just outside Toledo after an EF4 tornado hit the town of Millbury, Ohio {{in the middle of the}} night.|$|R

While later abandoned, these arboretum plans involved paths leading through several hundred species of trees and shrubs. The plans were reworked for Morningside Park as The Kiel Arboretum, and was started with plantings of the trees from the Magnoliaceae (<b>magnolia)</b> <b>family</b> and shrubs from the Ranunculaceae (buttercup) and Berberidaceae (barberry) families.|$|E

40|$|Liriodendron is a genus of the <b>magnolia</b> <b>family</b> {{comprised}} of two flowering tree species that produce hardwoods of great ecological and economic value. However, {{only a limited}} amount of genetic research has been performed on the Liriodendron genus partly because transient or stable transgenic trees have been difficult to produce. In general, transient expression systems are indispensable for rapid, high-throughput screening and systematic characterization of gene functions at a low cost; therefore, development of such a system for Liriodendron would provide a necessary step forward for research on Magnoliaceae and other woody trees. Herein, we describe an efficient and rapid protocol for preparing protoplasts from the leaf mesophyll tissue of a Liriodendron hybrid and an optimized system for polyethylene glycol-mediated transient transfection of the protoplasts. Because the leaves of the Liriodendron hybrid are waxy, we formulated an enzyme mix containing 1. 5 % (w/v) Cellulase R- 10, 0. 5 % (w/v) Macerozyme R- 10, and 0. 1 % (w/v) Pectolyase Y- 23 to efficiently isolate protoplasts from the Liriodendron hybrid leaf mesophyll tissue in 3 h. We optimized Liriodendron protoplast transfection efficiency by including 20 μg plasmid DNA per 104 protoplasts, a transformation time of 20 min, and inclusion of 20 % (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000. After integrating the Liriodendron WOX 1 gene into pJIT 166 -GFP to produce a WOX 1 -GFP fusion product and transfecting it into isolated protoplasts, LhWOX 1 -GFP was found to localize to the nucleus according to its green fluorescence...|$|E
