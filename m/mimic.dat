5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{stands in}} {{semantic}} contrast with defensive mimicry, {{where it is}} the prey {{that acts as a}} <b>mimic,</b> with predators being duped. Defensive mimicry includes the well-known Batesian and Müllerian forms of mimicry, where the <b>mimic</b> shares outward characteristics with an aposematic or harmful model. In Batesian mimicry, the <b>mimic</b> is modeled on a dangerous (usually unpalatable) species, while in Müllerian mimicry both species are harmful, and act as comimics, converging on a common set of signals and sharing the burden of 'educating' their predators. Also included in defensive mimicry is the lesser known Mertensian mimicry, where the <b>mimic</b> is more harmful than the model, and Vavilovian mimicry, where weeds come to <b>mimic</b> crops through unintentional artificial selection. In defensive mimicry, the <b>mimic</b> benefits by avoiding a harmful interaction with another organism that {{would be more likely to}} take place without the deceptive signals employed. Harmful interactions might involve being eaten, or pulled out of the ground as a weed. In contrast, the aggressive <b>mimic</b> benefits from an interaction that would be less likely to take place without the deception, at the expense of its target.|$|E

5|$|Batesian mimicry {{is a case}} of {{protective}} or defensive mimicry, where the <b>mimic</b> does best by avoiding confrontations with the signal receiver. It is a disjunct system, which means that all three parties are from different species. Batesian mimicry stands in contrast to other forms such as aggressive mimicry, where the <b>mimic</b> profits from interactions with the signal receiver. One such case of this is in fireflies, where females of one species <b>mimic</b> the mating signals of another species, deceiving males to come close enough for them to eat. Mimicry need not involve a predator at all though. Such is the case in dispersal mimicry, where the <b>mimic</b> once again benefits from the encounter. For instance, some fungi have their spores dispersed by insects by smelling like carrion. In protective mimicry, the meeting between <b>mimic</b> and dupe is not such a fortuitous occasion for the <b>mimic,</b> and the signals it mimics tend to lower the probability of such an encounter.|$|E

40|$|<b>Mimics</b> of {{discontinuous}} epitopes of {{for example}} bacterial or viral proteins may have considerable {{potential for the}} development of synthetic vaccines, especially if conserved epitopes can be <b>mimicked.</b> However, due to the structural complexity and size of discontinuous epitopes molecular construction of these <b>mimics</b> remains challeging. We present here a convergent route for the assembly of discontinuous epitope <b>mimics</b> by successive azide alkyne cycloaddition on an orthogonal alkyne functionalized scaffold. Here the synthesis of <b>mimics</b> of the HIV gp 120 discontinuous epitope that interacts with the CD 4 receptor is described. The resulting protein <b>mimics</b> are capable of inhibition of the gp 120 -CD 4 interaction. The route is convergent, robust and should be applicable to other discontinuous epitopes...|$|R
40|$|Palatable (Batesian) <b>mimics</b> of {{unprofitable}} models {{could use}} behavioral mimicry {{to compensate for}} the ease with which they can be visually discriminated or to augment an already close morphological resemblance. We evaluated these contrasting predictions by assaying the behavior of 57 field-caught species of mimetic hover flies (Diptera: Syrphidae) and quantifying their morphological similarity to a range of potential hymenopteran models. A purpose-built phylogeny for the hover flies was used to control for potential lack of independence due to shared evolutionary history. Those hover fly species that engage in behavioral mimicry (mock stinging, leg waving, wing wagging) were all large wasp <b>mimics</b> within the genera Spilomyia and Temnostoma. While the behavioral <b>mimics</b> assayed were good morphological <b>mimics,</b> not all good <b>mimics</b> were behavioral <b>mimics.</b> Therefore, while the behaviors may have evolved to augment good morphological mimicry, they do not advantage all good <b>mimics...</b>|$|R
40|$|Batesian mimicry is when an {{innocuous}} species avoids predation by <b>mimicking</b> a defended, harmful species (known as the model). It {{is expected}} that natural selection should be towards ever more accurate <b>mimics,</b> but, puzzlingly, mimicry is often imprecise. One hypothesis that could explain some inaccurate mimicry is that some <b>mimics</b> might be generalist <b>mimics</b> {{of more than one}} model species, rather than specialist <b>mimics.</b> Using an online game with humans acting as predators it is shown that in some circumstances intermediate <b>mimics</b> of two models are more protected from predation than specialist <b>mimics</b> of either model. In order to understand why imperfect mimicry persists, we need to know which aspects of the <b>mimic’s</b> appearance are salient to their predators. Humans acting as predators in an online quiz are shown to gain the most information about whether an insect is a defended wasp or an undefended wasp-mimicking hoverfly from the shape of the insect’s abdomen. It is also shown that humans appear {{to pay more attention to}} the abdomen’s colour than its shape...|$|R
5|$|In Batesian mimicry the <b>mimic</b> shares signals {{similar to}} the model, but {{does not have the}} {{attribute}} that makes it unprofitable to predators (e.g., unpalatability). In other words, a Batesian <b>mimic</b> is a sheep in wolf's clothing. It is named after Henry Walter Bates, an English naturalist whose work on butterflies in the Amazon rainforest (described in The Naturalist on the River Amazons) was pioneering in this field of study. Mimics {{are less likely to be}} found out (for example by predators) when in low proportion to their model. This phenomenon is called negative frequency dependent selection, and it applies in most forms of mimicry. Batesian mimicry can only be maintained if the harm caused to the predator by eating a model outweighs the benefit of eating a <b>mimic.</b> The nature of learning is weighted in favor of the mimics, for a predator that has a bad first experience with a model tends to avoid anything that looks like it for a long time, and does not re-sample soon to see whether the initial experience was a false negative. However, if mimics become more abundant than models, then the probability of a young predator having a first experience with a <b>mimic</b> increases. Such systems are therefore most likely to be stable where both the model and the <b>mimic</b> occur, and where the model is more abundant than the <b>mimic.</b> This is not the case in Müllerian mimicry, which is described next.|$|E

5|$|Mimicry {{occurs when}} an {{organism}} (the <b>mimic)</b> simulates signal properties of another organism (the model) to confuse a third organism. This {{results in the}} <b>mimic</b> gaining protection, food, and mating advantages. There are two classical types of defensive mimicry: Batesian and Müllerian. Both involve aposematic coloration, or warning signals, to avoid being attacked by a predator.|$|E
40|$|Our {{aim is to}} give a {{comparative}} analysis of ability of different factor <b>mimicking</b> portfolios in representing the background factors. Our analysis contains a cross-sectional regression approach, a time-series regression approach and a portfolio approach for constructing factor <b>mimicking</b> portfolios. The focus of the analysis {{is the power of}} <b>mimicking</b> portfolios in the asset pricing models. We conclude that the time series regression approach, with the book-to-market sorted portfolios as the base assets, is the most proper alternative to construct <b>mimicking</b> portfolios for factors for which a time-series of factor realisation is available. To construct <b>mimicking</b> portfolios based on the firm characteristics we suggest a loading weighted portfolio approach. <b>mimicking</b> portfolio; asset pricing; cross-sectional regression approach; time series regression approach...|$|R
25|$|The {{question}} is, how can {{the differences}} between social wasp <b>mimics</b> and bumblebee <b>mimics</b> be explained? Evidently if model species are common, and have overlapping distributions, {{they are less likely}} to be polymorphic. Their <b>mimics</b> are widespread and develop a kind of rough and ready jack-of-all-trades mimicry. But if model species are less common and have patchy distribution they develop polymorphism; and their <b>mimics</b> match them more exactly and are polymorphic also.

5|$|Non-aposematic {{species have}} often evolved to <b>mimic</b> the {{conspicuous}} markings of their aposematic counterparts. For example, the hornet moth is a <b>mimic</b> of the yellowjacket wasp; it resembles the wasp, {{but has no}} sting. A predator which avoids the wasp will to some degree also avoid the moth. This is known as Batesian mimicry, after Henry Walter Bates, a British naturalist who studied Amazonian butterflies {{in the second half}} of the 19th century. Batesian mimicry is frequency dependent: it is most effective when the ratio of <b>mimic</b> to model is low; otherwise, predators learn to recognise the impostors.|$|E
5|$|The {{model is}} usually another species, except in automimicry, where {{members of the}} species <b>mimic</b> other members, or other parts of their own bodies, and in inter-sexual mimicry, where members of one sex <b>mimic</b> members of the other.|$|E

5|$|Aggressive mimicry is {{opposite}} {{in principle}} to defensive mimicry, where the <b>mimic</b> generally benefits from being treated as harmful.

40|$|Many predators are {{averse to}} attacking ants and many {{palatable}} arthropods are Batesian <b>mimics</b> of ants. We considered whether aggregating Batesian <b>mimics</b> of ants can become more repelling to ant-averse predators by, as a group, resembling groups of ants (collective mimicry). Myrmarachne melanotarsa is a gregarious ant-like jumping spider (Salticidae) that resembles and associates with the ant Crematogaster sp. We used three large ant-averse salticids as predators in experiments. Besides M. melanotarsa and Crematogaster we used midges (Chaoborus sp.) {{and a small}} nonant-like, but gregarious, salticid (Menemerus sp.) as prey. The predators readily attacked both live midges and the nonant-like salticids that were presented singly or in groups but rarely attacked ants or ant <b>mimics.</b> Predators attacked ants and ant <b>mimics</b> presented in groups less often than they attacked solitary ants and ant <b>mimics.</b> In another experiment, motionless lures (groups of arthropods mounted in lifelike posture) were used. The findings showed that, independent of prey behaviour and movement, the predators were averse to being {{in close proximity to}} groups of ants and ant <b>mimics,</b> but had no evident aversion to the close proximity of groups of nonant-like salticids. Palatability tests demonstrated that the predators fed for long periods on M. melanotarsa, Menemerus and Chaoborus, but released Crematogaster almost immediately. Our results suggest that these predators have an innate aversion to ants and ant <b>mimics</b> and also that they are innately predisposed to perceive a group of ants (or ant <b>mimics)</b> as more repelling than solitary ants or ant <b>mimics.</b> 7 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Given a capacitated {{undirected graph}} G = (V,E) {{with a set}} of {{terminals}} K ⊂ V, a <b>mimicking</b> network is a smaller graph H = (VH, EH) that exactly preserves all the minimum cuts between the terminals.

This notion of a <b>mimicking</b> network was introduced by Hagerup, Katajainen, Nishimura and Ragde [HKNR 95] who also exhibited a <b>mimicking</b> network of size 22 k for every graph with k terminals.

In this work, we improve both the upper and lower bounds reducing the doubly-exponential gap between them to a single-exponential gap.

40|$|Batesian mimicry evolves when a {{palatable}} species (the ‘mimic’) co-opts {{a warning}} signal from a dangerous species (the ‘model’) and thereby deceives its potential predators.
