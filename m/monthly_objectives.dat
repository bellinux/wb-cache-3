40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "DOD and the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) have defined the mission and broad goals for Security Force Assistance (SFA) advisor teams; however, teams varied in {{the extent to which}} their approaches for developing their Afghan National Security Force (ANSF) units identified activities based on specific objectives or end states that were clearly linked with established goals. SFA guidance states that to be successful, advisors must have an end or goal in mind, and establish objectives that support higher-command plans. Theater commanders have outlined goals aimed at strengthening specific capabilities such as logistics, and it is largely left to the teams to then develop their approach for working with their counterparts. GAO found some advisor teams had developed structured advising approaches drawing from these goals, such as identifying <b>monthly</b> <b>objectives</b> and milestones for their team. Other teams GAO met with used less structured approaches, such as relying on interactions with ANSF counterparts to identify priorities and using this input to develop activities on an ad hoc basis, rather than as part of a longer-term, more structured approach to achieve broad goals. Officials from several teams stated that the guidance they received lacked specificity regarding desired end states for the development of their ANSF counterpart units. Without a more structured approach with clear linkages between end states, objectives, and milestones that are in support of broad goals for ANSF units, theater commanders cannot be assured that the advisor team activities are making progress toward these goals. ...|$|E
40|$|Background Medication {{organisation}} devices (MODs) provide compartments for a patient’s {{medication to}} be organised into {{the days of}} the week and the recommended times the medication should be taken. Aim To define the optimal trial design for testing the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of MODs. Design The feasibility study comprised a systematic review and focus groups to inform a randomised controlled trial (RCT) design. The resulting features were tested on a small scale, using a 2 × 2 factorial design to compare MODs with usual packaging and to compare weekly with monthly supply. The study design was then evaluated. Setting Potential participants were identified by medical practices. Participants Aged over 75 years, prescribed at least three solid oral dosage form medications, unintentionally non-adherent and self-medicating. Participants were excluded if deemed by their health-care team to be unsuitable. Interventions One of three MODs widely used in routine clinical practice supplied either weekly or <b>monthly.</b> <b>Objectives</b> To identify the most effective method of participant recruitment, to estimate the prevalence of intentional and unintentional non-adherence in an older population, to provide a point estimate of the effect size of MODs relative to usual care and to determine the feasibility and acceptability of trial participation. Methods The systematic review included MOD studies of any design reporting medication adherence, health and social outcomes, resource utilisation or dispensing or administration errors. Focus groups with patients, carers and health-care professionals supplemented the systematic review to inform the RCT design. The resulting design was implemented and then evaluated through questionnaires and group discussions with participants and health-care professionals involved in trial delivery. Results Studies on MODs are largely of poor quality. The relationship between adherence and health outcomes is unclear. Of the limited studies reporting health outcomes, some reported a positive relationship while some reported increased hospitalisations associated with MODs. The pre-trial focus groups endorsed the planned study design, but suggested a minimum recruitment age of 50 – 60 years. A total of 35. 4 % of patients completing the baseline questionnaire were excluded because they already used a MOD. Active recruitment yielded a higher consent rate, but passive recruitment was more cost-effective. The prevalence of intentional non-adherence was 24. 7 % [n = 71, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 19. 7 % to 29. 6 %] of participants. Of the remaining 76 participants, 46. 1 % (95 % CI 34. 8 % to 57. 3 %) were unintentionally non-adherent. There was no indication of a difference in adherence between the study arms. Participants reported a high level of satisfaction with the design. Five adverse/serious adverse events were identified in the MOD study arms and none was identified in the control arms. There was no discernible difference in health economic outcomes between the four study arms; the mean intervention cost was £ 20 per month greater for MOD monthly relative to usual supply monthly. Conclusions MOD provision to unintentionally non-adherent older people may cause medication-related adverse events. The primary outcome for a definitive MOD trial should be health outcomes. Such a trial should recruit patients by postal invitation and recruit younger patients. Future work A study examining the association between MOD initiation and adverse effects is necessary and a strategy to safely introduce MODs should be explored. A definitive study testing the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of MODs is also required...|$|E

Substantial development {{was needed for}} some of the quality control algorithms although the checks were based on documented procedures used elsewhere where appropriate. A new automated ship track check was developed: the results of an undetected position error can be very damaging to ocean analyses. Also important is a check against a gridded background, this can be a climatology but near the surface it is advantageous to use an estimate that is evolving over time. Bayesian probability theory is used in the background check and the associated check against nearby observations (buddy check). The system was used to process archive data for 1956 – 2004. As a by-product <b>monthly</b> model-free <b>objective</b> analyses for this period were produced.

The index was then used as an additional constraint in the model besides the conventional constraints on reservoir safety. During model solving, different criteria were applied to the index, representing various degrees of alteration of the natural flow regime in the river. Through the model, a relationship between social-economic interests and flow alteration degree was established. Finally, a trade-off solution of the reservoir operation was defined that led to a favorable social-economic benefit at an acceptable alteration of the natural flow...|$|R

The <b>objective</b> is to estimate the employment adjustment function, which relates the magnitude of em-ployment changes {{to the size of}} employment gaps. The empirical results point to the presence of nonconvexities in employment adjustment costs in Brazilian manufacturing, with estimated employment adjustment rates increasing with the size of employment gaps. On average, employment adjustment rates range from 10 % for small employment gaps to 35 % for large ones. The results also show that there is a large proportion of firms in the sample that do not adjust employment over two consecutive periods. We run several robustness tests with alternative ways of estimating the employment gaps, using other forms of dealing with measurement error and a problem of endogeneity of the hours change variable.

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Two Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Gliders have alternated {{continuous}} sampling of a 45 -nautical mile transect line (the Newport Hydrographic Line) across the Oregon continental shelf since April, 2006. Strong currents (> 25 cm/s) push the gliders off their trajectories as they survey this transect line, {{preventing them from}} sampling the historically occupied stations exactly. Three methods were used to map the semi-regular glider data onto a cross-shelf line: (1) an algorithm that groups data by isobaths then block-averages the data, (2) an objective analysis that employs fixed along-isobath and cross-isobath correlation scales, and (3) a hybrid combination of the isobath-binning algorithm and objective analysis. To determine validity and accuracy, the mapping procedures are tested by comparison to moored observations at NH- 10 on the Newport Line in 80 m water depth while varying the spatial and temporal averaging scales. Isobath binning showed the best agreement with moored observations at the <b>monthly</b> timescale, while <b>objective</b> analysis showed the best agreement with moored observations at the weekly timescale. The hybrid method improved the agreement of the objective analysis at larger timescales...|$|R

40|$|Background: Striae are linear atrophic {{depressions}} {{that form}} {{in areas of}} dermal damage in the skin. As on date, no consensus or protocol exists {{for the treatment of}} stria rubra. Topical retinoids, chemical peels, microdermabrasion, radiofrequency, photothermolysis, intense pulsed light and lasers are some of the modalities used. Aims and Objective: To compare the efficacy of various therapeutic modalities in striae rubra. Methods: This prospective cohort study comprised of a total of fifty patients from August- 2012 to October- 2013 in a tertiary care center in Western India, Gujarat having striae rubra. They were randomly divided into five groups of ten patients each. Patients were evaluated on the basis of visual assessment, both by doctor as well as the patient. Group I was given topical tretinoin (0. 1 % w/w) gel applied once at night, Group II-microdermabrasion (MDA) combined with trichloroacetic acid (TCA) (30 %) peel, Group III-mesotherapy, Group IV-Q-switched Nd: YAG laser, and Group V-combination treatment of microdermabrasion, salicylic acid peel and retinol (yellow) peel. Patients were treated at an interval of 15 days for 2 months and then at <b>monthly</b> intervals. <b>Objective</b> assessment was done at 2 nd month, 6 th month, {{and at the end of}} 1 st year. Results: Patients in Group I treated with topical tretinoin showed the least response with 80 % (8) of them showing minimal clinical improvement (0 – 25 %) as compared to patients in Group V in which 60 % (6) patients showed moderate clinical improvement (50 – 75 %). While majority of the patients in Group II, III, and IV showed mild clinical improvement (25 – 50 %). Conclusions: Striae rubra is a common cause of concern for adolescent population.

40|$|In South Africa, linefishing {{increased}} in the mid- 1800 s and eventually reached a peak in the 1980 s/ 90 s. A legal linefishery emergency was declared in 2000 {{in accordance with the}} Marine Living Resources Act of 1998. This was a large blow for the commercially important industry. Nonetheless, the carpenter stocks had already been overexploited to such a high degree by linefishing, and also as part of trawling bycatch, that even at an effort {{less than half of the}} effort that produces a maximum sustainable yield, carpenter stocks were still found below the biomass found at the maximum sustainable yield. In order to explore three different management strategies for the carpenter stock on the offshore Central Agulhas Bank, an agestructured, non-stochastic model was set up. The influences of the following strategies - Total Allowable Catch (TAC), as well as revised minimum size limit and closed season – on a stock found at a dismal 19. 2 % of carrying capacity, are projected using this model on a <b>monthly</b> time-step. The <b>objectives</b> of this fishery are to achieve a biomass in the final year equal to the biomass found at a maximum sustainable yield (7243 t) and to maximise effort (employment) and catch. The overall recommendation for this stock was a reduction in minimum size limit from 35 cm to 30. 48 cm in combination with a flexible TAC starting at 790 t. It is also recommended that even though models are important for fisheries management, no model should be taken in isolation without first considering life history traits and other important information about a stock...|$|R
40|$|<b>Objectives</b> <b>Monthly</b> {{hospitalization}} {{rates in}} Saskatchewan from January 1979 to December 1989 {{were examined in}} order to see if they exhibited a seasonal pattern. The agegroups studied were 0 - 4, 5 - 14, 15 - 34, 35 - 49 and 50 - 64. Male and females rates, as well as native and non-native patterns were compared to see if the patterns differed by sex or race. Methods The method used was that of decomposing the time series into its trend, seasonal and error component, using an additive model. The significance of the components was tested using a two-way ANOVA. Results The monthly asthma hospitalization rates for non-natives in Sakatchewan did exhibit seasonal variation. The pattern seen was that of a spring and fall peak in the children, a fall peak in young adults and a winter-spring peak in the older groups. There was a difference between the sexes among the adults. Women seem to be more affected by the aeroallergens in spring than men. The 35 - 49 year old men did not have a statistically significant seasonal pattern, whereas the women did. The native and non-native patterns compared {{for the first time in}} this study, do show different patterns for the different populations. Only the oldest group had the same seasonal pattern as seen in the non-natives. Conclusions: Asthma hospitalization rates for non-natives in Saskatchewan do exhibit seasonal patterns. The results are similar to those seen in other parts of the world. The sex specific patterns for the age groups studied do not seem to have been examined before. The adult sex specific patterns did indicate some differences between the sexes. The native and non-native patterns were also quite different.

40|$|In 1994, racial {{domination}} in {{the form}} of apartheid ended in South Africa and the first postapartheid government was elected through a non-racial and democratic franchise. The new government inherited an entrenched system of racial inequality as well as widespread poverty amongst the formerly oppressed population, and it sought to address these challenges through policies of redistribution based on a new progressive constitution which emphasised the realisation of socio-economic rights. At the same time, and despite its redistributive measures, the post-apartheid government has pursued a macro-economic strategy with pronounced neoliberal dimensions. One of its critical redistributive measures focuses on social assistance to poor blacks, and this has entailed the construction and expansion of a massive social grant system including the child support grant which is received by millions of black South Africans on a <b>monthly</b> basis. The <b>objective</b> of this thesis is to examine and understand the livelihoods of child support grant recipients (or caregivers) in the context of conditions of extreme vulnerability marked by poverty. It does so by focusing on the small town of Riebeek East located in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Though undoubtedly child support grant caregivers are victims of poverty, the thesis demonstrates that they are not without agency. They exist in structural conditions of vulnerability and poverty, but they nevertheless seek to manoeuvre and negotiate their way in and through their conditions of existence. This does not necessarily alleviate their poverty in any significant manner but it does show evidence of reflexivity, decision-making and responsibility in the pursuit of livelihood practices and outcomes. In making this argument, I draw upon the mega-theory of Margaret Archer (specifically, her morphogenetic approach) and the more middle-level perspective of the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework. Beyond contributing to the prevailing academic literature on the child support grant in South Africa, this thesis also hopefully makes a small contribution to controversies about structure and agency within sociology...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{sustainability}} of planned water uses in mesoscale river basins under multiple climate change scenarios, and contributes to determining the possible causes of unsustainability. We propose an assessment grounded in real-world water management issues, with water management scenarios built in collaboration with local water agencies. Furthermore, we present an analysis through indicators that relate to management goals and present the implications of climate uncertainty for our results, furthering the significance of our study for water management. A modeling framework integrating hydro-climatic and human dynamics and accounting for interactions between resource and demand was applied in two basins of different scales and with contrasting water uses: the Herault (2500  km 2, France) and the Ebro (85   000  km 2, Spain) basins. Natural streamflow was evaluated using a conceptual hydrological model. A demand-driven reservoir management model was designed to account for streamflow regulations from the main dams. Human water demand was estimated from time series of demographic, socioeconomic and climatic data. Environmental flows were accounted for by defining streamflow thresholds under which withdrawals were strictly limited. Finally indicators comparing water availability to demand at strategic resource and demand nodes were computed. This framework was applied under different combinations of climatic and water use scenarios for the mid- 21 st to differentiate the impacts of climate- and human-induced changes on streamflow and water balance. Results showed that <b>objective</b> <b>monthly</b> environmental flows would be guaranteed in current climate conditions in both basins, yet in several areas this could imply limiting human water uses more than once every 5 years. The impact of the tested climate projections on both water availability and demand could question the water allocations and environmental requirements currently planned for the coming decades. Water shortages for human use could become more frequent and intense, and the pressure on water resources and aquatic ecosystems could intensify. The causes of unsustainability vary across sub-basins and scenarios, and in most areas results are highly dependent on the climate change scenario...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The National Institute of Social Services for Retirees and Pensioners (NISSRP) is a {{nationwide}} {{health care financing}} agency and service provider in Argentina. Among its services, the NISSRP provides outpatient drug coverage to more than 3. 3 million beneficiaries, mainly senior citizens and disabled persons. In 1997, to help cope with its rising costs, the NISSRP agreed to transfer the risk {{for the cost of}} outpatient medications and cancer-treatment drugs to a consortium of pharmaceutical companies in exchange for a fixed <b>monthly</b> payment. The <b>objective</b> {{of this study was to}} determine the impact that this new approach had on three things: (1) the level of expenditures for the medicines that were included in the agreement, (2) the pattern of nonrational prescribing for NISSRP beneficiaries, and (3) this pattern's relationship with macroeconomic variables and the pattern of prescribing for Argentina as a whole. METHODS: We compared outpatient-medicine consumption in 1999 with consumption before the agreement went into effect. RESULTS: The actual amount that NISSRP beneficiaries spent out-of-pocket climbed from US$ 336. 13 million in 1996 to US$ 473. 36 million in 1999, an increase of almost 41 %. The nominal amount "spent" by the NISSRP in 1999 was US$ 601. 11 million, versus a real amount of US$ 374. 75 million in 1996, an "increase" of 60 % (that increase for the NISSRP was only theoretical since the agreement specified the fixed monthly amount that the NISSRP would have to pay to the pharmaceutical consortium). In contrast with the increased real spending by NISSRP beneficiaries, Argentina's economy remained stable over the assessed period, with the consumer price index even falling by 0. 8 %. We found high levels of nonrational drug use in the NISSRP system in both 1996 and 1999, indicating a serious ongoing problem. CONCLUSIONS: An agreement with pharmaceutical companies, like the one we have described, might add an element of financial predictability for institutions such as the NISSRP. However, such an agreement can easily result in an increased economic burden for health care beneficiaries, and without any improvement in the services that they receive. This type of agreement requires extensive mechanisms for control, follow-up, and updating, and it also risks making nonrational drug prescribing the accepted rule. While perhaps feasible, the requirements for this kind of agreement are actually very difficult to put into place, requiring additional efforts from institutions such as the NISSRP...|$|R
