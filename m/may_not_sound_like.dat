5000|$|The LOADER loads the camera, oddly enough, with film made {{by either}} Kodak or Fuji. Loading <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> {{much of a}} job, but in {{actuality}} it is very important. If the wrong film is in the camera, or if it gets loaded twice, or lost, or put in the wrong can, then the scene which corresponded to: Scene 56 - The Army advanced over the hill, the jets dropped their bombs, and the volcano erupted... could be lost. When this happens the Loader can become deeply unpopular very quickly. Kubrick fired one loader I know {{on his first day}} of work for walking across the set holding a magazine upside down. Not Kubrick’s first day of work - the Loader's. This was a trifle harsh, but there is a right way to do the job, and the rules are there for a very good reason. If you screw up the minimum cost is about $20,000 and the max any figure you might care to imagine.|$|E

He batted [...]331 with 8 hrs (13 on the season) in 52 games with the New Orleans Zephyrs of the PCL to give the Mets a reason to keep him for another year. He returned to the Major Leagues for 4 games with the Mets in 2009, going 1 for 4.

He spent most of the season with the Buffalo Bisons of the International League, hitting [...]259 in 50 games. He spent the majority of the season on the disabled list and had rehabilitation assignments with the GCL Mets and the Brooklyn Cyclones of the New York-Penn League.|$|E
5000|$|Nutshell {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} book critics. Book Marks, the review aggregator of Literary Hub, assigned the book an average grade of B+. In The Guardian, Kate Clanchy began by admitting: [...] "This <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> an entirely promising read: a talking foetus {{could be an}} unconvincing or at least tiresomely limited narrator, and updatings of Shakespeare often strain at their own seams. From the start, though, McEwan manages to establish both the groggy, gripping parameters of the uterus - My limbs are folded hard across my chest, my head is wedged into my only exit. I wear my mother like a tight-fitting cap - and that this foetus, Hamlet-style, is king of infinite space". She found the book’s retelling of Hamlet to have [...] "a strong forward momentum" [...] and {{to be not only}} a [...] "brutally effective" [...] thriller, [...] "but many other sorts of book too". Despite finding some faults with the novels social satire, characterisation, and portrayal of contemporary life, she concluded that [...] "… the architecture wins. This book is organised so thoroughly, in its plot, characters and themes, around the central image of the foetus suspended in the churnings of gravity and time …. Like TS Eliots [...] "Marina", also a riff on Shakespeare, it is a consciously late, deliberately elegiac, masterpiece, a calling together of everything McEwan has learned and knows about his art." ...|$|E

40|$|I love language. I {{love the}} intricacies of its structure, its ability to {{communicate}} ideas {{and the beauty of}} a good utterance. I‟ve been fascinated with the ease with which we understand certain ideas, and the difficulty we face when trying to interpret others since I became an adult. And I am not alone; as can be witnessed if you leaf through any psychology text book, major philosophical work or check out your local bookstore. We are fascinated by it, as we should be. It surrounds our everyday life, when watching the TV, listening to the radio, surfing the internet or, most importantly when talking to other people. For me the different languages are the ultimate expression of communal artwork. We talk about statues as being permanent, but it has nothing on language. The languages we are using now <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> the languages of our ancestors, but it is the same work of art, continually changing as new artists lay their linguistic brushes at its tapestry. In the end this is why, even though I started out with the natural sciences, mathematics and computer technology, I had to study theoretical linguistics.

30|$|An {{attribute}} {{common to}} these cases {{is that each}} SEC director holds a PhD in a STEM discipline and is jointly appointed as a faculty member, facilitating their ability to build partnerships within STEM departments. The data show these SEC directors seek to bridge the different disciplinary priorities by bringing faculty together to share common goals and envision opportunities for synergies (Additional file 1, row 3 b). Collaborations and partnerships developed through the SEC were key to establishing a viable network. Cross-case data shows SEC networks {{to be an important}} resource through which they contributed to the expansion of institutional efforts (Additional file 1, row 3 c). “The way I think about it – it’s like building a map of where efforts are going on, and then I/we build a Network to link those efforts. I also ask ‘how can I make it better?’, and what can we share with the rest of campus” (SEC Director, Institution E 3)? This important role is echoed by the VPR from Institution F 3, who describes his institution’s need for this service. “This <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a big deal, but it’s a big deal to me and it’s a big deal to the University that (SEC Director’s name) has the pulse of what’s going on. She is networked with what’s going on in the campus. She has a network, and the connectivity. I rely on the Center for that service, and I know others do as well.” Analyses show that these SECs are well positioned to build partnerships because they work across the disciplines developing broad awareness of current departmental efforts, interests, and strengths, which they interface with institutional needs. A description of how these SECs use their partnerships and community is described in the following sections, beginning with meeting the needs of students.|$|E
40|$|With the {{increasing}} {{focus on the}} greenhouse effect {{and the introduction of}} taxation on NOX and CO 2 emissions there has been an increased interest in reducing the emissions from the offshore oil and gas installations to bring down the operating costs. This makes the possible use of combined cycles as a source for power production offshore of great immediate interest. Compared to the simple cycle gas turbines typically used offshore today, combined cycles offer a significantly improved thermal efficiency and as such reduced emissions and fuel consumption. However, the large weight and area requirements for combined cycles are a concern; for offshore applications a compact system is needed. This thesis is an extension of the project work Process simulation of combined cycles for offshore applications, written autumn 2012, and focuses on optimizing the design developed in that work. The design parameters for the system developed in the project work were optimized in MATLAB using a connection between MATLAB and a Microsoft Excel spread sheet linked with GT PRO. The thesis includes the development of an objective function and a screening of the potential MATLAB optimization methods. After the optimization methods were decided upon, adjustments were made to them in an attempt to improve the optimized solution, and a brief comparison of the different optimization methods was carried out. Finally, the best solution was compared to that of the project work, both in respect to the individual design parameters and total system performance. Through this thesis it has become apparent that the selection of objective function is of paramount importance, the optimized solution will only be as good as the selected function. In terms of the optimization methods, there were fairly small differences between the various algorithms, though the pattern search with a MADSPositiveBasis 2 N search algorithm seemed to be a good option for obtaining the best possible solution. In comparison to the design developed in the project work, there were noticeable improvements to be had in terms of power production and weight savings. Overall, the main components of the optimized solution were 493 kg lighter and able to produce an additional 268 kW when compared to the project work, corresponding to a 2. 6 % improvement {{in the value of the}} selected objective function. This <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> much, but the cumulative savings over the lifetime of an installation may become quite significant. Overall it appears to be quite advantageous to optimize the design of combined cycles for offshore oil and gas installations. Once a suitable objective function is established a quite good optimized solution can be realized in relatively short time. It does not appear to be necessary with many adjustments to the optimization parameters, though adjustments can be made if a better solution is sought after. </p...|$|E
