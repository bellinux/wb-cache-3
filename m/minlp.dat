40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{optimization}} problems arising from engineering applications can be formulated as Mixed Integer NonLinear Programmming problems (<b>MINLPs).</b> Duran and Grossmann (1986) suggest an outer approximation scheme for solving a class of <b>MINLPs</b> that are linear in the integer variables by a finite sequence of relaxed MILP master programs and NLP subproblems. Their idea is generalized by treating nonlinearities in the integer variables directly, which allows a much wider class of problem to be tackled, including the case of pure INLPs. A new and more simple proof of finite termination is given and a rigorous treatment of infeasible NLP subproblems is presented which includes all the common methods for resolving infeasibility in Phase I. The worst case performance of the outer approximation algorithm is investigated and an example is given for which it visits all integer assignments.

40|$|Evolutionary {{computation}} (EC) {{techniques such}} as genetic algorithms (GAs), utilize multiple searching points in the solution space like PSO. Whereas GAs can treat combinatorial optimization problems, PSO was aimed to treat nonlinear optimization problems with continuous variables originally. Moreover, PSO has been expanded to handle combinatorial optimization problems and both discrete and continuous variables as well. Efficient treatment of mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problems (<b>MINLPs)</b> {{is one of the}} most difficult problems in practical optimization. Moreover, unlike other EC techniques, PSO can be realized with only a small program; namely, PSO can handle <b>MINLPs</b> with only a small program. This feature of PSO is one of its advantages compared with other optimization techniques. In this paper, the basic PSO method is combined with Newton’s method, and interior point method for the optimal power flow/volt-var optimization. The results obtained on IEEE 30 -bus system showed that the hybrid method based on PSO-IPM gives the best results compared to the other methods proposed in this chapter.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study {{selected}} topics {{in the field}} of Mixed Integer Programming (MIP), in particular Mixed Integer Linear and Nonlinear Programming (MI(N) LP). We set a focus on the influences of Constraint Programming (CP). First, we analyze Mathematical Programming approaches to water network optimization, a set of challenging optimization problems frequently modeled as non-convex <b>MINLPs.</b> We give detailed descriptions of many variants and survey solution approaches from the literature. We are particularly interested in MILP approximations and present a respective computational study for water network design problems. We analyze this approach by algorithmic considerations and highlight the importance of certain convex substructures in these non-convex <b>MINLPs.</b> We further derive valid inequalities for water network design problems exploiting these substructures. Then, we treat Mathematical Programming problems with indicator constraints, recalling their most popular reformulation techniques in MIP, leading to either big-M constraints or disjunctive programming techniques. The latter give rise to reformulations in higher-dimensional spaces, and we review special cases from the literature that allow to describe the projection on the original space of variables explicitly. We theoretically extend the respective results in two directions and conduct computational experiments. We then present an algorithm for MILPs with indicator constraints that incorporates elements of CP into MIP techniques, including computational results for the JobShopScheduling problem. Finally, we introduce an extension of the class of MILPs so that linear expressions are allowed to have non-contiguous domains. Inspired by CP, this permits to model holes in the domains of variables as a special case. For such problems, we extend the theory of split cuts and show two ways of separating them, namely as intersection and lift-and-project cuts, and present computational results. We further experiment with an exact algorithm for such problems, applied to the Traveling Salesman Problem with multiple time windows...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we propose}} a cutting plane {{algorithm}} to improve optimization models that are originally formulated as convex Generalized Disjunctive Programs (GDP).

The (HR) reformulation {{can be further}} strengthened, by using the concept of basic step from disjunctive programming. The proposed algorithm uses the strengthened formulation to derive cuts for the Big-M formulation, generating a stronger formulation with small growth in problem size. We test the algorithm with several instances.

In general, the algorithm also leads to a reduction in the solution time of the problems...|$|R
40|$|Local {{branching}} is {{an improvement}} heuristic, developed {{within the context}} of branch-and-bound algorithms for MILPs, which has proved to be very effective in practice. For the binary case, it is based on defining a neighbourhood of the current incumbent solution by allowing only a few binary variables to flip their value, through the addition of a local branching constraint. The neighbourhood is then explored with a branch-and-bound solver. We propose a local branching scheme for (nonconvex) <b>MINLPs</b> which is based on iteratively solving MILPs and NLPs. Preliminary computational experiments show that this approach is able to improve the incumbent solution on the majority of the test instances, requiring only a short CPU time. Moreover, we provide algorithmic ideas for a primal heuristic whose purpose is to find a first feasible solution, based on the same scheme. ...|$|R

40|$|Modeling decision-dependent {{scenario}} probabilities in stochastic {{programs is}} difficult and typically leads to large and highly non-linear <b>MINLPs</b> that {{are very difficult to}} solve. In this paper, we develop a new approach to obtain a compact representation of the recourse function using a set of binary decision diagrams (BDDs) that encode a nested cover of the scenario set. The resulting BDDs can then be used to efficiently characterize the decision-dependent scenario probabilities by a set of linear inequalities, which essentially factorizes the probability distribution and thus allows to reformulate the entire problem as a small mixed-integer linear program. The approach is applicable to a large class of stochastic programs with multivariate binary scenario sets, such as stochastic network design, network reliability, or stochastic network interdiction problems. Computational results show that the BDD-based scenario representation reduces the problem size, and hence the computation time, significant compared to previous approaches.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{explores the}} effect of the horizon of {{foresight}} on future inflows on the minimum reservoir capacity required for meeting a specified yield. The goal is achieved by formulating the problem as a series of finite-horizon mixed integer linear programs (MILPs), each with a limited, partial foresight on future inflows. The <b>MINLPs</b> are then solved sequentially over a long-run planning horizon for determining the minimum reservoir capacity required for meeting a specified reservoir yield at a certain level of reliability. The results indicate although it is generally true that the required reservoir capacity will increase if the foresight on future inflows becomes more limited, an opposite result is also possible to occur depending on the system's characteristics and hydrology. Moreover, knowing about future inflows does not help any more after a certain level of foresight horizon. These findings provide insight into the issue of uncertainty of future inflows and their forecasts in the design and operation of reservoir systems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} determining cost-minimal process designs for ideal multi-component distillation columns. The special case of binary distillation was considered in former work. Therein, a problem-specific bound-tightening strategy based on monotonic mole fraction profiles of single components was developed to solve the corresponding <b>MINLPs,</b> globally. In the multi-component setting, the mole fraction profiles of single components may not be monotonic, {{which is why the}} bound-tightening strategy from the binary case cannot be applied. In this follow-up paper, a model reformulation for ideal multi-component distillation columns is presented. The reformulation is achieved by suitable aggregations of the involved components. Proofs are given showing that mole fraction profiles of aggregated components are monotonic. This property is then used to adapt the bound-tightening strategy from the two-component case to the proposed model reformulation. Computational results are provided that indicate the usefulness of both the model reformulation and the adapted bound tightening technique for deterministic global optimization of ideal multi-component distillation column designs...|$|R
