Eastman Kodak's 1928 Kodacolor film was based on Keller-Dorian cinematography.

In the 1930s several US patents relating to lenticular techniques were granted, mostly for color film.|$|E

40|$|Gender {{stereotypes}} {{have been}} implicated in sex-typed perceptions of facial emotion. Such interpretations were recently called into question because facial cues of emotion are confounded with sexually dimorphic facial cues. Here we examine the role of visual cues and gender stereotypes in perceptions of biological <b>motion</b> <b>displays,</b> thus overcoming the morphological confounding inherent in facial displays. In four studies, participants' judgments revealed gender stereotyping. Observers accurately perceived emotion from biological <b>motion</b> <b>displays</b> (Study 1), and this affected sex categorizations. Angry displays were overwhelmingly judged to be men; sad displays were judged to be women (Studies 2 - 4). Moreover, this pattern remained strong when stimuli were equated for velocity (Study 3). We argue that these results were obtained because perceivers applied gender stereotypes of emotion to infer sex category (Study 4). Implications for both vision sciences and social psychology are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Group motion {{gives the}} perceiver the {{illusion}} {{that all of the}} discs within the display are moving simultaneously to the right and then back again. As with element motion this effect can be seen in Figure 3 as well as demonstrated in Figure 2. Braddick in 1980 posited that the occurrence of group motion at longer ISIs {{can be attributed to the}} short-range motion process signalling motion in the central elements of the <b>motion</b> <b>display,</b> which in turn leads to the long-range process to signal that the three elements are moving in unison.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} observe the Ternus illusion/effect, {{observers}} view an apparent <b>motion</b> <b>display</b> known as a Ternus display. The Ternus display features a series of frames that are separated by {{what is known as}} a blank interstimulus interval (ISI). A standard Ternus display consists of three frames, sequentially presented to the observer. As can be seen in Figure 3, Frame 1 consists of three equally spread out discs that are laid out in a horizontal fashion. Frame 2 is the blank ISI which separates Frame 1 and 3 for a variable duration. Frame 3, is simply the reverse of Frame 1 with the discs on the right hand side instead. This means that the disc on the outside of Frame 1 will now appear to be in the location that the centre disc was originally in as part of Frame 1.|$|E
40|$|The driven {{motion of}} {{vortices}} in the solid vortex state is analyzed with the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations. In large-scale numerical simulations, {{carried out on}} the IBM Scalable POWERparallel (SP) system at Argonne National Laboratory, many hundreds of vortices are followed as they move {{under the influence of}} a Lorentz force induced by a transport current {{in the presence of a}} planar defect (similar to a twin boundary in YBa{sub 2 }CU{sub 3 }O{sub 7 }). Correlations in the positions and velocities of the vortices in plastic and elastic motion are identified and compared. Two types of plastic motion are observed. Organized plastic <b>motion</b> <b>displaying</b> long-range orientational correlation and shorter-range velocity correlation occurs when the driving forces are small compared to the pinning forces in the twin boundary. Disorganized plastic <b>motion</b> <b>displaying</b> no significant correlation in either the velocities or orientation of the vortex system occurs when the driving and pinning forces axe of the same order...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{four-stroke}} apparent <b>motion</b> <b>displays,</b> pattern elements oscillate {{between two}} adjacent positions and synchronously reverse in contrast, but appear to move unidirectionally. For example, if rightward shifts preserve contrast but leftward shifts reverse contrast, consistent rightward motion is seen. In conventional first-order displays, elements reverse in luminance contrast (e. g. light elements become dark, and vice-versa). The resulting perception {{can be explained}} by responses in elementary motion detectors tuned to spatio–temporal orientation. Second-order <b>motion</b> <b>displays</b> contain texture-defined elements, and {{there is some evidence that}} they excite second-order motion detectors that extract spatio–temporal orientation following the application of a non-linear ‘texture-grabbing’ transform by the visual system. We generated a variety of second-order four-stroke displays, containing texture-contrast reversals instead of luminance contrast reversals, and used their effectiveness as a diagnostic test for the presence of various forms of non-linear transform in the second-order <b>motion</b> system. <b>Displays</b> containing only forward or only reversed phi motion sequences were also tested. Displays defined by variation in luminance, contrast, orientation, and size were effective. Displays defined by variation in motion, dynamism, and stereo were partially or wholly ineffective. Results obtained with contrast-reversing and four-stroke displays indicate that only relatively simple non-linear transforms (involving spatial filtering and rectification) are available during second-order energy-based motion analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{addresses}} {{the hypothesis that}} detection of biological motion is an intrinsic capacity of the visual system guided by a non-species-specific predisposition for the pattern of vertebrate movement and investigates the role of global vs. local information in biological motion detection. Two-day-old babies exposed to a biological motion point-light display (depicting a walking hen) and a non-biological <b>motion</b> <b>display</b> (a rotating rigid object) preferentially looked at the biological display (Experiment 1). A new group of newborns showed themselves {{to be capable of}} discriminating, following habituation, a biological <b>motion</b> <b>display</b> from a spatially scrambled version of it (Experiment 2). However, a third group of newborns, at their first exposure to such displays, did not show any preference between them (Experiment 3). Results confirm and extend previous comparative and developmental data, supporting an inborn predisposition to attend to biological motion in humans. This ability is presumably part of an evolutionarily ancient and non-species-specific system predisposing animals to preferentially attend to other animals...|$|E

40|$|Body motion signals {{socially}} relevant traits {{like the}} sex, age {{and even the}} genetic quality of actors, and may therefore facilitate various social judgements. By examining ratings and voting decisions based solely on body motion of political candidates, we considered how the candidates’ motion affected people’s judgements and voting behaviour. In two experiments, participants viewed stick figure <b>motion</b> <b>displays</b> made from videos of politicians in public debate. Participants rated the <b>motion</b> <b>displays</b> {{for a variety of}} social traits, and then indicated their vote preference. In both experiments, perceived physical health was the single best predictor of vote choice, and no two-factor model produced significant improvement. Notably, although attractiveness correlated with voting behaviour, it provided no additional explanatory power to a single-factor model of health alone. Our results demonstrate {{for the first time that}} motion can produce systematic vote preferences. 3 Body motion is a valid signal of socially relevant traits (see Blake & Shiffrar, 2007, for a review).

40|$|Motion {{perception}} {{is a fundamental}} feature of the human visual system. As part of our daily life we often have to determine the direction of motion, even in ambiguous situations. These situations force us to rely on exogenous cues, such as other environmental motion, endogenous cues, such as our own actions, or previously learned experiences. In three experiments, we asked participants to report the direction of an ambiguous <b>motion</b> <b>display,</b> manipulating exogenous and endogenous sources of information. Specifically, in all three experments the exogenous information was represented by another motion cue while the endogenous cue was represented respectively by movement execution, movement planning, or a learned association about the <b>motion</b> <b>display.</b> Participants were consistently biased by stable motion cues in the environment when reporting the ambiguous target direction. In the absence of stable exogenous motion information, participants were biased by their motor movements and even the planning of such movements. However, when participants learned a specific association about the target motion, this acquired endogenous knowledge countered exogenous motion cues in biasing participants’ perception. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that we disambiguate ambiguous motion using different sources of exogenous and endogenous cues, and that learned associations may be particularly salient in countering the biasing effects of environmental cues...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn object {{moving in}} {{discrete}} steps can appear to move continuously even along {{sections of the}} path in which no stimulus is presented. We investigated whether the internal representation of such an object is constructed by extrapolation, along the expected trajectory of the object, or by interpolation, after the subsequent reappearance of the object. Observers viewed two discs moving in an unambiguous apparent <b>motion</b> <b>display,</b> which either occasionally reversed direction or continued moving along the predicted path. Observers carried out a speeded 2 AFC task on probes presented between the possible disc locations. In the continuous condition, observers’ reaction times to detect and identify a probe were longer when it occurred ahead of the disc than when it occurred elsewhere on the motion path. Conversely, when the disc reversed direction, significantly less interference was observed ahead of the disc (along the predicted motion path), and significantly more interference was observed behind the disc (along the updated motion path). We conclude that the representation of a moving object in an apparent <b>motion</b> <b>display</b> is constructed by interpolation as well as extrapolation. We demonstrate that this representation is maintained and updated even outside the locus of focused attention, {{and that it is}} possible to dissociate the contributions of interpolation and extrapolation mechanisms to an object’s representation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{contrast}} to the short-duration and quick reversibility of attention, a long-term sensitization to color based on protracted attention in a visual search task was reported by Tseng, Gobell, and Sperling (2004). When subjects were trained {{for a few hours}} to search for a red object among colored distracters, sensitivity to red was increased for weeks. This sensitization was quantified using ambiguous motion displays containing isoluminant red–green and texture-contrast gratings, in which the perceived motion-direction depended both on the attended color and on the relative red–green saturation. Such long-term effects could result from either sensitization of the attended color, or suppression of unattended colors, or a combination of the two. Here we unconfound these effects by eliminating one of the paired colors of the <b>motion</b> <b>display</b> from the search task. The other paired color in the <b>motion</b> <b>display</b> can then be either a target or a distracter in the search task. Thereby, we separately measure the effect of attention on sensitizing the target color or suppressing distracter colors. The results indicate that only sensitization of the target color in the search task is statistically significant for the present experimental conditions. We conclude that selective attention to a color in our visual search task caused long-term sensitization to the attended color but not significant long-term suppression of the unattended color...|$|E

40|$|A {{new type}} of motion-induced illusory figure {{determined}} by local kinematic information is investigated. The new figure is induced by radial line patterns subjected to either figure motion (the lines change {{as if they were}} stationary and a triangle was rotating in front of them) or background motion (the lines change as if they were being rotated behind a stationary triangle). Although the two kinds of motion are equivalent from the viewpoint of relative displacements, perceptually they yield very different results. With background motion, observers tend to perceive rigid figures that have a triangular shape. With figure motion, observers report seeing deforming figures with shapes that vary depending on the number of lines in the display. We consider two alternative accounts for this asymmetry which we term the background superiority effect (BSE). The first account proposes that the effect is due to retinal persistence and to figure stability. Against this line of explanation, we demonstrate that observers also see rigid triangular shapes in displays where both the figure and the radial lines rotate (double <b>motion</b> <b>displays).</b> The second account proposes that the effect depends on the availability of local kinematic information constraining contour orientation. This second line of explanation is consistent with observers' reports of bowed edges in double <b>motion</b> <b>displays</b> rotating in phase or in counterphase. Candidate mechanisms for extracting local kinematic information are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Four-stroke {{apparent}} <b>motion</b> <b>displays</b> contain luminance edges that alternate {{in position}} and synchronously reverse in contrast polarity. As a result {{they appear to}} move unidirectionally, a percept that is readily accommodated by current models of motion energy analysis. Second-order <b>motion</b> <b>displays</b> contain texture-defined edges, {{and there is some}} evidence that they excite second-order energy detectors that are fed by 'texture-grabbing' transforms. However, different second-order textures require different transforms, and it is not clear how many transforms are available to second-order energy analysis. We used the effectiveness of second-order four-stroke apparent motion as a diagnostic test for the availability of various tranforms to motion energy analysis. Methods: Seven four-stroke displays were created, containing contours defined by modulation of - luminance; contrast; flicker; disparity; size; motion parallax; and orientation. In each case we measured the effectiveness of both the whole cycle, and of fractions of a cycle, at generating unidirectional apparent motion. Results: All except three of the displays proved effective in both part- and whole- cycle presentations. The three failures involved flicker modulation, disparity modulation, and motion parallax. Conclusions: The successful displays contained contours that can be revealed by transformations incorporating spatial filtering and rectification; the unsuccessful displays all require more complex transformations (spatiotemporal filtering or binocular analysis). The former transformations thus appear to feed into second-order energy analysis, but the latter transformations do not...|$|R
