40|$|Historians, {{literary}} scholars, {{and international}} lawyers {{interested in the}} early modern period have all grappled {{with the problem of}} anachronism, yet mostly independently of one another. This essay uses the question of war crime in Shakespeare’s Henry V to argue that early modernists interested in international law need not reject synchronic historicism for explicitly anachronistic or presentist approaches. Proposing as a new context for Shakespeare’s play a little-known humanist disputation by the civil lawyer Alberico <b>Gentili,</b> <b>De</b> amis Romanis (1599), it illuminates a juridical approach to the international past cultivated in the early modern period alongside the rise of international law—an approach closely linked with literary epistemologies...|$|R

Some denounce the question as anachronistic, arguing that contemporary legal terminology can’t be applied to historical events or figures like those depicted in the play. However, other scholars have pushed back on this view. For instance, Christopher N. Warren looks to Alberico <b>Gentili’s</b> <b>De</b> armis Romanis, along with Henry V itself, to show how early modern thinkers (including Shakespeare) were themselves using juridical approaches to engage with the past. As a result, Warren argues, the question of whether Henry V was a war criminal is not only legitimate, but also “historically appropriate.” ...|$|R

40|$|Cultural {{transfers}} between eighteenth-century France and Britain {{did much}} to shape the intellectual identity of each nation. But what were the main channels of communication? How did they function? What was their impact? In Cultural transfers: France and Britain in the long eighteenth century a team of specialists focuses on the networks and correspondences on which these exchanges were based, the concrete form they took and the material, political or ideological constraints which governed them. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the roles of: â¢ intermediaries such as diplomats, scientific institutions, or the Huguenot exiles who played a crucial part in disseminating English scientific, theological and political writings â¢ gazettes, learned periodicals, and government-sponsored journals where the French learned about British political debates and institutions â¢ translators, who could significantly alter texts in line with their own preconceptions and agendas or the expectations of their readers This multidisciplinary book moves beyond the classic concern with âinfluencesâ of one author or culture on another. It presents a new understanding of the hidden international networks that sustained the Republic of Letters and of the synthesis that emerged through contacts and interaction between French and British culture.

CASSection: Surface Chemistry and Colloids Abstract Abstract Image Ordered self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of thiolated diarylethene photochromic molecules have been built on a Au(111) surface and characterized by mean of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) for the first time. It has been revealed that molecules deposited from UV-illuminated (closed-ring isomer) and initial solutions (open-ring isomer) both occupy 4 × 2 √ 3 adsorption sites on Au(111) and present a conformation where conjugated parts are parallel to the surface, forming "umbrella-like" structure. On {{the basis of the}} distances measured from STM images with intramolecular resolution and on quantum chemical DFT calculations of electronic structure for single molecules, an identical model of molecular packing with a 4 × 4 √ 3 unit cell is proposed for both isomers. The variation of internal orbitals between open- and closed-ring isomers leads to significant change of STM contrast, allowing direct identification of each diarylethene isomer using STM images...|$|R
40|$|Abstract] After {{long-term}} rises, {{over the}} last decade age-standardised mortality from most common cancer sites has fallen in the European Union (EU). For males, the fall was 11 % for lung and intestines, 12 % for bladder, 6 % for oral cavity and pharynx, and 5 % for oesophagus. For females, the fall was 7 % for breast and 21 % for intestines. There were also persisting declines in stomach cancer (30 % in both sexes), uterus (mainly cervix, - 26 %) and leukaemias (- 10 %). Mortality rates for other common neoplasms, including pancreas for both sexes, prostate and ovary, tended to stabilise. The only unfavourable trends were observed for female lung cancer (+ 15 %). Lung cancer rates in women from the EU are approximately one-third of those in the USA, and 50 % lower than breast cancer rates in the EU. Lung cancer rates in European women have also tended to stabilise below the age of 75 years. Thus, effective interventions on tobacco control could, in principle, avoid a major lung cancer epidemic in European women.

Cochat, P. info:eu-repo/semantics/article article 2008 Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation 2351636 - 1641 <![CDATA[BACKGROUND: Type 1 pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA 1) is a salt-wasting syndrome caused by mineralocorticoid resistance. Autosomal recessive and dominant hereditary forms are caused by Epithelial Na Channel and Mineralocorticoid Receptor mutation respectively, while secondary PHA 1 is usually associated with urological problems. METHODS: Ten patients were studied in four French pediatric units in order to characterize PHA 1 spectrum in infants. Patients were selected by chart review. Genetic, clinical and biochemistry data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Autosomal recessive PHA 1 (n = 3) was diagnosed at 6 and 7 days of life in three patients presenting with severe hyperkalaemia and weight loss. After 8 months, 3 and 5 years on follow-up, neurological development and longitudinal growth was normal with high sodium supplementation. Autosomal dominant PHA 1 (n = 4) was revealed at 15, 19, 22 and 30 days of life because of failure to thrive. At 8 months, 3 and 21 years of age, longitudinal growth was normal in three patients who were given salt supplementation; no significant catch-up growth was obtained in the last patient at 20 months of age. Secondary PHA 1 (n = 3) was diagnosed at 11, 26 days and 5 months of life concomitantly with acute pyelonephritis in three children with either renal hypoplasia, urinary duplication or bilateral megaureter. The outcome was favourable and salt supplementation was discontinued after 3, 11 and 13 months. CONCLUSIONS: PHA 1 should be suspected in case of severe hyperkalemia and weight loss in infants and need careful management. Pathogenesis of secondary PHA 1 is still challenging and further studies are mandatory to highlight the link between infection, developing urinary tract and pseudohypoaldosteronism...|$|R
