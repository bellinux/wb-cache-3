5|$|The naturalism {{of natural}} {{selection}} conflicted with presumptions of purpose in nature and while this could be reconciled by theistic evolution, other mechanisms implying <b>more</b> <b>progress</b> or purpose were more acceptable. Herbert Spencer had already incorporated Lamarckism into his popular philosophy of progressive free market human society. He popularised the terms evolution and survival of the fittest, and many thought Spencer was central to evolutionary thinking.|$|E

25|$|In the meantime, Polish–Lithuanian {{relations}} worsened as Polish politicians {{found it}} hard to accept Lithuanians demand for a complete independence and their territorial demands, especially on ceding the city of Vilnius, Lithuanian historical capital which had nonetheless a Polish ethnic majority. Thus Lithuanian nationalist leaned more and more towards the Soviet side. Polish negotiators made some <b>more</b> <b>progress</b> in negotiations with Latvian Provisional Government, and in early 1920 Polish and Latvian forces were conducting some joint operations against Soviets.|$|E
25|$|The Foster and Ruthenberg factions {{likewise}} blamed {{each other}} for the defeat of the 1926 strike of textile workers in Passaic, New Jersey, in which the Ruthenberg leadership supported an overt Party role in the strike and what amounted to creation of a dual union.

25|$|Ahmad Dallal notes that, {{unlike the}} Babylonians, Greeks, and Indians, who had {{developed}} elaborate systems of mathematical astronomical study, the pre-Islamic Arabs relied entirely on empirical observations. These observations {{were based on}} the rising and setting of particular stars, and this area of astronomical study was known as anwa. Anwa continued to be developed after Islamization by the Arabs, where Islamic astronomers added mathematical methods to their empirical observations. According to David King, after the rise of Islam, the religious obligation to determine the qibla and prayer times inspired <b>more</b> <b>progress</b> in astronomy for centuries.|$|E

25|$|According to Chen and Ravallion, about 1.76 {{billion people}} in {{developing}} world lived above $1.25 {{per day and}} 1.9 billion people lived below $1.25 per day in 1981. The world's population increased over the next 25 years. In 2005, about 4.09 billion people in developing world lived above $1.25 per day and 1.4 billion people lived below $1.25 per day (both 1981 and 2005 data are on inflation adjusted basis). Some scholars caution that these trends are subject to various assumptions and not certain. Additionally, they note that the poverty reduction is not uniform across the world; economically prospering countries such as China, India and Brazil have made <b>more</b> <b>progress</b> in absolute poverty reduction than countries in {{other regions of the}} world.|$|E
25|$|Ranieri's {{second season}} saw some <b>more</b> <b>progress,</b> {{mainly in the}} cups, with Chelsea {{reaching}} the League Cup semi-finals and another FA Cup final, {{but was unable to}} prevent them from losing to double winners Arsenal in the latter. League form saw little improvement, though, and Chelsea again finished sixth. With rumours of the club's perilous financial state circulating, Ranieri was unable to sign any more players. As a result, expectations of Chelsea in the 2002–03 season were more limited. Chelsea nevertheless made an unexpected title challenge and, in {{perhaps one of the most}} significant matches in the club's history, defeated Liverpool 2–1 in the final game of the season to finish fourth and secure the final Champions League berth ahead of the Merseysiders.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{in this review}} increasing evidence that loss of LKB 1 kinase in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) derails the existing natural balance between cell survival and tumour growth suppression. LKB 1 deletion can plunge cells into an energy/oxidative stress-induced crisis {{which leads to the}} activation of alternative and often carcinogenic pathways to maintain cellular energy levels. It therefore appears that although LKB 1 deficiency can suppress oncogenic transformation in the short term, it can ultimately lead to <b>more</b> <b>progressed</b> and malignant phenotypes by driving abnormal cell differentiation, genomic instability and increased tumour heterogeneity...|$|R
25|$|Employment {{trends in}} Bogotá {{indicate}} that rates of unemployment have fallen while {{a growing number}} of citizens are looking for work. This paradox can largely be explained by ongoing urbanization into Bogotá, therefore poverty remains a substantial problem. Jobs have been created in some sectors, and women are gaining more opportunities for employment, but <b>more</b> <b>progress</b> is needed. Overall, poverty since 1970 has decreased; however, data collected and presented in 2006 by UN-HABITAT at the World Urban Forum in Vancouver, Canada reveal that 50% of the population still live in poverty and many of those live in slums. A separate UN-HABITAT report from 2003 describes three types of slums in Bogotá: inner-city, those lying on the perimeter, and squatter settlements. The total number of those living under these conditions is around 700,000. Additional data by UN-HABITAT shows that wealth is very unevenly distributed and that pockets of poverty exist in Bogotá that are poorer than the poorest regions of the country as a whole.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Although Huntington disease (HD) {{is caused}} by an {{autosomal}} dominant mutation, its phenotypic presentation differs widely. Variability in clinical phenotypes of HD may reflect the existence of disease subtypes. This hypothesis was tested in prodromal participants from the longitudinal Neurobiological Predictors of Huntington Disease (PREDICT-HD) study. Method: We performed clustering using longitudinal data assessing motor, cognitive, and depression symptoms. Using data from 521 participants with 2, 716 data points, we fit growth mixture models (GMM) that identify groups based on multivariate trajectories. Results: In various GMM, different phases of disease progression were partitioned by progression trajectories of motor and cognitive signs, and by overall level of depression symptoms. <b>More</b> <b>progressed</b> motor signs were accompanied by <b>more</b> <b>progressed</b> cognitive signs, but not always by higher levels of depressive symptoms. In several models, {{there were at least}} 2 groups with similar trajectories for motor and cognitive signs that showed different levels for depression symptoms- one with a very low level of depression and the other with a higher level of depression. Conclusions: Findings indicate that at least intermediate HD progression might be associated with different levels of depression. Depression {{is one of the few}} symptoms that is treatable in HD and has implications for clinical care. Identification of potential depression subtypes may also help to select appropriate patients for clinical trials...|$|R

Just before Hughes departed, Dupont released {{a statement saying that}} Reedman would take office in Lisbon on 1 August, and would be [...] "warmly welcomed" [...] by the Portuguese government. Hughes decried this in a brief telephone call to Smith, but could do little more before leaving Rhodesia that evening. On 29 July, Smith fielded questions from the press, commenting on both Lisbon and the independence talks in general. He expressed the belief that Rhodesia had made <b>more</b> <b>progress</b> towards independence talking with Hughes than it ever had before, but qualified this by saying only Wilson's reply to the proposals given to Hughes would show if this were indeed true. He said that although he thought Whitehall was keen to resolve the independence issue, he did not believe their line had changed. He declared that he and the RF would not change their stance in any way. Moving to the subject of Lisbon, Smith stressed that this was separate from the independence dispute, then overruled Dupont's announcement of two days before: Reedman's appointment would remain provisional until further notice, he said.|$|E
