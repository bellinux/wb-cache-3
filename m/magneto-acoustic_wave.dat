25|$|The wave heating theory, {{proposed}} in 1949 by Evry Schatzman, proposes that waves carry {{energy from the}} solar interior to the solar chromosphere and corona. The Sun is made of plasma rather than ordinary gas, so it supports several types of waves analogous to sound waves in air. The most important types of <b>wave</b> are <b>magneto-acoustic</b> <b>waves</b> and Alfvén <b>waves.</b> <b>Magneto-acoustic</b> <b>waves</b> are sound waves that have been modified {{by the presence of}} a magnetic field, and Alfvén waves are similar to ultra low frequency radio waves that have been modified by interaction with matter in the plasma.

40|$|Recent {{high-resolution}} {{observations of}} sunspot oscillations using simultaneously operated ground- and space-based telescopes reveal the intrinsic connection between different {{layers of the}} solar atmosphere. However, {{it is not clear}} whether these oscillations are externally driven or generated in-situ. We address this question by using observations of propagating slow <b>magneto-acoustic</b> <b>waves</b> along a coronal fan loop system. In addition to the generally observed decreases in oscillation amplitudes with distance, the observed wave amplitudes are also found to be modulated with time, with similar variations observed throughout the propagation path of the wavetrain. Employing multi-wavelength and multi-instrument data we study the amplitude variations with time as the waves propagate through different layers of the solar atmosphere. By comparing the amplitude-modulation period in different layers, we find that slow <b>magneto-acoustic</b> <b>waves</b> observed in sunspots are externally driven by photospheric p-modes, which propagate upwards into the corona before becoming dissipated.

40|$|We present {{two-dimensional}} {{simulations of}} wave propagation in a realistic, non-stationary {{model of the}} solar atmosphere. This model shows a granular velocity field and magnetic flux concentrations in the intergranular lanes similar to observed velocity and magnetic structures on the Sun and takes radiative transfer into account. We present three cases of <b>magneto-acoustic</b> <b>wave</b> propagation through the model atmosphere, where {{we focus on the}} interaction of different <b>magneto-acoustic</b> <b>wave</b> at the layer of similar sound and Alfvén speeds, which we call the equipartition layer. At this layer the acoustic and magnetic mode can exchange energy depending on the angle between the wave vector and the magnetic field vector. Our results show that above the equipartition layer and in all three cases the fast magnetic mode is refracted back into the solar atmosphere. Thus, the magnetic wave shows an evanescent behavior in the chromosphere. The acoustic mode, which travels along the magnetic field in the low plasma-β regime, can be a direct consequence of an acoustic source within or outside the low-β regime, or it can result from conversion of the magnetic mode, possibly from several such conversions when the wave travels across a series of equipartition layers.

Our aim is to model and analyze the response of such a magnetic structure to vertical and horizontal periodic motions originating in the photosphere. To carry out the simulations, we employed our MHD code SAC (Sheffield Advanced Code). A combination of the VALIIIC and McWhirter solar atmospheres and coronal density profiles were used as the background equilibrium model in the simulations. Vertical and horizontal harmonic sources, located at the footpoint region of the open magnetic flux tube, are incorporated in the calculations, to excite oscillations {{in the domain of}} interest. To perform the analysis we have constructed a series of time–distance diagrams of the vertical and perpendicular components of the velocity with respect to the magnetic field lines at each height of the computational domain. These time–distance diagrams are subject to spatio-temporal Fourier transforms allowing us to build ω–k dispersion diagrams for all of the simulated regions in the solar atmosphere. This approach makes it possible to compute the phase speeds of waves propagating throughout the various regions of the solar atmosphere model.

In our experiment, a fast magnetoacoustic wave {{of a given}} frequency and wavenumber is generated below the surface. The magnetic field in the domain is assumed homogeneous and inclined. The efficiency of the conversion to Alfven waves near the layer of equal acoustic and Alfven speeds is measured calculating their energy flux. The particular amplitude and phase relations between the oscillations of magnetic field and velocity help us {{to demonstrate that the}} waves produced after the transformation and reaching upper atmosphere are indeed Alfven waves.

40|$|Slow <b>magneto-acoustic</b> <b>waves</b> {{are often}} {{observed}} in polar plumes and active region fan loops. The observed periodicities of these waves {{are in the}} range of 1 - 40 minutes. Mainly, the ratio of damping time to the oscillation period is less than 2 (equal to the ratio damping length to the wave length), which corresponds to the strong damping regime. In general, slow <b>magneto-acoustic</b> <b>waves</b> can be damped with different dissipation mechanisms. Previously, the effect of thermal conduction like compressive viscosity, optical thin radiation, density stratification, and non-uniform magnetic field on the damping of slow magneto acoustic wave was investigated. Theoretical studies indicate that the observed damping length of slow waves must be depended to the frequency of oscillation. In this paper, damping length and frequency-dependent damping length in propagating slow <b>magneto-acoustic</b> <b>waves</b> has been studied by AIA/SDO images in the 171 and 193 A 0. The results of this analysis indicate that the frequencies range of intensity oscillation is 0. 5 to 16. 7 mHz (1 to 33 minutes), and power spectral densities of intensity oscillation are dominated for 1, 2. 2 3. 6 and 4. 6 mHz. The average damping length of intensity oscillation was obtained 38. 1, 35. 4, 32. 7 and 29. 5 Mm for 1, 2. 2, 3. 6 and 4. 6 mHz oscillation respectively. Also, the damping length of 2. 2, 3. 6 and 4. 6 mHz oscillation was decreased about 7 %, 13. 5 % and 22. 2 % compared to the damping length of 1 mHz. The order of magnitude of the damping lengths that obtained from this analysis are in agreement with previous findings by the authors and the result of the theoretical dispersion of relations of MHD waves, but the frequency-dependent damping length is much less than the theoretical prediction...|$|R
40|$|We {{focus on}} a polar coronal hole region to find any {{evidence}} of dissipation of propagating slow <b>magneto-acoustic</b> <b>waves.</b> We obtained time-distance and frequency-distance maps along the plume structure in a polar coronal hole. We also obtained Fourier power maps of the polar coronal hole in different frequency ranges in 171 Å and 193 Å passbands. We performed intensity distribution statistics in time domain at several locations in the polar coronal hole. We find the presence of propagating slow <b>magneto-acoustic</b> <b>waves</b> having temperature dependent propagation speeds. The wavelet analysis and Fourier power maps of the polar coronal hole show that low-frequency waves are travelling longer distances (longer detection length) as compared to high-frequency waves. We found two distinct dissipation length scales of wave amplitude decay at two different height ranges (between 0 [...] 10 Mm and 10 [...] 70 Mm) along the observed plume structure. The dissipation lengths obtained at higher height range show some frequency dependence. Individual Fourier power spectrum at several locations show a power-law distribution with frequency whereas probability density function (PDF) of intensity fluctuations in time show nearly Gaussian distributions. Propagating slow <b>magneto-acoustic</b> <b>waves</b> are getting heavily damped (small dissipation lengths) within the first 10 Mm distance. Beyond that waves are getting damped slowly with height. Frequency dependent dissipation lengths of wave propagation at higher heights may indicate the possibility of wave dissipation due to thermal conduction, however, the contribution from other dissipative parameters cannot be ruled out. Power-law distributed power spectra were also found at lower heights in the solar corona, which may provide viable information on the generation of longer period waves in the solar atmosphere.

40|$|We {{present in}} this paper both a linear study and {{numerical}} relativistic MHD simula-tions of the non-resonant streaming instability occurring in the precursor of relativistic shocks.

This considers <b>magneto-acoustic</b> <b>waves</b> having a wave vector perpendicular to the shock front and the large scale magnetic field. Our linear analysis is achieved without any assumption on the shock velocity and is thus valid for all velocity regimes. In order to check our cal-culation, we also perform relativistic MHD simulations describing the propagation of the aforementioned <b>magneto-acoustic</b> <b>waves</b> through the shock precursor.

We extend existing models of magnetoacoustic waveguides to consider the effects of an expanding magnetic field. The funnel geometry employed includes a field-aligned density structure.

The effects of the density contrast ratio, density stratification, and spectral profile of the driver upon the excited wave trains were investigated. Results: The density structure acts as a dispersive waveguide for fast <b>magneto-acoustic</b> <b>waves</b> and generates a quasi-periodic wave train similar to previous models. The funnel geometry leads to generating additional wave trains that propagate outside the density structure. These newly discovered wave trains are formed by the leakage of transverse perturbations, but they propagate upwards owing to the refraction caused by the magnetic funnel.

This sunspot was chosen because it is axisym-metric, shows little evolution during 20 – 28 January 2002, and was observed continuously by the MDI/SOHO instrument. AR 9787 is visible on helioseismic maps of the farside of the Sun from 15 January, i. e. days before it crossed the East limb. Oscillations have reduced amplitudes in the sunspot at all frequencies, whereas a region of enhanced acoustic power above 5. 5 mHz (above the quiet-Sun acoustic cutoff) is seen outside the sunspot and the plage region. This enhanced acoustic power has been suggested {{to be caused by}} the conversion of acoustic <b>waves</b> into <b>magneto-acoustic</b> <b>waves</b> that are refracted back into the interior and re-emerge as acoustic waves in the quiet Sun.

By applying the obtained criteria for effective wave coupling to the solar wind parameters, we show that velocity shear-induced linear transformations of Alfvén <b>waves</b> into <b>magneto-acoustic</b> <b>waves</b> could effectively take place for the relatively low-frequency Alfvén waves in the energy containing interval. The obtained results are in a good qualitative agreement with the observed features of density perturbations in the solar wind. Comment: Astrophysical Journal (accepted...|$|R
40|$|Weak {{turbulence}} of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) {{waves in}} strongly magnetized plasma is studied when the thermal pressure {{is less than}} the magnetic field pressure. In this situation the main nonlinear mechanism is the resonance scattering of fast <b>magneto-acoustic</b> and Alfvenic <b>waves</b> on slow <b>magneto-acoustic</b> <b>waves.</b> As a result, the former waves serve as the high-frequency waves with respect to the latter ones so that the total number of HF waves - an adiabatic invariant - conserves additionally. In the weak turbulence regime this invariant is shown to generate the Kolmogorov type spectrum with a constant flux of HF waves towards large-scale region. In the short-wave region another Kolmogorov spectrum can be realized with a constant energy flux. The explicit angle dependences for both types of turbulent spectra are found for the propagation angles close to the direction of a mean magnetic field. Comment: 16 pages, JETP (accepted...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} hydromagnetic-wave {{in the upper}} F 2 -region, in which {{electrons}} are in a transitional regime from collisional to collisionless conditions and ions are in a collisionless state, is examined. Derivation of the governing equations {{is based on the}} fact that the isotropic electrons are fluid-like, and the anisotropic ions follow kinetic equations modified by ion-electron collisions. <b>Magneto-acoustic</b> <b>waves</b> of a period of from about 0. 2 to 10 sec are dissipated by ion Landau damping and electron thermal conduction and viscosity. Numerical solutions under ionospheric conditions show that the dissipation of hydromagnetic waves is insufficient to modify the large scale heating of the ionosphere...|$|R
