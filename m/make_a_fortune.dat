Wheatstone, according to his own statement, remarked to Cooke that the method would not act, and produced his own experimental telegraph.

He is {{actually}} a Polish Jew whose real name is Jehoede Leip Jegiel Igel. He hid his true identity because the Dutch East India Company prohibited the Jews from travelling to its holdings, especially its new headquarters in Batavia.

When de Klerk unexpectedly returned, he was given 50 strokes for his laziness. On that same day, he swore that he would own the estate one day. After finishing his military service, Jehoeve changed his name to Leendert Miero and worked as a goldsmith.
