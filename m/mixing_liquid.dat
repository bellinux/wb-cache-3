50|$|Eventually, {{the skilled}} {{craftsman}} and researcher Adolf Wilhelm Keim succeeded in <b>mixing</b> <b>liquid</b> water glass and mineral color pigments {{to create a}} paint that could withstand the climate north of the Alps {{while at the same}} time offering brilliant colors. The paint's durability results from the chemical bond formed by the binding agent with the substrate (silification). Keim obtained a patent for his mineral paints in 1878, thus laying the foundation stone for today's company KEIMFARBEN GMBH. The first production site was near to the limestone quarry in Offenstetten (which belongs to Abensberg today) in Lower Bavaria.|$|E
5000|$|Dental amalgam is {{produced}} by <b>mixing</b> <b>liquid</b> mercury with an alloy made of silver, tin, and copper solid particles. [...] Small quantities of zinc, mercury and other metals may be present in some alloys. This combination of solid particles is known as amalgam alloy. The composition of the alloy particles are controlled by the ISO Standard (ISO 1559) for dental amalgam alloy {{in order to control}} properties of set amalgam such as corrosion and setting expansion. It is important to differentiate between dental amalgam and the amalgam alloy that is commercially produced and marketed as small filings, spheroid particles, or a combination of these, suitable for mixing with liquid mercury to produce the dental amalgam. Amalgam is used most commonly for direct, permanent, posterior restorations and for large foundation restorations, or cores, which are precursors to placing crowns.|$|E

5000|$|The {{successful}} {{mixing of}} powder {{is more difficult}} than <b>mixing</b> <b>liquid,</b> as perfect homogeneity is difficult to achieve. A further problem is the inherent cohesiveness and resistance to movement between the individual particles. The process is further complicated in many systems {{by the presence of}} substantial segregation influencing the powder mix. This arises from the difference in size, shape, and density of the component particles. The powder/granules blending are involved at stage of pre granulation and/or post granulation stage of tablet manufacturing. Each process of mixing has an optimum mixing time, and longer mixing may result in an undesired product. The optimum mixingtime and mixing speed must be evaluated. Blending prior to compression is normally achieved in a simple tumble blender. The blender may be a fixed blender into which the powders are charged, blended and discharged. It is now common to use a bin blender. In special cases of mixing a lubricant, over mixing should be particularly monitored. The various blenders used include [...] "V" [...] blender, Oblicone blender, Container blender, Tumbling blender, Agitated powder blender.But nowadays to optimize the manufacturing process particularly in wet granulation the variousimproved equipment which combines several processing steps (mixing, granulation and/or drying) are used.

The effect of salts, e. g. Na+, Co 3 +, Y 3 + and La 3 +, on the transition temperature range of the <b>mixed</b> <b>liquid</b> crystals was also investi-gated. The crown ether cholesteric liquid crystal B 15 C 5 -COOCh was applied both as a surfactant and an ion transport carrier to transport metal ions through liquid membranes.

The {{results showed that}} adding suspended carriers in MBR can increase the concentration of EPSS and EPSB in activated sludge <b>mixing</b> <b>liquid,</b> but the effect on EPSS and EPSB in the sludge on membrane model surface is related to aeration rate. Adding suspended carriers can increase the concentration of EPSS and EPSB in the sludge on membrane model surface at 0. 10 m 3 /h of aeration rate; the concentration of EPSS and EPSB in the sludge with suspended carriers is reduced when aeration rate is increased to 0. 25 m 3 /h. The study {{on the effect of}} aeration rate on EPS in sludge <b>mixing</b> <b>liquid</b> of MBR and in sludge on membrane model surface showed that an optimized aeration rate exists if suspended carriers are added to control MBR membrane fouling.

The {{effect of}} using Na 2 HPO 4 {{solution}} as <b>mixing</b> <b>liquid</b> in the physicochemical and mechanical properties of calcium aluminate cement (CAC), {{with a view}} to a possible reinforcement additive of conventional α-TCP-based CPC was studied. The results showed that the degree of the hydration reaction of CaAl 2 O 4 (CA) increased when Na 2 HPO 4 solution was used as <b>mixing</b> <b>liquid.</b> The porosity of cement was also lower (37. 9 ± 1. 3 %) than for H 2 O (33. 2 ± 3. 6 %). The values of compressive strength for cements prepared with both mixing liquids were lower than 3 MPa due to the excessive L/P ratio employed and large porosity. After immersion in SBF, only the Al(OH) 3 hydrate is observed and no other crystalline hydrated calcium aluminate nor calcium phosphate was formed in any of the cements. Both cements released Ca ions to, and removed P ions from SBF, being this effect more remarkable when Na 2 HPO 4 was used. As for other CAC, no Al was released to the SBF and no potential toxicity due to this ion should be expected...|$|E
