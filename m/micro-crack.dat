According to highly requirement from production field, a thermal stress-induced light scattering method (T-SILSM) was successfully developed for a non-contact inspection {{to detect the}} micro-cracks through changing in the intensity of light scattering accompanied by applying thermal stress at the responding position of the micro-cracks. In this study, in order to investigate that {{the origin of the}} measuring principle in microscopic order, a newly developed microscopic T-SILSM system with a rotation stage and a numerical simulation analysis were used to investigate the following; (1) the scattering points and surface in the <b>micro-crack,</b> (2) the stress concentration points in the <b>micro-crack,</b> and (3) the relationship between these information and the point in which intensity of the light scattering changes in the <b>micro-crack</b> through T-SILSM.

In addition, the position of the changes in the light scattering in was at both tips in the <b>micro-crack,</b> and it was consistent with the stress concentration point in the <b>micro-crack.</b> Therefore, it can be concluded that the intentional change in light scattering though T-SILSM is originated from light scattering at <b>micro-crack</b> and also from stress concentration and consecutive change in refractive index at both tips in <b>micro-crack...</b>|$|E

30|$|During the {{triaxial}} compression tests, {{the failure}} mechanism of shale {{can be explained}} using the sliding crack model of brittle heterogeneous material (Ashby et al. 1990; Li et al. 2015). Figure  9 shows the initial pre-existing <b>micro-cracks</b> distribution and the sliding crack model of shale samples under triaxial compression. As shown in Fig.  9 a, it can be assumed {{that there are a}} large number of natural <b>micro-cracks</b> and secondary thermal <b>micro-cracks</b> after LN 2 cooling inside shale samples; these <b>micro-cracks</b> can be regarded as the pre-existing <b>micro-cracks</b> (see Fig.  9 b). When the shear stress in the pre-existing <b>micro-cracks</b> exceeds the frictional force between crack interfaces, the wing cracks will be created from the tips of the pre-existing <b>micro-cracks.</b> Subsequently, a large number of <b>micro-cracks</b> inside the shale began to expand and connect, and the connection and growth of <b>micro-cracks</b> will lead to a large area of local failure. If the shale samples contain more pre-existing <b>micro-cracks,</b> these cracks will more easily connect, grow and interpenetrate. As observed in Figs.  6, 7, 8, the ultimate stress levels of all LN 2 -treated specimens are significantly lower than those of original and untreated ones, indicating that all LN 2 -treated specimens contain more the pre-existing <b>micro-cracks</b> than those of the original and untreated samples, resulting in the decrease in its effective bearing area and bearing capacity.|$|R

30|$|When LN 2 is {{in contact}} with dried shale, the {{interior}} of the shale will undergo greater thermal deformation, which results in the uncoordinated deformation between mineral particles due to the heterogeneity of shale micro-structure. During LN 2 cooling, the stress concentration will occur at the tip of natural <b>micro-cracks.</b> When the tensile stress inside the shale exceeds the cementation strength of mineral particles, and the shale will produce a large number of micro-tensile cracks. The nucleation and growth of these <b>micro-cracks</b> will further aggravate the damage of the shale during LN 2 cooling. As can be seen in Fig.  15, the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images show the propagation of <b>micro-cracks</b> of dried shale during LN 2 cooling.

In the examined configuration, we assumed that <b>micro-crack</b> transmission occurs due to surface relief growth in the secondary grain ahead of the primary crack.

Conversely, large grain- 1 /grain- 2 disorientation induces plastic strain spreading similar to crack tip blunting yielding slower indirect transmission.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the delamination of coating with <b>micro-cracks</b> under compressive residual stress coupled with diffusion induced stress. <b>Micro-cracks</b> in coating provide a passage for corrosive species towards the coating-substrate interface {{which in turn}} produces diffusion induced stress in the coating. <b>Micro-cracks</b> contract gradually with increasing compressive residual stress in coating due to thermal expansion mismatch which blocks the species diffusion towards the interface. This behaviour reduces the diffusion induced stress in the coating while the compressive residual stress increases. With further increase in compressive residual stress, <b>micro-cracks</b> reach to the point, where they cannot be constricted any further and a high compressive residual stress causes the coating to buckle away from the substrate resulting in delamination and therefore initiating blistering. Blistering causes the contracted <b>micro-cracks</b> to wide open again which increases diffusion induced stress along with high compressive residual stress. The high resultant stress in coating causes the blister to propagate in an axis-symmetric circular pattern. A two-part theoretical approach has been utilised coupling the thermodynamic concepts with the mechanics concepts. The thermodynamic concepts involve the corrosive species transportation through <b>micro-cracks</b> under increasing compression, eventually causing blistering, while the fracture mechanics concepts are used to treat the blister growth as circular defect propagation. The influences of moduli ratio, thickness ratio, thermal mismatch ratio, poisson’s ratio and interface roughness on blister growth are discussed. Experiment is reported for blistering to allow visualisation of interface and to permit coupled (diffusion and residual) stresses in the coating over {{a full range of}} interest.

In this study, an image processing scheme composed of segmentation procedures based on anisotropic diffusion and shape classification is presented. The results show that the segmentation procedures can detect and identify <b>micro-crack</b> pixels efficiently in the presence of various forms of noise.

30|$|In practice, {{there are}} various shapes and sizes of micro-cracks in a solar cell {{depending}} on how they are formed.
