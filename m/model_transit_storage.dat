40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{genetic algorithms}} for inducing high-level knowledge from available domain data, succeeding to obtain generalized solutions for a short-stage multi-channel queuing model. The domain of application, {{refers to the}} transportation problem of <b>transit</b> <b>storage</b> and re-load in seaports. Specifically, when a ship approaches the port, can be served {{by more than one}} service channel, in other words the seaport represents a queuing system. The seaport system forwards ships and lorries into the port, moves vehicles and cranes between two positions i. e. warehouses and berths, and finally loads and unloads cargoes from ships and lorries. Between the two load/unload processes taking place in both, ships and lorries, the <b>transit</b> <b>storage</b> process is embedded, thus forming in fact a three stage multi-channel queuing system. The standard process of working with such a queuing problem supposes Poisson distribution in all the service stages, definition of the service and waiting costs and the construction of an objective function for finding the best-cost solution. The solution produced above is generalized by applying a genetic algorithm approach for finding the best seaport configuration (i. e. optimal number of cranes, warehouses and lorries needed) among a possible set of them, which will offer the minimum seaport operating cost. The paper demonstrates that, when a set of possible configurations is effectively coded into a genetic population, the best solution might be achieved in a reasonably short time and well approximated. Keywords: queueing systems, genetic algorithms, computational intelligence, seaport operating cost optimization, transportation problems. 1...|$|R

These two options require different approaches to transit path-building, mode choice, and <b>transit</b> assignment. <b>Modeling</b> decisions regarding <b>transit</b> path-building techniques {{and the amount of}} transit path-choice incorporated into mode choice models directly impact the ability of travel models to consistently model mode choice and transit use.

The paper provides several suggestions regarding the interface transit path-choice and transit path-building {{based on the results of}} the empirical transit path-building tests. Two primary suggestions applicable to current planning processes have been made. First, transit path-choice should be performed in only one component of the forecasting process such as transit path-building or mode choice in order to minimize inconsistencies in the modeling process. Second, disaggregate measures such as prediction success tables comparing modeled boardings to reported boardings for individual observations of transit trips should be compiled for validation of transit networks and transit path-building procedures...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we compare {{outcomes}} of some extended phantom-like cosmologies {{with each other}} and also with ΛCDM and ΛDGP. We focus on the variation of the luminosity distances, {{the age of the universe}} and the deceleration parameter versus the redshift in these scenarios. In a dynamical system approach, we show that the accelerating phase of the universe in the f(R) -DGP scenario is stable if one consider the curvature fluid as a phantom scalar field in the equivalent scalar-tensor theory, otherwise it is a transient and unstable phenomenon. Up to the parameters values adopted in this paper, the extended F(R,ϕ) -DGP scenario is closer to the ΛCDM scenario than other proposed models. All of these scenarios explain the late-time cosmic speed-up in their normal DGP branches, but the redshift at which transition to the accelerating phase occurs are different: while the ΛDGP <b>model</b> <b>transits</b> to the accelerating phase much earlier, the F(R,ϕ) -DGP <b>model</b> <b>transits</b> to this phase much later than other scenarios. Also, within the parameter spaces adopted in this paper, the age of the universe in the f(R) -DGP model is larger than ΛCDM, but this age in F(G,ϕ) -DGP is smaller than ΛCDM.

40|$|At present, {{customized}} subarea {{models have}} been widely used in local transportation planning throughout the United States. The biggest strengths of a subarea model lie in its more detailed and accurate modeling outputs which better meet local planning requirements. In addition, a subarea model can substantially reduce database size and model running time. In spite of these advantages, subarea models remain quite weak in maintaining consistency with a regional <b>model,</b> <b>modeling</b> <b>transit</b> projects, smart growth measures, air quality conformity, and other areas. Both opportunities and threats exist for subarea modeling. In addition to examining subarea models, this paper introduces the decision-making process in choosing a proper subarea modeling approach (windowing versus focusing) and software package.

The Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual (TCQSM) travel time level of service (LOS) measure for transit {{was applied to the}}se GPS automobile and <b>modeled</b> <b>transit</b> data. To quantify system-level transit availability, the TCQSM service coverage LOS was applied to the Atlanta region and Atlanta s transit service area LOS was calculated as C. Most of the commuters in this study would experience transit-auto travel time LOS of F. The analyses revealed that revealed automobile travel times were 45 % shorter than the model-reported automobile travel time skims for the same origin and destination zones. Transit traces, calculated by manually tracing the trips from origin to destination via the most preferable transit mode, were about 24 % longer than the minimum travel-demand-modeled transit skims. Only about 9 % of commuters drove directly to work more than 95 % of the time and only 6 % of commuters left home within five minutes of their median departure time more than 95 % of the time, indicating that the convenience and flexibility of the automobile {{is likely to be a}} significant element in these commute mode decisions. Commuters perceive the total transit trip time as between being 1. 25 and 2. 5 as long as the actual (modeled) time, and only about 25 % of commuters could take transit without having to transfer.
