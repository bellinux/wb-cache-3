50|$|An {{important}} early {{land plant}} fossil locality is the Rhynie Chert, found {{outside the village}} of Rhynie in Scotland. The Rhynie chert is an Early Devonian sinter (hot spring) deposit composed primarily of silica. It is exceptional due to its preservation of several different clades of plants, from mosses and lycopods to <b>more</b> unusual, <b>problematic</b> forms. Many fossil animals, including arthropods and arachnids, are {{also found in the}} Rhynie Chert, and it offers a unique window on the history of early terrestrial life.|$|R
5|$|<b>More</b> <b>problematic</b> for {{non-commercial}} {{plants is}} the fungus, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. narcissi, which causes basal rot (rotting of the bulbs and yellowing of the leaves).

Since the fungus can remain in the soil for many years it is necessary to remove infected plants immediately, and to avoid planting further narcissi at that spot for a further five years. Not all species and cultivars are equally susceptible. Relatively resistant forms include N. triandrus, N. tazetta and N. jonquilla.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} {{buoyancy}} of a diving cylinder during the dive can be <b>more</b> <b>problematic</b> with side-mounted cylinders, {{and the actual}} buoyancy at any point during the dive is a consideration with any cylinder that may {{be separated from the}} diver for any reason. Cylinders which will be stage-dropped or handed off to another diver should not change the diver's buoyancy beyond what can be compensated using their buoyancy compensator. Cylinders with approximately neutral buoyancy when full generally require the least compensation when detached.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the rapid}} pace of operations, deployment, and redeployment, {{coordination}} of artillery units and their fires became a worrisome quandary during the operations.

The joint nature of the operation added another level of complexity to the already overstretched communications network. Regardless, due to the ability of U.S. logisticians to innovate and improvise, supplies of food, water, ammunition, and spare parts arrived at their destinations without any shortages hampering combat operations and the communications system, although complicated, functioned well enough during the short duration of U.S. operations.|$|E

Owls were identified by 50 % of respondents as being associated with taboos. One respondent commented that their concern includes not only owl bodies but also owl feathers, pictures of owls, and generally, “anything involving an owl.” Among other animals, eagles, bears, and coyotes were frequently cited, and among plants, sage and tobacco were frequently cited.|$|R
50|$|Tier two is {{designed}} to provide interventions to support students who are not responding to tier one prevention strategies. Therefore, tier two approaches offer more support than tier one interventions.

Within tier two, simple functional behavioral assessment (FBA) are used to identify students' functioning to support individualized interventions and strategies. Students' individualized interventions are referred to as behavioral intervention plan (BIP). These two approaches are used to promote positive social interactions.|$|R
5|$|Smuggling off American coasts was {{an issue}} before the Revolutionary War, and after the Revolution it was <b>more</b> <b>problematic.</b> Along with smuggling, lack of {{shipping}} control, pirating, and a revenue unbalance were also major problems. In response, Hamilton proposed to Congress to enact a naval police force called revenue cutters in order to patrol the waters and assist the custom collectors with confiscating contraband. This idea was also proposed to assist in tariff controlling, boosting the American economy, and promote the merchant marine. It is thought that his experience obtained during his apprenticeship with Nicholas Kruger was influential in his decision-making.|$|E
5|$|The people, {{who felt}} the {{severity}} of his laws, {{at the same time}} acknowledged their justice, and found themselves protected from the rapacity of their superiors. Andronikos's energetic efforts to rein in the oppressive tax collectors and officials of the empire did much to alleviate the lot of the peasantry. However, his efforts to check the power of the nobility were considerably <b>more</b> <b>problematic.</b> The aristocrats were infuriated with him, and to make matters worse, Andronikos seems to have become increasingly deranged; executions and violence became increasingly common, and his reign turned into a reign of terror. Andronikos seemed almost to seek the extermination of the aristocracy as a whole. The struggle against the aristocracy turned into wholesale slaughter, as the emperor resorted to ever more ruthless measures to shore up his regime.|$|E
5|$|As {{the riders}} entered the flat lands near the Belgian coast, the winds became <b>more</b> <b>problematic.</b> Around {{three-quarters of the}} peloton had been dropped or had {{withdrawn}} from the race {{by the time the}} riders turned back inland. Gert Steegmans (Trek Factory Racing) was blown sideways into a ditch; the wind knocked several other riders over and caused Martin Velits (Etixx-Quick Step) and Lars Bak (Lotto-Soudal) to withdraw from the race. Mark Cavendish crashed and was forced to chase to attempt to rejoin the leading riders. The conditions were so severe that some team officials called for the race to be neutralised to ensure the riders' safety. Shortly afterwards, two large groups came back together. The main peloton was therefore made up of around 100 riders and was approximately two minutes behind the breakaway. The breakaway was caught soon afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Several {{species of}} fungi infect {{the roots of}} waratahs, causing {{significant}} plant morbidity or death. Typical symptoms include yellow leaves, wilting, blackening and dieback or part {{or all of the}} plant, or lack of proteoid roots. The most common pathogen is the soil-borne water mold Phytophthora cinnamomi, which appears to be <b>more</b> <b>problematic</b> in cultivated plants than in wild populations. Mass plantings at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney and at Mount Annan planted before the 2000 Summer Olympics were devastated by the disease. Rhizoctonia solani can cause damping off or root rot, and is an uncommon pathogen. Cylindrocarpon scoparium and C. destructans (now Nectria radicicola) are also uncommon causes of infection and result in decay of the crown of the plant. Although significant problems, fungi {{are less likely to be}} the cause of plant morbidity than poor drainage or soil conditions.|$|E
5|$|<b>More</b> <b>problematic</b> {{are those}} {{cases where the}} {{movement}} of the Sun at different times and seasons causes light and shadow interactions with petroglyphs. A widely known example is the Sun Dagger of Fajada Butte at which a glint of sunlight passes over a spiral petroglyph. The location of a dagger of light on the petroglyph varies throughout the year. At the summer solstice a dagger can be seen through the heart of the spiral; at the winter solstice two daggers appear to either side of it. It is proposed that this petroglyph was created to mark these events. Recent studies have identified many similar sites in the US Southwest and Northwestern Mexico. It has been argued that the number of solstitial markers at these sites provides statistical evidence that they were intended to mark the solstices. The Sun Dagger site on Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, stands out for its explicit light markings that record all the key events of both the solar and lunar cycles: summer solstice, winter solstice, equinox, and the major and minor lunar standstills of the moon’s 18.6 year cycle. In addition at two other sites on Fajada Butte, there are five light markings on petroglyphs recording the summer and winter solstices, equinox and solar noon. Numerous buildings and interbuilding alignments of the great houses of Chaco Canyon and outlying areas are oriented to the same solar and lunar directions that are marked at the Sun Dagger site.|$|E
5|$|Some {{authors have}} {{proposed}} a broader continuum of definitions of attachment disorders ranging from RAD through various attachment difficulties to the <b>more</b> <b>problematic</b> attachment styles. There is as yet no consensus, on this issue but {{a new set of}} practice parameters containing three categories of attachment disorder has been proposed by C.H. Zeanah and N. Boris. The first of these is disorder of attachment, in which a young child has no preferred adult caregiver. The proposed category of disordered attachment is parallel to RAD in its inhibited and disinhibited forms, as defined in DSM and ICD. The second category is secure base distortion, where the child has a preferred familiar caregiver, but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment. Such children may endanger themselves, cling to the adult, be excessively compliant, or show role reversals in which they care for or punish the adult. The third type is disrupted attachment. Disrupted attachment is not covered under ICD-10 and DSM criteria, and results from an abrupt separation or loss of a familiar caregiver to whom attachment has developed. This form of categorisation may demonstrate more clinical accuracy overall than the current DSM-IV-TR classification, but further research is required. The practice parameters would also provide the framework for a diagnostic protocol. Most recently, Daniel Schechter and Erica Willheim have shown a relationship between some maternal violence-related posttraumatic stress disorder and secure base distortion (see above) which is characterized by child recklessness, separation anxiety, hypervigilance, and role-reversal.|$|E

40|$|In this essay, {{the authors}} argue that {{although}} "South" and "North" {{are more and}} <b>more</b> becoming <b>problematic</b> categories in the social sciences, in general, and in migration studies, in particular, it still makes sense today to focus on South-South migrations. Not only because of its mere quantitative importance, but for a number of reasons. Firstly, new South-South migration patterns are observable and new data are becoming available. Secondly, South-South migrations still have a number of distinct features, including: the role of borders, the composition of migration flows, the migration-conflict nexus, regional migration governance, and the specific relationships with certain migration-related concepts and variables. 10 page(s...|$|R
5|$|The order Rodentia may {{be divided}} into suborders, infraorders, superfamilies and families. There {{is a great deal}} of {{parallelism}} and convergence among rodents caused by the fact that they have tended to evolve to fill largely similar niches. This parallel evolution includes not only the structure of the teeth, but also the infraorbital region of the skull (below the eye socket) and makes classification difficult as similar traits may not be due to common ancestry. Brandt (1855) was the first to propose dividing Rodentia into three suborders, Sciuromorpha, Hystricomorpha and Myomorpha, based on the development of certain muscles in the jaw and this system was widely accepted. Schlosser (1884) performed a comprehensive review of rodent fossils, mainly using the cheek teeth, and found that they fitted into the classical system, but Tullborg (1899) proposed just two sub-orders, Sciurognathi and Hystricognathi. These were based on the degree of inflection of the lower jaw and were to be further subdivided into Sciuromorpha, Myomorpha, Hystricomorpha and Bathyergomorpha. Matthew (1910) created a phylogenetic tree of New World rodents but did not include the <b>more</b> <b>problematic</b> Old World species. Further attempts at classification continued without agreement, with some authors adopting the classical three suborder system and others Tullborg's two suborders.|$|E
