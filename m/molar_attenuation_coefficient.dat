5000|$|In chemistry, mass <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> {{are often}} used for a {{chemical}} species dissolved in a solution. In that case, the mass <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient</b> {{is defined by the}} same equation, except that the [...] "density" [...] is the density of only that one chemical species, and the [...] "attenuation" [...] is the attenuation due to only that one chemical species.

50|$|Therefore, {{measurements}} at two wavelengths yields two equations in two unknowns {{and will}} suffice {{to determine the}} amount concentrations c1 and c2 {{as long as the}} <b>molar</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient</b> of the two components, ε1 and ε2 are known at both wavelengths. This two system equation can be solved using Cramer's rule. In practice it is better to use linear least squares to determine the two amount concentrations from measurements made at more than two wavelengths. Mixtures containing more than two components can be analyzed in the same way, using a minimum of N wavelengths for a mixture containing N components.|$|E

30|$|Our study {{demonstrated}} that the lateral variation of <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> estimated by the proposed method can identify sharp lateral discontinuities such as lithological boundaries and fracture zones. Estimating <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> separately from positive- and negative-offset data is effective in identifying lithological boundaries. We also {{demonstrated that}} <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> are more sensitive to localized fractures than phase velocities, although both <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> and phase velocities are sensitive to lithological boundaries. Therefore, simultaneous interpretation of lateral variation of <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> and that of phase velocities has a potential to distinguish lithological boundaries from the localized lateral discontinuities (fractures associated with faults). This ability would be valuable in applications such as fluid injection studies, where it may allow localized fractures to be detected using conventional seismic data.|$|R
