5|$|Hyperbaric oxygen is {{also used}} in the {{treatment}} of carbon monoxide poisoning, as it may hasten dissociation of CO from carboxyhemoglobin and cytochrome oxidase {{to a greater extent than}} normal oxygen. Hyperbaric oxygen at three times atmospheric pressure reduces the half life of carbon monoxide to 23 (~80/3 minutes) minutes, compared to 80 minutes for oxygen at regular atmospheric pressure. It may also enhance oxygen transport to the tissues by plasma, partially bypassing the normal transfer through hemoglobin. However, it is controversial whether hyperbaric oxygen actually offers any extra benefits over normal high flow oxygen, in terms of increased survival or improved long-term outcomes. There have been randomized controlled trials in which the two treatment options have been compared; of the six performed, four found hyperbaric oxygen improved outcome and two found no benefit for hyperbaric oxygen. Some of these trials have been criticized for apparent flaws in their implementation. A review of all the literature on carbon monoxide poisoning treatment concluded that the role of hyperbaric oxygen is unclear and the available evidence neither confirms nor denies a medically meaningful benefit. The authors suggested a large, well designed, externally audited, <b>multicentre</b> <b>trial</b> to compare normal oxygen with hyperbaric oxygen.|$|E

2500|$|There are two serious {{technical}} {{problems associated with}} the development of a vaccine against H5N1.

[...] The second problem is this: there are two circulating clades of virus, clade 1 is the virus originally isolated in Vietnam, clade 2 is the virus isolated in Indonesia. Vaccine research has mostly been focused on clade 1 viruses, but the clade 2 virus is antigenically distinct and a clade 1 vaccine will probably not protect against a pandemic caused by clade 2 virus.|$|E

5000|$|Anticonvulsants - {{there is}} {{evidence}} that lamotrigine decreases the risk of relapse in rapid cycling bipolar II. It appears to be more effective in bipolar II than bipolar I, suggesting that lamotrigine is more effective for the treatment of depressive rather than manic episodes. Doses ranging from 100-200 mg have been reported to have the most efficacy, while experimental doses of 400 mg have rendered little response. A large, <b>multicentre</b> <b>trial</b> comparing carbamazepine and lithium over {{two and a half years}} found that carbamazepine was superior in terms of preventing future episodes of bipolar II, although lithium was superior in individuals with bipolar I.

We argue that most, if not all, <b>multicentre</b> <b>trials</b> have reassessment of the recruitment strategy and study processes whilst the study is running.

40|$|RATIONALE: Trials of new {{treatments}} for neurological disorders like stroke require imaging {{as part of}} the patient assessment, but need to be large enough to obtain reliable results if treatment effects are likely to be modest. However, <b>multicentre</b> <b>trials</b> use many different scanners in different hospitals and present complex problems for image data collection, interpretation and analysis and long-term secure archiving. AIMS: NeuroGrid aims to develop and test grid technologies for collecting, analysing and interpreting, and secure archiving of neuroimaging data for large <b>multicentre</b> <b>trials</b> in common neurological and psychiatric disorders. DESIGN: A 3 -year multicentre consortium of clinicians, neuroimaging centres and e-scientists are designing a Grid storage network, mechanisms for uploading, curating and retrieving image and metadata, combining image data from different scanners and an analysis tool box. Three clinical exemplars [...] stroke, dementia and psychosis [...] provide the data and 'real-world' clinical trial applications, and a set of specific and typical problems encountered with image data in <b>multicentre</b> <b>trials</b> for NeuroGrid to address. The stroke exemplar is using image data from two multicentre stroke trials: Third International Stroke Trial and Efficacy of Nitric Oxide in Stroke. OUTCOMES: The final product is intended to appear as an integrated capability consisting of services, both database and analyses, accessed through simple portals. These will include image submission, automated scan quality control, appropriate metadata linkage, streamlined image review and coding tools and long-term secure storage for future <b>multicentre</b> stroke <b>trials...</b>|$|R
40|$|Molecular imaging with PET {{has emerged}} as a {{powerful}} imaging tool in the clinical care of oncological patients. Assessing therapy response is a prime application of PET and so the integration of PET into <b>multicentre</b> <b>trials</b> can offer valuable scientific insights and shape future clinical practice. However, {{there are a number of}} logistic and methodological challenges that have to be dealt with. These range from availability and regulatory compliance of the PET radiopharmaceutical to availability of scan time for research purposes. Standardization of imaging and reconstruction protocols, quality control, image processing and analysis are of paramount importance. Strategies for harmonization of the final image and the quantification result are available and can be implemented within the scope of multicentre accreditation programmes. Data analysis can be performed either locally or by centralized review. Response assessment can be done visually or using more quantitative approaches, depending on the research question. Large-scale real-time centralized review can be achieved using web-based solutions. Specific challenges for the future are inclusion of PET/MRI scanners in <b>multicentre</b> <b>trials</b> and the incorporation of radiomic analyses. Inclusion of PET in <b>multicentre</b> <b>trials</b> is a necessity to guarantee the further development of PET for routine clinical care and may yield very valuable scientific insights. status: publishe...|$|R
