5000|$|Saint Peters bell (orig. German: St. Petersglocke, {{referred}} to in the Colognian language as Decke or Dekke Pitter and in common parlance as Dicker Pitter i.e. Fat or Big Peter) is the largest bell in Cologne Cathedral. It was cast in 1923 by Heinrich Ulrich in Apolda and hangs in the belfry of the south tower. With a weight of approximately 24,000 kg, a clapper weighing ~700 kg and a diameter of 322 cm, it is the largest (horizontally <b>mounted)</b> <b>freely</b> swinging ringable bell in the world.|$|E
40|$|Engine {{vibrations}} {{have been}} one of the major problems for the engine manufacturers in the world. The engine excitation forces, arising from the gas pressure and unbalance forces are the sources of vibrations. Anti Vibration Mounts(AVMs) are the structures used to absorb the vibrations and dampen the harm causing forces. Mount result in a system which is modeled as mass/spring/damper. The elastomer is under vertical and shear load at the same time. The engine is bolted freely on mount which dampens the vibrations going to the base frame/canopy. The validation of their characteristics is implemented in a single degree of freedom system with response to frequency domain. The engine is <b>mounted</b> <b>freely</b> on the AVM’s which helps to dampen the vibrations to base frame. Frequency Response Function(FRF) is derived for analysis, analytically and Computer Aided Engineering(CAE). Comparative is also made to suggest which material is to be selected for AVMs. A single AVM is analyzed for modal and frequency response with the upper plate as a part of engine structure and the bottom plate as the base frame. Comparative study of the two conditions using materials and also without mount and with mount is analyzed...|$|E

40|$|Directly {{comparable}} drag measurements {{have been}} made of an airfoil with a conventional rectangular plan form and an airfoil with a sweptback plan form <b>mounted</b> on <b>freely</b> falling bodies. Both airfoils had NACA 65 - 009 sections and were identical in span, frontal area, and chord perpendicular to the leading edge. The sweptback plan form incorporated a sweepback angle of 45 degrees. The data obtained {{have been used to}} establish the relation between the airfoil drag coefficients and the free-stream Mach number over a range of Mach numbers from 0. 90 to 1. 27. The results of the measurements indicate that the drag of the sweptback plan form is less than 0. 3 that of the rectangular plan form at a Mach number of 1. 00 and is less than 0. 4 that at a Mach number of 1. 20...|$|R

40|$|We {{standardized}} {{conditions for}} ex vivo mouse limb culture to study cartilage maturation and joint formation. We compared 12. 5 d. p. c. mouse forelimbs that were cultured either <b>mounted</b> or <b>freely</b> rotating {{for up to}} 72 h. Limb outgrowth progressed ex vivo at a variable rate as compared to its development in vivo, spanning approximately 48 h. Although cartilage maturation and joint formation developed grossly normal, aberrant expression of skeletal marker genes was seen. Interestingly, no regression of the interdigital webs took place in mounted cultures, in contrast to limited webbing under freely rotating conditions. Caspase inhibition, by addition of zVAD-fmk to the culture medium of freely rotating limbs, supported proper gene expression associated with skeletal development, and prevented interdigital web regression. Taken together, a freely rotating ex vivo culture for mouse limb outgrowth that is combined with caspase inhibition provides a good model to study cartilage maturation and joint formation. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|The Gasometer {{was built}} by Gutehoffnungshütte, {{by the side of}} the Rhine-Herne Canal. Construction started 27 February 1927 and cost 1.74 million Reichsmark. A {{framework}} of 24 steel girders was built on a concrete base, and a skin of 5mm thick sheet metal was riveted to the framework.

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{report a}} type of device that {{combines}} vertical arrays of one-dimensional (1 D) pillar-superlattice (PSL) structures with 2 D graphene sheets to yield a class of light emitting diode (LED) with interesting mechanical, optical, and electrical characteristics. In this application, graphene sheets coated with very thin metal layers exhibit good mechanical and electrical properties {{and an ability to}} <b>mount,</b> in a <b>freely</b> suspended configuration, on the PSL arrays as a top window electrode. Optical characterization demonstrates that graphene exhibits excellent optical transparency even after deposition of the thin metal films. Thermal annealing of the graphene/ metal (Gr/M) contact to the GaAs decreases the contact resistance, to provide enhanced carrier injection. The resulting PSL-Gr/M LEDs exhibit bright light emission over large areas. The result suggests the utility of graphene-based materials as electrodes in devices with unusual, nonplanar 3 D architectures...|$|R
25|$|In {{the center}} of the hall is a large open square, above which is a domed ceiling about 10 feet in {{diameter}} and 6 feet deep. At the top is a lotus bud with Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva carved on it. At the bottom of the dome is a series of friezes with the Ramayana story. On the capitals of the four pillars are madanikas (Salabhanjika). One represents dancing Saraswati, the Hindu god of knowledge, arts and music. The others are regular dancers, but with different expressions. One is dressing her hair, the other in a Natya posture, and the fourth has a parrot seated on her hand. The head and neck jewelry made of rock are <b>freely</b> <b>mounted</b> and can be moved. The bracelets similarly are moveable. The design of the celing follows the Hindu texts, and is a modified utksipta style with images placed in concentric rings.|$|R
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} they stood in open air, and once more breathed <b>freely.</b> <b>Mounting</b> their horses, they ascended the steep slope of the hill above the cave, and, after some trouble, reached the summit. Here {{the first thing that}} met their gaze was a camp-fire, and near to it several men engaged in {{harnessing}} their horses to a large waggon or van. The frantic haste with which they performed the operation convinced Ned that he had discovered the cause of the mysterious voices, and that he and Tom had been the innocent cause of frightening the strangers nearly out of their wits. So engrossed were they with their work, that our travellers advanced within the circle of light of their fire before they were discovered. The man who first saw them uttered a yell, and the whole party turned round, seized their rifles, and, with terror depicted on their countenances, faced the intruders.|$|R
40|$|We study {{experimentally}} {{the fracture}} dynamics during the peeling {{at a constant}} velocity of a roller adhesive tape <b>mounted</b> on a <b>freely</b> rotating pulley. Thanks to a high speed camera, we measure, in an intermediate range of peeling velocities, high frequency oscillations between phases of slow and rapid propagation of the peeling fracture. This so-called stick-slip regime is well known as the consequence of a decreasing fracture energy of the adhesive in a certain range of peeling velocity coupled to the elasticity of the peeled tape. Simultaneously with stick-slip, we observe low frequency oscillations of the adhesive roller angular velocity which are the consequence of a pendular instability of the roller submitted to the peeling force. The stick-slip dynamics is shown to become intermittent due to these slow pendular oscillations which produce a quasi-static oscillation of the peeling angle while keeping constant the peeling fracture velocity (averaged over each stick-slip cycle). The observed correlation between the mean peeling angle and the stick-slip amplitude questions {{the validity of the}} usually admitted independence with the peeling angle of the fracture energy of adhesives.

40|$|Recently, the {{rotational}} {{particle separator}} (RPS) was introduced {{as a new}} technique for separating solid and/or liquid particles of 0. 1 m and larger from gases. In this patented technique the principles of centrifugation are exploited to enhance separation of small-sized phases and particulate matter of density different from the carrier fluid. Practical designs of the RPS available in the market include equipment for purifying gases of industrial processes and portable air cleaners for domestic appliances. New developments {{are made in the}} area of the offshore industry. It concerns the separation of oil droplets from water and the separation of condensate, oil, and sand from natural gas. A particular feature of both designs is that the filter element is <b>freely</b> <b>mounted</b> in bearings and rotates, without the need of a motor, by introducing a swirl in the fluid flowing towards the filter element. The design is particularly suited for operation under high pressures as the rotating filter element is fully contained within a cylindrical pipe.

40|$|A novel {{method has}} been {{developed}} to map activation in the triangle of Koch during surgery for cardiac arrhythmias and relate the map to anatomic landmarks. It uses a hand-held electrode <b>mounted</b> in a <b>freely</b> moving linkage that has three degrees of mechanical freedom. The movements of the linkage are sensed by a computer that continuously calculates the coordinates of the electrode. The surgeon clamps the device over the triangle of Koch after the right atrium has been opened and uses the electrode to trace the anatomic landmarks of the region that are displayed on the computer screen. The position of the electrode is displayed continuously relative to these landmarks and electrograms are recorded at known positions to generate a map. The activation sequences during sinus rhythm, atrioventricular node reentrant tachycardia, “common” and “uncommon” atrial flutter, long RP' tachycardia and retrograde conduction through paranodal pathways are presented. It is concluded that 1) the high spatial resolution reveals physiologically important areas in the maps that are 8 mm long and 3 mm wide and that these areas {{can be related to}} specific anatomic landmarks; 2) there are complex electrograms in the region that may reflect the activation of different myocardial layers; and 3) there are marked changes in conduction velocity and direction within the region...|$|R
40|$|The {{influences}} of a flexibly mounted cylinder and a fixed cylinder on the flow field in regular waves are studied numerically. Performances of the flexibly <b>mounted</b> cylinder oscillating <b>freely</b> in still water and in regular waves are first simulated. Then the in-line {{forces on the}} two cylinders in regular waves are compared to the theoretical results. All results indicate the present model is valid. Then the entire flow fields induced by the two cylinders are analyzed in detail. The windward and leeward regions of the cylinder are each divided into eight sections. Results of the windward side are complex because of the superposition of incoming and reflected waves. Results of the leeward side show that the sectional average wave height decreases as the wave frequency increases. In general, the flexibly mounted cylinder attenuates wave energy more effectively. Moreover, the wave frequency {{is a major factor}} influencing the flow field. When the incident wave frequency approaches the natural frequency of the cylinder, differences of the two data sets become significant. Distance between the section and the cylinder is another influential factor. The two sets of results become more similar as the distance increases, especially in cases of low incident wave frequencies. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
