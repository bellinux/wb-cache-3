They used a system of coloured lights for recognition signals between ships, which the British could not duplicate, whereas the British used plain flashed <b>morse</b> <b>signals,</b> which the Germans were partly able to copy after once seeing them, giving some advantage when ships met.

50|$|Meanwhile, {{a second}} station was also {{measuring}} {{the distance to}} the bomber. This station was equipped with the bomb's range value calculated earlier, and had used this to calculate the distance between their station and the bomber {{at the point where the}} bombs needed to be dropped. When this mouse station saw the bomber approaching the drop point, it sent a series of <b>Morse</b> code <b>signals</b> to inform the pilot that the drop point was approaching. At the precise instant, it would send another <b>morse</b> <b>signal</b> that would drop the bombs automatically.|$|R

2500|$|Testimony {{before the}} British inquiry {{revealed}} that at 10:10p.m., Californian observed {{the lights of}} a ship to the south; it was later agreed between Captain Stanley Lord and Third Officer C.V. Groves (who had relieved Lord of duty at 11:10p.m.) {{that this was a}} passenger liner. At 11:50p.m., the officer had watched that ship's lights flash out, as if she had shut down or turned sharply, and that the port light was now visible. Morse light signals to the ship, upon Lord's order, were made between 11:30p.m. and 1:00a.m., but were not acknowledged. [...] If Titanic were as far from the Californian as Lord claimed, then he knew, or should have known, that <b>Morse</b> <b>signals</b> would not be visible. [...] A reasonable and prudent course of action would have been to awaken the wireless operator and to instruct him to attempt to contact Titanic by that method. [...] Had Lord done so, it is possible he could have reached Titanic in time to save additional lives.|$|E
2500|$|... "Superheterodyne" [...] is a {{contraction}} of [...] "supersonic heterodyne", where [...] "supersonic" [...] indicates frequencies above {{the range of}} human hearing. The word heterodyne {{is derived from the}} Greek roots hetero- [...] "different", and -dyne [...] "power". In radio applications the term derives from the [...] "heterodyne detector" [...] pioneered by Canadian inventor Reginald Fessenden in 1905, describing his proposed method of producing an audible signal from the Morse code transmissions of the new continuous wave transmitters. With the older spark gap transmitters then in use, the Morse code signal consisted of short bursts of a heavily modulated carrier wave, which could be clearly heard as a series of short chirps or buzzes in the receiver's headphones. However, the signal from a continuous wave transmitter did not have any such inherent modulation and Morse Code from one of those would only be heard as a series of clicks or thumps. Fessenden's idea was to run two Alexanderson alternators, one producing a carrier frequency 3kHz higher than the other. In the receiver's detector the two carriers would beat together to produce a 3kHz tone thus in the headphones the <b>Morse</b> <b>signals</b> would then be heard as a series of 3kHz beeps. For this he coined the term [...] "heterodyne" [...] meaning [...] "generated by a difference" [...] (in frequency).|$|E

50|$|During the era between World War I and World War II, {{a number}} of systems were {{introduced}} that placed the rotating antenna on the ground. As the antenna rotated through a fixed position, typically due north, the antenna was keyed with the <b>morse</b> code <b>signal</b> of the station's identification letters so the receiver could ensure they were listening to the right station. Then {{they waited for the}} signal to either peak or disappear as the antenna briefly pointed in their direction. By timing the delay between the <b>morse</b> <b>signal</b> and the peak/null, then dividing by the known rotational rate of the station, the bearing of the station could be calculated.|$|R

A development of this system was to include a unit called the Luftkurier which decoded the Morse and indicated commands on a pointer (left/right).

40|$|A {{model for}} the {{perception}} of some <b>Morse</b> Code-like <b>signals</b> is developed, tested, and generalized. In the development certain f o r d relations among the signals provide the bases for hypotheses concerning the relative confusabiriry of signal pairs. The measure of confusability used in testing the hypotheses is the percentage of "same " responses to each pair in a Same-Different judgment task. The judgment data give very strong support lo the hypotheses of the model. Multidimensional andyses of the data matrix reveal three prominent dimensions which are interpreted as Temporal Length, Sound-to-Silence Ratio, and Dash!First-Dot First. Finally, a generalization of the model is described. INTRODUCIION The primary aims of this paper are to develop, test, and generalize a {{model for the}} perception of some <b>Morse</b> Code-like <b>signals.</b> In developing this model the following steps will be taken: 1. The set of <b>Morse</b> Code-like <b>signals</b> will be described; 2. Relations of order and betweenness will be defined on the set of signals; 3. Hypotheses will be proposed which relate the relative confusability of pairs of signals to these formal relations of order and betweenness. Although some of the concepts of facet theory (Guttman, 1959, 1965) will be utilized in the de-velopment, the particular terminology will not be used. This model is similar to one previously devel-oped by the author for International <b>Morse</b> Code (IMC) <b>signals</b> (Wish, 1967). The hypotheses of the earlier model were strongly supported by data from an experiment by Rothkopf (1957). An ex-periment similar to Rothkopf's provides the data which will be used to test the current model. ...|$|R
