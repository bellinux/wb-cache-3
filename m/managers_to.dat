5|$|Armour {{became the}} first manager who held the title of manager for the Indians {{for more than one}} season. Boudreau has managed more games (1383) than any other Indians manager, closely {{followed}} by Hargrove (1364). Charlie Manuel, Eric Wedge, Speaker, Boudreau, Lopez, and Hargrove are the only <b>managers</b> <b>to</b> have led the Indians into the playoffs. Speaker, Boudreau, Lopez, Walter Johnson, Joe Gordon, Nap Lajoie and Frank Robinson are the seven members of the Baseball Hall of Fame who are also former managers of this club. Of those seven, Lopez is the only one inducted as a manager.|$|E
5|$|Baseball writer-scorers usually {{worked at}} the games played at the home stadium of the team which they covered for their newspaper. The writer-scorers were tasked with making {{objective}} decisions that could impact the statistics of the team they were writing about.

5|$|In August 2000, NASA asked project <b>managers</b> <b>to</b> {{consider}} {{looking at}} the Space Shuttle, instead of the previously proposed EELV, as a launch vehicle. In late November 2000, NASA announced that the project's scientific team was selected. The group included notable names {{from the world of}} extrasolar planet research including Geoffrey Marcy. The entire group consisted of 10 principal investigators and five mission specialists. At the time of this NASA announcement launch was scheduled for 2009 and the mission was still part of the Origins Program.|$|E

A replica sits in the Directors' Entrance at Emirates Stadium; {{he is one of}} only two Arsenal <b>managers</b> <b>to</b> be honoured this way, the other being current manager Arsène Wenger. Furthermore, Arsenal's white away kit for the 2007–08 season was dedicated to Chapman and his achievements.|$|E

5|$|On February 20, 2007, Major League Baseball and Rawlings {{announced}} that an all-time Gold Glove Team would be named during the 50th {{anniversary of the}} first Gold Glove Awards. Rawlings asked 70 baseball reporters, former players and former <b>managers</b> <b>to</b> select 50 names for the ballot, from an initial selection of 250 names. The team was selected by fans, who voted at the Rawlings Gold Glove website, at United States Postal Service offices, and at sporting goods stores. The results were announced at the 2007 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} wage rates and wage scales was {{drastically}} reduced; {{this not only}} cut bureaucracy, but also ensured that workers would be more eager {{to take on a}} wider range of tasks. Time workers, for example, would be paid the same regardless of which task they carried out during their shift. This allowed <b>managers</b> <b>to</b> better distribute labour and reduce the frequency of bottlenecks occurring in production. They could do this because workers would be paid a similar rate no matter what they undertook, so it became easier to move workers between tasks.|$|E
5|$|The team {{now known}} as the Cleveland Indians has played under several monikers since its {{inception}} in 1901, including the Cleveland Blues or Bluebirds, the Cleveland Bronchos, and the Cleveland Naps (so named because of popular player and manager Nap Lajoie). Forty managers have led the team, starting with Jimmy McAleer, since it was established in Cleveland, Ohio in 1901. Lajoie was the first manager in team history to finish his career with a winning record. Lou Boudreau leads all Indians managers with 728 wins and 649 losses. He and Tris Speaker are the only <b>managers</b> <b>to</b> win a championship with Cleveland: Speaker in 1920 and Boudreau in 1948, the last championship for the franchise. Other <b>managers</b> <b>to</b> appear in the postseason with Cleveland include Al López, Mike Hargrove (who leads the team in playoff wins and losses with a record of 27–24), Charlie Manuel, and Eric Wedge. The current manager is Terry Francona.|$|E
40|$|At its core, {{the success}} of active {{management}} rests upon {{the ability of the}} portfolio <b>manager</b> <b>to</b> differentiate assets along meaningful dimensions.

50|$|The Rio {{fell into}} {{foreclosure}} in 1984 and {{was acquired by}} an Israeli family, the Mandelbrots, who hired a <b>manager</b> <b>to</b> run it. In January 1993 it was purchased by Monte Rio residents Don and Suzi Schaffert. The Schafferts had intended to allow the Mandelbrots' <b>manager</b> <b>to</b> continue overseeing the theater until they learned he was allowing a friend {{to live in the}} Rio and engage in illicit activities. After the Schafferts asked the <b>manager</b> <b>to</b> evict his friend, the two men vandalized the interior by spray-painting the screen and damaging the electrical panel.|$|R

The use of the artificial intelligence of Watson has also {{been found in the}} hospitality industry. GoMoment uses Watson for its Rev1 app, which gives hotel staff a way to quickly respond to questions from guests. Arria NLG has built an app that helps energy companies stay within regulatory guidelines, making it easier for <b>managers</b> <b>to</b> make sense of thousands of pages of legal and technical jargon.|$|E
5|$|Bouldering {{can damage}} {{vegetation}} that grows on rocks, such as mosses and lichens. This can {{occur as a}} result of the climber intentionally cleaning the boulder, or unintentionally from repeated use of handholds and footholds. Vegetation on the ground surrounding the boulder can also be damaged from overuse, particularly by climbers laying down crash pads. Soil erosion can occur when boulderers trample vegetation while hiking off of established trails, or when they unearth small rocks near the boulder in an effort to make the landing zone safer. The repeated use of white climbing chalk can damage the rock surface of boulders and cliffs, particularly sandstone and other porous rock types, and the scrubbing of rocks to remove chalk can also degrade the rock surface. Other environmental concerns include littering, improperly disposed feces, and graffiti. These issues have caused some land <b>managers</b> <b>to</b> prohibit bouldering, as was the case in Tea Garden, a popular bouldering area in Rocklands, South Africa.|$|E
5|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, {{television}} {{networks in the}} United States were restricted to owning {{no more than five}} local VHF television stations. This system, which evolved from similar FCC regulations governing radio, resulted in executives of {{television networks}} forming alliances with local station owners in order to air network programs across the U.S. These alliances were codified in network affiliation contracts; Paramount Television Network staff required affiliate station <b>managers</b> <b>to</b> sign a network contract even if the station only aired one Paramount program. At its peak in late 1950, the Paramount Television Network was distributing five television series a week to over 40 affiliated television stations. Most Paramount stations were in the United States, but at least two were Canadian stations.|$|E

5|$|Some {{theories}} {{attempt to}} explain Daily's tempestuous behaviour, {{one of which was}} put forth by Frank Vaccaro in his 1999 edition of The National Pastime. His theory explains that, in Daily's day, except in cases of injury, for a pitcher to be relieved from his position, another player already in the game would have to relieve him, and the pitcher would have to take a position in the field. His physical condition did not allow him many opportunities to play any other positions, so this compelled his <b>managers</b> <b>to</b> leave him in the game longer, even when his performance was declining. He was allowed to play in the field on several occasions, when the situation warranted it, as he is credited as playing three games in the outfield, two at second base, and one at shortstop.|$|E
5|$|The Pittsburgh Pirates {{joined the}} National League in 1887 after five seasons {{as members of}} the American Association. Al Pratt was the first manager in {{franchise}} history, while the first manager after joining Major League Baseball was Horace B. Phillips. The manager is currently Clint Hurdle. Fred Clarke, who managed from 1900 through 1915, holds franchise records in wins and losses (1422–969), as well as winning percentage among managers who led the team for a full season or more (.595). Clarke was the first manager to lead the team to the postseason and to win a World Series; other <b>managers</b> <b>to</b> do so include Bill McKechnie (one playoff appearance, one World Series victory), Chuck Tanner (one playoff appearance, one World Series victory), and Danny Murtaugh, who leads franchise managers with two World Series victories and five playoff appearances.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the public}} commented that {{although}} some events were sold out, {{there appeared to be}} many unoccupied seats at venues, and claimed that this was because the Ministry of Education (MOE) made a block purchase of 87,000 passes to be given to schools. However, students usually did not stay for the full duration of sessions, which can be up to seven hours long. The MOE denied that students were to blame, stating that more than 95% of students allocated tickets had attended events, and that some schools had asked to purchase additional tickets due to overwhelming demand. The SYOGOC announced that once sessions had begun, unoccupied seats would be resold to people who turned up in person at venues. To enable venue <b>managers</b> <b>to</b> gauge the number of seats available for resale, teachers escorting students to events were instructed to inform venue managers if they intended to leave before sessions ended and the number of seats occupied by students. On 20 August, the organisers reported that tickets were sold out for all 26 sports except girls' football.|$|E

5|$|The Minnesota {{franchise}} {{began its}} {{life as the}} Washington Senators in Washington, D. C., where they played from their inception in 1901 to 1960. In the early 20th century, the Senators were managed consecutively by three future members of the Baseball Hall of Fame, bookended by Bucky Harris, who managed the team from 1924 to 1928 and again from 1935 to 1942. Walter Johnson, who {{was inducted into the}} Hall of Fame as a player, managed the team for four seasons from 1929 to 1932, and he was followed by Joe Cronin, also inducted as a player, who led for the next two seasons (1933–1934). Clark Griffith is the only other Hall of Famer to manage the Senators/Twins franchise. In 1960, the American League awarded an expansion franchise to Minneapolis, Minnesota; however, owner Calvin Griffith moved his team to Minnesota, and Washington was awarded the expansion team instead. Thus, the Minnesota Twins began play in Minnesota the following year, during the tenure of manager Cookie Lavagetto. Harris and Tom Kelly are the two <b>managers</b> <b>to</b> win a World Series championship with the franchise, one in the Senators era (Harris) and two during the team's tenure in Minnesota (Kelly). Kelly is also the franchise leader in wins and losses, the only manager to exceed 1,000 in each category (1,140–1,244 in 16 seasons). Ron Gardenhire was fired of managerial duties in October 2014, as he was replaced by Paul Molitor.|$|E
5|$|The San Diego Padres joined Major League Baseball as an {{expansion}} team in 1969. Preston Gómez managed {{the team from}} the inaugural season until 1972. In total, the franchise has had 16 managers. Bud Black was employed in the position since being hired prior to the 2007 season, and he was fired on June 15, 2015. He was replaced by Dave Roberts for 1 game. Then Pat Murphy took over. Bruce Bochy is the manager with the longest tenure, leading the team for 12 seasons from 1995 through 2006. Bochy is also the only Padres skipper to win the Manager of the Year Award, and leads the team in regular-season wins (951) and losses (975), as well as playoff wins (8) and losses (16). The franchise leader in winning percentage among managers who have led the team for a full season or more is Jack McKeon (.541 over three seasons). Besides Bochy, Dick Williams is the only Padres manager to lead the team to a National League pennant; Williams won 337 games in his four seasons with the club {{and is the only}} one of San Diego's sixteen <b>managers</b> <b>to</b> be elected to the Hall of Fame. On October 29, 2015, Andy Green was named manager of the San Diego Padres.|$|E
5|$|The Spotlight Tribute {{held during}} the 32nd edition of Mill Valley Film Festival hosted an {{interview}} with Reitman and a screening of Up in the Air on Wednesday October 14, 2009 in the Smith Rafael Film Center, San Rafael, California. The Mill Valley Film Festival ran from October 8 to October 18, 2009. It was also shown four times at the 53rd London Film Festival which was held from October 14–19, 2009. Up in the Air was the only American film {{to compete for the}} Golden Marc'Aurelio Audience Award for Best Film at the fourth annual International Rome Film Festival which ran from October 15 through October 23, 2009. It was shown three times from October 17 to October 19, 2009. Reitman showed Up in the Air at ShowEast in Orlando, Florida on October 26 and October 27, 2009, and asked for the movie theater owners and <b>managers</b> <b>to</b> support the picture as fervently as they did his film Juno two years earlier.
