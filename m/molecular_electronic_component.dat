40|$|The {{idea that}} a single {{molecule}} might function as a self-contained electronic device has been of interest for some time. However, a fully integrated version [...] the biochip or the biocomputer, in which both production and assembly of <b>molecular</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>components</b> is achieved through biotechnology-is a relatively new concept that is currently attracting attention both within the scientific community and among the general public. In the present article we draw together some of the approaches being considered {{for the construction of}} such devices and delineate the revolutionary nature of the current proposals for <b>molecular</b> <b>electronic</b> devices (MEDs) and biochip computers (BCCs). With the silicon semiconductor conductor industry already in place and in view of the continuing successes of the lithographic process it seems appropriate to ask why the highly speculative MED or BCC has engendered such interest. In some respects the answer is paradigmatic {{as much as it is}} real. It is perhaps best stated as the promise of the realm of the molecular. Thus it is envisioned that devices will be constructed by assembly of individual <b>molecular</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>components</b> into arrays, thereby engineering from small upward rather than large downward as do current lithographic techniques. An important corollary of the construction technique is that the functional elements of such an array would be individual molecules rather than macroscopic ensembles. These two aspects of the MED/BCC [...] assembly of molecular arrays and individually accessible functional molecular units [...] are truly revolutionary. Both require scientific breakthroughs and the necessary principles, quite apart from the technology, remain essentially unknown. It is concluded that the advent of the MED/BCC still lies well before us. The twin criteria of utilization of individual molecules as functional elements and the assembly of such elements remains as elusive as ever. Biology engineers structures on the molecular scale but biomolecules do not seem to be imbued with useful <b>electronic</b> properties. <b>Molecular</b> beam epitaxy and thin-film techniques produce electronic devices but they "engineer down" and are currently unable to generate individual molecular units.

40|$|Abstract. Self-assembly {{provides}} a simple route to organise suitable organic molecules on noble metal and selected nanocluster surfaces by using monolayers of long chain organic molecules with various functionalities like –SH, –COOH,–NH 2, silanes etc. These surfaces can be effectively used to build-up interesting nano level architectures. Flexibility {{with respect to}} the terminal functionalities of the organic molecules allows the control of the hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of metal surface, while the selection of length scale can be used to tune the distant-d pendent electron transfer behaviour. Organo-inorganic materials tailored in this fashion are extremely important in nanotechnology to construct nanoelctronic devices, sensor arrays, supercapacitors, catalyss, rechargeable power sources etc. by virtue of their size and shape-dependent electrical, optical or magnetic properties.

40|$|Article first {{published}} online: 20 FEB 2015 Understanding the electronic properties of single peptides {{is not only}} of fundamental importance, {{but it is also}} paramount to the realization of peptide-based <b>molecular</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>components.</b> Electrochemical and theoretical studies are reported on two β-strand-based peptides, one with its backbone constrained with a triazole-containing tether introduced by Huisgen cycloaddition (peptide 1) and the other a direct linear analogue (peptide 2). Density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's function were used to investigate conductance in molecular junctions containing peptides 3 and 4 (analogues of 1 and 2). Although the peptides share a common β-strand conformation, they display vastly different electronic transport properties due to the presence (or absence) of the side-bridge constraint and the associated effect on backbone rigidity. These studies reveal that the electron transfer rate constants of 1 and 2, and the conductance calculated for 3 and 4, differ by approximately one order of magnitude, thus providing two distinctly different conductance states and what is essentially a molecular switch. A definitive correlation of electrochemical measurements and molecular junction conductance simulations is demonstrated using two different charge transfer techniques. This study furthers our understanding of the electronic properties of peptides at the molecular level, which provides an opportunity to fine-tune their molecular orbital energies through suitable structural manipulation.

In order to realise this technology, the fundamental physical and electronic properties of such nanoscopic materials and devices must be fully understood. This thesis reports the successful formation and characterisation {{of a series of}} novel molecular wires on both planar and nanoparticulate surfaces, from which two papers have been published. Formation of these wires was achieved using the reproducible chemical self- assembly method often utilised in bottom-up molecular electronics. After the initial chemisorption of a functional headgroup to a suitable substrate, subsequent layers were chemically reacted by means of an imine bond formation. This allowed multilayer donor-a- bridge-acceptor systems of up to ea. 10. 4 nm in length to be constructed. Not only does this method allow the formation of reasonably complex systems, it also enables functionality to be incorporated into the wire. The assembly characteristics of various wires have been characterised using Quartz Crystal Microbalance and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, {{and in the case of}} those on Ti 02 nanoparticles, with Infrared Spectroscopy. Furthermore, an investigation into the factors affecting the formation of upright, homogeneous mono layers was carried out on a set of related compounds, revealing the importance of molecule-molecule and molecule-substrate interactions. Multiple molecular wires were also characterised with respect to their electrical properties which show symmetrical or asymmetrical current-voltage curves. This was done using Scanning Tunnelling Spectroscopy to obtain current-voltage characteristics, as well as the so called current jump method to measure single molecule current or that of small clusters of molecules.

Other complex 3 - and 4 -point junctions may require other mechanisms. Structural stability as well as local electronic density of states of various nanotube junctions are investigated using a generalized tight-binding molecular dynamics (GDBMD) scheme that incorporates non-orthogonality of the orbitals.

40|$|Synthetic {{peptides}} offer enormous {{potential to}} encode {{the assembly of}} <b>molecular</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>components,</b> provided that the complex range of interactions is distilled into simple design rules. Herein is reported a spectroscopic investigation of aggregation in an extensive series of peptide-perylene imide conjugates designed to interrogate the effect of structural variations. Throughout {{the course of this}} study, the self-assembly and photophysical properties of the compounds are explored to better understand the behavior and application of these materials. Three principal avenues of inquiry are applied: (1) the evaluation of structure-property relationships from a thermodynamic perspective, (2) the examination of peptide chiral effects upon properties and self-assembly, and (3) an application of the understanding gained from rationally designed systems to effectively utilize naturally optimized peptides in bio-organic electronics. By fitting different contributions to temperature-dependent optical absorption spectra, this study quantifies both the thermodynamics and the nature of aggregation for peptides with incrementally varying hydrophobicity, charge density, length, amphiphilic substitution with a hexyl chain, and stereocenter inversion. Coarse effects like hydrophobicity and hexyl substitution are seen to have the greatest impact on binding thermodynamics, which are evaluated separately as enthalpic and entropic contributions. Moreover, significant peptide packing effects are resolved via stereocenter inversion studies, particularly when examining the nature of aggregates formed and the coupling between π-electronic orbitals. Peptide chirality overall is seen to influence the self-assembly of the perylene imide cores into chiral nanofibers, and peptide stereogenic positions, stereochemical configurations, amphiphilic substitution, and perylene core modification are evaluated with respect to chiral assembly. Stereocenters in peptide residue positions proximal to the perylene core (1 - 5 units) are seen to impart helical chirality to the perylene core, while stereocenters in more distal residue positions do not exert a chiral influence. Diastereomers involving stereocenter inversions within the proximal residues consequently manifest spectroscopically as pseudo-enantiomers. Increased side-chain steric demand in the proximal positions gives a similar chiral influence but exhibits diminished Cotton Effect intensity with additional longer wavelength features attributed to interchain excimers. Amphiphilic substitution of a peptide with an alkyl chain disrupts chiral self-assembly, while an amphiphilic structure achieved through the modification of the perylene imide core with a bisester moiety prompts strongly exciton-coupled, chiral, solvent-responsive self-assembly into long nanofilaments. Informed by rationally designed sequences, and capitalizing upon the optimization seen in many natural systems, specific peptide sequences designed by inspection of protein-protein interfaces have been identified and used as tectons in hybrid functional materials. An 8 -mer peptide derived from an interface of the peroxiredoxin family of self-assembling proteins is exploited to encode the assembly of perylene imide-based organic semiconductor building blocks. By augmenting the peptide with additional functionality to trigger aggregation and manipulate the directionality of peptide-semiconductor coupling, a series of hybrid materials based on the natural peptide interface is presented. Using spectroscopic probes, the mode of self-assembly and the electronic coupling between neighboring perylene units is shown to be strongly affected by the number of peptides attached, and by their backbone directionality. The disubstituted material with peptides extending in the N-C direction away from the perylene core exhibits strong coupling and long-range order, which are both attractive properties for electronic device applications. A bio-organic field-effect transistor is fabricated using this material, highlighting the possibilities of exploiting natural peptide tectons to encode self-assembly in other functional materials and devices. These results advance the development of a quantitative framework for establishing structure-function relationships that will underpin the design of self-assembling peptide electronic materials. The results further advance a model for adapting natural peptide sequences resident in β-continuous interfaces as tectons for bio-organic electronics...|$|R
