40|$|In recent years, {{simulation}} modelling {{of software}} processes have has promoted {{as a tool}} to understand, study, control, and manage software development processes. Claims have been made that simulation models are useful and effective at gaining insight into software development processes. However, little has been said about the process of developing simulation models for software engineering problems. Simulation modelling is a young discipline in software engineering. Consequently, many number software process simulation <b>modellers</b> are thought to be novices. The simulation modelling process is believed to have had an effect on the quality of a simulation study. Although there is a body of knowledge available in the general simulation literature to guide and educate novices, the software process simulation modelling literature lacks information for novice software process simulation <b>modellers</b> to understand and adopt a simulation modelling process. This thesis aims to develop a simulation modelling process for novice software process simulation <b>modellers.</b> This thesis reports how the development and evaluation of a simulation modelling process for novice software process simulation <b>modellers.</b> The rapid simulation modelling process (RSMP) is based on an empirical study of the contexts and practices of expert simulation <b>modellers</b> in SPSM and Operational Research (OR). The RSMP is intended to be independent of a particular simulation technique (i. e. system dynamics or discrete event simulation) and guides novice software process simulation <b>modellers</b> through a set of steps that should be undertaken during a simulation study; the RSMP emphasises heavy client contact and provides guidelines for model documentation. The RSMP has been evaluated through controlled experiments with novice software process simulation <b>modellers</b> using system dynamics (SD) modelling. In the future, it will be further evaluated with software process simulation <b>modellers</b> using discrete event simulation. The RSMP has also been evaluated with a panel of expert software process simulation <b>modellers.</b> The main contribution of this study lies in providing novice software process simulation <b>modellers</b> with a simulation modelling process, which embodies real world simulation practice and is intended to be independent of a particular simulation technique...|$|R

The problem area, the scope and the breadth of a problem, simulation software and the size and complexity of the model are some of the contextual factors which may affect a <b>modeller’s</b> practices such as model development, documentation, maintenance and evaluation.

25|$|Various sources can {{contribute}} {{to a range of}} simulation results. The range of the simulation results is defined as model uncertainty. One of the most important sources not possible to quantify is the conceptual model, which is developed and defined by the <b>modeller.</b> Further sources are the parameterization of the model regarding the hydraulic (only when simulating transport) and mineralogical properties. The parameters used for the geochemical simulations can also contribute to model uncertainty. These are the applied thermodynamic database and the parameters for the kinetic minerals dissolution. Differences in the thermodynamic data (i.e. equilibrium constants, parameters for temperature correction, activity equations and coefficients) can result in large uncertainties. Furthermore, the large spans of experimentally derived rate constants for minerals dissolution rate laws can cause large variations in simulation results. Despite this is well-known, uncertainties are not frequently considered when conducting geochemical modelling.|$|E
25|$|Although toy trains were {{historically}} produced to this scale, O gauge's popularity {{across the}} whole of Europe reduced after World War II, and the standard is rarer than in the United States. Modelling in O gauge in fact almost died out in Britain but enjoyed a resurgence in the 1990s as modellers developed a new appreciation for the level of accurate detailing possible in this scale. Some ready to run models are produced in this scale but most are available only as kits for assembly by the <b>modeller</b> or a professional model-builder. O gauge is considered an expensive scale to model in although the necessarily smaller scope of a larger-scaled layout mitigates this to some extent. The two dominant British manufacturers, Bassett-Lowke and Hornby, ceased production of O gauge trains in 1965 and 1969, respectively. However, ACE Trains {{and for a while}} a revived Bassett-Lowke are once again producing tinplate O gauge sets, many of them reproductions of classic Hornby and Bassett-Lowke designs, and Heljan also recently joined the market producing O gauge Diesel locomotives.|$|E
