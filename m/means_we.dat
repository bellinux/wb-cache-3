According to The Nation, Adewole said for the apex policy on health to be achieved, {{we need to work}} together and working together <b>means</b> <b>we</b> can make a huge difference. We have been described as a generation that enjoyed better health when we were young than now and our aim is to bring back the health care system we enjoyed when we were young.|$|E

The deontological argument {{relies on the}} belief that we should treat others as we would like to be treated. If someone was suffering from a terminal illness and they were likely to die shortly, under deontological assumptions research could not be done on them even if it meant saving the lives of millions.|$|E
25|$|Process variations: With MOSFETs {{becoming}} smaller, {{the number}} of atoms in the silicon that produce many of the transistor's properties is becoming fewer, {{with the result that}} control of dopant numbers and placement is more erratic. During chip manufacturing, random process variations affect all transistor dimensions: length, width, junction depths, oxide thickness etc., and become a greater percentage of overall transistor size as the transistor shrinks. The transistor characteristics become less certain, more statistical. The random nature of manufacture <b>means</b> <b>we</b> do not know which particular example MOSFETs actually will end up in a particular instance of the circuit. This uncertainty forces a less optimal design because the design must work for a great variety of possible component MOSFETs. See process variation, design for manufacturability, reliability engineering, and statistical process control.|$|E

Rehab really just <b>means</b> <b>we</b> have to get over the guy. So we talk about checking ourselves into rehab, meaning we have to get over him. And we compare the guy to a disease or an addiction." [...] Watson further called the song a [...] "lovesick ballad".|$|E

Harrison concluded his review while commenting on [...] "Callie and Her Sister": [...] "This sort of episode {{is still in its}} early stages, but I don't begrudge Ugly Americans the training wheels if it <b>means</b> <b>we</b> get to better know the people and creatures of the fascinating animated world.

As you worked on it, you really got the feeling that Rome was {{going to look like}} something we had never seen on TV before, so our vfx approach very much wanted to respect that." [...] Madigan attempted to seamlessly mesh the visual effects with the physical sets and depend less on CGI.

[...] He insisted the draws did not reflect on his team's {{negative}} tactics, but [...] "because of other teams coming back into the game". On the issue of Patrick Vieira's anticipated move to Real Madrid, Wenger told reporters the player would remain at Arsenal. Wenger acknowledged his team were short on experience {{as a result of}} selling players and missing Vieira, Sol Campbell and Thierry Henry, who all were injured. He considered this to be a disadvantage, but argued [...] "...the younger ones have to be given a chance. They all have to take some responsibility." ...|$|E

Freedom of speech <b>means</b> <b>we</b> need to allow all to speak - including those we strongly disagree with. I am of the opinion that the Church of Scientology is a criminal organisation and a cult which is designed by its delusional founder to abuse people.

500|$|In his 2007 State of the Union Address, Bush renewed {{his pledge}} {{to work toward}} diminished {{reliance}} on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production. Amid high gasoline prices in 2008, Bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling. However, the move was largely symbolic because {{there was still a}} federal law banning offshore drilling. Bush said, [...] "This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress." [...] Bush had said in June 2008, [...] "In the long run, the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies. My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells... In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil. And that <b>means</b> <b>we</b> need to increase supply, especially here at home. So my administration has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2016, Mappa Producer Masao Maruyama Said in an interview: [...] "For 4~5 years, I kept {{searching for}} a {{suitable}} director to complete Kon's work. Before his death, the storyboard and script, even part of the keyframe film was already completed. Then I thought, even if someone can mimic Kon's work, {{it would still be}} clear that it's only an imitation. For example, if Mamoru Hosoda took the director's position, the completed Dreaming Machine would still be a good piece of work. However, that would make it Hosoda's movie, not Kon's. Dreaming Machine should be Kon's movie, him and only him, not someone else's. That <b>means</b> <b>we</b> cannot and should not [...] "compromise" [...] only to finish it. I spent years to finally reach this hard conclusion. Instead, we should take only Kon's [...] "original concept", and let somebody turn it into a feature film. By doing so, the completed piece could 100% be that person's work, and I'm OK with that. I also considered about doing a documentary of Kon." ...|$|E

[...] Empathy involves [...] "emptying the mind and listening with our whole being." [...] NVC suggests that however the other person expresses themselves, we focus on listening for the underlying observations, feelings, needs, and requests. It is suggested that it can be useful to reflect a paraphrase of what another person has said, highlighting the NVC components implicit in their message, such as the feelings and needs you guess they may be expressing.|$|E
500|$|As the wet {{season ended}} in early 1852, Seacole joined other traders in Cruces in packing up {{to move to}} Gorgona. She records a white American giving a speech at a leaving dinner in which he wished that [...] "God bless the best yaller woman he ever made" [...] and asked the {{listeners}} to join with him in rejoicing that [...] "she's so many shades removed from being entirely black". He {{went on to say}} that [...] "if we could bleach her by any <b>means</b> <b>we</b> would and thus make her acceptable in any company as she deserves to be". Seacole replied firmly that she did not [...] "appreciate your friend's kind wishes with respect to my complexion. If it had been as dark as any nigger's, I should have been just as happy and just as useful, and as much respected by those whose respect I value." [...] She declined the offer of [...] "bleaching" [...] and drank [...] "to you and the general reformation of American manners". Salih notes the use of American pidgin, against Seacole's clear English, as representational of a supposed white moral and intellectual superiority. Seacole also comments on the positions of responsibility taken on by escaped American slaves in Panama, as well as in the priesthood, the army, and public offices, commenting that [...] "it is wonderful to see how freedom and equality elevate men". She also records an antipathy between Panamanians and Americans, which she attributes in part to the fact that so many of the former had once been slaves of the latter.|$|E
500|$|... "Wet Hot Demonic Summer" [...] {{was written}} by Daniel Powell and {{directed}} by Aaron Augenblick. Series creator Devin Clark said that they planned on giving it a summer theme since they knew it would air in the summer. Clark further elaborated on the decision to incorporate summer and Harry Potter themes into the episode, stating: [...] "We went, 'alright, those are two little nuggets of ideas we can incorporate into that.' We can't be as relevant to pop culture as some other shows, but it just <b>means</b> <b>we</b> {{have a little more}} of a challenge of making jokes that are a little more evergreen and poking fun of the genre in a much broader spectrum." [...] Screenwriter Powell explained that it is difficult for the series to do [...] "topical stuff" [...] as it takes up to nine months to complete an episode, but they were {{aware of the fact that}} the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 would premiere shortly after the episode was set to air. [...] "So it would seem like we were hyper-topical, even though we had a good nine months advance notice", he said. Powell said that they included famous wizards from many other sources, including The Lord of the Rings and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. In an interview with Charles Webb of MTV, Clark elaborated: [...] "We make it a hodgepodge of the wizard references and obviously the main one is, and the most prominent one and the one that's most relevant to pop culture is the Harry Potter spoof that we've thrown in there.|$|E
