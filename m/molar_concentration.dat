40|$|In {{this present}} study, {{wurtzite}} CZTS nanocrystals {{have been prepared}} by a sol–gel route associated to spin coating for different <b>molar</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the precursor solution.

25|$|The mole is {{a unit of}} {{measurement}} that denotes an amount of substance (also called chemical amount).

2500|$|There {{are many}} ways to define the {{proportionality}} constant of Henry's law, which can be subdivided into two fundamental types: One possibility is to put the aqueous phase into the numerator and the gas phase into the denominator ("aq/gas"). This results in the Henry's law solubility constant [...] Its value increases with increased solubility. Alternatively, numerator and denominator can be switched ("gas/aq"), which results in the Henry's law volatility constant [...] The value of [...] decreases with increased solubility. There are several variants of both fundamental types. This results from the multiplicity of quantities that can be chosen to describe the composition of the two phases. Typical choices for the aqueous phase are <b>molar</b> <b>concentration</b> (...) , molality (...) , and molar mixing ratio (...) [...] For the gas phase, <b>molar</b> <b>concentration</b> (...) and partial pressure (...) are often used.
