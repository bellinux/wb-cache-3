5|$|Transverse ridges {{between the}} cusps, {{as seen in}} Ferugliotherium, are known in only one multituberculate, Essonodon, but the ridge pattern in Essonodon is <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>and</b> the animal lacks the {{prominent}} furrows of Ferugliotherium and differs in numerous other features. On the other hand, overall patterns of cusps and ridges are essentially similar among Ferugliotherium, Gondwanatherium, and Sudamerica, indicating that the three are closely related.|$|E
5|$|Torpedo {{capability}} {{was always}} considered paramount. The lack of suitable aircraft and shortage {{of the weapon}} itself resulted in the strike arm of Coastal Command being severely handicapped. As late as 10 December 1941 the torpedo resources {{were given to the}} Fleet Air Arm (FAA) which would receive 75 percent of all torpedoes. Torpedoes were sensitive and highly costly in production terms. The weather conditions off enemy coasts made their use <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>and</b> the depth of the water was considered too shallow. It was also uneconomical to use the weapon against low-tonnage shipping, Coastal Command's main target. Aside from that, the Beaufort torpedo-bomber was being posted overseas from August 1941 onwards.|$|E

5|$|During {{the later}} stages of World War II, the entire Cold War, {{and to a}} lesser extent afterwards, {{uranium-235}} has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons. Initially, two major types of fission bombs were built: a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses plutonium-239 derived from uranium-238. Later, a much <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>and</b> far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb (thermonuclear weapon) was built, that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion. Such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile (unenriched) uranium case, and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process.|$|E
5|$|In his smaller poetic works, Johnson {{relied on}} short lines and filled {{his work with}} a feeling of empathy, which {{possibly}} influenced Housman's poetic style. In London, his first imitation of Juvenal, Johnson uses the poetic form to express his political opinion and, as befits a young writer, approaches the topic in a playful and almost joyous manner. However, his second imitation, The Vanity of Human Wishes, is completely different; the language remains simple, but the poem is <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>and</b> difficult to read because Johnson is trying to describe complex Christian ethics. These Christian values are not unique to the poem, but contain views expressed in most of Johnson's works. In particular, Johnson emphasises God's infinite love and shows that happiness can be attained through virtuous action.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with a free}} plot {{of land in the}} United Kingdom and {{few hundred}} {{thousand}} pounds, the player must build a profitable amusement park. Money is spent on building rides, shops, and staff, and earned through sale of entry tickets, merchandise, and refreshments. Shops available include those selling foodstuff (such as ice creams) or soft drinks, and games such as coconut shies and arcades. Their attributes can be customised, which may affect customers' behaviour: for example, affecting the flavour of foods (e.g. by altering the amount of sugar and ice cream contains) may affect customers' enticements to return. Facilities such as toilets, and items that enhance the park's scenery (such as trees and fountains) can be purchased. Over thirty attractions, ranging in complexity from the bouncy castle and tree house to <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>and</b> expensive rides such as the roller coaster and Ferris wheel are available. Also available as rides are shows (called 'acts') with themes such as clowns and mediaeval. Certain rides, such as roller coasters, require a track to be laid out. The ride complement varies between platforms: for example, the PlayStation version is missing the mediaeval and dolphin shows. Rides require regular maintenance: if neglected for too long they will explode. Depending on the platform, it is possible to tour the park or the rides.|$|E

25|$|Cases of SBO {{related to}} cancer are <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>and</b> require {{additional}} intervention {{to address the}} malignancy, recurrence, and metastasis, and thus are associated with poorer prognosis.|$|E
25|$|Experienced chemists who {{supported}} Stahl's phlogiston theory attempted {{to respond to}} the challenges suggested by Lavoisier and the newer chemists. In doing so, phlogiston theory became <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>and</b> assumed too much, contributing to the overall demise of the theory.|$|E
25|$|As such, the {{traditional}} statistical inference machinery {{will not work}} with these <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> models, <b>and</b> in this case, {{it is common to}} instead use a forward simulation-based approach.|$|R

30|$|However the Irish case is (as {{is likely}} {{the case in}} many {{northern}} European countries) <b>more</b> <b>complicated.</b> This {{is due to the}} fact that there are more instruments (See Appendix 1) with <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> rules <b>and</b> with overlapping values between instruments.|$|R
25|$|Numbers {{can count}} (3nbsp&apples), order (the 3rdnbsp&apple), or measure (3.5nbsp&feet high); as {{the history of}} {{mathematics}} has progressed from counting on our fingers to modelling quantum mechanics, multiplication has been generalized to <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>and</b> abstract types of numbers, and to {{things that are not}} numbers (such as matrices) or do not look much like numbers (such as quaternions).|$|E
25|$|The war however {{was getting}} <b>more</b> <b>complicated,</b> <b>and</b> General Campo {{had to leave}} to Barranquilla to buy weapons and bring {{reinforcements}} passing on the governorship to Alejandro Orillac as acting governor. Although General Campo’s leave cause an intensification of the rebel forces, the war {{came to an end}} in 1902, cementing the way for the separation of Panama from Colombia.|$|E
25|$|Some demand valves use a small, {{sensitive}} {{pilot valve}} {{to control the}} opening of the main valve. The Poseidon Jetstream and Xstream and Oceanic Omega second stages are examples of this technology. They can produce very high flow rates for a small pressure differential, and particularly for a relatively small cracking pressure. They are generally <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>and</b> expensive to service.|$|E

25|$|In March 1892, Milan renounced all {{his rights}} {{and even his}} Serbian nationality. The {{situation}} altered dramatically, however, after the young Alexander I had effected his coup d'etat and taken government {{into his own hands}} in April 1893. Serbian politics began to grow <b>more</b> <b>complicated,</b> <b>and</b> Russian influence was rife. In January 1894, Milan suddenly appeared in Belgrade, and his son gladly welcomed his experience and advice.|$|E
25|$|The {{removal of}} the chelev and the gid hanasheh, called nikkur, is {{considered}} complicated and tedious, and hence labor-intensive, and even more specialized training is necessary to perform the act properly. While the small amounts of chelev in the front half of the animal are relatively easy to remove, the back half of the animal is far <b>more</b> <b>complicated,</b> <b>and</b> it is where the sciatic nerve is located.|$|E
25|$|Diesel–hydraulic {{locomotives}} {{are less}} efficient than diesel–electrics. The first-generation BR diesel hydraulics {{were significantly less}} efficient (c. 65%) than diesel electrics (c. 80%) — moreover initial versions were found in many countries to be mechanically <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>and</b> more likely to break down. Hydraulic transmission for locomotives was developed in Germany. There is still debate over {{the relative merits of}} hydraulic vs. electrical transmission systems: advantages claimed for hydraulic systems include lower weight, high reliability, and lower capital cost.|$|E

25|$|At most {{points of}} the Riemann sphere, this {{transformation}} is a local homeomorphism: it maps a small disk centered {{at any point in}} a one-to-one way into another disk. However, at certain critical points, the mapping is <b>more</b> <b>complicated,</b> <b>and</b> maps a disk centered at the point in a k-to-one way onto its image. The number k is known as the degree of the critical point and the transformed image of a critical point is known as a critical value.|$|E
25|$|Knee replacement, {{also known}} as knee arthroplasty, is a {{surgical}} procedure to replace the weight-bearing surfaces of the knee joint to relieve pain and disability. It is most commonly performed for osteoarthritis, and also for other knee diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. In patients with severe deformity from advanced rheumatoid arthritis, trauma, or long-standing osteoarthritis, the surgery may be <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>and</b> carry higher risk. Osteoporosis does not typically cause knee pain, deformity, or inflammation {{and is not a}} reason to perform knee replacement.|$|E
25|$|Drum brakes provide {{consistent}} braking in wet or dirty conditions {{since the}} mechanism is fully enclosed. They are usually heavier, <b>more</b> <b>complicated,</b> <b>and</b> often weaker than rim brakes, but they require less maintenance. Drum brakes do not adapt well to quick release axle fastening, and removing a drum brake wheel requires the operator to disconnect the brake cable {{as well as}} the axle. They also require a torque arm which must be anchored to the frame or fork of the bicycle, and not all bicycles are constructed to accommodate such fastenings or tolerate their applied forces.|$|E
50|$|Triangulation {{is useful}} in {{determining}} the properties of a topological space. For example, one can compute homology and cohomology groups of a triangulated space using simplicial homology and cohomology theories instead of <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> homology <b>and</b> cohomology theories.|$|R
