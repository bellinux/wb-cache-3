In general, expression of prokaryotic operons leads to the generation of polycistronic mRNAs, while eukaryotic operons lead to <b>monocistronic</b> mRNAs.|$|E
25|$|In genetics, an operon is a {{functioning}} unit of genomic DNA containing {{a cluster of}} genes {{under the control of}} a single promoter. The genes are transcribed together into an mRNA strand and either translated together in the cytoplasm, or undergo trans-splicing to create <b>monocistronic</b> mRNAs that are translated separately, i.e. several strands of mRNA that each encode a single gene product. The result of this is that the genes contained in the operon are either expressed together or not at all. Several genes must be co-transcribed to define an operon.|$|E
2500|$|The {{adenovirus}} {{life cycle}} is separated by the DNA replication process into two phases: an early and a late phase. In both phases, a primary transcript [...] that is alternatively spliced to generate <b>monocistronic</b> mRNAs {{compatible with the}} host’s ribosome is generated, allowing for the products to be translated.|$|E
5000|$|Multicistronic {{message is}} an archaic term for Polycistronic. <b>Monocistronic,</b> bicistronic and tricistronic {{are also used}} to {{describe}} mRNA with single, double and triple coding areas (exons).|$|E

50|$|The genes ZFP91 and CNTF are {{adjacent}} on chromosome 11. In {{addition to}} a <b>monocistronic</b> transcript from each locus, a co-transcribed transcript also exists. The co-transcribed mRNA encodes an isoform of ZFP91 but {{does not appear to}} encode a CNTF protein.|$|E
50|$|For example, an operon is {{a stretch}} of DNA that is {{transcribed}} to create a contiguous segment of RNA, but contains more than one cistron / gene. The operon {{is said to be}} polycistronic, whereas ordinary genes are said to be <b>monocistronic.</b>|$|E
50|$|Spliced leader {{sequences}} {{are short}} sequences of non coding RNA, not found within a gene itself, that {{are attached to}} the 5’ end of all, or a portion of, mRNAs transcribed in an organism. They have been found in several species to be responsible for separating polycistronic transcripts into single gene mRNAs, and in others to splice onto <b>monocistronic</b> transcripts. The major role of trans-splicing on <b>monocistronic</b> transcripts is largely unknown. It has been proposed that they may act as an independent promoter that aids in tissue specific expression of independent protein isoforms. Spliced leaders have been seen in trypanosomatids, Euglena, flatworms, Caenorhabditis. Some species contain only one spliced leader sequence found on all mRNAs. In C. elegans two are seen and are labeled SL1 and SL2.|$|E

50|$|Trans-splicing is used {{by certain}} {{microbial}} organisms, notably protozoa of the Kinetoplastae class to express genes. In these organisms, a capped splice leader RNA is transcribed; simultaneously, genes are transcribed in long polycistrons. The capped splice leader is trans-spliced onto each gene to generate <b>monocistronic</b> capped and polyadenylated transcripts.|$|E
50|$|In viruses with nonsegmented genomes, {{the first}} step of {{replication}} is transcription of the negative strand by RdRp to form various <b>monocistronic</b> mRNA that code for individual viral proteins. A positive strand copy is formed to serve as template for the production of the negative genome. This replication takes place in the cytoplasm.|$|E

50|$|The {{large and}} small {{subunits}} of molybdopterin synthase are both encoded from the MOCS2 gene by overlapping open reading frames. The proteins were initially thought to be encoded from a bicistronic transcript. They are now thought to be encoded from <b>monocistronic</b> transcripts. Alternatively spliced transcripts have been found for this locus that encode the {{large and small}} subunits.|$|E
5000|$|Viruses {{containing}} nonsegmented genomes {{for which}} {{the first step in}} replication is transcription from the (-)-stranded genome by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to yield <b>monocistronic</b> mRNAs that code for the various viral proteins.

50|$|Like most viruses with RNA genomes, {{double-stranded}} RNA viruses do {{not rely}} on host polymerases for replication {{to the extent that}} viruses with DNA genomes do. Double-stranded RNA viruses are not as well-studied as other classes. This class includes two major families, the Reoviridae and Birnaviridae. Replication is <b>monocistronic</b> and includes individual, segmented genomes, meaning that each of the genes codes for only one protein, unlike other viruses, which exhibit more complex translation.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with most}} RNA viruses, this class {{replicates}} in the [...] "Core" [...] capsid {{that is in}} cytoplasm, not having to use the host replication polymerases to as much a degree as DNA viruses.

50|$|This gene encodes {{a member}} of the bone {{morphogenetic}} protein (BMP) family and the TGF-beta superfamily. This group of proteins is characterized by a polybasic proteolytic processing site that is cleaved to produce a mature protein containing seven conserved cysteine residues. Members of this family are regulators of cell growth and differentiation in both embryonic and adult tissues. Studies in yeast suggest that the encoded protein is involved in aging. This protein is transcribed from a <b>monocistronic</b> mRNA as well as a bicistronic mRNA, which also encodes growth differentiation factor 1.|$|E
50|$|Coronaviruses {{also have}} a protein known as a {{replicase}} encoded in its genome which allows the RNA viral genome to be transcribed into new RNA copies using the host cell's machinery. The replicase is the first protein to be made; once the gene encoding the replicase is translated, the translation is stopped by a stop codon. This {{is known as a}} nested transcript. When the mRNA transcript only encodes one gene, it is <b>monocistronic.</b> A coronavirus non-structural protein provides extra fidelity to replication because it confers a proofreading function, which is lacking in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzymes alone.|$|E
50|$|Chandipura {{virus is}} an enveloped RNA virus with an {{approximate}} genome length of ~11 kb. Viral genome codes for five polypeptides, namely, Nucleocapsid protein N, Phosphoprotein P, Matrix protein M, Glycoprotein G and Large protein L in five <b>monocistronic</b> mRNAs. N protein encapsidates genome RNA into a nuclease-resistant form to protect in from cellular RNAse function. L and P protein together forms viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase; where catalytic functions for RNA polymerization, Capping and Poly-A polymerase resides within the L protein and P {{acts as a}} transcriptional activator. Matrix protein glues the encapsidated genome RNA, also known as nucleocapsid, with the outer membrane envelop. G protein spikes out of the membrane and acts as a major antigenic determinant.|$|E
50|$|An mRNA {{molecule}} {{is said to}} be <b>monocistronic</b> when {{it contains}} the genetic information to translate only a single protein chain (polypeptide). This is the case for most of the eukaryotic mRNAs. On the other hand, polycistronic mRNA carries several open reading frames (ORFs), each of which is translated into a polypeptide. These polypeptides usually have a related function (they often are the subunits composing a final complex protein) and their coding sequence is grouped and regulated together in a regulatory region, containing a promoter and an operator. Most of the mRNA found in bacteria and archaea is polycistronic, as is the human mitochondrial genome. Dicistronic or bicistronic mRNA encodes only two proteins.|$|E
50|$|LVX {{does not}} have a known vector, but it most likely spreads and enters the cell through {{mechanical}} inoculation by insects. The replication of LVX, like other ssRNA(+) viruses, occurs in the cytoplasm of cells. Once the virus enters into the host cell, the virus is uncoated and releases the viral genome RNA into the cytoplasm. The viral <b>monocistronic</b> RNA is then translated into RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, encoded by the 5’-proximal ORF. The replication of LVX occurs in viral factories which are organized by the protein TGBp1. TGBp1 works to rearrange the actin and endomembranes of the host and creates an assembly of helical arrangements. These helical structures are surrounded by the host endomembranes, which create a region where the virus can replicate more efficiently.|$|E
50|$|Being acellular, viruses such as Ebola do not {{replicate}} {{through any}} type of cell division; rather, they {{use a combination of}} host- and virally encoded enzymes, alongside host cell structures, to produce multiple copies of themselves. These then self-assemble into viral macromolecular structures in the host cell. The virus completes a set of steps when infecting each individual cell.The virus begins its attack by attaching to host receptors through the glycoprotein (GP) surface peplomer and is endocytosed into macropinosomes in the host cell. To penetrate the cell, the viral membrane fuses with vesicle membrane, and the nucleocapsid is released into the cytoplasm. Encapsidated, negative-sense genomic ssRNA is used as a template for the synthesis (3'-5') of polyadenylated, <b>monocistronic</b> mRNAs and, using the host cell's ribosomes, tRNA molecules, etc., the mRNA is translated into individual viral proteins.|$|E
50|$|In bacteria, the USP genes can be {{regulated}} by sigma factors within RNA polymerases. This includes sigma factor σ70 which through binding {{to a single}} promoter region, upregulates the transcription of UspA in bacteria. The genes are regulated in a <b>monocistronic</b> fashion.Additionally, UspA, UspC, UspD and UspE are over induced during stationary phase through regulation of RecA. RecA {{is known for its}} involvement in the repair of DNA via homologous recombination following damage. Consequently, the four Usp domain genes are thought to be mediating the management or protection of DNA. Whatever the mechanism exhibited by the proteins, one thing which can be concluded is that USP domains are crucial for survival of many bacterial species. Gomes et al. found that UspA deletions in Listeria severely impaired survival as well as listeria’s stress response by in vitro and in vivo.|$|E
50|$|This gene encodes {{a highly}} basic protein {{localized}} to the nucleus. The evolutionarily constrained {{open reading frame}} is found on a bicistronic transcript which has a downstream ORF encoding the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N. The upstream coding region utilizes the first three exons of the transcript, a region that {{has been identified as}} an imprinting center. Multiple transcription initiation sites have been identified and extensive alternative splicing occurs in the 5' untranslated region but the full-length nature of these transcripts has not been determined. An alternate exon has been identified that substitutes for exon 4 and leads to a truncated, <b>monocistronic</b> transcript. Alternative splicing or deletion caused by a translocation event in the 5' untranslated region or coding region of this gene leads to Angelman syndrome or Prader-Willi syndrome due to parental imprint switch failure. The function of this protein is not yet known.|$|E
50|$|An operon is {{the set of}} one {{or several}} genes and their {{associated}} regulatory elements, which are transcribed as a single unit. The classical definition {{is that of a}} group of two or more genes transcribed as a polycistronic unit. For database purposes, we extend the definition to include the possibility of operons with only one gene. An operon is, therefore, a group of one or more contiguous genes transcribed in the same direction. Please note that given this definition, an operon must contain a promoter upstream of all genes and a terminator downstream. It is also relatively common to find operons with several promoters, some of them internally located, thus transcribing a partial group of genes. In all cases so far, one gene belongs to only one operon.The graphic display of an operon contains all the genes of its different transcription units, as well as all the regulatory elements involved in the transcription and regulation of those TUs. The genome browser shows genes and operons, accepting also <b>monocistronic</b> operons.|$|E
50|$|Ribonomics is {{the study}} of ribonucleic acids (RNAs) {{associated}} with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). The term was introduced by Robert Cedergren and colleagues who used a bioinformatic search tool to discover novel ribozymes and RNA motifs originally found in HIV.Ribonomics, like genomics or proteomics, is the large-scale, high-throughput approach to identifying subsets of RNAs by their association with proteins in cells. Since many messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are linked with multiple processes, this technique offers a facile mechanism to study the relationship of various intracellular systems.Prokaryotes co-regulate genes common to cellular processes via a polycistronic operon. Since eukaryotic transcription produces mRNA encoding proteins in a <b>monocistronic</b> fashion, many gene products must be concomitantly expressed (see gene expression) and translated in a timed fashion. RBPs are thought to be the molecules which physically and biochemically organize these messages to different cellular locales where they may be translated, degraded or stored. The study of transcripts associated with RBPs is therefore thought to be important in eukaryotes as a mechanism for coordinated gene regulation. The likely biochemical processes which account for this regulation are the expedited/delayed degradation of RNA. In addition to the influence on RNA half-life, translation rates are also thought to be altered by RNA-protein interactions.The Drosphila ELAV family, the Puf family in yeast, and the human La, Ro, and FMR proteins are known examples of RBPs, showing the diverse species and processes with which post-transcriptional gene regulation is associated.|$|E
5000|$|Replication of many rhabdoviruses {{occurs in}} the cytoplasm, {{although}} several of the plant infecting viruses replicate in the nucleus.. In order for replication, both the L and P protein must be expressed to regulate transcription. The L protein {{have a lot of}} enzymatic actiivites such as RNA replication, capping mRNAs phospholorylation of P. L protein gives feature in about replication in cytopolasm. Transcription results in five <b>monocistronic</b> mRNAs being produced because the intergenic sequences act as both termination and promoter sequences for adjacent genes. This type of transcription mechanism is explained by stop-start model( [...] stuttering transcription). Owing to stop-start model, the large amounts of the structural proteins are produced. According to this model, the virus-associated RNA polymerase starts firstly the synthesis of leader RNA and then the five mRNA which will produce N,P,M,G,L proteins, respectively. After the leader RNA was produced, the polymerase enzyme reinitiates virion transcription on N gene and proceeds its synthesis until it ends 3′ end of the chain.Then, the synthesis of P mRNAs are made by same enzyme with new starter sinyal. These steps continue until the enzyme arrives the end of the L gene. During transcription process, the polymerase enzyme may leave the template at any point and then bound just at the 3′ end of the genome RNA to start mRNA synthesis again. This process will results concentration gradient of the amount of mRNA based on its place and its range from the 3′ end. In the circumstances, the amounts of mRNA species change and will be produced N>P>M>G>L proteins. During their synthesis the mRNAs are processed to introduce a 5' cap and a 3’ polyadenylated tail to each of the molecules [...]This structure is homologous to cellular mRNAs and can thus be translated by cellular ribosomes to produce both structural and non-structural proteins.|$|E
40|$|Most plastid {{genes are}} part of operons and {{expressed}} as polycistronic mRNAs. Many primary polycistronic transcripts undergo post-transcriptional processing in <b>monocistronic</b> or oligocistronic units. At least some polycistronic transcripts are not translatable, and endonucleolytic processing may therefore be a prerequisite for translation to occur. As the requirements for intercistronic mRNA processing into stable <b>monocistronic</b> transcript are not well understood, we have sought to define minimum sequence elements that trigger processing and thus are capable of generating stable translatable <b>monocistronic</b> mRNAs. We describe here the in vivo identification of a small intercistronic expression element that mediates intercistronic cleavage into stable <b>monocistronic</b> transcripts. Separation of foreign genes by this element facilitates transgene stacking in operons, and thus will help to expand the range of applications of transplastomic technology...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of {{bacteriophage}} T 4 gene 32 transcription {{has revealed}} {{a multiplicity of}} mRNAs. In plasmids, gene 32 is expressed primarily from a strong promoter that is shut off after phage infection. In a wild-type infection, gene 32 is initially transcribed from prereplicative polycistronic and <b>monocistronic</b> promoters; subsequently, a <b>monocistronic</b> late mRNA predominates. This transcript, {{as well as a}} post-transcriptionally processed product of the earlier mRNA, can be stable. The eventual degradation of the stable mRNAs is temporally regulated by the phage. Finally, the transcription termination region of gene 32 can function as an antisense promoter both in vitro and in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Essentially all {{eukaryotic}} cellular mRNAs are <b>monocistronic,</b> and {{are usually}} transcribed individually. Two tandemly arranged Drosophila genes, alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) and Adh-related (Adhr), are transcribed as a dicistronic transcript. From transcripts initiated from the Adh promoter, two classes of mRNA are accumulated, one is <b>monocistronic</b> and encodes Adh alone, the other is dicistronic and includes the open reading frames of both Adh and Adhr. The dicistronic transcript is found in polysomes and the Adhr protein product is detected by antibody staining. We present evidence that the accumulation of the dicistronic mRNA is controlled {{at the level of}} the 3 ' end processing...|$|E
40|$|X-chromosome linked {{inhibitor}} of apoptosis (XIAP) mRNA {{has been}} proposed to bear a stress-activated internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that stimulates translation under conditions that inhibit cap-dependent initiation. However, several reports have indicated that the strong activity of the XIAP IRES in certain bicistronic reporter assay systems stems from production of unintended <b>monocistronic</b> transcripts through splicing or cryptic promoter activity. Here we extend these findings by providing evidence that the XIAP IRES similarly provokes the production of <b>monocistronic</b> mRNA encompassing the 3 ′ cistron in the βgal/CAT bicistronic reporter plasmid that was originally used to identify and characterize this putative IRES, through cryptic promoter activity...|$|E
