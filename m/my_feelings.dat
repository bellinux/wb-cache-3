She said after her first year of writing: [...] "I'm a private person and never thought that I could express <b>my</b> <b>feelings.</b> But strangely enough, {{whenever}} I sat down to write this column, my inner most thoughts came to the fore." [...] In March 2009, she met several readers who had submitted feedback on her weekly column.|$|E
500|$|Rock 'n' Roll Circus is a {{rock music}} album which {{includes}} numerous musical elements of electropop, J-pop, rock, pop ballad, and dance music. In {{an interview with}} Japanese magazine S Cawaii, Hamasaki said about the sound of Rock 'n' Roll Circus; [...] "... basically has a feeling of [...] "back-to-basics." [...] A feeling of Ayumi Hamasaki, and less of adventure. More digging down into the foundation. Which isn't to say I'm taking a step backward. It's about expressing <b>my</b> <b>feelings</b> on things I've always liked, but as the person I am now." ...|$|E
500|$|Lee Greenwood {{has stated}} that he wrote the song [...] "God Bless the USA" [...] in {{response}} to his feelings about the shooting down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007.

[...] "The words seemed to flow naturally from the music, and came out with total honesty. They were an expression of <b>my</b> <b>feelings</b> of pride. To me, America seemed just like a rookery, a place where {{we have a chance to}} grow, unmolested and free." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite the EBU {{allowing}} {{only the}} flags of full UN {{member states to}} be displayed at the 2016 contest, during the first semi-final on 10 May 2016, the Armenian representative Iveta Mukuchyan was seen holding the flag of Nagorno-Karabakh, sparking backlash from the Azeri press. During a press conference following the semi-final, Mukuchyan responded to the incident by stating that [...] "You don't have to forget that I am representing my country in my heart, my thoughts, <b>my</b> <b>feelings,</b> and all my emotions. My thoughts are with my motherland, and what I want to spread is peace on borders. I wrote 'LoveWave' because {{this was going on}} inside of me." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{overview}} of the third season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Talitha Cumi" [...] was rated an [...] "A–". The review called the episode a [...] "frustratingly provocative cliff-hanger", calling the interrogation scene of Jeremiah Smith [...] "a tour de force". Chris Carter has also noted that the interrogation 'is really a summation of <b>my</b> <b>feelings</b> about science ... that it has definitely usurped religion and can explain everything now". Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen rated the episode an [...] "A", praising its cliffhanger ending and [...] "good storytelling". Handlen felt that the episode dealt with themes familiar to the series, but in a manner which did not appear repetitive; and again noted Jeremiah Smith's confrontation with The Smoking Man as a highlight.|$|E
500|$|Jacques {{began an}} affair in 1962 with her driver, John Schofield, {{who gave her}} the {{attention}} and support that Le Mesurier did not. When Jacques decided to move Schofield into the family home, Le Mesurier moved into a separate room and tried to repair the marriage. He later commented about this period: [...] "I could have walked out, but, whatever <b>my</b> <b>feelings,</b> I loved Hattie and the children and I was certain—I had to be certain—that we could repair the damage". The affair caused a downturn in his health; he collapsed on holiday in Tangier in 1963 and was hospitalised in Gibraltar. He returned to London to find the situation between his wife and her lover was unchanged, which caused a relapse.|$|E

500|$|She {{started to}} work with Mirwais Ahmadzaï {{with whom she had}} {{previously}} developed her eighth album Music (2000). However, that collaboration did not suit Madonna's musical direction. According to Madonna, [...] " [...] Mirwais is also very political, seriously cerebral and intellectual. All we did was sit around, talking politics all the time. So, that couldn't help but find its way into the music. I think there's an angry aspect to the music that directly reflects <b>my</b> <b>feelings</b> at the time." [...] Hence after recording tracks with Mirwais, Madonna decided to stop the project and start fresh. It was then that she turned to Stuart Price who had served as musical director on her two previous concert tours and co-wrote one song on American Life.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked if}} Darwinism informs his {{everyday}} apprehension of life, Dawkins says, [...] "in one way it does. My eyes are constantly wide {{open to the}} extraordinary fact of existence. Not just human existence but the existence of life and how this breathtakingly powerful process, which is natural selection, has managed to take the very simple facts of physics and chemistry and build them up to redwood trees and humans. That's never far from my thoughts, that sense of amazement. On the other hand I certainly don't allow Darwinism to influence <b>my</b> <b>feelings</b> about human social life," [...] implying that he feels that individual human beings can {{opt out of the}} survival machine of Darwinism since they are freed by the consciousness of self.|$|E
500|$|Weezer {{turned down}} a video {{treatment}} for lead single [...] "El Scorcho" [...] proposed by Spike Jonze, who had previously helped raise the band's status with his videos for [...] "Undone – The Sweater Song" [...] and [...] "Buddy Holly". Cuomo explained: [...] "I really don't want the songs to come across untainted this time around... I really want to communicate <b>my</b> <b>feelings</b> directly and because I was so careful in writing that way. I'd hate for the video to kinda misrepresent the song, or exaggerate certain aspects." [...] The final video featured the band playing in an assembly hall in Los Angeles, surrounded by light fixtures flashing {{in time to the}} music. Mark Romanek, the video's director, quit after numerous arguments with Cuomo, leaving Cuomo to edit the video himself. The video debuted on MTV's 120 Minutes and received moderate airplay.|$|E

500|$|Initial first-run {{pressings}} of {{the international}} version of the Come On Over album during March 1998 featured White on the song, while subsequent pressings began featuring the song as a solo recording. [...] In early 1998, Mercury executives were informed that White {{would be unable to}} promote the song alongside Twain; therefore, Twain had to return to the studio to re-record White's parts on her own. According to White's spokesman at Asylum Records, [...] "We've certainly heard knocking on our door about [...] "From This Moment On" [...] being too contemporary for Bryan's sake; therefore, it is fine if they {{want to go to the}} Top 40 without him." [...] White later claimed that he had no hard feelings towards Twain for him being excluded from the international version of the song, stating, [...] "They're releasing this song as a pop record, and I'm not a pop artist, so <b>my</b> <b>feelings</b> aren't hurt." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Lauryn Hill met Rohan Marley while touring as {{a member}} of the Fugees. The two {{gradually}} formed a close relationship, and while on tour, Hill became pregnant with his child. The pregnancy and other circumstances in her life inspired her to record a solo album. After contributing to fellow Fugees member Wyclef Jean's 1997 solo record The Carnival, Hill took time off from touring and recording due to her pregnancy and cases of writer's block. This pregnancy, however, renewed Hill's creativity, as she recalled in an interview several years later: [...] "When some women are pregnant, their hair and their nails grow, but for me it was my mind and ability to create. I had the desire to write in a capacity that I hadn't done in a while. I don't know if it's a hormonal or emotional thing... I was very in touch with <b>my</b> <b>feelings</b> at the time." [...] Of the early writing process, Hill said, [...] "Every time I got hurt, every time I was disappointed, every time I learned, I just wrote a song." ...|$|E
500|$|The Nightfly is more unapologetically jazzy than Fagen's {{previous}} work with Steely Dan, and his lyrics are more wistful and nostalgic than biting. Fagen aimed for his lyrics to have [...] "as little irony as possible," [...] and {{his goal was}} to make an album that was fun to listen to. As many of the songs come from an adolescent viewpoint, he hoped for them to maintain [...] "a certain innocence." [...] Walter Becker was responsible for the more sardonic elements in Steely Dan, and many writers have considered his absence the reason for the album's [...] "warm and nostalgic" [...] tone. Another difference between The Nightfly and his work with Becker is that it maintains a focus on a [...] "certain period [...] motif," [...] according to Fagen. Though Fagen hints in the album's liner notes that it is an autobiographical piece, he downplayed this notion in a later interview: [...] "It is not me exactly. It is a composite character of myself, what I remember and people I knew. Plus, it includes <b>my</b> <b>feelings</b> in retrospect." ...|$|E

500|$|Both Kanye West and Carlos Mencia responded {{within one}} day of the episode's {{original}} broadcast and said they enjoyed the parodies of themselves, although Kanye West said on his blog that his feelings were hurt. [...] After the episode was broadcast, Mencia wrote on his Twitter feed, [...] "They just made fun of me on South Park. I thought it was hysterical. Catch the rerun." [...] Dave Itzkoff, arts reporter for The New York Times, complimented Mencia for his response. West wrote on his blog, [...] "South Park murdered me last night and it's pretty damn funny. It hurts <b>my</b> <b>feelings</b> but what can you expect from South Park!" [...] West thanked the South Park writers in his blog entry and acknowledged {{he has a problem}} with his ego, but said he was trying to change. Parker and Stone said they were extremely surprised by West's reaction, and felt Mencia was treated far more harshly in the episode than West. Parker said, [...] "It was like, dude, we just said you were a gay fish. What are you talking about? It was so dumb." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{celebrities who}} were spoofed in 13th-season episodes responded to their portrayals. The day after [...] "Fishsticks" [...] aired, West wrote on his blog, [...] "South Park murdered {{me last night}} and it's pretty damn funny. It hurts <b>my</b> <b>feelings</b> but what can you expect from South Park!" [...] West thanked the South Park writers in his blog entry and {{acknowledged}} {{he has a problem}} with his ego, but said he was trying to change. The blog post drew substantial media attention; Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone said: [...] "Many have tried, all have failed, but in the end it only took four animated children from Colorado to topple Kanye West's ego." [...] Carlos Mencia, host of the Comedy Central show Mind of Mencia, was also spoofed in [...] "Fishsticks". He is portrayed as knowingly stealing credit for a joke he did not write, which is a reference to accusations other comedians have made that Mencia plagiarizes jokes from other people. After the episode aired, Mencia wrote on his Twitter feed, [...] "They just made fun of me on South Park. I thought it was hysterical. Catch the rerun." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{speech was}} applauded by Congolese delegates in the {{audience}} at the Palais de la Nation and broadcast by radio across the country. It was also broadcast live in Belgium by the state broadcaster, RTBF. After its delivery, the ceremonies were halted. Baudouin marched out of the room. A short inspection of local sites was arranged with Kasa-Vubu and lunch was served to cover the delay and an official lunch was held by the Congo River. After the break, Lumumba was persuaded by the outgoing Belgian resident, Walter Ganshof van der Meersch, to give a second speech which attempted to strike a more conciliatory tone between the two countries. In his second speech, Lumumba praised Baudouin and stated that [...] "I would not wish <b>my</b> <b>feelings</b> to be wrongly interpreted". After Lumumba's second speech, the official act of independence was signed by Lumumba and the Belgian Prime Minister Gaston Eyskens, {{as well as by}} the Foreign Ministers of both countries, bringing the official ceremonies to an end. The delegates then visited a performance of Congolese folklore at the Roi Baudouin Stadium before heading to an evening reception. At this event, Lumumba gave a further conciliatory speech the same evening, written for him by Eyskens, and drank a toast to Baudouin. The King, and much of the Belgian delegation, returned to Brussels on 1 July.|$|E
