"Honey, Just Allow <b>Me</b> <b>One</b> <b>More</b> Chance" [...] {{is based}} on [...] "Honey, Won't You Allow <b>Me</b> <b>One</b> <b>More</b> Chance?", a song {{dating back to the}} 1890s that was popularized by Henry Thomas in his 1928 recording. [...] "However, Thomas's {{original}} provided no more than a song title and a notion", writes Heylin, [...] "which Dylan turned into a personal plea to an absent lover to allow him 'one more chance to get along with you.' It is a vocal tour de force and ... showed a Dylan prepared to make light of his own blues by using the form itself." ...|$|E
