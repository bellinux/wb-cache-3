Each box indicates how many different sets of choices there are, in a particular sampling scheme. The row labeled [...] "Distinct" [...] means that the ordering matters. For example, if we have ten items, of which we choose two, then the choice (4,7) is different from (7,4). On the other hand, the row labeled [...] "Sn orders" [...] means that ordering doesn't matter: Choice (4,7) and (7,4) are equivalent. (Another way {{to think of this}} is to sort each choice by the item number, and throw out any duplicates that result.) In terms of probability distributions, sampling with replacement where ordering matters is comparable to describing the joint distribution of N separate random variables, each with an X-fold categorical distribution. The case where ordering doesn't matter, however, is comparable to describing a single multinomial distribution of N draws from an X-fold category, where only the number seen of each category matters.

40|$|Given {{independent}} samples from P and Q, two-sample permutation tests allow one to construct exact level tests when {{the null hypothesis}} is P=Q. On the other hand, when comparing or testing particular parameters θ of P and Q, such as their means or medians, permutation tests need not be level α, or even approximately level α in large samples. Under very weak assumptions for comparing estimators, we provide a general test procedure whereby the asymptotic validity of the permutation test holds while retaining the exact rejection probability α in finite samples when the underlying distributions are identical. The ideas are broadly applicable and special attention {{is given to the}} k-sample problem of comparing general parameters, whereby a permutation test is constructed which is exact level α under the hypothesis of identical distributions, but has asymptotic rejection probability α under the more general null hypothesis of equality of parameters. A Monte Carlo simulation study is performed as well. A quite general theory is possible based on a coupling construction, as well as a key contiguity argument for the multinomial and <b>multivariate</b> <b>hypergeometric</b> <b>distributions.</b> Comment: Published in at [URL] the Annals of Statistics ([URL] by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics ([URL]...|$|R

The notion of NOD random variables was introduced by Lehmann [3] and developed in Joag-Dev and Proschan [2]. Obviously, independent random variables are NOD.

They also presented an example in which X = (X 1, X 2, X 3, X 4) possesses NOD, but does not possess NA. Hence, we can see that NOD is weaker than NA.|$|R

40|$|An exact {{conditional}} {{approach is}} developed to test for certain forms of positive association between two ordinal variables (e. g. positive quadrant dependence, total positivity of order 2). The approach {{is based on the}} use of a test statistic measuring the goodness-of-(t of the model formulated according to the type of positive association of interest. The nuisance parameters, corresponding to the marginal distributions of the two variables, are eliminated by conditioning the inference on the observed margins. This, in turn, allows to remove the uncertainty on the conclusion of the test, which typically arises in the unconditional context where the null distribution of the test statistic depends on such parameters. Since the <b>multivariate</b> generalized <b>hypergeometric</b> <b>distribution,</b> which results from conditioning, is normally intractable, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are used to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the constrained model. The Pearson’s chi-squared statistics is used as a test statistic; a p-value forthis statistic is computed through simulation, when the data are sparse, or exploiting the asymptotic theory based on the chi-bar squared distribution. The extension of the present approach to deal with bivariate contingency tables, strati(ed according to one or more explanatory discrete variables, is also outlined. Finally, three applications based on real data are presented...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 In many {{statistical}} applications {{an interval}} is needed that will contain {{the values of}} all J future observations with some preassigned probability.

If two more test programs are to be conducted, an interval that will, with probability 1 -α, contain {{the maximum number of}} failures in either of the two programs is called an a confidence level prediction interval. In this thesis a general procedure is given for predicting future observations when there is one unknown parameter and other conditions are satisfied. The normal and the gamma distributions are used as examples to illustrate the procedure in the continuous case. It is shown that Poisson random variables can be predicted using the negative multinomial distribution. Tables of negative multinomial probabilities are provided and approximation procedures are suggested. It is also shown that negative binomial random variables can be predicted using the multivariate beta negative binomial and binomial random variables can be predicted using the <b>multivariate</b> negative <b>hypergeometric</b> <b>distribution.</b> The prediction intervals given in this thesis can also be used for simultaneous hypothesis testing for the Poisson, negative binomial and binomial distributions...|$|R

Formal approaches to such development – {{such as the}} reference prior ap-proach – often result in a constant prior for a discrete parameter, which is questionable for problems that exhibit certain types of structure.
