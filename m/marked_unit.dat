50|$|Commonly known {{names to}} {{describe}} police cars are (police) cruiser, squad car, panda car, area car and patrol car. Depending on {{the configuration of}} the emergency lights, a police car may also be called a <b>marked</b> <b>unit.</b> In some places a police car may also be informally known as a cop car, a black and white, a cherry top, a gumball machine, or a jam sandwich, in Los Angeles, from the early 50s, until the late 70s, the lights were different from most areas, with two forward-facing, stationary red lights, with amber flashing lights facing rearward, inside of black metal housings mounted to the roof of the car.|$|E
5000|$|Warriors of Chaos armies {{tend to be}} close-combat oriented, {{with few}} to no ranged capabilities, other than magic. Their primary tactic is simply to engage the enemy in close combat.When playing against a chaos army {{it is best to}} avoid contact via close-combat, and instead stay at a {{distance}} and utilize a gun line or magic.Almost all available units of the Warriors of Chaos may take a [...] "Mark". A mark is a symbol that represents the one of the four gods of chaos that has granted favor upon the bearer. A <b>marked</b> <b>unit</b> gains an ability that is oriented with the mark of their God. In older editions of the army, all units were required to have the same mark.|$|E
5000|$|Washington State Patrol {{patrol cars}} are usually white in color, however {{they can be}} of any color or make. The typical <b>marked</b> <b>unit</b> {{features}} two prominent features: the Washington State Patrol shield logo, and the dark blue thunderbolt that underlies the State Patrol shield. In addition, marked vehicles bearing these markings usually feature the words [...] "STATE PATROL" [...] above the shield and thunderbolt, and these features are usually found on the front right hand and front left hand door of the vehicle. Washington State Patrol also operates unmarked units, including SUVs and sports cars such as the Camaro, and luxury cars such as Volvo. Newer vehicles such as the Chevrolet Impala and the Dodge Charger {{have been added to}} the motor pool. Some patrol cars are marked, but do not have light bars. The Washington State Patrol's marked vehicles have been the Ford Crown Victoria, which has been retired and the last of the 'Crown Vics' was deployed at the end of June 2012. The new marked patrol vehicles were supposed to be the Chevrolet Caprice, but issues with reliability caused the patrol to abandon the Caprice. The new standard patrol vehicle is the Ford Interceptor Utility.|$|E
50|$|The {{excavated}} area of Melkhoutboom Cave {{was divided}} into stratigraphic units based on soil composition and cultural content. The names given to these units and their estimated ages based on radiocarbon dates of hearths or artifacts are as follows, from bedrock to surface: Basal Unit (15,400 years BP), Rock Fall Unit (10,500 years BP), Medium Brown Series Unit (7,660 years BP), Wilton Base <b>Marker</b> <b>Unit</b> (7,300 years BP), <b>Marker</b> <b>Unit</b> (indirectly dated by comparison to preceding and overlying units), Wedge Unit (6,980 years BP), Main Bedding Unit (5,900 years BP), Cut Away Frontal Unit (2,870 years BP), the Overlie of the Main Bedding Unit, and the Surface Unit. The Wilton Base <b>Marker</b> <b>Unit</b> in particular appears to represent a major technological break from underlying units based on the cultural material found.|$|R
50|$|During the Second World War, the Imperial Japanese {{armed forces}} {{occupied}} {{and entered the}} municipal town of Baras in 1942. The local guerrillas of the General <b>Marking</b> <b>Unit</b> sieged and invaded the town of Baras and attacked the Japanese from 1942 to 1945. The local Filipino troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the Philippine Constabulary units liberated the municipality of Baras in 1945.

5000|$|MSP's {{new cars}} used to all have interior-mounted {{emergency}} lighting, with no lightbars on the roof. But they have slowly started putting extremely low profile Whelen Legacy light bars on new <b>marked</b> <b>units.</b> The <b>marked</b> cars usually have [...] "ghost graphics," [...] lettering {{in a blue}} slightly darker than {{the color of the}} car but not easily seen at a glance. Finally, while most <b>marked</b> <b>units</b> have blue license plates, many detective and unmarked units have regular civilian license plates.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} study which investigates the phonological {{structure}} of Hindi declarative and interrogative tunes, using the autosegmental-metrical(AM) framework developed by Pierrehumbert [1] and others. This study finds that Hindi is an accentual phrase (AP) {{language and the}} AP is the smallest tonally <b>marked</b> <b>unit</b> which carries the pitch accent. The default pitch accent {{is found to be}} L*+H, a bitonal pitch accent. This study also finds that Hindi supports three types of phrasal tones, namely, accentual phrase (AP), intermediate phrase (ip) and intonational phrase (Ip).

40|$|The {{compounds}} NdBaCuSnTiO, SmBaCuSnTi O and GdBaCu TiO {{have been}} synthesized by {{reaction of the}} component oxides at 1025 °C and their structures refined from powder X-ray diffraction data. The materials crystallise with a quadrupled perovskite unit cell, {{similar to that of}} LaBaCuSn O containing alternating double layers of copper and titanium/tin. Decreasing lanthanide size and increasing titanium content is associated with a <b>marked</b> <b>unit</b> cell contraction and a reduction in the mismatch between the different double-layer dimensions. A reduction in the copper-oxygen distances in the CuO planes from 2. 007 Å in La BaCuSnO to 1. 951 Å in GdBaCuTiO produces a copper-oxygen interaction similar to that found in high-temperature superconductors...|$|E
40|$|We {{prove that}} fairly general spaces of tilings of R^d are fiber bundles over the torus T^d, with totally {{disconnected}} fiber. This was conjectured (in a weaker form) in [W 3], and proved in certain cases. In fact, {{we show that}} each such space is homeomorphic to the d-fold suspension of a Z^d subshift (or equivalently, a tiling space whose tiles are <b>marked</b> <b>unit</b> d-cubes). The only restrictions on our tiling spaces are that 1) the tiles {{are assumed to be}} polygons (polyhedra if d> 2) that meet full-edge to full-edge (or full-face to full-face), 2) only a finite number of tile types are allowed, and 3) each tile type appears in only a finite number of orientations. The proof is constructive, and we illustrate it by constructing a ``square'' version of the Penrose tiling system. Comment: 11 pages, including 4 embedded postscript figure...|$|E

5000|$|The {{mark was}} a {{currency}} or {{unit of account}} in many nations. It is named for the <b>mark</b> <b>unit</b> of weight. The word mark comes from a merging of three Teutonic/Germanic words, Latinised in 9th century post-classical Latin as , , [...] or [...] It was a measure of weight mainly for gold and silver, commonly used throughout Western Europe and often equivalent to eight ounces. Considerable variations, however, occurred throughout the Middle Ages.|$|R
40|$|The {{stratigraphy}} of the Smoky Hill Chalk Member of the Niobrara Chalk {{of western}} Kansas is well {{understood as a}} result of the work of Hattin (1982) and Stewart (1988). <b>Marker</b> <b>units</b> identified by Hattin (1982) allow quick determination of the stratigraphic position of a specific outcrop. This study demonstrates that it is now possible to determine the stratigraphic positions of specimens from locality data, thus permitting one to infer stratigraphic position of specimens collected long ago. This technique is particularly useful in the upper half of the Smoky Hill Chalk Member, where biostratigraphy is not informative. The stratigraphic distribution of the type skulls of the pterosaur Pteranodon is examined as an example of the procedure, which in turn demonstrates that the procedure can have the power to reject hypotheses. Inferring stratigraphic positions of fossil vertebrates may be useful in further studies of the large collections of fossil vertebrates from the Smoky Hill Chalk Member. In addition, examination of the stratigraphic distribution of outcrops of the Smoky Hill Chalk Member in western Kansas suggests that most of the fossil vertebrates collected from the member came from a rather restricted stratigraphic interval between <b>Marker</b> <b>Units</b> 15 and 20...|$|R

MSRP for the (375hp) ZR-1 in 1990 was $58,995, almost twice the cost of a (250hp) non-ZR-1, and had increased to $66,278 by 1995; some dealers successfully <b>marked</b> <b>units</b> as high as $100,000. Even at base MSRP, this meant that the ZR-1 was competing in the same price bracket as cars like the Porsche 964, making it a hard sell for GM dealers.|$|R

The hardened model, {{based on the}} rogatywka Mk. 1935, olive green with black peak, is used in full gala uniforms, while the rim colour <b>marks</b> <b>unit</b> type (for example, navy blue - typical, crimson - military police, green - artillery, and so on). It was not worn {{during most of the}} People's Republic of Poland era but was reintroduced for ceremonial wear by the Honour Guard Company in 1989. The soft version was used before World War II and during the People's Republic of Poland period for garrison dress; it was withdrawn after 1990.|$|R
5000|$|High {{visibility}} markings - Responding {{emergency vehicles}} {{want to be}} conspicuous, as do emergency vehicles parked at a scene (so they do not get hit by other vehicles). Many departments use passive visual warnings such as reflective lettering and/or striping to increase their visibility. Other patterns include checker-board (battenburg) or chevrons. For police departments, {{there can be a}} competing need for stealth. Police departments can use minimally marked cars with subdued graphics that blend in with the car's body color, but they can also use unmarked civilian-like vehicles (typically for detectives, undercover investigators, SWAT, and higher-ranking officers), which may be similar to their <b>marked</b> <b>units,</b> or may be entirely different.|$|R

Results imply consideration about systemic, phonotactic and realisational aspects of the intonational system(s) of Italian, mainly regarding the <b>marked</b> <b>units,</b> their distribution and the differences related to diatopic variation. They also seem to confirm the existence of different patterns related to different kinds of questions (information-seeking vs. confirmation-seeking questions), which has been shown for other varieties of Italian...|$|R
