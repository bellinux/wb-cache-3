40|$|This article takes {{a systems}} {{perspective}} to study <b>marketing</b> <b>channel</b> system structure dynamics and {{their interactions with}} economic system dynamics. A novel, non-linear method from ecology is used to establish a causal network of mostly bi-directional causal forcing between economic variables and <b>marketing</b> <b>channel</b> system structure. This resulting causal network facilitates a comprehensive understanding of a <b>marketing</b> <b>channel</b> system. The study finds a highly endogenous and non-linearly interrelated subsystem encompassing online/offline retail channel structure, retail/wholesale channel structure, the ratio of import to consumption and the competitive dynamics of the economic system. Surprisingly, <b>marketing</b> <b>channel</b> system structure is rather resilient to changes in economic growth. In contrast, changes in retail/wholesale channel structure affect economic growth. The results may help to caution marketing managers changing their <b>marketing</b> <b>channel</b> structures too routinely. Moreover, the identified causal network presents {{a starting point for}} further empirical <b>marketing</b> <b>channel</b> system analyses. Implications particularly affect future empirical <b>marketing</b> <b>channel</b> system studies based on linear structural models...|$|R

Recently, telecommunications software vendors such as Telcordia and Ericsson have promoted yield management as a strategy for communications {{service providers}} to generate additional revenue and reduce capital expenditures by maximizing subscriber use of available network bandwidth. Approaches include basing a strategy on innovative services explicitly designed to use only spare capacity and borrowing proven methods from the airline industry. The approach can {{be more difficult to}} implement in the telecommunications industry than the airlines sector because of the difficulty to control and sometimes refuse network access to customers. Similarities that exist between the airline and telecom industries include a large sunk cost combined with low marginal cost, perishable inventory, reservations, pricing flexibility and the opportunity to upsell. Differences that present challenges for communications service providers include low-value transactions and overall network complexity. Suggested approaches to executing a successful yield management strategy include accurate network information collection, bandwidth capacity allocation that doesn’t impact service quality, the deployment of service management software such as real time policy and real-time charging, and using new <b>marketing</b> <b>channels</b> to target consumers [...] with innovative services.|$|E
