40|$|Abstract The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to give a {{reasonably}} comprehensive discussion of what is commonly referred to as the bifurcation analysis applied to an indirect field oriented control of induction machines (IFOC). In the current work, we study the appearance of self-sustained oscillations in AC drives and compute their corresponding stability margins. As the dynamics is explored, a transition mode to chaotic states via codimension one Hopf bifurcations is detected. Based on qualitative approach, investigations of both parametric and phase plane singularities in IFOC induction <b>motor</b> <b>lead</b> to put into evidence equilibrium points and complex oscillatory phenomena such as limit cycles and chaotic behaviors. Furthermore we found out the bifurcation sets and the attraction basins related to such nonlinear phenomena. Bifurcations originated by system and control parameter fluctuations may lead to stability loss. The adequate remedy is to keep the parameters and the state variables inside the well known normal operating domains computed in this paper. It is worth noting that a rational use of the main analysis tools such as bifurcation sets and attraction basins permits to cancel non desired oscillations and limit cycles by choosing the appropriate initializations leading to the desired behavior. The interpretation of these results contributes to widen the understanding of the mechanism of certain types of singularities and the stability domain boundaries either in phase space or in parameter space and to demonstrate the suitability of bifurcation theory t...|$|E
40|$|SummaryRecBCD is a DNA helicase {{comprising}} two motor subunits, RecB and RecD. Recognition of the recombination hotspot, χ, causes RecBCD {{to pause}} and reduce translocation speed. To understand this control of translocation, we used single-molecule visualization to compare RecBCD to the RecBCDK 177 Q mutant with a defective RecD motor. RecBCDK 177 Q paused at χ {{but did not}} change its translocation velocity. RecBCDK 177 Q translocated {{at the same rate}} as the wild-type post-χ enzyme, implicating RecB as the <b>lead</b> <b>motor</b> after χ. P 1 nuclease treatment eliminated the wild-type enzyme's velocity changes, revealing a χ-containing ssDNA loop preceding χ recognition and showing that RecD is the faster motor before χ. We conclude that before χ, RecD is the <b>lead</b> <b>motor</b> but after χ, the slower RecB <b>motor</b> <b>leads,</b> implying a switch in motors at χ. We suggest that degradation of foreign DNA needs fast translocation, whereas DNA repair uses slower translocation to coordinate RecA loading onto ssDNA...|$|R

Fault diagnosis in induction motor based on stator current is conventionally conducted by spectral analysis. But classical spectral analysis doesn’t provide good results for transient and continuously varying load torque conditions. In this work, energy contained in the signal is used for the fault detection of induction motors. The experimental data from the induction motor are acquired under healthy and faulty conditions of the motor. Wavelets have been used for the feature extraction from the acquired data.

Since motors are the principle energy users, different energy savings, strategies have been applied to reduce their energy consumption and associated emissions released into the atmosphere. These strategies include using high efficient motors and Variable Speed Drive (VSD). It has been estimated that there can be a total energy savings of 1765 MWh, 2703 MWh and 3605 MWh by utilizing energyefficient motors for a 50 %, 75 % and 100 % load respectively.

Soft-starting techniques, which {{are commonly used}} with three-phase induction <b>motors,</b> <b>lead</b> to more reliable operation and allow {{the reduction of the}} motor sizing: they limit the phase currents during the starting transient in order to obtain a smooth connection to the power supply.

The present work deals with different soft-starting techniques, implemented on a simulation tool. Some of them are based on the so-called point-on-wave switching, which is in fact a delayed insertion, either simultaneous or independent, of both the main and auxiliary phases to the main supply.
