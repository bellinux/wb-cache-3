500|$|Fifteen {{tracks were}} {{recorded}} for the album, thirteen {{of which were}} included on its release. Spin magazine's Christopher R. Weingarten has described the record as featuring a mix of genres, including [...] "groany, smoky, Morricone-jazz" [...] and [...] "the types of epic, majestic choruses that Patton diehards <b>might</b> <b>remember</b> from the final Faith No More LP, Album of the Year". Denison has described the album's sound as just being that of [...] "a rock band", adding [...] "I think we’re a very clever, intense sort of spooked-out, dangerous rock band, but still a rock band".|$|E
500|$|Backstage at SNL, Hartman {{was called}} [...] "the Glue", a name coined by Adam Sandler, {{according}} to Jay Mohr's book Gasping for Airtime. However, {{according to a}} biography on Hartman's life entitled You <b>Might</b> <b>Remember</b> Me: The Life and Times of Phil Hartman written by Mike Thomas, author and {{staff writer for the}} Chicago Sun-Times, the nickname was created by SNL cast member and Hartman's frequent on-screen collaborator Jan Hooks. Hartman often helped other cast members. For example, he aided Jan Hooks in overcoming her stage fright. SNL creator Lorne Michaels explained the reason for the name: [...] "He kind of held the show together. He gave to everybody and demanded very little. He was very low-maintenance." [...] Michaels also added that Hartman was [...] "the least appreciated" [...] cast member by commentators outside the show, and praised his ability [...] "to do five or six parts in a show where you're playing support or you're doing remarkable character work". Hartman won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program for SNL in 1989, sharing the award with the show's other writers. He was nominated in the same category in 1987, and individually in 1994 for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} of the {{sensation}} S Wittgenstein argues that there is no criterion for the correctness of such an ostensive definition, since whatever seems right will be right, 'And that only means that here we can't talk about [...] "right".' The exact reason for the rejection of private language has been contentious. One interpretation, which has been called memory scepticism, has it that one <b>might</b> <b>remember</b> the sensation wrongly, and that as a result one might misuse the term S [...] The other, called meaning scepticism, has it that one can never be sure of the meaning of a term defined in this way.|$|E

2500|$|Jay Kanter, Brando's agent, producer, and friend, defended him in Daily Variety: [...] "Marlon {{has spoken}} to me for hours about his fondness for the Jewish people, {{and he is a}} {{well-known}} supporter of Israel." [...] Similarly, Louie Kemp, in his article for Jewish Journal, wrote: [...] "You <b>might</b> <b>remember</b> him as Don Vito Corleone, Stanley Kowalski or the eerie Col. Walter E. Kurtz in 'Apocalypse Now', but I remember Marlon Brando as a mensch and a personal friend of the Jewish people when they needed it most." [...] In an interview with NBC Today one day after Brando's death, King also defended Brando's comments, saying that they had been blown out of proportion and taken out of context.|$|E
2500|$|Regular Show will {{occasionally}} {{make use}} of licensed songsmostly from the 1980s; this began when Quintel and the staff writers started recording the animatics using copyrighted songs for the montage scenes. The network executives watched the animatic and asked the crew {{if they wanted to}} use some of the songs for the finished episodes. Quintel said that the songs are chosen for their suitability for the scene, whether they sound good and are affordable. Quintel enjoys using the songs in the episodes because adult viewers <b>might</b> <b>remember</b> them and younger viewers might appreciate older music. Songs have included [...] "You're the Best Around", [...] "Mississippi Queen" [...] and [...] "A Holly Jolly Christmas".|$|E
2500|$|On August 6, 2015, Schumer {{announced}} {{his opposition to}} the nuclear deal with Iran. Schumer planned to tell the White House, then his Senate colleagues, and then the public, but the White House leaked the news during the Republican debate in what CBS News described as an [...] "apparent attempt to limit coverage". Arms control expert Jeffrey Lewis derided Schumer's decision, noting that Schumer was making factually incorrect claims about the amount of time in which the treaty would allow inspection of Iranian nuclear facilities. In what The Guardian described as a [...] "shot across Schumer's bow," [...] White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that fellow Democrats <b>might</b> <b>remember</b> Schumer's decision when deciding whom to elect as their next majority leader.|$|E

2500|$|Nick Levine of Digital Spy said [...] "Written by Alicia Keys and {{produced}} by Swizz Beatz (probably {{best known for}} Beyoncé's 'Check On It' and 'Ring the Alarm'), it's a midtempo disco track with an unabashedly feelgood message. [...] "If he {{makes you feel like}} a million dollar bill," [...] Whitney sings on the chorus, 'Say oh-oh-oh, say oh-oh-oh'. The Voice is deeper and raspier than you <b>might</b> <b>remember,</b> but she's still capable of going for a money note. 'Million Dollar Bill' won't be storming any barns in a hurry, but it's a classy, dignified and thoroughly likeable comeback effort. Whitney, it's good to have you back." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com gave a mixed review saying, [...] "The good news on [...] "Million Dollar Bill" [...] is the performance is undeniably the Whitney Houston we all know. [...] The down side is it's all almost too familiar. The arrangement courtesy producer Swizz Beatz is very old school R [...] Alicia Keys has written a song that fits very well with her tradition of [...] "old soul" [...] songs, but Whitney Houston has failed to give it a new twist that would successfully make the old stunningly new again.". He also gave the song 3.5 stars out of five.|$|E
