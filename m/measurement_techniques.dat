5|$|Snow science {{addresses}} how snow forms, its distribution, {{and processes}} affecting how snowpacks change over time. Scientists improve storm forecasting, study global snow cover {{and its effect}} on climate, glaciers, and water supplies around the world. The study includes physical properties of the material as it changes, bulk properties of in-place snow packs, and the aggregate properties of regions with snow cover. In doing so, they employ on-the-ground physical <b>measurement</b> <b>techniques</b> to establish ground truth and remote sensing techniques to develop understanding of snow-related processes over large areas.|$|E
5|$|In {{the project}} to replace the last {{artifact}} that underpins much of the International System of Units (SI), {{a variety of other}} very different technologies and approaches were considered and explored over many years. They too are covered below. Some of these now-abandoned approaches were based on equipment and procedures that would have enabled the reproducible production of new, kilogram-mass prototypes on demand (albeit with extraordinary effort) using <b>measurement</b> <b>techniques</b> and material properties that are ultimately based on, or traceable to, fundamental constants. Others were based on devices that measured either the acceleration or weight of hand-tuned kilogram test masses and which expressed their magnitudes in electrical terms via special components that permit traceability to fundamental constants. All approaches depend on converting a weight measurement to a mass, and therefore require the precise measurement of the strength of gravity in laboratories. All approaches would have precisely fixed one or more constants of nature at a defined value.|$|E

This <b>measurement</b> <b>technique</b> includes a discontinuous heat source {{associated with a}} minimum of two thermal sensors arranged downstream. The heat source is used to generate a signal code [dT/dt] by injection of local thermal pulses into the flow line. The thermal sensors detect the time-dependent thermal gradients in the fluid at different positions. Herewith, the <b>measurement</b> <b>technique</b> aims at the determination of the flow velocity by ToF, with the particular advantage of applying to measurements of any fluids with unknown properties.

There are several <b>measurement</b> <b>techniques</b> to measure stress in a material. However, techniques using optical measurements, magnetic measurements, X-ray diffraction, and neutron diffraction are all limited to measuring surface or near surface stress or strains. Acoustic waves propagate with ease through materials and provide thus a means to probe the interior of structures, where the stress and strain level is important for the overall structural integrity.|$|E

40|$|The {{author has}} studied several legacy {{landmark}} methodologies {{to develop an}} original <b>measurement</b> <b>technique.</b> Spherical harmonics modeling practices were leveraged to accurately represent a source directivity pattern. In this thesis a lightweight microphone measurement array that was manually maneuvered around a static noise source was employed. The <b>measurement</b> <b>technique</b> consisted of inserting a head-tracker sensor onto the microphone array to allow {{the location of the}} captured acoustic Sound Pressure Level (SPL) to be investigated. By leveraging the historical methodologies the acoustic SPL and location data collected with this technique were processes to represent a directivity pattern of the compressor source chosen. The results indicated that the <b>measurement</b> <b>technique</b> is valid for capturing acoustic SPL and location data of a static noise source with a dynamic array. Propagation techniques yielded a ten decibel difference between the measured and predicated SPLs. The dynamic <b>measurement</b> <b>technique</b> and method for characterizing the three-dimensional acoustic directivity of a static noise source is further presented in this thesis...|$|R

25|$|To assess job performance, {{reliable}} and valid measures must be established. While there are many sources of error with performance ratings, error can be reduced through rater training and {{through the use of}} behaviorally-anchored rating scales. Such scales can be used to clearly define the behaviors that constitute poor, average, and superior performance. Additional factors that complicate the measurement of job performance include the instability of job performance over time due to forces such as changing performance criteria, the structure of the job itself and the restriction of variation in individual performance by organizational forces. These factors include errors in job <b>measurement</b> <b>techniques,</b> acceptance and the justification of poor performance and lack of importance of individual performance.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{laboratory}} did not employ any revolutionary <b>measurement</b> <b>techniques,</b> it was unique {{because of the}} simple logistics of constructing such a demonstration within a limited space and have it quickly and efficiently be able to gather all the necessary data. The laboratory itself was a see-through (lattice-walled) fenced off gallery measuring 36 feet long by 6 feet long. To collect data efficiently, Galton {{had to make the}} process as simple as possible for people to understand. As a result, subjects were taken through {{the laboratory}} in pairs so that explanations could be given to two at a time, also in the hope that one of the two would confidently take the initiative to go through all the tests first, encouraging the other. With this design, the total time spent in the exhibit was fourteen minutes for each pair.|$|E
25|$|Extrinsic {{fiber optic}} sensors use an optical fiber cable, {{normally}} a multi-mode one, to transmit modulated light from either a non-fiber optical sensor—or an electronic sensor connected to an optical transmitter. A major benefit of extrinsic sensors is {{their ability to}} reach otherwise inaccessible places. An example is the measurement of temperature inside aircraft jet engines by using a fiber to transmit radiation into a radiation pyrometer outside the engine. Extrinsic sensors {{can be used in}} the same way to measure the internal temperature of electrical transformers, where the extreme electromagnetic fields present make other <b>measurement</b> <b>techniques</b> impossible. Extrinsic sensors measure vibration, rotation, displacement, velocity, acceleration, torque, and twisting. A solid state version of the gyroscope, using the interference of light, has been developed. The fiber optic gyroscope (FOG) has no moving parts, and exploits the Sagnac effect to detect mechanical rotation.|$|E

With the application of ever-improving <b>measurement</b> <b>techniques</b> for single molecules, and correlation with other independent proxies in the geological record that can help constrain some variables, investigating the hydrogen isotope composition of leaf waxes can be extremely productive. Leaf wax δD data has been successfully applied to improving our understanding of climate driven changes in terrestrial hydrology, by demonstrating that ocean circulation and surface temperature {{have a significant effect}} on continental precipitation. Leaf wax δD values have also been used as records of paleoaltimetry to reconstruct the elevation gradients in ancient mountain ranges based on the effect of altitude on rain water δD.|$|E
25|$|At the {{cognitive}} level, cognitive neuroscience addresses {{the questions of}} how psychological functions are produced by neural circuitry. The emergence of powerful new <b>measurement</b> <b>techniques</b> such as neuroimaging (e.g., fMRI, PET, SPECT), electrophysiology, and human genetic analysis combined with sophisticated experimental techniques from cognitive psychology allows neuroscientists and psychologists to address abstract questions such as how human cognition and emotion are mapped to specific neural substrates. Although many studies still hold a reductionist stance looking for the neurobiological basis of cognitive phenomena, recent research shows {{that there is an}} interesting interplay between neuroscientific findings and conceptual research, soliciting and integrating both perspectives. For example, the neuroscience research on empathy solicited an interesting interdisciplinary debate involving philosophy, psychology and psychopathology. Moreover, the neuroscientific identification of multiple memory systems related to different brain areas has challenged the idea of memory as a literal reproduction of the past, supporting a view of memory as a generative, constructive and dynamic process.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{differences}} in their construction, microphones have their own characteristic responses to sound. This difference in response produces non-uniform phase and frequency responses. In addition, microphones are not uniformly sensitive to sound pressure, and can accept differing levels without distorting. Although for scientific applications microphones with a more uniform response are desirable, this is often {{not the case for}} music recording, as the non-uniform response of a microphone can produce a desirable coloration of the sound. There is an international standard for microphone specifications, but few manufacturers adhere to it. As a result, comparison of published data from different manufacturers is difficult because different <b>measurement</b> <b>techniques</b> are used. The Microphone Data Website has collated the technical specifications complete with pictures, response curves and technical data from the microphone manufacturers for every currently listed microphone, and even a few obsolete models, and shows the data for them all in one common format for ease of comparison..

500|$|One of {{the most}} common {{industrial}} applications of optical interferometry is as a versatile measurement tool for the high precision examination of surface topography. Popular interferometric <b>measurement</b> <b>techniques</b> include Phase Shifting Interferometry (PSI), and Vertical Scanning Interferometry(VSI), also known as scanning white light interferometry (SWLI) or by the ISO term Coherence Scanning Interferometry (CSI), CSI exploits coherence to extend the range of capabilities for interference microscopy. These techniques are widely used in micro-electronic and micro-optic fabrication. PSI uses monochromatic light and provides very precise measurements; however it is only usable for surfaces that are very smooth. CSI often uses white light and high numerical apertures, and rather than looking at the phase of the fringes, as does PSI, looks for best position of maximum fringe contrast or some other feature of the overall fringe pattern. [...] In its simplest form, CSI provides less precise measurements than PSI but can be used on rough surfaces. Some configurations of CSI, variously known as Enhanced VSI (EVSI), high-resolution SWLI or Frequency Domain Analysis (FDA), use coherence effects in combination with interference phase to enhance precision.|$|E
500|$|Slotted {{lines are}} {{relatively}} cheap and can perform {{many of the}} measurements done by more expensive equipment such as network analysers. [...] However, slotted line <b>measurement</b> <b>techniques</b> are more labour-intensive and often do not directly output the desired parameter; some calculation or plotting is frequently required. [...] In particular, they can only carry out a measurement at one spot frequency at a time so producing a plot of a parameter versus frequency is very time consuming. [...] This is to be compared to modern instruments like network and spectrum analysers which are intrinsically frequency swept and produce a plot instantly. [...] Slotted lines have now largely been superseded, but are still found where capital costs are an issue. [...] Their remaining uses are mostly in the millimetre band, where modern test apparatus is either prohibitively expensive or not available at all, and with academic laboratories and hobbyists. [...] They are also useful as a teaching aid as the user is more directly exposed to basic line phenomena than with more sophisticated instruments.|$|E

As a whole, blue whales from the Northern Atlantic and Pacific are smaller on average than those from Antarctic waters.

This came about because the edges of the tail flukes were typically cut off, and the lower jaw often falls open upon death. Many of the larger whales in the whaling records (especially those over [...] ) were probably measured incorrectly or even deliberately exaggerated. The heaviest weight ever reported was for a southern hemisphere female in 1947, it is likely that the largest blue whales would have weighed over [...] The longest whales ever recorded were two females measuring , but in neither of these cases was the piecemeal weight gathered. Possibly the largest recorded male was killed near the South Shetland Islands in 1926 and was measured at 31.7m (104ft).|$|E
