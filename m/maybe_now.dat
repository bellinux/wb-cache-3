500|$|Despite his {{mainstream}} success {{upon his}} move to America, Dale remained primarily {{known for his}} role as Jim Robinson in Neighbours in the United Kingdom and Australia for several years. This was spoofed in a promotional ident for the UK's Channel 4 in 2007 which sees Dale taking part in a mock interview about the sudden upturn in his career, before being accosted by an Australian fan, who recognises him as Jim Robinson. Discussing this association after Ugly Bettys 2007 Golden Globe win, Dale noted: [...] "Every article I read I'm always, 'Ex-soap star Jim Robinson'. <b>Maybe</b> <b>now</b> people will just get to know me as actor Alan Dale." [...] In 2007, Amazon.co.uk reported that they had sold more DVDs of films and television shows featuring Dale than any featuring other ex-Neighbours cast members.|$|E
500|$|... "A Time Machine Is My New Girlfriend" [...] is a frenetic rocker with a Bo Diddley rhythm, {{and lyrics}} cautioning {{listeners}} that relationships can come with [...] "late fees". Hunt explained its lyrics to be {{a metaphor for}} his lover making him feel younger. The title track features metronomic drumming and chicken scratch riffs. It is about people from different economic classes falling in love after social and economic conditions moved them into the same neighborhood. The setting is described in the first verse, [...] "It's the end of white flight / even tycoons are licking their wounds / economic blight got the neighborhood looking gap-toothed / end of white flight / <b>maybe</b> <b>now</b> you see something you like / money tight and you're hating your life". Hunt said that writing the song was [...] "essentially a response {{to some of the}} things I have seen {{as a result of the}} global recession we are going through. I wasn't trying to make any political statement. I was more making a philosophical comment that essentially says we have all these unspoken issues in our society. But I see a collision of those ideas and unresolved issues. My question is what could you have been hoping for when we make the kind of decisions in our society that we have made." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{band members}} started {{to discuss the}} {{possibility}} of a Europe reunion in 1998. [...] "Mic and Ian came over to see me in Ireland," [...] Tempest said, [...] "Then whilst we were there, John Norum called from LA, and we were like 'Yes, <b>maybe</b> <b>now</b> is the right time to get things started again'." [...] For the 2000 millennium celebrations, Europe was asked to do a concert in Stockholm on New Year's Eve 1999. That would be Europe's first and, to date, only concert with both of their lead guitarists, since both John Norum and Kee Marcello had accepted the offer to play that evening {{with the rest of the}} group. They played [...] "Rock the Night" [...] and [...] "The Final Countdown".|$|E

5000|$|ACIDIC is [...] "the hardest-working young indie {{rock band}} in Southern California - or <b>maybe,</b> by <b>now,</b> {{in the entire}} US-of-A!"

5000|$|In {{the lyric}} for 'Nimble Bastard,' I'm {{in praise of}} someone. I've known {{a handful of people}} in my life who've come into the most horrific {{circumstances}} whether it's physical injury or psychological or failure and they'll be as low as you could possibly be and you're like, 'Dude, this guy's done.' And then somehow they pop back up and shake it off and then are more strong and resilient as a result. That is this nimble bastard that I'm in praise of. It could be construed as a political statement in that the left took a massive hit {{over the past few months}} so <b>maybe</b> <b>now's</b> the time to learn from those failures... but that's not what I had in mind when I wrote the lyrics.|$|R
2500|$|By {{later in}} December, Kennedy had mounted {{a concerted effort}} to gain support around the state, and had made several trips and {{appearances}} as well. [...] Kennedy's appointment was supported by Congresswoman Louise Slaughter, State Assemblyman Vito Lopez, New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, former New York City Mayor Ed Koch and the New York Post editorial page. [...] She received criticism for not voting in a number of Democratic primaries and general elections since registering in 1988 in New York City and also for not providing details about her political views. Kennedy declined to make disclosures of her financial dealings or other personal matters, stating that she would not release the information publicly unless she was selected by Paterson, at which time she would be subject to the same background checks as all appointees. Kennedy acknowledged {{that she was going to}} have to prove herself: [...] "Going into politics is something people have asked me about forever. When this opportunity came along, which was sort of unexpected, I thought, `Well, <b>maybe</b> <b>now.</b> How about now?' [...] work twice as hard as anybody else ... I am an unconventional choice ... We're starting to see there are many ways into public life and public service." ...|$|E

Any way, don't {{let him have}} to say she died here, without his hearing a word how bad she was." ...|$|E
60|$|O, look we are so! Chamber music. Could make {{a kind of}} pun on that. It is a kind {{of music}} I often thought when she. Acoustics that is. Tinkling. Empty vessels make most noise. Because the acoustics, the {{resonance}} changes according as the weight of the water is equal to the law of falling water. Like those rhapsodies of Liszt's, Hungarian, gipsyeyed. Pearls. Drops.

6000|$|... "Bless you, that's all right," [...] said Miss Sarah amiably. [...] "You needn't worry--there's no harm done. Thank goodness, we Copps {{keep our}} pantries presentable {{at all times}} and don't care who sees into them. As for that old duckhouse, I'm glad it's smashed, for <b>maybe</b> <b>now</b> Martha will agree to having it taken down. She never would before for fear it might come in handy {{sometime}} and I've had to whitewash it every spring. But {{you might as well}} argue with a post as with Martha. She went to town today--I drove her to the station. And you want to buy my platter. Well, what will you give for it?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the (then) record low of {{the arctic}} sea ice extend in 2007, Mark Serreze, the {{director}} of US National Snow and Ice Data Center, stated [...] "If you asked {{me a couple of}} years ago when the Arctic could lose all of its ice then I would have said 2100, or 2070 <b>maybe.</b> But <b>now</b> I think that 2030 is a reasonable estimate." ...|$|R

But during {{the reign of}} Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah, Mukim Berakas was divided into two parts; Mukim Berakas 'A' and Mukim Berakas 'B' due to rapid {{residential}} and infra-structural developments. Mukim Berakas 'A' used to include Kampong Lambak Kiri (Jalan Pasir Berakas 'B') and Kampong Lambak Kanan (Jalan Pasir Berakas 'B').

60|$|Josiah turned obediently. He {{heard the}} door slam as he went down the walk. As in a {{nightmare}} he opened the gate he had opened ten thousand times and stepped out on the sidewalk. He felt dazed. Surely it was a dream. Very soon he would wake up {{with a sigh of}} relief. He rubbed his forehead and paused indecisively. The monotonous complaint of the bucksaw came to his ears. If that boy had any of the old Childs spirit in him, sooner or later he'd run away. Agatha was beyond the endurance of human flesh. She had not changed, unless for the worse, if such a thing were possible. That boy would surely run for it, maybe soon. <b>Maybe</b> <b>now.</b>|$|E
