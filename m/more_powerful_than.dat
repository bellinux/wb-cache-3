5|$|Ecuador {{is still}} at risk from earthquakes: Both intraplate (such as those in March 1987) and {{interplate}} earthquakes are possible. Intraplate seismicity poses a more formidable threat, {{as it can be}} much <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> interplate seismicity and is usually associated with landslides, subsidence, and even soil liquefaction.|$|E
5|$|The city of Chengdu is {{the capital}} of Sichuan province, and it has sub-provincial {{administrative}} status. It contains 9 districts, 4 county-level cities, and 6 counties. The mayor is Ge Honglin, and the CPC Committee Secretary (who {{is considered to be}} <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> the mayor) is Huang Xingchu.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the rifle}} corps were re-established in late 1942 and the {{previous}} organization of artillery at the corps level was reintroduced. As {{a result of the}} halting of 152mm howitzer production, the Red Army corps artillery lacked a weapon more mobile than the heavy 152 mm howitzer-gun M1937 (ML-20) (typically employed by army-level and Reserve of the Main Command artillery units), but <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> the 122 mm howitzer M1938 (M-30).|$|E

5|$|In 1933, the Pennsylvania Railroad {{decided to}} replace the P5, and {{instructed}} General Electric and Westinghouse to design an electric locomotive that was <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> the P5, capable of speeds of , have a lighter axle load and to be double-ended with a cab {{in the center of}} the carbody. Westinghouse designed the R1 #4800, and General Electric submitted the GG1, then numbered 4899.|$|E
5|$|NASA {{managers}} and engineers declared the mission a complete success. The completion {{of all the}} major objectives, {{as well as some}} that were not considered vital, upgraded the Hubble telescope to its most technologically advanced state since its launch nineteen years before and made it <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> ever. The upgrades will help Hubble to see deeper into the universe and farther into the past, closer to the time of the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|The Alaskas were officially {{funded in}} September 1940 {{along with a}} plethora of other ships {{as a part of}} the Two-Ocean Navy Act. Their role had been altered slightly: in {{addition}} to their surface-to-surface role, they were planned to protect carrier groups. Because of their bigger guns, greater size and increased speed, they would be more valuable in this role than heavy cruisers, and would provide insurance against reports that Japan was building super cruisers <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> U.S. heavy cruisers.|$|E
50|$|In general terms, diff is a <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> utility <b>than</b> comm. The simpler comm is {{best suited}} for use in scripts.|$|R

5|$|The first {{indication}} {{of a change in}} weather was the sudden collapse of the market for specialized AI hardware in 1987. Desktop computers from Apple and IBM had been steadily gaining speed and power and in 1987 they became <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> the more expensive Lisp machines made by Symbolics and others. There was no longer a good reason to buy them. An entire industry worth half a billion dollars was demolished overnight.|$|E
5|$|Truman's second inauguration was {{the first}} ever {{televised}} nationally. His second term was grueling as his opponents controlled Congress and his policy of rollback in Korea failed. The Soviet Union's atomic bomb project progressed much faster than had been expected and they detonated their first bomb on August 29, 1949. In response, on January 7, 1953, Truman announced the detonation of the first U.S. hydrogen bomb, which was much <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> the Soviets' atomic weapons.|$|E
5|$|Units can now level up in battle, {{increasing}} their capabilities. Units increase their level once for each enemy unit that they destroy. The level of each unit {{is identified as}} I, II, or Vet, with Vet being the highest level. While units with higher levels are <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> new units, the power increase is slight. Unit experience is not persistent, and the player begins each mission with new units.|$|E

5|$|While other bats {{have almost}} {{lost the ability}} to {{maneuver}} on land, vampire bats can walk, jump, and even run by using a unique, bounding gait, in which the forelimbs instead of the hindlimbs are recruited for force production, as the wings are much <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> the legs. This ability to run seems to have evolved independently within the bat lineage.|$|E
5|$|A month later, The Evil Queen appears; Rumpelstiltskin {{says that}} her {{deception}} with Belle failed, and that The Evil Queen will never be <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> him. She then tells him that {{she had nothing to}} do with Belle's actions (even though she prodded her, Belle's feelings were real) and informs him that upon Belle's return to her home, she had been shunned by her village for her association with Rumpelstiltskin and Gaston's disappearance and was subsequently imprisoned and tortured by her father. She eventually killed herself, leaping off the tower she was kept prisoner in. Rumpelstiltskin is devastated and replaces a treasured gold chalice with the chipped cup and weeps over his loss.|$|E
5|$|After his {{appointment}} as project director {{for a new}} indigenous fighter program, Tank adapted the basic Ta 183 airframe for the Nene II engine, substantially resulting in a new design that bore only a passing resemblance to its forebear. The Nene was larger, heavier and <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> the Heinkel HeS 011 turbojet that had been planned {{for use in the}} Ta 183, and therefore required a new, redesigned fuselage with a larger cross-section primarily due to the Nene's centrifugal rather than the HeS 011's axial compressor design.|$|E

5|$|All the bound {{protons and}} {{neutrons}} in an atom {{make up a}} tiny atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons. The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07fm, where A is {{the total number of}} nucleons. This is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 105fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force. At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is much <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> the electrostatic force that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.|$|E
5|$|Better Off Ted {{revolves}} around the employees of a stereotypically evil company. The company, Veridian Dynamics, experiments on its employees, twists the truth, and will stop at nothing to achieve its goals. It has been mentioned that Veridian has swayed presidential elections, created killer pandas and robots, and weaponized pumpkins, {{and that there are}} only three governments left in the world which are <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> Veridian. Although not promoted as such, and rarely the focus of storylines, the show's frequent references to futuristic technologies, killer robots, sentient computers, etc., places Better Off Ted at least partially in the science fiction genre.|$|E
5|$|In {{the battles}} of Modrica and Meçad 7,000 Ottoman forces were left {{dead on the}} {{battlefield}} along with thousands of horses. The Albanians had suffered 1,000 casualties themselves and, in their exhaustion, they refused to pursue the fleeing Ottoman forces. Hamza Pasha and his staff were ransomed to the sultan. Raimon d'Ortafà reported Skanderbeg's victory to Alfonso who received it with great exuberance. Skanderbeg's victory over a ruler even <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> Murad came as a great surprise to the Albanians. Skanderbeg's reputation among his allies was redeemed and the Dukagjini opted for a reconciliation.|$|E
30|$|From a {{practical}} point of view, strict pseudo-contractions have <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> applications <b>than</b> nonexpansive mappings do in solving inverse problems (see [14]). Therefore, {{it is important}} to develop a theory of iterative methods for strict pseudo-contractions.|$|R
50|$|The AEG C.V was a {{prototype}} two-seat biplane reconnaissance aircraft of World War I. Designed to utilise a <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> engine <b>than</b> previous AEG C-class reconnaissance aircraft, results were disappointing enough that further development was cancelled.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} days of the convention, Mason {{supported}} much of the Virginia Plan, which was introduced by Randolph on May 29. This plan would have a popularly elected lower house which would choose the members of the upper house from lists provided by the states. Most of the delegates had found the weak government under the Articles insufficient, and Randolph proposed that the new federal government should be supreme over the states. Mason agreed that the federal government should be <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> the states.|$|E
5|$|Terraforming is {{a natural}} {{outgrowth}} of colonizing an alien world. The first playable prototype was just a map generator that tested climate changes during the game. This required the designers to create a world builder program and climatic model far <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> anything they'd done before. Temperature, wind, and rainfall patterns were modeled in ways that allow players to make changes: for example, creating a ridge-line and then watching the effects. In addition to raising terrain, the player can also divert rivers, dig huge boreholes into the planet's mantle, and melt ice caps.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 26 April 1797 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{during the}} French Revolutionary Wars in which a Spanish convoy of two frigates was trapped and defeated off the Spanish town of Conil de la Frontera by British ships of the Cadiz blockade. The British vessels, the ship of the line HMS Irresistible and the Fifth-rate frigate HMS Emerald, were significantly <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> the Spanish frigates, which were on the last stage of a voyage carrying treasure from Havana, Cuba, to the Spanish fleet base of Cadiz.|$|E
5000|$|The Republic Seabee {{was built}} between 1946 and 1948, with over 1000 {{aircraft}} being sold. The type was rather underpowered {{and many were}} later fitted with <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> engines <b>than</b> the [...] Franklin 6A8 originally fitted.|$|R
