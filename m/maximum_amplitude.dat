The warning {{for the general public}} was delivered about 8 seconds after the first P wave was detected, or about 31 seconds after the earthquake occurred. However, the estimated intensities were smaller than the actual ones in some places, especially in Kanto, Koshinetsu, and Northern Tōhoku regions where the populace warning did not trigger.

2500|$|It {{have been}} found that, the {{initially}} predicted tsunami height by the tsunami warning system was lower than the actual tsunami height {{and it could be}} connected to the delayed escape of some residents.

Also, the warning system was supposed to be updated about 15 minutes after earthquake occur when calculation for moment magnitude scale completed, however thee strong quake have exceeded the measure limit of all the teleseismometer within Japan and thus it was impossible to calculate the moment magnitude based on data from those meters. The second update on the tsunami warning was released 28 minutes after the earthquake based on observation, which was reportedly unable to reach some residents due to circumstances like power cut, and observed data from off coast tidal meter were also not fully reflected in the second warning. Also, shortly after the earthquake, some wave meters have reported a fluctuation of [...] "20 centimeter" [...] and the value was broadcast across mass media and warning system, which caused some resident to underestimate the situation and even delayed or suspended their evacuation.|$|E

However, when a magnitude is more than 8, MJ is not appropriate due to the saturation of amplitude-magnitude. MW was adopted exceptionally for the official magnitude of the mainshock and the largest aftershock, although it was different from the official procedure, which will be explained in Sections 3.1 and 3.3.
