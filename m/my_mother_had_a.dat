500|$|John Albert Taylor {{was born}} in Ogden, Utah to Albert and Gaylene Taylor, who {{separated}} during his infancy. He moved several times during his youth, including a move to Colorado {{at the age of}} nine, when he was told that his father had died. According to Taylor, he was raised in Florida, where he was abused as a child and became involved in drugs by his teens. Taylor stated that he did not get along with his stepfather, a Vietnam veteran, or his mother: [...] "But she could never control me. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> lot of animosity toward my father. They alienated me for a long time. I was the whipping post." [...] At the age of 13, he stabbed his stepfather. According to court records, he repeatedly raped and sodomized his sister Laurie during his teens, and raped, and sodomized other young girls, and was committed to a sex offender program. In 1974, Taylor moved back to Ogden to live with his grandmother, but soon returned to Florida.|$|E
500|$|A {{lot of my}} {{performances}} {{have had}} fire involved, so we thought 'Heat.' Also, red {{is one of my}} favorite colors, as is gold. So then we thought of making the bottle look like it's on fire. I love antique bottles — <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> collection of them when I was growing up. I wanted something with an antique yet modern feeling. Even with my wardrobe, I always try to find things that have a little bit of something vintage, yet still timeless and classic. The bottle, I felt, was a great mixture of the two... Everything, from the bottle design to the name and the ideas for the commercials–that's me. When I commit to something, I do it 100 percent, and I've never had [...] until this project. I learned a lot of great things from the past — but I always asked myself, 'If I could have my own scent, what would it be?' I wasn't worried about deadlines. It could have taken me three, four, however many years — this was my first fragrance, and I wanted to make sure that it was something I would love forever.|$|E

"I have no capital myself, but <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> little {{property}} {{which takes}} the form of an annuity"--here Mr. Guppy's mother rolled her head as if she never could sufficiently enjoy the observation, and put her handkerchief to her mouth, and again winked at me--"and a few pounds for expenses out of pocket in conducting business will never be wanting, free of interest, which is an advantage, you know," [...] said Mr. Guppy feelingly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad of that," [...] he said. [...] "But I {{hope the}} little boy will get over this. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> very {{excellent}} account of Dr. Medlicott's skill; and you know an illness from a misadventure is not like anything constitutional." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> maid, called Barbara; [...] She was in love; and he {{she loved}} proved mad, [...] And did forsake her; {{she had a}} song of willow, [...] An old thing 'twas; but it express'd her fortune, [...] And she died singing it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you. Well, {{you must}} know that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{beautiful}} voice-- O! much more beautiful than mine. Indeed, I do not joke, so you need not laugh. It was so sweet that men were always forced to listen till she was done. They could not help it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "May I ask {{how things}} are proceeding?" [...] he said. [...] "Do your {{investigations}} point to <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>having</b> died <b>a</b> natural death--or--or must we prepare ourselves for the worst?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "That's {{what they}} gave me. I thought that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> eaten <b>a</b> chicken {{with a man}} who always goes to our home when you're not there, and sent you just the bones." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, yes,"--Jack owned he <b>had</b> the document--"and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> ordered <b>a</b> chair, and {{was coming}} to wait on Miss Lyddy," [...] he whispered piteously, as the young men lingered on the steps.|$|R
60|$|<b>MY</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> sure foreboding at {{the second}} glance, that it was Miss Betsey.

60|$|On {{the fourth}} day we {{arranged}} to make an excursion to a little waterfall in our neighborhood. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> great admiration of the place, and had often expressed a wish to possess some memorial of it.

60|$|Miss Mary. Of a {{home and}} independence. (Aside.) Poor fellow! how pale he looks! (Aloud.) Well, you see, I am more trustful than you. I will tell you MY secret; and you shall aid me with your counsel. (They sit on ledge of rocks.) Listen! <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> cousin once,--a cousin cruel, cowardly, selfish, and dissolute. She loved him, as women are apt to love such men,--loved him so that she beguiled her own husband to trust his {{fortunes}} {{in the hands of}} this wretched profligate. The husband was ruined, disgraced. The wife sought her cousin for help for her necessities. He met her with insult, and proposed that she should fly with him.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{played at}} cards every night, {{if we were}} so inclined," [...] said George, smiling; [...] "and my {{grandfather}} loved Shakspeare so much, that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> not <b>a</b> word to say against her father's favourite author." ...|$|R
6000|$|You mistake me, if {{you think}} I dislike Lord Carlisle; I respect him, [...] and might like him did I know him better.

60|$|The stains {{of travel}} washed away, my mother gave {{a sigh of}} {{satisfaction}} as she seated herself at the dinner table. As any one might guess who looked at her, she was no despiser {{of the good things}} of this life! That very night we went to the Hippodrome, where we met many old acquaintances. My own Artillery Twins were there, and kissed their hands to me as they flew gracefully over our heads towards the desired trapeze. Here, also, was the Tattooed Man, and I grasped his variegated and decorative hand with an emotion I have rarely felt. Without vanity I may say that Philippa and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> succès fou.|$|E
60|$|It {{must have}} been {{somewhat}} over a year afterward that I saw Mr. Nicholas B.--or, more correctly, that he saw me--for the last time. It was, as I have already said, {{at the time when}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> three months' leave from exile, which she was spending in the house of her brother, and friends and relations were coming from far and near to do her honour. It is inconceivable that Mr. Nicholas B. should not have been of the number. The little child a few months old he had taken up in his arms on the day of his home-coming, after years of war and exile, was confessing her faith in national salvation by suffering exile in her turn. I do not know whether he was present on the very day of our departure.|$|E
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{good deal}} of trouble with me, but I think she enjoyed it. She had none at all with my brother Henry, who was two years younger than I, and I think that the {{unbroken}} monotony of his goodness and truthfulness and obedience {{would have been a}} burden to her but for the relief and variety which I furnished in the other direction. I was a tonic. I was valuable to her. I never thought of it before, but now I see it. I never knew Henry to do a vicious thing toward me, or toward any one else--but he frequently did righteous ones that cost me as heavily. It was his duty to report me, when I needed reporting and neglected to do it myself, and he was very faithful in discharging that duty. He is [...] "Sid" [...] in [...] "Tom Sawyer." [...] But Sid was not Henry. Henry was a very much finer and better boy than ever Sid was.|$|E

5000|$|On {{same-sex}} marriage, McMullin said in 2016 that {{he believes}} in the [...] "traditional marriage {{between a man and}} a woman" [...] but he [...] "respects" [...] the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges (which found that same-sex couples <b>have</b> <b>a</b> constitutional right to marry) and thinks it is [...] "time to move on" [...] from the issue. McMullin's mother is in <b>a</b> same-sex marriage, <b>having</b> married another woman after separating from his father, and McMullin has said that [...] "As far as <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> marriage is concerned, I believe in the sanctity of traditional marriage. It is an important part of <b>my</b> faith. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> different view. That is OK. I love her very much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] thought he, [...] "if I {{do not get}} tired, I will go on {{and fill}} the second sheet, and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> double small letter. A double small letter {{will be just as}} good as a single large one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{coming to}} him. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> friend--a very noble, lofty-minded gentleman who had loved {{her with a}} great and honest love before the profligate who was my father came forward as a suitor. Recognizing in the latter--as he thought in his honest heart--a man in better case to make her happy, this gentleman I speak of went his ways. He came upon her afterwards, broken and abandoned, and he {{gathered}} up the poor shards of her shattered life, and sought with tender but unavailing hands to piece them together again. And when she died he vowed to stand my friend and to make up to me for the want I had of parents. 'Tis by his bounty that to-day I am lord of Maligny that was for generations the property of my mother's people. 'Tis by his bounty and loving care that I am what I am, and not what so easily I might have become had the seed sown by my father been allowed to put out shoots." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My father!' said Venetia, in {{a firmer}} voice, and with {{returning}} animation, yet gazing around {{her with a}} still distracted air, 'Am I with my father? The clouds clear from my brain. I remember that we met. Where was it? Was it at Arquâ? In the garden? I am with my father!' she continued in a rapid tone and with a wild smile. 'Oh! let me look on him;' and she turned round, and gazed upon Herbert with a serious scrutiny. 'Are you my father?' she continued, in a still, small voice. 'Your hair has grown grey since last I saw you; it was golden then, like mine. I know you are my father,' she added, after a pause, and in a tone almost of gaiety. 'You cannot deceive me. I know your name. They did not tell it me; I found it out myself, but it made me very ill, very; and I do not think I have ever been quite well since. You are Marmion Herbert. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> dog called Marmion, when I was a little girl, but I did not know I had a father then.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{the bane}} of my life," [...] Bathurst went on. [...] "It is my misfortune, for I will not allow it is my fault. In many things I am not a coward. I think I could face any danger if the danger were a silent one, but I cannot stand noise. The report of a gun makes me tremble all over, {{even when it is}} a blank {{cartridge}} that is fired. When I was born my father was in India. A short time before I came into the world <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> great fright. Her house in the country was broken into by burglars, who entered the room and threatened to blow out her brains if she moved; but the alarm was given, the men servants came down armed, there was a struggle in her room, pistol shots were fired, and the burglars were overpowered and captured. My mother fainted and was ill for weeks afterwards--in fact, until the time I was born; and she died a few days later, never having, the doctor said, recovered from the shock she had suffered that night.|$|E
60|$|Your {{letter and}} {{accounts}} are doubtless at S. F., and will reach me in course. My wife is no great shakes; {{she is the}} one who <b>has</b> suffered most. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> Huge Old Time; Lloyd is first chop; I so well that I do not know myself--sea-bathing, if you please, and what is far more dangerous, entertaining and being entertained by His Majesty here, who is a very fine intelligent fellow, but O, Charles! what a crop for the drink! He carries it, too, like a mountain with a sparrow on its shoulders. We calculated five bottles of champagne in three hours and a half (afternoon), and the sovereign quite presentable, although perceptibly more dignified at the end....|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> turned <b>a</b> little {{away from}} me and stood with face upturned to heaven and mutely moving lips. Out of her eyes I could see the tears slowly welling, and her tall slim figure was convulsed with sobs. I sprang to her side and caught hold of her hand.|$|R
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> {{likewise}} <b>an</b> excellent constitution. I {{never knew}} either <b>my</b> father or <b>mother</b> to <b>have</b> any sickness {{but that of}} which they died, he at eighty-nine and she at eighty-five years of age. They lie buried together at Boston, where I some years since placed a marble[23] over their grave with this inscription: ...|$|R
60|$|Instead of tiring {{yourself}} with my concerns, I should {{be glad to}} hear your plans of retirement. I suppose you {{would not like to}} be wholly shut out of society? Now I know a large village, or small town, about twelve miles off, where your family would have the advantage of very genteel society, without the hazard of being annoyed by mercantile affluence; where you would meet with men of information and independence; and where I have friends to whom I should be proud to introduce you. There are, besides, a coffee-room, assemblies, etc., etc., which bring people together. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> house there some years, and I am well acquainted with the economy of Southwell, the name of this little commonwealth. Lastly, you will not be very remote from me; and though I am the very worst companion for young people in the world, this objection would not apply to you, whom I could see frequently. Your expenses, too, would be such as best suit your inclinations, more or less, as you thought proper; but very little would be requisite to enable you to enter into all the gaieties of a country life. You could be as quiet or bustling as you liked, and certainly as well situated as on the lakes of Cumberland, unless you have a particular wish to be picturesque.|$|E
60|$|I thought Pris. {{looked a}} little confused, and {{as if she were}} sorry she had said so much on the subject at all, the instant she had betrayed so much {{intimacy}} with the Malbone genealogy; for she shrunk back, plucked a rose, and walked away smelling the flower, like one who was indisposed to say any more on the subject. A summons to breakfast, however, would otherwise have interrupted us, and no more was said about the Chainbearer, and his marvellous niece, Dus Malbone. As soon as the meal was ended, our horses were brought round, and Kate and I took our leave, Jaap having preceded us as usual, an hour or more, with our luggage. The reader is not to suppose that we always moved in the saddle, in that day; on the contrary, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> very neat chaise, in which she used to drive about the country, with a mounted postilion; my father had a phaeton, and in town we actually kept a chariot; for the union of the Mordaunt and Littlepage properties had made us very comfortable, and comfortably we lived. But young ladies liked the saddle twenty-five years ago, more than they do to-day; and Kate, being a capital horse-woman, like her mother, before her, we were often out together. It was choice, then, and not necessity, a little aided by bad roads, perhaps, that induced us to ride across to Satanstoe so often, when we wished to visit our grandmother.|$|E

I do not know whether he was present on the very day of our departure. I have already admitted that for me he is more especially the man who in his youth had eaten roast dog in the depths of a gloomy forest of snow-loaded pines. My memory cannot place him in any remembered scene. A hooked nose, some sleek white hair, an unrelated evanescent impression of a meagre, slight, rigid figure militarily buttoned up to the throat, is all that now exists on earth of Mr. Nicholas B.; only this vague shadow pursued by the memory of his grand-nephew, the last surviving human being, I suppose, of all those he had seen {{in the course of his}} taciturn life.|$|E
60|$|VIVIE [not at all pleased] Did she? Hm! <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> rather <b>a</b> {{trick of}} taking me by {{surprise}}--to see how I behave myself while she's away, I suppose.

50|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother's</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> very tragic life. Three of {{her five}} {{children}} are dead, and her husband is dead. That she is attempting to change gay people into straight people is, in my opinion, {{a way to keep}} the pain of the truth out. People wonder why I am so forthcoming with the truths that have happened in my life, and it's because the lies that I have been surrounded with and the denial that I was raised in, for better or worse, bore a child of truth and love. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> preaches to this day the opposite of that core of my life. It is no mistake that she still stands up against love. And one wonders why I'm not rushing to have her meet my children.|$|R
