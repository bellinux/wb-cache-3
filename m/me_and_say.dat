He would stop <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> 'Don't move your head like that.' And I would say, 'Like what? What do you mean?' He'd say, 'There— you're doing it again. Don't do that'." [...] Price reportedly became so upset with Reeves that he refused to watch the film's dailies.|$|E

It was originally going to be named [...] "Homer vs. the 8th Commandment", but the writers decided to include Lisa in the title because they wanted the cast {{to feel as if}} all their characters were equally represented on the show. The episode is based on the Eighth Commandment ("thou shall not steal"), {{which is one of the}} Ten Commandments. The Simpsons writer Al Jean said that [...] "whenever people come up to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> that The Simpsons is just sort of this outrageous show that has no moral center, I always point them to this , where Homer gets an illegal cable hook-up (which many people have done in real life) and suffers enormous consequences." ...|$|E

[...] Hasselhoff enjoyed his cameo: [...] "It was great fun {{and to this day}} around the world kids stop <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> 'Are you David Hasselhoff?' because I was the only human in the picture." [...] Hasselhoff said that the film gained him new fans: [...] "It's amazing - so many of the kids were so young and didn't see Baywatch and Knight Rider so I got a whole new legion of fans." ...|$|E
500|$|Aubrey {{announced}} plans for faster and cheaper movies, none of which would have a budget above $1 million, {{but many of these}} inexpensive films bombed with critics and audiences. [...] One notable success was the Richard Roundtree film Shaft, which cost $1 million and grossed around $12 million at the box office. Agent Sue Mengers said he was a very tough dealmaker. [...] "I'd rather go to bed with him than negotiate with him." [...] Upon assuming his MGM post, Aubrey almost immediately canceled production on two Julie Andrews pictures, She Loves <b>Me</b> <b>and</b> <b>Say</b> It With Music, the late 1960s fad for musicals having ended. He also clashed with David Lean, whose production of Ryan's Daughter was running overbudget, in early 1970, attempting to cancel or at least scale down the film; but Lean held too much sway for Aubrey's actions to have any effect.|$|E
500|$|In {{an attempt}} to keep his anonymity, Grohl planned to release the songs under the name Foo Fighters. It {{would be a very}} low-key release, with only 100 LP records being pressed after the {{sessions}} were finished. Grohl also went to a cassette duplication lab in Seattle and created 100 cassette copies of the session and started handing them to friends for feedback and [...] "I'd give tapes to everybody. Kids would come up to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> 'Nirvana was my favourite band' and I'd say 'well here, have this'". Eddie Vedder premiered two songs from the recording on January 8, 1995 during his Self-Pollution radio broadcast. The recordings quickly circulated amongst the music industry, which in turn created record label interest. A deal was eventually signed to Capitol Records, as president Gary Gersh was a personal friend of Grohl ever since he worked on Nirvana's label Geffen Records.|$|E

500|$|Brian Donlevy as Professor Bernard Quatermass: Donlevy reprised {{his role}} as the eponymous professor, much to the despair of Nigel Kneale, who had heavily criticised his {{interpretation}} of the role in The Quatermass Xperiment. As had been the case on The Quatermass Xperiment, Donlevy's alcoholism presented challenges for the production. Nigel Kneale recalled visiting the set one day: “He [...] was so full of whiskey he could hardly stand up. He staggered over to the set and looked dazedly around. They held up an idiot board with his lines on and he said, “What's this movie called?” and they said, “Well, it's called Quatermass 2”. He said, “I've got to say all that? There's too much talk. Cut down some of the talk”. He tried to read it and he had to have go after go after go, so crippled with drink he hardly knew who he was”. Val Guest has denied Kneale's claims, saying “So many stories have been concocted since, about how he was a paralytic. It's absolute balls, because he was not paralytic. He wasn't stone cold sober either, but he was a pro and he knew his lines”. Guest also recalled, “By after lunch he would come to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> “Give me a breakdown of the story so far. Where have I just been before this scene?” We used to feed him black coffee all morning but then we discovered he was lacing it. But he was a very professional actor and very easy to work with”.|$|E

After being drafted by the Rangers, Dickey was {{initially}} offered a signing bonus of $825,000, before a Rangers team physician saw Dickey's throwing (right) arm hanging oddly in a picture of him with other Team USA players in Baseball America. The Rangers subsequently did further evaluation of Dickey, leading to the discovery of a missing ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow joint, and reduced their offer to $75,000. [...] Dickey has been quoted as saying, [...] "Doctors look at <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> I shouldn't be able to turn a doorknob without feeling pain," [...] making his ability to pitch somewhat remarkable.|$|E

VanDerZee sometimes combined several photos in one image, for example by adding a ghostly child to an image of a wedding to suggest the couple's future, or by superimposing a funeral image upon a photograph of a dead woman to give the feeling of her eerie presence. VanDerZee said, [...] "I wanted to make the camera take what I thought should be there." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Ott {{become the}} {{ambassador}} to Japan in April 1938, Sorge had a breakfast with him everyday {{where the two}} discussed in detail German-Japanese relations, and Sorge sometimes drafted the cables that Ott sent under his name to Berlin. Ott trusted Sorge {{so much that he}} sent him out as a German courier to carry secret messages to the German consulates in Canton, Hong Kong, and Manila. Sorge himself noted about his influence in the German Embassy: [...] "They would come to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> 'we have found out such and such a thing, have you heard about it and what do you think?'". Of all of Sorge's various relationships with women, the most durable and lastingly was with a Japanese woman Hanako Ishii who tried to curb Sorge's heavy drinking and his habit of recklessly riding his motorcycle around the Japanese countryside in a manner that everyone viewed as almost suicidal.|$|E

2500|$|Ribbentrop was a {{defendant}} at the Nuremberg Trials. The Allies' International Military Tribunal convicted him on four counts: crimes against peace, deliberately planning {{a war of}} aggression, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. According to the judgment, Ribbentrop was actively involved in planning the invasions of Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. He was also {{deeply involved in the}} [...] "final solution"; as early as 1942 he had ordered German diplomats in Axis countries to hasten the process of sending Jews to death camps in the east. He supported the lynching of Allied airmen shot down over Germany, and helped to cover up the 1945 murder of Major-General Gustave Mesny, a French officer being held as a prisoner of war. He was held directly responsible for atrocities that took place in Denmark and Vichy France, since the top officials in those two occupied countries reported to him. Ribbentrop claimed that Hitler made all of the important decisions, and that he had been deceived by Hitler's repeated claims that he only wanted peace. The Tribunal rejected this argument, saying that given how closely involved Ribbentrop was with the execution of the war, [...] "he could not have remained unaware of the aggressive nature of Hitler's actions." [...] Even in prison, Ribbentrop remained loyal to Hitler: [...] "Even with all I know, if in this cell Hitler should come to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> 'Do this!', I would still do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|June 12, 2009: Both teams played {{each other}} {{for the first time at}} the new Yankee Stadium. The game had several lead changes, {{including}} Mariano Rivera giving up the go ahead run to the Mets in the 8th. In the bottom of the 9th, after Derek Jeter stole 2nd base and Mark Teixeira was intentionally walked, the Mets new closer Francisco Rodríguez (K-Rod) paired off against Alex Rodriguez (A-Rod). In what seemed a routine pop with two outs, Mets 2nd baseman and three time gold glove award winner Luis Castillo dropped the ball. Teixeira wound up scoring the winning run all the way from first on the error to give the Yankees the 9-8 victory. It would prove to be the Yankees' 7th walk off game that season and the first statistical blown save for K-Rod as a Met. After the game, injured Yankees pitcher Brian Bruney criticized K-Rod and his animated behavior on the mound to reporters. [...] " [...] couldn't have happened to a better guy on the mound, either", said Bruney. [...] "He's got a tired act. ... He gets what he deserves, man. I just don't like watching the guy pitch. I think it's embarrassing." [...] Rodriguez responded, [...] "Instead of sending a message in the paper, next time when he sees me at Citi Field, come up to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> it. Don't be sending a message to the media. I don't even know who that guy is, somewhere in Double-A and not even pitching one full season." ...|$|E

2500|$|The lyrics on {{the record}} were {{described}} by the band members as [...] "a collaborative psycho-therapy session wherein personal demons of various sizes and importance are exorcised, vilified, taken revenge upon and laid to rest." [...] Vig said they tried to deal with [...] "dark themes that I {{think a lot of}} people can relate to in some way or another", which included voyeurism, hedonism, perversion, obsession and [...] "the art of self-destruction." [...] Manson stated that even though she put together most of the songs, [...] "everybody has ideas that come to the table and I just use what I fancy. When we're working on something, the lyrics take a while to work on and [...] come to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> 'I've had these ideas, use them if you want' and if there's something I like, I'll stick it in with my own, or vice-versa. Some people come in going 'I've got this great title for a song' and I might use that." [...] Manson remarked that while the content was [...] "a lot more poppy" [...] than most of her previous work, the songs invoked the dark side of her nature, as [...] "sometimes I'm a bit wee creepy, and that definitely comes out in the music." [...] She also declared that music [...] "unlocks sensations and feelings that you keep inside, that society doesn't allow you to show", saying that the gist of a mean-spirited song like [...] "Vow" [...] is very real despite [...] "none of us hav ever really acted on those feelings". Vig added that the band was eager to exploit the contrast between words and music: [...] "The initial idea was to make this a dark lyric with a shiny, happy, pop sensibility. You could be singing this really catchy line and realize the lyrics were totally wacked." ...|$|E

Muma Gee competed in the first Imo State intercommunity beauty pageant, representing the community of Umuhu in Ngor Okpala. She came into the competition through her matrimonial union with Eke, whose heritage stems from the Umuhu people. On 1 August 2013, she was named Mrs. Ngor Okpala by first lady of Imo State, Nneoma Nkechi Okorocha, after beating off challenges from 28 other entrants. It was also made known on 23 September 2013, that Muma Gee has commenced a new recording session—possibly for Motherland—with Slim Burna and P Jaydino in the studio.
