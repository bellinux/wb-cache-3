40|$|Although the {{technology}} of refrigeration and air conditioning developed in the XX century, their origins {{can be traced back}} to the beginnings of civilization. Snow and ice were used to preserve food and to cool drinks. However, it was not until the mid XIX century that methods were elaborated to produce artificial ice and the early XX century that air conditioning was developed. Today the widespread use of this technology has necessitated the creation of vocational courses of a medium level for the assembly and maintenance of air conditioning devices, and courses of a higher level for making projects of thermal facilities. We present some didactic materials related to the history of refrigeration that could be used in vocational courses to assist students, and that could be included in a commemorative <b>commercial</b> <b>catalogue</b> in order to provide a more detailed explanation to the technician...|$|R

40|$|Propulsive {{efficiencies}} of Micro Air Vehicle propellers over {{operating range}} is playing {{very important role}} in enhancing the endurance of the MAVs. These propellers are powered by brushless mini motors whose efficiencies are low in comparison to bigger size motors and are varying over a range of operation. Generally propulsive efficiencies are evaluated by measuring the input power of drive motor and its efficiencies from <b>commercial</b> <b>catalogue.</b> Uncertainty in propulsive efficiency estimation results from the uncertainty in motor efficiencies which vary with load, speed; local heating of the miniature motors, and also compounded by uncertainty in low velocity air flow measurements. To alleviate this, novel method of simultaneous measurement of propellers shaft torque, thrust and rotational speed is configured by CSIR-NAL and procured from M/s MAGTROL SA, Switzerland along with the computer controlled data acquisition system. Wind tunnel testing in uninstalled condition, measurement techniques and data analysis method adapted has yielded realistic assessment of propulsive efficiencies of mini propellers used in micro air vehicles.

30|$|The gall {{extracts}} chromatographic profiles {{are very}} interesting, where HPLC–ESI–MS clearly shows {{the presence of}} a dominant fraction of polygalloyl esters of glucose, Fig.  7. The results obtained from the aqueous solution of commercial tannic acid surprised us, and for that reason, the chromatogram obtained is presented in Fig.  7. We were expecting a maximum of two peaks, corresponding to some fraction of gallic acid and a broad band for the isomers of decagalloylglucoses [39]. Instead, the chromatographic profile is much more complex than the gall extracts obtained following fifteenth to seventeenth centuries recipes. Definitively, commercial tannic acid cannot be described, as depicted in the <b>commercial</b> <b>catalogues,</b> as penta-m-digalloyl-glucose (meta-depsidic 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 pentakis-O-digalloyl-β-d-glucopyranose), Additional file 1 : Figure S 1, and it is not suitable for preparing a reference medieval iron-gall ink. As described by Quideau et al. [39], commercial tannic acid is in fact “a complex and varying mixture of different gallotannins and simpler galloylglucoses”. This could have been anticipated as tannic acid is described in literature as being extracted from gall-nuts “by boiling ground-up nuts in acidic aqueous solution” [40]. In the future, we plan to study “true” iron-decagalloylglucoses complexes, but we anticipate it will not be an easy task since these molecular structures equilibrate into meta/para-depsidic isomeric mixtures in solution [39].|$|R

40|$|The first visual {{essay on}} fashion and modernism in fascist Italy. Drawn up in a {{fascinating}} and original manner the book investigates the active role of fashion in the affirmation {{of a modern}} aesthetic, between processes of spreading international culture and the visions induced by the regime. The result of wide ranging research, Fashion at the Time of Fascism explores and compares a broad variety of Italian sources: women’s magazines, fashion magazines, cinema and society life, exhibition and <b>commercial</b> <b>catalogues,</b> books and magazines on dressmaking techniques, design and architecture, plus publications by businesses and government departments. The book is a close-knit montage of images and texts that follow the rhythms and rituals of lifestyles in the modern Italian day, developed around four key concepts: Measurement, Model, Mark and Parade. From obsession with the exact measurement of bodies, garments and time {{to the creation of}} icons and models of modernity; from the construction of a national fashion system to the spectacular dimension of fashion shows and fascist rituals. An outline of the key figures and the fundamental steps of Italian fashion from the 1920 s to the early 1940 s, the crucial themes of modernism and the relationship between glamour and the fascist regime’s choreographies. Fashion at the Time of Fascism includes a selection of texts by authors of the day and a wide variety of original critical contributions dealing with and contextualising the course of iconographic development...|$|R

40|$|With {{this review}} article, {{we intend to}} {{demonstrate}} the importance of Computerized Tomography (CT) in healthcare quality and safety. The concept of safety in CT is wider than for general healthcare. Safe healthcare provided using CT must include diagnostic image quality and reliability, as {{this is the only}} way to ensure diagnostic accuracy. The images must be acquired with the most adequate protocols available and with the lowest achievable radiation dose. In this article we will focus primarily on the concepts of dose, since this variable strongly affects the image quality and the consequent diagnostic accuracy. In methodological terms, 73 papers and 6 catalogues issued by the manufacturers of CT equipment, that included the keywords low dose, ultra-low dose and dose reduction were analysed. After review of these articles we found that about 82 % are chest exams, namely the lungs. The remaining were subdivided mainly by studies of the sinuses, heart and bone segments. After this review we selected the only 10 articles that present the keywords and simultaneously quantify the dose reduction. Given the lack of precision associated with these terms, introduced mainly by <b>commercial</b> <b>catalogues</b> of different equipment brands, we intend to demonstrate that the concepts low dose and ultra-low dose are wrapped in unclear marketing strategies, without a strict and unambiguous definition of what is the effective dose. We propose that these concepts should be clearly defined and a precise indication of the effective dose reduction value should be compared to the default value (standard diagnostic dose) by exam region. Therefore, it is demonstrated that there is no concrete definition of what low dose or ultra-low dose are. These slogans cannot be used until they are not holistically defined, as well as the correspondent dose reduction value...|$|R
