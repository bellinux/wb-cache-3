5|$|Former World Bank Chief Economist {{and former}} Chairman of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers Joseph E. Stiglitz {{referred}} {{in the late}} 1990s to a growing consensus {{that something is wrong}} with a system having the capacity to impose high costs on a great {{number of people who are}} hardly even participants in international financial markets, neither speculating on international investments nor borrowing in foreign currencies. He argued that foreign crises have strong worldwide repercussions due in part to the phenomenon of <b>moral</b> <b>hazard,</b> particularly when many multinational firms deliberately invest in highly risky government bonds in anticipation of a national or international bailout. Although crises can be overcome by emergency financing, employing bailouts places a heavy burden on taxpayers living in the afflicted countries, and the high costs damage standards of living. Stiglitz has advocated finding means of stabilizing short-term international capital flows without adversely affecting long-term foreign direct investment which usually carries new knowledge spillover and technological advancements into economies.|$|E
40|$|Securitization is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most important financial development in recent history. It offer the benefits of improving returns on capital, lowering borrowing costs, diversifying risks, increasing secondary market liquidity and increasing availability of credit for mortgage borrowers. However, many parties blamed the <b>moral</b> <b>hazards</b> in the securitization of mortgage loans as the key factor contributing to the recent US financial crisis of 2007 - 2008. To investigate the claim, we used the case studies of securitization of mortgage loans in US as our base and compare it with the experience of Malaysia. Premised on the literature review findings and the results of the case studies, we find supports that securitization of mortgage loans did create <b>moral</b> <b>hazards</b> and could not find evidence that proves otherwise. We conclude that securitization of mortgage loans did create <b>moral</b> <b>hazards.</b> However, the level of <b>moral</b> <b>hazards</b> experienced by the US and Malaysia differ. The differences were attributed to, amongst others, the strength of the underwriting standards, the complexities of securities and the strength of regulations in the two countries. We also conclude that the present of <b>moral</b> <b>hazards</b> did not preclude the fact that securitization provides benefits to the players and the economy, particularly when developed in the context of well-aligned incentives and oversight...|$|R

40|$|Building {{information}} modeling (BIM) {{plays an}} important role in furthering value-creation of construction projects by advocating the inter-firm cooperation. When implementing BIM, however, individual firms inherently safeguard their self-interests regardless of the fact that inter-firm cooperation might reap joint BIM benefits for a project overall, which epitomizes a typical problem of <b>moral</b> <b>hazards</b> in project-based organizations. This paper develops an outcome-linked benefit sharing model that considers sharing joint BIM benefits among stakeholders including designers, contractors, and clients for tracking <b>moral</b> <b>hazards</b> therein. By modeling stakeholders' behaviors as evolutionary games within a principal–agent formalism, it has been deducted that (1) designers/contractors could be incentivized to cooperate had each stakeholder received a share higher than the quotient of BIM costs over value-creation in the design/construction phase; and (2) how joint BIM benefits can be more than noncooperation outcomes is key for clients to support BIM implementation...|$|R
25|$|<b>Moral</b> <b>hazard</b> is the {{prospect}} that a party insulated from risk may behave differently from the way it would behave if it were fully exposed to the risk. A person's belief that {{they are responsible for}} the consequences of their own actions is an essential aspect of rational behavior. An investor must balance the possibility of making a return on their investment with the risk of making a loss – the risk-return relationship. A <b>moral</b> <b>hazard</b> can occur when this relationship is interfered with, often via government policy.|$|E

In this paper we have tried to evaluate Rashtriya Swasthaya Bima Yojana (RSBY), an innovative mass level micro heath insurance initiative of the Indian Government that attempts to eradicate the healthcare problems of poor people. The results of the study shows that RSBY has helped to improve health outcomes of the poor population but, at the same time, the behavior of poor families towards the utilization of health care has also changed (a symptom caused by the presence of <b>moral</b> <b>hazards).</b> However, this changing behavior in the poor is morally and socially good and represents a step towards their attempt to improve their own living standard...|$|R

25|$|Insurance can {{influence}} the probability of losses through <b>moral</b> <b>hazard,</b> insurance fraud, and preventive steps by the insurance company. Insurance scholars have typically used <b>moral</b> <b>hazard</b> {{to refer to the}} increased loss due to unintentional carelessness and insurance fraud to refer to increased risk due to intentional carelessness or indifference. Insurers attempt to address carelessness through inspections, policy provisions requiring certain types of maintenance, and possible discounts for loss mitigation efforts. While in theory insurers could encourage investment in loss reduction, some commentators have argued that in practice insurers had historically not aggressively pursued loss control measures—particularly to prevent disaster losses such as hurricanes—because of concerns over rate reductions and legal battles. However, since about 1996 insurers have begun to take {{a more active role in}} loss mitigation, such as through building codes.|$|E
40|$|The Ministry of Public Health has {{implemented}} {{increasingly complex}} payment schemes {{to cope with}} the internal brain drain situation among certain categories of health personnel. Non-private-practice allowances have been given to medical doctors, dentists and pharmacists since 1993 and a fee-for-service scheme for extra-office hour practices started since 1994. This research is to evaluate the impact of the fee-for-service payment on productivity and quality of care and to consider any resultant <b>moral</b> <b>hazards</b> amongs health providers. Qualitative research techniques, i. e. focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were carried out in 4 provinces. This was complemented by a before and after case-review to compare quality of care provided to 3 tracer conditions in 5 hospitals. A postal, self-administered questionnaire survey was carried out in 17 provinces to study attitudes towards fee-for service pay amongst doctors, dentists, pharmacists and nurses. As expected, a fee-for-service payment increased productivity among procedure-based health services. Quality of care could be improved by the shortening of waiting time and length of stay. <b>Moral</b> <b>hazards</b> of providers occurred in various ways, by delaying of services to after office hours, increasing the lists of patients to be seen, etc. The management system played a minimal role in safeguarding medical ethics. It is recommended that payments to health personnel should be simplified to achieve efficiency objectives. There should be a more stringent measure to manage non-private-practice allowances to achieve quality of services. Hospital management should play a more active role to increase hospital efficiency, quality of services as well as to limit <b>moral</b> <b>hazards</b> from the fee-for-service payment...|$|R

40|$|Collaborative {{knowledge}} {{creation is}} important for firms to gain new competitive advantages, but knowledge outgoing spillover harms their existing competitive advantages, which puts them into a dilemma when investing R&D resources. This study formalizes and investigates this dilemma using the Stackelberg leader-follower framework. Through our analyses, we find that, (1) current knowledge creation efforts and prior knowledge are substitutable in collaborative knowledge creation, and through controlling the ratio of current knowledge creation efforts to prior knowledge invested, the leader and the follower can gain benefits from collaboration and restrict knowledge outgoing spillover simultaneously; (2) because the leader invests resources first and faces <b>moral</b> <b>hazards,</b> it has the incentives to participate in collaborative knowledge creation only when its benefits from collaborative knowledge creation fruits and knowledge incoming spillover are bigger {{than those of the}} follower, and the more <b>moral</b> <b>hazards</b> it confronts, the more it demands; (3) the leader and the follower invest resources at ratios consistent with the benefits and costs the resources bring to them if they can determine the amount, or the collaboration is unstable.

25|$|In the United States, {{economists and}} {{consumer}} advocates generally consider insurance to be worthwhile for low-probability, catastrophic losses, {{but not for}} high-probability, small losses. Because of this, consumers are advised to select high deductibles and to not insure losses which would not cause a disruption in their life. However, consumers have shown a tendency to prefer low deductibles and to prefer to insure relatively high-probability, small losses over low-probability, perhaps due to not understanding or ignoring the low-probability risk. This is associated with reduced purchasing of insurance against low-probability losses, and may result in increased inefficiencies from <b>moral</b> <b>hazard.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{advantage}} of index-based insurance {{is that it}} can potentially be delivered at lower cost. A significant barrier that hinders uptake of claim-based insurance is the high transaction cost for searching for prospective policyholders, negotiating and administering contracts, verifying losses and determining payouts. Index insurance eliminates the loss verification step, thereby mitigating a significant transaction cost. A second {{advantage of}} index-based insurance is that, because it pays an indemnity based on the reading of an index rather than individual losses, it eliminates much of the fraud, <b>moral</b> <b>hazard</b> and adverse selection, which are common in classical claim-based insurance. A further advantage of index insurance is that payments based on a standardized and indisputable index also allow for a fast indemnity payment. The indemnity payment could be automated, further reducing transaction costs.|$|E

25|$|Corporate {{governance}} {{mechanisms and}} controls {{are designed to}} reduce the inefficiencies that arise from <b>moral</b> <b>hazard</b> and adverse selection. There are both internal monitoring systems and external monitoring systems. Internal monitoring can be done, for example, by one (or a few) large shareholder(s) {{in the case of}} privately held companies or a firm belonging to a business group. Furthermore, the various board mechanisms provide for internal monitoring. External monitoring of managers' behavior, occurs when an independent third party (e.g. the external auditor) attests the accuracy of information provided by management to investors. Stock analysts and debt holders may also conduct such external monitoring. An ideal monitoring and control system should regulate both motivation and ability, while providing incentive alignment toward corporate goals and objectives. Care should be taken that incentives are not so strong that some individuals are tempted to cross lines of ethical behavior, for example by manipulating revenue and profit figures to drive the share price of the company up.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the late}} colonial period, Massachusetts {{leveraged}} its strong seafaring tradition, advanced shipbuilding industry, {{and access to the}} oceans to make the U.S. the pre-eminent whaling nation in the world by the 1830s. Whale oil was in demand chiefly for lamps. By the 1750s whaling in Nantucket had become a highly lucrative deep-sea industry, with voyages extending for years at a time and with vessels traveling as far as South Pacific waters. The British Navy captured most of the whalers during the revolution, {{but at the same time}} many whalers refitted out as privateers against the British. Whaling recovered after the war as New Bedford became the center. Whalers took greater economic risks to turn major profits: expanding their hunting grounds and securing foreign and domestic workforces for the Pacific. Investment decisions and financing arrangements were set up so that managers of whaling ventures shared their risks by selling some equity claims but retained a substantial portion due to <b>moral</b> <b>hazard</b> considerations. As a result, they had little incentive to consider the correlation between their own returns and those of others in planning their voyages. This stifled diversity in whaling voyages and increased industry-wide risk. After 1860 kerosene replaced whale oil—concurrent with the devastation of the whaling fleet by Confederate commerce raiders—and the entrepreneurs shifted to manufacturing.|$|E
