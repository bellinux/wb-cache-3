25|$|Langer impresses <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{has proven}} {{himself as a}} {{consistent}} batsmen {{over the past few}} years. I've always believed that it takes 3-4 years to prove yourself as a Shield batsman, and Langer has achieved that. He is more of a grafting batsman than any of his rivals and that should definitely count in his favour, given the current state of Australian batting. He probably doesn't have as much natural ability as some others around, but he has proved that he can make best use of what he has got. He's prepared to work hard, and has tightened his game a lot since he came into first class cricket. His ability to get his head down and his tight defence will both be strong assets in England.|$|E

In April 2014, Carey confirmed that she and Q-Tip had worked together on a song which was yet to be mixed in {{an interview}} with Radio.com. Of the collaboration, Carey said [...] "He's angry with <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> thinks that I didn't allow him to do his mix, but really it's okay. He loves me, we're going to make this work. And that's good because it's one of my favorite songs. I'm going to call him soon... I think we need to get that ready." [...] She also stated that {{it was the first time}} they had worked together since composing [...] "Honey" [...] for Carey's sixth studio album, Butterfly (1997).|$|E
500|$|Volk {{enrolled}} at the University of Michigan in 1963. His decision to attend Michigan rather than Ohio State was influenced by family ties, including Bob Chappuis, who was Volk's uncle and {{finished second in the}} Heisman Trophy voting while playing for the undefeated 1947 Wolverines. Volk noted:"I had all these stories growing up. He [...] was my hero, so I always wanted to go to Michigan. ... And I didn't like Woody [...] anyway. It was just my Grandpa telling <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> didn't like Woody, and he hoped Woody would choke on his Thanksgiving turkey. ... Because of Uncle Bob going to Michigan, that's where I wanted to go. You know, I loved the helmets, loved the uniforms. I said 'Hey, if I could just sit on the bench, that's all I care about.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Thousands of fans braved cold {{temperatures}} on January 24 for {{a public}} visitation at the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis, where Musial lay in state, dressed in his trademark cardinal-red blazer and with a harmonica in his lapel pocket, flanked by a Navy honor guard. A private funeral Mass was held on Saturday, January 26, 2013, at the New Cathedral in St. Louis, televised locally by KTVI and KPLR as well as Fox Sports Midwest on pay-television. New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who in his first episcopal post served as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Saint Louis, was the principal celebrant, and Knoxville's Bishop Richard F. Stika, Musial's former parish priest, was the homilist. Bob Costas gave the principal eulogy, calling him [...] "the genuine hero who as the years and decades passed, and disillusionment came from other directions, never once let us down", and quoting fellow Cooperstown honoree Mickey Mantle, who once said that Musial [...] "was a better player than <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was a better man than me".|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} shot on March 12, 2010 in Los Angeles, {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler. Mandler previously worked with Drake {{on the video}} for his collaboration with Mary J. Blige, [...] "The One". It premiered on VEVO on April 12, 2010. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, when asked about how the connection came about, Mandler said, [...] "I’m {{a big fan of}} Drake and I was really excited when he called me about doing it, and really put a lot into making it special and capturing what I think is an image he hasn’t had yet. Here’s a guy whose lyrical presence does not equal his visual presence yet, by any means. That’s something that he and I spoke a lot about. He felt strongly that nobody had really captured him, and some of the videos that had been done were less iconic than he would like to be represented as." [...] On Drake and the song he said, [...] "It’s so refreshing that he’s confident, but he’s not arrogant. I think that dimensionality is so important in a genre that is very one note with words like “bravado” and “swagger” and “arrogance” and “promiscuity.” Here’s a guy that’s finally putting a duality to the words and saying, “Yeah, I have all that and I do all that, but I’m also somebody that’s asking, is that what I should be doing with my life?" [...] When asked of the concept of the [...] "Over" [...] video, Mandler said that it was something that would not be expected. Mandler explained, [...] "Drake and I were very conscious about trying to push the limits and trying to push things forward. He came to <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> wanted to throw away the conventions of a medium, and take chances and be daring and take certain themes that are relevant to him and try to visualize them in not the obvious way".|$|E

Marc Cherry has expressed bemusement at this, saying, [...] "to young people, Andrew is something of a role model which is a little appalling to <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> something of a sociopath!"

2500|$|MacNeish was {{constantly}} calling {{for others to}} question his conclusions and improve his methods to further advance the science of archeology {{and its ability to}} speak to society’s needs. [...] As a result, his greatest legacy is probably his influence on and encouragement of students, other archaeologists and professionals he worked with. [...] One of these students, Barry Rolett, recalls how “MacNeish encouraged and invested his time in students like <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> loved to share the excitement of archaeology” and “led by example and he used his considerable influence more to help others than for his own personal gain”.|$|E

2500|$|The {{beginnings}} of a Mascis–Barlow détente started in the mid-'90s when Mascis began showing up at Sebadoh shows. [...] "I think {{he was kind of}} aware of how much shit I was talking about him, but I don't think he really ever pursued any of it. One of the things that really triggered this, for me to finally just go, 'Hey, you know, maybe this could work,' is when I realized that maybe J wasn't really holding any kind of grudge against <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> didn't like me. I was thinking, maybe he just didn't realize what he had done, or maybe he wasn't really aware of how much he'd actually hurt me. And when I started to realize that, he kind of became more human to me," [...] Barlow noted in a 2005 interview.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding The Thing, by John Carpenter, I've asked him, {{as he was}} {{preparing}} some electronic music with an assistant to edit on the film, [...] "Why did you call me, {{if you want to}} do it on your own?" [...] He surprised me, he said - [...] "I got married to your music. This is why I've called you." [...] I was quite amazed, he called <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had my music at his wedding. Then when he showed me the film, later when I wrote the music, we didn't exchange ideas. He ran away, nearly ashamed of showing it to me. I wrote the music on my own without his advice. Naturally, as I had become quite clever since 1982, I've written several scores relating to my life. And I had written one, which was electronic music. And [...] took the electronic score.|$|E

With 100 meters to go I wanted to quit, but I did one more click down on my gears and I just counted the pedal strokes to get me to the finish. This hurt worse than I’ve ever hurt before." [...] She also felt sorry for Evelyn Stevens who missed a place on the podium by 0.04 seconds. [...] "It's a very bittersweet feeling for me.

2500|$|Creative and {{personal}} tensions between Mould and Hart intensified when Mould began overseeing {{most of the}} band's managerial duties following the suicide of manager David Savoy {{on the eve of}} the band's 1987 tour in support of the double album, [...] In September 2006, Hart told Britain's Q magazine, [...] "I take full responsibility for [...] suicide. It was a direct result of the pressure of working for Bob and <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was being forced into a two-faced situation." [...] Mould called the suicide [...] "the beginning of the end." [...] The band dissolved after a show in Columbia, Missouri, on the band's 1987 tour. Hart was trying to quit heroin using a supply of methadone, but the bottle had leaked. Hart played the show, but Mould and Norton were concerned Hart would be unable to play the remaining shows due to withdrawal. Hart insisted he could perform, but Mould had already cancelled the dates. Hart quit the band four days later. [...] Mould has said that the breakup was about [...] "three people going their separate ways," [...] referring to Hart's drug use and new relationship, Norton's recent marriage and new business, and Mould having quit a lifelong drinking habit.|$|E

2500|$|St. Elsewheres series finale {{featured}} momentous {{changes for}} several main characters, including the departures of Drs. Fiscus and Morrison {{and the death}} of Dr. Auschlander, as well as the return of Dr. Westphall to an active leadership role at St. Eligius after Ecumena agrees to sell the hospital back to the Boston archdiocese, as Dr. Gideon is set to move on to another hospital in San Jose, California. [...] The finale is more known for its provocative final scene: Westphall and his son Tommy Westphall (played by Chad Allen), who has autism, are seen in Dr. Auschlander's office watching snow falling outside. The image cuts to an exterior shot of the hospital. At that moment, Tommy and Daniel Auschlander are seen in an apartment building, with Tommy playing with a snow globe. Donald arrives home from a day of work, and {{it is clear from the}} uniform he wears and the dialog in this scene that he works in construction. [...] "Auschlander" [...] is revealed to be Donald's father, and thus Tommy's grandfather. Donald laments to his father, [...] "I don't understand this autism thing, Pop. Here's my son. I talk to him. I don't even know if he can hear <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> sits there, all day long, in his own world, staring at that toy. What's he thinking about?" [...] As Tommy shakes the snow globe, he is told by his father to come and wash his hands for dinner. Donald places the snow globe on the family's television set and walks into the kitchen with Tommy and Auschlander; as they leave the room, the camera closes in on the snow globe—which holds a replica of St. Eligius.|$|E

She appeared on stage backed just by her pianist while [...] "special effects were limited to a shower of glitter and Adele's own tears, as she almost broke down delivering her lovelorn plea to an ex-boyfriend" [...] as stated by Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph. Speaking on the ITV2 after show, Adele explained why she had cried at the end of the performance saying, [...] "I was really emotional by the end because I'm quite overwhelmed by everything anyway, and then I had a vision of my ex, of him watching me at home and he's going to be laughing at <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> knows I'm crying because of him, with him thinking, 'Yep, she's still wrapped around my finger'. Then everyone stood up, so I was overwhelmed." [...] A writer of Daily Mirror said that [...] "Adele stole the show [...] with her praised performance of Someone Like You." [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph chose the song as a highlight on the show saying that Adele knocked [...] "everyone for six with no bells and whistles, just a piano, her gorgeous voice and a monster song, Someone Like You."
