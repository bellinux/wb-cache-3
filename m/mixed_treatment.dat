Background and aims Mixing effects during litter decomposition could occur between two or more different litter species because of the potential nutrient transfer. However, evidence of mixing effects is variable and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using a three-year decomposition experiment, we aim to examine for the effects of litter mixing and position on decomposition rates and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) dynamics. Methods We studied litter decomposition of Stipa krylovii (Sk) and Astragalus galactites (Ag), two dominant species with contrasting litter quality, in a typical steppe of northern China in both single decomposition and three <b>mixing</b> <b>treatments.</b> The three <b>mixing</b> <b>treatments</b> included thorough <b>mixing</b> (Sk-Ag), Ag over Sk (Ag/Sk), and Sk over Ag (Sk/Ag). Results Both the Sk-Ag and the Sk/Ag mixture had negative mixing effects on the mass loss of the litter mixture, while the Ag/Sk mixture had a neutral mixing effect. The percent mass loss was higher when the litter species was placed at the top (25. 0 and 51. 9 % of mass remaining for Ag and Sk, respectively) than at the bottom (38. 3 and 61. 8 % of mass remaining for Ag and Sk, respectively). The Sk/Ag mixture had negative effects on the release of N while all three <b>mixing</b> <b>treatments</b> had positive effects on the release of P. Conclusions Our results indicate that: (1) <b>mixing</b> <b>treatments</b> can induce different mixing effects; (2) environmental factors likely {{play an important role in}} controlling the mixing effect; and (3) litter-mixtures have different non-additive effects on N and P, which may further increase the heterogeneity of N and P availability as the two litter species may fall differentially in terms of space and time...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the manner in which a Japanese medical {{regulation}} affects equity in health care within an economic framework. The regulation is termed “the ban on <b>mixed</b> <b>treatment.</b> ” <b>Mixed</b> <b>treatment</b> is the mixed use of treatments covered by public health insurance as well as those not covered by such insurance in the course of treating an illness. In principle, the Japanese Health Ministry bans <b>mixed</b> <b>treatment.</b> In order to examine the effect of <b>mixed</b> <b>treatment</b> on equity in health care, we explain the background of Japanese <b>mixed</b> <b>treatment.</b> Thereafter, we introduce a simple economic model and provide suggestions regarding the behavior of patients under the ban rule. Based on the theoretical model, we simulate the behavior of patients using questionnaire data and analyze the results from various perspectives. Here, we create data using the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM). The results suggest that lifting the ban could reduce differences in treatments among income/asset class but would make payment for health care regressive slightly. The results also suggest that the behavior of patients is different even within the same income/asset class, and there are other factors for receiving uninsured treatment besides capacity to pay.

It also aids in clinical and public health decision-making. However, {{in the absence of}} head-to-head randomized trials (RCTs), determining the relative effectiveness of interventions is challenging. Several methodological options are now available. We aimed to determine the comparative validity of the adjusted indirect comparisons of RCTs with the <b>mixed</b> <b>treatment</b> comparison approach. Methods Using systematic searching, we identified all meta-analyses evaluating more than 3 interventions for a similar disease state with binary outcomes. We abstracted data on each clinical trial including population n and outcomes. We conducted fixed effects meta-analysis of each intervention versus mutual comparator and then applied the adjusted indirect comparison. We conducted a <b>mixed</b> <b>treatment</b> meta-analysis on all trials and compared the point estimates and 95 % confidence/credible intervals (CIs/CrIs) to determine important differences. Results We included data from 7 reviews that met our inclusion criteria, allowing a total of 51 comparisons. According to the a priori consistency rule, we found 2 examples where the analytic comparisons were statistically significant using the <b>mixed</b> <b>treatment</b> comparison over the adjusted indirect comparisons and 1 example where this was vice versa. We found 6 examples where the direction of effect differed according to the indirect comparison method chosen and we found 9 examples where the confidence intervals were importantly different between approaches. Conclusion In most analyses, the adjusted indirect comparison yields estimates of relative effectiveness equal to the <b>mixed</b> <b>treatment</b> comparison. In less complex indirect comparisons, where all studies share a mutual comparator, both approaches yield similar benefits. As comparisons become more complex, the <b>mixed</b> <b>treatment</b> comparison may be favoured. </p...|$|E

RESULTS:We mixed cells from both species in equal proportions, and then we analyzed 198 individual fruiting bodies, which always had either a D. discoideum or D. purpureum phenotype (D. discoideum- 98, D. purpureum- 100). Fifty percent of the fruiting bodies that looked like D. discoideum and 22 % of the fruiting bodies that looked like D. purpureum were chimeric, though the majority of spores in any given fruiting body belonged to one species (D. discoideum fruiting bodies- 0. 85 +/- 0. 03, D. purpureum fruiting bodies- 0. 94 +/- 0. 02).

MethodsWe conducted a <b>mixed</b> <b>treatment</b> comparisons network meta-analysis estimating the effects of aprotinin and alternative agents in reducing blood loss during surgery. We implemented a combination of direct and indirect evidence in <b>mixed</b> <b>treatment</b> comparisons and estimated relative effects for different agents on all-cause mortality {{and return to the}} operating room for bleeding and conducted a supportive analysis of the effects of different agents with only directly randomized trials. ResultsMixed treatment analysis of 88 trials randomizing 15, 528 patients to 1 of 3 antifibrinolytic agents demonstrated no difference in mortality between placebo and antifibrinolytic agents. Analysis of aprotinin versus tranexamic acid and ε-aminocaproic acid in 17 and 6 trials, respectively and tranexamic acid versus ε-aminocaproic acid in 5 trials demonstrated no difference in mortality between treatment allocations. All agents were superior to placebo in reducing reexploration for bleeding, with aprotinin numerically superior: aprotinin odds ratio, 2. 6 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 9 - 3. 7); tranexamic acid odds ratio, 1. 79 (1. 2 - 2. 9), and ε-aminocaproic acid odds ratio, 2. 4 (1. 3 - 6. 6). ConclusionsThis <b>mixed</b> <b>treatment</b> comparisons meta-analysis demonstrates no increased mortality risk with aprotinin versus other antifibrinolytic agents. All agents were superior to placebo in reducing reexploration for bleeding after adult cardiac surgery...|$|E
30|$|When {{grown by}} itself, V. {{americana}} aboveground biomass {{did not differ}} among soil or fertilizer treatments, likely due to its ability to fix nitrogen. Growth of M. perforata was directly related to soil nitrogen, and it had the greatest increase in biomass with fertilization. Growth and biomass of G. boreale was less than the other species, and it had the highest mortality in the nitrogen-poor soil. When grown together, the proportional biomass of M. perforata and V. americana varied with soil treatment such that M. perforata was dominant in the high-nitrogen forest floor-mineral <b>mix</b> <b>treatment</b> while V. americana was dominant in the low-nitrogen peat-mineral mix.|$|R
30|$|Detailed {{information}} on the functionalization of the TiO 2 nanoparticles and preparation of the PLA/TiO 2 nanocomposites has been reported [16]. G-TiO 2 nanofillers were prepared by grafting lactic acid oligomer onto anatase surface. PLA/TiO 2 nanocomposites were prepared by melt blending via a corotating twin-screw extruder. Pure PLA was subjected to same <b>mixing</b> <b>treatment</b> so as {{to have the same}} thermal history as nanocomposites. The samples with 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 8.0, and 15.0 [*]wt%[*]g-TiO 2 were prepared and labeled as PLA, PLA/TiO 2 – 0.5, PLA/TiO 2 – 1, PLA/TiO 2 – 2, PLA/TiO 2 – 5, PLA/TiO 2 – 8, and PLA/TiO 2 – 15 nanocomposites.|$|R
40|$|Nocturia is a {{widespread}} condition that can negatively impact quality of sleep and overall health. This condition is multifactorial in nature and is best approached through the analysis of frequency volume charts. Through these charts, clinicians may classify each individual case of nocturia into one of four distinct categories: global polyuria, nocturnal polyuria, reduced bladder capacity, and <b>mixed.</b> <b>Treatments</b> should then be tailored to each individual based upon the category of their nocturia. In some cases, appropriate therapy will consist of behavioral modification techniques or addressing underlying systemic diseases. In other cases, medical therapy may be necessary, but, to date, medications have shown limited efficacy at treating nocturia...|$|R
