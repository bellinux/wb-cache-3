40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Milking</b> <b>performance</b> of cows {{subjected}} to electrical current during milking and two common milking machine problems were documented. The first experiment used 32 cows in a 2 Ü 2 factorial design with exposure to 1 mA (rms, 60 Hz) of electrical current {{from front to}} back hooves during milking and a pulsation failure (no massage phase) as treatments. A second experiment used 16 cows in a 2 Ü 2 factorial design with exposure to 1 mA (rms, 60 Hz) of electrical current {{from front to back}} hooves during milking and excessively aged milking machine liners as treatments. The response measures for both experiments were milk yield, average milk flow rate, maximum milk flow rate, cow activity, and strip yield. The main effect of current exposure was not statistically significant for any of the response variables. The main effect of pulsation failure was significant for cow activity (5. 8 fewer weight shifts during a milking). The main effect of aged liners was significant for milk yield (2. 2 kg increase), average flow rate (0. 3 kg/min reduction), maximum flow rate (1. 2 kg/min reduction), and liner slips (26 more per milking). The significance of some interactive effects appeared to indicate that current exposure had a mitigating effect on the changes caused by the milking machine problems. These interactions were not consistent across experiments and in some cases were highly influenced by a few observations. Further investigation is warranted before drawing any firm conclusions regarding these interactive effects. This study adds further evidence to the body of literature showing that exposure to low–level step potential resulting in < 1 mA rms of 60 Hz electrical current during milking is not a cause of cow discomfort or poor <b>milking</b> <b>performance...</b>|$|R

The aim of this Diploma work was to examine lactation course and level as well as reproduction of high-performance Czech pied diary cows with regards to their genetic base. The diary cows (190 pieces) on lactation within 27 th March 2008 [...] 13 th June 2008 were examined. The examined cows were divided into three groups based on number of their lactation. These groups with cows on 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd lactation were further divided with regards to their genetic base into herd groups registered as C 1 and C 2. The sub-herd group C 100 was isolated from C 1 herd group. To each lactation group, 2 [...] 3 bulls were assigned based on {{the highest number of}} daughters in specific lactation group. Minimum criterion for bull assignment to lactation group was set on at least 5 daughters in the group. Reproduction performance was examined in these groups. The <b>milk</b> <b>performance</b> was evaluated based on 305 days usage, lactation curve persistence index and the lactation curve course in individual groups.

40|$|For {{many years}} the {{application}} of feed enzymes to monogastric farm animals such as pigs and poultry has been utilized for purposes such as {{the reduction of the}} anti-nutritive effects of NSP or to enable a better utilization of animal feed. In the present study, the impact of a supplementation of a cellulase and an α-amylase on some performance parameters of dairy cows were examined. The trial was conducted on a commercial dairy farm and on a total of 416 animals divided into two groups (209 test- and 207 control-animals). Supplementation of the enzymes started on day 21 a. p. in both groups and continued for a total of 150 days in the test group while in the control group supplementation was discontinued after calving. The enzymes were separately sprayed on the total mixed ration (TMR) right before feeding. Study parameters included <b>milk</b> <b>performance</b> and milk composition, body condition (Back Fat Thickness-(BFT) measuring 56, 28 days a. p. and 3, 28, 56, 98, 140 days p. p.), serum concentration of bilirubin, cholesterol, urea, aspartat-amino transferase, non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and ß-OH-butyrate (8 days a. p. and 3, 28, 56, 98, 140 days p. p.), reproduction parameters and the incidence of parturient paresis, dislocation of the abomasum and mastitis. In the first 30 days p. p., the test group of cows had a significantly higher <b>milk</b> <b>performance</b> compared to the control, although the accumulated <b>milk</b> <b>performance</b> of 150 days did not differ significantly. The observation of the higher milk yield in the beginning lactation has to be questioned because of the concept of the experiment. Overall, Milk composition did not differ except for significantly lower protein content in the test group at the <b>milk</b> <b>performance</b> tests (MLP) between 61 and 150 days post partum. The development of body condition (BFT) and blood parameters after calving support the assumption of an intense and long lasting negative energy balance (NEB). In the control-group, an average decrease of body condition could be observed up {{to the end of the}} trial, whereas animals of the test-group gained some BFT between the measurements on days 98 and 140 post partum. During this time slice a significantly higher BFT value could be found in the test-group compared to the control group. Blood analysis did not show big differences between the groups, although a slight tendency for a better metabolic status of the test-group could be observed. The differences in the reproduction parameters between the groups were not significant. Concerning the incidences of parturient paresis and mastitis there were no differences between the groups; the incidence of dislocation of the abomasum was significantly lower in the test-group. Independent of enzyme supplementation some additional and interesting observations between BFT-development, <b>milk</b> <b>performance,</b> NEFA-concentration and days open could be made: animals, showing a high mobilization of body fat had a higher <b>milk</b> <b>performance</b> in the first 98 days of lactation compared to cows mobilizing significantly less. The latter animals therefore had significantly lower NEFA-concentrations and significantly less days open. Furthermore, in the low mobilization group a sub-group of cows could be found with a high <b>milk</b> <b>performance,</b> with average milk production exceeding that of the high-mobilization group.

The following cow milking parame-ters were analysed: milkings per cow per day, milking yield, milking speed and milking duration. An increase in milk yield in AMS barns {{has been found to}} be possible, but it is affected by a number of factors related to cow <b>milking</b> <b>performance.</b> <b>Milk</b> yield was observed to gradually grow with time after the installation of the robots. Older cows in their third and fourth lactations achieved higher milking parameter values as compared to cows in their first and second lactations. The average milk yield for the whole period was on a similar level, but, due to the fact that the duration of lactation in herd B was more than 100 days longer, that herd achieved a higher milk yield. The use of AMSs in barns enables farmers to monitor cow performance traits and study the relationships between them; farmers should try to select for traits ensuring high performance and directly related to milk yield. This study found a positive relationship between milking duration and milk yield. On the other hand, a highly negative relationship was found between milking duration and milking speed, which means that these parameters should be closely monitored.

In addition to the milk composition measures (e. g., fat, protein, lactose) traditionally recorded during <b>milk</b> <b>performance</b> test via infrared spectroscopy, novel techniques, such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, allow for a further analysis of milk into its metabolic components. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry is suitable for measuring several hundred metabolites with high throughput, and thus it is applicable to study sources of genetic and nongenetic variation of milk metabolites in dairy cows. Heritability and mode of inheritance of metabolite measurements were studied in a linear mixed model approach including expected (pedigree) and realized (genomic) relationship between animals. The genetic variability of 190 milk metabolite intensities was analyzed from 1, 295 cows held on 18 farms in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany. Besides extensive pedigree information, genotypic data comprising 37, 180 single nucleotide polymorphism markers were available.

Twenty-four fresh lactating Shami goats were randomly assigned into three dietary treatment groups (eight each) in a completely randomized design. Diets were a control with no supplements or supplemented with either 2. 5, or 5. 0 g/head/d rumenprotected methionine. The experiment started exactly after kidding and lasted for 60 days thereafter. Production variables studied were milk production, milk composition, body weights, feed intake, kids weaning weight, and milk fatty acids. Daily milk production and energy corrected milk were not affected by protected me thionine supplementation. Milk Percentages of fat, protein, total solids, and casein were also not affected by protected methionine supplementation. Likewise, fat and protein yields were not different among dietary treatments of protected methionine. No differences in milk fatty acids composition were observed by supplementing rumen protected methionine in the experiment. Feed intake, feed to milk ratio, and final body weight of dams were not changed among treatments. No differences were observed in weaning weights, average daily gain, and milk to gain ratio of kids born to dams in the experiment regardless to sex of kids. In conclusion, results indicated that supplementing rumen protected methionine to dairy goats diet did not improve their <b>milking</b> <b>performance,</b> the composition of their <b>milk,</b> or growth <b>performance</b> of their kids...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this present}} study is to {{describe}} changes occurring during the milking of cows in various periods following the introduction of an AMS (automatic milking system). The following cow milking parameters were analysed: milkings per cow per day, milking yield, milking speed and milking duration. An increase in milk yield in AMS barns {{has been found to}} be possible, but it is affected by a number of factors related to cow <b>milking</b> <b>performance.</b> <b>Milk</b> yield was observed to gradually grow with time after the installation of the robots. Older cows in their third and fourth lactations achieved higher milking parameter values as compared to cows in their first and second lactations. The average milk yield for the whole period was on a similar level, but, due to the fact that the duration of lactation in herd B was more than 100 days longer, that herd achieved a higher milk yield. The use of AMSs in barns enables farmers to monitor cow performance traits and study the relationships between them; farmers should try to select for traits ensuring high performance and directly related to milk yield. This study found a positive relationship between milking duration and milk yield. On the other hand, a highly negative relationship was found between milking duration and milking speed, which means that these parameters should be closely monitored. This study found that the optimal number of milkings per cow per day was in the range of 2. 6 to 2. 8 milkings a day with a 2. 6 kg min − 1 milking speed...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal for}} any dairy farm {{should be to}} deliver a high quality product that has {{consumer}} appeal. The objective of any heards milk management program should include: (1) maximise yield secreted by the mamary gland, (b) milk cows out in a short peroid of time, (c) prevent damage to teats, teat ends, and the udder, and (d) have no adverse effect on chemical composition of milk. It must be recognized that factors other than milking equipment, such as milking practices, can influence <b>milking</b> <b>performance</b> and quality. Cow Handling and Preparation Milk yields and milkability are maximized when calm cows are milked with a consistent routine at every milking. Proper cow handling and udder preparation will decrease unit on-time. Routines should be consistent from one milking to the next and from one milker to the next. A minimum of 12 - 15 seconds of teat contact time is required for sufficient nerve stimulation to ensure adequate oxytocin release and a good milk ejection response (Mein and Reid, 1996). Units should be attached within a window of 60 to 90 seconds from beginning of udder preparation process {{to take advantage of}} oxytocin stimulated by good teat manipulation...|$|R
