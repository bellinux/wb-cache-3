40|$|This paper {{reflects}} on the debates and the practices involved in <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> evaluating energy for development projects {{which led to the}} formulation of "A Guide to <b>Monitoring</b> <b>and</b> Evaluation for Energy Projects" by an international working group.

This paper begins with definitions of <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> evaluation and discusses the reasons for conducting such studies and the benefits to be gained. This paper then highlights selected approaches to <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> evaluation and the conditions under which each might be useful, and how and by whom lessons are to be learned. Attention is paid to key elements of <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> evaluation such as the development of indicators and the measurement of impacts. In the light of the many failed energy projects, this paper closes with some suggestions of how <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> evaluation processes and capacity may be improved. ...|$|R
