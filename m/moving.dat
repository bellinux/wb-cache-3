5|$|Along southeastern Lake Erie, {{near the}} city of Erie, Pennsylvania, a {{southern}} low-pressure area was <b>moving</b> toward the lake. This low had formed overnight, so was absent from Friday's weather map. It had been traveling northward and began <b>moving</b> northwestward after passing over Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|Ballistic {{annihilation}} {{describes a}} {{process by which}} <b>moving</b> particles and antiparticles annihilate each other when they collide. In the simplest version of this process, the system consists of a single type of particle and antiparticle, <b>moving</b> at equal speeds in opposite directions in a one-dimensional medium.|$|E
5|$|Based on this star's {{kinematic}} properties, {{it appears}} {{to belong to a}} stellar association called the Castor <b>Moving</b> Group. However, Vega may be much older than this group, so the membership remains uncertain. This group contains about 16 stars, including Alpha Librae, Alpha Cephei, Castor, Fomalhaut and Vega. All members of the group are <b>moving</b> in nearly the same direction with similar space velocities. Membership in a <b>moving</b> group implies a common origin for these stars in an open cluster that has since become gravitationally unbound. The estimated age of this <b>moving</b> group is , and they have an average space velocity of 16.5km/s.|$|E
5|$|Damage {{may occur}} {{directly}} under the site of impact, or it may occur on the side opposite the impact (coup and contrecoup injury, respectively). When a <b>moving</b> object impacts the stationary head, coup injuries are typical, while contrecoup injuries are usually produced when the <b>moving</b> head strikes a stationary object.|$|E
5|$|Goater's first {{professional}} club was Manchester United, {{but he did}} not reach the first team, making his League debut in 1989 after <b>moving</b> to Rotherham United. He played for Rotherham for seven years before <b>moving</b> to Bristol City in 1996. Two years later he moved to Manchester City for a fee of £400,000.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, Vesto Slipher made spectrographic {{studies of}} the {{brightest}} spiral nebulae to determine their composition. Slipher discovered that the spiral nebulae have high Doppler shifts, indicating that they are <b>moving</b> at a rate exceeding the velocity of the stars he had measured. He found {{that the majority of}} these nebulae are <b>moving</b> away from us.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Roksan {{introduced}} the Artaxerxes phono stage – a <b>moving</b> coil phono pre-amplifier designed to sit inside the turntable. Roksan also marketed a three-legged table {{dedicated to the}} deck. In 1987 Roksan launched the Shiraz <b>moving</b> coil phono cartridge. In 1989, Roksan launched the budget Radius record player, Tabriz arm and Corus <b>moving</b> magnet cartridge.|$|E
5|$|In September 2001, Studio Ghibli {{announced}} {{the production of}} two films. The first would become The Cat Returns and the second was an adaptation of Diana Wynne Jones' novel, Howl's <b>Moving</b> Castle. A rumor persists that Miyazaki had an idea to do Howl's <b>Moving</b> Castle {{during a visit to}} Strasbourg Christmas market. Toshio Suzuki, who produced Howl's <b>Moving</b> Castle, stated that Miyazaki was inspired to make the film when he read Jones' novel, and was struck by the image of a castle <b>moving</b> around the countryside. The novel does not explain how the castle moved, and Miyazaki was interested in figuring out how the castle might move, which led to the image of a castle on chicken legs. The complex <b>moving</b> castle changes and rearranges itself several times throughout the movie in response to Howl's eccentricity and the various situations. The basic structure of the castle consists of more than 80 elements including turrets, a wagging tongue, cogwheels and chicken legs, that were rendered as digital objects.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to her column, Michelena wrote occasional articles intended for a wider readership. She wrote in October 1916 {{about the history of}} the <b>moving</b> picture industry in a multiple-article series, beginning her account with a retelling of Eadweard Muybridge's action photograph of Governor Leland Stanford's racehorse named Occident. She defined this high-speed image as essential to the development of <b>moving</b> pictures.|$|E
5|$|In both The <b>Moving</b> Picture World and The <b>Moving</b> Picture News the {{character}} of Will was named Bill, {{but it is not}} clear if this was intentional, a renaming or error.|$|E
5|$|Lissitzky {{argued that}} as long as humans cannot fly, <b>moving</b> {{horizontally}} is natural and <b>moving</b> vertically is not. Thus, where there is not sufficient land for construction, a new plane created in the air at medium altitude should be preferred to an American-style tower. These buildings, according to Lissitzky, also provided superior insulation and ventilation for their inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|Many {{animals are}} highly {{sensitive}} to motion; for example, frogs readily detect small <b>moving</b> dark spots but ignore stationary ones. Therefore, motion signals {{can be used}} to defeat camouflage. <b>Moving</b> objects with disruptive camouflage patterns remain harder to identify than uncamouflaged objects, especially if other similar objects are nearby, even though they are detected, so motion does not completely 'break' camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Moveable sails: By {{the time}} of the Zhou Dynasty ship {{technologies}} such as stern mounted rudders were developed, and by the Han Dynasty, a well kept naval fleet {{was an integral part of}} the military. The Chinese used the complex <b>moving</b> technology behind the kite allowed then to develop the worlds first <b>moving</b> sails (in comparison with the mounted sails used in the West) around 200 AD. These <b>moving</b> sails allowed ships to sail into the wind for the first time in human history. Civilizations around the world soon emulated the Chinese technology and eventually <b>moving</b> sails became the standard on ships.|$|E
5|$|On September17, a new {{hurricane}} {{was identified}} {{just off the}} southern coast of Mexico with winds of 85mph (140km/h). <b>Moving</b> northwestward, the storm eventually made landfall near Acapulco, Mexico at this intensity. Shortly after <b>moving</b> over land, the storm lost its identity.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} {{magnetic}} fields on liquid crystal molecules are analogous to electric fields. Because magnetic fields are generated by <b>moving</b> electric charges, permanent magnetic dipoles {{are produced by}} electrons <b>moving</b> about atoms. When a magnetic field is applied, the molecules will tend to align with or against the field.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot at the 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios, with {{principal}} photography starting on 29 September 1986, before <b>moving</b> to Vienna on 5 October, where the crew filmed for two weeks. Meanwhile, the second unit had started work on the pre-credits sequence on Gibraltar on 17 September before <b>moving</b> to Morocco. Filming finished on 13 February 1987.|$|E
5|$|The song's lyrics {{were written}} by Cyrus and Casey Beathard.

5|$|Authorities of Belize City {{considered}} {{abandoning the}} community and <b>moving</b> it to higher ground. Additionally, there was a proposal to relocate the capital further south or inland to the pine ridge, with either resulting in a higher elevation of the capital. However, the process of <b>moving</b> the capital did not begin until 1961, after Belize City was devastated by Hurricane Hattie. Belmopan became {{the capital city of}} British Honduras in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Bowers {{does not}} cite any trade {{publication}} reviews for this film, making {{it unlikely that}} the film was given attention in The New York Dramatic Mirror, The <b>Moving</b> Picture World or The <b>Moving</b> Picture News publications. The film was apparently a success at the Province Theater when it was shown in Vancouver. It is possible that non-advertisement reviews of the film may exist in other publications.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Philippe Delorme, of the Institute of Planetology and Astrophysics of Grenoble in France {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} CFBDSIR 2149-0403; an independently <b>moving</b> 4-7 Jupiter-mass object that likely forms part of the AB Doradus <b>moving</b> group, less than 100 light years from Earth. Although it shares its spectrum with a spectral class T brown dwarf, Delorme speculates {{that it may be}} a planet.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} first {{millennium}} BC, Babylonian astronomers {{observed that the}} Sun's motion along the ecliptic is not uniform, though {{they did not know}} why; it is today known that {{this is due to the}} movement of Earth in an elliptic orbit around the Sun, with Earth <b>moving</b> faster when it is nearer to the Sun at perihelion and <b>moving</b> slower when it is farther away at aphelion.|$|E
