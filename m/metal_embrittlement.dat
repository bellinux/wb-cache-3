This problem is common to all arc welding processes; for example, in the older Shielded-Metal Arc Welding process (SMAW), the electrode is coated with a solid flux which evolves a protective cloud of carbon dioxide when melted by the arc. In GMAW, however, the electrode wire does not have a flux coating, and a separate shielding gas is employed to protect the weld. This eliminates slag, the hard residue from the flux that builds up after welding and must be chipped off to reveal the completed weld.|$|E

40|$|The surface {{alloying}} of 55 wt. % Al-Zn coated press hardening steel during a press hardening heat treatment was evaluated. Austenitization {{resulted in the}} formation of a surface layer containing FeAl and Fe 2 Al 5. The use of an increased heating rate during the austenitization cycle resulted in a high volume fraction of Zn at FeAl grain boundaries, and the presence of Zn islands in Fe 2 Al 5 grains. These microstructural features suppressed the high temperature oxidation and evaporation of Zn. Zn was found to provide a pronounced cathodic protection, and the alloyed coating did not cause liquid <b>metal</b> induced <b>embrittlement.</b> (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

3000|$|At this point, it is {{important}} to check the formation of a molecular hydrogen bubble in order to analyze the possible crack that is beginning to weaken the <b>metal.</b> This <b>embrittlement</b> class is responsible for failures in hydrogen-related process plants, a phenomenon known as 'Hydrogen attack’. The COOP curve corresponding to the H-H interaction presents bonding and antibonding peaks below E f [...]. We can observe that at the H-H distance of 2.55  Å, the H-H interaction is almost null, and it is because the H-H distance (at the minimum energy location) is longer than any bonding distance. According to the literature, a typical H 2 chemical bond is formed at the interatomic distance of 0.74  Å. Also, the H 2 molecule is not present in the γ-Fe 50 Ni 50 cell.|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanics}} of liquid <b>metal</b> induced <b>embrittlement</b> (LMIE) {{are not well}} understood and this phenomenon is of {{a high degree of}} industrial importance. Discontinuous and continuous crack propagation in gallium-embrittled brass was studied using double cantilever beam specimens and crack propagation was found to be discontinuous when the imposed crack speed was less than 6 mm/s and was more or less continuous if greater. The threshold K for cracking was found to be non-unique in this system and was weakly dependent on testing variables such as crosshead speed. The discontinuous crack propagation and dependence on crosshead speed were attributed to the tendency of the cracks to blunten by a process of dissolution at the crack tip. A comparison of the experimental results with existing theory suggests that crack growth may not be solely controlled by supply of embrittler to the crack tip...|$|R

50|$|Liquid <b>metal</b> <b>embrittlement,</b> {{also known}} as liquid metal induced embrittlement, is a {{phenomenon}} of practical importance, where certain ductile metals experience drastic loss in tensile ductility or undergo brittle fracture when exposed to specific liquid metals. Generally, a tensile stress, either externally applied or internally present, is needed to induce embrittlement. Exceptions to this rule have been observed, {{as in the case}} of aluminium in the presence of liquid gallium. This phenomenon has been studied since the beginning of the 20th century. Many of its phenomenological characteristics are known and several mechanisms have been proposed to explain it. The practical significance of liquid <b>metal</b> <b>embrittlement</b> is revealed by the observation that several steels experience ductility losses and cracking during hot-dip galvanizing or during subsequent fabrication. Cracking can occur catastrophically and very high crack growth rates have been measured.|$|E

It was shown that during FSW on aluminum alloy the latter adheres to the tool’s working surface and then iron/aluminum reaction diffusion is initiated under the conditions of high mechanical stress and temperature.

50|$|Hydrogen {{is present}} {{practically}} everywhere, several kilometres {{above the earth}} and inside the earth. Engineering materials are exposed to hydrogen and they may interact with it resulting in various kinds of structural damage. Damaging effects of hydrogen in metallic materials have been known since 1875 when W. H. Johnson reported “some remarkable changes produced in iron {{by the action of}} hydrogen and acids”. During the intervening years many similar effects have been observed in different structural materials, such as steel, aluminium, titanium, and zirconium. Because of the technological importance of hydrogen damage, many people explored the nature, causes and control measures of hydrogen related degradation of <b>metals.</b> Hardening, <b>embrittlement</b> and internal damage are the main hydrogen damage processes in metals. Hydrogen may be picked up by metals during melting, casting, shaping and fabrication. They are also exposed to hydrogen during their service life. Materials susceptible to hydrogen damage have ample opportunities to be degraded during all these stages.|$|R
40|$|Solid <b>metal</b> induced <b>embrittlement</b> (SMIE) {{occurs when}} a metal {{experiences}} tensile stress and is in contact with another metal with lower melting temperature. SMIE {{is believed to be}} a combined action of surface self-diffusion of the embrittling species to the crack tip and adsorption of the embrittling species at the crack tip, which weakens the crack tip region. In the present study, both SMIE of the near alpha alloy Ti- 8 Al- 1 Mo- 1 V in contact with copper and its influence by crystallographic orientation have been studied. U-bend specimens coated with copper were heat treated at 480 °C for 8 hours. One of the cracks was examined in detail using electron backscatter diffraction technique. A preferable crack path was found along high angle grain boundaries with grains oriented close to [0001] in the crack direction; this indicates that there is a connection between the SMIE crack characteristics and the crystallographic orientation...|$|R

5000|$|Liquid <b>metal</b> <b>embrittlement</b> or LME is {{characterized}} by the reduction in the threshold stress intensity, true fracture stress or in the strain to fracture when tested in the presence of liquid metals as compared to that obtained in air / vacuum tests. The reduction in fracture strain is generally temperature dependent and a [...] "ductility trough" [...] is observed as the test temperature is decreased. A ductile-to-brittle transition behaviour is also exhibited by many metal couples. The shape of the elastic region of the stress-strain curve is not altered, but the plastic region may be changed during LME. Very high crack propagation rates, varying from a few centimeters per second to several meters per second are induced in solid metals by the embrittling liquid metals. An incubation period and a slow pre-critical crack propagation stage generally precede final fracture.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of {{lead on the}} fracture behavior of aluminum alloy AA 6262 is investigated. Under certain conditions, the mode of fracture changes from transgranular microvoid coalescence to an intergranular mechanism. Three different intergranular fracture mechanisms are observed: liquid <b>metal</b> <b>embrittlement,</b> dynamic embrittlement at temperatures below the melting temperature of lead, and intergranular microvoid coalescence. An attempt is made to examine the dependence of these three mechanisms on temperature, strain rate, and stress state using in situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Liquid <b>metal</b> <b>embrittlement</b> occurs when the alloy is fractured at temperatures above the melting temperature of lead and at low strain rates. At lower temperatures, the occurrence of dynamic embrittlement depends largely on strain rate, stress state, and temperature. Intergranular microvoid coalescence is not often observed.

40|$|Solid <b>Metal</b> Induced <b>Embrittlement</b> (SMIE) {{is caused}} by a {{specific}} combination of two solid metals in intimate contact. Cadmium, gold, silver and copper are known to cause SMIE in certain titanium alloys. Solid copper is used in welding electrodes and fixtures in various manufacturing processes for titanium parts within the aerospace industry. In the case of resistance welding, titanium alloys are in intimate contact with solid copper, since the electrodes resistively heat the titanium part under pressure during the welding process. No previous published work that investigates the risk of using copper electrodes for welding of titanium alloys is available in the literature, but an initial study using U-bend testing indicates that solid copper in contact with Ti- 8 Al- 1 V- 1 Mo and Ti- 6 Al- 2 Sn- 4 Zr- 2 Mo could lead to SMIE. Therefore, in the present study, resistance welded Ti- 8 Al- 1 V- 1 Mo and Ti- 6 Al- 2 Sn- 4 Zr- 2 Mo have been evaluated to investigate the influence of copper electrodes on these alloys. Furthermore, resistance welded specimens sputtered with copper and gold to promote SMIE have also been evaluated. No SMIE was found in the resistance welded specimens, which may be explained by the short interaction time that the copper electrodes are in intimate contact with the titanium alloy, and/or the magnitude of residual stresses after welding, which may be too low to initiate SMIE.

50|$|Delayed failure, the {{fracture}} of a component under stress after an elapsed time, is a characteristic feature of hydrogen embrittlement (2). Hydrogen {{entry into the}} material may be affected during melting, casting, welding, and service life. Corrosion during service in moist environments generates hydrogen, part of which may enter the <b>metal</b> and cause <b>embrittlement.</b> Presence of a tensile stress, either inherent or externally applied, is necessary for metals to be damaged. As {{in the case of}} stress corrosion cracking, hydrogen embrittlement may also lead to a decrease in the threshold stress intensity factor for crack propagation or an increase in the sub critical crack growth velocity of the material. The most visible effect of hydrogen in materials is a drastic reduction in ductility during tensile tests. It may increase, decrease or leave unaffected the yield strength of the material. Hydrogen may cause serrated yielding in certain metals such as niobium, nickel and some steels (3).|$|R
