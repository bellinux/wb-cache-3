500|$|Although The Lion King {{itself has}} {{garnered}} universal acclaim from film critics, reception towards Simba has been generally mixed. The Christian Science Monitors David Sterritt hailed Simba as [...] "a superbly realized character," [...] specifically praising {{the scene in}} which the character [...] "faces discipline by his dad after his adventure with the hyenas." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Simba [...] "has been given a marvelously expressive face" [...] {{to the point of}} which [...] "He seems more human than the Ken and Barbie types featured in Aladdin and The Little Mermaid."

[...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews enjoyed the fact that the film focuses <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of Simba himself as opposed to the romantic relationship developing between the character and Nala. However, Berardinelli criticized Matthew Broderick's vocal performance, describing it as [...] "nondescript." [...] Rob Humanick of Slant Magazine hailed the fact that [...] "it's never laid on [...] that his time as king will directly correspond with the eventual passing of his father" [...] as one of the film's [...] "most important facets." [...] However, he criticized The Lion Kings characters, describing them as well-designed but [...] "lazy and troublesome." [...] The Austin Chronicles Robert Faires felt that Simba and the other Lion King characters, though [...] "true", were simply unoriginal retreads of preceding animated characters who were [...] "swiped from other Disney cartoons." ...|$|E

[...] Speaking about the music he explained the need for additional music rather than simply using the film's full soundtrack: [...] "you can't do heavy metal for hours and hours in the theatre - everyone would be screaming. So they have to be theatrical songs too. And we've obviously got to use the iconic songs from the original show. It would be a shame not to do a Stevie Nicks song." ...|$|R

50|$|Jommelli wrote cantatas, oratorios {{and other}} sacred works, but {{by far the}} most {{important}} part of his output were his operas, particularly his opere serie of which he composed around sixty examples, several with libretti by Metastasio. In his work, he tended to concentrate <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> and drama of the opera than on flashy technical displays by the singers, as was the norm in Italian opera at that time. He wrote more ensemble numbers and choruses, and, influenced by French opera composers such as Jean-Philippe Rameau, he introduced ballets into his work. He used the orchestra (particularly the wind instruments) in a much more prominent way to illustrate the goings-on of the story, and wrote passages for the orchestra alone rather than having it purely as support for the singers. From Johann Adolph Hasse, he learnt to write recitatives accompanied by the orchestra, rather than just by a harpsichord. His reforms are sometimes regarded as equal in importance to Christoph Willibald Gluck's.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{the earlier}} MGM film series (1938-1942), the TV series {{initially}} told <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of young intern Dr. James Kildare (Richard Chamberlain) {{working at the}} fictional large metropolitan [...] "Blair General Hospital" [...] and trying to learn his profession, deal with patients' problems, and win {{the respect of the}} senior Dr. Leonard Gillespie (Raymond Massey). In the series' first episode, Gillespie tells the earnest Kildare, [...] "Our job is to keep people alive, not to tell them how to live." [...] Kildare ignores the advice, which provides <b>the</b> basis for <b>stories</b> over <b>the</b> next four seasons, many with a soap opera touch. By the third season, Dr. Kildare was promoted to resident and episodes began to focus less on him and his medical colleagues, and <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> of individual patients and their families.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} {{focuses on}} a new method {{in the development of}} animation story content which could shorten the creation process and arouse new ideas. By implementing digital storyboarding for direct story creation, a reversed model of animation process, this research examines the feasibility of this method and discusses its pros and cons in story development, story structure and implications for animation education. The results showed that storyboard driven method in creating animation content is workable and time saving. This method is helpful for novices in visualizing and revising their creative ideas. We found that a good story structure could still be created with storyboard driven method. Compared with the traditional production pipeline, the contributions of this method in story structure were <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> climax, resolution, and plot. From the evaluation results although experts confirmed feasibility of this method, they still preferred traditional story design process...|$|E

40|$|Differences in subject {{description}} of juvenile fiction was investigated on five examples of international classics in five library catalogues: Oton Župančič Public Library (Knjižnica Otona Župančiča) in Ljubljana, Slovenia, Stadtbibliothek public library in Graz, Austria, integrated catalogues of libraries in the Gorizia region in Italy (Sistema bibliotecario della Provincia di Gorizia) and the Karlovac region in Croatia (Skupni katalog knjižnica Karlovačke županije) in September 2008. As Slovenian youth rarely speaks languages of neighbouring countries, British Library catalogue was added. Results show that catalogue records are inconsistent within an individual library {{as well as}} in comparision with other libraries in the sample. Librarians do not make consistent subject descriptions. Class number, which is present in all catalogues except in the Austrian one, usually represents: the author’s country, language and/or nationality,the literary genre, and the target audience. Subject headings in the sample bring information on the subject (aboutness), author’s country, language and/or nationality, the literary genre, and target audience. Summaries tell <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> But they can also bring information on emotional experience of the reader, information on the author or history of the literary work. It would be economically beneficial if subject description could be more consistent. But uniform subject description is not possible because of diverse library collections and users. The solution might be in the use of multiple levels of subject description regarding to the type of the libraries...|$|E
40|$|Why You Can’t Believe Everything You Read (including {{what is in}} this message) : I was {{reminded}} in recent weeks {{that even the most}} experienced and prominent researchers will make serious and potentially dangerous mistakes. Two incidents come to mind. The first was a report published by the Education Sector and the American Council of Trustees and Alumni stating “that faculty teaching loads had gone down substantially, contributing to the rising cost of higher education. ” The report, titled "Selling Students Short," claimed that “from 1987 - 1988 to 2003 - 2004, the average number of courses tenured and tenure-track faculty taught per term…declined 25 percent. " The research summarized in the report, however, turned out to be incorrect. A blog post from Andrew Gillen, the research director at Education Sector, admitted that they “cannot determine whether teaching loads for the typical professor declined, stayed the same, or increased. " Read more information here. Even more serious was the mistake made in a 2010 paper by Carmen Reinhart, currently a professor at Harvard Kennedy School, and Kenneth Rogoff, an economist at Harvard University. “They argued that GDP growth slows to a snail’s pace once government-debt levels exceed 90 % of GDP. The 90 % figure quickly became ammunition in political arguments over austerity. ” In fact, the above paper shaped many political arguments and economic policies in the US and abroad. A graduate student named Thomas Herndon at the University of Massachusetts tried to replicate the results of the Reinhart-Rogoff paper only to discover it was riddled with mistakes. See <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> here. My conclusion? Always check, then double-check, published results, even those by famous and (usually) careful researchers.

Premiering on September 28, 1961, the series was a top-10 hit with audiences and ran until April 5, 1966, for a total of 191 episodes in five seasons. The first two seasons told <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of Dr. James Kildare (Chamberlain), working in a fictional large metropolitan hospital while trying to learn his profession, deal with his patients' problems and earn the respect of the senior Dr. Leonard Gillespie (Massey).
