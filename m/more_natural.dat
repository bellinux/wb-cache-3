5|$|Director Colin Campbell was {{concerned}} with the film's realism. He had sets constructed to represent the streets of Cairo, Baghdad, and Damascus, and used animals from the Selig Zoo. Scenes set in the Arabian and Sahara Deserts were filmed in the deserts of California. The Arab characters' clothing was genuine, and the actors portraying those roles were required to remain dressed in-character throughout the several days of desert filming to ensure they would appear <b>more</b> <b>natural</b> in the imported garments. Much of the film, including the desert scenes, was hand tinted. Production costs exceeded $35,000, the equivalent of over $ in present-day terms.|$|E
5|$|During the Nara period, from 710 to 794, the {{government}} established and supported workshops called zōbussho, {{the most prominent}} of which was located in the capital Nara at Tōdai-ji, which produced Buddhist statuary. Clay, lacquer and wood, in addition to bronze, were used. Stylistically, the sculptures were influenced by the high Tang style, showing fuller body modelling, <b>more</b> <b>natural</b> drapery and a greater sense of movement. Representative examples of Nara period sculpture include the Great Buddha and the Four Heavenly Kings at Tōdai-ji, or the Eight Legions at Kōfuku-ji.|$|E

He compared Näslund to the Los Angeles Kings' Swedish forward Tomas Sandström, {{although he did not}} consider him as aggressive a player, and further claimed that he was a <b>more</b> <b>natural</b> goal-scorer than Penguins forward Jaromír Jágr, who had just completed his rookie year with the club.|$|E

5|$|Robinson {{advocated}} <b>more</b> <b>natural</b> {{and less}} formal-looking plantings of hardy perennials, shrubs, and climbers, and reacted against the High Victorian patterned gardening, which used tropical materials grown in greenhouses. He railed against standard roses, statuary, sham Italian gardens, and other artifices common in gardening at the time. Modern gardening practices first introduced by Robinson include: using alpine plants in rock gardens; dense plantings of perennials and groundcovers that expose no bare soil; use of hardy perennials and native plants; and large plantings of perennials in natural-looking drifts.|$|E

5|$|Around 1925, {{having had}} little success in Batavia, Andjar moved to Padang, {{where he was}} a {{reporter}} for the daily Sinar Soematera. At the same time, he worked with the city's Padangsche Opera, writing stage plays. In contrast to the standard musical theatre of the time, bangsawan, he promoted a <b>more</b> <b>natural</b> style, using dialogue instead of song to convey the story; he referred to this as toneel, based on the Dutch word for theatre. Among the works he wrote for the Padangsche Opera were adaptations of Melati van Agam, a 1923 work by Swan Pen, and Sitti Nurbaya, a 1922 novel by Marah Roesli. These works were well received.|$|E
5|$|By 1799, the {{original}} house at Luscombe had been demolished, and work began {{on a new}} house for Hoare in 1800. The house was designed by John Nash, who was a pioneer for the Gothic Revival style. In his early drawings for the house, Repton suggested two sketches to Hoare; one of a more standard house, {{and the other with}} the <b>more</b> <b>natural</b> design which would settle into the landscape. The latter was chosen and the final design of the house was based upon Downton Castle, but with an asymmetrical plan to experience the panoramic views around the house. It was Nash's first attempt at a Gothic castle design and he would subsequently create several further houses in the same style.|$|E

5|$|Colder weather, {{bringing}} with it rain and snow on September 11 calmed the fires down substantially throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Though the fires continued to burn {{well into the}} middle of November, they never again posed an immediate risk to life or property. Many fire crews were sent home, but additional manpower continued to arrive at Yellowstone to rehabilitate areas that had been affected by the firefighting efforts. Hundreds of miles of firelines, helicopter landing zones and fire camps needed to be restored to a <b>more</b> <b>natural</b> state, and thousands of hazardous dead trees needed to be cut down to protect roads and buildings. Finally, on November 18, all fires in Yellowstone were officially declared out.|$|E
5|$|Halos {{characters}} were continually refined through development, {{as the company}} was bought by Microsoft and the platform shifted from the Macintosh to the Xbox. Other Bungie developers would often add input to the progress of characters in Halo, {{even if they were}} not working on the game itself. For example, an outside artist, Shi Kai Wang, developed the early concept sketches of what would eventually become the Master Chief. However upon developing a 3D model, the artists decided the Chief looked too slender, almost effeminate, and subsequently bulked up the character. Early Covenant Elites had a <b>more</b> <b>natural</b> jaw rather than the split mandibles they would later sport; at one point, Jason Jones was also insistent about having a tail on the Elites, but this idea was eventually dropped.|$|E
5|$|However, Shakespeare {{soon began}} to adapt the {{traditional}} styles to his own purposes. The opening soliloquy of Richard III {{has its roots in}} the self-declaration of Vice in medieval drama. At the same time, Richard's vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare's mature plays. No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with Romeo and Juliet perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles. By the time of Romeo and Juliet, Richard II, and A Midsummer Night's Dream in the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a <b>more</b> <b>natural</b> poetry. He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself.|$|E
