5|$|David Cameron (Conservative {{leader and}} Prime Minister) said:... {{he was an}} {{extraordinary}} man: a great writer, a brilliant speaker, extraordinary in Parliament, and a great life of public and political and parliamentary service. I <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> disagreed with most of what he said. But he was always engaging and interesting, and you were never bored when reading or listening to him, and the country a great campaigner, a great writer, and someone who I'm sure whose words will be followed keenly for many, many years to come.|$|E
5|$|It's {{about how}} people take drugs to connect to God or {{to a higher level}} of consciousness. I keep saying, 'Plugging into the matrix'. If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the {{illusion}} of drugs, because they give you the illusion of getting closer to God, but ultimately they kill you. They destroy you. I <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water {{to get it out of}} my system. As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of me. I was like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E

That doesn't <b>mean</b> <b>I</b> don't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When I put him in the first team, he never lets me down. I value Jerry's professionalism and for as long as I remain manager of Birmingham, {{there will always be a}} place for him here.|$|E

25|$|Tom Bombadil {{is not an}} {{important}} person—to the narrative. I suppose he has some importance as a 'comment.'

25|$|As {{a general}} example, if a null {{hypothesis}} {{is assumed to}} follow the standard normal distribution N(0,1), then the rejection of this null hypothesis can either <b>mean</b> (<b>i)</b> the mean is not zero, or (ii) the variance is not unity, or (iii) the distribution is not normal, {{depending on the type}} of test performed. However, supposing we manage to reject the zero mean hypothesis, even if we know the distribution is normal and variance is unity, the null hypothesis test does not tell us which non-zero value we should adopt as the new mean.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the {{recording}} of this album, Van Peebles had released a trio of experimental albums, Brer Soul, Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death and As Serious as a Heart-Attack, which {{were considered to be}} spoken word at the time, due to their use of sprechgesang. Modern critics have since dubbed these albums as precursors to hip hop music. Van Peebles wanted to record an album that showed that he could perform in a more traditional form, as opposed to the style he had used on his previous albums, titling it What the....You <b>Mean</b> <b>I</b> Can't Sing?! because of this.|$|E
25|$|Jane was {{appointed}} as a {{lady of the}} Queen's bedchamber on 15 July 1851. Although hard-working, loyal and devoted, she lacked the knowledge and discretion required for the role. In 1855, Mary Bulteel, later {{the wife of the}} Queen's private secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby, disapproved of Jane's conduct, and commented that “Lady E. is more utterly the reverse from what she ought to be on this occasion than anybody can possibly conceive. I <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> see she is preparing to be foolishly cringing to all the little miseries of etiquette...I quite long for somebody as the Queen's first lady with more natural dignity”. Despite her shortcomings, the Queen came to rely heavily on “Dearest Jane”, as she was referred to. The Queen required the utmost effort and devotion from her servants, and Jane followed this code of conduct with total deference to her royal mistress. However, her health suffered as a result, and it remained a constant burden throughout her waiting. In a letter from Henry Ponsonby to Sir Thomas Biddulph, another courtier, he reported that Jane “was principally taken up with her own health”. Jane was also concerned about her own health, and in 1876, she confided to Ponsonby that “she cannot go on as it is, that it is killing her”, and he advised her to write to the Queen threatening to resign if her position was not made easier. The Queen relented, but continued to impose restrictions on Jane's contact with the outside world. Jane's son, who became the 4th Marquess on {{the death of his father}} in 1857, was anxious to visit, but the Queen would not allow him to. Instead, he requested an interview with Ponsonby about his mother's arduous duties; Ponsonby accepted, but Jane said “oh no, perhaps the Queen would not like it”. Ponsonby referred to this fear of the Queen as absurd, knowing that the Queen would not be angry with him for paying a visit to Jane's son.|$|E

500|$|On February 27, 2011, he and Anne Hathaway {{hosted the}} 83rd Academy Awards. The two were {{selected}} to help the awards show achieve its goal of attracting a younger audience. Franco had previously said that he accepted the job for the experience {{and because it was}} a once in a lifetime opportunity. Numerous media viewers criticized Franco for his discontent and lack of energy on stage and the show was widely panned, with some reviewers dubbing it the worst telecast in its history. The actor later spoke about his hosting in an interview on the Late Show with David Letterman. He explained that when accepting the job he never had high hopes, adding [...] "It was never on my list of things to do.
