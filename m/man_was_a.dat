5|$|Sharon Kay Penman (born August 13, 1945) is an American {{historical}} novelist, {{published in}} the UK as Sharon Penman. She {{is best known for}} the Welsh Princes trilogy and the Plantagenet series. In addition, she has written four medieval mysteries, the first of which, The Queen's <b>Man,</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> finalist in 1996 for the Best First Mystery Edgar Award. Her novels and mysteries are set in England, France, and Wales, and are about English and Welsh royalty during the Middle Ages. The Sunne in Splendour, her first book, is a stand-alone novel about King Richard III of England and the Wars of the Roses. When the manuscript was stolen she started again and rewrote the book.|$|E
5|$|The {{theological}} {{concerns were}} twofold: first, putting {{man at the}} same level as monkeys or apes would lower the spiritually higher position that man was assumed to have in the great chain of being, and second, because the Bible says man was created in the image of God (theomorphism), if monkeys/apes and humans were not distinctly and separately designed, that would mean monkeys and apes were created in the image of God as well. This was something many could not accept. The conflict between world views that was caused by asserting <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> type of animal would simmer for a century until the much greater, and still ongoing, creation–evolution controversy began in earnest with the publication of On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin in 1859.|$|E
60|$|<b>Man</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> flagon, and {{his soul}} the wine, <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> lamp, wherein the Soul doth shine, <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> shaken reed, wherein that wind, The Soul, doth ever rustle and repine.|$|R
5000|$|The paradox {{was once}} {{discussed}} by St. Jerome in a sermon: [...] "'I {{said in my}} alarm, Every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> liar!' Is David telling the truth or is he lying? If {{it is true that}} every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> liar, and David's statement, [...] "Every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> liar" [...] <b>is</b> true, then David also is lying; he, too, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> But if he, too, is lying, his statement: [...] "Every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> liar," [...] consequently is not true. Whatever way you turn the proposition, the conclusion <b>is</b> <b>a</b> contradiction. Since David himself <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> it follows that he also is lying; but if he is lying because every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> liar, his lying <b>is</b> of <b>a</b> different sort." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "In <b>a</b> Promethean sense, <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> God. But on an {{even more}} {{profound}} level, <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> beast. This primary contradiction has plagued mankind for millennia. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> God. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> beast. These two aspects of his personality have been waging war with one another for countless centuries; a war whose casualties are seen everywhere and recognized nowhere. But there exists, however, a long forgotten place in the soul where God and beast intersect. To go to that place is to witness {{the death of one}} world and the birth of another...join me." ...|$|R
5|$|Until the Taung childthe 2.8 million-year-old {{remains of}} an Australopithecus africanuswere {{discovered}} in South Africa in 1924, Dubois's and Koenigswald's discoveries were the oldest hominid remains ever found. Some scientists {{of the day}} suggested that Dubois's Java <b>Man</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> potential intermediate form between modern humans and the common ancestor we share with the other great apes. This supposition has been confirmed, but the current consensus of anthropologists is that the direct ancestors of modern humans were African populations of Homo erectus (possibly Homo ergaster), rather than the Asian populations {{of the same species}} exemplified by Java Man and Peking Man.|$|E
5|$|While Hungarian scholar György Györffy {{supports}} {{the identification of}} Ivan the Russian as the Iwan dicto Oroz of Hungarian chronicles, historian István Vásáry points {{to the lack of}} clear evidence and the large time span between the two. Before that identification was proposed, it was considered that Ivan had arrived in Bulgaria after fleeing the Mongol conquest of Rus', much like another Russian in Bulgarian service, Jacob Svetoslav. Either way, in 1323 Ivan's right-hand <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Hungarian named Inas.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of death, Lindow <b>Man</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> healthy male in his mid-20s, {{and he may have}} been someone of high status, as his body shows little {{evidence}} of heavy or rough work. There has been debate over the reason for Lindow Man's death, for the nature of his demise was violent, perhaps ritualistic; after a last meal of charred bread, Lindow Man was strangled, hit on the head, and his throat cut. Dating the body has proven problematic, but it is thought that Lindow Man was deposited into Lindow Moss, face down, some time between 2 BC and 119AD, in either the Iron Age or Romano-British period. The body has been preserved by freeze-drying and is on permanent display at the British Museum, although it occasionally travels to other venues such as the Manchester Museum.|$|E
5000|$|Talking <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> 1986 fantasy {{novel by}} American author Terry Bisson. The book {{tells the story}} of a Kentucky {{mechanic}} called [...] "Talking Man". Talking <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> wizard who creates his own world.|$|R

6000|$|... 2. But this {{origin of}} all words that convey a spiritual import,--so {{conspicuous}} a fact {{in the history}} of language,--is our least debt to nature. It is not words only that are emblematic; it is things which are emblematic. Every natural fact <b>is</b> <b>a</b> symbol of some spiritual fact. Every appearance in nature corresponds to some state of the mind, and that state of the mind can only be described by presenting that natural appearance as its picture. An enraged <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> lion, <b>a</b> cunning <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> fox, <b>a</b> firm <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> rock, <b>a</b> learned <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> torch. <b>A</b> lamb <b>is</b> innocence; <b>a</b> snake <b>is</b> subtle spite; flowers express to us the delicate affections. Light and darkness are our familiar expression for knowledge and ignorance; and heat for love. Visible distance behind and before us, is respectively our image of memory and hope.|$|R
5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. The fantasy of a flying house was {{developed}} {{on the idea}} of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> good idea for a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and the way that they affect their view of the world was a rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl {{in the way that they}} relate to their grandparents.|$|E
5|$|Later on {{the evening}} of 7 August, she asked Bamber whether he had done it. He said no, but that a friend of his had, whom he named; the <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> plumber the family had used in the past. Bamber {{allegedly}} said he had told this friend how he could enter and leave the farmhouse undetected, and that one of his instructions had been for the friend to telephone him from the farm on one of the phones in the house that had a memory redial facility, so that if the police checked it, it would give him an alibi. Everything had gone as planned, he said, except that Nevill had put up a fight, and the friend had become angry and shot him seven times. The friend had allegedly told Sheila to lie down and shoot herself last, Bamber said. The friend then placed the Bible on her chest so she appeared to have killed herself in a religious frenzy. The children were shot in their sleep, he said. Mugford said Bamber claimed to have paid the friend £2,000.|$|E

40|$|AbstractLiterary {{discourse}} {{is motivated by}} figurative schemes of thought structuring our understanding of experience. This paper puts an insight into the way the conceptual metaphor “A <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> Animal/Beast” generates literary discourse. Proliferation of the conceptual metaphor “A <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> Animal/Beast” in Bulgakov's stories reveals lexical repetition of key metaphorical words and semantically complex links of conceptual metaphors and key textual metaphors. The role of translations of Bulgakov's masterpieces is particularly crucial for reconstruction and verification of “A <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> Animal/Beast” conceptual metaphor realization in the literary discourse...|$|R
