40|$|Macro voids are {{undesirable}} large pores in membranes {{used for}} purification. They form when <b>membranes</b> are <b>cast</b> as thin films on a smooth surface by evaporating solvent (acetone) from a polymer solution. There are two un-tested hypotheses explaining {{the growth of}} macro voids. One states that diffusion of the non-solvent (water) is solely responsible, while the other states that solutocapillary convection is {{the primary cause of}} macro void growth. Solutocapillary convection is flow-caused by a concentration induced surface-tension gradient. Macrovoid growth in the former hypothesis is gravity independent, while in the latter it is opposed by gravity. To distinguish between these two hypotheses, experiments were designed to <b>cast</b> <b>membranes</b> in zero-gravity.

40|$|The common {{technique}} for {{the preparation of}} polymeric membranes with asymmetric structure is the phase inversion process. In this process, a polymer is dissolved in an appropriate solvent before casted on a suitable support. The casted film is then immersed in a non-solvent bath and the coagulation process taking place to form a membrane. The asymmetric membrane structure and its properties are influence by many experimental parameters such as the thickness of membrane, the polymer solution composition, coagulation bath composition, choice of solvent and non-solvent, the <b>membrane</b> <b>casting</b> speed and the knife shape which inducing casting shear rate can be determined in the <b>membrane</b> <b>casting</b> procedure.

Surface modified multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were used as an efficient element to enhance the gripping of this actuator. In particular, a thin layer of PSA with a thickness of 12 nm is uniformly grafted on the surfaces of MWNTs. The watersoluble PSA-g-MWNTs can be homogeneously dispersed in the PSA/PVA membrane with a loading ratio of up to 20 wt %. Such a uniform dispersion generated many unique properties in this composite membrane, including enhanced toughness, relatively constant ionic-exchange capacity, and prominent structure integrity after water uptake. We argue that all these novel material properties are due to a removal of the interface mismatch between the MWNTs and the polymer membrane. As a result, a much-enhanced gripping is resulted from electrical stimuli, an indication of a promoted electromechanical coupling. When the loading of PSA- g-MWNTs reaches more than 10 wt %, the small oscillation in the mechanical output of the actuator vanishes. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{modification}} of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes was successfully performed by doping anhydrous and hydrated aluminum oxide particles (γ-alumina, boehmite and gibbsite) through in situ particle embedment and subsequent crystal growth under a hydrothermal environment. The approach of particle embedment involves the dispersion of anhydrous or hydrated aluminum oxide {{particles in the}} water phase during PVDF membrane precipitation, {{and the result was}} found to strongly depend on the change of free energy in particle-membrane interaction. The embedment of γ-alumina nanoparticles is thermodynamically favorable, but the embedment of boehmite or gibbsite particles is less favorable, especially when using hydrophilic polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) additive within the <b>membrane</b> <b>cast</b> solution. The approach of 105 °C hydrothermal treatment initiates the growth of gibbsite on embedded γ-alumina nanoparticles, and the treatment duration determines the coverage of gibbsite particles on PVDF membrane. The overall hydrophilicity of membranes increases with the embedment of γ-alumina and the growth of gibbsite. An increase of membrane resistance was not observed with γ-alumina embedment, but the excessive growth of gibbsite particles may reduce membrane permeability. The Escherichia coli attachment result shows that the surface doping of aluminum oxide particles can greatly reduce E. coli adhesion to the membrane surface, suggesting the positive effect on the reduction of bio-fouling. The success of this PVDF membrane modification method has also provided a promising strategy to manipulate the surface property of other polymer membranes by inorganic materials. © 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|Owing to {{remarkable}} features, such as self-cleaning, anti-biofouling {{and drag}} reduction, interest on rendering surfaces water-repellent has significantly grown within this decade. Attempts on making surfaces superhydrophobic, where high water contact angle (above 150 degrees) accompanied with only few degrees of roll-off angle, have been extensively demonstrated through the mimicking {{of the surface}} chemistry and morphology of lotus leaves. This appealing phenomenon also exists on another structure from nature: surfaces comprising soft hairs. Although the role of this piliferous integument has long been recognized for providing life, arthropods in particular, water-repellency, the synthetic superhydrophobic surfaces based on this structure are still very limited. In this study, {{the goal was to}} develop a novel liquid-repellent surface by mimicking the hairy exterior of species. The artificial hairy surfaces were prepared by means of pressurized membrane casting, in which thermoplastic sheets were forced to flow into porous membranes at elevated temperature. The ?-shaped pillars on the <b>membrane</b> <b>cast</b> polypropylene substrate are particularly similar to the conformation of natural hairs. The principle of this fabrication technique is relatively accessible and is expected to be compatible with large-area fabrication of superhydrophobic interfaces. The artificial hairy surface features perfectly hydrophobic response where no contact angle hysteresis was observed from video assessment. Thus the artificial hairy surface of the current work appears to be the first report to have such extreme hydrophobicity with only structural modification from the original substrate. This ultralow adhesion to water droplet is believed to be attributed to the hydrophobic methyl groups and the mechanical response of the artificial hairs. Liquid repellency of the hairy surfaces was further enhanced by coating with fluorocarbon (CF) layers via deep reactive ion etching (DRIE). The contact angle of water-methanol mixture was raised from 60 degrees to around 140 degrees. The surface energy of coated samples, however, was still not low enough to repel non-polar liquids.

On the contrary, in the high shear region, the increase in permeance or decrease in selectivity was believed to be attributed by porous skins and fracture. Surprisingly, it was found that in high shear region the deterioration of molecular orientation had been detected and appeared to be contradicted from the previous studies. Based on the experimental results, there may have existed an optimum shear rate to yield optimal membrane morphology for gas separation. The selectivity of 581 sâˆ’ 1 sheared membrane had been further improved to 5. 92 at 100 Â°C curing temperature and 72 h curing time...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{demonstrates}} {{the effect of}} casting conditions (relative humidity and temperature) on morphology of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF-HFP) membranes prepared from solution of the co-polymer in tetrahydrofuran (solvent) and water (non-solvent and pore former). Membranes with thicknesses of 4 - 6 mu m have been obtained by doctor blade casting under different conditions. High-temperature <b>cast</b> <b>membranes</b> yield less porous <b>membranes.</b> Low-temperature <b>casting</b> results in a maximum of 52 % (surface) porosity of membranes. High relative humidity (80 %) during casting results in bigger pore size in membrane than low relative humidity. Membranes containing liquid electrolyte {{have been subjected to}} testing in dye-sensitized solar cells as quasi-solid electrolytes. A maximum photo-conversion efficiency of 2. 5 % for 1 cm(2) active area has been achieved in membrane-based cells as compared to 2. 8 % for cells having liquid electrolyte. High-temperature <b>cast</b> <b>membranes</b> result in poor performance due to hindrance in the charge transport...|$|R

Considerable research is focusing on the surface modification of titanium implants for the treatment of orthopaedic tissue injuries to increase the success of orthopaedic fixations. Chitosan is one of the natural materials under investigation based on several favourable properties. Numerous techniques have been described for the preparation of chitosan <b>membranes,</b> including solution <b>casting</b> methods for the investigation of bioactivity before applying coatings onto potential titanium implants. Solution casting enables the easy in-house evaluation of chitosan membranes and allows for the selection of promising chitosan materials. We present a method for the standardized and easily applied preparation of chitosan <b>membranes</b> by solution <b>casting.</b> This protocol is suitable for chitosan materials spanning a wide degree of deacetylation, being derived from different chitin sources and chitosan derivatives with novel properties. We detail the preparation and quality control methods in order to prepare membranes with favourable bioactivity, sustaining cell attachment and proliferation for extended culture periods. The possibilities associated with the use of chitosan in tissue engineering applications are far from being exhausted and numerous challenges remain prior to successful translation into the clinics. Based on our experience, we have developed simple in-house methods for quality control of homogeneous <b>membrane</b> <b>casting</b> and early prediction of successful experimental outcome...|$|R
40|$|Cellulose acetate (CA) -silver (Ag) {{nanocomposite}} asymmetric membranes {{were prepared}} via the wet-phase inversion method by dispersing polyvinylpirrolydone-protected Ag nanoparticles in the <b>membrane</b> <b>casting</b> solutions of different compositions. Silver nanoparticles were synthesized ex situ {{and added to}} the casting solution as a concentrated aqueous colloidal dispersion. The effects of the dispersion addition on the structure and on the selective permeation properties of the membranes were studied by comparing the nanocomposites with the silver-free materials. The casting solution composition {{played an important role}} in the adequate dispersion of the silver nanoparticles in the membrane. Incorporation of nanoscale silver and the final silver content resulted in structural changes leading to an increase in the hydraulic permeability and molecular weight cut-off of the nanocomposite membranes.
