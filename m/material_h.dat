40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} the strength mis-match effect on cleavage fracture of notched materials {{based on the}} local approach. The aim {{of the study is}} to verify the independence of the critical Weibull stress at fracture on the strength mis-match condition. Diffusion bonded joints were made with two materials S and H different in strength level. Two types of 3 -point bend specimen were extracted. One had a notch in the lower strength material S near the bonded interface, and another in the higher strength <b>material</b> <b>H.</b> Homogeneous specimens were also made for each material. The critical CTOD value at cleavage fracture for the overmatched specimen with a notch in the material S was smaller than that of the homogeneous specimen of the material S. By contrast, the undermatched specimen with a notch in the <b>material</b> <b>H</b> showed apparently larger critical CTOD value than the homogeneous specimen of the <b>material</b> <b>H.</b> The strength mis-match effect on the CTOD results was explained in terms of the constraint effect on the near-tip stress field. Namely, the near-tip stress is elevated by strength overmatching and relaxed by strength undermatching. The Weibull stresses for the homogeneous and mis-matched specimens were evaluated {{in the light of the}} near-tip stress fields. The critical Weibull stress at fracture did not depend on the strength mis-match condition near the notch. By using the critical Weibull stress obtained for the homogeneous specimen, the strength mis-match effect on the CTOD results can be predicted. Close agreement was observed between the critical CTOD value predicted and that obtained by the experiment. 1...|$|E
