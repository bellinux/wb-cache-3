Samples of RW were repeatedly collected from storage tanks and pits of 14 <b>Mushroom</b> <b>composting</b> sites in England and Ireland. Relationships between the effects of submerged aeration of the RW, the chemical and microbial characteristics of the RW, and the odors emitted were investigated. Recycled water samples were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity (EC), redox potential, and dissolved oxygen concentration after 7 to 14 d cold storage. Freeze-dried material from the RW samples was chemically profiled by pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), {{and the content of}} odor precursor compounds was determined by the ninhydrin colorimetric method. The headspace air of containerized RW samples was analyzed by thermal desorption GC-MS and with gas detection tubes and assessed for odor intensity (OI) and concentration by panelists and serial dilution olfactometry. The predominant odorants in the headspace and freeze-dried residues of RW samples were volatile sulfur-containing compounds and carboxylic acids. The headspace OI, EC, dry matter content, and redox potential of RW were interrelated. The headspace OI and combined concentration of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) + dimetyl sulfide of RW were correlated (R- 2 = 0. 635; P < 0. 001). Prediction of the OI of RW by measuring RW EC and the concentration of headspace sulfides using gas detector tubes enables rapid and low-cost monitoring of RW from <b>mushroom</b> <b>composting</b> sites.

There were also control plots which were not treated with any of the organic fertilizers. During the first 50 days crop period which followed the insecticide treatment, the chlorfenvinphos soil concentrations were always greater in the organic fertilizer-treated plots, than in the untreated ones (controls). The intensity of the organic fertilizers effect as to the increase of chlorfenvinphos soil persistence was in the following increasing order: city refuse compost < cow manure < <b>mushroom</b> cultivation <b>compost.</b> The organic fertilizer effects were greater when they had been soil-incorporated 3. 5 months-instead of 1 month-before the chlorfenvinphos soil treatment. The increase of the insecticide soil concentrations-due to the organic fertilizers treatments-should increase the plant protection efficiency during the period of the first 50 days, during which time the young plants are the most sensitive to insects. During the following period of the 2 or 3 last crop weeks, the effects of the organic fertilizers onto the rate of chlorfenvinphos soil metabolism were levelled off; at harvest, the very low soil-resting residues were similar in the organic fertilizers treated and untreated plots.

Various strains of T. lanuginosus produced a single xylanase with molecular masses in range of 22. 0 to 29. 0 kDa. Pure β-xylanase obtained from various strains of this fungus exhibited highly stability at high temperature and wide pH range. The optimal temperature and optimal pH of pure β-xylanase from various strains of T. lanuginosus have been reported in range of 60 - 75 °C and pH 6. 0 - 7. 0, respectively. The great thermal stability was resulting from the present of hydrophilic amino acid on beta sheet of the surface of xylanase structure. Moreover, the relatedness between high and low xylanase producing strains can be distinguish by random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Based on nucleotide sequences and T. lanuginosus xylanase gene has been classified {{to be a member of}} family 11 (formerly known as cellulase family G) glycosyl hydrolases.

Dactylium dendroides isolate SP was the most effective in reducing mycelial growth of A. mellea isolate 1 (Am 1), followed by Trichoderma harzianum isolate Th 2 and T. viride isolate Tv 4. Th 2, Th 22, Tv 3 and SP grew extensively over Am 1 colonies, disintegrating the rhizomorphs. Isolate Tham 1 of T hamatum was the most effective in reducing mycelial growth of A. mellea isolate 2 (Am 2), followed by Tv 3. Th 12, Th 22, Tv 1, Tv 3 and SP inhibited the initiation and growth of rhizomorphs of Am 2. Regeneration tests showed that both Am 1 and Am 2 attacked by Trichoderma isolates and SP were no longer viable. Th 23 and SP were almost as effective in vivo as in vitro. But isolate Co of Chaetomium olivaceum, which was ineffective in vitro, was found effective in vivo. Conversely, Th 2, which exhibited good antagonistic activity in vitro, performed poorly in vivo. These results show that the in vitro and in vivo efficacies of potential antagonists may not necessarily be closely correlated.

40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2015. Includes bibliographical references. Several Pleurotus spp. {{have been}} {{documented}} to release allelopathic compounds against nematodes in laboratory trials. Introduction of this fungus to a crop production field for nematode management are challenged by various environmental factors. Two approaches were proposed to introduce spent oyster <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost</b> waste to a basil (Ocimum basilicum) agroecosystem: 1) amending transplant media mix with spent <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost</b> substrate, and or 2) delivering the mycotoxin through drenching plant roots with <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost</b> water extract (MCWE). Specific objectives of this thesis include 1) determining amendment rates of Pleurotus sp. compost into potting media to suppress root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne incognita), 2) determine concentrations of <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost</b> water extract for nematode suppression, and 3) evaluate a spent oyster <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost</b> based technology for pre- and post-plant nematode management in field trials. A greenhouse pot trial demonstrated that amending spent Pleurotus ostreatus compost with coffee grounds as the substrate, did not suppress population densities of Meloidogyne incognita on basil planted in a sand: soil mix. Four laboratory trials were conducted using spent oyster <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost</b> amended into media with high organic matters in Cone-tainers: yard waste compost was used in Conetainer I, II, and III. And peat: moss: perlite was used in Cone-tainer IV. Numbers of M. incognita were suppressed at <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost</b> amendment rate ≥ 1 % in a yard waste compost media. When amended into peat moss potting mix, <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost</b> amendment also suppressed M. incognita penetration at 1 and 33 %. When preparing <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost</b> into MCWE, a minimum of 1 % concentration is needed to suppress mobility of M. incognita if incubated for ≥ 2 days. However, the nematode suppressive effect of MCWE was nematostatic instead of nematicidal. When M. incognita J 2 s were incubated for 7 days in MCWE Trial II, MCWE suppressed 22 and 41 % of viability of M. incognita at as low as 10 and 25 % concentration, respectively. Application of oyster <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost</b> was then evaluated in two field trials at Poamoho (Trial I) and Magoon (Trial II), respectively. Although <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost</b> amendment did not suppress plant-parasitic nematodes in both trials, its effects on soil health varied by trial. In Trial I, <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost</b> (amendment or drenching) plots were dominated by bacterial decomposition (lower CI, P < 0. 01) initially, and resulted in a reduced soil food web structure (lower SI, P < 0. 05). Lack of enhancement of fungivorous nematodes in this trial indicated a poor mushroom mycelia establishment in this field. However, in Trial II, <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost</b> amendment enhanced fungal decomposition as indicated by higher abundance of fungivorous nematodes than no <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost</b> treatments (P < 0. 05) throughout the basil crop. The enhancement of fungivorous nematodes throughout Trial II coincided with enhancement of soil health conditions as indicated {{by an increase in}} abundance of bacterivorous (P < 0. 05) and omnivorous (P < 0. 01) nematodes compared to no mushroom treatments. When used as a seedling potting mix amendment, nematode richness in amendment plots was also increased (P < 0. 05) compared to no amendment. However, spent oyster <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost</b> did not improve basil yield due to heavy infestation of Peronospora belbahrii, but amendment improved height in Poamoho. Spent oyster <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost</b> as amendment and sometimes as drench increased bacterivorous and fungivorous nematodes, and if practiced in area with higher humidity, it could also potentially increase omnivorous and predatory nematodes. In conclusion, although <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost</b> amendment and drench did not suppress plant-parasitic nematodes, they had varying effects in improving soil health. Spent oyster <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost</b> as amendment and sometimes as drench increased bacterivorous and fungivorous nematodes, and if practiced in area with higher humidity, it could also potentially increase omnivorous and predatory nematodes. Overall, the benefits of oyster <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost</b> for suppression of plant-parasitic nematodes and improving soil health might take time. Continual practice of introducing <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost</b> waste in an agroecosystem might be needed to observe the benefits of this saprophytic fungus.

This industry produces a nutrient-rich byproduct known as spent <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost,</b> {{which has been}} traditionally applied to local farm fields as an organic fertilizer and soil amendment. While <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost</b> has beneficial properties, the possible over-application to farm fields could potentially degrade stream water quality. The goal {{of this study was}} to estimate the spatial extent and intensity of field-applied <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost.</b> We applied a remote sensing approach using Landsat multispectral imagery. We utilized the soil line technique, using the red and near-infrared bands, to estimate differences in soil wetness as a result of increased soil organic matter content from <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost.</b> We validated soil wetness estimates by examining the spectral response of references sites. We performed a second independent validation analysis using expert knowledge from agricultural extension agents. Our results showed that the soil line based wetness index worked well. The spectral validation illustrated that compost changes the spectral response of soil because of changes in wetness. The independent expert validation analysis produced a strong significant correlation between our remotely-sensed wetness estimates and the empirical ratings of compost application intensities.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{showed that}} the females of the mushroom sciarid, Lycoriella ingenua (Dufour, 1839) (Diptera: Sciaridae), {{one of the most}} severe pests of the cultivated white button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus (J. E. Lange) Emil J. Imbach (Agaricales: Agaricaceae), are attracted to the <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost</b> that mushrooms are grown on and not to the mushrooms themselves. We also showed that females are attracted to the parasitic green mold, Trichoderma aggressivum. In an attempt to identify what is in the <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost</b> that attracts female L. ingenua, we isolated several species of fungi from adult males and females, third instar larvae, and <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost</b> itself. We then analyzed the attraction of females to these substrates using a static-flow two choice olfactometer, as well as their oviposition tendencies in another type of assay under choice and no-choice conditions. We also assessed the survival of larvae to adulthood when first instar larvae were placed on each of the isolated fungal species. We found that female flies were attracted most to the mycoparasitic green mold, T. aggressivum, to Penicilium citrinum isolated from adult female bodies, and to Scatylidium thermophilium isolated from the <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost.</b> Gravid female flies laid the most eggs on T. aggressivum, Aspergillus flavus isolated from third instar larval frass, Aspergillus fumigatus isolated from adult male bodies, and on P. citrinum. This egg-laying trend remained consistent under no-choice conditions as females aged. First instar larvae developed to adulthood only on S. thermophilium and Chaetomium sp. isolated from <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost,</b> and on P. citrinum. Our results indicate that the volatiles from a suite of different fungal species act in tandem in the natural setting of <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost,</b> with some first attracting gravid female flies and then others causing them to oviposit. The ecological context of these findings is important for creating an optimal strategy for using possible semiochemicals isolated from these fungal species to better monitor and control this pestiferous mushroom fly species...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the factors}} that affect the yield of button {{mushrooms}} (Agaricus bisporus) is the quality of <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost.</b> To provide an optimal growth medium for mushrooms, {{it is important to understand}} the typical components of <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost.</b> The aims of this study were to isolate and identify volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and investigate patterns of change in selected VOCs during the different phases of the <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost</b> production process. Five batches of filling (Phase I), spawning (Phase II) and final stage (Phase III) of <b>mushroom</b> <b>compost</b> were analysed in triplicate. VOCs in the headspace of individual samples were collected with a 65 µm Polydimethylsiloxane/Divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB) SPME fibre and analysed by GC-MS. The VOCs detected in Phase I, II and III varied both in the total number present and total abundance. Among compounds detected, 2, 4 -Dimethylheptane, 5 -ethyl- 2 -methyloctane, 3, 7 -Dimethyldecane and n-butyl ether were common constituents of all phases. Alpha-pinene was also found in all samples except for one batch of Phase III. Beta-pinene and 3 -Carene were common and occurred in greater amount in Phase I and Phase II. The study revealed a higher amount of alkenes in Phase I and Phase II, while 3 -heptanone, 3 -octanone and 1 -octene dominated Phase III...|$|E
40|$|Vermicomposting {{using the}} {{earthworm}} Lumbricus rubellus was conducted for 70 days subsequent to 10 days of pre-composting under glasshouse conditions. Five treatments {{were used as}} feed materials with 5 replicates per treatment: T 1 : goat manure, T 2 : paddy straw, T 3 : spent <b>mushroom</b> paddy straw <b>compost,</b> T 4 : sawdust and T 5 : spent <b>mushroom</b> sawdust <b>compost.</b> The treatments were placed in a micro-cosm or worm bin plastic container (360 mm 280 mm 200 mm). The effectiveness of vermicomposting was evaluated through the increment of nutrient elements contained in the vermicompost, growth (biomass weight) and reproduction (total numbers) of earthworms, as a percentage, {{at the end of}} the process. The increment of macronutrients in the vermicompost from each treatment was high, especially of organic carbon (C) in T 1 and T 4, and nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and potassium (K) in T 3. Regarding micronutrients, copper (Cu) had the highest concentration in T 2 and zinc (Zn) in T 1 and T 2. Therefore, the best vermicompost as a soil fertilizer was T 3, which showed the highest increment and final content of N (+ 150. 73, 1. 50), P (+ 387. 75, 1. 06) and K (+ 886. 09, 2. 05). There was no significant difference between the number and weight of earthworms among the 5 treatments (P > 0. 05). A C: N ratio < 20 indicates the degree of compost maturity and post-vermicomposting, as noted for T 1 and T 3; T 1 had the lowest C: N ratio (9. 86). Based on our findings, the nutritive value of our vermicompost developed from selected agricultural wastes can be qualitatively assessed as a value-added material against fertilizers or soil stabilizers...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{utilization}} of seafood processing wastes for artificial cultivation of medicinal <b>mushroom</b> and <b>composting</b> in laboratory condition. Method: The selected agro-industrial wastes (e. g., coir pith, woodchips, sugarcane bagasse) were mixed with fishery waste in specific ratio (1 : 1). The substrates which are not mixed with fishery waste are regarded as control. All the above materials (1 : 1,control) were allowed to decompose about 15 days. The composted materials were placed in heat resistant transparent polyethylene bags. Each sterile bag was then aseptically inoculated with G. lucidum. The bags were then incubated under ambient temperature and controlled humidity. Results: The maximum biological yield per bed was obtained with sugarcane bagasse control bed 64. 78 g/bed. The lowest yield was observed in woodchips (1 : 1) 4. 6 g/bed. Based on mass obtained of G. lucidum the best substrates were ordered of like woodchips>coir>sugarcane. Conclusion: The scope of this work is sea food wastes {{could be used to}} cultivate a medicinal mushroom {{while at the same time}} promoting environmental sustainability...|$|R
