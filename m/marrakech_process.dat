Moreover, the United Nations is responsible for administrating the <b>Marrakech</b> <b>Process</b> and developing the ten-year Sustainable Consumption and Production Framework through Regional <b>Marrakech</b> <b>Process</b> Consultations, whose goal is to accelerate the shift towards sustainable consumption and production (SCP). Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)’s Environmental Directorate has also done comprehensive work on {{the environmental impacts of}} sustainable consumption and production. One of current OECD projects is reviewing measures for sustainable manufacturing production.|$|E

It includes a series of proposals on sustainable consumption and production to target EU goals for environmental sustainability, economic growth and public welfare, which are as follows: ...|$|E

40|$|As a {{contribution}} to the UN <b>Marrakech</b> <b>Process</b> on Sustainable Consumption and Production, the OECD identified effective government approaches for using various tools (regulations, taxes, labeling, education) to promote the sustainability of consumption in economic, environmental and social terms. In this study, sustainable refers to both the environmental (pollution, waste, resource use) and social (health, welfare) characteristics of products. It focuses on consumption by households and governments. It discusses government tools and instruments (eg. standards, taxes, subsidies, communications campaigns, education) put in place to encourage sustainable consumption. It also discusses approaches for protecting consumers from misleading information on sustainability in areas such as labelling, advertising and corporate reporting...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Asia Pacific {{region has}} been {{characterized}} with a rapidly expanding economy {{but at the same}} time increasing poverty and population which has created pressures on its limited resource base. Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) is a long-term strategy for sustainable development, as recognized in various United Nations Head of States meetings. This paper looks at the development of Sustainable Consumption and Production in the Asia Pacific region. It looks at the main stakeholders and regional initiatives within the region, outcomes of regional consultations through the platform of the Asia Pacific Roundtable for Sustainable Consumption and Production, analyzes the role of various National Cleaner Production Centres, describes national roundtables and their strategies and plans, reviews progress made since the <b>Marrakech</b> <b>Process</b> was launched in 2003, and identifies policy options for further development...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} for global environmental governance is "the problem of consumption. " The task involves far more than simply influencing what consumers choose, use, and discard. It requires a concerted effort to address the systemic drivers-including advertising, economic growth, technology, income inequality, corporations, population growth, and globalization-that shape the quantities, costs, and distribution of consumer goods. Current efforts to green consumption are "improving" management on many measures, such as per unit energy and resource use. Yet, this essay argues, such "progress" needs to be seen {{in the context of a}} rising global population and rising per capita consumption, where states and companies displace much of the costs of consumption far from those who are doing most of the consuming. This raises many questions about the value of sub-global measures for evaluating the environmental effectiveness of efforts to govern consumption. It also suggests the need for more global cooperation to mitigate the ecological effects of consumption. Current international initiatives such as the <b>Marrakech</b> <b>process</b> to draft a 10 -Year Framework on "sustainable production and consumption," however, will need to go well beyond simply promoting efficiencies, new technologies, and a greening of household consumption. Researchers in global environmental politics can assist here by probing even further into the complexity of governing the drivers and consequences of consumption, then working to thread these findings into the international policy process.

40|$|The Partnership for Education and Research about Responsible Living (PERL) {{comprises}} educators, {{researchers and}} practitioners from over 120 institutions {{in more than}} 50 countries. This partnership stems from {{an awareness of the}} urgent need for individuals and society to significantly rethink and reorient the choices they make {{and the manner in which}} they live their lives in order to reduce the negative impacts of climate change and financial instability, to ensure more just distribution of resources and to foster sustainable, dignified human development for all. Based on six years of work by the Consumer Citizenship Network (CCN), PERL partners develop projects, methods and materials to encourage people to contribute to constructive change through the way they choose to live. PERL is contributing to the <b>Marrakech</b> <b>Process</b> on Sustainable Consumption and Production, as well as to the UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (2005 - 2014), which boasts the active participation of UNEP, UNESCO, the Italian Task Force on Education for Sustainable Consumption and the Swedish Ministry of the Environment. PERL is based both in Europe as an Erasmus Academic Network and established in Asia Pacific, Africa and Latin America. The PERL network is a large multi-disciplinary organisation which has a core of working group members supported by a larger group which constitutes the Consultants network. PERL is coordinated from the Hedmark University College in Norway. The Norwegian Ministry of Children, Equality and Social Inclusion also supports PERL. One of the PERL working groups is focusing on ‘Active Learning Methodologies’ and its objectives are to develop resources that build on the criteria and student-centred constructive methods of the original “Images and Objects” Active Methodology Toolkit and the YouthXchange Training Kit. peer-reviewe...|$|E
