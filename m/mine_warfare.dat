5|$|The Albona {{class was}} {{a class of}} <b>mine</b> <b>warfare</b> ships used by the Regia Marina (Royal Italian Navy) and Royal Yugoslav Navy (JKRM). Fourteen ships were {{originally}} laid down between 1917 and 1918 for the Austro-Hungarian Navy as the MT.130 class. However, the end of World War I and the dissolution of Austria-Hungary left them incomplete until 1920, when three ships were finished for the Regia Marina. An additional five ships were completed for the JKRM in 1931 as the Malinska class.|$|E
50|$|Because troop {{movements}} in World War II were too fluid, and tunneling too slow, <b>mining</b> <b>warfare</b> was {{of little use}} during that conflict.|$|R
50|$|In trench warfare with heavily {{fortified}} strongholds, {{the tactic}} of digging and mining the enemy positions {{was used in}} the American Civil War during the Siege of Petersburg and the Russo-Japanese War during the Siege of Port Arthur. Extensive <b>mining</b> <b>warfare</b> was conducted by German, French, British and Australian troops on the Western Front during World War I, where the largely static frontlines created favourable conditions for mining.|$|R

5|$|There are {{two parts}} to the RAN's structure. One is an {{operational}} command, Fleet Command, {{and the other}} is a support command, Navy Strategic Command. The Navy's assets are administered by four 'forces' which report to the Commander Australian Fleet. These are the Fleet Air Arm, the <b>Mine</b> <b>Warfare,</b> Clearance Diving, Hydrographic, Meteorological and Patrol Force, Submarine Force and Surface Force. All naval bases across Australia also report to the Commander Australian Fleet.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} service, Nautilus and Albatross alternated between {{service with}} the High Seas Fleet; Nautilus {{participated in the}} annual fleet maneuvers in 1907 and 1908, {{and was replaced by}} Albatross thereafter. Nautilus was modernized at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Kiel in 190910, and Albatross underwent a similar modernization there in 191011. While Albatross was out of service, Nautilus temporarily returned to the fleet. Once the former's refit was completed in 1911, the latter was transferred to <b>mine</b> <b>warfare</b> training in the North Sea before being decommissioned {{at the end of the}} year. Albatross remained in service through 1914, but apart from a collision with the steamer , the time passed uneventfully.|$|E
5|$|Hayward assumed {{command of}} the Naval Ordnance Laboratory at White Oak, Maryland in June 1954. He was the first naval aviator to do so, all the {{previous}} commanders having been naval ordnance officers. Under his guidance, the Naval Ordnance Laboratory developed the Mark 52 naval mine, an air-delivered weapon with acoustic, magnetic and pressure sensors. Hayward encountered some resistance with this project, as <b>mine</b> <b>warfare</b> was a neglected field in the Navy. The Naval Ordnance Laboratory also developed the Mark 90 nuclear bomb, a nuclear depth charge, which was tested during Operation Wigwam in May 1955.|$|E
5000|$|The concept {{behind the}} {{littoral}} combat ship, {{as described by}} former Secretary of the Navy Gordon R. England, is to [...] "create a small, fast, maneuverable and relatively inexpensive member of the DD(X) family of ships." [...] The ship is easy to reconfigure for different roles, including anti-submarine <b>warfare,</b> <b>mine</b> countermeasures, anti-surface <b>warfare,</b> intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, homeland defense, maritime intercept, special operations, and logistics. Due to its modular design, the LCS {{will be able to}} replace slower, more specialized ships such as minesweepers and larger assault ships.|$|R
25|$|Air {{pollution}} {{comes from}} {{both natural and}} human-made (anthropogenic) sources. However, globally human-made pollutants from combustion, construction, <b>mining,</b> agriculture and <b>warfare</b> are increasingly significant in the air pollution equation.|$|R
50|$|Although {{these three}} {{countries}} {{suffer from the}} same problem, they have never unified their diplomatic engagements with the formerly belligerent countries, Italy, Germany, and Great Britain. This weakened their positions in demanding the extraction of the mines, and compensation for war damages. Libya and Egypt work apart. Tunisia signed the Ottawa Treaty in December 1997, calling for banning the use of <b>mines</b> in <b>warfare,</b> but this signing will not save its people from the danger of mines.|$|R
5|$|The Royal Australian Navy {{today is}} a {{medium-sized}} modern navy in world terms but {{is one of the}} strongest navies in the Asia Pacific Region. Today, the combat fleet of the RAN is made up of eight s, four s, fourteen patrol boats of the , and six s. The RAN also comprises an amphibious and supply force to transport the Australian Army and to resupply the combat arm of the navy. The RAN is divided into seven Force Element Groups (FEGs): Surface Combatants, Amphibious Warfare Forces and Afloat Support Force, Naval Aviation, Submarine Force, <b>Mine</b> <b>Warfare</b> and Clearance Diving, Patrol Boat Force and the Hydrographic Force. The FEG's were formed to manage the operations of the separate sections of the RAN in a more efficient way.|$|E
5|$|The {{two ships}} {{served with the}} High Seas Fleet after {{entering}} service, with {{only one in the}} fleet at a time, usually trading service with the fleet either for refits or <b>mine</b> <b>warfare</b> training. After the start of World War I, the ships laid several minefields, both to protect the German coast and also to interfere with British naval operations. In 1915, Albatross was transferred to the Baltic Sea to operate against the Russian Baltic Fleet, where she was eventually ambushed by Russian cruisers and forced to beach in the Battle of Åland Islands in July. Nautilus took part in Operation Albion in 1917 and was rearmed in 1918 to support amphibious operations, but she did not see action in that role.|$|E
5|$|In early September 1917, {{following}} the German {{conquest of the}} Russian port of Riga, the German navy decided to eliminate the Russian naval forces that still held the Gulf of Riga. The Admiralstab (Navy High Command) planned an operation to seize the Baltic island of Ösel, and specifically the Russian gun batteries on the Sworbe Peninsula. On 18 September, the order was issued for a joint operation with the army to capture Ösel and Moon Islands; the primary naval component was to comprise the flagship, Moltke, along with the III and IVBattle Squadrons of the High Seas Fleet. The IISquadron consisted of the four König-class ships, and was by this time augmented with the new battleship Bayern. The IVSquadron consisted of the five Kaiser-class battleships. Along with nine light cruisers, three torpedo boat flotillas, and dozens of <b>mine</b> <b>warfare</b> ships, the entire force numbered some 300 ships, supported by over 100 aircraft and six zeppelins. The invasion force amounted to approximately 24,600 officers and enlisted men.|$|E
50|$|The {{resultant}} static warfare {{meant that}} tunnelling saw a brief resurgence {{as a military}} tactic. As in siege <b>warfare,</b> <b>mining</b> was possible {{due to the nature}} of the fighting. Secondly, the ground on the Western Front was a prime candidate for underground warfare.|$|R
50|$|Capable of {{speeds of}} up to 40kts, Bonefish is {{designed}} to incorporate {{a wide range of}} sensors, satellite-based control and a modular payload bay to enable role flexibility. Potential missions could include anti-piracy, maritime surveillance, anti-submarine <b>warfare,</b> <b>mine</b> countermeasures, search and rescue, and hydrography.|$|R
50|$|His {{expertise}} {{as a war}} engineer {{came into}} play again during the Italian War of 1494-98, {{when he was in}} the employ of Ferdinand II of Naples. He used tunnels and explosives in what is considered the pioneering use of <b>mining</b> technology for <b>warfare.</b>|$|R
5|$|While largely {{forced on}} Graham by the {{inadequate}} forces available and the inherent contradictions of Australian strategic policy, his decision was {{contrary to the}} advice of the senior task force engineer, Major Brian Florence. A number of senior infantry officers had also resisted the idea, including one of Graham's battalion commanders, Lieutenant Colonel John Warr, commanding officer 5 RAR, who had served in the Korean War where the Australians had suffered a large number of casualties from mines originally laid by other UN forces. Yet unlike many of his colleagues, as an Armoured Corps officer Graham had not served in Korea, and many of the assumptions he developed about <b>mine</b> <b>warfare</b> in North Africa had remained unchallenged. For the first six months the barrier minefield had resulted in a dramatic decline in Viet Cong infiltration, reducing re-supply movement by up to 80 percent. However, recognising the threat the obstacle posed to them, the Viet Cong had immediately begun attempting to penetrate it, cutting gaps in the fence and clearing lanes through the minefield to restore the flow of supplies, as well as lifting mines for their own use. Conceived to hinder the movement of the Viet Cong between their jungle bases and the villages on which they relied for supplies, the failure of South Vietnamese forces to protect the barrier minefield ultimately allowed the Viet Cong to remove thousands of mines, many of which were subsequently used against 1 ATF. While in keeping with the orthodoxy of Australian counter-insurgency doctrine, Graham's strategy ultimately proved both controversial and costly, and despite initial success, the minefield became a source of munitions for the Viet Cong and later {{the decision was made to}} remove it amid growing casualties.|$|E

In 1956, she {{was assigned to the}} Yorktown, Virginia, <b>Mine</b> <b>Warfare</b> School, followed in August by assignment to Norfolk, Virginia, to participate in Operation Hideaway. In 1957, Thrush moved to her new homeport in Key West, Florida, where she tested and evaluated new <b>mine</b> <b>warfare</b> equipment for the 6th Naval District's <b>Mine</b> <b>Warfare</b> Evaluation Detachment.|$|E

50|$|In 1999, {{while under}} the command of Mark D. Jenkins, Los Angeles was {{modified}} to carry a Dry Deck Shelter (DDS). Her capabilities included undersea warfare, surface <b>warfare,</b> strike <b>warfare,</b> <b>mining</b> operations, special forces delivery, reconnaissance, carrier battle group support and escort, and intelligence collection.|$|R
25|$|Principal {{capabilities}} include shallow-water anti-submarine <b>warfare,</b> <b>mine</b> countermeasures {{and defense}} against attacking small boats.

50|$|Originally used as {{agricultural}} tools as {{far back}} as prehistoric cultures, picks have also served for tasks ranging from traditional <b>mining</b> to <b>warfare.</b> The design has also evolved into other tools such as the plough and the mattock. In prehistoric times a large shed deer antler from a suitable species (e.g. red deer) was often cut down to its shaft and its lowest tine and used as a one-pointed pick, and with it sometimes a large animal's shoulder blade as a crude shovel.During war in medieval times, the pickaxe was used as a weapon.|$|R

40|$|Roughly {{half the}} world 2 ̆ 7 s {{population}} speaks languages derived from a shared linguistic source known as Proto-Indo-European. But who were the early speakers of this ancient mother tongue, {{and how did they}} manage to spread it around the globe? Until now their identity has remained a tantalizing mystery to linguists, archaeologists, and even Nazis seeking the roots of the Aryan race. The Horse, the Wheel, and Language lifts the veil that has long shrouded these original Indo-European speakers, and reveals how their domestication of horses and use of the wheel spread language and transformed civilization. Linking prehistoric archaeological remains with the development of language, David Anthony identifies the prehistoric peoples of central Eurasia 2 ̆ 7 s steppe grasslands as the original speakers of Proto-Indo-European, and shows how their innovative use of the ox wagon, horseback riding, and the warrior 2 ̆ 7 s chariot turned the Eurasian steppes into a thriving transcontinental corridor of communication, commerce, and cultural exchange. He explains how they spread their traditions and gave rise to important advances in copper <b>mining,</b> <b>warfare,</b> and patron-client political institutions, thereby ushering in an era of vibrant social change. Anthony also describes his fascinating discovery of how the wear from bits on ancient horse teeth reveals the origins of horseback riding. The Horse, the Wheel, and Language solves a puzzle that has vexed scholars for two centuries [...] the source of the Indo-European languages and English [...] and recovers a magnificent and influential civilization from the past.

5000|$|The U.S. Air Force {{component}} of the force was the 85th Group. The air forces stationed in Iceland included a rotational P-3 Orion patrol squadron deployed forward from the U.S. Navy's Patrol Wings Atlantic, and the F-15s of the 85th Group. Commander Dennis Corrigan, Fleet Air Keflavik's operations officer, commented to Jane's Defence Weekly in 1996 that 'Keflavik {{is the only place}} where a US Navy flag officer has both P-3s and USAF F-15s working for him[...].We have developed a joint tactical doctrine: F-15s providing air superiority to allow the P-3 to do its job, whether its <b>mining,</b> anti-submarine <b>warfare</b> or something else.' With the reduction in Patrol Wings Atlantic to ultimately seven squadrons by 1994, commitments at NAS Roosevelt Roads and Sigonella were reallocated, with Patrol Wings, Pacific taking up the Caribbean tasking to allow a full complement of P-3s in Sicily.|$|R
50|$|In 1956-57, 1958, and 1959, Fort Marion made {{additional}} deployments to {{the western}} Pacific, taking part in <b>mine</b> and amphibious <b>warfare</b> operations, and {{in the summer of}} 1958, joining in emergency operations to meet the threat posed by renewed Communist shelling of the Nationalist-held offshore islands. In September, serving with the Taiwan Patrol Force, she brought supplies to Quemoy under Communist fire. Fort Marion spent much of 1960 in an extensive modernization overhaul which added many useful years to her expected span of service, and on 22 November sailed for Far Eastern duty once more.|$|R
