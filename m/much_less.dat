5|$|Mephedrone is a monoamine {{releasing}} agent. It is a chiral {{compound and}} both of its enantiomers display similar potency as substrates at dopamine transporters. R-Mephedrone is <b>much</b> <b>less</b> potent than S-mephedrone as a substrate at serotonin transporters.|$|E
50|$|RS-M95 Tape Deck: This deck {{replaced}} the 9600 {{in the same}} way as the 9000 Professional Series components {{replaced the}} 9600. It was <b>much</b> smaller, <b>less</b> expensive ($1400) and had better specs than the RS-9900US it replaced, resulting in better sound.|$|R
50|$|In a {{population}} estimate made in an areca plantation in the Western Ghats, the density {{was found to}} be about 13 per hectare. The population density was <b>much</b> lower, <b>less</b> than 2 per hectare, at Valparai which is at a higher altitude.|$|R

5|$|The MSR was an S-band passive {{electronically}} scanned array (PESA), {{unlike the}} actively scanned MAR. A PESA system cannot (normally) generate multiple signals like AESA, but is <b>much</b> <b>less</b> expensive to build because a single {{transmitter and receiver}} {{is used for the}} entire system. The same antenna array can easily be used for both transmitting and receiving, as the area behind the array is <b>much</b> <b>less</b> cluttered and has ample room for switching in spite of the large radio frequency switches needed at this level of power.|$|E
