40|$|The {{elimination}} of hot spots and {{the reduction of}} eddy current losses in <b>bushing</b> <b>mounting</b> plates is an important consideration in transformer design. The currently used <b>bushing</b> <b>mounting</b> plates are either mild steel plates, or mild steel plates with non-magnetic stainless steel inserts or stainless steel plates. The authors calculate the eddy current losses in <b>bushing</b> <b>mounting</b> plates using four different methods; (i) an analytical formulation; (ii) a three-dimensional finite element method (FEM); (iii) from measured values of the initial temperature rise; and (iv) from measured values of the steady-state temperature rise. There is a close agreement between the loss values obtained using these four methods. The analysis {{has resulted in a}} detailed understanding of the loss pattern and temperature rise phenomenon in <b>bushing</b> <b>mounting</b> plates. The authors also analyse tank plates of small pad-mounted distribution transformers. It is shown that judicious use of non-magnetic stainless steel can result in considerable energy savings for pad-mounted transformers. FEM simulations are performed to find out cost-effective materials for the tank plates of the pad-mounted transformers. A T-shaped stainless steel plate is found to significantly reduce the load loss. The results of the simulations have been verified on a 225 kVA pad-mounted transformer...|$|R

50|$|The {{familiar}} {{range of}} PSA powertrains drove {{the front wheels}} of a conventionally designed chassis. At the front was a standard MacPherson strut layout with anti-roll bar, while the rear used the PSA Peugeot-Citroën independent trailing arm/torsion bar set up that was first introduced on the Peugeot 305 estate. However, PSA's chassis engineers employed some unusual features, including passive rear wheel steering, though less than on the ZX, (by means of specially designed compliance bushes in the rear suspension), and in-house developed and constructed shock absorbers. At high mileages this is prone to wear of the axle <b>mounting</b> <b>bushes</b> which is easily fixed. It is also prone to wear in the rear axle trailing arm bearings, which then wear the trailing arm axle tubes, requiring an expensive rebuild or a replacement axle assembly.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was designed by}} Webb Scheutzow around {{a new type of}} rotorhead that he had developed, the FLEXIHUB. In this system, the two main rotor blades were <b>mounted</b> in rubber <b>bushes,</b> reducing vibration and requiring no lubrication. The design was otherwise entirely conventional, consisting of a cabin with two seats arranged side-by-side, a centrally-mounted engine and rotor mast, and an open-truss tail boom of triangular section that carried a two-blade tail rotor. The undercarriage consisted of skids. The frame was constructed of welded steel tube and the cabin was constructed of sheet metal. Power was transmitted from the engine to the rotor by a series of belts, eliminating the need for a gearbox and minimizing cabin noise.|$|R
50|$|The {{land area}} of the {{municipality}} is 99 km². The relief is composed, on the North side, of the Ottawa River plain and, on the South side, of Mount Rigaud. The Ottawa River and Mount Rigaud are the main elements in the landscape. The plain is partly used for agricultural purposes and partly in <b>bush.</b> <b>Mount</b> Rigaud covers an area of 47 km². A lot of rock pieces scatter the woods all over the mountain. It is a moraine shaped by a glacier that, by moving, broke up from the bedrock of the Canadian Shield, fragments that it disaggregated and rounded by rolling over them, moving them and leaving them in this basin, some thousand years ago, {{at the end of}} the Wisconsin glaciation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:––Road noise {{inside a}} vehicle’s {{passenger}} compartment {{is caused by}} many sources. The most common is tyre rumble generated by contact of the tyres with the road surface. Other causes of low frequency noise are the vehicle’s engine and power train and structural vibration (caused by vibration of the suspension or vehicle body). Road noise is transmitted through the vehicle into the vehicle cabin via two distinct paths: through the air (airborne noise) and through the vehicle’s bodywork (structure-borne noise). These paths are primarily governed by {{the frequency of the}} noise. Transfer path analysis is widely used terminology in noise, vibration and harshness of automobiles. It is a technique for identifying the vibro-acoustic transfer paths from the source to receiver through physical connections such as engine <b>mounts</b> or <b>bushes.</b> This paper describes a methodology of component sensitivity which is used for finding the critical transfer paths by using DOE (Design of Experiment) technique. Component sensitivity is a measure of change in response due to change in any component of the system i. e. change in stiffness of mounts/bushes. By performing design of experiments, critical transfer path is identified. The sound pressure level is reduced by varying the stiffness of bushes.

5000|$|The {{design of}} the car was {{conservative}} with a pressed steel body built on a ladder chassis. The chassis was designed to give a low overall height to the car by dipping down by 2.75 inches (70 mm) between the axles. The 1125-cc four-cylinder side-valve engine producing [...] drove the rear wheels through a four-speed gearbox and open drive shaft to a live rear axle. Steering was by worm and wheel. Suspension was by half-elliptic springs all round <b>mounted</b> on silent-bloc <b>bushes</b> and damped by frictional shock absorbers. The four-wheel brakes were cable and rod operated by pedal or by hand lever on the offside of the speed lever. The electrical system was 6 volt. For the first year only, a four-door saloon was made in two versions. The basic model cost £155 and was capable of reaching 55 mph with an economy of 34 and the Sunshine or De-Luxe with opening roof and leather upholstery at £168. Bumpers were provided. The chassis was priced at £120.|$|R
40|$|A dynamic tester {{for testing}} {{vibration}} damping seals and bearings is constructed having a hollow shaft extending through the seal or bearing, with the shaft internally supported {{at each end}} by fluid bearings on hollow bosses connected to an interior of an enclosure, with no rolling members connected to the shaft is described. A high pressure working fluid is forced through the hollow bosses to operate the bearings. Additionally, the shaft is provided with a reaction turbine that angularly vents {{a portion of the}} high pressure working fluid in order to rotate the shaft at high speed, up to 40, 000 rpm. The seal or bearing is <b>mounted</b> in a <b>bushing,</b> in turn supported by rods to a shaking device that vibrates the seal or bearing as the shaft is rotated. A plurality of proximity sensors are mounted from outside the enclosure to sense shaft and seal bushing vibrations, and a plurality of pressure ports are disposed in the enclosure to allow sensing of dynamic and static pressures of the testing apparatus...|$|R
50|$|The Gyroxus {{is made up}} of {{two basic}} parts; the seat and the base. The seat is {{suspended}} on the base by four cables at an angle which gives the impression that the pivot point is several feet below the bottom of the seat. This lower pivot point makes the gamer's head move more in relation to the movement of the seat in order to increase the sensation of motion. There is a control arm mounted to the seat, and a connecting rod mounted between the seat and the base. This connecting rod is firmly attached to the seat, but at the base it is <b>mounted</b> through a <b>bushing</b> which allows it to slide up and down as the seat is moved. By moving the control arm, the gamer uses the connecting rod to leverage the seat against the base, causing the seat to move in the direction in which the control arm is moved. A sensor mounted to the seat reads the X and Y movement and sends those X/Y coordinates to the controller, which in turn sends them to the game. All of this happens in real time so there is no more lag using the Gyroxus than there would be just using the left thumbstick.|$|R
40|$|In the {{automotive}} industry, multi-axis shaker tables {{are often used}} to study {{the damage caused by}} motion-induced inertia loads to components such as engine mounts or fuel tank strips. To assess the component durability characteristics using this approach, prototype parts must be built and a test rig must be installed. This process is both time and budget consuming, so there is an incentive {{to reduce the number of}} physical shaking tests. To that end, this thesis introduces a set of software tools that are capable of conducting virtual shaking simulations with quality output results, i. e., a virtual multi-axial shaker table (VMAST). By refining and reproducing vehicle body acceleration signals collected from the proving grounds, the VMAST is able to replay the body motion of a vehicle. The reproduced motion (drive file) can then be used to drive the virtual dynamic shaking. With the additional consideration of vehicle body local flexibility, the flexible motion can be added to the rigid body motion to improve the simulation accuracy. The dynamic shaking simulation can be done natively in MATLAB, or the drive files derived from MATLAB can be used by other commercial software, such as Altair MotionView. The virtual load data acquisition of the engine <b>bushing</b> <b>mount</b> is implemented during the simulation to predict the fatigue index, which can be referenced in the design procedure. This VMAST provides {{the automotive}} engineer with a cost effective tool for analysis, and optimizes the testing process, allowing rapid design iteration...|$|R
50|$|Built by the Ford Motorsport (Ford TeamRS) {{works at}} Boreham, Essex, The Rally Ka was {{designed}} as an entry-level vehicle {{to compete in a}} one-make series as part of the British Mintex rally championship. The Ka Championship in 1997 with just four cars in the debut Granite City Rally event. In 1998 fifteen competitors undertook the Mintex challenge. Ford's Boreham airfield facility provides a complete build service for competitors wishing to rally Ka. Most of the parts supplied are concerned with strengthening the car for rallying. Uprated engine <b>mounts</b> and suspension <b>bushes</b> are all included, as is a front strut brace. Aluminium sump and fuel tank guards, OZ Rally wheels and a Safety Devices bolt-in roll cage are all either fitted by the Boreham works or supplied to individual teams. Performance-enhancing modifications are limited to the addition of a Rally spec engine control unit, camshaft and 4-into-2-into-1 extractor set attached to a free-flowing exhaust. This combination lifts power to , and to cope with it competitors are encouraged to fit the optional uprated drive shafts with larger CV joints. A limited-slip differential and heavier clutch plate are also available. A competition brake package consisting of Mintex pads gripping vented front brake rotors and stronger rear drums is homologated for Rally Ka. Replacing the original shock absorbers is a set of four remote-reservoir Proflex coil-over struts adjustable for compression and rebound damping. These are allied to a lowering kit and adjustable spring platforms to give Ka competitors a wide range of suspension settings including ride height. Inside the Rally Ka is all business. In true rally fashion gone are all but the essentials: the two central eyeball vents are replaced by a tachometer and auxiliary gauge. Even the replacement panels in the dashboard which support the fire extinguisher button and extra switches and gauges required in a rally car are listed in the Boreham parts schedule. A deeply dished rally steering wheel, competition seats and harnesses are all supplied from the kit and replacements are not allowed.|$|R
