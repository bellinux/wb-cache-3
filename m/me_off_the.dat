500|$|Peel, having {{concluded}} that the suspension would end his Yorkshire career, signed a contract to play for Accrington Cricket Club. He told a newspaper that he regarded his suspension as unfair, {{that he had been}} given no opportunity to explain, and that he had taken the appointment with Accrington to provide for himself and his family. In 1900, he told Cricket magazine that, before his suspension, he had been bedridden for three weeks {{as a result of an}} injury he suffered while batting, that he played against Middlesex with some success and was then suspended without any explanation. He later said of the incident: [...] " [...] put his arm around me and escorted <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> field and out of Yorkshire cricket. What a gentleman". The journalist Harry Pearson suggests that this was [...] "either very gracious, or exceedingly sarcastic." [...] Hawke later described Peel's sacking as [...] "the most decisive action of my whole career... It had to be done for the sake of discipline and the good of cricket. Nothing ever gave me so much pain." [...] At the time, Hawke believed these events cost Yorkshire the County Championship, but the team had only two more games to play in that season's competition, and it was mathematically impossible for them to win. Hirst told Thompson that Hawke was always sorry that Peel had to be sacked, and that whenever the pair met afterwards, they remained friends and that neither bore the other any animosity. Although Peel considered himself indispensable, the following year he was replaced by Wilfred Rhodes, who remained in the team until 1930 and took 4,184 first-class wickets. Peel remained popular with the people of Morley in the aftermath of his dismissal, and they supported him rather than believing the reports.|$|E

In 1974, when he was fifteen, King met his future Level 42 bandmate Phil Gould, who remembers that the young King [...] "came and sat in with the band that I formed, at one of the gigs we were doing. [...] He brought his kit down and blew me off, blew <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> stage because he was so much faster than me." [...] Gould also remembers the young King as being a budding multi-instrumentalist, a [...] "really good guitarist" [...] who would [...] "play around with programming, synth stuff.

She began singing R songs at local contests and fairs while attending Soldan High School from which she graduated in 1958. At 17, she started her professional career working at the Showboat Club near Chain of Rocks, Missouri. In 1961, she auditioned on a dare for the Leon Claxton carnival show and was hired to play piano and sing in the chorus for two weeks, making $175 per week for the two weeks it was in town. She wanted to go on tour with Claxton but her mother refused and according to Bass [...] "... she literally dragged <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> train".

2500|$|Conley {{said the}} album was [...] "more {{aggressive}} and more dark" [...] compared to In Reverie, and that paranoia was the main lyrical theme behind it. He described [...] "Head for the Hills" [...] as being [...] "thoughts that creep up and swallow you, and you can't ignore the negative, the hell inside". Conley said [...] "Don't Know Why [...] my blues. It's one of those songs that keeps <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ledge personally. I sing it to myself {{all the time when}} I'm at home alone." [...] On the album's sound, Conley revealed that the group purposefully [...] "kept it simple," [...] relying solely on two guitars, bass and drums, attempting to create [...] "a raw album" [...] in the process. After finishing recording the material, Conley referred to it as [...] "quite different" [...] compared to In Reverie. The album's sound has been described as emo, pop, pop punk and power pop.|$|E
2500|$|Byrne revitalized the {{slumping}} {{title with}} his run. Originally, Byrne was slated to write with Sienkiewicz providing the art. Sienkiewicz {{left to do}} Moon Knight, and Byrne ended up as writer, artist, and inker. Various editors {{were assigned to the}} comic; eventually Bob Budiansky became the regular editor. Byrne told Jim Shooter that he could not work with Budiansky, although they ultimately continued to work together. In 2006, Byrne said [...] "that's my paranoia. I look back and I think that was Shooter trying to force <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> book". Byrne left following issue #293 (Aug. 1986) {{in the middle of a}} story arc, explaining he could not recapture the fun he had previously had on the series. One of Byrne's changes was making the Invisible Girl into the Invisible Woman: assertive and confident. During this period, fans came to recognize that she was quite powerful, whereas previously, she had been primarily seen as a superpowered mother and wife in the tradition of television moms like those played by Donna Reed and Florence Henderson.|$|E
