5000|$|In 2003, another MSC {{restructuring}} amalgamated the PSPC, the PAAWC {{and all of}} the 11 remaining Canadian Environmental Services Centres {{into five}} Storm Prediction Centres; adopting the naming convention and forecasting approach pioneered five years earlier by the PSPC. The public and <b>marine</b> <b>forecast</b> and warning responsibilities from the PSPC and the PAAWC were combined into the new Prairie and Arctic Storm Prediction Centre (PASPC). The aviation responsibilities for all of western Canada and the Arctic now fell under the responsibility of the new Canadian Meteorological Aviation Centre (CMAC - West). The Yukon Territory forecasts were transferred from Kelowna to the renamed Pacific Storm Prediction Centre in Vancouver. The PASPC amalgamation was preceded with controversy. Leaked information prior to the official announcement indicated that only five public and marine weather forecast offices across the country would remain open. [...] The information indicated that the Winnipeg location, home of the Prairie Storm Prediction Centre, was to close and that all of its forecasting responsibilities would move to the new PASPC in Edmonton.

40|$|Our {{long-range}} {{objectives are}} {{to encourage and}} facilitate the incorporation of improved aerodynamic bulk formula into operational <b>marine</b> <b>forecast</b> models and demonstrate the <b>marine</b> <b>forecast</b> sensitivity to coupled boundary layer parameterizations. OBJECTIVES The main objective of this proposal is to explore the physical processes of the air-sea coupling that {{may be responsible for}} accurate simulation of tropical convective cloud systems and SST on the diurnal to synoptic time scales over the western Pacific warm pool. In this exploratory study we propose to examine the model sensitivity to an interactively coupled non-advective upper ocean mixed layer model with a full three-dimensional high resolution atmospheric model. We will explore how changes in the coupled boundary layer parameterizations and two-way air-sea coupling may impact forecast fields. APPROACH Observations have shown that the convective cloud systems and precipitation in the equatorial western Pacific have a pronounced diurnal cycle (e. g., Gray and Jacobson, 1977; Janowick et al., 1994; Chen and Houze, 1997).

40|$|The new pelagic Operational Observatory of the Catalan Sea (OOCS) for the coordinated {{multisensor}} {{measurement of}} atmospheric and oceanographic conditions has been recently installed (2009) in the Catalan Sea (41 ° 39 ′N, 2 ° 54 ′E; Western Mediterranean) and continuously operated (with minor maintenance gaps) until today. This multiparametric platform is moored at 192 m depth, 9. 3 km off Blanes harbour (Girona, Spain). It {{is composed of}} a buoy holding atmospheric sensors {{and a set of}} oceanographic sensors measuring the water conditions over the upper 100 m depth. The station is located close {{to the head of the}} Blanes submarine canyon where an important multispecies pelagic and demersal fishery gives the station ecological and economic relevance. The OOCS provides important records on atmospheric and oceanographic conditions, the latter through the measurement of hydrological and biogeochemical parameters, at depths with a time resolution never attained before for this area of the Mediterranean. Twenty four moored sensors and probes operating in a coordinated fashion provide important data on Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs; UNESCO) such as temperature, salinity, pressure, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll fluorescence, and turbidity. In comparison with other pelagic observatories presently operating in other world areas, OOCS also measures photosynthetic available radiation (PAR) from above the sea surface and at different depths in the upper 50 m. Data are recorded each 30 min and transmitted in real-time to a ground station via GPRS. This time series is published and automatically updated at the frequency of data collection on the official OOCS website ([URL] Under development are embedded automated routines for the in situ data treatment and assimilation into numerical models, in order to provide a reliable local marine processing forecast. In this work, our goal is to detail the OOCS multisensor architecture in relation to the coordinated capability for the remote, continuous and prolonged monitoring of atmospheric and oceanographic conditions, including data communication and storage. Accordingly, time series of measurements for a number of biological parameters will be presented for the summer months of 2011. Marine hindcast outputs from the numerical models implemented for simulating the conditions over the study area are shown. The strong changes of atmospheric conditions recorded in the last years over the area have altered the marine conditions of living organisms, but the dimension of the impact remains unclear.
