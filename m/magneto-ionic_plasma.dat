40|$|Abstract. A new {{scenario}} is explored {{to understand the}} striking depolarization asymmtery observed between the two lobes of powerful radio sources exhibiting one-sided jets. According to this tight correlation, {{commonly known as the}} Laing-Garrington effect, the lobe on the counter-jet side is found to depolarize more rapidly at longer radio wavelengths, compared to the opposite lobe. Conventionally, this is explained by postulating that distant radio sources are embedded within large halos of dense <b>magneto-ionic</b> <b>plasma,</b> with typical dimensions of the core of intra-cluster medium (ICM). Pointing out potential problems with this scheme, we argue that the depolarization asymmetry, instead of arising from the putative ICM cores at high redshifts, could occur more commonly due to extended disks of dusty magneto-ionic medium surrounding elliptical galaxies hosting quasars. Differring radically in their physical origin from the postulated ICM haloes, such disks are likely to have been acquired in the events of capture of gas-rich galaxies, or their progenitors, by massive radio-loud ellipticals. Radio and optical evidences for such disks are summarized and some aspects of their evolution are briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|Low-frequency {{polarisation}} {{observations of}} pulsars, facilitated by next-generation radio telescopes, provide powerful probes of astrophysical plasmas that span many {{orders of magnitude}} in magnetic field strength and scale: from pulsar magnetospheres to intervening <b>magneto-ionic</b> <b>plasmas</b> including the ISM and the ionosphere. Pulsar magnetospheres with teragauss field strengths can be explored through their numerous emission phenomena across multiple frequencies, the mechanism behind which remains elusive. Precise dispersion and Faraday rotation measurements towards {{a large number of}} pulsars probe the three-dimensional large-scale (and eventually small-scale) structure of the Galactic magnetic field, which plays a role in many astrophysical processes, but is not yet well understood, especially towards the Galactic halo. We describe some results and ongoing work from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) radio telescopes in these areas. These and other pathfinder and precursor telescopes have reinvigorated low-frequency science and build towards the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), which will make significant advancements in studies of astrophysical magnetic fields in the next 50 years.
