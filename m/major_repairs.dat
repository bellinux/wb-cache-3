5|$|<b>Major</b> <b>repairs</b> {{were carried}} out to the spire in 1946–47 under the {{supervision}} of architect Kenneth Dalgleish, following damage sustained during the Second World War. In 1957, the bells were again repaired. On 25 August 1959, the church was added to the register of listed buildings. It is Grade I listed. The clock was repaired in 1972 in memory of George Prentice, rector of Mereworth from 1966–70. A new fibreglass clock face was fitted at this time and the winding mechanism converted to electric power. In 2005, an inspection revealed that the church needed <b>major</b> <b>repairs.</b> English Heritage made a grant that covered 95% of the £500,000 cost of restoration.

5|$|In the Maylands {{industrial}} area the worst affected buildings were the Northgate Information Solutions headquarters and the Fujifilm building. These buildings were so badly damaged they were rendered completely unusable.

Although the Northgate and Fujifilm buildings were closest to the blast, the surrounding Catherine House (to the north), Keystone Distribution building (to the west), 3Com Corporation and RO buildings (to the south), were also extensively damaged.

He could only claim damaged enemy aircraft and once suffered a galling experience when the DFW C.V reconnaissance he was attacking holed his engine while his guns jammed.

5|$|In 1901 the keeper's {{quarters}} {{went through}} <b>major</b> <b>repairs,</b> replacing the original slate tiles with terracotta ones. This was followed with {{the replacement of}} the steps handrail in 1903. A 1903 report criticised the light, saying that the red flashes were only visible for half the distance of the white ones, confusing navigators. This led to a recommendation to remove the red shades, resulting in a new characteristic of one white flash every minute, and later to upgrade the light to a quick group flashing dioptric light. Another report in 1912 stated that the station was in good condition, but criticised the low power of the light, and recommended withdrawing two of the keepers. However, all of these recommendations were not acted upon until 1 July 1922, when the apparatus was upgraded to a revolving Dalén light with an intensity of 20,000cd, and the manning reduced to two keepers. In 1932 the original gallery handrails, also supplied by H Wilkins & Co., were replaced with steel gas pipe and mild steel rods.|$|E
5|$|By 1983, {{concerns}} {{with the leadership}} of the Battleship Texas Commission led to the decision by the State Legislature to turn over control of the ship to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD). The legislature abolished the commission effective 31 August 1983, and TPWD assumed operational control the next day. One of the first actions by TPWD was to hire a firm of naval architects to survey the ship in order to assess the deterioration and make recommendations as to what actions should be taken to preserve the ship. The survey revealed that the ship's watertight integrity was badly compromised, the hull was open to the sea in many places, and many compartments were full of standing rain water. The architects determined that the ship needed to go to dry dock for <b>major</b> <b>repairs</b> to the hull and to keep rain water from coming through the porous concrete deck. As part of this plan, serious consideration was given to protecting sensitive fabrics and restoring the interior of the ship. After a five-year-long fund-raising campaign, $15 million was collected to dry dock the ship and complete necessary repairs.|$|E
5|$|Königsberg {{required}} <b>major</b> <b>repairs</b> {{before she}} would be able to return to Germany, so she was temporarily moored in the harbor with her broadside facing the harbor entrance. This would allow her to bring all of her main battery guns to bear against any British naval attack. The rest of Gruppe 3 returned to Germany. On the evening of 9 April, she was attacked by British bombers, but to no effect. The following morning, the British launched another air raid on the ship. The raid consisted of sixteen Blackburn Skua dive bombers of the British Fleet Air Arm (seven of 800 Naval Air Squadron and nine of 803 Naval Air Squadron), launched from RNAS Hatston, Orkney. Königsbergs thin deck armor rendered her quite vulnerable to dive bomber attack. The Skuas attacked in three groups: the nine of 803 NAS, six of 800 NAS, and one aircraft of 800 NAS which lost contact during the outward flight but found Königsberg independently. The dive bombers attacked at 7:20, catching the ship's crew off guard. Half of the dive bombers had completed their dives before the crew realized they were under attack. Only one large anti-aircraft gun was reported as being manned with shells being fired once every five seconds from the aft of the ship with lighter anti-air weapons firing from the shore and adjacent ships firing even later in the attack.|$|E

5|$|On 27 September 1965, Minister for Air Peter Howson {{announced}} that No.37 Squadron {{was to be}} re-raised to operate twelve Lockheed C-130E Hercules transport aircraft that had been purchased by the Federal government; the new aircraft would allow the RAAF to support Australian deployments in South East Asia while continuing to meet its domestic commitments. The squadron was formed at RAAF Base Richmond on 21February 1966, {{under the command of}} Wing Commander Ron McKimm. It joined No.36 Squadron, which had been operating C-130A Hercules since 1958. No.486 Squadron, disbanded in 1964, was re-formed at Richmond to provide maintenance for both Hercules squadrons; <b>major</b> <b>repairs</b> and upgrades to the C-130s were the responsibility of No.2 Aircraft Depot (later No.503 Wing). As the C-130E had a longer range and could carry a greater payload than the C-130A, No.37 Squadron was generally assigned strategic tasks, while No.36 Squadron's responsibilities were primarily tactical in nature. No.37 Squadron began taking delivery of its C-130Es in August, {{and by the end of}} September its staff numbered eighty-six, including twenty-one officers. In February 1967, the squadron commenced long-range missions in support of Australian forces in the Vietnam War, including aero-medical evacuations conveying wounded soldiers back to Australia, generally via RAAF Base Butterworth, Malaysia. Initially both C-130A and Emodels were employed for such evacuations, but only C-130Es were assigned to this task from May 1967, as they offered more comfortable conditions and were capable of flying directly between South Vietnam and Australia if required. By the end of February 1968, No.37 Squadron had a strength of 207 personnel: eighty-five aircrew, including fifty-one officers, and 122 ground staff, including three officers. The squadron transported the last Australian forces out of Vietnam in December 1972, following the Federal government's decision to withdraw from the conflict.|$|E
