5|$|The vast <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> of {{hyperparathyroidism}} are {{the result}} of the random formation of benign, but metabolically active, parathyroid adenoma swellings. These instances comprise approximately 80–85% of all documented cases of hyperparathyroidism.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{is based}} on the {{severity}} of poisoning from the bite; the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> do not require medical care, and patients with localised pain, swelling and redness usually only require local application of ice and simple oral analgesia such as paracetamol. Pressure immobilisation of the wound site is not recommended. Keeping the victim still and calm is beneficial.|$|E

5|$|Brachytherapy for {{prostate}} cancer may cause erectile dysfunction in approximately 15-30% of patients. However, the risk of erectile dysfunction is related to age (older men are at a greater risk than younger men) and also the level of erectile function prior to receiving brachytherapy. In patients who do experience erectile dysfunction, the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> can successfully be treated with drugs such as Viagra. Importantly, the risk of erectile dysfunction after brachytherapy is less than after radical prostatectomy.|$|E
5|$|Eighty-nine {{per cent}} of courts martial {{returned}} a guilty verdict, the vast <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> being for offences such as Absence Without Leave (the most common offence), drunkenness and insubordination. Terms of imprisonment were often suspended, to discourage soldiers from {{committing an offence}} to escape the front lines, but also to give a convicted man a chance to earn a reprieve for good conduct.|$|E

5|$|Genetics is {{believed}} {{to be involved in the}} <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> either directly or indirectly. Some epilepsies are due to a single gene defect (1–2%); most are due to the interaction of multiple genes and environmental factors. Each of the single gene defects is rare, with more than 200 in all described. Most genes involved affect ion channels, either directly or indirectly. These include genes for ion channels themselves, enzymes, GABA, and G protein-coupled receptors.|$|E
5|$|Progression from TB {{infection}} to overt TB disease {{occurs when}} the bacilli overcome the immune system defenses and begin to multiply. In primary TB disease (some 1–5% of cases), this occurs soon after the initial infection. However, in the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> a latent infection occurs with no obvious symptoms. These dormant bacilli produce active tuberculosis in 5–10% of these latent cases, often many years after infection.|$|E
5|$|Since most {{toothache}} is {{the result}} of plaque-related diseases, such as tooth decay and periodontal disease, the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> could be prevented by avoidance of a cariogenic diet and maintenance of good oral hygiene. That is, reduction in the number times that refined sugars are consumed per day and brushing the teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste and flossing. Regular visits to a dentist also increases the likelihood that problems are detected early and averted before toothache occurs. Dental trauma could also be significantly reduced by routine use of mouthguards in contact sports.|$|E

5|$|The exact {{cause of}} Tourette's is unknown, {{but it is}} well {{established}} that both genetic and environmental factors are involved. Genetic epidemiology {{studies have shown that}} the overwhelming <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> of Tourette's are inherited, although the exact mode of inheritance is not yet known and no gene has been identified. In other cases, tics are associated with disorders other than Tourette's, a phenomenon known as tourettism.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{specific}} medical or screening tests {{that can be}} used in diagnosing Tourette's; it is frequently misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed, partly because of the wide expression of severity, ranging from mild (the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases)</b> or moderate, to severe (the rare, but more widely recognized and publicized cases). Coughing, eye blinking, and tics that mimic unrelated conditions such as asthma are commonly misdiagnosed.|$|E
5|$|These ulcers occur {{periodically}} {{and heal}} completely between attacks. In the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> the individual ulcers last about 7–10 days, and ulceration episodes occur 3–6 times per year. Most {{appear on the}} non-keratinizing epithelial surfaces in the mouth (i.e. anywhere except the attached gingiva, the hard palate and the dorsum of the tongue), although the more severe forms, which are less common, may also involve keratinizing epithelial surfaces. Symptoms range from a minor nuisance to interfering with eating and drinking. The severe forms may be debilitating, even causing weight loss due to malnutrition.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being the}} most {{commonly}} studied and diagnosed mental disorder in children and adolescents, the exact cause is unknown in the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases.</b> It affects about 5–7% of children when diagnosed via the DSM-IV criteria and 1–2% when diagnosed via the ICD-10 criteria. As of 2015 it is estimated to affect about 51.1 million people. Rates are similar between countries and depend mostly on how it is diagnosed. ADHD is diagnosed approximately three times more often in boys than in girls, although the disorder is often overlooked in girls due to their symptoms differing from those of boys. About 30–50% of people diagnosed in childhood continue to have symptoms into adulthood and between 2–5% of adults have the condition.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} serious {{poisoning}} the mushroom causes delirium, somewhat similar in effect to anticholinergic poisoning (such as that caused by Datura stramonium), characterised by bouts of marked agitation with confusion, hallucinations, and irritability followed by periods of {{central nervous system}} depression. Seizures and coma may also occur in severe poisonings. Symptoms typically appear after around 30 to 90 minutes and peak within three hours, but certain effects can last for several days. In the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> recovery is complete within 12 to 24hours. The effect is highly variable between individuals, with similar doses potentially causing quite different reactions. Some people suffering intoxication have exhibited headaches up to ten hours afterwards. Retrograde amnesia and somnolence can result following recovery.|$|E
5|$|Ordinary {{smallpox}} generally {{produced a}} discrete rash, {{in which the}} pustules stood out on the skin separately. The distribution of the rash was densest on the face; denser on the extremities than on the trunk; and on the extremities, denser on the distal parts than on the proximal. The palms of the hands and soles of the feet {{were involved in the}} <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases.</b> Sometimes, the blisters merged into sheets, forming a confluent rash, which began to detach the outer layers of skin from the underlying flesh. Patients with confluent smallpox often remained ill even after scabs have formed over all the lesions. In one case series, the case-fatality rate in confluent smallpox was 62 percent.|$|E

The institutions are intended to be mixed sex. Playschools are intended for {{children under the age}} of six; the youngest children to attend are at least two years old. Children of single parents and students are given priority, and in some cases children with a handicap are also given priority. In the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> the children are divided into age groups, but in some smaller communities these may be grouped together.|$|E
5|$|The <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> of cholangiocarcinoma {{present as}} {{inoperable}} (unresectable) disease {{in which case}} patients are generally treated with palliative chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy. Chemotherapy {{has been shown in}} a randomized controlled trial to improve quality of life and extend survival in patients with inoperable cholangiocarcinoma. There is no single chemotherapy regimen which is universally used, and enrollment in clinical trials is often recommended when possible. Chemotherapy agents used to treat cholangiocarcinoma include 5-fluorouracil with leucovorin, gemcitabine as a single agent, or gemcitabine plus cisplatin, irinotecan, or capecitabine. A small pilot study suggested possible benefit from the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib in patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Damage and {{subsequent}} dysfunction in mitochondria {{is an important}} factor in a range of human diseases due to their influence in cell metabolism. Mitochondrial disorders often present themselves as neurological disorders, including autism. They can also manifest as myopathy, diabetes, multiple endocrinopathy, and a variety of other systemic disorders. Diseases caused by mutation in the mtDNA include Kearns-Sayre syndrome, MELAS syndrome and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. In the vast <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> these diseases are transmitted by a female to her children, as the zygote derives its mitochondria and hence its mtDNA from the ovum. Diseases such as Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Pearson syndrome, and progressive external ophthalmoplegia are thought to be due to large-scale mtDNA rearrangements, whereas other diseases such as MELAS syndrome, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF), and others are due to point mutations in mtDNA.|$|E
