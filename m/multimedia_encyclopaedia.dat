Encarta was the top-selling <b>multimedia</b> <b>encyclopaedia,</b> based on total US retail sales from January 2000 to February 2006. Both occupied {{the same price}} range, with the 2007 Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate CD or DVD costing US$40–50 and the Microsoft Encarta Premium 2007 DVD costing US$45. The Britannica contains 100,000 articles and Merriam-Webster's Dictionary and Thesaurus (US only), and offers Primary and Secondary School editions. Encarta contained 66,000 articles, a user-friendly Visual Browser, interactive maps, math, language and homework tools, a US and UK dictionary, and a youth edition. Like Encarta, the Britannica has been criticised for being biased towards United States audiences; the United Kingdom-related articles are updated less often, maps of the United States are more detailed than those of other countries, and it lacks a UK dictionary. Like the Britannica, Encarta was available online by subscription, although some content could be accessed free.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} the result of {{interviews}} with teachers, students, and school librarians in eight UK secondary schools regarding their use of <b>multimedia</b> <b>encyclopaedias</b> on CD-ROM. It focuses on a content analysis of their comments on how having access to <b>multimedia</b> <b>encyclopaedias</b> changes the way students work and learn in school, how they perceive it enhances their learning, and how it hinders it. Teachers reported that they used <b>multimedia</b> <b>encyclopaedias</b> as an additional information resource, or because their use was motivating to the students. Some said that having <b>multimedia</b> <b>encyclopaedias</b> had no effect on their teaching. However, they were not so much using multimedia resources within their teaching, but sending students out of their lessons to the library to use them. The most important factor, by far, in the students' motivation to use <b>multimedia</b> <b>encyclopaedias</b> in school was that they found them quick and easy to use. There was also strong support for motivation through the graphics, video, and sound on the CD-ROM. There was some support for the students being motivated because they were allowed to be in control of their learning. To {{make the most of the}} potential of <b>multimedia</b> <b>encyclopaedias</b> for enhancing students' learning in schools, it is recommended that a large and early emphasis needs to be placed on the teaching of information handling and research skills. Students pre- pared in this way will be better equipped to enjoy the more open, independent learning tasks to which <b>multimedia</b> <b>encyclopaedias</b> so readily lend themselves...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: East-Christian icon art is {{recognised}} {{as one of}} {{the most}} significant areas of the art of painting. Regrettably, it is still being neglected in the digital documentation and the registry of the art of painting. The accessibility to that large part of mankind's cultural and historical ancestry would be enhanced greatly if icons of all possible kinds and origins were digitised, classified, and „exhibited “ in the Internet. That would allow the preservation and even the future digital restoration of a large number of rare specimens of the East-Christian art of painting. This article aims to introduce how modern techniques from the area of digital libraries can be used for implementing the demonstrative <b>multimedia</b> library “Virtual <b>encyclopaedia</b> of the Bulgarian iconography ” 4, containing a large number of Bulgarian iconic art masterpieces and iconography of various authors, periods and schools...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{a study of the}} {{information}} retrieval strategies of secondary school children using Microsoft® Encarta™, <b>multimedia</b> <b>encyclopaedia.</b> Data were collected by systematic observation and interviewing procedures. Analysis of the data revealed that the children predominantly used the alphabetic index to find the required information. Keyword searching was rarely used and search tactics were in general unplanned, with browsing being a common tactic. The children themselves reported they were unaware of the existence of searching strategies other than using the Index. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for teaching and learning. Περίληψ...|$|E
