Aircraft selected to fly these missions must meet the highest standards of reliability and must not have an uncorrected history of repeat or recurring malfunctions. Missions are extensively coordinated and any delay has serious effect on mission support. PHOENIX BANNER, PHOENIX SILVER, and PHOENIX COPPER missions are of high level interest and must get special attention in accordance with established CLOSE WATCH procedures. Any problems that affect the mission will be immediately {{brought to the attention of}} the 618th Air and Space Operations Center (Tanker Airlift Control Center) for AMC controlled assets or the theater Air Mobility Operations Control Center (AMOCC) in a theater Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) for theater controlled assets.|$|E

40|$|Air {{transport}} has {{a considerable}} impact on tourism, trade {{and other aspects}} of society, and the industry that constructs and <b>maintains</b> <b>aircraft</b> is a major employer and wealth generator. Many nations have made substantial investments aimed at developing and retaining world- class aerospace design and manufacturing capabilities; if these resources are to be deployed to best effect, the aerospace industry needs a means of understanding, describing and analysing the future business environment, in order to formulate strategies that minimise risks. To address this need, the VIVACE (Value Improvement through a Virtual Aeronautical Collaborative Enterprise) programme, funded under the European Unionâ€™s 6 th Framework scheme, includes a work package that addresses business case modelling for the extended enterprise. The partnership for this task includes the University of Nottingham, Rolls-Royce and Volvo Aero Corporation. Based upon research conducted within the partnership, and taking into account supplier and customer needs at various stages in the supply network and the after-market sector, this paper presents a methodology to support and promote strategic thinking in the aerospace business environment, from a broad range of perspectives. ...|$|E
