By adding/subtracting u multiples of the first cup and v multiples of the second cup, any volume ua + vb can be <b>measured</b> <b>out.</b> These volumes are all multiples of g = gcd(a, b).|$|E
5|$|Another {{change in}} the 1370s was the {{formalisation}} {{of the process of}} guarding and maintaining the walls. During the invasion scare of 1377, Edward instructed the mayor to review these processes; it appears that the four wards of the town were surveyed, and each property was assigned a piece of the wall to maintain, varying according {{to the size of the}} property. For these purposes, the walls were <b>measured</b> <b>out</b> in units called loupes, or embrasures. The four wards were also responsible for the security and policing of the town.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, MGM hired Hilliard {{away from}} UA. His first {{assignment}} was to fix their problematic recording amplifiers whose overall phase shift <b>measured</b> <b>out</b> to a voice-distorting 1500 degrees. Hilliard's {{solution was to}} use higher linearity transformers obtained from Lansing Manufacturing Company, in consultation with founder Jim Lansing. Earlier, Hilliard had befriended a laboratory associate of his wife's, Dr. John Blackburn, and in 1934, he helped Blackburn get a position as design engineer at Lansing Manufacturing. The following year, Hilliard and his team at MGM solved the problem of recording Nelson Eddy's strong operatic baritone alongside Jeanette MacDonald's flat and weak soprano voice, picking up an Academy Award for Sound Recording on the duo's first film together: Naughty Marietta.|$|E

Carmack <b>measured</b> <b>out</b> four claims, strips of ground that could later be legally mined by the owner, along the river; these {{including}} two for himself—one as his normal claim, the second {{as a reward for}} having discovered the gold—and one each for Jim and Charlie. The claims were registered next day at the police post {{at the mouth of the}} Fortymile River and news spread rapidly from there to other mining camps in the Yukon River valley.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Miller {{headed to}} Lord's {{to play for}} the RAAF against the South of England. Chasing 208, Miller scored an unbeaten 78 in 95 minutes, but rain washed out the match. In the first innings of Third Victory Test at Lord's, when finally called upon to bowl, Miller <b>measured</b> <b>out</b> a run-up and removed John Dewes, Donald Carr and Hutton, all bowled. He ended with 3/44. Miller was rewarded with the new ball in the second innings. He removed Dewes, Edrich and Dick Pollard to end with 3/42. This left Australia a target of 225. Miller saw Australia to the target, unbeaten on 71. In the Fourth Test, again at Lord's, Miller scored 118 in the first innings, before an unbeaten 25 in the second innings ensured a draw. The {{tremendous}} public reception of the Victory Tests resulted in a fifth match being added to the schedule.|$|E
25|$|This {{system is}} {{constructed}} {{in a similar}} manner as the Equal house, but houses are <b>measured</b> <b>out</b> in 30 degree increments starting from the longitude of the midheaven, which acts as the 'cusp' or starting point of the 10th house.

For example, such a bearing might be listed as [...] "N 42°35' W", {{which means that the}} bearing is 42°35' counterclockwise, or west of north.|$|R

By adding the various measures of powder a desired charge can be <b>measured</b> <b>out</b> with a safe degree of accuracy. However, since multiple measures of powder are often needed, and since powder lots may vary slightly in density, a scale accurate to 1/10-grain (6.5mg) is desirable.|$|E
25|$|Gold {{and silver}} markets evolved in {{classical}} civilizations. At first the precious metals were valued for their beauty and intrinsic worth and {{were associated with}} royalty. In time, they were used for trading and were exchanged for other goods and commodities, or for payments of labor. Gold, <b>measured</b> <b>out,</b> then became money. Gold's scarcity, its unique density {{and the way it}} could be easily melted, shaped, and measured made it a natural trading asset.|$|E
500|$|The gold solidi are all {{close to}} their {{theoretical}} weight of 4.48g ( [...] of a Roman pound). The fineness of a solidus in this period was 99% gold. The total weight of the solidi in the hoard is almost exactly 8 Roman pounds, suggesting that the coins had been <b>measured</b> <b>out</b> by weight rather than number. Analysis of the siliquae suggests a range of fineness of between 95% and 99% silver, with {{the highest percentage of}} silver found just after a reform of the coinage in 368. Of the siliquae, 428 are locally produced imitations, generally of high quality and with as much silver as the official siliquae of the period. However, a handful are cliché forgeries where a core of base metal has been wrapped in silver foil.|$|E

500|$|The next day, Miller {{headed to}} Lord's {{to play for}} the RAAF against the South of England. Chasing 208, Miller scored an unbeaten 78 in 95 minutes. The Australians were 3/184, well placed to reach the target of 208 when rain washed out the match. He then scored 30 and took 1/14 as the RAAF {{defeated}} the Army. In the Third Victory Test at Lord's, despite his efforts in the previous Victory Test, Miller was only Hassett's sixth-choice bowler, coming on when England were 2/100. This time he <b>measured</b> <b>out</b> a run up. Miller struck John Dewes before uprooting his off stump. He then bowled Donald Carr for four and then removed Hutton's off stump. He ended with 3/44 from 18 overs. Miller was bowled for seven in the first innings but was rewarded with the new ball in the second innings. He bowled Dewes for a duck with an outswinger, before bowling Edrich and Pollard to end with 3/42. This left Australia a target of 225 in five hours. Miller came into bat at 3/104 and saw Australia to the target unbeaten on 71. C B Fry opined that Miller's innings was [...] "superbly stroked and directed cover driving of the pace bowling formed the most telling and majestic feature".|$|E
