Along with Barry Evans as their teacher, Ali {{was one of a}} lively group of foreigners in an English as a Foreign Language class at a London night-school. Ali was a Muslim Pakistani who had immigrated to the United Kingdom, and was frequently seen bickering with Ranjeet Singh (Albert Moses), a Sikh from India. Ali called Ranjeet names like “poppadum”, frequently calls him a “damn fool” and tells him that he will “kick him up the Khyber” ("Khyber Pass" [...] being rhyming slang for [...] "arse"). This antagonistic relationship is depicted regularly throughout the early episodes, with the characters frequently having verbal and occasionally physical arguments but as the series progresses, their relationship mellows into one of friendly and <b>mutual</b> <b>supportiveness.</b>|$|E
50|$|Van Gogh {{moved from}} Paris to Arles {{in hopes of}} {{creating}} a community for artists to exist in <b>mutual</b> <b>supportiveness</b> and encouragement. He invited Paul Gauguin, an artist whom he had befriended in Paris, to come stay with him. They {{proved to be a}} disagreeable pair and quarreled often, sometimes violently. The evening of December 23, 1888 during one of their arguments, Van Gogh had a seizure during which he threatened Gauguin with a razor, but then injured himself, severing part of his left ear. In a state of excitement, he then brought the dismembered lobe to the Maison de Tolérance bordello where he presented it to a prostitute named Rachel. When Gauguin returned the following morning he discovered that the police had arrived at the house, and blood was splattered in every room. Van Gogh had severed an artery in his neck, and was in grave health after losing so much blood. He was removed to the hospital, and he confessed to having no recollection of what happened during this fit. Throughout his life, Van Gogh continued to suffer from similar fits, sometimes characterized by acute paranoia.|$|E
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{principle}} of <b>mutual</b> <b>supportiveness</b> as a key legal tool to address tensions between competing regimes, with specific reference to the articulation of the WTO system with other subject areas protecting essential interests of the international community, such as in particular the right to health, cultural diversity, and environmental protection. It argues that the multiple references to <b>mutual</b> <b>supportiveness</b> found in recent treaties and other legal instruments should not be briskly dismissed as mere political statements devoid of any normative significance. On the contrary, while such reiterated references are important in terms of progressive consolidation of a general principle of international law, <b>mutual</b> <b>supportiveness</b> seems to be characterized by two remarkable legal dimensions. The first is its interpretative dimension, which serves the purpose of disqualifying solutions to tensions between competing regimes involving the application of conflict rules. The second is the law-making dimension of <b>mutual</b> <b>supportiveness</b> which comes into play when efforts at reconciling competing rules have unsuccessfully been exhausted. This dimension implies a duty to pursue good faith negotiations aimed at the conclusion of law-making instruments, including treaty amendments, which clarify the relationship between the competing regimes at hand. This duty is especially important for the ongoing WTO Doha negotiations which call into question non-trade regimes and values, for instance the fair and equitable use of biological resources under the 1992 Biodiversity Convention. Most importantly, either for its nature as a general principle or for its recognition as a standard internal to the WTO, <b>mutual</b> <b>supportiveness</b> under the guise of a duty to negotiate in good faith would also bind WTO Members which are not parties to the competing treaty regime which needs accommodation in WTO law...|$|E

40|$|The WTO Secretariat {{describes}} {{sustainable development}} as a central WTO principle. Relevant international law treaties have declared sustainable development’s <b>mutual</b> <b>supportiveness</b> with trade liberalization, and also emphasized the need to balance its ‘pillars’: economic development, often equated with trade liberalization, with environmental conservation and social welfare. While ‘mutual supportiveness’ suggests that sustainable development’s environmental and social goals are {{a side effect of}} trade liberalization, ‘balancing’ involves weighing these different goals, and prompts the difficult question of which are most important, and who is empowered to decide. This paper traces these two broad theoretical conceptions through WTO legal texts, negotiations and dispute settlement, arguing that they have important pragmatic implications. In particular, to create <b>mutual</b> <b>supportiveness</b> WTO Director-General, Pascal Lamy, has stated the need for adequate domestic policies, suggesting that the WTO should support these. Yet, if they have negative trade impacts, pure ‘sustainable development’ policies may be difficult to balance against the WTO obligation to liberalize trade...|$|E

40|$|With an ever {{increasing}} number of international agreements addressing {{a wide range of}} issues, clashes between such agreements and international courts have become more likely if not avoidable. Whether it concerns the relation of labour law and competitiveness, climate change mitigation and tariffs on environmental goods and services, the protection of the sea and maritime transportation, or biodiversity conservation and the green economy - trade law and with it the WTO touches upon a myriad of areas regulated by international agreements other than the WTO. Professor Pieter Jan Kuijper from Amsterdam University explores this relation in his recent study "Conflicting Rules and Clashing Courts: The Case of Environmental Agreements, Free Trade Agreements and the WTO" published by the International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development (ICTSD). In this paper, the tool kit available under international law to solve such disputes is discussed through a large number of references to exiting or potential cases. Professor Kuijper concludes his paper with a list of concrete recommendations to negotiators, litigators, courts and countries. Amongst others, he proposes increased attention on the principle of <b>mutual</b> <b>supportiveness</b> - an wording found in an {{increasing number of}} environmental agreements. Moreover, he makes some concrete observations on so called "fork-in-the-road provisions" in free trade agreements and develops recommendations for the inter-regime coordination of international tribunals and the application of comity or litispendence in international courts: "The application of WTO law may require that the interpretative principle of <b>mutual</b> <b>supportiveness</b> is applied to the relevant WTO rules, which does not imply non-application of WTO law, but application in a restrained way that would not harm the object and purpose of the WTO Agreements. " "In the interest of the stability of international rule making and governance, international courts and tribunals in neighboring fields, like trade, investment, the environment etc. need to develop a doctrine of "forum non conveniens" between themselves, {{or at the very least}} use their inherent powers to abstain from exercising jurisdiction or rule on admissibility if there are serious reasons to do so. ...|$|E
40|$|The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) {{recognized}} that sustainable development {{can only be}} actualized if environmental norms are integrated into other areas of policy across levels of governance. This article examines the Committee on Trade and Environment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) {{to answer the question}} of why actors' efforts to enhance the <b>mutual</b> <b>supportiveness</b> of trade and environmental norms have resulted in minimalist policy outcomes. I first introduce a framework for analyzing norms and their levels of compatibility and a social learning explanation for policy integration emphasizing the importance of normative and institutional conditions. Second, I show that low levels of both norm compatibility between UNCED and WTO and institutional capacity in the WTO for learning have contributed to weak integration. The approach contributes to constructivist theory development and the findings provide insights to policy-makers grappling with how to support the integration of norms and institutions in global governance.

40|$|This {{writing has}} the purpose to shed {{a light on}} the {{relationship}} between the 2005 Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expression and the 1972 Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (World Heritage Convention), {{in light of the fact}} that certain cultural properties may be of significance under both these legal instruments. In particular, it is examined, on the one hand, how the two conventions in point can be integrated with each other for ensuring better protection to cultural heritage (intended in its widest sense), and, on the other hand, how the potential conflicts between them may be settled. To this purpose, after providing a general assessment of the evolution of international law on cultural heritage and a summary review of the system set up by the World Heritage Convention, this writing is concentrated on the possible aspects of (positive and negative) interaction between the two conventions, with particular attention to their <b>mutual</b> <b>supportiveness</b> in interpretation, to their complementarity as well as, finally, to the latent aspects of conflict between them...|$|E
40|$|Recent European Union {{sustainability}} {{criteria for}} biofuels {{provide an opportunity}} to understand more precisely the relationship between national sustainable development policies and World Trade Organization (WTO) law. A desire to avoid WTO conflict was one reason for the omission of stronger criteria addressing negative social and environmental impacts of increased biofuels production. Thus, despite declarations of sustainable development’s central importance in WTO legal texts and statements by the Secretariat, national sustainability regulations risked trade law conflict. This article documents potential reasons for a WTO regulatory chill effect on the sustainability criteria. It then outlines challenges that the regulatory concept poses to trade law, which result primarily from its breadth and complexity, as well as the lack of targeted international standards, and its emphasis on production processes which intrude heavily, in an extraterritorial sense, on importers. It is important to identify these limitations to the <b>mutual</b> <b>supportiveness</b> between trade liberalization and national policies to achieve sustainability goals. However, despite these limitations, the case study also suggests that, with regard to sustainability criteria, sustainable development’s soft power as a WTO legal principle is an important source of influence...|$|E
40|$|While {{there is}} a broad {{empirical}} literature {{on the impact of}} trade on environment, the literature on the impact of environmental regulations on trade flows is relatively scarce, very heterogeneous and presents mixed results. The innovative feature of this paper is its attempt to estimate, in a gravity setting, the overall impact on 14 EU countries’ bilateral exports of three major Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs). According to the estimates arrived at in this paper, membership of MEAs in 1988 - 2008 had a positive impact on EU 14 exports ranging between 22 and 35 %. Furthermore, it seems that joint membership of WTO/EU and MEAs had a further positive ‘interaction effect’ on EU 15 exports. These results show the presence of a synergy, at least for EU members, between environmental regulations and trade flows. It can be partly explained by a possible trade diversion effect with respect to countries that did not sign an MEA, and a corresponding trade-creation effect among members of the environmental agreements. This explanation seems consistent {{with the fact that the}} relevance of the relationship between MEAs, EU and WTO rules for enhancing <b>mutual</b> <b>supportiveness</b> of environment and trade has been clearly reflected in the international negotiations over the past 20 years...|$|E

Soap operas watched by millions play with every lurid permutation of relationships in fictional neighbourhoods. One is even called Neighbours. Disputes over gigantic Leylandii and noise nuisance turn nasty and fill newspaper columns. These stories have a rich history - as long as men have lived in shelters, they have had neighbours. In this fascinating social history, Emily Cockayne traces {{the story of the}} British neighbour through nine centuries -spanning Medieval, Tudor and Victorian periods,,two world wars and up to today's modern, virtual world. Cheek by Jowl brilliantly reveals how neighbour relations have changed over time and maps the complex emotional, sexual and economic threads of association between neighbours. As people lived more densely together, and lifestyles diversified, the potential for neighbour nuisance and jealousy grew. In contrast, where communities of people emerged who shared an employer or an economic predicament, solidarity and <b>mutual</b> <b>supportiveness</b> would ease the hardships of life. Cheek by Jowl will also examine {{the way we think about}} architecture and our living spaces. It treats houses as vessels for living that enable or frustrate us from fulfilling our human potential rather than as aesthetic objects. With humour, wit and fascinating historical anecdotes this is social history at its most colourful and interesting.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{brings into}} sharper focus {{the crisis of}} care in our society which underlies {{the politics of the}} welfare state. It explores points of vulnerability in the liberal, professional-bureaucratic approach to care which the New Right has been able to exploit in undermining support for much needed public sector human services. It argues that we need to move beyond conservative, liberal, and orthodox Marxist approaches to care, in favor of a socialist-feminist, communitarian approach which recognizes the need for mutual support in dealing with our common human vulnerability. This approach makes the super-exploitation and devaluation of women 2 ̆ 7 s caring capacities, within home and state, and the underdevelopment of men 2 ̆ 7 s capacity to care, a central issue. The void of <b>mutual</b> <b>supportiveness,</b> combined with prolonged economic insecurity and social disorientation, has given rise to a level of personal anxiety and pain that has reached crisis proportions, outstripping the professional-managerial capacity of the liberal welfare state to contain, and increasing the power of the right. Human service practitioners are caught in a severe bind as they attempt to fill this support void, while being bound by a set of professional-hierarchical and fiscal constraints not of their own making. The thesis concludes with a vision of service in which the professional-hierarchical and gender defined social relations of care are transformed to enhance our capacity to care for one another as an ongoing, mutually shared part of our life activity. It points to the black and white working class women, who are the main providers and recipients of state human services, as an important and underacknowledged source of insight and leadership in undertaking these changes upon which our social survival and growth depends. ...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} much {{controversy}} over the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) – a plurilateral trade agreement involving a dozen nations from throughout the Pacific Rim – and its impact upon the environment, biodiversity, and climate change. The secretive treaty negotiations involve Australia and New Zealand; countries from South East Asia such as Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, and Japan; the South American nations of Peru and Chile; {{and the members of}} the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Canada, Mexico and the United States. There was an agreement reached between the parties in October 2015. The participants asserted: ‘We expect this historic agreement to promote economic growth, support higher-paying jobs; enhance innovation, productivity and competitiveness; raise living standards; reduce poverty in our countries; and to promote transparency, good governance, and strong labor and environmental protections. ’ The final texts of the agreement were published in November 2015. There has been discussion as to whether other countries – such as Indonesia, the Philippines, and South Korea – will join the deal. There {{has been much}} debate about the impact of this proposed treaty upon intellectual property, the environment, biodiversity and climate change. There have been similar concerns about the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) – a proposed trade agreement between the United States and the European Union. In 2011, the United States Trade Representative developed a Green Paper on trade, conservation, and the environment in the context of the TPP. In its rhetoric, the United States Trade Representative has maintained that it has been pushing for strong, enforceable environmental standards in the TPP. In a key statement in 2014, the United States Trade Representative Mike Froman insisted: ‘The United States’ position on the environment in the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations is this: environmental stewardship is a core American value, and we will insist on a robust, fully enforceable environment chapter in the TPP or we will not come to agreement. ’ The United States Trade Representative maintained: ‘Our proposals in the TPP are centered around the enforcement of environmental laws, including those implementing multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) in TPP partner countries, and also around trailblazing, first-ever conservation proposals that will raise standards across the region’. Moreover, the United States Trade Representative asserted: ‘Furthermore, our proposals would enhance international cooperation and create new opportunities for public participation in environmental governance and enforcement. ’ The United States Trade Representative has provided this public outline of the Environment Chapter of the TPP: A meaningful outcome on environment will ensure that the agreement appropriately addresses important trade and environment challenges and enhances the <b>mutual</b> <b>supportiveness</b> of trade and environment. The Trans-Pacific Partnership countries share the view that the environment text should include effective provisions on trade-related issues that would help to reinforce environmental protection and are discussing an effective institutional arrangement to oversee implementation and a specific cooperation framework for addressing capacity building needs. They also are discussing proposals on new issues, such as marine fisheries and other conservation issues, biodiversity, invasive alien species, climate change, and environmental goods and services. Mark Linscott, an assistant Trade Representative testified: ‘An environment chapter in the TPP should strengthen country commitments to enforce their environmental laws and regulations, including in areas related to ocean and fisheries governance, through the effective enforcement obligation subject to dispute settlement. ’ Inside US Trade has commented: ‘While not initially expected to be among the most difficult areas, the environment chapter has emerged as a formidable challenge, partly due to disagreement over the United States proposal to make environmental obligations binding under the TPP dispute settlement mechanism’. Joshua Meltzer from the Brookings Institute contended that the trade agreement could be a boon for the protection of the environment in the Pacific Rim: Whether it is depleting fisheries, declining biodiversity or reduced space in the atmosphere for Greenhouse Gas emissions, the underlying issue is resource scarcity. And in a world where an additional 3 billion people are expected to enter the middle class over the next 15 years, countries need to find new and creative ways to cooperate in order to satisfy the legitimate needs of their population for growth and opportunity while using resources in a manner that is sustainable for current and future generations. The TPP parties already represent a diverse range of developed and developing countries. Should the TPP become a free trade agreement of the Asia-Pacific region, it will include the main developed and developing countries and will be a strong basis for building a global consensus on these trade and environmental issues. The TPP has been promoted by its proponents as a boon to the environment. The United States Trade Representative has maintained that the TPP will protect the environment: ‘The United States’ position on the environment in the TPP negotiations is this: environmental stewardship is a core American value, and we will insist on a robust, fully enforceable environment chapter in the TPP or we will not come to agreement. ’ The United States Trade Representative discussed ‘Trade for a Greener World’ on World Environment Day. Andrew Robb, at the time the Australian Trade and Investment Minister, vowed that the TPP will contain safeguards for the protection of the environment. In November 2015, after the release of the TPP text, Rohan Patel, the Special Assistant to the President and Deputy Director of Intergovernmental Affairs, sought to defend the environmental credentials of the TPP. He contended that the deal had been supported by the Nature Conservancy, the International Fund for Animal Welfare, the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative, the World Wildlife Fund, and World Animal Protection. The United States Congress, though, has been conflicted by the United States Trade Representative’s arguments about the TPP and the environment. In 2012, members of the United States Congress - including Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), Olympia Snowe (R-ME), and John Kerry (D-MA) – wrote a letter, arguing that the trade agreement needs to provide strong protection for the environment: ‘We believe that a ' 21 st century agreement' must have an environment chapter that guarantees ongoing sustainable trade and creates jobs, and this is what American businesses and consumers want and expect also. ’ The group stressed that ‘A binding and enforceable TPP environment chapter that stands up for American interests is critical to our support of the TPP’. The Congressional leaders maintained: ‘We believe the 2007 bipartisan congressional consensus on environmental provisions included in recent trade agreements should serve as the framework for the environment chapter of the TPP. ’ In 2013, senior members of the Democratic leadership expressed their opposition to granting President Barack Obama a fast-track authority in respect of the TPP House of Representatives Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said: ‘No on fast-track – Camp-Baucus – out of the question. ’ Senator Majority leader Harry Reid commented: ‘I’m against Fast-Track: Everyone would be well-advised to push this right now. ’ Senator Elizabeth Warren has been particularly critical of the process and the substance of the negotiations in the TPP: From what I hear, Wall Street, pharmaceuticals, telecom, big polluters and outsourcers are all salivating at the chance to rig the deal in the upcoming trade talks. So the question is, Why are the trade talks secret? You’ll love this answer. Boy, the things you learn on Capitol Hill. I actually have had supporters of the deal say to me ‘They have to be secret, because if the American people knew what was actually in them, they would be opposed. 		Think about that. Real people, people whose jobs are at stake, small-business owners who don’t want to compete with overseas companies that dump their waste in rivers and hire workers for a dollar a day—those people, people without an army of lobbyists—they would be opposed. I believe if people across this country would be opposed to a particular trade agreement, then maybe that trade agreement should not happen. The Finance Committee in the United States Congress deliberated over the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations in 2014. The new chair Ron Wyden has argued that there needs to be greater transparency in trade. Nonetheless, he has mooted the possibility of a ‘smart-track’ to reconcile the competing demands of the Obama Administration, and United States Congress. Wyden insisted: ‘The new breed of trade challenges spawned over the last generation must be addressed in imaginative new policies and locked into enforceable, ambitious, job-generating trade agreements. ’ He emphasized that such agreements ‘must reflect the need for a free and open Internet, strong labor rights and environmental protections. ’ Elder Democrat Sander Levin warned that the TPP failed to provide proper protection for the environment: The TPP parties are considering a different structure to protect the environment than the one adopted in the May 10 Agreement, which directly incorporated seven multilateral environmental agreements into the text of past trade agreements. While the form is less important than the substance, the TPP must provide an overall level of environmental protection that upholds and builds upon the May 10 standard, including fully enforceable obligations. But many of our trading partners are actively seeking to weaken the text to the point of falling short of that standard, including on key issues like conservation. Nonetheless, 2015, President Barack Obama was able to secure the overall support of the United States Congress for his ‘fast-track’ authority. This was made possible by the Republicans and dissident Democrats. Notably, Oregon Senator Ron Wyden switched sides, and was transformed from a critic of the TPP to an apologist for the TPP. For their part, green political parties and civil society organisations have been concerned about the secretive nature of the negotiations; and the substantive implications of the treaty for the environment. Environmental groups and climate advocates have been sceptical of the environmental claims made by the White House for the TPP. The Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand, the Australian Greens and the Green Party of Canada have released a joint declaration on the TPP observing: ‘More than just another trade agreement, the TPP provisions could hinder access to safe, affordable medicines, weaken local content rules for media, stifle high-tech innovation, and even restrict the ability of future governments to legislate for the good of public health and the environment’. In the United States, civil society groups such as the Sierra Club, Public Citizen, WWF, the Friends of the Earth, the Rainforest Action Network and 350. org have raised concerns about the TPP and the environment. Allison Chin, President of the Sierra Club, complained about the lack of transparency, due process, and public participation in the TPP talks: ‘This is a stealth affront to the principles of our democracy. ’ Maude Barlow’s The Council of Canadians has also been concerned about the TPP and environmental justice. New Zealand Sustainability Council executive director Simon Terry said the agreement showed ‘minimal real gains for nature’. A number of organisations have joined a grand coalition of civil society organisations, which are opposed to the grant of a fast-track. On the 15 th January 2013, WikiLeaks released the draft Environment Chapter of the TPP - along with a report by the Chairs of the Environmental Working Group. Julian Assange, WikiLeaks' publisher, stated: ‘Today's WikiLeaks release shows that the public sweetener in the TPP is just media sugar water. ’ He observed: ‘The fabled TPP environmental chapter turns out to be a toothless public relations exercise with no enforcement mechanism. ’ This article provides a critical examination of the draft Environment Chapter of the TPP. The overall argument of the article is that the Environment Chapter of the TPP is an exercise in greenwashing – it is a public relations exercise by the United States Trade Representative, rather than a substantive regime for the protection of the environment in the Pacific Rim. Greenwashing has long been a problem in commerce, in which companies making misleading and deceptive claims about the environment. In his 2012 book, Greenwash: Big Brands and Carbon Scams, Guy Pearse considers the rise of green marketing and greenwashing. Government greenwashing is also a significant issue. In his book Storms of My Grandchildren, the climate scientist James Hansen raises his concerns about government greenwashing. Such a problem is apparent with the TPP – in which there was a gap between the assertions of the United States Government, and the reality of the agreement. This article contends that the TPP fails to meet the expectations created by President Barack Obama, the White House, and the United States Trade Representative about the environmental value of the agreement. First, this piece considers the relationship of the TPP to multilateral environmental treaties. Second, it explores whether the provisions in respect of the environment are enforceable. Third, this article examines the treatment of trade and biodiversity in the TPP. Fourth, this study considers the question of marine capture fisheries. Fifth, there is an evaluation of the cursory text in the TPP on conservation. Sixth, the article considers trade in environmental services under the TPP. Seventh, this article highlights the tensions between the TPP and substantive international climate action. It is submitted that the TPP undermines effective and meaningful government action and regulation in respect of climate change. The conclusion also highlights that a number of other chapters of the TPP will impact upon the protection of the environment – including the Investment Chapter, the Intellectual Property Chapter, the Technical Barriers to Trade Chapter, and the text on public procurement...|$|E
