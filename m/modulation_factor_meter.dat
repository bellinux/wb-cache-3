40|$|Sub-Nyquist {{sampling}} jamming method (SNSJ) is a {{well known}} deception jamming method for inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR). However, the anti-decoy of the SNSJ method performs easier since the amplitude of the false-target images are weaker than the real-target image; the false-target images always lag behind the real-target image, and all targets {{are located in the}} same cross-range. In order to overcome the drawbacks mentioned above, a simple modulation based on SNSJ (M-SNSJ) is presented in this paper. The method first uses amplitude <b>modulation</b> <b>factor</b> to make the amplitude of the false-target images consistent with the real-target image, then uses the down-range <b>modulation</b> <b>factor</b> and cross-range <b>modulation</b> <b>factor</b> to make the false-target images move freely in down-range and cross-range, respectively, thus the capacity of deception is improved.

40|$|I. Introduction Until {{recently}} (up {{to treatment}} planning software version 4. 0. x), the TomoTherapy treatment planning system (TPS) used 51 angles for dose computation. As shown by various quality assurance studies of TomoTherapy treatments, this approximation works {{for most of}} the configurations, especially with usual <b>modulation</b> <b>factors</b> (around 2. 0), small off-axis distances and relatively large tumors. However, treatment plans with small <b>modulation</b> <b>factors</b> display leaves open a larger fraction of the discrete angle. Off-axis positioning breaks the cylindrical symmetry of the system. These two conditions make the hypothesis of a static gantry for each 51 angles less realistic. Accuracy is also likely to be more affected proportionally for a small target. II. Material and methods The effect on accuracy of changing the number of angles was quantified with the following framework: 1. Qualitatively predict the impact of the discretization of gantry rotation for various <b>modulation</b> <b>factors,</b> target sizes, and off-axis positions using a simplified analytical algorithm, which assumes a perfect multileaf collimator and no scatter when photons interact; 2. Analyse difference between dose computation from version 4. 0. x and 4. 1. x of the TPS [Up to version 4. 0. x included, TomoTherapy TPS approximates gantry rotation by computing dose from 51 discrete angles. In versions 4. 1. x and later, TomoTherapy oversamples the projections to better account for gantry rotation (153 discrete angles), but only during full scatter optimization and final calculation (i. e., not during optimization in “beamlet” mode) ]; 3. Perform regular quality assurance using measurements with EDR 2 radiographic films; 4. Isolating the effect of changing the number of discretized angles only (51, 153, and 459) using a previously validated Monte Carlo model (TomoPen 1). The diameters of the targets were 2, 3, and 5 cm; off-axis central positions of target volumes were 5, 10, 15, and 17 cm (when accepted by the treatment unit); planned <b>modulation</b> <b>factors</b> were 1. 3 and 2. 0. These configurations are illustrated on Fig 1. FIG. 1. Schematic diagram (not to scale) of the experimental setup. III. Results · Analytical model predictions The maximum dose deviation equaled 12. 9 % (for a 2 cm target size placed 17 cm offaxis). Deviations larger than 2 % were observed for all off-axis positions simulated with the 2 cm target. For larger targets, deviations higher than 2 % were observed for offaxis distances superior to 10 cm. The analytical algorithm showed also the effect of varying <b>modulation</b> <b>factor,</b> with an additional deviation up to 7 % for low <b>modulation</b> <b>factor</b> compared to results obtained with a high one. · Comparison measurements-TPS Differences were quantified using gamma analysis of film dose versus computed dose for two sets of criteria: 2 %/ 2 mm and 3 %/ 3 mm. For extreme configurations (3 cm tumor, 1. 3 <b>modulation</b> <b>factor,</b> 15 cm off-axis position), effects on dose distributions were significant with 89. 3 % and 95. 4 % of the points passing gamma tests with 2 %/ 2 mm and 3 %/ 3 mm criteria, respectively, for TPS software version 4. 0. x (51 gantry angles). For the 4. 1. x version (153 gantry angles), excellent agreement was observed for all cases: the passing rate was 100 % for both gamma criteria. · Comparison TPS-TomoPen Figure 1 shows a comparison for a particular case between dose profiles computed with Tomo-HD unit (version 4. 1. x) and TomoPen. Differences between Tomo-HD and TomoPen for 153 and 459 gantry angles are negligible (within 1 %/ 1 mm). However, significant differences are observed when comparing Tomo-HD and TomoPen for 51 gantry angles. With a smaller <b>modulation</b> <b>factor,</b> agreement is worse for dose distributions computed with 51 gantry angles with an additional deviation of up to 3 % of prescribed dose within the target. TomoPen for 51 gantry angles reproduces the behavior of software version installed on Hi-Art machine (4. 0. x, 51 gantry angles). The differences showed by TomoPen confirmed the qualitative predictions of the analytical model. Those results confirmed that the measured effect comes from the discretization of gantry rotation only. FIG. 2. Comparison between computed dose profiles acquired perpendicular to off-axis direction using Tomo-HD software (version 4. 1. x) and TomoPen for 51, 153 or 459 gantry angles. This configuration is 3 cm target size, 15 cm off-axis for actual <b>modulation</b> <b>factors</b> of 1. 3 for (a) and <b>modulation</b> <b>factor</b> of 1. 7 for (b). IV. Conclusion A sufficient number of gantry angles is necessary during dose computation to ensure planning robustness versus target off-axis position, low <b>modulation</b> <b>factors,</b> and small target sizes, as it may occur in SBRT treatments. This study, published in medical physics 2, showed that the use of 51 gantry positions could lead to significant deviations for off-axis positions of more than 10 cm. However, the use of 153 gantry angles was showed sufficient to cope with all configurations tested during this study, even the most extreme. Although versions 4. 1. x and above of TomoTherapy TPS software do implement 153 gantry angles in “get full dose” and “full scatter” iterations, the effect can only be corrected by iterating in “full scatter” mode, which is unpractical in current systems. New releases of TomoTherapy TPS, with GPU implementation 3, might solve the problem by allowing iterations including 153 gantry angles at practical speed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{quantify}} systematically {{the effect}} on accuracy of discretizing gantry rotation during the dose calculation process of TomoTherapy treatments. Methods: Up to version 4. 0. x included, TomoTherapy treatment planning system (TPS) approximates gantry rotation by computing dose from 51 discrete angles corresponding {{to the center of}} the projections used to control the binary multileaf collimator. Potential effects on dose computation accuracy for off-Axis targets and low <b>modulation</b> <b>factors</b> have been shown previously for a few treatment configurations. In versions 4. 1. x and later, TomoTherapy oversamples the projections to better account for gantry rotation, but only during full scatter optimization and final calculation (i. e., not during optimization in beamlet mode). The effect on accuracy of changing the number of angles was quantified with the following framework: (1) predict the impact of the discretization of gantry rotation for various <b>modulation</b> <b>factors,</b> target sizes, and off-Axis positions using a simplified analytical algorithm; (2) perform regular quality assurance using measurements with EDR 2 radiographic films; (3) isolating the effect of changing the number of discretized angles only (51, 153, and 459) using a previously validated Monte Carlo model (TomoPen).

Results: For extreme configurations (3 cm tumor, 1. 3 <b>modulation</b> <b>factor,</b> 15 cm off-Axis position), effects on dose distributions were significant with 89. 3 and 95. 4 of the points passing gamma tests with 22 mm and 33 mm criteria, respectively, for TPS software version 4. 0. x (51 gantry angles). The passing rate was 100 for both gamma criteria for the 4. 1. x version (153 gantry angles). Those differences could be attributed almost completely to gantry motion discretization using TomoPen. Using 51 gantry angles for dose computation, TomoPen reproduced within statistical uncertainties (1 standard deviation) dose distributions computed with version 4. 0. x. Using 153 and 459 gantry angles, TomoPen reproduced within statistical uncertainties measurements and dose distributions computed with version 4. 1. x. Conclusions: When low <b>modulation</b> <b>factors</b> and significant off-Axis positions are used, accounting for gantry rotation during dose computation using at least 153 gantry angles is required to ensure optimal accuracy. © 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to assess the economic viability of a certain form of Demand Response providing primary frequency control. Automatic control is provided by the management of a large population of small electric loads. Loads adapt their instantaneous power consumption using a single <b>modulation</b> <b>factor</b> shared amongst the whole population. This single <b>modulation</b> <b>factor</b> is constrained to evolve within certain limits. The paper discusses how such a control could be of semi-autonomous nature. Indeed, loads would be able to react on a decentralized way by relying on local information and participate very actively to primary control. Feedback information about the average characteristics of the group must be provided. As these characteristics are not changing rapidly, information may be sent on regular time interval. The required information refreshment rate is expected to be sufficiently slow such that it would not hamper the control dynamics and allow for fast delivery of flexible capacity. The most constraining control limits lie in the fact that energy consumption of each load is conserved. Therefore, the control consists in energy consumption shifting. The amount of energy that can be shifted is actually limited by the lower and upper bounds of the <b>modulation</b> <b>factor.</b> Providing a constant flexible capacity requires to couple the control with an energy recovery mechanism. This paper considers energy compensation through purchase/sale of energy on the balancing market. A linear optimisation model is built.

It results in maximising the participation of loads in the primary control while compensating energy in the most optimal way (price arbitrage).

Here we present evidence for a pathway and associated genetic factors (namely, the ribosome <b>modulation</b> <b>factor</b> RMF and ppGpp) in Escherichia coli that contribute to heightened levels of gene expression noise during stationary phase. Endogenous cellular mechanisms that globally affect gene expression noise, such as those identified in this study, could provide phenotypic diversity under adverse conditions such as stationary phase...|$|R
25|$|The wind {{generation}} {{potential in}} the United States far exceeds demand. There are only two states with no commercially significant wind power potential, Mississippi and Florida. Florida {{has the potential to}} install 900 MW at 25% capacity <b>factor</b> 100 <b>meter</b> high turbines, and Mississippi the potential to install 30,000 MW at 25% capacity <b>factor</b> 100 <b>meter</b> high turbines. For commercial operation, a capacity factor of at least 35% is preferred. There are no locations in either state that would achieve 30% capacity factor. In contrast, North Dakota, the windiest state, has the capacity to install 200,000 MW at 50% capacity <b>factor</b> 100 <b>meter</b> high turbines. Texas, although not as windy, is larger, and has the capacity to install 250,000 MW at 50% capacity factor, and 1,757,355.6 MW of at least 35% capacity factor, capable of generating 6,696,500 GWh/year, more than all of the electricity generated in the United States in 2010.|$|R
40|$|A hidden (local) symmetry(HLS) {{formalism}} with two-photon {{approach is}} performed {{based on the}} effective quantum many-body theory. The possible electromagnetic(EM) under-screening as well as screening effects between electric charged point-like electrons and composite protons are discussed by formally analyzing isospin mixing due to EM photon. The main conclusion is that the weak repulsive random Coulomb force between like-charged collective electrons give a negative pressure contribution to equation of state(EOS), an effective attractive interaction due to <b>modulation</b> <b>factor</b> of opposite charged fluid background through dragging effects, which is also of strongly correlating characteristic...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} first results from an X-ray {{polarimeter}} with a micropattern gas proportional counter using an amorphous silicon active matrix readout. With 100 % polarized X-rays at 4. 5 keV, we obtain a <b>modulation</b> <b>factor</b> of 0. 33 +/- 0. 03, confirming previous {{reports of the}} high polarization sensitivity of a finely segmented pixel proportional counter. The detector described here has a geometry suitable for the focal plane of an astronomical X-ray telescope. Amorphous silicon readout technology will enable additional extensions and improvements.
