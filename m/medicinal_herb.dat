5|$|Lettuce {{appears in}} many medieval writings, {{especially}} as a <b>medicinal</b> <b>herb.</b> Hildegard of Bingen mentioned {{it in her}} writings on medicinal herbs between 1098 and 1179, and many early herbals also describe its uses. In 1586, Joachim Camerarius provided descriptions of the three basic modern lettuces– head lettuce, loose-leaf lettuce, and romaine (or cos) lettuce. Lettuce was first brought to the Americas from Europe by Christopher Columbus in the late 15th century. Between the late 16th century and the early 18th century, many varieties were developed in Europe, particularly Holland. Books published in the mid-18th and early 19th centuries describe several varieties found in gardens today.|$|E

This written record also reveals that tea was processed and used as a drink instead of a <b>medicinal</b> <b>herb,</b> emerged no later than the 1st century BC. Early Chinese tea culture began from the time of Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) to the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420–589) when tea was widely used by Chinese gentry, but only took its initial shape during the Tang Dynasty (618–907).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its usual purpose as an edible vegetable, cabbage has been used historically as a <b>medicinal</b> <b>herb</b> {{for a variety of}} purported health benefits. For example, the Ancient Greeks recommended consuming the vegetable as a laxative, and used cabbage juice as an antidote for mushroom poisoning, for eye salves, and for liniments used to help bruises heal. In De Agri Cultura (On Agriculture), Cato the Elder suggested that women could prevent diseases by bathing in urine obtained from those who had frequently eaten cabbage. The ancient Roman nobleman Pliny the Elder described both culinary and medicinal properties of the vegetable, recommending it for drunkenness—both preventatively to counter the effects of alcohol and to cure hangovers. Similarly, the Ancient Egyptians ate cooked cabbage at the beginning of meals to reduce the intoxicating effects of wine. This traditional usage persisted in European literature until the mid-20th century.|$|E

500|$|The ancient Chinese society first {{encountered}} the tea plant {{in what is}} now southern China and processed it as another <b>medicinal</b> <b>herb</b> for use in Chinese herbology. The processing technique used to process fresh tea leaves was to immediately steam the fresh tea leaves and dry them for preservation, which is likely the most ancient Chinese form of tea leaf processing. This processing method was perfected {{near the end of the}} Han Dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) and produced a dried tea that would be classified today as [...] "green tea" [...] and quite similar to modern Japanese sencha. For consumption, dried tea leaves were either decocted with water around with other herbs, or ground into a powder to be taken straight, or in a liquid in the manner of matcha.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to its usual purpose as an edible leafy vegetable, lettuce has {{had a number of}} uses in ancient (and even some more modern) times as a <b>medicinal</b> <b>herb</b> and religious symbol. For example, ancient Egyptians thought lettuce to be a symbol of sexual prowess and a promoter of love and childbearing in women. The Romans likewise claimed that it increased sexual potency. In contrast, the ancient Greeks connected the plant with male impotency, and served it during funerals (probably due to its role in the myth of Adonis' death), and British women in the 19th century believed it would cause infertility and sterility. Lettuce has mild narcotic properties; it was called [...] "sleepwort" [...] by the Anglo-Saxons because of this attribute, although the cultivated L. sativa has lower levels of the narcotic than its wild cousins. This narcotic effect is a property of two sesquiterpene lactones which are found in the white liquid (latex) in the stems of lettuce, called lactucarium or [...] "lettuce opium".|$|E

Cheryl Mason's first name is based on actress Sheryl Lee's first name, and Lisa Garland's surname is taken from actress Judy Garland. [...] "Michael Kaufmann" [...] {{is a combination of}} Troma Studios producers Michael Herz's and Lloyd Kaufmann's first name and surname, respectively.

Harry's name was originally [...] "Humbert", and Cheryl's was [...] "Dolores", in reference to the protagonist and title character of Vladimir Nabokov's novel Lolita. The American staff altered these names, as they considered them too uncommon. Fictitious religious items appearing in the game have used various religions as a basis: the evil spirit-dispelling substance Aglaophotis, which is said to be made from a <b>medicinal</b> <b>herb,</b> is based on a herb of similar name and nature in the Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism); the [...] "Seal of Metatron" [...] (also referred to by Dahlia as the [...] "Mark of Samael") references the angels Metatron and Samael, respectively; {{and the name of the}} [...] "Flauros" [...] was taken from the eponymous demon appearing in the Lemegeton, a book on magic said to have been compiled by writings of King Solomon. Certain items and doors in the [...] "nowhere" [...] dimension of the game were given names based on occult elements in order to symbolize magical traits of Dahlia. The names of these doors were taken from the names of the angels Ophiel, Hagith, Phaleg, and Bethor, who appear in a medieval book of black magic and are supposed to rule over planets. This motif of giving names that suggest planets was used to signify that [...] "a deeper part of the realm of Alessa's mind is being entered," [...] according to Owaku.|$|E
