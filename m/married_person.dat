2500|$|The last graph shown (Figure 167) is a {{combination}} of Figures 165 and 166. In this graph it is very clear why generalizations about the value of Social Security benefits are meaningless. At the $95,000 wage level a <b>married</b> <b>person</b> could be a big winner – getting net benefits of about $165,000. On the other hand, he could lose an estimated $152,000 in net benefits if he remains single. Altogether, there is a [...] "swing" [...] of over $300,000 based upon the marriage decision (and the division of earnings between the spouses). In addition there is a large disparity between the high net benefits of the <b>married</b> <b>person</b> earning $95,000 ($165,152) versus the relatively low net benefits of the man or woman earning just $5,000 ($30,025 or $41,890, depending on gender).

This letter was read in the Grand Council and referred by it to the above-mentioned magistrate for the necessary action. After due consideration of the whole matter he decided that certain married men of Pescia were not and could not be brethren of that Order, but were subject to the jurisdiction of the commune of Pescia.

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{present day}} Western society the {{institution}} of marriage appears to be of great significance for the well-being of the individual. Compared with <b>married</b> <b>persons,</b> the unmarried are generally less happy, less healthy, more disturbed and more prone to premature death. Among the married, happiness and health are highly dependent on marital success. The idea has been floated that the importance of marriage is now gradually declining. It is believed that single life is becoming more satisfying and that <b>married</b> <b>persons</b> are gradually becoming less dependent on their spouses. Empirical data do not substantiate that belief. Firstly, the differences in well-being between unmarried and <b>married</b> <b>persons</b> are becoming greater rather than smaller. In the Netherlands [...] between 1950 and 1980 [...] suicide rates have risen far more among the unmarried than among the married. Furthermore the differences in happiness between unmarried and <b>married</b> <b>persons</b> appear greatest in the most modern European countries, whereas almost no differences exist in the most traditional ones. Secondly, married person' appear to have become more dependent on the relationship with their spouse rather than less. During the last few decades in the Netherlands the overall happiness of married people has become more closely associated with their satisfaction with marriage. These trends can be interpreted as suggesting that marriage is becoming an increasingly indispensable 'haven' in an increasingly 'privatizing' world...|$|R
