5|$|Politically, the Belgians did {{not trust}} the French. Marshal Philippe Pétain had {{suggested}} a French strike at Germany's Ruhr area using Belgium as a spring-board in October 1930 and again in January 1933. Belgium feared it would be drawn into a war regardless, and sought to avoid that eventuality. The Belgians also feared being drawn into a war {{as a result of}} the French–Soviet pact of May 1935. The Franco-Belgian agreement stipulated Belgium was to <b>mobilise</b> if the Germans did, but what was not clear was whether Belgium would have to <b>mobilise</b> in the event of a German invasion of Poland.|$|E

5|$|Between February 17 and February 19, 1975, North Vietnamese field {{commanders in}} the Central Highlands Front held a conference to plan for their {{upcoming}} offensive. In order to plan their combat strategy, North Vietnamese commanders assessed the potential obstacles faced by the Vietnam People’s Army {{and the strength of}} the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) in the Central Highlands. Following extensive discussions, North Vietnamese commanders concluded that the South Vietnamese army in the Central Highlands could <b>mobilise</b> about 5–7 regiment-sized units to counter the upcoming offensive. In the worst-case scenario, if South Vietnamese units were not tied up elsewhere, North Vietnamese commanders thought that South Vietnam could probably <b>mobilise</b> between nine and twelve regiments. North Vietnamese commanders believed South Vietnam could deploy about one or two armoured brigades, three to five battalions of artillery, and 80 aircraft per day to support the army. The North Vietnamese commanders within the Central Highlands Front discussed the possibility of the United States re-entering the conflict, which they believed would see the commitment of about 100 fighter-bombers from the United States Seventh Fleet.|$|E
5|$|The French Navy and Air Force {{had been}} {{depleted}} during World War II. They {{were unable to}} deal with the unexpectedly large number of refugees. This was exacerbated by their unwillingness to allow civilian evacuees to travel on trains from outlying districts to Hanoi and Haiphong, as their priority was evacuating their military personnel and equipment. France asked Washington for assistance, so the US Department of Defense ordered the US Navy to <b>mobilise</b> an evacuation task force.|$|E

He deliberately sailed via a circuitous route to minimise {{the possibility of}} an encounter with the British, should they sail from New York in pursuit. Washington and Rochambeau, in the meantime, had crossed the Hudson on 24 August, leaving some troops behind as a ruse to delay any potential move on the part of General Clinton to <b>mobilise</b> assistance for Cornwallis.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{continued}} west up the Thames Valley, reaching Gloucester between 9 and 12 October; {{he hoped}} to reach Wales and from there <b>mobilise</b> an army against the invaders. Mortimer and Isabella were not far behind. Proclamations condemned the Despensers' recent regime. Day-by-day they gathered new supporters Edward and the younger Despenser crossed over the border and set sail from Chepstow, probably aiming first for Lundy and then for Ireland, where the King hoped to receive refuge and raise a fresh army. Bad weather drove them back, though, and they landed at Cardiff. Edward retreated to Caerphilly Castle and attempted to rally his remaining forces.|$|E

General Trưởng also ordered the ARVN 2nd Infantry Regiment (3rd Infantry Division) to depart from Da Nang, and protect Tam Kỳ, so that General Nhut's forces could be free up to fight the North Vietnamese.|$|E
5|$|The Yugoslav coup d'état led to {{a sudden}} change in the plan of attack and confronted the Twelfth Army {{with a number of}} {{difficult}} problems. According to the 28 March Directive No. 25, the Twelfth Army was to create a mobile task force to attack via Niš toward Belgrade. With only nine days left before their final deployment, every hour became valuable and each fresh assembly of troops took time to <b>mobilise.</b> By the evening of 5 April, the forces intended to enter southern Yugoslavia and Greece had been assembled.|$|E
5|$|The regulars and reserves—at {{least on}} paper—totalled a <b>mobilised</b> force of almost 700,000 men, {{although}} only 150,000 men were immediately available to be formed into the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) {{that was sent}} to the continent. This consisted of six infantry divisions and one of cavalry. By contrast, the French Army in 1914 <b>mobilised</b> 1,650,000 troops and 62 infantry divisions, while the German Army <b>mobilised</b> 1,850,000 troops and 87 infantry divisions.|$|R

After the successful Battle of Smolensk, Hitler ordered Army Group Centre to halt its advance to Moscow and temporarily divert its Panzer groups {{to aid in}} the encirclement of Leningrad and Kiev. This pause provided the Red Army with an opportunity to <b>mobilise</b> fresh reserves. The Moscow offensive, which resumed in October 1941, ended disastrously in December. On 7 December 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Four days later, Germany declared war on the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan was}} {{launched}} on 7 July 1810 as two combined forces of British sailors, soldiers, sepoys and Royal Marines landed at separate beaches. Although {{a number of}} men were drowned in the heavy surf, {{the majority of the}} invasion force reached the beaches safely and marched inland, attacking French outposts as they approached the capital. Recognising that his demoralised garrison would be unable to defend Saint Denis and that the militia would take too long to <b>mobilise,</b> the French commander Colonel Chrysostôme de Sainte-Suzanne surrendered the island, its garrison and its stores to Rowley.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of each colossal head {{must have been}} carefully planned, given the effort required to ensure the necessary resources were available; {{it seems likely that}} only the more powerful Olmec rulers were able to <b>mobilise</b> such resources. The workforce would have included sculptors, labourers, overseers, boatmen, woodworkers and other artesans producing the tools to make and move the monument, in addition to the support needed to feed and otherwise attend to these workers. The seasonal and agricultural cycles and river levels needed to have been taken into account to plan the {{production of}} the monument and the whole project may well have taken years from beginning to end.|$|E

5|$|After a brief hiatus {{during the}} 1906 general election, which the Liberals {{won by a}} landslide, obtaining a {{majority}} of 126 seats in the House of Commons, Haldane {{turned his attention to}} the Tangier Crisis, which had almost brought France and Germany to war in December. Sir Edward Grey, the Foreign Secretary, had privately agreed to commit the Army to the aid of France, if attacked, and Haldane began to consider how best to accomplish this. He quickly concluded that there was a need for a regular expeditionary force, specifically prepared and trained for use as a continental intervention force. The question now became how to provide this force, and after a short period Haldane settled on a strength of six infantry divisions and their supporting units. They would need to be organised in peacetime and prepared to <b>mobilise</b> in the United Kingdom, as they would be committed into action as soon as they reached the Continent.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of this}} Popular Revolution, Gaddafi invited Libya's {{people to}} found General People's Committees as {{conduits}} for raising political consciousness. Although offering little guidance for {{how to set up}} these councils, Gaddafi claimed that they would offer a form of direct political participation that was more democratic than a traditional party-based representative system. He hoped that the councils would <b>mobilise</b> the people behind the RCC, erode the power of the traditional leaders and the bureaucracy, and allow for a new legal system chosen by the people. Many such committees were established in schools and colleges, where they were responsible for vetting staff, courses, and textbooks to determine if they were compatible with the country's revolutionary ideology.|$|E
5|$|By early 1101, Henry's {{new regime}} was {{established}} and functioning, {{but many of}} the Anglo-Norman elite still supported Robert, or would be prepared to switch sides if Henry's elder brother appeared likely to gain power in England. In February, Flambard escaped from the Tower of London and crossed the Channel to Normandy, where he injected fresh direction and energy to Robert's attempts to <b>mobilise</b> an invasion force. By July, Robert had formed an army and a fleet, ready to move against Henry in England. Raising the stakes in the conflict, Henry seized Flambard's lands and, with the support of Anselm, Flambard was removed from his position as bishop. Henry held court in April and June, where the nobility renewed their oaths of allegiance to him, but their support still appeared partial and shaky.|$|E

5|$|By late December 1991, {{just over}} a month after victory had been proclaimed in Vukovar, opinion polls found that 64 percent wanted {{to end the war}} {{immediately}} and only 27 percent were willing for it to continue. Milošević and other senior Serbian leaders decided against continuing the fighting, as they saw it as politically impossible to <b>mobilise</b> more conscripts to fight in Croatia. Desertions from the JNA continued as the well-motivated and increasingly well-equipped Croatian Army became more difficult to counter. By the end of 1991, Serbia's political and military leadership concluded that it would be counter-productive to continue the war. The looming conflict in Bosnia also required that the military resources tied up in Croatia be freed for future use.|$|E
5|$|However, in {{the same}} year Alfred won a decisive victory against the Danes at the Battle of Edington, and he {{exploited}} the fear of the Viking threat to raise large numbers of men and using a network of defended towns called burhs to defend his territory and <b>mobilise</b> royal resources. Suppressing internal opposition to his rule, Alfred contained the invaders within a region known as the Danelaw. Under his son, Edward the Elder, and his grandson, Æthelstan, Wessex expanded further north into Mercia and the Danelaw, and by the 950s and the reigns of Eadred and Edgar, York was finally permanently retaken from the Vikings. The West Saxon rulers were now kings of the Angelcynn, that is of the whole English folk.|$|E
5|$|In 1241, the barons in Poitou, {{including}} Henry's step-father Hugh de Lusignan, {{rebelled against}} {{the rule of}} Louis of France. The rebels had counted on aid from Henry, but he lacked domestic support and was slow to <b>mobilise</b> an army, not arriving in France until the next summer. Henry's campaign was hesitant and was further undermined by Hugh switching sides and returning to support Louis. On 20 May Henry's army was surrounded by the French at Taillebourg; Henry's brother Richard persuaded the French to delay their attack and the King {{took the opportunity to}} escape to Bordeaux. Simon de Montfort, who fought a successful rearguard action during the withdrawal, was furious with the King's incompetence and told Henry that he should be locked up like the 10th-century Carolingian king Charles the Simple. The Poitou rebellion collapsed and Henry entered into a fresh five-year truce; his campaign had been a disastrous failure and had cost over £80,000.|$|E
