5000|$|Nikolai Nekrasov met Avdotya Panayeva in 1842 {{when she}} was already a {{promising}} writer and a popular hostess of a literary salon. The 26-year-old Nekrasov fell in love but had to wait several years for her emotional response and at least on one occasion {{was on the verge}} of suicide, if one of his Panayeva Cycle poems, [...] "Some time ago, rejected by you... is to be believed. For several years she was [...] "struggling with her feelings" [...] (according to Chernyshevsky), then in 1847 succumbed.

500|$|An {{offensive}} minded player {{throughout his}} amateur and minor professional career, St. Louis {{was forced into}} a checking-line role by the Calgary Flames. He credits the experience for rounding out his game: [...] "I played a true third-line role, killing penalties and playing against the other team's top lines. For me, {{it was like a}} five-month crash course on developing my defensive game. <b>My</b> <b>whole</b> <b>life,</b> I had been an offensive player, and suddenly I was in the role of trying to be smart without the puck. I think those fifty-six games helped me develop into a complete player." ...|$|E
500|$|A May 2007 {{survey by}} Britain's Sky Movies listed Dirty Dancing as numberone on [...] "Women's most-watched films", above the Star Wars trilogy, Grease, The Sound of Music, and Pretty Woman.

5000|$|Nor was Andersson quite {{satisfied}} with his own work; in 2008, when he received the Carnegie Art Award first prize of SEK 1,000,000, he said: [...] "I've worked hard <b>my</b> <b>whole</b> damned <b>life,</b> sacrificing myself and so much else for the art.

50|$|Many of {{you know}} I’ve {{struggled}} with addiction <b>my</b> <b>whole</b> adult <b>life,</b> so in early May I voluntarily checked myself into a 30-day in-patient drug and alcohol treatment center to finally {{try to do something}} about it. For years I’ve fought back just hard enough to keep it together and stay alive, but the on-again/off again lifestyle inevitably left me demoralized and broken, and negatively impacted everyone around me.|$|R
500|$|During {{his first}} game for the Cubs, Banks {{received}} a visit from Jackie Robinson that influenced his quiet presence in baseball. Robinson told Banks, [...] "Ernie, I'm glad to see you're up here so now just listen and learn...For years, I didn't talk and {{learned a lot about}} people". Later, when Banks felt like becoming more vocal, he discussed the issue with teammate Billy Williams, who advised him to remain quiet. Williams drew the analogy of fish that are caught once they open their mouths. Banks said, [...] "I kept my mouth shut but tried to make a difference. <b>My</b> <b>whole</b> <b>life,</b> I've just wanted to make people better".|$|E
500|$|On 29 May, al-Tamimi {{was sentenced}} to time served of {{thirteen}} months' imprisonment, and an additional two suspended sentences.

Under the terms of al-Tamimi's suspended sentences, he would be imprisoned for two months if he participated in an illegal demonstration within {{two years of the}} sentencing, and imprisoned for seven months if he participated in [...] "activity against the security forces" [...] within five years. Responding to the suspended sentences, al-Tamimi said, [...] "I feel that <b>my</b> <b>whole</b> <b>life</b> is under the surveillance of the judge." ...|$|E
500|$|Scheyer set the ACC all-time single-season {{record for}} minutes played in 2009–10 (with 1,470, passing Dennis Scott). [...] Scheyer said: [...] "I {{feel as though}} this is what I've {{prepared}} <b>my</b> <b>whole</b> <b>life</b> to do. There's never a time in a game when I feel I'm winded."

6000|$|... "I {{made him}} no answer, for I {{had no answer}} to give. Disputing his right to claim me from anybody {{would have been a}} mere waste of words.

But the mere attempt to raise it would, as he was well aware, lead {{necessarily}} to the exposure of <b>my</b> <b>whole</b> past <b>life.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I find," [...] said he, [...] "you are {{a little}} given to the sin of authorship which I renounce. If the anecdotes I have given you of my story are of any interest, you may make use of them; but come down to Doubting Castle and see how we live, and I'll give you <b>my</b> <b>whole</b> London <b>life</b> over a social glass; and a {{rattling}} history it shall be about authors and reviewers." ...|$|R
5000|$|She {{has been}} {{serving on the}} Board of Governors at Robert Blackburn Printmaking Workshop, New York City since 2005. She merges {{personal}} contemplations with childlike, lyrical paintings in bright hues. Her introspective side about her personal situations finds its way on to the canvases in form of buildings, airplanes and other object seen as homes."I like to play with ideas of intensity that exude a lyrical symbolism", said Sabharwal. She confesses to being a colourist giving her works a bright palette. [...] "I meditate on the colours I'll use," [...] she says, adding, [...] "They reflect my emotional temperature." [...] In Sabharwal's words, “I go to India to meet my friends and sometimes to showcase my artwork. ‘Tara the artist’ has no start or end. Art is <b>my</b> <b>whole</b> <b>life’s</b> purpose. It’s all the in between spaces; like looking through {{the corner of my}} eye while talking and noticing light and colors from which I make connections and find meaning.” ...|$|R
500|$|In a small essay, [...] "Shmendrick, My Mephistopheles", one of {{the last}} {{passages}} he wrote, Adler describes the last time he saw Shmendrick played, at a memorial for Goldfaden in 1912. Lamenting the choice of play for the memorial—"Goldfaden has written better things"—he nonetheless acknowledges, [...] "that same bitter Shmendrick was our livelihood... I gritted my teeth. I called on the ghosts of Aristophanes, of Shakespeare, of Lope de Vega. I wept and swallowed my own tears... And I cursed the fate that bound me to him... Yet even as I cursed and condemned, the tears rose. For <b>my</b> <b>whole</b> <b>life,</b> my whole past, was before me on that stage... Poor weak first step of our Yiddish theater... I thank you for the happiness you gave us... I thank you Shmendrick—my beloved—my own." ...|$|E
500|$|News of {{the murder}} spread fast in U.S. {{newspapers}} and a swell of anti-Italian sentiment spread across New York. Cascioferro pleaded his innocence and provided an alibi for the entire period when Petrosino was assassinated. He stayed {{in the house of}} De Michele Ferrantelli in Burgio. However, the alibi provided by De Michele Ferrantelli was suspicious, taking into account the relation between the two. Moreover, while in jail after his arrest and life sentence in 1930, Cascioferro apparently claimed that he had killed Petrosino. According to writer Arrigo Petacco in his 1972 book on Joe Petrosino, Cascioferro said: [...] "In <b>my</b> <b>whole</b> <b>life</b> I have killed only one person, and I did that disinterestedly … Petrosino was a brave adversary, and deserved better than a shameful death at the hands of some hired cut-throat." ...|$|E
500|$|She called Betsey Johnson {{a fashion}} inspiration: [...] " [...] {{is a free}} spirit. When I met her the other day, I felt like I knew her for <b>my</b> <b>whole</b> <b>life.</b> She's so warm and {{considerate}} and caring. She's amazingly talented and I've been wearing her clothes forever, so to meet her was like, 'Yay!' [...] bowing down to her; she's dope!" [...] Minaj has also expressed appreciation for Cyndi Lauper's style and how her videos inspired her as a teenager: [...] "When I first went to get my hair colored, I was about 14 and I wanted blonde highlights. The beautician said, 'No, {{you have to get}} your mother on the phone,' and I was just crying and begging. I've always been experimenting. Cyndi Lauper's videos – that's what intrigued me." ...|$|E
5000|$|He {{declared}} himself a hostile witness, describing {{the case as}} a [...] "squalid little squabble" [...] but was ordered to answer questions by the judge. He said: [...] "I am here under the strongest possible protest. ... Your client, I have to say, the News of the World, symbolises everything that as a socialist I have stood against <b>my</b> <b>whole</b> adult <b>life.</b> ... It should have been settled by one of both parties before innocent people were dragged into this bizarre pantomime." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh. I {{may have}} spent <b>my</b> <b>whole</b> natural <b>life</b> in denouncing him as demoralization incarnate, and a curse to the community, but I always liked him, Ellen. Yes, I loved J. Milton, and I was merely {{waiting for him}} to prove himself a {{first-class}} scoundrel, to find out just how much I loved him. I've no doubt but if we could have him among us again, in the attractive garb of the State's-prison inmates, I should be hand and glove with brother Northwick." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Don't {{sell that}} piano at any price, for it holds <b>my</b> <b>whole</b> artistic <b>life</b> inside it. I {{have had it}} in my ears since 1822: there were murmured the Annas, the Maries, the Faustas, the Lucias, the Robertos, the Belisarios, the Marinos, the Martyrs, the Olivos, Ajo, Furioso, Paria, Castello di Kenilworth, Ugo, Pazzi, Pia, Rudenz....Oh, let it live as long as I live! I lived with it in my age of hope, my married life, my loneliness..." [...] (Letter to Vasselli, July 3, 1843) ...|$|R
