5|$|In {{the postwar}} period, Lawton {{underwent}} tremendous growth {{during the late}} 1940s and 1950s, leading city officials to seek additional water sources to supplement existing water from Lake Lawtonka.

Lake Ellsworth, named for a former Lawton mayor, soft-drink bottler C.R. Ellsworth, was dedicated in the early 1960s. It offered additional water resources, but also recreational opportunities and flood control along Cache Creek.|$|E

As much as 90percent of the upper Trinity River watershed was diverted for agriculture in the Central Valley. In 1991 environmental regulations were enacted, requiring a greater release of water to the Trinity River in order to protect fish.
