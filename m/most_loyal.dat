5|$|Gannon {{began his}} playing career at Dundalk, but moved to English club Sheffield United in 1989. The {{next year he}} {{transferred}} to Stockport County, following a short loan spell with Halifax Town. He spent {{the next ten years}} at Stockport, becoming one of the club's <b>most</b> <b>loyal</b> servants, and helped the club to second-place finishes in both the Second Division and Fourth Division, as well as two Football League Trophy finals. After leaving the club in 2000, he spent a season with Crewe Alexandra, before returning to Ireland with Shelbourne, winning two League of Ireland Premier Division titles in his three years there.|$|E
5|$|Mura {{also has}} support during their matches from their ultras group, named the Black Gringos. Statistically, both teams always enjoyed {{one of the}} biggest attendances on their matches and, in term of numbers, both teams had one of the largest fan bases in the country. The fact that Prekmurje is one of the {{smallest}} and least populated regions in Slovenia has made Mura's fans labeled, by the general public, as one of the <b>most</b> <b>loyal</b> in the country. Statistically, Maribor is the more successful club, considering either the case of matches from the period from 1967 to 2005, or the whole period from 1967 to present day.|$|E

They go {{by the name of}} the Waltham Blacks (tho few of them live there) which is a <b>most</b> <b>loyal</b> little town...I once saw two hundred and upwards of these Blacks in a body within half a mile of my house. They had been running brandy. There was 24 customs officers following them who they abused heartily and carried off their cargo. I am told there is no less than a thousand of them and indeed I believe they have now taken loyalty into their heads, and will I hope prove very useful.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, oaths {{were taken}} very seriously. As King, James was Head of the Church of Scotland or Kirk, sworn by his Coronation Oath to {{preserve}} its position and privileges. The Test Act required government officials and MPs to swear an Oath of Allegiance to the Protestant religion and the monarch, regardless of personal religion. James thus received their support despite his own Catholicism but promised not to diminish {{the primacy of the}} Church of Scotland. Removing these restrictions was seen as contrary to that commitment. Many MPs were also members of the Episcopalian minority imposed on the Kirk in 1661; Argyll's defeat showed the weakening of Presbyterian influence but voting for these measures would undo that. James' credibility was seriously damaged, since he appeared willing to ignore his previous commitments, his Coronation Oath and his <b>most</b> <b>loyal</b> supporters.|$|E
5|$|Richard's <b>most</b> <b>loyal</b> {{subject was}} John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk. The duke had served Richard's brother {{for many years}} and had been one of Edward IV's closer confidants. He was a {{military}} veteran, having fought in the Battle of Towton in 1461 and served as Hastings' deputy at Calais in 1471. Ross speculates that he may have borne a grudge against Edward for depriving him of a fortune. Norfolk was due to inherit a share of the wealthy Mowbray estate on the death of eight-year-old Anne de Mowbray, the last of her family. However, Edward convinced Parliament to circumvent the law of inheritance and transfer the estate to his younger son, who was married to Anne. Consequently, Howard supported Richard III in deposing Edward's sons, for which he received the dukedom of Norfolk and his original share of the Mowbray estate.|$|E

5|$|A {{new era of}} castle {{construction}} {{began when}} the daimyo Nobunaga built Azuchi Castle from 1576 to 1579. Earlier fortifications of the Kamakura and Muromachi periods were crude large scale structures; Azuchi, however, with rich ornamentation and a keep rising seven stories high, became the prototype for castle construction of the period. The style of Azuchi Castle marked {{a shift in the}} function of the castles from a place that was merely a fortress and military garrison to a political, cultural and economic center. The newer style castles functioned as home to the daimyo, his family, and his <b>most</b> <b>loyal</b> retainers. Because of the expense of building such a lavish structure, castles in the style of Azuchi, functioned also to highlight the power and prestige of the daimyo. These new castles were built of wood and plaster on a stone foundation. Generally the main keep or tenshu was positioned at the highest point, surrounded by a series of interlocking baileys with walls, small towers and pathways. Residential buildings were located in one of the outer circles. The daimyo conducted his business in the citadel.|$|E
5|$|In 1761, Zahir {{ordered his}} son Uthman al-Zahir to assassinate Zahir's brother Sa'd because the latter had been collaborating with Uthman Pasha and the Bani Saqr tribe to kill Zahir and replace him. Sa'd's {{assassination}} indirectly {{led to the}} first conflict between Zahir and his sons, in this case Uthman. The latter had been promised control over Shefa-'Amr in return for killing Sa'd, but Zahir reneged due to pleas by Shefa-'Amr's residents not to appoint Uthman as their governor. Backed by his full-brothers Ahmad and Sa'd al-Din, who were angered by Zahir's refusal to cede them more territory, Uthman besieged Shefa-'Amr in 1765. However, under Zahir's instructions, the locals in the vicinity defended the town and succeeded in preventing its capture. The three brothers then appealed to Zahir's eldest and <b>most</b> <b>loyal</b> son, Salibi, to intervene on their behalf with Zahir, but Salibi was unable to persuade Zahir to make concessions. The four brothers then attempted to rekindle their alliance with the Bani Saqr, who Zahir had since routed at the Marj Ibn Amer plain in 1762.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Đính was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} III Corps, which oversaw the region surrounding the capital Saigon. He was given the post because Diệm regarded {{him as one of}} his <b>most</b> <b>loyal</b> officers. This position meant that Đính would be important to {{the success or failure of}} any coup. In late 1963, with Diệm becoming increasingly unpopular, Đính's colleagues recruited him into a coup by playing on his ego. They convinced him to ask Diệm for a cabinet post, knowing that the president was adamantly opposed to military officers serving as ministers and would chastise him. Diệm promptly rebuffed Đính, who became upset and was lured into the plot. Diệm and his brother and chief advisor Ngô Đình Nhu were aware of a coup plot, but did not know of Đính's involvement. Nhu planned a fake coup of his own in an attempt to trap his opponents and generate positive publicity for his family's regime. He put Đính in charge of the fake coup, and the general promptly redeployed loyal units outside Saigon and rebel forces near the capital. On 1 November 1963, the rebels' actual coup proceeded, and the Ngô brothers were deposed and executed.|$|E

5|$|Qutlubugha's {{recognition}} of Ahmad as sultan was officially {{an act of}} mutiny since it was done while al-Ashraf Kujuk technically held office. It led to divisions among the Syrian Mamluk leadership, with the governors of Safad, Tripoli and Homs led by Altunbugha al-Salihi of Damascus supporting Qawsun, while Tashtamur, Qutlubugha, the governor of Gaza, the Al Fadl tribe of Palmyra, {{and a number of}} Damascene emirs supporting an-Nasir Ahmad. As Altunbugha left Damascus to lead an expedition against Tashtamur, pursuing the latter to southeastern Anatolia, Qutlubugha moved into Damascus where he proclaimed an-Nasir Ahmad sultan and began to reorganize the bureaucracy with the support of Damascene emirs opposed to Altunbugha. Qutlubugha prepared to strike Altunbugha, who attempted to wrest back control of Damascus, but most of his forces defected and he escaped to Cairo. Afterward, the governors of Damascus, Safad, Gaza, Hama, and Baalbek formally recognized an-Nasir Ahmad as sultan, with apparent popular support. Nonetheless, Ahmad insisted that he remain in al-Karak instead of assuming the sultanate in Damascus unless Tashtamur, his <b>most</b> <b>loyal</b> supporter, accompanied him to Damascus from Anatolia. In the meantime, he gave Qutlubugha the authority to appoint Syrian governors as the new na'ib al-saltana (viceroy) of Syria. At one point during the political machinations in al-Karak, some of Ahmad's mamluks killed Shuhayb, an act which emotionally traumatized Ahmad.|$|E
5|$|The second {{development}} was that President Habyarimana {{announced that he}} was introducing multi-party politics into the country, following intense pressure from the international community, including his <b>most</b> <b>loyal</b> ally France. Habyarimana had originally promised this in mid-1990, and a number of opposition groups had formed in the months since, including the Republican Democratic Movement (MDR), Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the Liberal Party (PL), but the one-party state law had remained in place. In mid-1991, Habyarimana officially allowed multi-party politics to begin, a change which saw a plethora of additional new parties come into existence. Many had manifestos which favoured full democracy and rapprochement with the RPF, but in reality were quite ineffective and had no political influence. The older opposition groups registered themselves as official parties, and the country was notionally moving towards a multi-party inclusive cabinet with proper representation, but progress was continually hampered by the regime. The last opposition party to form was the Coalition for the Defence of the Republic (CDR), which was more hardline Hutu than Habyarimana's own party and had close links to the akazu.|$|E
