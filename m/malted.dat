5|$|The starch {{source in}} a beer {{provides}} the fermentable material {{and is a}} key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer. The most common starch source used in beer is <b>malted</b> grain. Grain is <b>malted</b> by soaking it in water, allowing it to begin germination, and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln. Malting grain produces enzymes that convert starches in the grain into fermentable sugars. Different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain. Darker malts will produce darker beers.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{ingredients}} of beer are water; a starch source, such as <b>malted</b> barley, {{able to be}} saccharified (converted to sugars) then fermented (converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide); a brewer's yeast to produce the fermentation; and a flavouring such as hops. A mixture of starch sources may be used, with a secondary starch source, such as maize (corn), rice or sugar, often being termed an adjunct, especially when used as a lower-cost substitute for <b>malted</b> barley. Less widely used starch sources include millet, sorghum and cassava root in Africa, and potato in Brazil, and agave in Mexico, among others. The amount of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the grain bill.|$|E
5|$|Wheat beer is brewed {{with a large}} {{proportion}} of wheat although it often also contains a significant proportion of <b>malted</b> barley. Wheat beers are usually top-fermented (in Germany they have to be by law). The flavour of wheat beers varies considerably, depending upon the specific style.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{bachelor}} thesis "Possibilities of production and application of special <b>malts</b> for brewing" is to summarize information about special <b>malts</b> made from unusual cereals a and check their application for brewing. There are described properties of barley for <b>malting</b> in {{the introduction of the}} theoretical part. It is focused on manufacture of <b>malt.</b> This process includes income and cleaning of grain, steeping, germination and kilning. There are information about different kinds of <b>malts.</b> It mainly deals with <b>malts</b> from unusual cerals, which contains wheat <b>malt,</b> oat <b>malt,</b> rye <b>malt</b> and triticale <b>malt.</b> The practical part is aimed at beer brewing from wheat <b>malt.</b> Brewing took place in the Litovel brewery...|$|R
5000|$|The {{ingredients}} used are: equal {{measures of}} maize meal, crushed mealie <b>malt</b> (corn <b>malt)</b> and crushed sorghum <b>malt.</b> The maize <b>malt</b> provides a lighter-toned beer with a mellower flavour. The sorghum <b>malt</b> provides a darker beer.|$|R
25|$|The {{hydrometer}} transformed how beer was brewed. Before {{its introduction}} beers were brewed {{from a single}} malt: brown beers from brown <b>malt,</b> amber beers from amber <b>malt,</b> pale beers from pale <b>malt.</b> Using the hydrometer, brewers could calculate the yield from different <b>malts.</b> They observed that pale <b>malt,</b> though more expensive, yielded far more fermentable material than cheaper <b>malts.</b> For example, brown <b>malt</b> (used for Porter) gave 54 pounds of extract per quarter, whilst pale <b>malt</b> gave 80 pounds. Once this was known, brewers switched to using mostly pale <b>malt</b> for all beers supplemented with a small quantity of highly coloured <b>malt</b> to achieve the correct colour for darker beers.|$|R
5|$|Nearly all beer {{includes}} {{barley malt}} {{as the majority}} of the starch. This is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing. After malting, barley is milled, which finally removes the hull, breaking it into large pieces. These pieces remain with the grain during the mash, and act as a filter bed during lautering, when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material. Other <b>malted</b> and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and rye, and less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used. Some brewers have produced gluten-free beer, made with sorghum with no barley malt, for those who cannot consume gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.|$|E
5|$|Beer is {{the oldest}} and most widely {{consumed}} alcoholic drink in the world, and the third most popular drink overall after water and tea. Beer is brewed from cereal grains — most commonly from <b>malted</b> barley, though wheat, maize (corn), and rice are also used. During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer. Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent. Other flavouring agents such as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be included or used instead of hops. In commercial brewing, the natural carbonation effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation.|$|E

40|$|The paracaspase <b>MALT</b> 1 has arginine-directed {{proteolytic}} activity {{triggered by}} engagement of immune receptors. Recruitment of <b>MALT</b> 1 into activation complexes {{is required for}} <b>MALT</b> 1 proteolytic function. Here, co-expression of <b>MALT</b> 1 in HEK 293 cells, either with activated CARD 11 and BCL 10 or with TRAF 6, was used to explore the mechanism of <b>MALT</b> 1 activation at the molecular level. This work identified a prominent self-cleavage site of <b>MALT</b> 1 isoform A (<b>MALT</b> 1 A) at R 781 (R 770 in <b>MALT</b> 1 B) and revealed that TRAF 6 can activate <b>MALT</b> 1 independently of the CBM. Intramolecular cleavage at R 781 /R 770 removes a C-terminal TRAF 6 -binding site in both <b>MALT</b> 1 isoforms, leaving <b>MALT</b> 1 B devoid of the two key interaction sites with TRAF 6. A previously identified auto-proteolysis site of <b>MALT</b> 1 at R 149 leads to deletion of the death-domain, thereby abolishing interaction with BCL 10. By using <b>MALT</b> 1 isoforms and cleaved fragments thereof, as well as TRAF 6 WT and mutant forms, this work shows that TRAF 6 induces N-terminal auto-proteolytic cleavage of <b>MALT</b> 1 at R 149 and accelerates <b>MALT</b> 1 protein turnover. The <b>MALT</b> 1 fragment generated by N-terminal self-cleavage at R 149 was labile and displayed enhanced signaling properties that required an intact K 644 residue, previously {{shown to be a}} site for mono-ubiquitination of <b>MALT</b> 1. Conversely, C-terminal self-cleavage at R 781 /R 770 hampered the ability for self-cleavage at R 149 and stabilized <b>MALT</b> 1 by hindering interaction with TRAF 6. C-terminal self-cleavage had limited impact on <b>MALT</b> 1 A but severely reduced <b>MALT</b> 1 B proteolytic and signaling functions. It also abrogated NF-κB activation by N-terminally cleaved <b>MALT</b> 1 A. Altogether, this study provides further insights into mechanisms that regulate the scaffolding and activation cycle of <b>MALT</b> 1. It also emphasizes the reduced functional capacity of <b>MALT</b> 1 B as compared to <b>MALT</b> 1 A...|$|R

25|$|To produce ethanol from starchy {{materials}} such as cereal grains, the starch must first be converted into sugars.

Results show that <b>malt</b> imported from the EU is least substitutable with <b>malt</b> from other sources, and demand for EU <b>malt</b> is less responsive to changes in price.

5000|$|Flavored <b>malt</b> {{beverages}} are brewery {{products that}} differ from traditional <b>malt</b> beverages such as beer, ale, lager, porter, stout, or <b>malt</b> liquor in several respects. Flavored <b>malt</b> beverages exhibit little or no traditional beer or <b>malt</b> beverage character. Their flavor is derived primarily from added flavors rather than from <b>malt</b> and other materials used in fermentation. At the same time, flavored <b>malt</b> beverages are marketed in traditional beer-type bottles and cans and distributed to the alcohol beverage market through beer and <b>malt</b> beverage wholesalers, and their alcohol content is similar to other <b>malt</b> beverages in the 4-6% alcohol by volume range.Although flavored <b>malt</b> beverages are produced at breweries, their method of production differs significantly from the production of other <b>malt</b> beverages and beer. In producing flavored <b>malt</b> beverages, brewers brew a fermented base of beer from <b>malt</b> and other brewing materials.
