6000|$|While {{the names}} which preceded mine were called off that first afternoon, I grew colder and colder till at last I shook with a nervous chill, and when, in his smooth, {{pleasant}} tenor, Prof. Bush called out [...] "Hamlin Garland" [...] I rose {{in my seat}} with a spring like Jack from his box. My limbs were numb, so numb that I could scarcely feel the floor beneath my feet and the windows were only faint gray glares of light. My head oscillated like a toy balloon, seemed indeed to be floating in the air, and <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> <b>pounding</b> like a drum.|$|E
60|$|If ever a man {{deliberately}} committed murder, Al Hutchins {{did that}} morning in solitary at the Warden's bidding. He robbed me of the little space I stole. And, having robbed me of that, my body was defenceless, and, with his foot in my back while he drew the lacing light, he constricted me as no man had ever before succeeded in doing. So severe was this constriction of my frail frame upon my vital organs that I felt, there and then, immediately, that death was upon me. And still the miracle of faith was mine. I {{did not believe that}} I was going to die. I knew--I say I knew--that I was not going to die. My head was swimming, and <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> <b>pounding</b> from my toenails to the hair-roots in my scalp.|$|E
40|$|I 2 ̆ 7 ve dashed into {{a coffee}} shop and ordered my {{take-away}} flat white. While waiting I observe {{a group of three}} mothers sitting outdoors with prams carefully arranged not to obstruct the flow of customers, enjoying a coffee and chat with babes in arms. One mum is patiently wrestling with her about 1 -month old baby trying to latch him to breastfeed, while the others watch sympathetically, offering support and advice. 2 ̆ 7 He always fusses like this. Sometimes it takes 5 minutes to get him on and by then he 2 ̆ 7 s lost the plot. Being somewhere different seems to make him worse 2 ̆ 7. 2 ̆ 7 Have you had him checked for tongue-tie? 2 ̆ 7 one mother asks knowingly. I listen in, deliberately eavesdropping now. 2 ̆ 7 Yes, the Child Health Nurse had a look but said his mouth is quite normal and the fussing is just his impatience to get the food 2 ̆ 7. She popped a dummy in the baby 2 ̆ 7 s mouth and he calmed down temporarily. My coffee is ready and I sit down for a few sips. 2 ̆ 7 My friend 2 ̆ 7 s baby needed a release for a tongue-tie which many health professionals missed but the chiropractor found. Maybe you should take him to a chiropractor? 2 ̆ 7 The baby squawks spitting out the dummy, and the mother firmly lays his flailing arms across his chest trying valiantly to latch him again. At this point I cannot resist getting involved too, <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> <b>pounding</b> as I introduce myself as an international board certified lactation consultant (IBCLC) 2 ̆ 7 Gosh you 2 ̆ 7 re having a battle there. can I offer a suggestion? 2 ̆ 7 All three pairs of eyes look astonished at my bold intervention, but she gladly agrees 2 ̆ 7 Yes, whatever can help 2 ̆ 7. I verbally guide her to position her baby differently - his hip towards her hip, arms either side of her breast, his chest snuggling in contact with her own and holding him only over his shoulders allowing his head to fall back. She resists allowing his head to be free but complies as his chin rests at the base of her areola. Baby gapes widely and spontaneously latches as my hand supports her hand on his shoulders to maintain a secure hold. The expression on her face tells me she is greatly relieved. 2 ̆ 7 It doesn 2 ̆ 7 t hurt, 2 ̆ 7 she says with a look of disbelief as she stares at me, smiling. 2 ̆ 7 Great, remember what you and your baby have just done. Keep going. You are doing a fantastic job! 2 ̆ 7...|$|R
