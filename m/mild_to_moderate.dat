5|$|Reduction in the {{activity}} of the cholinergic neurons is a well-known feature of Alzheimer's disease. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are employed to reduce the rate at which acetylcholine (ACh) is broken down, thereby increasing the concentration of ACh in the brain and combating the loss of ACh caused by the death of cholinergic neurons. There is evidence for the efficacy of these medications in <b>mild</b> <b>to</b> <b>moderate</b> Alzheimer's disease, and some evidence for their use in the advanced stage. Only donepezil is approved for treatment of advanced AD dementia. The use of these drugs in mild cognitive impairment has not shown any effect in a delay of the onset of AD. The most common side effects are nausea and vomiting, both of which are linked to cholinergic excess. These side effects arise in approximately 10–20% of users, are <b>mild</b> <b>to</b> <b>moderate</b> in severity, and can be managed by slowly adjusting medication doses. Less common secondary effects include muscle cramps, decreased heart rate (bradycardia), decreased appetite and weight, and increased gastric acid production.|$|E

Azelaic acid is thought to be an effective acne treatment due to its ability to reduce skin cell accumulation in the follicle, and its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. It has a slight skin-lightening effect due to its ability to inhibit melanin synthesis, and is therefore useful in treating of individuals with acne who are also affected by postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Azelaic acid may cause skin irritation but is otherwise very safe. It is less effective and more expensive than retinoids.|$|E
5|$|Management of {{low back}} pain depends on which of the three general {{categories}} is the cause: mechanical problems, non-mechanical problems, or referred pain.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the feasibility of}} Tl- 201 SPECT with intracoronary injection (IC-I) in the detection of viable myocardium, we have performed SPECT imaging after direct intracoronary injection of Tl- 201 and images were {{compared with those of}} stress-reinjection (Re-I) SPECT. Methods: Fourteen coronary artery disease patients (male 11, mean age 54 years) who had myocardial infarction or demonstrated left ventricular wall motion abnormality on echocardiography were enrolled. Three mCi of Tl- 201 was injected into both coronary arteries during angiography and images were acquired between 6 - and 24 -hour after injection. Reinjection imaging with 1 mCi of Tl- 201 was performed at 4 -hour after adenosine stress imaging with 3 mCi of Tl- 201. Images were interpreted according to 4 -grade visual scoring system (grade 0 - 3). Segments with <b>mild</b> <b>to</b> <b>moderated</b> uptake (≤grade 1), and upgraded more than one score with reinjection, and were defined as viable myocardium. Results: Image quality was poor in two cases with IC-I. Numbers of non-viable segments were 60 (23. 8 %) with IC-I, and 38 (15. 1 %) with Re-I, respectively. Overall agreement for perfusion grade per myocardial segment in each IC-I and Re-I was 76. 5 %. Overall agreement for viable segment between IC-I and Re-I was 90. 5 %. Only one out of 38 segments interpreted as non-viable with Re-I were interpretated as viable with IC-I. And 23 out of 214 segments interpreted as viable with Re-I were interpreted as non-viable with IC-I. Conclusion: Intracoronary Tl- 201 SPECT seemed to be not advantageous over stress-rest reinjection imaging in the assessment of myocardial viability, mainly due to lo...|$|R

5|$|Alcohol {{detoxification}} or 'detox' for alcoholics is {{an abrupt}} stop of alcohol drinking {{coupled with the}} substitution of drugs, such as benzodiazepines, that have similar effects to prevent alcohol withdrawal. Individuals who are only at risk of <b>mild</b> <b>to</b> <b>moderate</b> withdrawal symptoms can be detoxified as outpatients.

Detoxification does not actually treat alcoholism, and it is necessary to follow up detoxification with an appropriate treatment program for alcohol dependence or abuse to reduce the risk of relapse. Some symptoms of alcohol withdrawal such as depressed mood and anxiety typically take weeks or months to abate while other symptoms persist longer due to persisting neuroadaptations. Alcoholism has serious adverse effects on brain function; on average it takes one year of abstinence to recover from the cognitive deficits incurred by chronic alcohol abuse.|$|E

Unlike pepsinogen II and pepsinogen I to II ratio that were affected by the severity of inflammation and atrophy in corpus in all groups, pepsinogen I generally did not change. After eradication, subjects with high mononuclear infiltration in corpus had lower pepsinogen I (54 versus 77. 1 [*]μ/mL), higher pepsinogen II (9. 4 versus 6. 9 [*]μ/mL), and lower ratio (7. 9 versus 11. 6) than those without (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Patients with <b>moderate</b> <b>to</b> severe {{psoriasis}} are undertreated. To {{solve this}} persistent problem, the consensus programme {{was performed to}} define goals for treatment of plaque psoriasis with systemic therapy and to improve patient care. An expert consensus meeting and a collaborative Delphi procedure were carried out. Nineteen dermatologists from different European countries met for a face-to-face discussion and defined items through a four-round Delphi process. Severity of plaque psoriasis was graded into <b>mild</b> and <b>moderate</b> <b>to</b> severe disease. <b>Mild</b> disease was defined as body surface area (BSA) ≤ 10 and psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) ≤ 10 and dermatology life quality index (DLQI) ≤ 10 and <b>moderate</b> <b>to</b> severe psoriasis as (BSA > 10 or PASI > 10) and DLQI > 10. Special clinical situations may change <b>mild</b> psoriasis <b>to</b> <b>moderate</b> <b>to</b> severe including involvement of visible areas or severe nail involvement. For systemic therapy of plaque psoriasis two treatment phases were defined: (1) induction phase as the treatment period until week 16; however, {{depending on the type}} of drug and dose regimen used, this phase may be extended until week 24 and (2) maintenance phase for all drugs was defined as the treatment period after the induction phase. For the definition of treatment goals in plaque psoriasis, the change of PASI from baseline until the time of evaluation (ΔPASI) and the absolute DLQI were used. After induction and during maintenance therapy, treatment can be continued if reduction in PASI is ≥ 75 %. The treatment regimen should be modified if improvement of PASI is 5 but can be continued if the DLQI is > 5. This programme defines the severity of plaque psoriasis for the first time using a formal consensus of 19 European experts. In addition, treatment goals for <b>moderate</b> <b>to</b> severe disease were established.

40|$|St. John’s {{wort extract}} is {{composed}} {{of a large number}} of components, about 150, but the most studied and interesting substance are hyperforin and hypericin. The herb is very popular and it is known for its pharmacological efficacy in numerous disorders. It is used for treatment of <b>mild</b> <b>to</b> <b>moderated</b> depression as an alternative to synthetic antidepressants. The St. John’s wort products are available in several preparations, as tablets, capsules, tea, fresh plant juice etc. Hyperforin is the part of St. John’s wort that gives the antidepressant effect through inhibition of reuptake of neurotransmitters such norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, GABA and L-glutamate. Since 1999, several case reports and clinical studies have demonstrated the interactions of St. John’s wort extract with other medical products, resulting in a decreased plasma concentration and potential therapeutics failure. The mechanism behind this is an interaction between St. John’s wort with intestinal and hepatic cytochrome P 450 and P-glycoprotein, resulting in inducing these enzymes. In vitro investigations indicated that this induction is medicated by an interaction of hyperforin with the pregnane X receptor. Long-term co-medication of St. John’s wort extract reduces the bioavailability of wide variety of drugs, including digoxin, warfarin, cyclosporine, oral contraceptive and theophylline. The object of the present thesis was to investigate and describe the influence of St. John’s wort extract on the pharmacokinetics of the drugs mentioned above and what this pharmacokinetic interaction has for clinical consequences. Seven studies, with different numbers of participants, performed in different countries, were compiled to describe the effect of St. John’s wort on the drugs. The results from these studies showed that St. John’s wort extract affects the metabolism of these drugs by significant reducing theirs pharmacological effect. This decrease of the bioavailability and plasma concentration can be the results of intestinal and hepatic induction of CYP enzymes and p-glycoprotein. From these results I conclude that St. John’s wort should be used with caution and patients receiving these drugs should regularly monitory theirs plasma concentration...|$|R
