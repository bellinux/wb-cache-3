5|$|Over {{the course}} of time, a snowpack may settle under its own weight until its density is {{approximately}} 30% of water. Increases in density above this initial compression occur primarily by melting and refreezing, caused by temperatures above freezing or by direct solar radiation. In colder climates, snow lies on the ground all winter. By late spring, snow densities typically reach a maximum of 50% of water. Snow that persists into summer evolves into névé, granular snow, which has been partially melted, refrozen and compacted. Névé has a <b>minimum</b> <b>density</b> of , which is roughly half of the density of liquid water.|$|E

2500|$|Supermassive {{black holes}} have {{properties}} that distinguish them from lower-mass classifications. First, the average density of a SMBH (defined as {{the mass of}} the black hole divided by the volume within its Schwarzschild radius) can be less than the density of water in the case of some SMBHs. This is because the Schwarzschild radius is directly proportional to mass, while density is inversely proportional to the volume. Since the volume of a spherical object (such as the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole) is directly proportional to the cube of the radius, the <b>minimum</b> <b>density</b> of a black hole is inversely proportional to the square of the mass, and thus higher mass black holes have lower average density. In addition, the tidal forces {{in the vicinity of the}} event horizon are significantly weaker for massive black holes. As with density, the tidal force on a body at the event horizon is inversely proportional to the square of the mass: a person on the surface of the Earth and one at the event horizon of a 10 million [...] black hole experience about the same tidal force between their head and feet. Unlike with stellar mass black holes, one would not experience significant tidal force until very deep into the black hole.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Forage is a {{valuable}} commodity stored on dairy farms. Bunker and pile silos have increased in use due to increasing herd size. Losses in feed value in bunker and pile silos are frequently higher than they should be because producers are not packing them sufficiently to exclude oxygen during the storage and feed out periods. The objective {{of this paper was}} to consider the recommendation of a <b>minimum</b> packing <b>density</b> of 240 kg dry matter/m 3 compared to a <b>minimum</b> bulk <b>density</b> recommendation to keep porosity low. Our conclusions are that producers should try to achieve a <b>minimum</b> bulk <b>density</b> of 700 kg as fed/m 3 while harvesting forage in the recommended range of 30 - 40 % dry matter so as to limit porosity to a maximum of 0. 4. This should result in lower losses of forage dry matter (DM) over a range of DM contents than when following the recommendation of a <b>minimum</b> packing <b>density</b> of 240 kg DM/m 3...|$|R

50|$|Dimensional {{weight is}} a {{calculation}} of a theoretical {{weight of a}} package. This theoretical weight is {{the weight of the}} package at a <b>minimum</b> <b>density</b> chosen by the freight carrier. If the package is below this <b>minimum</b> <b>density,</b> then the actual weight is irrelevant as the freight carrier will charge for the volume of the package as if it were of the chosen density (what the package would weigh at the <b>minimum</b> <b>density).</b> Furthermore, the volume used to calculate the dimensional weight may not be absolutely representative of the true volume of the package. The freight carrier will measure the longest dimension {{in each of the three}} axis (X, Y, Z) and use these measurements to determine the package volume. If the package is a right-angled rectangular box (cuboid), then this will be equal to the true volume of the package. However, if the package is of any other shape, then the calculation of volume will be more than the true volume of the package.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we aim to}} {{investigate}} the implementation of contact angles in the pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann modeling of wetting at a large density ratio. The pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann model [X. Shan and H. Chen, Phys. Rev. E 49, 2941 (1994) ] is a popular mesoscopic model for simulating multiphase flows and interfacial dynamics. In this model, the contact angle is usually realized by a fluid-solid interaction. Two widely used fluid-solid interactions: the density-based interaction and the pseudopotential-based interaction, {{as well as a}} modified pseudopotential-based interaction formulated in the present paper, are numerically investigated and compared in terms of the achievable contact angles, the maximum and the <b>minimum</b> <b>densities,</b> and the spurious currents. It is found that the pseudopotential-based interaction works well for simulating small static (liquid) contact angles, however, is unable to reproduce static contact angles close to 180 degrees. Meanwhile, it is found that the proposed modified pseudopotential-based interaction performs better in light of the maximum and the <b>minimum</b> <b>densities</b> and is overall more suitable for simulating large contact angles as compared with the other two types of fluid-solid interactions. Furthermore, the spurious currents are found to be enlarged when the fluid-solid interaction force is introduced. Increasing the kinematic viscosity ratio between the vapor and liquid phases is shown to be capable of reducing the spurious currents caused by the fluid-solid interactions.

40|$|Urban {{planners}} now commonly {{advocate for}} increases in {{density of the}} built environment to reduce car dependence and enhance the sustainability of cities. The analysis in this paper asks about {{the speed at which}} density as a sustainability policy can be implemented. The Greater Toronto Hamilton Area (GTHA) is used as a case study to measure how quickly existing areas could be densified to meet <b>minimum</b> transit supportive <b>density</b> thresholds. Almost 70 % of existing residents live in neighborhoods with <b>densities</b> below <b>minimum</b> transit supportive <b>densities.</b> The findings show that increases in <b>minimum</b> <b>densities</b> could be attained roughly within the target time horizon of existing growth plans, but that these increases hinge on assumptions of continuing high growth rates. The sustainability of cities relies on a high ‘velocity of density’, a term proposed in the paper to refer to the speed at which density can be implemented. Density is often slowed or halted by local residents, which could prove problematic if sustainability objectives require speedy implementation, for instance to address climate change. Analysis of the velocity of density suggests that planning for sustainability, and climate change, in cities would benefit from considering a broader set of solutions to car dependence in existing low-density areas than changes to the density of the built form alone...|$|R
