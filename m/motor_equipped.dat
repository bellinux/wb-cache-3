50|$|Israel Aerospace Industries {{announced}} in June 2009, that the Arrow 3 patented exoatmospheric interception method includes a two-stage interceptor, like the Arrow 2, but purely based on hit-to-kill technology. Unlike most kill vehicles, which use liquid or gas propulsion, the new Israeli kill vehicle will be propelled by an ordinary rocket <b>motor</b> <b>equipped</b> with a thrust-vectoring nozzle. It {{will also be}} fitted with a gimbaled seeker for hemispheric coverage. By measuring the seeker's line-of-sight propagation relative to the vehicle's motion, the kill vehicle will use proportional navigation to divert its course and line up exactly with the target's flight path. Joseph Hasson, chief missile designer at IAI, who patented the new kill vehicle with his colleague Galya Goldner, says that the concept is relatively simple, reliable and inexpensive, {{and is based on}} mature technologies. Furthermore, the kill vehicle's divert capability and agility reduce the need for detection and tracking systems, which usually accompany remote sensor-assisted exoatmospheric kills. IAI displayed a full-sized model of the Arrow 3 missile and its kill vehicle at the June 2009 Paris Air Show.|$|E

40|$|In permanent-magnet motors {{used for}} vehicle {{traction}} application a well-known {{problem is the}} need to weaken the flux at high speeds.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} stability of a proportional-integral Luenberger observer, designated for the state variables reconstruction of a linear, time-invariant dynamical system. It is proven, that there exists such a class of observed systems, for which the observer is always unstable, independently of its gains. Stability can be provided in every possible case after application of proposed modifications {{to the structure of}} the observer. It is proven, that stability of the modified observer depends only on its gains. It is shown, that an induction motor is the exemplary observed system, for which application of the unmodified observer is impossible due to its lack of stability, while the modified observer provides proper operation of the control system. Finally, some experimental results are presented, obtained in the multiscalar control system of the induction <b>motor,</b> <b>equipped</b> with the modified proportional-integral observer.

The induced stress distribution in stator core is significantly different from that in land type motor. Its effect on the magnetic properties of stator core is important for deep-sea motor designers but seldom reported. In this paper, the stress distribution in stator core, regarding the seawater compressive stress, is calculated by 2 D finite element method (FEM). The effect of compressive stress on magnetic properties of electrical steel sheet, that is, permeability, BH curves, and BW curves, is also measured. Then, {{based on the measured}} magnetic properties and calculated stress distribution, the stator iron loss is estimated by stress-electromagnetics-coupling FEM. At last the estimation is verified by experiment. Both the calculated and measured results show that stator iron loss increases obviously with the seawater compressive stress...|$|E

40|$|Abstract 1 - The paper {{deals with}} the {{electromagnetic}} forces in induction machines when the rotor is performing eccentric mo-tion {{with respect to the}} stator. The studied eccentric motions of the rigid cage rotor are cylindrical circular whirling motion, symmetric conical whirling motion and the combination of these two basic modes of eccentric motions. The multi-slice, time stepping finite element analysis is used for solving the magnetic field, and the forces are calculated from the air gap by a method based on the principle of virtual work. The forces are measured for a test <b>motor</b> <b>equipped</b> with active magnetic bearings. The active magnetic bearings are used to generate the eccentric rotor motions and also to measure the electromagnetic forces. The measured and calculated forces show relatively good agreement. The results show that superpo-sition is valid when determining forces. This means that the cal-culated forces of different motions can be combined and the result is the force of the combined motion.

40|$|Abstract The {{total core}} loss in a claw-pole {{structure}} has been calculated {{on the basis}} of the variation of the magnetic loading over the magnetization cycle in different parts of the machine. This variation has been estimated from a lumped parameter permeance network and 3 D finite element simulations, studying the flux density waveform and loci in their elements. The results from the simulations are compared with the loss measurements in a single-phase claw-pole <b>motor</b> <b>equipped</b> with an outer permanent-magnet rotor. Results show that the static and dynamic losses are underestimated by 35 % and up to 60 % at 100 Hz respectively. Finally, the results from an optimization process are presented, where the torque performance is evaluated as a function of the pole number and dimensions of the machine.
