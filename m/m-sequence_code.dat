30|$|Spread {{spectrum}} technique spreads hidden data {{through the}} frequency spectrum. Spread spectrum (SS) {{is a concept}} developed in data communications to ensure a proper recovery of a signal sent over a noisy channel by producing redundant copies of the data signal. Basically, data are multiplied by an <b>M-sequence</b> <b>code</b> known to both sender and receiver[27], then hidden in the cover audio. Thus, if noise corrupts some values, {{there will still be}} copies of each value left to recover the hidden message. In[28], conventional direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) technique was applied to hide confidential information in MP 3 and WAV signals. However, to control stego-audio distortion,[22, 23] have proposed an embedding method where data are hidden under a frequency mask. In[22], spread spectrum is combined to phase shifting in order to increase the robustness of transmitted data against additive noise and to allow easy detection of the hidden data. For a better hiding rate,[23] used SS technique in the sub-band domain. Appropriately chosen sub-band coefficients were selected to address robustness and resolve synchronization uncertainty at the decoder.|$|E

We propose the reconfiguration scheme of composite signatures in which optical network codecs reconfigure their signature keys in a tractable way to enhance system confidentiality for coded wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) transmissions. Based on conventional maximal-length sequence (<b>M-sequence)</b> <b>codes</b> over arrayed-waveguide-grating (AWG) codecs, composite signatures of relative prime-length <b>M-sequence</b> <b>codes</b> are structured to identify network node users.

40|$|AbstractTo combat with multiple-users {{interference}} and malicious eavesdropping, {{this paper}} proposes a double scrambling scheme over time/wavelength for a cryptographic optical CDMA (OCDMA) data transmission. By using wavelength-spreading/time-hopping, data reliability in OCDMA network {{can be highly}} improved. On the transmitter side, data bits are sliced into spectral chips, <b>coded</b> into <b>M-sequence</b> <b>codes,</b> and conducted with different units of time-delay. In the receiver side, fiber-delay lines (FDLs) reverse the spectral chips {{back to the same}} time basis, and optical switches (OSWs) turn on-off spectral chips into balanced detector for the final data decoding. By changing signature code frequently, the eavesdroppers cannot catch on the changing code speed and have little chance to detect the channel waveform to solve the code. To against eavesdropping, we take advantages of linear cyclic, periodic, and nearly-orthogonal characteristics of <b>M-sequence</b> <b>codes.</b> OSWs and FDLs are added into the arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) codecs. The spectral codes and the time-delay units will follow cell states of a controlling shift register. Different shift register states will reconfigure AWG light spectra into different coding sequences.

When such a sequence attains this upper bound as its period, {{it is called}} a maximal period linear sequence, or m-sequence in short. Interest in such sequences originated from applications.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} in Multi-Access systems is the Multi-Access Interference (MAI) between signals that are sharing the same channel, specially, in the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) systems where all users share the same channel all the time. Multiuser Detection (MUD) deals with the demodulation {{of a number of}} mutually interfering digital streams of information transmitted over a shared channel. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are often used as a powerful tool in many applications in communication systems. The objective of this work is to develop a Multiuser Receiver for Wideband CDMA signals over fading media subject to MAI, particularly, for mobile communication systems, appropriate for the third generation and beyond, using ANNs. In phase one of this work, MUDs of WCDMA signals has been realized using ANNs. The uplink scenario of synchronous CDMA system is considered. The ANN is used after a bank of Rake receivers each is of four fingers. The output of the Rake receivers is used to train the network for different number of users. The model includes a Walsh encoder of order 6 for input data, and a multipath “frequency-selective” fading channel realized as a Rayleigh distribution of complex coefficients representing a wireless mobile time-varying channel. Paths are of different spans for each user generated as random integers. The PN <b>codes</b> generated are <b>m-sequence</b> <b>codes</b> and Gold codes. The Rake receivers use Equal Gain Combining (EGC). Three different types of ANNs with different learning algorithms have been employed, these are: the FeedForward (FF) NN with Backpropagation, the Radial Basis Function (RBF) NN, and Self-Organizing feature Map (SOM). Several other methods from theory were programmed and tested for comparison and appraisal purpose; such as conventional detector and Decorrelating receiver. vii Comparing results for the different types of NN MUDs, the FFNN MUDs gave better performance when trained properly, but their training is the main difficult issue and takes very long time. While RBF MUDs’ training is easy and fast, attention is needed to set the training parameters. On the other hand SOM MUDs don’t need any training since they are unsupervised NNs, but their implementation is not easy. RBF and SOM MUDs give lower performance compared to the FFNN MUDs. The average BERs of the FFNN MUDs are of order of 10 - 4 with small number of users, it is about 2 x 10 - 3 with large number of users, while with RBFNN, and SOMNN MUDs are lying in ranges between 1 x 10 - 4 and 3 x 10 - 3. In phase two in this work, ANNs are used as Muli-Access Interference (MAI) estimator after Rake reception, trained with transmitted interference generated from the cross correlation between codes, followed by Parallel Interference Canceller (PIC). Comparing results for the three different types of the neural networks-based MAI estimator and single stage PIC detector with <b>m-sequence</b> <b>codes,</b> one can observe that for small number of users the FFNN is the best among the three, while with large number of users, the SOMNN is the best. The SOMNN is an unsupervised neural network, and it better estimates the MAI from other users. In addition, it is stable and behaves almost the same with different number of users. The BER with the SOMNN MAI estimator ranged between 0. 0018 and 0. 0023. The RBFNN MAI estimator performance is close to that of the SOMNN, though lower in case {{of a large number of}} users. The BER with the RBFNN MAI estimator ranged between 0. 00125 and 0. 0032. The FFNN MAI estimator performs better with small number of users and with small number of neurons in HL, but its performance deteriorates with larger number of users. The BER with the FFNN MAI estimator with 30 -neurons is ranged between 0. 0 and 0. 0063. In addition, MAI estimator functioned better with <b>m-sequence</b> <b>codes</b> than with Gold codes.

These {{operations are}} performed at the PN coding stages in CDMA, Gold code generation stage in WCDMA and several operation stages in the mobile transmitter and receiver protocols in Software Defined Radios (SDRs). A kernel can instantiate several processing objects when processing in the processor. Use of the kernel is known to lead to reduced energy dissipation by reducing the need {{of just a few}} memory accesses. A kernel for the multi-bit output Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) operations is proposed in this paper. An Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) proposed for the kernel gives the functional instantiation at the stages of generation of PN long sequence, PNI short sequence and PNQ short sequence, <b>M-sequence,</b> Gold <b>code</b> sequence, CRC sequence and Signature sequence in the SDR link-applications, and other wireless applications.

40|$|This thesis tackles {{the issue}} of the rapid {{acquisition}} of spreading codes in Direct-Sequence Spread-Spectrum (DS/SS) communication systems. In particular, a new algorithm is proposed that exploits the experience of the iterative decoding of modern codes (LDPC and turbo codes) to detect these sequences. This new method is a Message-Passing-based algorithm. Specifically, instead of correlating the received signal with local replicas of the transmitted linear feedback shift register (LFSR) sequence, an iterative Message-Passing algorithm is implemented to be run on a loopy graph. In particular, these graphical models are designed by manipulating the generating polynomial structure of the considered LFSR sequence. Therefore, this contribution is a detailed analysis of the detection technique based on Message-Passing algorithms to acquire <b>m-Sequences</b> and Gold <b>codes.</b> More in detail, a unified treatment to design and implement a specific set of graphical models for these codes is reported.

40|$|In a {{synchronous}} DS-CDMA {{system the}} multi-user interference (MUI) caused by multipath propagation degrades the system performance. Although multiuser detection(MUD) {{is useful to}} remove this MUI, {{it is certainly not}} a practical solution for down-link transmission due to terminal design problems, and sub-optimal receivers such as RAKE receivers are used in the current DS-CDMA systems. Recently, as another approach, MUI-free schemes such as Suehiro 2 ̆ 7 s CDMA and chip-interleaved block spreading (CIBS) [...] CDMA，or block spread (BS) [...] CDMA，have been proposed because of less receiver complexity than the conventional MUD receivers. However, these schemes sufTer small user population, high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), and transmission power loss. 　　In this research, we propose ａ convolutional spreading CDMA scheme based on the use of cyclic prefix (CP) and the zero correlation zone (ZCZ) codes for synchronous downlink transmission. The scheme, called CS-CDMA/CP, can be considered as a rich class of MUI-free schemes including Suehiro 2 ̆ 7 s CDMA and BS-CDMA as special cases. Usage of ZCZ codes in CS-CDMA/CP enable us to over come denoted difficulties noted above and enjoys good user capacity, high bandwidth efficiency, and much more flexibility for implementation in ａ practical system. 　　Like Suehiro 2 ̆ 7 s CDMA and BS-CDMA, the use of ZCZ codes and CP in CS-CDMA/CP schemes completely eliminates the multipath induced MUI at the cost of the need forequalizers. Although only some special equalizers are considered in the previously known MUI-free schemes mentioned above, in this research we consider linear equalizers (LE), decision feed back equalizers (DFE) as well as maximum-likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) equalizer. We show, among these equalizers, minimum mean square-error de-cision feed back equalizer (MMSE=DFE) achieves a good trade-off between performance and complexity. In addition to these rather classical equalizers, we also try to utilize the eflectiveness of powerful turbo equalization. To this end, we combine CS-CDMA/CP with a forward error correcting (FEC) code and interleaving and proposed ａ new type of iterative (turbo) equalizer for CS-CDMA/CP. With this iterative equalizer, we can achieve better bit error rate (BER) performance with only ａ fewer number of iterations and enhanced path diversity gain over multipath fading channels. 　　Motivated by recent impressive development of space-time coding, we extend our single-antenna coded CS-CDMA/CP scheme to a new space-time CDMA scheme of space-time spreading (STS) type, the space-code CS-CDMA/CP with iterative decoding. With this scheme, the multiuser multiple-antenna system is transformed to ａ single-user, single-antenna system. We show, by simulation, that the proposed system achieves full path and antenna diversity over a quasi-static channel and shows considerable performance improvement over a block fading channel with only ａ single-user receiver complexity. 　　Apart from the BER performance that is dependent on the particular equalizer em-ployed, some important characteristics of CS-CDMA/CP are dependant on the employed ZCZ codes, such as the user population and PAPR in transmit signal sequence. Generally, ternary ZCZ (± 1, 0) codes allow doubled user population compared to binry ZCZ (± 1) codes but yield high PAPR, which necessitates a high costly transmitter ampli-fier. To over come these difficulties, we introduce a periodic ZCZ code generated from an <b>M-sequence,</b> M-ZCZ <b>code,</b> for CS-CDMA/CP. The M-ZCZ code provides the same user capacity as ternary ZCZ code and allows more design flexibility and shows stronger robustness against an imperfect transmitter amplifier. 　　CS-CDMA/CP guarantees MUI-free transmission whenever the data length D, multi-path channel length L, and the ZCZ length Z satisfy the constraint Z D+L- 1. How-ever, for a multipath channel with longer delay spread of length L_e_＞L, CS-CDMA/CP sufTers from MUI. The correlation properties outside the ZCZ are not well understood for the previously known ZCZ codes. With M-ZCZ codes, we can derive the exact form of this MUI and can introduce MUI-cancellation methods for Z＜D+L_e_- 1. Compared to the BER performance of fully MUI-free CS-CDMA/CP schemes, M-ZCZ codes with proposed MUI cancellation methods show only a slight degradation and hence we cansupport more user population (hence high bandwidth emciency) over multipath channels with a graceful performance degradation. 　　From above results, we conclude CS-CDMA/CP is a practical and eflective for use in a future CDMA system. 電気通信大学 200...|$|R
40|$|Optical Code Division Multiple Access (OCDMA) {{is capable}} of {{providing}} future local area networks with higher connectivity, asynchronous multiple access and flexible bandwidth management. Much of the increased activity in this area has resulted from improvements in Fibre Bragg grating (FBG) fabrication technology driven mainly by the stringent requirements of DWDM. It is now possible to design and reliably fabricate superstructured fibre Bragg gratings (SSFBGs) with truly complex amplitude and phase responses [1], opening {{the possibility of using}} SSFBG components to perform fundamental OCDMA functions such as the coding and decoding of chip patterns described herein. In earlier work we demonstrated the generation of seven-chip, direct sequence, unipolar (amplitude) code OCDMA bits at 125 MHz using a SSFBG, and demonstrated optical pattern recognition using a matched SSFBG filter as a decoder [2]. In this paper we present results on upgrading the SSFBG approach to both far higher data rates (10 Gbit/s) and far shorter chip-lengths (6. 4 ps) with far higher grating reflectivity (up to 50 %) than previously demonstrated by fabricating bipolar (phase) coding and decoding SSFBGs using our continuous scanning technique. We present the results of BER measurements at 10 GBit/s on a decoded pulse sequence both before and after transmission through 25 km of standard fibre which show there to be no noise-penalty associated with the either the coding:decoding process, or due to transmission of the coded pulse itself. Our experimental set-up is shown in Fig. 1 a and comprises a 10 Gbit/s, ~ 2 ps pulse transmitter (based on a regeneratively mode-locked, soliton fibre ring laser operating at 10 GHz), bipolar coding and decoding gratings, and an (optional) 25 km standard fibre transmission span which had its dispersion compensated with a chirped FBG. We fabricated seven-chip <b>M-sequence,</b> bipolar <b>coding</b> and decoding gratings. The total grating length in each instance was 4. 64 mm (corresponding to a temporal code length of 44. 8 µs) and the individual chip width was 0. 66 mm (corresponding to a chip length of 6. 4 ps). The bipolar grating design is shown inset in Fig. 1 a, and is a pure phase-encoded structure with discrete n phase shifts at the (NRZ) chip transition boundaries. The experimental and theoretical plots are shown in Fig. lb. The agreement between the theoretical and experimental spectral responses of the bipolar SSFBG is seen to be excellent, highlighting the precision of our grating writing process. The decoder grating is essentially identical to the encoder grating other than it has a spatially-reversed refractive index superstructure. Note that all of gratings used in these experiments (including the dispersion compensating FBG) were written by appropriate W exposure through the same, uniform period phase mask. Since the SSFBGs are relatively weak and within the Fourier theory grating design limit, the impulse response of the grating in the time domain is given by the superstructure modulation profile used to write the grating. We examined the intensity autocorrelation functions of the incident 2 ps pulses on reflection from the individual coding:decoding gratings, and found the profiles to be in excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions as shown in Fig. 2 a. This includes the decoder response to the code after it has propagated over the 25 km dispersion-compensated transmission line, there is evidence of some correlation signal degradation, however the effects are slight, and in fact negligible in terms of overall system performance. The spectral response of the decoded signal is also compared to the theoretical plot as shown inset in Fig 2 a. BER measurements were taken on the code:decode process, both with and without the 25 km transmission. The results are summarised in Fig. 2 b where it is seen that no power penalty associated with code-decode process is observed in either instance. Eye diagrams for both the simple code:decode and transmitted code:decode case are shown inset within Fig. 2 b. No evidence of temporal features away from the main, chip-length long, correlation peak is observed as expected. In conclusion we have demonstrated high-quality, 10 Gbit/s bipolar OCDMA coding and decoding using superstructured FBGs with a code chip rate of 160 Gbit/s. Error-free operation with no power penalty was obtained for the coding:decoding process after propagation of the code through 25 km of fibre. These results highlight the precision and flexibility of our particular grating writing process and point to further applications of SSFBGs in future high-speed optical networks. For example our results demonstrate the possibility of using SSFBGs for header recognition in 160 Gbit/s OTDM based networks. Fig 1 (a) Experimental set up.
