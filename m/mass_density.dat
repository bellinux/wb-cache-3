5|$|A {{hierarchical}} structure of matter began to form from minute {{variations in the}} <b>mass</b> <b>density</b> of space. Matter accumulated in the densest regions, forming clouds of gas and the earliest stars, the Population III stars. These massive stars triggered the reionization process and {{are believed to have}} created many of the heavy elements in the early Universe, which, through nuclear decay, create lighter elements, allowing the cycle of nucleosynthesis to continue longer.|$|E
5|$|Before {{observations}} of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios {{for the future}} of the universe. If the <b>mass</b> <b>density</b> of the universe were greater than the critical density, then the universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state similar to that in which it started—a Big Crunch.|$|E
5|$|The more matter {{there is}} in the Universe, the {{stronger}} the mutual gravitational pull of the matter. If the Universe were too dense then it would re-collapse into a gravitational singularity. However, if the Universe contained too little matter then the expansion would accelerate too rapidly for planets and planetary systems to form. Since the Big Bang, the universe has expanded monotonically. Perhaps unsurprisingly, our universe has just the right <b>mass</b> <b>density</b> of about 5 protons per cubic meter which has allowed it to expand for the last 13.8 billion years, giving time to form the universe as observed today.|$|E

5|$|Mimas, the {{innermost}} {{of the round}} moons of Saturn and directly interior to Enceladus, is a geologically dead body, even though it should experience stronger tidal forces than Enceladus. This apparent paradox can be explained in part by temperature-dependent properties of water ice (the main constituent of the interiors of Mimas and Enceladus). The tidal heating per unit mass is given by the formula , where ρ is the (<b>mass)</b> <b>density</b> of the satellite, n is its mean orbital motion, r is the satellite's radius, e is the orbital eccentricity of the satellite, μ is the shear modulus and Q is the dimensionless dissipation factor. For a same-temperature approximation, the expected value of qtid for Mimas is about 40 times that of Enceladus. However, the material parameters μ and Q are temperature dependent. At high temperatures (close to the melting point), μ and Q are low, so tidal heating is high. Modeling suggests that for Enceladus, both a 'basic' low-energy thermal state with little internal temperature gradient, and an 'excited' high-energy thermal state with a significant temperature gradient, and consequent convection (endogenic geologic activity), once established, would be stable. For Mimas, only a low-energy state {{is expected to be}} stable, despite its being closer to Saturn. So the model predicts a low-internal-temperature state for Mimas (values of μ and Q are high) but a possible higher-temperature state for Enceladus (values of μ and Q are low). Additional historical information is needed to explain how Enceladus first entered the high-energy state (e.g. more radiogenic heating or a more eccentric orbit in the past).|$|E
5|$|The {{migration}} {{of the outer}} planets is also necessary {{to account for the}} existence and properties of the Solar System's outermost regions. Beyond Neptune, the Solar System continues into the Kuiper belt, the scattered disc, and the Oort cloud, three sparse populations of small icy bodies thought to be the points of origin for most observed comets. At their distance from the Sun, accretion was too slow to allow planets to form before the solar nebula dispersed, and thus the initial disc lacked enough <b>mass</b> <b>density</b> to consolidate into a planet. The Kuiper belt lies between 30 and 55AU from the Sun, while the farther scattered disc extends to over 100AU, and the distant Oort cloud begins at about 50,000AU. Originally, however, the Kuiper belt was much denser and closer to the Sun, with an outer edge at approximately 30AU. Its inner edge would have been just beyond the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, which were in turn far closer to the Sun when they formed (most likely in the range of 15–20AU), and in 50% of simulations ended up opposite locations, with Uranus farther from the Sun than Neptune.|$|E

40|$|Nullification of the Einstein tensor {{curvature}} for {{the elementary}} material space with active gravitational field (radial source) and passive field distribution of its inertial particle (radial sink) maintains the conceptual equivalence of collinear active and passive energy-momentum densities of the nonlocal energy-matter carrier in General Relativity (GR). The Ricci scalar curvature in the Lagrangian for electron's material space {{is related to}} active and passive real <b>mass</b> <b>densities</b> with residual positive energy, while electromagnetic (EM) active and passive imaginary <b>mass</b> <b>densities</b> produce a traceless energy density. One four-potential in geometrical sink-source identities universally forms gravitational and electromagnetic fields of the complex mass current. EM vector equalities balance anti-collinear four flows of active and passive imaginary masses (called electric charges). Similar GR vector equalities take into account twin coupling of inseparable unlike <b>mass</b> <b>densities</b> existing due to the forth-coordinate symmetry, dt = |± idx^ 4 /c|, in the Minkowski four-interval. Two equal pseudo-coordinates ± ix^o≡± x^ 4 serve for equal unlike masses of the same inertial body that results in collinear active and passive four-currents of real masses with net energy-momentum for collisions and measurements. Couples of unlike twin masses can simultaneously radiate-absorb paired vector waves with zero-balanced Poynting flows for real-time observations in the two-body gravitational system.

25|$|The above {{equations}} suggest {{there is}} a flow speed at which pressure is zero, and at even higher speeds the pressure is negative. Most often, gases and liquids are not capable of negative absolute pressure, or even zero pressure, so clearly Bernoulli's equation ceases to be valid before zero pressure is reached. In liquids – when the pressure becomes too low – cavitation occurs. The above equations use a linear relationship between flow speed squared and pressure. At higher flow speeds in gases, or for sound waves in liquid, the changes in <b>mass</b> <b>density</b> become significant so that the assumption of constant density is invalid.|$|E
25|$|Like others before, Poincaré (1900) {{discovered}} a relation between mass and electromagnetic energy. While studying {{the conflict between}} the action/reaction principle and Lorentz ether theory, he tried to determine whether the center of gravity still moves with a uniform velocity when electromagnetic fields are included. He noticed that the action/reaction principle does not hold for matter alone, but that the electromagnetic field has its own momentum. Poincaré concluded that the electromagnetic field energy of an electromagnetic wave behaves like a fictitious fluid (fluide fictif) with a <b>mass</b> <b>density</b> of E/c2. If the center of mass frame is defined by both the mass of matter and the mass of the fictitious fluid, and if the fictitious fluid is indestructible—it's neither created or destroyed—then the motion of the center of mass frame remains uniform. But electromagnetic energy can be converted into other forms of energy. So Poincaré assumed that there exists a non-electric energy fluid at each point of space, into which electromagnetic energy can be transformed and which also carries a mass proportional to the energy. In this way, the motion of the center of mass remains uniform. Poincaré said that one should not be too surprised by these assumptions, since they are only mathematical fictions.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{construction}} industry in South Africa and worldwide generates {{a disproportionate number}} of fatalities, injuries and is associated with disease, the direct and indirect cost of which contributes to the cumulative cost of construction. Many injuries are musculoskeletal related in the form of sprains and strains arising from the handling of materials, which process is managed by, inter alia, civil engineers. Furthermore, civil engineers as designers influence construction ergonomics through the specification of materials and the related methods. The purpose of the paper is to present the results of a study conducted among civil engineering students in a South African university, the objectives being to determine their knowledge and perceptions relative to the <b>mass</b> and <b>density</b> of materials and construction ergonomics. The following constitute the salient results: knowledge relative to the <b>mass</b> and <b>density</b> of materials is limited; students appreciate that the <b>mass</b> and <b>density</b> of materials impacts on construction ergonomics; students rate their knowledge of the <b>mass</b> and <b>density</b> of materials as limited as opposed to extensive, and students appreciate the potential of the consideration of the <b>mass</b> and <b>density</b> of materials to contribute to an improvement in construction ergonomics.
