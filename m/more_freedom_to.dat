5|$|Two {{external}} factors had their impacts on Verdi's compositions of this period. One {{is that with}} increasing reputation and financial security he no longer needed to commit himself to the productive treadmill, had <b>more</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> choose his own subjects, and {{had more time to}} develop them according to his own ideas. In the years 1849 to 1859 he wrote eight new operas, compared with fourteen in the previous ten years.|$|E
5|$|The plague {{was carried}} by fleas on sailing vessels {{returning}} from the ports of Asia, spreading quickly {{due to lack of}} proper sanitation: the population of England, then about 4.2 million, lost 1.4 million people to the bubonic plague. Florence's population was nearly halved in the year 1347. As a result of the decimation in the populace the value of the working class increased, and commoners came to enjoy <b>more</b> <b>freedom.</b> <b>To</b> answer the increased need for labor, workers traveled in search of the most favorable position economically.|$|E

5|$|Davis was 47 {{years old}} when he was asked to play Carnegie Hall in 1974, which {{followed}} four years of relentless touring. He had played the venue numerous times before and recorded a live album there in 1961. By 1974, Davis had been dealing with depression, cocaine and sex addictions, and several health problems, including osteoarthritis, bursitis, and sickle-cell anemia. He had also lost respect with both critics and his contemporaries because of his musical explorations into more rock- and funk-oriented sounds. Influenced by Karlheinz Stockhausen, Davis wanted to avoid individual songs and instead record extended movements that developed into a different composition. He played his trumpet sparsely and became less of the focal point for his band, whom he allowed <b>more</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> improvise and with whom he rarely rehearsed, so that the young musicians he enlisted would be tested to learn and play together onstage.|$|E
5|$|Like its {{predecessor}} Metro 2033, Metro: Last Light is played {{from the perspective}} of Artyom, the player-character. The story takes place in post-apocalyptic Moscow, mostly inside the metro system, but occasionally missions bring the player above ground. Combat alternates between the player fighting mutants and hostile humans. Areas are larger in Last Light compared to 2033, and the game encourages exploration by having multiple routes. The game offers <b>more</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> players, allowing them to utilize different tactics to combat enemies. It features destructible environments, in which certain objects, such as pillars, collapse after being shot. Numerous diary entries, written by Artyom, providing additional insight regarding the game's story, are scattered throughout environments for players to collect.|$|E
5|$|The next {{significant}} role {{is played by}} the charity trustees, defined in Section 97 of the 1993 Act as those persons having the general control {{and management of the}} administration of charities. As mentioned, charitable trustees have significantly <b>more</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> act than normal trustees, but the 1993 Act has put restrictions on who may be a charitable trustee. Section 72 excludes people convicted of a crime involving dishonesty, bankrupts, people previously removed from charity trusteeship, and people struck off as directors of companies. Those trustees appointed have many duties when administering the trust, including informing the Commission of changes to the charity or its dissolution, registering the charity and keeping proper accounts and records, to be submitted annually to the Commission.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{its strong}} sales, Final Fantasy XIII had been criticized on several fronts. Complaints {{included}} {{that the game}} had been too linear, had not allowed enough interaction with non-player characters, and had not featured enough minigames and puzzles. The developers intended to address these criticisms with the sequel by adding the Historia Crux system, numerous sidequests from non-player characters, and the casino minigame area. Environments were made more explorable and the artists were given <b>more</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> include their own ideas in the game's locations, in order to rectify the shortcomings of the more artificial seeming settings in Final Fantasy XIII. Although the developers were explicitly responding to the criticism, they saw the changes and additions as making the sequel {{in line with what}} players had hoped Final Fantasy XIII would be, rather than backing away from the changes that game had brought to the series. For the structure of side quests and some other aspects such as the abundance of chocobos and the more open environment, the team drew inspiration from Rockstar San Diego's Red Dead Redemption. The game also included multiple endings, which Toriyama referred to as a first for the series.|$|E
5|$|EarthBound, {{known in}} Japan as , is a {{role-playing}} video game published by Nintendo for the Super NES video game console in 1994. Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka reprised their roles from Mother as composers for the game, and {{were joined by}} assistant composers Hiroshi Kanazu and Toshiyuki Ueno. In an interview with Weekly Famitsu, Keiichi Suzuki commented on how the SNES gave the composers much <b>more</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> compose what they wanted than the NES, which made development of the music for EarthBound much easier than for its predecessor. This freedom was partially {{a result of the}} larger memory space available, because one of the many problems the composers had in the first game was trying to get all of their music on to the cartridge. Another advantage was that the SNES could support playing eight notes at the same time, which when combined with the increased sound quality meant that he could compose music for the game in a similar fashion to how he would compose music for real life. Suzuki cited John Lennon as an influential figure to all the composers while the soundtrack was being developed, as his songs about love matched up with the feeling of the game. Critics and players have noted similarities between parts of some songs in the game to popular songs, including several suspected homages to songs by Lennon and The Beatles. Legal issues surrounding these similarities were suspected to prevent the game from being released on the Virtual Console outside of Japan, but the rumors were ultimately proved untrue.|$|E
5|$|Hatoful Boyfriend is {{the first}} game {{developed}} by manga artist and writer Hato Moa—author of the series Vairocana and a former Dengeki Comic Grand Prix honoree—under her dōjin circle PigeoNation Inc. As she had no experience with game development prior to Hatoful, Hato initially wanted {{to start with a}} visual novel, as she believed it was an easier game type for amateur developers to make; the format also allowed visuals to easily accompany her stories, something that she, as a manga artist, was accustomed to and viewed as being necessary in her work. She first came up with the concept for Hatoful as a 2011 April Fools' Day joke: despite her lack of familiarity with the genre, she initially intended to create a parody of otome game stereotypes. Birds in particular were used as a theme due to Hato's fondness for pigeons; however, this was also partially due to Hato's prioritization of writing over illustrating, as the use of bird photographs instead of hand-drawn sprites allowed her <b>more</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> focus on the script. The first incarnation of the game was created over the course of half a day and posted as a browser game made with Adobe Flash; but due to strong word of mouth from social media it was taken down after immense traffic caused the web server it was hosted on to crash on two separate occasions. Following the unexpected popularity of the Flash game, development began on a longer visual novel using the FamousWriter game engine.|$|E
50|$|Despite its short {{reign of}} power and {{implementation}} shortcomings, the Provisional Government passed very progressive legislation. The policies enacted by this moderate government (by 1917 Russian standards) represented arguably the most liberal legislation in Europe at the time. The independence of Church from state, the emphasis on rural self governance, and the affirmation of fundamental civil rights (such as freedom of speech, press, and assembly) that the tsarist government had periodically restricted shows the progressivism of the Provisional Government. Other policies included the abolition of capital punishment and economic redistribution in the countryside. The Provisional Government also granted <b>more</b> <b>freedoms</b> <b>to</b> previously suppressed regions of the Russian Empire. Poland was granted independence and Lithuania and Ukraine became more autonomous.|$|R

5|$|In {{response}} the Liberal Party launched Women's Liberal Associations {{which allowed}} women <b>more</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> allocate a role and voice {{for themselves and}} were not a mere subsidiary of the national party. The organisation {{of women in the}} Liberal Party in Wales began around 1890 supported by prominent members Gwyneth Vaughan, Nora Phillips and Sybil Thomas. In 1891 an Aberdare branch of the Women's Liberal Foundation was founded and it quickly began advocating votes for women and began leafleting in both English and Welsh. By 1893 there were said to be 7,000 members of the Welsh Union of Women's Liberal Associations which had raised to 9,000 by 1895. At a meeting of the North Wales Liberal Foundation in 1895 it was decided that Women's Liberal Federation would merge with Cymru Fydd, a political pressure group for home rule, to form a new Welsh Liberal Federation and equal rights for women were written into the objects of the organisation. Despite some early successes Liberal organisation floundered as they headed into the new century and apart from the Cardiff branch which achieved some successes, many of the branches had closed by 1907.|$|E
5|$|Structurally, the late-18th century Bastille was not greatly {{changed from}} its 14th-century predecessor. The eight stone towers had {{gradually}} acquired individual names: {{running from the}} north-east side of the external gate, these were La Chapelle, Trésor, Comté, Bazinière, Bertaudière, Liberté, Puits and Coin. La Chapelle contained the Bastille's chapel, decorated with a painting of Saint Peter in chains. Trésor took {{its name from the}} reign of Henry IV, when it had contained the royal treasury. The origins of the name of Comté tower are unclear; one theory is that the name refers to the County of Paris. Bazinière was named after Bertrand de La Bazinière, a royal treasurer who was imprisoned there in 1663. Bertaudière was named after a medieval mason who died building the structure in the 14th century. Liberté tower took its name either from a protest in 1380, when Parisians shouted the phrase outside the castle, or because it was used to house prisoners who had <b>more</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> walk around the castle than the typical prisoner. Puits tower contained the castle well, while Coin formed the corner of the Rue Saint-Antoine.|$|E
5|$|Creative Assembly's studio director, Tim Heaton, {{explained}} that Halo Wars 2 would not feature gameplay {{similar to their}} Total War series. Instead they wanted to build upon the foundation established with Halo Wars. With Halo Wars 2, the development team hoped to introduce new players to the strategy game genre while appeasing experienced players by including a range of multiplayer modes that {{a wide spectrum of}} players could enjoy. They also wanted to extend the purpose of leader units and their abilities by giving each of them a more defining role in the style of play they represent. Creative Assembly thought that the game needed more units capable of performing long range attacks. They wanted to add more artillery pieces, however they found that there were currently no suitable vehicles in the Halo universe. To remedy this, they created two new vehicles, the Kodiak and the Blisterback, to fit the role. They used reference material supplied by 343 Industries to ensure the new vehicles did not feel out of place. Halo Wars 2s creative director, Alistair Hope, noted that staying true to the source material was important aspect for all of Creative Assembly's games, but stated that the team were given <b>more</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> explore and expand the Halo universe than they had anticipated. Hope praised the control scheme used in Halo Wars and aimed to enhance the system by ensuring that Halo Wars 2 would be intuitive to play on a console. One common control feature included in many PC RTS games but absent from the original Halo Wars is control groups, which enables sets of units to be manually assigned to a key. As Halo Wars 2 was developed for console and PC, the designers were keen to include the feature for both versions of the game. 343 Industries had initially considered supporting cross-platform play between Windows and Xbox One devices, but the feature was ultimately excluded from the game at launch.|$|E

5|$|The {{localization}} of Path of Radiance {{was handled}} by Nintendo of America's localization branch Nintendo Treehouse. During the process, the team {{worked closely with}} Intelligent Systems staff members. The biggest challenge for the team was translating from Japanese to English, which required staff from Japan {{to come over and}} check their work. When translating the dialogue, the localization team wanted to preserve the story's depth and serious tone, despite often having a limited text and character space for interaction and expression. While they had the option to add extra text boxes, this would potentially have made going through conversations tedious for players, so they worked to match the number of text boxes used in the Japanese version. The western version's difficulty was also toned down: the Japanese version's Maniac setting was removed, Hard Mode was toned down, and a new Easy was introduced. These adjustments were based on both western test player feedback, and feedback from Japanese players complaining about the game's high difficulty. The amount of dialogue and text that needed translating was estimated at less than that in Animal Crossing, but still enough to take several months to complete. Due to its serious nature, the team needed to take a different approach to its localization than other Nintendo titles. As far as possible, the team remained faithful to the original script, aside from pieces like jokes which would not have made sense to people unfamiliar with Japanese humor. While {{most of the time they}} refrained from putting out-of-context remarks in character dialogue, an exception was Anna, a recurring Fire Emblem character who featured in optional tutorial missions. As she existed outside the game to a degree, they had <b>more</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> have her make pop culture references.|$|E
