5000|$|In United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 353 U.S. 586 (1957), the Court {{found that}} du Pont's {{acquisition}} {{of stock in}} GM had become unlawful because of its resulting control by du Pont of GM's automotive finish and fabric purchases (about half of the automobile industry's requirements)—with the consequence [...] "that du Pont purposely employed its stock to pry open the General Motors market to entrench itself as the primary supplier of General Motors' requirements for automotive finishes and fabrics. In deciding whether a violation was shown, the Court instructed that"in order to establish a violation of § 7, the Government must prove a likelihood that competition may be 'foreclosed in a substantial share of'&#8239" [...] the relevant market. That GM represented about half of that market satisfied the Standard Stations case's test of likelihood of competitive harm, and therefore there was sufficient <b>market</b> <b>foreclosure</b> to allow the inference of injury to competition.

[...] Accordingly, the district court was mistaken in concluding that Dentsply lacked the power to exclude competitors from the laboratories, [...] "the ultimate consumers," [...] that incorporated the teeth into dentures and similar products that dentists provided to patients; and by the same token the district court was clearly wrong to say Dentsply did not engage in <b>market</b> <b>foreclosure</b> because other manufacturers could just sell to the laboratories directly. Although some sales were made by manufacturers to the laboratories, overwhelming numbers were made to dealers, who then sold to the laboratories. [...] "The evidence in this case demonstrates that for a considerable time, through the use of Dealer Criterion 6, Dentsply has been able to exclude competitors from the dealers' network, a narrow, but heavily traveled channel to the dental laboratories."

If one believes that Pareto-dominated equilibria are unlikely to arise, then the difference between our results and those of Mathewson and Winter (1987), who do not allow for nonlinear pricing, suggests an ironic twist {{on the notion that}} quantity dis-counts and other kinds of nonlinear pricing can provide an additional way for a manufacturer to foreclose a rival.

In our study, we use the responses of the different market parties to identify how incumbents seek to foreclose the market for VoIP telephony. From these responses we conclude that foreclosure is not only attempted by setting high prices for the use of infrastructure, but also by the strategic choice of infrastructure technology, which raises the cost of entry. We label the latter form of foreclosure 2 ̆ 2 technological foreclosure 2 ̆ 2 – as opposed to 2 ̆ 2 <b>market</b> <b>foreclosure</b> 2 ̆ 2. A simple modeling exercise shows that regulators seeking to avoid <b>market</b> <b>foreclosure</b> might trigger technological foreclosure.

We conclude that the current rights and obligations assigned to telecom companies effectively protect incumbents from competition by VoIP entrants. Moreover, the inaction of regulatory authorities when it comes to numbering and communication protocols is advantageous for incumbents and might obstruct the provision of new services in the future...|$|E
40|$|After {{a number}} of warning signs, the U. S. "subprime {{mortgage}} crisis" became a headline issue in February 2007.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that vertically integrated firms {{have an incentive}} to foreclose the input <b>market</b> because <b>foreclosure</b> raises its downstream rivals' costs is the subject of much controversy in the theoretical industrial organization literature. A powerful argument against this hypothesis is that, absent commitment, such foreclosure cannot occur in Nash equilibrium. The laboratory data reported in this paper provide experimental evidence in favor of the hypothesis. Markets with a vertically integrated firm are signifiantly less competitive than those where firms are separate. While the experimental results violate the standard equilibrium notion, they are consistent with the quantalresponse generalization of Nash equilibrium.

40|$|It {{is known}} in {{regulatory}} economics the incentive that a vertically integrated company in the telecommunications sector, owning a local and a long distance network, has to deny (or charge a very high price for) interconnecting competitors in the long distance market in its local loop bottleneck or even supply a poor interconnection quality. This occurred in the US telecommunications market, given the dependence of the new long distance competitors (MCI and Sprint) on the AT&T local networks to connect with end users. Aiming to avoid these problems and introduce competition {{at least in the}} long distance segment, the telecom reform in Brazil followed closely the US antitrust experience in the AT&T divestiture of 1984, reducing the previous verticalization of the state-owned company TELEBRAS before privatization.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{and tests}} {{a model of}} the relation between the volatility of the exchange rate, default rates, the level of interest rates on loans, and the availability of credit, laying emphasis on frictions in the financial <b>market,</b> specifically <b>foreclosure</b> costs to collecting bad debts. On the assumption that foreign sources of funds are crucial for domestic finance, the paper tests the hypothesis of a high positive relation between the volatility of the exchange rate and the lending rate, and between the volatility of the exchange rate and capital inflows, on a sample of 54 countries over 1980 - 2000. The paper finds that exchange-rate and macroeconomic volatility are strong predictors of capital inflows (but not of lending rates) and that there may be an important role for financial frictions in the transmission process. Moreover, the paper finds that episodes of disinflation that rely on a reduction of the rate of depreciation tend to be accompanied by lower exchange rate volatility (in addition to simply lower rates of devaluation). Both effects, but principally the latter through financial frictions, suggest a solution to the lack of connection between the theory and the stylized facts of exchange rate-based stabilizations: ERBS programs may lead to initial booms through should cause a significant rise in the availability of credit, even if the cost of credit does not fall by much. interest rates, exchange rate volatility, financial frictions, creditor rights, exchange rate based stabilization...|$|R

This research chooses Broward County to explore whether socioeconomic characteristics and certain public policy instruments relate to subprime lending and mortgage foreclosure patterns. Results indicate areas bounded by linear highways and railroads have a concentration of low-income black population and subprime loans. The spatial distribution of subprime loans is mostly explained by a higher percentage of minority and/or Hispanic population in a neighborhood. Yet, racial minorities, instead of Hispanic origin, contributes mostly to the concentration of subprime loans. The spatial pattern of foreclosures is more complex, determined not only by subprime loans but also possibly other factors associated with the mortgage crisis. This suggests that disadvantaged neighborhoods are disproportionally lacking favorable opportunities due to institutional and sub- cultural forces shaping the geography of subprime and foreclosure...|$|R
