60|$|She got her hat and {{crossing}} a street {{they reached a}} long granite wall that ran out to sea. The languid swell beat against the massive, dovetailed blocks, the moon was rising above the gray hills, and when they had passed the landing place there was nobody about. By-and-by Chisholm indicated a <b>mooring</b> <b>post</b> and, when Flora sat down, leaned against the granite parapet.|$|E
60|$|The {{falling tide}} had {{deposited}} there {{the body of}} Abel Behenna stark upon the broken rocks. The rope trailing from its waist had been twisted by the current round the <b>mooring</b> <b>post,</b> and had held it back whilst the tide had ebbed away from it. The right elbow had fallen in a chink in the rock, leaving the hand outstretched toward Sarah, with the open palm upward {{as though it were}} extended to receive hers, the pale drooping fingers open to the clasp.|$|E
50|$|Wright's design {{went through}} various iterations, {{but the main}} feature was a ziggurat-like {{circular}} structure {{at the pinnacle of}} the mountain. The structure was wrapped in a spiraling ramp which cars would use to ascend and descend. The ramp was the main exterior feature of the structure, aside from a tall spire sticking up from the center, which was likely intended as a <b>mooring</b> <b>post</b> for dirigibles. Parking for hundreds of cars was placed inside the building.|$|E
50|$|The 1914 OS {{map shows}} {{for the first}} time a number of <b>mooring</b> <b>posts</b> running along the {{northern}} bank of the canal towards Lock 37 from Ferrydyke bascule bridge that were still present in 1937.|$|R
2500|$|Venetian Pool, {{opened in}} 1924 as [...] "Venetian Casino," [...] was created from a [...] old coral rock quarry, {{abandoned}} in 1921. The pool {{was founded by}} George Merrick {{as part of the}} development of Coral Gables, which was created in Mediterranean Revival style and utilized a large amount of coral for ornamental features of the community. The remaining quarry was reconfigured by architect Phineas Paist and designed by artist Denman Fink. Named for Mediterranean city of Venice, Italy, the pool included a Venetian style bridge and classic <b>mooring</b> <b>posts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|An {{impressive}} {{series of}} boat Nausts {{have been identified}} in the North Mallmhuir. A total of 15 definite and one possible nausts are ranged along 115m of shoreline on the south shore of this long narrow inlet. Associated with them are four jetties, numerous <b>mooring</b> <b>posts</b> and a series of ballast dumps. Known locally as 'cloches', they provided safe moorings for the island's fleet of punts, púcáns and bad mórs. A preliminary survey of the nausts was completed in Spring 2010, details of which have been published in Archaeology Ireland. [...] The numbers, scale and layout of the nausts are unparalleled elsewhere in Ireland, making them a unique maritime heritage monument.|$|R
5000|$|Barges {{used the}} marker as a <b>mooring</b> <b>post</b> {{during and after}} the first phase of Washington Monument's construction, which began in 1848. However, that usage was not the reason that the stone was named a [...] "pier", because the {{surveyor}} who erected it had already used that term himself. The developers of the Washington Monument originally wanted the memorial to be located {{at the site of the}} Jefferson Pier. However, concerns about the bearing capacity of the soil prevented that from occurring. The marker served as benchmark when the Monument's construction began, but later disappeared from view.|$|E
50|$|During {{their stay}} on Mir, {{the crew members}} {{performed}} 5 EVA's. These took place on 8 January 1990 (2h 56m) to mount two star sensors for navigation on the Kvant-module, 11 January (2h 54m) to attach tools and remove a space exposure experiment rack, 26 January (3h 2m) using the new Orlan-DMA spacesuits. The cosmonauts attached a <b>mooring</b> <b>post</b> {{to the outside of}} the airlock compartment and removed a Kurs antenna so it could not interfere with future EVAs. The fourth EVA took place on 1 February (4h 59m) to test 'Ikar', a maneuvering unit. The final EVA was on 5 February (3h 45m).|$|E
50|$|Alnmouth's port {{has had a}} fitful 800-year {{documented}} history. Eustace de Vesci {{was granted}} royal permission to establish a port and a Wednesday fish market in 1207 or 1208. Although clearly associated with a nascent fishing industry, the port also engaged in local and foreign trade. Richard de Emeldon, a burgage holder of the village, is recorded as having developed the harbour, and Alnmouth is {{shown to be a}} port of call by a Crown request for the supply of a boat to assist in a military campaign to Gascony in 1306. No archaeological remains of the port from this time are known, and there was probably little infrastructure beyond <b>mooring</b> <b>posts,</b> and possibly wooden jetties. The topography of the river and mudflats would provide a sheltered beaching-point for vessels.|$|R
50|$|The silted {{margins of}} the river, in an area 15 m from the bridge, are {{important}} habitats for waterfowl and species. The presence of European alder (Alnus glutinosa), Poplar (Populus), Willow (Salix) and Reed bed provides a habitat for various species of Spanish pond turtle (Mauremys leprosa), Viperine water snake (Natrix maura), Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), Muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata), Greylag goose (Anser anser), Grey wagtail (Motacilla cinerea) and the Common nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos). Along the banks are various aromatic plants, such as Rosemary, Lavander and Mint. To the east stretches a fertile floodplain, used for cultivating sweet potato and corn, and as pasturelands for dairy cattle. Downstream are vestiges of the ancient fluvial port with <b>mooring</b> <b>posts,</b> and a cisterns that was situated near the (now disappeared) inn and tollhouse. Tp {{the west of the}} bridge, near the entrance to the south, is the old village grocery, while to the east (and few meters away) is the municipal market.|$|R
2500|$|The commissioners {{decided to}} proceed with the revised plan, and a new Act of Parliament was {{obtained}} on 26 June 1802. The two locks were to be located at Harlam Hill and Kingerby, to improve navigation on the upper section. The Act stipulated that oak <b>mooring</b> <b>posts</b> should be provided at [...] intervals, to indicate the distance from Ferriby. Although most of the materials were ordered promptly, the work was hampered by a shortage of finance, and progress was very slow. After the project engineer, Samuel Porter, died in July 1808, the work ground to a halt, and in 1824 Sir John Rennie (the Younger) was asked for advice. He stated that the work specified by his father should be completed. He also recommended that the Ferriby sluice should be reconstructed, with the sills [...] lower, and that the capacity of the channel should be doubled, by making it wider and deeper. Finally, a new entrance lock should be built, capable of accommodating boats of 60 tons, and [...] wide. Another Act of Parliament followed in 1825, and work began again in 1826. Progress was faster, although there were delays to the drainage works, caused by litigation over the rates that each district should pay towards the project.|$|R
5000|$|In the New Kingdom Taweret's {{image was}} {{frequently}} {{used to represent}} a northern constellation in zodiacs. This image is attested in several astronomical tomb paintings, including the Theban tombs of Tharwas (tomb 353), Hatshepsut's famed advisor Senemut (tomb 232), and the pharaoh Seti I (KV17) in the Valley of the Kings. The image of this astral Taweret appears almost exclusively next to the Setian foreleg of a bull. The latter image represents the Big Dipper and {{is associated with the}} Egyptian god of chaos, Seth. The relationship between the two images is discussed in the Book of Day and Night (a cosmically focused mythological text from the Twentieth Dynasty, c. 1186-1069 BCE) as follows: [...] "As to this foreleg of Seth, it is in the northern sky, tied down to two <b>mooring</b> <b>posts</b> of flint by a chain of gold. It is entrusted to Isis as a hippopotamus guarding it." [...] Though the hippopotamus goddess is identified in this text as Isis, not Taweret, this phenomenon is not uncommon in later periods of Egyptian history. When assuming a protective role, powerful goddesses like Isis, Hathor, and Mut assumed the form of Taweret, effectively becoming a manifestation of this goddess. Likewise, Taweret gradually absorbed qualities of these goddesses and is commonly seen wearing the Hathoric sun disc that is ichnographically associated with both Hathor and Isis.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of moored Italian {{fishing boats}} in San Francisco, [s. d. ]. A line of small sloops is pictured at center, each <b>moored</b> to a <b>post</b> {{extending}} from the water beneath. In contrast to the others, the fourth boat in from the foreground appears to have its sail partially unfurled. More boats can be seen along the wharf in the left background...|$|R
40|$|In {{the more}} than twenty years since the Supreme Court created Title VII’s sexual {{harassment}} protections, judges and feminist legal scholars have struggled to create a clear conceptual account of the harm sexual harassment inflicts. Many courts and scholars were content to justify sexual harassment law by arguing that it vindicates women’s interest in workplace equality; however, several feminist legal scholars revealed the inadequacy of this account by the late 1990 s, suggesting instead that harassment should be understood as inflicting dignitary harm. The failure to reach consensus about sexual harassment law’s purpose appeared without significant consequence until courts began developing sexual harassment law for non-workplace settings. Operating without clear conceptual <b>mooring</b> <b>posts,</b> courts have created narrow, cabined sexual harassment protections governing settings like prisons, often without principled justifications for doing so. To address this problem, this Article argues that we should return to the dignity-based account of sexual harassment law introduced by workplace sexual harassment scholars in the late 1990 s. However, in order to use this dignity analysis for non-workplace settings, the analysis used must be expanded and particularized to account for the different dignity expectations a person may reasonably hold in different institutional contexts. To this end, this Article offers a nuanced, context-specific analysis that will allow courts to determine “what dignity demands” in each institutional setting. The Article demonstrates that this dignity framework will allow courts to identify the key considerations that should be weighed when creating sexual harassment doctrine for locations other than the workplace...|$|R
60|$|The little harbour opened {{from the}} sea between towering cliffs, and behind a lonely rock, pierced with many caves and blow-holes through which the sea in storm time sent its thunderous voice, {{together}} with a fountain of drifting spume. Hence, it wound westwards in a serpentine course, guarded at its entrance by two little curving piers to left and right. These were roughly built of dark slates placed endways and held together with great beams bound with iron bands. Thence, it flowed up the rocky bed of the stream whose winter torrents had of old cut out its way amongst the hills. This stream was deep at first, with here and there, where it widened, patches of broken rock exposed at low water, full of holes where crabs and lobsters were to {{be found at the}} ebb of the tide. From amongst the rocks rose sturdy posts, used for warping in the little coasting vessels which frequented the port. Higher up, the stream still flowed deeply, for the tide ran far inland, but always calmly for all the force of the wildest storm was broken below. Some quarter mile inland the stream was deep at high water, but at low tide there were at each side patches of the same broken rock as lower down, through the chinks of which the sweet water of the natural stream trickled and murmured after the tide had ebbed away. Here, too, rose <b>mooring</b> <b>posts</b> for the fishermen's boats. At either side of the river was a row of cottages down almost on the level of high tide. They were pretty cottages, strongly and snugly built, with trim narrow gardens in front, full of old-fashioned plants, flowering currants, coloured primroses, wallflower, and stonecrop. Over the fronts of many of them climbed clematis and wisteria. The window sides and door posts of all were as white as snow, and the little pathway to each was paved with light coloured stones. At some of the doors were tiny porches, whilst at others were rustic seats cut from tree trunks or from old barrels; in nearly every case the window ledges were filled with boxes or pots of flowers or foliage plants.|$|R
60|$|Sometimes {{she would}} step {{into one of}} the gondolas that were always kept in waiting, <b>moored</b> to painted <b>posts</b> at the door--when she could escape from the {{attendance}} of that oppressive maid, who was her mistress, and a very hard one--and would be taken all over the strange city. Social people in other gondolas began to ask each other who the little solitary girl was whom they passed, sitting in her boat with folded hands, looking so pensively and wonderingly about her. Never thinking that it would be worth anybody's while to notice her or her doings, Little Dorrit, in her quiet, scared, lost manner, went about the city none the less.|$|R
60|$|A body of Spanish foot-soldiers of {{the advance}} guard, sturdy mountaineers of Galicia, sprang forward {{to climb the}} side of the height next the sea, {{at the same time a}} number of cavaliers and hidalgos of the royal {{household}} attacked the Moors who guarded the pass below. The <b>Moors</b> defended their <b>posts</b> with obstinate valor. The Galicians were repeatedly overpowered and driven down the hill, but as often rallied, and, being reinforced by the hidalgos and cavaliers, returned to the assault. This obstinate struggle lasted for six hours: the strife was of a deadly kind, not merely with crossbows and arquebuses, but hand to hand with swords and daggers; no quarter was claimed or given on either side--they fought not to make captives, but to slay. It was but the advance of the Christian army that was engaged; so narrow was the pass along the coast that the army could proceed only in file: horse and foot and beasts of burden were crowded one upon another, impeding each other and blocking up the narrow and rugged defile. The soldiers heard the uproar of the battle, the sound of trumpets, and the war-cries of the Moors, but tried in vain to press forward to the assistance of their companions.|$|R
