50|$|The first FTIR spectrometers were {{developed}} for far-infrared range. The {{reason for this}} has to do with the <b>mechanical</b> <b>tolerance</b> needed for good optical performance, which is related to the wavelength of the light being used. For the relatively long wavelengths of the far infrared, ~10 μm tolerances are adequate, whereas for the rock-salt region tolerances have to be better than 1 μm. A typical instrument was the cube interferometer developed at the NPL and marketed by Grubb Parsons. It used a stepper motor to drive the moving mirror, recording the detector response after each step was completed.|$|E

Sixty healthy subjects were divided equally into three groups receiving either high intensity (250 V), low intensity (3 – 4 V) or sham electrical stimulation directly over the spinal cord for 30 minutes. Following high intensity stimulation, subjects felt significantly more elated, leisurely and less tense and, contrary to reports on patients with clinical pain, had lower <b>mechanical</b> pain <b>tolerances.</b> There were no correlations between changes in mood and changes in <b>mechanical</b> pain <b>tolerances.</b> These findings contrasted {{with the lack of}} any significant differences in mood or <b>mechanical</b> pain <b>tolerances</b> in a second study where 20 subjects received either high intensity or sham stimulation across the left shoulder joint.

40|$|In {{circular}} {{particle accelerators}} {{it is very}} important to minimize field errors in the magnets. These errors, that can be both systematic and random, can lead to a reduction of the dynamic aperture. In particular, systematic multipolar components arise from pole shaping, which usually differs from the ideal one, while random components come from <b>mechanical</b> <b>tolerances</b> and magnet assembly. In this note we deal with the effects of random field errors on the dynamic aperture of the DAΦNE main rings. Being very difficult to correlate these errors to their mechanical origins, we use experimental data from other machines in operation or construction (PEP, AGS, ALS) to estimate the magnitude of random components in our simulations. In the first part of this note we briefly describe the <b>mechanical</b> <b>tolerances</b> which are the source of random errors. In the second part we estimate the magnitude of the errors to be used in the tracking code. Finally we compare the dynamic apertures obtained with and without random components...|$|R

Improved trapping efficiency and increased ion capacity are observed relative to a three-dimensional (3 -D) ion trap with similar mass range. Mass resolution comparable to 3 -D traps is readily achieved, including high resolution at slower scan rates, although adequate <b>mechanical</b> <b>tolerance</b> of the trap structure is a requirement.
