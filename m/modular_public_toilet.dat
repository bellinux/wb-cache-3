40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Public</b> {{pay-per-use}} <b>toilets</b> are {{the only}} alternative to open defecation for {{a significant number of}} people in many low-income, urban neighbourhoods where insecure tenure, space constraints, and/or cost make private sanitation facilities unfeasible. This study explores <b>public</b> <b>toilet</b> use, characteristics of <b>public</b> <b>toilet</b> customers and possible improvements to <b>public</b> <b>toilet</b> facilities in four neighbourhoods in Accra, Ghana, the country with the highest reliance on shared sanitation facilities globally. Reliance on <b>public</b> <b>toilets</b> ranged considerably depending on neighbourhood affluence, but even some people living in compounds with a private <b>toilet</b> used a <b>public</b> <b>toilet.</b> The vast majority of users were adults. Few <b>public</b> <b>toilet</b> customers could foresee owning a household toilet in the coming year, mostly because of lack of space, and they voiced desires for more and cleaner <b>public</b> <b>toilets</b> with better provision of handwashing facilities. Improved accessibility and management of <b>public</b> <b>toilets,</b> along with facilities more suitable for children, could reduce open defecation...|$|R

In South Africa for instance, many people have reported being afraid to use <b>public</b> <b>toilets.</b> There have been several highly publicized murders in <b>public</b> <b>toilets,</b> such as the Seocho-dong <b>public</b> <b>toilet</b> murder case.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a decline in the state of <b>public</b> <b>toilets</b> and, with over 50 % of the <b>public</b> <b>toilets</b> being closed, this has become a cause for public concern. Local {{authorities}} have no legal requirement to provide <b>public</b> <b>toilets</b> and because of this some towns have no <b>public</b> <b>toilet</b> provision. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the adequacy and provision of the <b>public</b> <b>toilets</b> on the Island of Guernsey. This investigation was undertaken through observation of the 30 <b>public</b> <b>toilet</b> blocks and a questionnaire exploring the provision of the <b>public</b> <b>toilets,</b> emailed to a representative sample of the Island population. All 18 of the toilets for those with disabilities, 26 (out of 30) of the male and 27 (out of 30) of the female <b>public</b> <b>toilets</b> were observed and the response rate to the questionnaire was 48 % (n= 264). Results confirmed that there are an adequate number of <b>public</b> <b>toilet</b> facilities for the Island’s population in accordance with the British Standards. Fifty-five per cent of respondents were satisfied or very satisfied with the number of facilities. However concerns were expressed about the number of the <b>public</b> <b>toilet</b> that were closed during the winter months and the proposed closure of toilets in an effort to save money. The research concluded that the adequacy, provision and impression of the <b>public</b> <b>toilets</b> on Guernsey was good, but more attention needs to be given to year-round availability and the additional facilities required within them...|$|R

40|$|Toilet {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} constructed environments for human beings. However, as commented by the United Nations, whether this important space for sanitation is accessible for all is a critical issue for modern society. In recent years, to promote and implement equal opportunity, accessible <b>public</b> <b>toilet</b> has become a more common facility in modern cities. More countries and individual cities have also established their specific ordinances, regulations, codes of practice and guidelines for accessible <b>public</b> <b>toilets.</b> However, whether the quality of accessible <b>public</b> <b>toilets</b> meets the needs and preferences of users with different capabilities is still a question. Disregarding its success in economic development, Hong Kong is a city that is constantly being criticised by local residents and visitors alike about the quality of its <b>public</b> <b>toilets.</b> Persons with disabilities also always complain about the unavailability and inaccessibility of <b>public</b> <b>toilets.</b> A study on accessible <b>public</b> <b>toilets</b> has been conducted in Hong Kong since 2009. The study aims to review and then improve the quality of accessible <b>public</b> <b>toilets.</b> One of the key areas of the study is to compare the legislation of standards for accessible <b>public</b> <b>toilets</b> in different places. Through a review of the legislation of standards of accessible <b>public</b> <b>toilets</b> in the United Kingdom — a country with well-developed legislation and standards for persons with disabilities to access toilets — and then a comparison with those of Hong Kong, this paper aims to generate inspirations for the improvement of the standards of accessible <b>public</b> <b>toilets</b> and in turn to promote equal opportunity for all.

40|$|Visually {{impaired}} persons (VIPs) face {{a number}} of difficulties in everyday life. Among different <b>public</b> environments, <b>public</b> <b>toilets</b> present the most barriers for VIPs. In recent years, more governments and professionals have invested resources and effort into {{improving the quality of}} <b>public</b> <b>toilets,</b> including enhancing barrier-free, universal and inclusive policy and design concepts. However, the focus of such work is generally on assisting people with impaired mobility. The needs of people with visual impairments have rarely been concerned. Taking Hong Kong as a case study, this paper first reviews the current general public policy on assisting people with disabilities. The paper then focuses on the current deficiencies in the assistance provided for VIPs in accessing <b>public</b> <b>toilets.</b> By advocating an all-level public policy, the paper reviews and discusses the design of <b>public</b> <b>toilets</b> from three levels: plane, line and point. The plane level refers to the overall system, networks, and links for VIPs to access the <b>public</b> <b>toilet</b> environment. The line level refers to the links between different places and facilities for VIPs to access individual <b>public</b> <b>toilets.</b> The point level refers to individual <b>public</b> <b>toilets,</b> compartments, and facilities.

40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>toilets</b> are {{generally}} small building structures {{but they could}} have big impact on {{the image of a}} city. Visitors and business people from overseas as well as local residents will all have the chance to use <b>public</b> <b>toilets.</b> As such, the design for <b>public</b> <b>toilet</b> needs to be considered very carefully. Artificial lighting and mechanical ventilation systems are two of the main building services installations that would need to be considered. However, in order to achieve a green and odourless <b>public</b> <b>toilet</b> one cannot rely solely on the artificial lighting and mechanical ventilation systems. The overall integration of the architectural design with the lighting and ventilation systems of the toilet is indeed necessary. The Building Services Branch of the Architectural Services Department of the HKSAR Government has been involved in the design and construction of hundreds of <b>public</b> <b>toilets</b> in Hong Kong. This paper shares the experiences of the department in designing for green and odourless <b>public</b> <b>toilets.</b> Various types of environmentally friendly lighting and ventilation systems employed in <b>public</b> <b>toilets</b> will be discussed.

40|$|The Cultural {{heritage}} {{can sometimes}} be concealed by the notions of predetermined minds and actions. The {{aim of this study}} is to identify the characteristics of the <b>public</b> <b>toilets</b> as material objects and intangible cultural heritage. This has been done through gathering of source material concerning the <b>public</b> <b>toilets</b> from the 1860 ’s until today, in the city of Göteborg, Sweden. The study shows that it is not possible to present only the architectural and technical history of the <b>public</b> <b>toilets,</b> without also presenting the intangible history. It was found that the <b>public</b> <b>toilets</b> served as a hidden refuge for homosexual men from 1920 and forward. It was also found that <b>public</b> <b>toilets</b> had values that were not acknowledged within public cultural heritage listings. A reevaluation of the <b>public</b> <b>toilets</b> as a part of cultural heritage would lead to a representation of homosexual men as part of the cultural heritage.

40|$|Objectives: The {{principal}} objective {{of a healthy}} living environment {{is to improve the}} quality of everyday life. Visually impaired persons (VIPs) encounter many difficulties in everyday life through a series of barriers, particularly in relation to <b>public</b> <b>toilets.</b> This study aimed to explore the concerns of VIPs in accessing <b>public</b> <b>toilets,</b> and identify methods for improvement. Considerations about user participation are also discussed. Study design: Adopting a case study approach, VIPs were invited to participate in the research process. Methods: In addition to in-depth interviews and field visits, models and a simulated full-scale environment were produced to facilitate the VIPs to voice their opinions. Results: The key findings indicate that the design of <b>public</b> <b>toilets</b> for promoting <b>public</b> health should be considered and tackled from a three-level framework: plain, line and point. Governments, professionals and the public need to consider the quality of <b>public</b> <b>toilets</b> in terms of policy, implementation and management. Conclusions: VIPs have the right to access <b>public</b> <b>toilets.</b> Governments and professionals should respect the particular needs and concerns of VIPs. A three-level framework (plain, line and point) is required to consider the needs of VIPs in accessing <b>public</b> <b>toilets,</b> and user participation is a good way to reveal the actual needs of VIPs.
