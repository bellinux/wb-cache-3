5|$|The Portuguese {{commissioning}} pennant (flâmula) {{is a long}} triangular flag, {{green on}} the hoist and red on the fly. It is to be flown on the <b>main</b> <b>mast</b> of the naval ships commanded by officers.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} Sea Cloud featured royal-sails over single topgallant- and double top-sails on the fore and mizzen masts. The <b>main</b> <b>mast</b> {{was equipped with}} a royal-sail over double topgallant- and double top-sails. Today the first three masts are rigged with double top-sails, single topgallants, royals and a main skysail.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} search radars installed {{were the}} SK air-search radar and SG surface-search radar during World War II. They were {{located on the}} mainmast and forward fire-control tower of the battleships, respectively. As the war drew to a close, the United States introduced the SK-2 air-search radar and SG surface-search radar; the Iowa class was updated {{to make use of}} these systems between 1945 and 1952. At the same time, the ships' radar systems were augmented with the installation of the SP height finder on the <b>main</b> <b>mast.</b> In 1952, AN/SPS-10 surface-search radar and AN/SPS-6 air-search radar replaced the SK and SG radar systems, respectively. Two years later the SP height finder was replaced by the AN/SPS-8 height finder, which was installed on the <b>main</b> <b>mast</b> of the battleships.|$|E
60|$|The same {{sea that}} swept away the boat carried the fore and <b>main</b> <b>masts</b> of the Wellington by the board, and {{extinguished}} all her lights.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>main</b> <b>masts</b> of Mühlacker radio {{transmitter}} {{and the former}} Konstantynów Radio Mast also have aircraft warning lights at the outermost bases of their anchor guys.|$|R
25|$|In {{common with}} all other Royal Navy wooden screw gunvessels, the Cormorants were rigged as barques, that is with three masts, with the fore and <b>main</b> <b>masts</b> square rigged, and the mizzen fore-and-aft rigged.|$|R
5|$|After {{twenty minutes}} {{fighting}} both Victory and Temeraire, the Redoutable {{had been reduced}} to a floating wreck. Temeraire had also suffered heavily, damaged when Redoutables <b>main</b> <b>mast</b> fell onto her poop deck, and having had her own topmasts shot away. Informed that his ship was in danger of sinking, Lucas finally called for quarter to the Temeraire. Harvey sent a party across under the second lieutenant, John Wallace, to take charge of the ship.|$|E
5|$|Australia and New Zealand {{were built}} with a {{different}} arrangement. The spotting top on the <b>main</b> <b>mast</b> was deleted and an armoured spotting tower was built instead into the conning tower where it was better protected, had an improved field of vision and {{direct access to the}} primary conning position. The rear Transmitting Station was also deleted and the forward TS was consequently enlarged. Their 'A' turrets were built with the improvements listed above.|$|E
5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} {{with a single}} rudder. The vessels handled well and had a tight turning radius, but they suffered from weather helm and tended to drift while underway. The ships' crew numbered ten officers and 191enlisted men, and later increased to eleven officers and 197enlisted men. The ships carried several smaller boats, including two picket boats, one launch, two yawls, and one dinghy. These were handled with a large derrick that was fitted to the <b>main</b> <b>mast.</b>|$|E
50|$|A five-masted jackass barque, {{which has}} {{probably}} never been built, would {{be equipped with}} square-rigged fore and <b>main</b> <b>masts,</b> with a partially square-rigged and partially fore-and-aft rigged mizzen mast, and fore-and-aft rigged jigger and spanker masts.|$|R
50|$|The <b>main</b> <b>masts</b> for {{the bridge}} were erected {{in the week}} commencing 1 May 2006 using the largest crane in the UK.It was officially opened on 12 September 2006 (also the centenary of Newport Transporter Bridge) and is the ninth {{crossing}} of the Usk in the city.|$|R
50|$|During {{the age of}} sail, {{the sheer}} hulk was used {{extensively}} as a floating crane for tasks that required heavy lift. At the time, the heaviest single components of ships were the <b>main</b> <b>masts,</b> and sheer hulks were essential for removing and replacing them, {{but they were also}} used for other purposes.|$|R
5|$|The USS Constellation vs La Vengeance, or the Action of 1 February 1800, was a single-ship action fought between frigates of the French Navy and the United States Navy {{during the}} Quasi-War. In the battle the American frigate USS Constellation {{tried to take}} the French frigate La Vengeance as a prize. Both ships got heavily damaged. Although the French frigate struck her colors twice, she managed to flee after the <b>main</b> <b>mast</b> of her {{opponent}} had fallen.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{launched}} on 15 August 1799 {{under the command}} of Captain Sever. After fitting-out in Rhode Island, she set off on her maiden voyage 6 January 1800 sailing in company with Essex to escort merchant ships to the East Indies. Six days later she lost all of her masts during a gale. Because her rigging had been set and tightened in a cold climate, it had slackened once she reached warmer temperatures. Without the full support of the rigging, all the masts fell during a four-hour period, killing one crew member trying to repair the <b>main</b> <b>mast.</b>|$|E
5|$|The ships' hulls were {{constructed}} from transverse and longitudinal steel frames, and {{were divided into}} nine watertight compartments, with a double bottom that extended for 60percent {{of the length of}} the hull. Both vessels had two pole masts fitted with spotting tops. Nautilus and Albatross had different bows; Nautilus received a clipper bow, while Albatross had a ram bow like contemporary German light cruisers. Albatross also had a higher forecastle that extended {{to the base of the}} <b>main</b> <b>mast,</b> while Nautilus was completed with a superstructure deck that began just aft of the fore mast.|$|E

5|$|A {{more recent}} {{critical}} review of contemporary sources doesn't require a supposed typo in 1771 {{to explain this}} shorter measurement for the mizzen whilst {{at the same time}} offers supporting evidence of its cap being at the taller supposed normal height. Sydney Parkinson's sketches and paintings of Cooks Bark Endeavour along with the 1771 Woolwich Yard Bark Endeavour spar measurements National Maritime Museum in Greenwich NMM ZAZ6594, and other contemporary sources suggest that the shorter mizzen mast was not stepped in the hold/keelson, but instead was stepped in the lower deck 10ft above this as was sometimes done. This would bring its standing height at the cap to within a supposed normal height of around 8– 9ft below the <b>main</b> <b>mast</b> cap and approx 5.5ft below the foremast cap when comparing the heights of the standing mast tops (excludes top and gallant masts) from the level of the water line. Whereas the shorter mizzen stepped in the hold on the keelson instead of the lower deck would make the standing mizzen cap 18ft below the <b>main</b> <b>mast</b> cap which is clearly not the case when critically examining Sydney Parkinson's drawings and the contemporary painting titled HMS Endeavour off the coast of New Holland, by Samuel Atkins c. 1794 {{at the top of this}} page. Zooming this painting also reveals that the position of the mizzen channel is forward to inline with the mast which it is when looking at the angle of the mizzen chainplates on the original as fitted draught NMM ZAZ7844. Using these mizzen chainplate angles from this as fitted draught it is possible to extrapolate where the top of the standing mast could be and combined with the similar shroud angles Sydney Parkinson drew in his sketch of the larboard quarter of Endeavour support this theory of the shorter standing mizzen stepped in the lower deck which would make its standing cap 10 foot higher than if stepped in the hold.|$|E
5|$|A list of {{necessary}} equipment was compiled by 1 August and included, among other things, massive cables, capstans, pulleys, and 40 pounds of tallow for lubrication. The proposed salvage team comprised 30 Venetian mariners and a Venetian carpenter with 60 English sailors to serve them. The two ships {{to be used}} as hulks were Jesus of Lübeck and Samson, each of 700tons burthen and similar in size to the Mary Rose. Brandon was so confident of success that he reassured the king that it would only be a matter of days before they could raise the Mary Rose. The optimism proved unfounded. Since the ship had settled at a 60-degree angle to starboard much of it was stuck deep into the clay of the seabed. This made it virtually impossible to pass cables under the hull and required far more lifting power than if the ship had settled on a hard seabed. An attempt to secure cables to the <b>main</b> <b>mast</b> appears only to have resulted in its being snapped off.|$|E
5|$|The {{converted}} carrier aircraft were heavier {{versions of}} their land-based predecessors and this required {{a host of}} changes to Graf Zeppelins original design: the existing catapults needed modernization; stronger winches were necessary for the arresting gear; the flight deck, elevators and hangar floors also required reinforcement. Changes in naval technology dictated other alterations as well: installation of air search radar sets and antennas; upgraded radio equipment; an armored fighter director cabin mounted on the <b>main</b> <b>mast</b> (which in turn meant a heavier, sturdier mast to accommodate the cabin's added weight); extra armoring for the bridge and fire control center; a new curved funnel cap to shield the fighter director cabin from smoke; replacing the single-mount 20mm AA guns with quadruple Flakvierling 38 guns (with a corresponding increase in ammunition supply) to improve overall AA defense; and additional bulges {{on either side of}} the hull to preserve the ship's stability under all this added weight.|$|E
50|$|INS Tarangini is a three-masted barque, {{commissioned}} in 1997 as a sail {{training ship}} for the Indian Navy. She is square rigged on the fore and <b>main</b> <b>masts</b> and fore-and-aft rigged on the mizzen mast. She {{was constructed in}} Goa to a design by the British naval architect Colin Mudie, and launched on 1 December 1995.

50|$|The longwave {{transmitter}} traces {{its existence}} {{to the special}} state of the Saar territory in the 1950s: self-governed, but economically linked to France. It was reintegrated to the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957 after a referendum of the Saar people. The transmitter was built in 1954, broadcasting since 1 January 1955, on land which is now located inside German borders.In 1959, one of its <b>main</b> <b>masts</b> was relocated to a vertical state none 183 khtz.

5|$|The hull {{had four}} levels {{separated}} by three decks. The terminology for {{these in the}} 16th century was still not standardised so the terms used here are those that were applied by the Mary Rose Trust. The hold lay furthest down in the ship, right above the bottom planking below the waterline. This is where the kitchen, or galley, was situated and the food was cooked. Directly aft of the galley was the mast step, a rebate in the centre-most timber of the keelson, right above the keel, which supported the <b>main</b> <b>mast,</b> and next to it the main bilge pump. To increase {{the stability of the}} ship, the hold was where the ballast was placed and much of the supplies were kept. Right above the hold was the orlop, the lowest deck. Like the hold it was partitioned and was also used as a storage area for everything from food to spare sails.|$|E
5|$|Yamato {{was again}} dry-docked at Kure for further {{upgrades}} to all her radar and anti-aircraft systems from 25 February to 18 March 1944. Each {{of the two}} beam-mounted 6.1 inch (155-mm) triple turrets was removed and replaced by three pairs of 5-inch (127-mm) AA guns in double mounts. In addition, 8 triple and 26 single 25mm AA mounts were added, increasing {{the total number of}} 127mm and 25mm anti-aircraft guns to 24 and 162, respectively. Shelters were also added on the upper deck for the increased AA crews. A Type 13 air search and Type 22, Mod 4, surface search/gunnery control radar were installed, and the <b>main</b> <b>mast</b> was altered. Her radar suite was also upgraded to include infrared identification systems and aircraft search and gunnery control radars. She left the dry dock on 18 March and went through several trials beginning on 11 April. Yamato left Kure on 21 April and embarked soldiers and materiel the following day at Okinoshima for a mission to Manila, reaching the Philippines on 28 April. She then moved on to Malaya to join Vice-Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa's Mobile Fleet at Lingga; this force arrived at Tawi Tawi on 14 May.|$|E
5|$|To the south, HMS Bellerophon was {{in serious}} trouble as the huge {{broadside}} of Orient pounded the ship. At 19:50 the mizzenmast and <b>main</b> <b>mast</b> both collapsed and fires broke out simultaneously at several points. Although the blazes were extinguished, the ship had suffered more than 200 casualties. Captain Darby recognised that his position was untenable and ordered the anchor cables cut at 20:20. The battered ship drifted away from the battle under continued fire from Tonnant as the foremast collapsed as well. Orient had also suffered significant damage and Admiral Brueys had been struck in the midriff by a cannonball that almost cut him in half. He died fifteen minutes later, remaining on deck and refusing to be carried below. Orients captain, Luc-Julien-Joseph Casabianca, was also wounded, struck in the face by flying debris and knocked unconscious, while his twelve-year-old son had a leg torn off by a cannonball as he stood beside his father. The most southerly British ship, Majestic, had become briefly entangled with the 80-gun Tonnant, and in the resulting battle, suffered heavy casualties. Captain George Blagdon Westcott was among the dead, killed by French musket fire. Lieutenant Robert Cuthbert assumed command and successfully disentangled his ship, allowing the badly damaged Majestic to drift further southwards so that by 20:30 it was stationed between Tonnant and the next in line, Heureux, engaging both. To support the centre, Captain Thompson of Leander abandoned the futile efforts to drag the stranded Culloden off the shoal and sailed down the embattled French line, entering the gap created by the drifting Peuple Souverain and opening a fierce raking fire on Franklin and Orient.|$|E
5000|$|A four-masted jackass barque is square-rigged {{on the two}} {{foremost}} <b>masts</b> (fore and <b>main</b> <b>masts)</b> and fore-and-aft rigged on the {{two after}} masts (the mizzen and spanker or jiggermasts). Some 19th-century sailors called such a ship [...] "a fore-and-aft schooner chasing a brig". In general a jackass barque is a sailing ship which is half square-rigged and half fore-and-aft rigged. The name {{appears to be an}} erroneous reference to a mule, which is half horse and half donkey.|$|R

50|$|A {{fisherman}} is a sail placed {{between the}} fore and <b>main</b> <b>masts</b> of a sailing ship, usually a schooner but also including brigantines. All {{four of its}} sides are typically set flying. The purpose of a fisherman is to catch light winds aloft, {{as it is a}} large sail set high on the masts. In some rigs, it overlaps other sails and spars such as the gaff of the foresail and therefore must be fully lowered and re-raised at every tack and jibe.|$|R
5|$|The {{identification}} of the ship led to significant public interest in the salvage operation, and caused a great demand for the objects which were brought up. Though many of the objects could not be properly conserved {{at the time and}} subsequently deteriorated, many were documented with pencil sketches and watercolour drawings which survive to this day. John Deane ceased working on the wreck in 1836, but returned in 1840 with new, more destructive methods. With the help of condemned bomb shells filled with gunpowder acquired from the Ordnance Board he blasted his way into parts of the wreck. Fragments of bombs and traces of blasting craters were found during the modern excavations, but {{there was no evidence that}} Deane managed to penetrate the hard layer that had sealed off the Tudor levels. Deane reported retrieving a bilge pump and the lower part of the <b>main</b> <b>mast,</b> both of which would have been located inside the ship. The recovery of small wooden objects like longbows suggests that Deane did manage to penetrate the Tudor levels at some point, though this has been disputed by the excavation project leader Margaret Rule. Newspaper reports on Deane's diving operations in October 1840 report that the ship was clinker built, but since the sterncastle is the only part of the ship with this feature, an alternative explanation has been suggested: Deane did not penetrate the hard shelly layer that covered most of the ship, but only managed to get into remains of the sterncastle that today no longer exist. Despite the rough handling by Deane the Mary Rose escaped the wholesale destruction by giant rakes and explosives that was the fate of other wrecks in the Solent.|$|E

50|$|The {{foundation}} {{kept her}} as a live museum in Alexandria and sailed {{her as a}} goodwill ambassador {{for the city of}} Alexandria. She participated in several races and tall ship reunions sailing as far north as Boston and as far south as the Gulf of Mexico. During this time she was rigged with bowsprit, jib-boom, foremast, mainmast and mizzenmast, all three masts fitted with topmasts and gaffs for the gaff sails and the fore topmast fitted with three yards for the topsails. The sails were four headsails, three gaff sails and three gaff topsails (one on each mast), upper and lower square topsails on the foremast, a staysail between the fore and <b>main</b> <b>masts</b> and another staysail between the <b>main</b> and mizzen <b>masts.</b>|$|R
