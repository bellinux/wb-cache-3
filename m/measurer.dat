5|$|The {{resignation}} in May 1836 of Senator Isaac Hill, who {{had been}} elected governor of New Hampshire, left a brief interim opening to be filled by the state legislature. With Hill's term as senator due to expire in March 1837, the legislature also had to fill the six-year term to follow. Pierce's candidacy for the Senate was championed by state Representative John P. Hale, a fellow Athenian at Bowdoin. After much debate, the legislature chose John Page to fill the rest of Hill's term. In December 1836, Pierce {{was elected to the}} full term, to commence in March 1837, becoming at age 32 one of the youngest members in Senate history to that point. The election came at a difficult time for Pierce, as his father, sister, and brother were all seriously ill, while Jane continued to suffer from chronic poor health. As senator, he was able to help his old friend Nathaniel Hawthorne, who often struggled financially, procuring a sinecure as <b>measurer</b> of coal and salt at the Boston Customs House that allowed the author time to continue writing.|$|E

25|$|The {{more mundane}} and secular {{activities}} in the background, {{as evidenced by the}} image of the city crane used by the hospital to measure and fill wine barrels, place the altarpiece's spiritual vision in a worldly context. The measuring of wine was a lucrative concession given to the hospital by the city authorities during the mid-1300s and in the 1470s the hospital secured the right to fish in the Reye river – both activities shown in the far background. The figure of the hospital brother has been variously identified as Jan Floreins or Josse Willems; both held the position of the hospital's wine <b>measurer</b> and so were associated with the crane.|$|E
2500|$|The 12-metre {{class rules}} stipulated that the hull {{had to be}} the same {{thickness}} throughout and could not be made lighter in the bow and stern. The other challengers demanded that core samples be taken from the plastic hull to show its thickness. At one press conference Dennis Conner asked, [...] "Why would you build a plastic yacht ... unless you wanted to cheat?" [...] Despite attempts to defuse the situation, the [...] "cheating comment" [...] added to the controversy surrounding the Louis Vuitton challenge races. Chris Dickson, skipper of the Kiwi Magic (KZ 7), took the controversy in stride and with humor, and Conner has subsequently stated his regret over his comment. New Zealand syndicate head Sir Michael Fay's comment was that core samples would be taken [...] "over my dead body". Eventually some small holes were drilled to test the hull, and ultrasonic testing was done to rule out air pockets in the construction. The boat was found to be within class rules, and the issue was set aside. Fay ceremoniously lay {{down in front of the}} <b>measurer</b> before the samples were taken.|$|E
2500|$|The word [...] (synthronos) is [...] used as [...] "co-occupant of {{the divine}} throne"; however, like the above etymology, it is not found in any source materials. It is {{supported}} by Saul Lieberman and Peter Schäfer, who give further reasons why {{this might be a}} viable etymology. The Latin word Metator (messenger, guide, leader, <b>measurer)</b> had been suggested by Eleazar ben Judah of Worms (c. 1165 – c. 1230), Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman, and brought to light again by Hugo Odeberg. When transliterated into the Hebrew language, we get מטיטור or מיטטור. Gershom Scholem argues that there is no data to justify the conversion of metator to metatron. Philip Alexander also suggests this as a possible origin of Metatron, stating that the word Metator also occurs in Greek as mitator–a word for an officer in the Roman army who acted as a forerunner. Using this etymology, Alexander suggests the name may have come about as a description of [...] "the angel of the Lord who led the Israelites through the wilderness: acting like a Roman army metator guiding the Israelites on their way". Another possible interpretation is that of Enoch as a metator showing them [...] "how they could escape from the wilderness of this world into the promised land of heaven". Because we see this as a word in Hebrew, Jewish Aramaic, and Greek, Alexander believes this gives even more strength to this etymology.|$|E

When {{referred to as a}} comparative instrument, (a use I shall now make of it very extensively,) it will not often require particular precaution in the observation; but when used as an absolute <b>measurer,</b> it will be needful that the barometric pressure and the temperature be taken into account, and that the graduation of the instruments should be to one scale; the hundredths and smaller divisions of a cubical inch are quite fit for this purpose, and the hundredth may be very conveniently taken as indicating a DEGREE of electricity.|$|E

40|$|Non-uniformity {{of steps}} within a flight {{is a major}} risk factor for falls. Guidelines and {{requirements}} for uniformity of step risers and tread depths assume the measurement system provides precise dimensional values. The state-of-the-art measurement system {{is a relatively new}} method, known as the nosing-to-nosing method. It involves measuring the distance between the noses of adjacent steps and the angle formed with the horizontal. From these measurements, the effective riser height and tread depth are calculated. This study was undertaken for the purpose of evaluating the measurement system to determine how much of total measurement variability comes from the step variations versus that due to repeatability and reproducibility (R 2 ̆ 6 R) associated with the <b>measurers.</b> Using an experimental design quality control professionals call a measurement system experiment, two <b>measurers</b> measured all steps in six randomly selected flights, and repeated the process on a subsequent day.

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} {{a new version}} of the High Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR) which attempts to approximate a given multivariate function by an expansion starting from a constant term and continuing by adding univariate components and then the terms whose multivariances increase via bivariance, trivariance and so on. HDMR works well as long as the function under consideration behaves, more or less, additive. Factorized High Dimensional Model Representation (FHDMR) was considered as a powerful approach working well when the multivariate function under consideration is mostly multiplicative. The additivity of the function was defined through its HDMR components by introducing additivitiy <b>measurers.</b> FHDMR, unfortunately, disabled us to define efficient multiplicativity <b>measurers.</b> Hence, we develope Logarithmic High Dimensional Model Representation (LHDMR) to this end.
