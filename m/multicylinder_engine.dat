As the crankshaft undergoes {{a great deal of}} sideways load from each cylinder in a <b>multicylinder</b> <b>engine,</b> it must be supported by several such bearings, not just one at each end. This was a factor in the rise of V8 engines, with their shorter crankshafts, in preference to straight-8 engines. The long crankshafts of the latter suffered from an unacceptable amount of flex when engine designers began using higher compression ratios and higher rotational speeds. High performance engines often have more main bearings than their lower performance cousins for this reason.|$|E

40|$|The {{overheating}} {{of certain}} cylinders of <b>multicylinder</b> <b>engines</b> is of vital import to those concerned with large power installations. Such overheating {{results in a}} loss of power from the engine. Therefore, engines must be underrated by manufacturers or else customers must install power plants which are somewhat oversized. Overheating of certain cylinders of an engine has been attributed to a nonuniform distribution of the pulsating fluid (air or fuel-air mixture) flowing through the individual cylinders of the engine. For this reason, manifolds (intake or exhaust) have been adjudged as the probable cause for overheating. To date, the majority of analytical work applicable to manifolds has been limited to intake manifolds or to steady flow conditions. The experimental work related to nonsteady flow has been limited to the total overall flow of a particular engine. The present work is concerned with the experimental procedure for measuring the pulsating flow through the individual cylinders of an internal combustion engine. Experimentation has been carried out by motoring a three cylinder, two stroke cycle, General Motors Diesel Engine. By motoring the engine with a dynamometer, complications arising from high temperatures and pressures were circumvented.

It is revealed that the multicylinder, analytical friction, and detailed fuel pump modelling can have an important effect on the prediction of diesel engine transient operation and thus should not be excluded from a complete transient model.

40|$|To meet {{demands for}} {{improvements}} in the CO 2 emissions and fuel economy of gasoline passenger car engines advanced combustion strategies, to replace (or combine with) conventional spark ignition, must be developed and implemented. One possible strategy is homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) achieved using negative valve overlap (NVO). However, several issues {{need to be addressed}} before this combustion strategy can be fully implemented in a production vehicle, one being to increase the upper load limit. One constraint at high loads is that the combustion becomes too rapid, leading to excessive pressure-rise rates and large pressure fluctuations (ringing), causing noise.

Tests with a <b>multicylinder</b> <b>engine</b> reported here confirmed that there is significant potential to increase the upper load limit using charge stratification.

Stoichiometric operation was found to be possible for both homogeneous and stratified modes, across a wide operating range, with small compromises in maximum load and fuel consumption.

For multi-cylinder engines, two cases are examined, both assuming crank kinematics is obtained from a single shaft-encoder fitted at the forward end of the crankshaft. In one case, a NARX model is constructed to provide an inverse relationship between the kinematics at the encoder location and the pressure trace in an arbitrary cylinder. In the second case, by transforming the kinematics (to emulate a local encoder), a different NARX model is constructed to relate the kinematics at the crank location of a particular cylinder to the corresponding pressure trace.

40|$|Gasoline {{compression}} ignition (GCI) {{has been shown}} {{as one of the}} advanced combustion concepts that could potentially provide a pathway to achieve cleaner and more efficient combustion engines. Fuel and air in GCI are not fully premixed compared to homogeneous charge {{compression ignition}} (HCCI), which is a completely kinetic-controlled combustion system. Therefore, the combustion phasing can be controlled by the time of injection, usually postinjection in a multiple-injection scheme, to mitigate combustion noise. Gasoline usually has longer ignition delay than diesel. The autoignition quality of gasoline can be indicated by research octane number (RON). Fuels with high octane tend to have more resistance to autoignition, hence more time for fuel-air mixing. In this study, three fuels, namely, aromatic, alkylate, and E 30, with similar RON value of 98 but different hydrocarbon compositions were tested in a <b>multicylinder</b> <b>engine</b> under GCI combustion mode. Considerations of exhaust gas recirculating (EGR), start of injection, and boost were investigated to study the sensitivity of dilution, local stratification, and reactivity of the charge, respectively, for each fuel. Combustion phasing (location of 50 % of fuel mass burned) was kept constant during the experiments. This provides similar thermodynamic conditions to study the effect of fuels on emissions. Emission characteristics at different levels of EGR and lambda were revealed for all fuels with E 30 having the lowest filter smoke number and was also most sensitive to the change in dilution. Reasonably low combustion noise (< 90 [*]dB) and stable combustion (coefficient of variance of indicated mean effective pressure < 3 %) were maintained during the experiments.

A number of recent combustion experiments and vehicle studies demonstrated that reformulated gasoline can reduce vehicle engine-out, tail-pipe, running-loss, and evaporative emissions. Some of these studies were extended to understand the fundamental relationships between fuel composition and emissions. To further establish these relationships, it was necessary to develop advanced analytical methods for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of hydrocarbons in fuels and vehicle emissions. The development of real-time techniques such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, laser diode spectroscopy, and atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometry were useful in studying the transient behavior of exhaust emissions under various engine operating conditions. Laboratory studies using specific fuels and fuel blends were carried out using pulse flame combustors, single- and <b>multicylinder</b> <b>engines,</b> and vehicle fleets.

It tends to be said that difference equations identify with differential equations as discrete mathematics identifies with continuous mathematics. Any individual who has made an investigation of differential equations will realize that even elementary examples can be difficult to solve. By contrast, elementary difference equations are moderately simple to study. For many reasons, computer scientists take an interest difference equations. For instance, difference equations often emerge while determining the cost of an algorithm in big-O notation. In 1943, the difference equations were commonly used for solving partial differential equations. Problems involving time-dependent fluid flows, neutron diffusion and transport, radiation flow, thermonuclear reactions, and problems involving the solution of several simultaneous partial differential equations are being solved by the use of difference equations. Other than the utilization of difference equations as approximations to ODEs and PDEs, they afford a powerful method for the analysis of electrical, mechanical, thermal, and other systems {{in which there is a}} recurrence of identical sections. By using the difference equations, the investigation of the conduct of electric-wave filters, multistage amplifiers, magnetic amplifiers, insulator strings, continuous beams of equal span, crankshafts of <b>multicylinder</b> <b>engines,</b> acoustical filters, etc., is enormously facilitated. The standard techniques for solving such systems are generally very lengthy when the number of elements involved is large. The use of difference equations greatly reduces the complexity and labor in problems of this type.|$|R
