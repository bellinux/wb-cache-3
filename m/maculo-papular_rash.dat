40|$|Leishmania donovani is {{considered}} the causative organism of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and post-kala-azar dermal leishmania-sis (PKDL). Testing of 4 / 29 DNA samples from VL and PKDL patients as well as 2 / 7 field isolates showed an aberrant internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS 1) {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) pattern, which upon sequencing strongly matched Leptomonas seymouri, thus confirming its presence in Indian leishmaniasis. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a vector-borne disease caused byreplication of parasites of the Leishmania donovani complex (L. donovani and L. infantum) within the macrophage-phagocytic system. In the Indian subcontinent and parts of Africa, its trans-mission is anthroponotic (2), with post-kala-azar dermal leish-maniasis (PKDL) being a sequel of VL, and is characterized by a macular, <b>maculo-papular,</b> or nodular <b>rash</b> (11).

The diagnosis of erythema infectiosum is usually based on the appearance and pattern of the rash. The aim of our study was to establish the frequency and clinical characteristics of erythema infectiosum in children, in the period between 2000 and 2004 at the Institute of Child and Youth Health Care, Department of Dermatology, Novi Sad. There were 0. 23 % of children with a clinical picture of infectious erythema. There was an outbreak of erythema infectiosum from December 2001 to September 2002. The highest number of cases was detected in April and May of 2002. from 2003 to 2004, no cases with infekctious erythema were diagnosed. The average age of infected children was 7. 38.

40|$|Two {{distinct}} syndromes {{associated with}} dengue virus infection are prevalent in tropical Asia; dengue fever, a benign disease characterized by fever, myalgia, leucopenia and a <b>maculo-papular</b> <b>rash</b> and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), accompanied by fever, shock, hemorrhagic diathesis {{and a significant}} mortality. 1 The dengue viruses, a group of antigenically related members of the Group B arthropod-borne virus family, are transmitted from man to man by the mosquito, Aedes aegypti. Multiple {{members of the group}} are known to be simultaneously transmitted in large urban areas of tropical Asia. Dengue disease syndromes of both types may occur concurrently, DHF usually is restricted to the indigenous population, while dengue fever may occur in both indigenous and non-indigenous residents of an area.

40|$|Mediterranean {{spotted fever}} (MSF) is a tick-borne acute febrile disease caused by Rickettsia conorii and {{characterized}} by fever, <b>maculo-papular</b> <b>rash</b> {{and a black}} eschar {{at the site of}} the tick bite ('tache noir'). We describe the case of a 58 -year-old man affected by MSF who developed atrial fibrillation. The patient presented himself to the hospital after 7 days of fever, malaise and severe headache. Cardiac auscultation revealed a chaotic heart rhythm and an electrocardiogram confirmed atrial fibrillation with a fast ventricular response. Diagnosis of MSF was made after the appearance of a maculo-papular skin rash, and treatment with oral doxycycline was started. An immunofluorescence antibody test confirmed R. conorii infection. The patient recovered after 7 days of treatment. Cardiac arrhythmia is a rare complication of MSF. Inflammation may play a role in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation. R. conorii is an intracellular bacterium which could trigger atrial fibrillation. Our patient was previously healthy and had no reported history of cardiac disease. This suggests that heart function should be monitored in MSF patients even in the absence of underlying risk factors...|$|E
40|$|SummaryIntroduction:Murine or endemic typhus, {{caused by}} Rickettsia typhi, has been {{reported}} in all continents. In the 1970 s, no cases of murine typhus were diagnosed in Tunisia. Methods:The clinico-epidemiological characteristics of seven cases of murine typhus diagnosed at our hospitals since 1993 are reported. Diagnosis was confirmed by indirect fluorescence assay detecting specific R. typhi antibodies. Results:Murine typhus occurred in all ages from 18 – 80 years during the hot season in rural areas. Clinical features were: sudden onset of fever and absence of eschar in all cases, with <b>maculo-papular</b> <b>rash</b> (five cases), prostration (four cases), meningism (three cases) and pneumonia (four cases). Frequent laboratory findings were moderate thrombopenia (four cases) and elevated transaminases (four cases). Before the results of serology, clinical diagnoses were Mediterranean Spotted Fever (four cases), Q fever (one case), pneumonia (one case), and lymphocytic meningitis (one case). Serology confirmed all diagnoses with cross-reactivity with Rickettsia conorii. Conclusion:Murine typhus exists in Tunisia and its prevalence is underestimated.

40|$|PURPOSE: This phase II {{study with}} the topoisomerase I {{inhibitor}} topotecan was performed to determine its clinical activity and toxicity in patients with metastatic or locally unresectable colorectal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Topotecan 1. 5 mg/m 2 was administered intravenously by 30 -minute infusion for 5 days. Fifty-nine patients entered the study, 2 were considered ineligible and 57 were evaluable for response and toxicity. RESULTS: Partial response was obtained in 4 of 57 evaluable patients (7 %). The median duration of the response was 11 months (range 9. 3 to 12. 2). This topotecan regimen was very well tolerated. A total of 290 courses were given, with a median of 4 courses per patient (range, 1 to 18). The major toxic effects were leuko- and neutropenia (91 %), grade 3 - 4 in 48 % and 79 % of courses, respectively, but with only 2 infectious complications. Other side effects were grade 1 alopecia (77 %) in 46 %, nausea (35 %), vomiting (10 %), and <b>maculo-papular</b> <b>rash</b> (6 %).

40|$|Background. Rickettsia rickettsii, Rickettsia parkeri, and Rickettsia akari are {{the most}} common causes of spotted fever group rickettsioses {{indigenous}} to the United States. Infected patients characteristically present with a <b>maculo-papular</b> <b>rash,</b> often accompanied by an inoculation eschar. Skin biopsy specimens are often obtained from these lesions for diagnostic evaluation. However, a species-specific diagnosis is achieved infrequently from pathologic specimens because immunohistochemical stains do not differentiate among the causative agents of spotted fever group rickettsiae, and existing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays generally target large gene segments that may be difficult or impossible to obtain from formalin-fixed tissues. Methods. This work describes the development and evaluation of a multiplex real-time PCR assay for the de-tection of these 3 Rickettsia species from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) skin biopsy specimens. Results. The multiplex PCR assay was specific at discriminating each species from FFPE controls of unrelated bacterial, viral, protozoan, and fungal pathogens that cause skin lesions, as well as other closely related spotted fever group Rickettsia species. Conclusions. This multiplex real-time PCR demonstrates greater sensitivity than nested PCR assays in FFPE tissues and provides an effective method to specifically identify cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, rickettsialpox, and R. parkeri rickettsiosis by using skin biopsy specimens...|$|E
40|$|Purpose To {{report on}} a child {{presenting}} with iritis and angle closure glaucoma caused by caterpillar hairs. Methods A 12 -year-old girl complained of sudden pain and visual loss in her left eye while she was playing in a pinewood. Two hours later, she developed <b>maculo-papular</b> <b>rash</b> on her limbs. On examination, left visual acuity was 1 / 10. The affected eye showed conjunctival hyperemia, corneal edema, anterior chamber flare (4 + cells). Corneal staining with fluorescein disclosed diffuse superficial punctate keratopathy. Left IOP was 55 mm Hg. Visante OCT of the affected eye showed a thin, translucent, linear foreign body into the cornea and anterior chamber up to the irido-corneal angle. Topical steroids, antibiotics, cycloplegics, hypotensive eyedrops, and intravenous mannitol were given. Results Inspection of {{the place where the}} girl was playing revealed the presence of numerous processionary pine caterpillars. On the basis of this finding and the clinical data, a diagnosis of iritis and angle closure glaucoma caused by caterpillar hairs was made. After 3 days’ treatment, corneal edema and anterior chamber inflammation resolved, IOP returned to normal, and visual acuity was 10 / 10 again. However, a small iris cyst was still visible on OCT scans. Conclusion Ocular lesions caused by caterpillar hairs are uncommon. Ophthalmologists should be aware that intense iritis with angle closure glaucoma {{may be the result of}} the penetration of caterpillar hairs into the eye. OCT scans may be important to confirm the diagnosis. </br...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Prevalence {{of sexually}} {{transmitted}} infection shows regional variations. Though a rising trend of prevalence of viral STI s has been observed, syphilis still continues to remain a commonly diagnosed STI. Aim: To study {{the current status of}} acquired syphilis in a tertiary care hospital. Materials and Methods: Retrospective analysis of all the cases of acquired syphilis registered in our hospital from 2005 to 2009 was done. Complete epidemiological, clinical, and investigational data were recorded and assessed. Observation: Total of 570 cases attended the STI clinic from year 2005 to 2009. 42 (7. 36 %) cases were diagnosed as syphilis. There were 32 (74 %) males and 11 (26 %) were females. 25 (60 %) were married. Only two patients were less than 15 years of age. Primary syphilis was diagnosed in 21 (50 %), secondary in 10 (24 %), and latent in 11 (26 %) cases. Two (9. 5 %) of primary syphilis showed multiple chancre. Concomitant primary chancre and lesions of secondary syphilis were seen in 2 (20 %) patients. Secondary syphilis presented as condyloma lata (50 %), <b>maculo-papular</b> <b>rash</b> (40 %), and lues maligna in one patient who was HIV positive. Mixed infection was diagnosed in eight patients of which herpes genitalis was the commonest. Two patients were serologically positive for HIV. Conclusion: Incidence of syphilis had shown a constant trend over last 5 years. In lieu of change in trends of sexual practices, condyloma was the commonest presentation of secondary syphilis. Pustular syphilis was observed in association with HIV and could be a marker of the immune-deficient state...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY A {{patient with}} {{systemic}} lupus erythematosus who developed reactive amyloidosis associated {{with high levels of}} serum amyloid-A protein (SAA) is reported. The possible relevance of elevated SAA levels in the aetiology of amyloidosis is discussed. Amyloidosis may complicate many rheumatological conditions and other diseases associated with chronic inflammation. The factors which render certain individuals with similar diseases susceptible to amyloid production are not clear. Recently {{it has been suggested that}} levels of the acute phase reactant serum amyloid-A protein (SAA) appear to correlate with amyloid development. ' We describe a patient with {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE), a disease rarely associated with amyloidosis, who developed severe renal amyloidosis and was found to have a very high level of SAA. Case report A 56 -year-old Caucasian male presented in August 1971 with malaise and a photosensitive, <b>maculo-papular</b> <b>rash,</b> predominantly on the trunk, arms, and legs. Investigations showed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 118 mm in the first hour, leucopenia (1. 5 x 109 /l), and a polyclonal elevation of IgG. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were not detected. A skin biopsy, however, was consistent with SLE, with epidermal atrophy, lique-faction necrosis of the basal layer, and patchy lymphocytic infiltration. The rash was controlled with prednisolone 5 mg to 10 mg daily, but the leucopenia and the raised IgG persisted. In 1978 his creatinine clearance was 87 ml/min with no evidence of proteinuria. In May 1981 he was admitted with worsening of the rash, together with proteinuria. On examination there was a widespread maculopapular rash wit...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the last}} fifteen years {{barbital}} and phenobarbital have achieved a justifiable popularity as sedatives and anticonvulsants. In spite of widespread use, reports of untoward reactions are not numerous, {{and there seems to be}} a general tendency to regard these drugs as harmless. A careful survey of the literature shows that this idea is not entirely correct, and the present purpose is to call attention to certain reactions which may occur following the use of barbital and phenobarbital. Menninger 5 gives a very complete review of the 43 cases reported before I 928, and emphasing the skin eruptions, adds three from his own clinic. It is impossible to state the frequency with which reactions occur. Prior to I 920, when larger doses were in vogue, reactions appear to have been rather common. With the use of smaller doses reactions have been less frequent, but have by no means disappeared. Menninger estimates reactions as occurring in one to three per cent of the cases. It is significant that most manufacturers of the drugs advise small doses and their advertising circulars warn of all the possible reactions. Little attention has been paid to this advice, and on the contrary when reactions do occur the tendency is to call them everything except drug reactions. There are two distinct types of reaction,-a general systemic reaction with signs of acute poisoning, and skin reactions, with or without mild systemic disturbance. Menninger further classifies the skin reactions into the urticarial type, and the toxic type characterized by a diffuse erythematous <b>maculo-papular</b> <b>rash.</b> Occasionally vesicles have been noted with the dermatitis and in the cases reported by Heuber 3 and Haxthausen 2 hemorrhagic areas developed. The duration of the skin rash has varied greatly, ranging from two days to three weeks. Exfoliative dermatitis and pigmentation of the skin have been reported. Although most of the severe reactions have occurred after large doses, Phillips 6, Bothe', Jackson 4, and Menninger 5, all report re- 34...|$|E
