5|$|Chemotherapy agents used in {{combination}} {{have been found}} to be effective against neuroblastoma. Agents commonly used in induction and for stem cell transplant conditioning are platinum compounds (cisplatin, carboplatin), alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, <b>melphalan),</b> topoisomerase II inhibitor (etoposide), anthracycline antibiotics (doxorubicin) and vinca alkaloids (vincristine). Some newer regimens include topoisomerase I inhibitors (topotecan and irinotecan) in induction which {{have been found to}} be effective against recurrent disease.|$|E
25|$|Most {{chemotherapy}} {{is delivered}} intravenously, although {{a number of}} agents can be administered orally (e.g., <b>melphalan,</b> busulfan, capecitabine).|$|E
25|$|Thalidomide {{is used as}} a {{first line}} {{treatment}} in multiple myeloma in combination with dexamethasone or with <b>melphalan</b> and prednisone, to treat acute episodes of erythema nodosum leprosum and for maintenance therapy.|$|E
25|$|Thalidomide {{has been}} {{approved}} by the FDA for ENL and MM in combination with dexamethasone. EMA has also approved it to treat MM in combination with prednisone and/or <b>melphalan.</b> Orphan indications by the FDA include graft-versus-host disease, mycobacterial infection, recurrent aphthous ulcers, severe recurrent aphthous stomatitis, primary brain malignancies, HIV-associated wasting syndrome, Crohn's disease, Kaposiâ€™s sarcoma, myelodysplastic syndrome and hematopoietic stem cell transplantantion.|$|E
25|$|Some {{types of}} {{chemotherapy}} are gonadotoxic and may cause infertility. Chemotherapies with high risk include procarbazine and other alkylating {{drugs such as}} cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, busulfan, <b>melphalan,</b> chlorambucil, and chlormethine. Drugs with medium risk include doxorubicin and platinum analogs such as cisplatin and carboplatin. On the other hand, therapies with low risk of gonadotoxicity include plant derivatives such as vincristine and vinblastine, antibiotics such as bleomycin and dactinomycin, and antimetabolites such as methotrexate, mercaptopurine, and 5-fluorouracil.|$|E
25|$|The subtypes of alkylating {{agents are}} the {{nitrogen}} mustards, nitrosoureas, tetrazines, aziridines, cisplatins and derivatives, and non-classical alkylating agents. Nitrogen mustards include mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, <b>melphalan,</b> chlorambucil, ifosfamide and busulfan. Nitrosoureas include N-Nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU), carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU) and semustine (MeCCNU), fotemustine and streptozotocin. Tetrazines include dacarbazine, mitozolomide and temozolomide. Aziridines include thiotepa, mytomycin and diaziquone (AZQ). Cisplatin and derivatives include cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin. They impair cell function by forming covalent bonds with the amino, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, and phosphate groups in biologically important molecules. Non-classical alkylating agents include procarbazine and hexamethylmelamine.|$|E
25|$|Some {{chemotherapy}} {{drugs are}} used in diseases other than cancer, such as in autoimmune disorders, and noncancerous plasma cell dyscrasia. In some cases they are often used at lower doses, {{which means that the}} side effects are minimized, while in other cases doses similar to ones used to treat cancer are used. Methotrexate is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis and multiple sclerosis. The anti-inflammatory response seen in RA is thought to be due to increases in adenosine, which causes immunosuppression; effects on immuno-regulatory cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme pathways; reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines; and anti-proliferative properties. Although methotrexate is used to treat both multiple sclerosis and ankylosing spondylitis, its efficacy in these diseases is still uncertain. Cyclophosphamide is sometimes used to treat lupus nephritis, a common symptom of systemic lupus erythematosus. Dexamethasone along with either bortezomib or <b>melphalan</b> is commonly used as a treatment for AL amyloidosis. Recently, bortezomid in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone has also shown promise as a treatment for AL amyloidosis. Other drugs used to treat myeloma such as lenalidomide have shown promise in treating AL amyloidosis.|$|E
2500|$|Hyperthermia {{has also}} been shown to help prevent or reverse [...] "chemo-{{resistance}}." [...] Chemotherapy resistance sometimes develops over time as the tumors adapt and can overcome the toxicity of the chemo medication. [...] "Overcoming chemoresistance has been extensively studied within the past, especially using CDDP-resistant cells. In regard to the potential benefit that drug-resistant cells can be recruited for effective therapy by combining chemotherapy with hyperthermia, it was important to show that chemoresistance against several anticancer drugs (e.g. mitomycin C, anthracyclines, BCNU, <b>melphalan)</b> including CDDP could be reversed at least partially by the addition of heat.|$|E
2500|$|The postmeiotic {{phase of}} mouse {{spermatogenesis}} is {{very sensitive to}} environmental genotoxic agents, because as male germ cells form mature spermatozoa they progressively lose the ability to repair DNA damage. [...] Irradiation of male mice during late spermatogenesis can induce damage that persists for at least 7 days in the fertilizing spermatozoa, and disruption of maternal DNA double-strand break repair pathways increases spermatozoa-derived chromosomal aberrations. [...] Treatment of male mice with <b>melphalan,</b> a bifunctional alkylating agent frequently employed in chemotherapy, induces DNA lesions during meiosis that may persist in an unrepaired state as germ cells progress though DNA repair-competent phases of spermatogenic development. [...] Such unrepaired DNA damages in spermatozoa, after fertilization, can lead to offspring with various abnormalities.|$|E
2500|$|There are no {{expected}} pharmacokinetic {{interactions between}} thalidomide and other medicines {{due to its}} neutral effects on p-glycoprotein and P450 cytochromes. [...] It may interact with sedatives due to its sedative action. It may also interact with bradycardic agents due to its bradycardia-inducing effects. The risk of peripheral neuropathy may be increased by concomitant treatment with other agents known to cause peripheral neuropathy. The risk of venous thromboembolisms with thalidomide seems to be increased when patients are treated with oral contraceptives or other cytotoxic agents (including doxorubicin and <b>melphalan)</b> concurrently. Thalidomide may interfere with the contraceptive effects of various contraceptives and hence it is advised that women of reproductive age use at least two different means of contraception {{to ensure that no}} child will be conceived while they are receiving thalidomide.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{people have}} a history of {{exposure}} to chemotherapy (especially alkylating agents such as <b>melphalan,</b> cyclophosphamide, busulfan, and chlorambucil) or radiation (therapeutic or accidental), or both (e.g., at the time of stem cell transplantation for another disease). Workers in some industries with heavy exposure to hydrocarbons such as the petroleum industry have a slightly higher risk of contracting the disease than the general population. Xylene and benzene exposure has been associated with myelodysplasia. Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange are at risk of developing MDS. A link may exist between the development of MDS [...] "in atomic-bomb survivors 40 to 60 years after radiation exposure" [...] (in this case, referring to people who were in close proximity to the dropping of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II).|$|E
50|$|Melflufen is a peptidase-potentiated {{derivative}} of <b>melphalan,</b> a widely used classical chemotherapeutic {{belonging to a}} group of alkylating agents developed more than 50 years ago. Substantial clinical experience has been accumulated about <b>melphalan</b> since then. Numerous derivatives of <b>melphalan,</b> designed to increase the activity or selectivity, have been developed and investigated in vitro or in animal models. Melflufen was synthesized, partly due to previous experience of an alkylating peptide cocktail named Peptichemio and its anti-tumor activity is being investigated.|$|E
5000|$|Patients {{over age}} 65 and {{patients}} with significant concurrent illness often cannot tolerate stem cell transplantation. For these patients, {{the standard of}} care has been chemotherapy with <b>melphalan</b> and prednisone. Recent studies among this population suggest improved outcomes with new chemotherapy regimens, e.g., with bortezomib. [...] Treatment with bortezomib, <b>melphalan,</b> and prednisone had an estimated overall survival of 83% at 30 months, lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone an 82% survival at 2 years and <b>melphalan,</b> prednisone and lenalidomide had a 90% survival at 2 years. Head-to-head studies comparing these regimens have not been performed [...]|$|E

50|$|Treatment {{depends on}} the type of {{amyloidosis}} that is present. Treatment with high dose <b>melphalan,</b> a chemotherapy agent, followed by stem cell transplantation has showed promise in early studies and is recommended for stage I and II AL amyloidosis. However, only 20-25% of people are eligible for stem cell transplant. Chemotherapy and steroids, with <b>melphalan</b> plus dexamethasone, is mainstay treatment in AL people not eligible for transplant.|$|E
50|$|Most {{chemotherapy}} {{is delivered}} intravenously, although {{a number of}} agents can be administered orally (e.g., <b>melphalan,</b> busulfan, capecitabine).|$|E
50|$|Chemically, {{the drug}} is best {{described}} as the ethyl ester of a dipeptide consisting of <b>melphalan</b> and the amino acid derivative para-fluoro-L-phenylalanine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Melphalan</b> (trade name Alkeran, {{in former}} USSR {{also known as}} Sarcolysin) is a {{chemotherapy}} drug belonging to the class of nitrogen mustard alkylating agents.|$|E
50|$|Compared to <b>melphalan,</b> melflufen {{exhibits}} {{significantly higher}} in vitro and in vivo activity in several models of human cancer.A preclinical study, performed at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, demonstrated that melflufen induced apoptosis in multiple myeloma cell lines, even those resistant to conventional treatment (including <b>melphalan).</b> In vivo effects in xenografted animals were also observed, and the results confirmed by M Chesi and co-workers - in a unique genetically engineered mouse model of multiple myeloma - {{are believed to be}} predictive of clinical efficacy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Melphalan</b> is {{currently}} being used to treat ocular retinoblastoma, a pediatric solid tumor. This is accomplished via transarterial catheter based slow pulsed infusion into the ophthalmic artery.|$|E
5000|$|Addition of {{glucocorticoids}} (like prednisolone) or methotrexate or alkylating drugs (like cyclophosphamide or <b>melphalan)</b> to the [...] "7+3" [...] regimen is also of {{no benefit}} in AML.|$|E

50|$|There is no {{standard}} {{treatment for}} LCDD. High-dose <b>melphalan</b> {{in conjunction with}} autologous stem cell transplantation {{has been used in}} some patients. A regimen of bortezomib and dexamethasone has also been examined.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{a debate}} about whether {{specialty}} drugs should be managed as a medical benefit or a pharmaceutical benefit. Infused or injected medications are usually covered under the medical benefit and oral medications are covered under the pharmacy benefit. Self-injected medications may be either. [...] "Many biologics, such as chemotherapy drugs, are administered in a doctor's office and require extensive monitoring, further driving up costs." [...] Chemotherapy is usually delivered intravenously, although a number of agents can be administered orally (e.g. specialty drugs, <b>melphalan</b> (trade name Alkeran), busulfan, capecitabine).

50|$|The {{original}} {{nitrogen mustard}} drug, mustine (HN2), {{is no longer}} commonly in use because of excessive toxicity. Other nitrogen mustards developed as treatments include cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, uramustine, ifosfamide, <b>melphalan,</b> and bendamustine. Bendamustine has recently re-emerged as a viable chemotherapeutic treatment.|$|E
50|$|Pharmacokinetic {{analysis}} of plasma samples showed a rapid formation of melphalan; concentrations generally exceeded those of melflufen during ongoing infusion. Melflufen rapidly disappeared from plasma after infusion, while <b>melphalan</b> typically peaked {{a few minutes}} after the end of infusion. This suggests that melflufen is rapidly and widely distributed to extravasal tissues, in which <b>melphalan</b> is formed and thereafter redistributed to plasma. This rapid disappearance from plasma is likely due to hydrolytic enzymes.The Zn(2+) dependent ectopeptidase (also known as alanine aminopeptidase), degrades proteins and peptides with a N-terminal neutral amino acid. Aminopeptidase N is frequently overexpressed in tumors and has been associated with the growth of different human cancers suggesting it as a suitable target for anti-cancerous therapy.|$|E
50|$|Treatment of {{plasma cell}} leukemia is by {{supportive}} care and systemic chemotherapy. Combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (or dexamethasone) can be used. A second combination {{is the use of}} cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone, and thalidomide as for myeloma. Another regimen termed VMCP/VBAP uses alternating vincristine, <b>melphalan</b> (M), cyclophosphamide, prednisone/vincristine, carmustine, doxorubicin, and prednisone polychemotherapy. In general, combination chemotherapy has resulted in median survivals of 18 to 20 months compared to 2 to 6 months when single agent therapy is used. There are anecdotal reports of excellent responses and 2- to 3-year disease-free survivals after autologous stem cell transplantation. Autologous transplantation may increase benefit from conventional therapy and high dose <b>melphalan</b> may prolong progression free and overall survival.|$|E
50|$|Cyclophosphamide, used in {{combination}} with thalidomide or lenalidomide and dexamethasone has documented efficacy as an off-label treatment of AL amyloidosis. It {{appears to be an}} alternative to the more traditional treatment with <b>melphalan</b> in people who are ill-suited for autologous stem cell transplant.|$|E
50|$|<b>Melphalan</b> {{chemically}} alters through alkylation of the DNA nucleotide guanine, {{and causes}} linkages between strands of DNA. This chemical alteration inhibits DNA synthesis and RNA synthesis, functions necessary for cells to survive. These changes cause cytotoxicity in both dividing and non-dividing tumor cells.|$|E
