500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2010 Smith {{performed}} at various festivals and events. Her father stated that [...] "because she is still so young, we don't want her doing complete shows on her own and we don't want her doing too much." [...] Appearances included the Mercedes-Benz World Summer Concert in Weybridge on 4 July, That Glorious Noise charity concert in aid of muscular dystrophy in Cleethorpes on 17 July and the Last Night of the Kenwood Proms on 21 August, {{as well as the}} wedding of Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford. Smith also opened the Serenata festival. Angela Young, reviewing the festival for the Bournemouth Daily Echo, said [...] "Faryl Smith was my personal highlight of the Thursday night line-up, her bizarrely powerful voice (considering her diminutive size and age) taking <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> <b>away</b> and it contrasted so well with her naivete as she said 'at least it's not raining' â€“ just as the heavens opened." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{the digital}} sheet music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Little Mix's vocal {{range in the}} song span from the note of Eb3 to Cb5. Written in the key of E minor, the track is set in common time at a moderate tempo of 70 beats per minute. [...] Lyrically, [...] "DNA" [...] uses scientific vocabulary to portray themes of love and obsession. Fiona Shepherd of The Scotsman wrote that the song lionises a strong man. 4Music's Trent Maynard said that it paints a moody picture of love and deep seated biological compatibility. The chorus includes the lyrics, [...] "It's in his DNA, D-D-D-DNA / It's in his DNA / And he just takes <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> <b>away,</b> b-b-b-breath away / I feel it every day / And that's what makes a man, not hard to understand / Perfect in every way, I see it in-his-face / Nothing more to say, it's in his D-D-D-D-DNA". Leigh-Anne Pinnock does the song's half-spoken half-rapped middle eight in a spooky tone, mentioning, [...] "It's all about his kiss, contaminates my lips, our energy connects, it's simple genetics, I'm the X to his Y". Music website, Popjustice, likened the song to British girl group, the Spice Girls, writing, [...] "'DNA' is the 'Say You'll Be There' to the 'Wannabe' of 'Wings'".|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{shake my}} locks,' {{retorted}} the old man, 'and snow covers the land.

60|$|I {{waited for}} a {{momentary}} lull, and then I {{opened the door and}} slipped out. The first breath of cold strong air was like wine to me after my confinement, but a moment later I felt <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> taken <b>away,</b> and I was lifted almost from my feet by a sudden gust. I linked my arm around the trunk of a swaying pine tree and hung there till the lull came. Up into the darkness from that unseen gulf below came showers of spray, white as snow, falling like rain all about me. It was a night to remember.|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>breath</b> {{was taken}} <b>away</b> by this unheard-of audacity, and I braced myself against screams, flight, and other {{feminine}} demonstrations of terror. The young lady did {{nothing of the}} kind. She turned her back to us, leaned against the tree, and to my astonishment I saw her slim shoulders shaken with laughter. At length, very slowly, she looked around, and in her face struggled curiosity and fear and merriment. Nick made another bow, worthy of Versailles, and she gave a frightened little laugh.|$|R
6000|$|The sun was gilding {{the rim of}} {{the desert}} rampart when we began the ascent of the foothills of Buckskin. A steep trail wound zigzag up the {{mountain}} We led our horses, as it was a long, hard climb. From time to time, as I stopped to catch <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> I gazed <b>away</b> across the growing void to the gorgeous Pink Cliffs, far above and beyond the red wall which had seemed so high, and then out toward the desert. The irregular ragged crack in the plain, apparently only a thread of broken ground, was the Grand Canyon. How unutterably remote, wild, grand was that world of red and brown, of purple pall, of vague outline! ...|$|R

6000|$|It was a breezy {{climb to}} 1110 Dupont Street; and {{although}} the street had been graded, the houses retained their airy elevation, and were accessible only by successive flights of wooden steps to the front door, which still gave perilously upon the street, sixty feet below. I now painfully appreciated Enriquez's adaptation of the time-honored joke about the second floor. An invincible smell of garlic almost took <b>my</b> remaining <b>breath</b> <b>away</b> as the door was opened to me by a swarthy Mexican woman, whose loose camisa seemed to be slipping from her unstable bust, and was held on only by the mantua-like shawl which supplemented it, gripped by one brown hand. Dizzy from my ascent to that narrow perch, which looked upon nothing but the distant bay and shores of Contra Costa, I felt as apologetic as if I had landed from a balloon; but the woman greeted me with a languid Spanish smile and a lazy display of white teeth, as if my arrival was quite natural. Don Enriquez, [...] "of a fact," [...] was not himself in the casa, but was expected [...] "on the instant." [...] "Donna Urania" [...] was at home.|$|R
6000|$|Nobody {{liked this}} {{irruption}} into the downstairs rooms; the two [...] "gave trouble,"--a dire offence; Nannie's {{sense of duty}} to her charge led to requests and demands that took <b>my</b> mother's <b>breath</b> <b>away.</b> Eggs at unusual times, the reboiling of milk, the rejection of an excellent milk pudding--not negotiated respectfully but dictated as of right. Nannie was a dark, longfeatured, taciturn woman in a grey dress; she had a furtive inflexibility of manner that finally dismayed and crushed and overcame. She conveyed she was [...] "under orders"--like a Greek tragedy. She was that strange product of the old time, a devoted, trusted servant; she had, as it were, banked all her pride and will with the greater, more powerful people who employed her, {{in return for a}} life-long security of servitude--the bargain was nonetheless binding for being implicit. Finally they were to pension her, and she would die the hated treasure of a boarding-house. She had built up in herself an enormous habit of reference to these upstairs people, she had curbed down all discordant murmurings of her soul, her very instincts were perverted or surrendered. She was sexless, her personal pride was all transferred, she mothered another woman's child with a hard, joyless devotion that was at least entirely compatible with a stoical separation. She treated us all as things that counted for nothing save to fetch and carry for her charge. But the Honourable Beatrice could condescend.|$|R
