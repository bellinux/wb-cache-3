This same wide band gene also gives rise to stripeless white tigers. A white tiger that inherits two copies of the recessive wide band gene will be a stripeless white. A normal orange tiger that inherits two copies of the recessive wide band gene will be a golden tabby. The wide band gene is carried independently of the white gene.|$|E

All dogs exhibiting the harlequin pattern are also carriers of the merle gene. Common in Great Danes, (and registered as Harlequin) it is less commonly seen in other breeds such as the Catahoula Leopard Dog, Shetland Sheepdog and Collie, where the dogs are registered simply as merle.|$|E

40|$|The mouse {{alpha-fetoprotein}} gene {{is activated}} in embryonic {{development in the}} visceral endoderm of the extraembryonic yolk sac and the fetal liver and gut. Transcription of the gene is subsequently repressed in the neonatal liver. To ask whether the DNA sequence elements required for tissue-specific activation are the same or different from those required for postnatal developmental regulation of the <b>gene,</b> <b>modified</b> copies of the alpha-fetoprotein gene were microinjected into fertilized mouse eggs. Those animals which developed to term and carried integrated copies of the <b>modified</b> <b>gene</b> were analyzed for expression. In approximately 50 % of such animals, the introduced gene was active only in the three cell lineages which expressed the authentic alpha-fetoprotein gene. Furthermore, its expression was repressed in the neonatal liver. Thus, we conclude that the <b>modified</b> <b>genes,</b> which included either 7 or 14 kilobase pairs of 5 '-flanking DNA, contained the DNA sequence information to direct both tissue-specific expression and developmental regulation. The observation that 50 % of the mice which carried the <b>modified</b> <b>gene</b> did not express it in any tissue, combined {{with the fact that}} the level of expression was highly variable between expressing transgenic animals, suggested that the gene was susceptible to its site of integration in the mouse genome...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{disorders}} affecting speech, learning, and behavior have a 3 : 1 or greater male:female ratio. This has usually been explained {{on the basis}} of a developmental model postulating a difference in the young male versus female brain. Tourette syndrome is a hereditary neurobehavioral disorder due to a single major autosomal gene. It is associated with learning disorders and attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity and shows a similar predilection for males. Because of the more obvious nature of the tics and vocal noises, it is uniquely suited for examining an alternative hypothesis of an X-linked <b>modifying</b> <b>gene</b> to account for the increased incidence in males. Two alternative models tested were an autosomal <b>modifying</b> <b>gene</b> and the developmental model. Family pedigrees on a series of 430 consecutive cases of Tourette syndrome with 966 age-corrected offspring were used to compare the observed affected and unaffected sons and daughters for nine different phenotype matings with the expected ratios for three different models. The X-linked modifier model provided a better fit to the observed data and accounted for marked differences in the percentage of affected sons and daughters when the father versus the mother transmitted the Tourette syndrome gene. A similar model may account for the male predominance in other genetically influenced disorders of speech, learning, and behavior...|$|E

40|$|Mutations of the APC gene cause {{familial}} adenomatous polyposis (FAP) {{in humans}} and multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min) in laboratory mouse strains. A dominant <b>modifying</b> <b>gene</b> (Mom 1), which partially suppresses the min phenotype, has been mapped to mouse chromosome 4. This region is syntenic with human chromosome 1 p 35 -p 36. The phospholipase A 2 (Pla 2 s) locus is an excellent candidate for Mom 1 and the equivalent human locus PLA 2 G 2 A is found on chromosome 1 p 35. It does not necessarily follow, however, than any modifier of mouse polyposis also influences human disease. In order to test whether a locus on 1 p modifies FAP, subjects from 28 FAP families have been typed at microsatellite loci on this chromosome arm. The severity of their duodenal polyposis has also been assessed by endoscopy. Pedigree (lod score) linkage analysis {{found no evidence of}} a simple, dominant <b>modifying</b> <b>gene,</b> comparable with the action of Mom 1 in inbred mouse strains.
