Of 17 C. gattii isolates, 13 (76. 5) were <b>molecular</b> <b>type</b> VGI, and 4 (23. 5) were <b>molecular</b> <b>type</b> VGII. A difference was noted when comparing the <b>molecular</b> <b>types</b> of cryptococcal isolates {{in the earlier}} and recent cases of cryptococcosis. While both <b>molecular</b> <b>types</b> VNI and VGI were equally predominant in the earlier cases of cryptococcosis, VNI was the most predominant <b>molecular</b> <b>type</b> isolated from the recent cases. VNII was a new <b>molecular</b> <b>type,</b> isolated from 5. 1 of the recent cases. All the bird dropping isolates were <b>molecular</b> <b>type</b> VNI. The genetic heterogeneity of the two predominant <b>molecular</b> <b>types,</b> i. e., VNI, VGI clinical isolates and bird dropping isolates of C. neoformans were further determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fingerprinting method, using (GTG) (5) as single primer. Two clusters of cryptococcal isolates were distinguished at 68. 5 of similarity, with cluster I consisting of VNI isolates and cluster II consisting of VGI isolates. Each cluster was further subdivided into three subtypes at >= 80 of similarity. Fourteen bird dropping isolates were grouped into a subtype within VN 1, sharing 82. 7 of similarity with the clinical isolates. A higher degree of similarities, ranging from 93. 4 - 97. 6 was noted between 3 bird dropping isolates with the clinical isolates in another subtype.

To enable a rapid identification of the major <b>molecular</b> <b>types</b> and potential hybrids within the two species specific probes based on the PLB 1 gene in combination with hyperbranched rolling circle amplification (HRCA) were developed.

50|$|To {{test for}} {{histocompatibility}} between {{donor and recipient}} tissues, medical professionals or medical laboratories specifically will be comparing the antibodies of the recipient {{as well as the}} donor. The presence of specific anti-HLA antibodies indicates the presence of the corresponding MHC protein. One common technique used for histocompatibility testing is microcytotoxicity assays. This involves adding a sample of the donor or recipient's cells containing MHC proteins to a serum containing known anti-HLA antibodies. The antibodies that bind to the cells activate a complement signaling cascade resulting in cell lysis. When a particular cell is lysed it will take up an added dye such as trypan blue allowing for identification. Histocompatibility testing has evolved greatly with the technological advances in DNA based <b>molecular</b> <b>typing</b> and solid phase immunoassays, which enable detection of very small amounts of HLA specific antibodies within an individual. This has produced a major challenge for transplant teams as it is still unclear whether or not such small concentrations of antibodies are clinically relevant. Histocompatibility testing {{is only one of many}} criteria necessary for matching transplant donors to recipients. Currently certain MHC proteins, DR, HLA-B, and HLA-A are known to have more of a negative affect and must be the same between tissues in order for a transplant team to proceed. Blood type, age, and overall health are also taken into consideration. These criteria are different across the globe - in Europe, the Histocompatibility threshold of older patients is different as a result of several studies stating that the immune response of older transplant patients towards MHC proteins is slower and therefore less compatibility is necessary for positive results.|$|E

While <b>molecular</b> <b>typing</b> is already used extensively as a tool for TB control in many diverse populations across the globe, the sensitivity of molecular typing-based measures to characteristics of both the host and microbial populations is not well understood. To better characterize the relationship between key host and microbial factors and the validity of <b>molecular</b> <b>typing</b> measures, this dissertation work employs a multi-disciplinary research strategy which integrates molecular, epidemiologic, and computer-simulation data. In the rural, stable population of Arkansas, we found that a declining incidence of TB between 1996 and 2003 resulted primarily from a declining incidence of TB due to the reactivation of remotely acquired infection, rather than recently acquired infection. This work suggested the influence of a strong cohort effect on disease patterns in this population. A validation study of <b>molecular</b> <b>typing</b> in this same population, in which extensive epidemiologic interview data were compared to <b>molecular</b> <b>typing</b> results, identified a number of host and microbial factors associated with the validity of typing results.

40|$|ABSTRACTINTRODUCTION:Cryptococcosis is an {{invasive}} disease acquired by inhalation of infectious propagules from the environment. Currently, compulsory notification {{of the spread}} of this disease is not required in Colombia. However, reporting of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) /acquired immune deficiency syndrome cases to the National Surveillance System has suggested {{that there is a}} growing population at risk of contracting cryptococcosis. Few studies have described the occurrence of cryptococcosis in Colombia. Therefore, in this study, we examined the pathology of this disease in Atlántico, Colombia and determined the distributions of Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii in the environment. METHODS:Clinical samples/isolates were gathered from cases of cryptococcosis previously diagnosed at health institutions in Atlántico, and surveys were completed by clinicians. The environmental study considered 32 sampling points and three tree species, i. e., Quickstick (Gliricidia sepium), Almond (Terminalia catappa), and Pink trumpet (Tabebuia rosea). Environmental and clinical samples/isolates were analyzed for phenotypic and genotypic confirmation. RESULTS:From 1997 - 2014, 41 cases of cryptococcosis were reported. The mean patient age was 40. 5 years (range: 18 - 63 years); 76 % were men, and 78 % were HIV positive. Isolation was possible in 38 cases (C. neoformans, <b>molecular</b> <b>type</b> VNI in 37 cases and C. gattii, <b>molecular</b> <b>type</b> VGI in one case).

Among 177 chickens, 41 (23 %) yielded campylobacter isolates; of these, 19 (46 %) had genotypes similar to those of 41 (22 %) human isolates. However, a temporal association was demonstrated in only a minority of cases, and most genotypes were present only in a single species, suggesting that sources other than chickens are important in human campylobacteriosis. Further investigation with samples from water and other possible environmental sources is needed to define the most efficient strategy for the application of <b>molecular</b> <b>typing</b> and identification of the source(s) of sporadic cases of campylobacteriosis...|$|E
40|$|Cryptococcosis is a {{fungal disease}} {{affecting}} {{more than one}} million people per year worldwide. The main etiological agents of cryptococcosis are the two sibling species Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii that present numerous differences in geographical distribution, ecological niches, epidemiology, pathobiology, clinical presentation and molecular characters. Genotyping of the two Cryptococcus species at subspecies level supplies relevant information to understand how this fungus has spread worldwide, the nature of its population structure, and how it evolved to be a deadly pathogen. At present, nine major <b>molecular</b> <b>types</b> have been recognized: VNI, VNII, VNB, VNIII, and VNIV among C. neoformans isolates, and VGI, VGII, VGIII, and VGIV among C. gattii isolates. In this paper all the information available in the literature concerning the isolation of the two Cryptococcus species has been collected and analyzed {{on the basis of their}} geographical origin, source of isolation, level of identification, species, and <b>molecular</b> <b>type.</b> A detailed analysis of the geographical distribution of the major <b>molecular</b> <b>types</b> in each continent has been described and represented on thematic maps. This study represents a useful tool to start new epidemiological surveys on the basis of the present knowledge...|$|R
40|$|The {{first year}} of this effort was {{focussed}} on the following broad objectives: (1) Analyze the <b>molecular</b> <b>types</b> present in shale oil (as a function of molecular weight distribution); (2) Determine the behavior of these <b>molecular</b> <b>types</b> in liquid-liquid extraction; (3) Develop the analytical tools needed to systematize the process development; (4) Survey the markets to assure that these have high value uses for the types found in shale oil; (5) Explore selective process means for extracting/converting shale oil components into concentrates of potentially marketable components; (6) Compile overview of the venture development strategy and begin implementation of that strategy. Each of these tasks has been completed in sufficient detail that we can now focus on filling in the knowledge gaps evident from the overview...|$|R

Although most cases of infection in the world are caused by C. neoformans, there is an important prevalence of C. gattii among clinical and veterinary samples in Australia 2 – 4 and the natural habitat of the yeast is strongly associated with native Eucalyptus spe-cies 4, 5, which together position Australia as an endemic area for the less common cryptococcal species.
