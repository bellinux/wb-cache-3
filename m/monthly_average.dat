In Shanghai, 20streets were flooded and hundreds of homes were flooded with water. At nearby Hongquiao Airport, an Airbus A340 bound for Paris slipped off the runway. Though no people were injured, the airport was closed for eight hours. The typhoon also caused the Huangpu River to rise to its third highest level in recorded history.|$|E

25|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defined {{secondary}} treatment {{based on the}} performance observed at late 20th-century bioreactors treating typical United States municipal sewage. Secondary treated sewage is expected to produce effluent with a <b>monthly</b> <b>average</b> of less than 30mg/l BOD and less than 30mg/l suspended solids. Weekly averages may be up to 50 percent higher. A sewage treatment plant providing both primary and {{secondary treatment}} is expected to remove at least 85 percent of the BOD and suspended solids from domestic sewage. The EPA regulations describe stabilization ponds as providing treatment equivalent to secondary treatment removing 65 percent of the BOD and suspended solids from incoming sewage and discharging approximately 50 percent higher effluent concentrations than modern bioreactors. The regulations also recognize the difficulty of meeting the specified removal percentages from combined sewers, dilute industrial wastewater, or Infiltration/Inflow.|$|E

25|$|Chennai Port lies {{on a flat}} {{coastal plain}} known as the Eastern Coastal Plains {{on the east coast}} of the Indian {{peninsula}} known as the Coromandel Coast in the Bay of Bengal. The bed slope is fairly flat. The port is situated on the thermal equator and is also coastal, which prevents extreme variation in seasonal temperature. The climate is tropical, specifically tropical wet and dry, and for most of the year, the weather is hot and humid, with temperatures ranging from a maximum of 42°C in May to a minimum of 18°C in January. The mean minimum temperature is 18°C in January and 26.8°C in May. The mean highest temperature is 29.3°C in December and 39.6°C in May. The port gets most of its seasonal rainfall from the northeast monsoon winds, from mid-September to mid-December. Occasionally, cyclones in the Bay of Bengal hit the coast. The average annual rainfall in the region is about 1298.11mm, with 443.5mm during southwest monsoon (June–September), 753.1mm during northeast monsoon (October–December), 37.3mm during winter season (January–February) and 64.2mm during hot weather (March–May). The <b>monthly</b> <b>average</b> varies from 7mm in April to 308mm in November. Humidity ranges from 63 to 83 percent during January–March, from 57 to 72 percent during April–June and from 70 to 81 percent during October–December.|$|E
25|$|A {{comparison}} of GOES-12 satellite images shows {{the distribution of}} atmospheric water vapor relative to the oceans, clouds and continents of the Earth. Vapor surrounds the planet but is unevenly distributed. The image loop on the right shows <b>monthly</b> <b>average</b> of water vapor content with the units are given in centimeters, which is the precipitable water or equivalent amount of water that could be produced if all the water vapor in the column were to condense. The lowest amounts of water vapor (0 centimeters) appear in yellow, and the highest amounts (6 centimeters) appear in dark blue. Areas of missing data appear in shades of gray. The maps are based on data collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on NASA's Aqua satellite. The most noticeable pattern in the time series is the influence of seasonal temperature changes and incoming sunlight on water vapor. In the tropics, a band of extremely humid air wobbles {{north and south of}} the equator as the seasons change. This band of humidity is part of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, where the easterly trade winds from each hemisphere converge and produce near-daily thunderstorms and clouds. Farther from the equator, water vapor concentrations are high in the hemisphere experiencing summer and low in the one experiencing winter. Another pattern that shows up in the time series is that water vapor amounts over land areas decrease more in winter months than adjacent ocean areas do. This is largely because air temperatures over land drop more in the winter than temperatures over the ocean. Water vapor condenses more rapidly in colder air.|$|E
