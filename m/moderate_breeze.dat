In Guadeloupe, the storm dropped rain across southern Basse-Terre Island through August1415; a peak total of 9.02in (229mm) was recorded at the summit of La Grande Soufrière. Wind gusts at Raizet Airport reached 38mph (61km/h), just below tropical storm force. <b>Moderate</b> <b>breeze</b> embedded with gusts to 28mph (44km/h) brushed Dominica, and 1.25in (32mm) of rain fell at Canefield Airport within 24hours of Cindy's passage. Further south, a weather station in Saint Lucia recorded 1.88in (48mm) of precipitation, as well as light winds. As Cindy passed south of the Virgin Islands, unsettled seas and minor beach erosion affected the islands' southern shores, with swells of 4 to 5ft (1.2 to 1.5m) reported at Saint Croix. Onshore, the island experienced wind gusts to 35mph (55km/h) and 1.48 in (38mm) of rainfall.|$|E

Four single-engine air tankers were deployed to control the Merivale fire.|$|R

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper Fleschner et al. (1956) review the {{literature}} on dispersal of tetranychid mites by air currents and present the results of original research on these four species: Metatetranychns citri (McGregor), the citrus red mite; Oligonychuspunicae (Hirst), the avocado brown mite; Eotetranychussexmaculatus (Riley), the six-spotted mite; and Tetranychus telarius (L.), the two-spotted spider mite. These authors found that the first three species listed above behaved similarly in regard to dissemination by air currents. As mite populations on infested trees reached high levels or peaks, large numbers of adult females were observed to spin down from leaves and hang freely suspended in air, each by a single silken filament. The mites were then disengaged from the trees and dispersed by gentle to <b>moderate</b> <b>breezes,</b> often to heights {{much greater than the}} trees, with the silken filaments presumably acting much like parachutes and imparting considerable lift to the mites.

60|$|The {{next three}} days were spent in flying the other kites, tying them on the boats, {{acquiring}} experience, and making preparations for the voyage. It was found that, with a <b>moderate</b> <b>breeze,</b> the kites towed the boats {{at the rate of}} ten miles an hour, which was beyond the most sanguine hopes of the Captain. Of course they could not beat to windward with them, but they could sail with a considerable slant, and they prevented the boats, while thus advancing, from making much leeway by means of deep leeboards, such as are used even at the present day by Dutch ships.|$|E

50|$|The Pacific Coast Campus is {{situated}} {{north of the}} Pacific Coast Highway, bordered by Orange Avenue to the west, Walnut Avenue to the east, and Mary Butler School to the north. Year round, there is a mild climate <b>moderated</b> by ocean <b>breezes</b> from the Pacific.|$|R
60|$|The {{wide and}} gently {{inclined}} plain, thus inclosed between {{the gulf and}} the highlands, on each side and at its upper extremity, is distinguishable into two regions of very different character, one of which lies north, and the other south of the parallel of Hit, on the Euphrates. Except {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the river, the northern division is stony and scantily covered with vegetation, except in spring. Over the southern division, on the contrary, spreads a deep alluvial soil, in which even a pebble is rare; and which, though, under the existing misrule, mainly a waste of marsh and wilderness, needs only intelligent attention to become, as it was of old, the granary of western Asia. Except in the extreme south, the rainfall is small and the air dry. The heat in summer is intense, while bitterly cold northern blasts sweep the plain in winter. Whirlwinds are not uncommon; and, in the intervals of the periodical inundations, the fine, dry, powdery soil is swept, even by <b>moderate</b> <b>breezes,</b> into stifling clouds, or rather fogs, of dust. Low inequalities, elevations here and depressions there, diversify the surface of the alluvial region. The latter are occupied by enormous marshes, while the former support the permanent dwellings of the present scanty and miserable population.|$|R
60|$|This {{would not}} have been {{difficult}} in a <b>moderate</b> <b>breeze,</b> but the wind was blowing furiously and the schooner was greatly pressed with sail. He thought of calling the others to lower the mainsail peak, but with the weight of wind there was in the canvas he was not sure that they could haul down the gaff. Besides, they were busy securing the boat, which must be made fast again before they hove the other in, and it was almost dark now. In view of what had happened in the same waters one night, four years before, the desire to pick up the boat while there was a little light left became an obsession.|$|E
60|$|The {{change in}} the course of the vessel was by no means {{appreciated}} by the passengers, for the motion was very much rougher and more unpleasant than that to which they had now become accustomed. However, by the following morning the wind had died away to a <b>moderate</b> <b>breeze,</b> and the sea had very sensibly abated. The topsails were shaken out of their reefs; and although the motion was still violent most of the passengers emerged from their cabins and came on deck to enjoy the sun, which was now streaming brightly through the broken clouds. The captain was in high glee; the ship had weathered the gale without the slightest damage. Not a rope had parted, not a sail been blown away, and the result fully justified the confidence he felt in his ship and her gear.|$|E
6000|$|It was the Skyeman, {{who often}} admonished me to [...] "heave the ship to" [...] every night, thus {{stopping}} her headway till morning; a plan which, under other circumstances, might have perhaps warranted the slumbers of all. But as it was, {{such a course}} would have been highly imprudent. For while making no onward progress through the water, the rapid currents we encountered would continually be drifting us eastward; since, contrary to our previous experience, they seemed latterly to have reversed their flow, a phenomenon by no means unusual {{in the vicinity of}} the Line in the Pacific. And this it was that so prolonged our passage to the westward. Even in a <b>moderate</b> <b>breeze,</b> I sometimes fancied, that the impulse of the wind little more than counteracted the glide of the currents; so that with much show of sailing, we were in reality almost a fixture on the sea.|$|E

I went into the main-top, and examined her with a glass. She was a ship, seemingly of about our own size, and carrying everything that would draw.
