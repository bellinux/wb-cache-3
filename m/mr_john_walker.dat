He said some praiseful things about the character of the club and the orderly serenity and pleasantness of its quarters, and asked if I had never tried to acquire membership in it. I said I had not, and that New York clubs were a continuous expense to the country members without being of frequent use or benefit to them.|$|R

5000|$|Castle Oliver a.k.a. Clonodfoy/Clonghanodfoy Castle, Co.Limerick, Ireland (1845-52) Scottish Baronial; also {{commissioned}} by the Oliver Gascoigne sisters, it is a 110-room private residence with 2 matching gate lodges built of pink sandstone quarried locally. It featured Minton encaustic tiles and stained glass, as well as decorative ceilings, all designed by the sisters. The stonework was built by Thos. H Carroll of Dublin; Messrs. Henry & Thos. Creaser, of York, were the contractors for the interior finishings; Johnston Silley & Co, Decorator, Dublin, executed the decorative paintwork (still being completed in 1857) & <b>Mr</b> <b>John</b> <b>Walker,</b> of Walker Iron Foundry, York, supplied all the ironwork of the roof, etc. [...] Monograms of Carroll and Creaser, the 2 main contractors, feature in a decorative terracotta panel set high in the gable overlooking the courtyard. See examples of this and other features: http://www.castle-oliver.com/Pages/Pics/Original-features.html Jones designed large stone gryphons, 11 of which sat on the balustrade surrounding the castle. These were probably carved from Portland Stone and disintegrated in the wet Irish climate in the early 20th century. Facsimiles have recently been created from photographic evidence and a limited edition made available http://www.triton.uk.com/index.php/showcase/commission-for-castle-oliver-in-ireland/. Small scale plans signed by Jones and dated 24 June 1845 are in the Manuscripts Room at Dublin Library. The castle is remarkable for its simple, but immensely effective and durable cast & wrought iron roof trusses, which were made in numbered component form in York and assembled on site. These trusses {{are believed to have}} been relatively 'cutting edge' at the time, although it appears that Walker Iron Foundry made similar ones in 1843 to restore the Nave roof of York Minster. Castle Oliver and its main lodge featured in 'The Builder' Journal of 23 November 1850; Vol. 8, No.407, pp 558 & 559, (with descriptive text at foot of p559) http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ilej/image1.pl?item=page&seq=1&size=1&id=bu.1850.11.x.8.x.x.558 http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ilej/image1.pl?item=page&seq=1&size=1&id=bu.1850.11.x.8.x.x.559, with beautifully etched pictures (sadly these reproductions are low quality).
