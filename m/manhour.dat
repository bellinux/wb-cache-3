40|$|Graduation date: 1978 The {{change in}} {{emphasis}} from tractor and highlead logging systems to the advanced logging systems of skyline, balloon, and helicopter has stirred researchers {{to study the}} operations of the advanced systems. The extra work involved in preparing an area for contract timber removal using advanced logging systems, however, has not been studied. The impacts of the extra time and extra manpower required for this process are large and they are important impacts which need to be taken into consideration during crew work planning. This is difficult to do since the factors which affect crew <b>manhours</b> have not been defined. The objectives of this paper are to determine which factors affect the number of <b>manhours</b> spent on the presale fieldwork portion of preparing a U. S. D. A. Forest Service timber sale for contract; to compare presale field work time on conventional and special-design sales; and to develop a methodology for predicting presale fieldwork time. Previous studies suggest some factors which affect forestry work, but the quantitative changes in production caused by each factor have not been measured. Logging operation research and human engineering studies report that the following factors affect production: underbrush, topography, weather, heat, cold, muscle fatigue, motivation, the work-rest period, tobacco, and alcohol. Motivation is often an overriding factor which outweighs all other considerations. Motivation was not measured in this study, but it was expected to have some effect on the results. Topography, underbrush, and weather were expected {{to be the most important}} variables for predicting <b>manhours.</b> Data or presale fieldwork time were collected from 16 districts on eight National Forests in Oregon and Washington, using a form designed to simplify data collection and coding for computer input. The form was a daily work record which could be easily filled out in a few minutes by the field crew. District personnel on each of the 16 districts were personally contacted about cooperating in the study, but they were not pressured to collect data even if they agreed to cooperate. The sample was designed to collect a distribution of data from the coast, eastside, and Cascade areas respectively, but most data collected came from the Cascade area. Activity categories for data collection included layout, traverse, marking,cruising, skyline profile, wildlife related activity, land line retracement, spur road traverse, spur road location, and timber stand examination. The data were separated by activity and by complete units, and were analyzed using a stepwise multiple regression program. Variables found to increase the number of <b>manhours</b> required for presale fieldwork were acres, boundary sinuosity, and silvicultural treatment. The significant variables which reduced <b>manhours</b> were landscape management designation and the distance walked from the vehicle to the unit. These two variables had been expected to increase <b>manhours,</b> but the effect of motivation may have been the cause for the unexpected reverse of sign on the regression coefficients. Special design designation showed no significant effect on <b>manhours</b> except through boundary sinuosity. The regression equations recommended for use in predicting <b>manhours</b> are for the activities of layout using on-the-ground aerial photo-interpretation; traverse using a hand compass, clinometer, and chain; marking of leave trees; cruising by the variable plot method; and for the Cascade area complete units.

Therefore, uniformity of compression pressure and valve timing became one of most important engine design and production standard. Conventional method to evaluate compression pressure uniformity is to measure each cylinder pressure by mechanical pressure gage during cranking. This conventional method causes inaccuracy of cylinder pressure measurement because of different cranking speed results from battery status and also causes high <b>manhour</b> and cost. To check valve timing, related FEAD parts should be disassembled and timing mark should be checked manually.

40|$|Takt {{time and}} LBMS are getting {{increased}} attention from practitioners of Lean Construction. The takt time approach focusses on designing work locations with similar quantities and plans {{on the same}} duration for each task without any buffers. To achieve level resource utilization takt time projects require substantial work backlog tasks or locations to absorb periods of low production demand. The LBMS approach plans on using consistent resources through all the locations. Buffers are added to absorb the risk of deviations and durations are allowed to vary based on quantity of work. This results in significantly longer schedules but decreases the need for workable backlog areas {{and the risk of}} demobilizations. To compare these two methods, three schedules planned with LBMS methodology were reformed into takt time schedules by forcing each task to have the same duration in each location. This was achieved by changing the crew size in each location to achieve a duration shorter than or equal to the takt time. Theresulting schedules were compared in terms of total project duration, total project <b>manhours</b> and the risk of duration and <b>manhours</b> evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation. The results indicate that takt time achieves substantially shorter schedules but the <b>manhours</b> required in work backlog areas are much higher than in LBMS approach. In projects where quantities are similar between locations, takt time performs well if the resources are not demobilized when they run out of work. If the resources demobilize, the risk of return delays makes takt time a risky strategy. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with labour productivity in traditional house building in Scotland. Productivity {{is a measure of}} the effective use of resources and provides vital benefits that can be combined in a number of ways. The introduction gives the background to two Scottish house building sites (Blantyre and Greenfield) that were surveyed by the Building Research Establishment (BEE) activity sampling method to provide the data for the study. The study had two main objectives; (1) summary data analysis in average <b>manhours</b> per house between all the houses on the site, and (2) detailed data analysis in average <b>manhours</b> for each house block on the site. The introduction also provides a literature review related to the objectives. The method is outlined in Chapter 2, the sites are discussed in Chapter 3, and Chapter 4 covers the method application on each site and a method development made in the study. The summary data analysis (Chapter 5) compares Blantyre and Greenfield, and two previous BEE surveys in England. The main detailed data analysis consisted of three forms, (Chapters 6, 7 and 8) each applied to a set of operations. The three forms of analysis were variations in average <b>manhours</b> per house for each house block on the site compared with; (1) block construction order, (2) average number of separate visits per house made by operatives to each block to complete an operation, and (3) average number of different operatives per house employed on an operation in each block. Three miscellaneous items of detail data analysis are discussed in Chapter 9. The conclusions to the whole study state that considerable variations in <b>manhours</b> for repeated operations were discovered, that the numbers of visits by operatives to complete operations were large and that the numbers of different operatives employed in some operations were a factor related to productivity. A critique of the activity sampling method suggests that the data produced is reliable in summary form and can give a good context for more detailed data collection. For future work, this could take the form of selected operations, with the context of an activity sampling survey, that wuld be intensively surveyed by other methods...|$|R

40|$|First paragraph: This paper {{attempts}} {{to show the}} importance of the work on cyclical <b>manhour</b> variation, pioneered by Oi (1962), Rosen (1968), Nadiri and Rosen (1969), (1974 a) and (1974 b)) and Ehrenberg (1971), towards understanding the observed short-run relationships between nominal wage changes and unemployment. The focal point for the inflation analysis is the Phillips curve derivation of Barro and Grossman (1976) and Grossman (1974) since their approach of denning excess demand in terms of manhours provides a crucial link between employment and inflation theories. While the general Barro and Grossman macroeconomic system (see also (1971)) represents an extreme case within the class of non-market clearing models, given its arbitrary fixed price assumption, its use here, apart from convenience, is defended for two reasons. First, the adoption of a more sophisticated non-market clearing model incorporating an explicit price adjustment equation would not alter the main arguments substantively. Secondly, although the applicability of the Barro and Grossman methodology was originally questioned, since it left unexplained why prices may fail to clear markets, more recent work on price adjustment has helped to give a firmer foundation to this approach (see Gordon (1981)) ...|$|E

It is expected that control actions are taken in response to adverse forecasts to prevent the forecasted problems from happening on site.

In this research, forecasts from two hospital construction projects were evaluated for accuracy. Tasks were selected for analysis based on their <b>manhour</b> count, availability of accurate resource data and full completion of the operation. Forecasts were reviewed at four dates during performance of each task. The forecast on each date was compared to actual progress on these four dates. Results show that certain deviations such as working out of sequence, not finishing locations or working in several locations at the same time severely impact the forecasting ability of LBMS and make the project schedules unpredictable.

A number of work streams {{have been set up}} to consider such areas from a technical and economic standpoint. The use of small helium additions has particular benefits and despite an increase in unit cost, the overriding benefits are achieved in reduced <b>manhour</b> cost.

Overlaid on these has been the increasing use of a technique that visualises actual gas flow during welding by the use of laser backlighting. Some preliminary work in this area is described particularly related to the effect of drafts on the gas distribution.

Pacific Fleet's (COMNAVSURFPAC) Supply Maintenance Training Team (SMTT). The effectiveness of the SMIT program is also evaluated. Data were gathered from surveys of current and former Supply Officers of COMNAVSURFPAC ships, with the Shipboard Non-tactical Automated Data Processing II system installed and which had received all or part of an SMTT assistance visit. Interviews were conducted with selected Navy and civilian contractor members of the SMTT staff. Data were also gathered from various records and reports maintained by the SMTT staff and by COMNAVSURFPAC's Supply Assistance Center. The nature of the cost/benefit data of the SMTT program did not lend itself to a homogenous comparison of costs to benefits. The authors have determined that an attempt to "homogenize" the data with the use of economic "shadow prices" was of little value in meeting the "measurable performance" criteria of the cost/benefit analysis. Therefore, in strict terms, a cost/effectiveness analysis was accomplished. The analysis indicated that the SMTT program has resulted in positive gains in afloat supply operations. Many intangible benefits are derived from the assistance visit and there are indications of tangible benefits in the form of dollar and <b>manhour</b> savings. The trend of the data shows a valuable program to the fleet. Although not definitive due to data limitations, the analysis indicates a high probability that the benefits of operations of the different SMTT components exceed the costs in varying degrees.

40|$|The Modular Pebble Bed Reactor {{is a small}} high {{temperature}} helium cooled reactor that is being considered for both electric power and hydrogen production. Pebble bed reactors are being developed in South Africa, China and the US. To make smaller 120 Mwe reactors economically competitive with larger 1500 Mwe traditional light water reactors {{changes in the way}} these plants are built are needed. Economies of production need to be sufficiently large to compete with economies of scale. MIT (Berte) has been working on developing a modular design and construction strategy for several years. This thesis builds on that work by demonstrating the technical feasibility of implementing the modularity approaches previously developed. The MIT approach uses "space frames" containing all the components, piping, valves and needed cables, instrumentation in a specified volume. These space frames are built in a factory to assure high quality in manufacture. They are then shipped by train or truck to the site and assembled "lego" style. It is expected that with the improved quality in the factory setting, and rapid assembly at the site that the total time and cost of construction of the plant will be greatly reduced (Kadak). To make this process work, it is vitally important to assure that when the space frames and internal components are manufactured, they are done to rigid tolerances to assure line up when assembled in the field. By using many advanced three dimensional measurement technologies, including the use of digital photography, lasers, and photogrammetry, companies are now capable of fabricating pieces to extremely precise specifications at a relatively affordable cost. This thesis evaluates the feasibility of manufacture of space frames and internal components to the required tolerances, the accuracy control needed and how the plant can be assembled with details of each space frame interfaces. (cont.) A global reference system was determined and a basic plant map for space frame placement developed. Deviations from exact placement from this map due to tolerance allowances were factored in and methods and techniques for overcoming any variations was developed. In order to enable each frame and it's respective components to be accurately fabricated to ensure interfacing parts will mate, a local coordinate system was developed for each frame and used to describe the exact location of the required interfaces for each specific frame. Crucial concepts of accuracy control and "best fit" are outlined and incorporated. Based on independent verification of the processes and the design proposed, this modularity approach appears to be feasible. A comparative economic analysis was also performed to assess the potential cost savings of the modularity approach compared to traditional "stick build" approaches presently being used in nuclear construction. <b>Manhour,</b> learning curve and overall cost savings of over 30 % can be expected which suggests that if modularity approaches as those proposed are used, smaller reactors can compete with larger economies of scale plants. by Jaime E.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} factor subsidies on capital formation and employment in an OLG small open economy model of wealth accumulation. Two cases are explored, one with neoclassical wages and one with incentive-wages. We show that in the neoclassical model a capital subsidy spurs capital and causes a temporary increase in <b>manhours</b> which vanishes in the long-run, while a labor subsidy may temporarily increase inputs, but is neutral for steady state capital and labor. In the incentive-wage economy, a capital subsidy boosts investment and aggravates unemployment, while a labor subsidy stimulates employment and will in some conditions depress capital formation...|$|R
