40|$|During {{the present}} study the Ivory Coast <b>microtektite</b> layer was found in cores from five {{equatorial}} Atlantic sites, bringing {{the total number of}} Ivory Coast microtektite-bearing cores to eleven. The strewn field appears to be restricted to between 9 °N and 12 °S latitude. There is a general increase in the concentration of microtektites towards the Bosumtwi crater, which is generally thought to be the source of the Ivory Coast tektites. The relationship between the onset of the Jaramillo subchron and the Ivory Coast <b>microtektite</b> layer has been investigated in six cores. A plot of the difference in depth between the base of the Jaramillo subchron and the <b>microtektite</b> layer versus sediment accumulation rate was used to determine the average post-depositional remanent magnetization (PDRM) acquisition depth and the age difference between the onset of the Jaramillo subchron and the deposition of the microtektites. Assuming that the PDRM acquisition depth does not vary with sediment accumulation rate, we find that the average PDRM acquisition depth is 7 cm and that the microtektites were deposited approximately 8 ky after the onset of the Jaramillo subchron. This indicates that the impact responsible for the Ivory Coast tektites and microtektites could not be causally related to the geomagnetic reversal {{at the base of the}} Jaramillo subchron...|$|E
40|$|An {{iridium anomaly}} {{has been found}} in {{coincidence}} with the known <b>microtektite</b> level in cores from Deep Sea Drilling Project site 149 in the Caribbean Sea. The iridium was probably not in the microtektites but deposited simultaneously with them; this could occur if the iridium was deposited from a dust cloud resulting from a bolide impact, as suggested for the anomaly associated with the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. Other workers have deduced that the microtektites are part of the North American strewn tektite field, which is dated at about 34 million years before present, and that the <b>microtektite</b> horizon in deep-sea cores is synchronous with the extinction of five radiolarian species.

40|$|We {{extended}} the petrographic and geochemical dataset for the recently discovered Transantarctic Mountain <b>microtektites</b> {{in order to}} check our previous claim that they {{are related to the}} Australasian strewn field. Based on color and composition, the 465 <b>microtektites</b> so far identified include two groups of transparent glass spheres less than ca. 800 µm in diameter: the most abundant pale-yellow, or normal, <b>microtektites,</b> and the rare pale-green, or high-Mg, <b>microtektites.</b> The major element composition of normal <b>microtektites</b> determined through electron microprobe analysis is characterized by high contents of silica (SiO 2 = 71. 5 ± 3. 6 (1 sigma) wt%) and alumina (Al 2 O 3 = 15. 5 ± 2. 2 (1 sigma) wt%), low total alkali element contents (0. 50 - 1. 85 wt%), and MgO abundances 10 wt%. Transantarctic Mountain <b>microtektites</b> contain rare silica-rich (up to 93 wt% SiO 2) glassy inclusions similar to those found in two Australasian <b>microtektites</b> analyzed here for comparison. These inclusions are interpreted as partially digested, lechatelierite-like inclusions typically found in tektites and <b>microtektites.</b> The major and trace element (by laser ablation - inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry) abundance pattern of the Transantarctic Mountain <b>microtektites</b> matches the average upper continental crust composition for most elements. Major deviations include a strong to moderate depletion in volatile elements including Pb, Zn, Na, K, Rb, Sr and Cs, as a likely result of severe volatile loss during the high temperature melting and vaporization of crustal target rocks. The normal and high-Mg Transantarctic Mountain <b>microtektites</b> have compositions similar to the most volatile-poor normal and high-Mg Australasian <b>microtektites</b> reported in the literature. Their very low H 2 O and B contents (by secondary ion mass spectrometry) of 85 ± 58 (1 sigma) ?g/g and 0. 53 ± 0. 21 ?g/g, respectively, evidence the extreme volatile loss characteristically observed in tektites. The Sr and Nd isotopic compositions of multigrain samples of Transantarctic Mountain <b>microtektites</b> are 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ~ 0. 71629 and 143 Nd/ 144 Nd ~ 0. 51209, and fall into the Australasian tektite compositional field. The Nd model age calculated with respect to the chondritic uniform reservoir (CHUR) is TNdCHUR ~ 1. 1 Ga, indicating a Meso-Proterozoic crustal source rock, as was derived for Australasian tektites as well. Coupled with the Quaternary age from the literature, the extended dataset presented in this work strengthens our previous conclusion that Transantarctic Mountain <b>microtektites</b> represent a major southward extension of the Australasian tektite/microtektite strewn field. Furthermore, the significant depletion in volatile elements (i. e., Pb, B, Na, K, Zn, Rb, Sr and Cs) of both normal and high-Mg Transantarctic Mountain <b>microtektites</b> relative to the Australasian ones provide us with further confirmation of a possible relationship between high temperature-time regimes in the microtektite-forming process and ejection distance...|$|R

40|$|The Toba lake event, the Australasian <b>microtektite</b> event, and the Cretaceous/Paleogene {{boundary}} {{were analyzed}} {{on the basis}} of foraminifers, carbonate content, trace elements, and spherules (microtektites). The Toba ash event, recovered in Hole 758 C, may have had minor influences on the foraminiferal populations. The Australasian tektite event has probably some influence on foraminiferal ecology, because the larger specimens become scarce just above the <b>microtektite</b> layer. Microtektites recovered from Hole 758 B closely resemble spherules recovered from several Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary localities in North America. The Cretaceous/Paleogene spherules, however, are usually larger and are completely altered to goyazite in the terrestrial environment and to smectite in a marine environment. The Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary of Hole 752 B does not show obvious anomalous trace-element concentrations, and iridium concentrations are below our detection limits.

40|$|Microtektites {{have been}} {{recovered}} from three horizons in eight middle Eocene to middle Oligocene marine sediment sequences. Five of these occurrences are coeval and of latest Eocene age (37. 5 to 38. 0 million years ago); three are coeval and of early late Eocene age (38. 5 to 39. 5 million years ago); and three are of middle Oligocene age (31 to 32 million years ago). In addition, rare probable microtektites {{have been found in}} sediments with ages of about 36. 0 to 36. 5 million years. The <b>microtektite</b> horizon at 37. 5 to 38. 0 million years can be correlated with the North American tektite-strewn field, which has a fission track age (minimum) of 34 to 35 million years and a paleomagnetic age of 37. 5 to 38. 0 million years. There is no evidence for mass faunal extinctions at any of the <b>microtektite</b> horizons. Many of the distinct faunal changes that occurred in the middle Eocene to middle Oligocene can be related to the formation of the Antarctic ice sheet and the associated cooling phenomena and intensification of bottom currents that led to large-scale dissolution of calcium carbonate and erosion, which created areally extensive hiatuses in the deep-sea sediment records. The occurrence of <b>microtektite</b> horizons of several ages and the lack of evidence for faunal extinctions suggest that the effects of extraterrestrial bolide impacts may be unimportant in the biologic realm during middle Eocene to middle Oligocene time...|$|E

A geochemical comparison with Australasian <b>microtektites</b> from deep sea sediments at lower latitudes identifies a possible projectile geochemical signature {{for the first}} time, and confirms that Transantarctic Mountains <b>microtektites</b> experienced higher thermal regimes. Ballistic calculations reveal that the extraordinary distance of the Transantarctic Mountains <b>microtektites</b> from the hypothetical impact location in Indochina (∼ 11, 000 km) could be more efficiently attained at relatively low ejection angles (20 °– 40 °). Finally, the occurrence of Australasian <b>microtektites</b> (∼ 0. 8 Ma old) on specific glacial surfaces of the Antarctic bedrock constrains the glacial history of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet in Victoria Land.

40|$|Recently {{published}} studies of Ocean Drilling Project (ODP) cores from near southeast Asia revealed <b>microtektite</b> contents {{much higher than}} those in previously studied cores, suggesting that Ir contents might be enhanced in the tektite-bearing horizons. We determined a positive Ir anomaly in ODP core 758 B from the Ninetyeast Ridge, eastern Indian Ocean; the peak Ir concentration of 190 pg/ g was ~ 2 X the continuum level. The net Ir fluence is 1. 8 +/- 0. 5 ng/cm** 2 over the depth interval from 10. 87 to 11. 32 m; a small additional peak also associated with microtektites contributes another 0. 5 ng Ir/cm** 2. Concentrations of Ir in core 769 A show more scatter, but a small Ir enhancement {{is associated with the}} peak <b>microtektite</b> abundance; our best estimate of the poorly constrained fluence is 1. 3 +/- 0. 7 ng/cm** 2. Data on deep-sea cores show that the <b>microtektite</b> fluence falls exponentially away from southeast Asia, the fluence dropping a factor of 2 in ~ 400 km. In southeast Asia the trend merges with a roughly estimated mass fluence of ~ 1. 1 g/cm** 2 inferred from evidence of a melt sheet in northeast Thailand. Integration of the inferred distribution yields a total mass of Australasian tektites of 3. 2 x 10 ** 16 g, much higher than previous estimates. Assuming a similar fallout distribution for the impactor and a chondritic composition allows us to calculate its mass to be 1. 5 x 10 ** 15 g, about 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the minimum mass of the impactor responsible for the extinctions {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous...|$|E

40|$|Although post-depositional {{remanent}} magnetization (PDRM) in {{deep-sea sediments}} {{appears to be}} acquired during the earliest stages of sediment compaction, the natural variability of the PDRM lock-in depth in deep-sea sediments is poorly understood and as yet unquantified. Here we consider variations in the relative stratigraphic positions of oxygen isotopic interglacial Stage 19. 1 and the Brunhes-Matuyama (B/M) Chronozone reversal for eight deep-sea sediment cores. Results from a similar study of the displacement between a widespread <b>microtektite</b> layer and the B/M boundary are also included [1]. The PDRM lock-in depth and the temporal relationships between the B/M and Stage 19. 1 datums can be determined from the offsets between the paleomagnetic and the isotopic (and <b>microtektite)</b> stratigraphies. For cores with sedimentation rates greater than 1 cm kyr− 1, the depth offset between the paleomagnetic and isotopic datums is a linear function of sedimentation rate. A simple model (r 2 = 0. 77) demonstrates that (1) PDRM acquisition occurs ∼ 16 cm below the sediment surface, and (2) the B/M reversal occurs 6 kyr (± 2 kyr) after the Stage 19. 1 datum, and the Stage 19. 1 datum occurs 9 kyr (± 3 kyr) after the deposition of the Australasian <b>microtektite</b> strewnfield. This example argues against simple geophysical models linking geomagnetic field reversals to climate change or impact events. The B/M boundary is anomalously deep (30 – 50 cm) in very low accumulation rate sediments (< 1 cm kyr− 1) and this may reflect the unusual physical properties of these sediments. A review of the geotechnical literature suggests that very low accumulation rate sediments have sufficient time to develop enhanced interparticle rigidity (structural strength) which inhibits early compaction and, hence, PDRM acquisition...|$|E

40|$|A {{mechanism}} {{had been}} recently proposed {{to show how}} an impact event can trigger a geomagnetic polarity reversal by means of rapid climate cooling. We test the proposed mechanism by examining the record from two high sedimentation rate (8 - 11 cm/kyr) deep-sea sediment cores (ODP Sites 767 and 769) from marginal seas of the Indonesian archipelago, which record the Australasian impact with well-defined <b>microtektite</b> layers, the Brunhes-Matuyama polarity reversal with strong and stable remanent magnetizations, and global climate with oxygen isotope variations in planktonic foraminifera. Both ODP cores show the impact to have preceded the reversal of magnetic field directions by about 12 kyr. Both records indicate that the field intensity was increasing near the time of impact and that it continued to increase for about 4 kyr afterwards. Furthermore, the oxygen isotope record available from sediments at ODP Site 769 shows no indication of discernible climate cooling following the impact: the <b>microtektite</b> event occurred in the later part of glacial Stage 20 and {{was followed by a}} smooth warming trend to interglacial Stage 19. Thus the detailed chronology does not support the previously proposed model which would predict that a decrease in geomagnetic field intensity resulted from a minor glaciation following the impact event. We conclude that the evidence for a causal link between impacts and geomagnetic reversals remains insufficient to demonstrate a physical connection...|$|E
40|$|Although a {{terrestrial}} origin for tektites is well-established on geochemical evidence, {{the physical}} {{processes involved in}} tektite formation have been largely ignored by geochemists and petrologists. For example, two observations that potentially bear on the physics of their origin are the following: (1) The flange of an australite is often more heterogeneous than its core; and (2) <b>microtektites</b> are compositionally more diverse than tektites. The first observation contradicts the traditional view of flange formation since a second heating to super-liquidus temperatures during atmospheric re-entry should, by chemical diffusion and mixing, have tended to homogenize the melt as it flowed off {{the leading edge of}} the core to form the flange. Analyses of an australite flange have been performed by electron microprobe. The results of those analyses emphasize the magnitude of the heterogeneity, as well as the well-defined elemental correlations that may constrain the process responsible for it. The second observation that the bulk compositions of <b>microtektites</b> are more divers than the tektites within the same strewnfield is a well-known characteristic, for which no quantitative explanation has been offered.

The reported occurrence of cpx spherules from the Popigai impact structure at South Atlantic ODP Site 1090 within the middle of magnetochron C 16 n. 1 n yields a magnetochronologic age of 35. 4 Ma. We generated high-resolution stable isotope records at Sites 1090, 612 (New Jersey slope), and Caribbean core RC 9 - 58 that show: (1) a 0. 5 ‰ δ 13 C decrease in bulk-carbonate at Site 1090 coincident with the Popigai cpx spherule layer, and (2) a 0. 4 ‰- 0. 5 ‰ decrease in deep-water benthic foraminiferal δ 13 C values across the Popigai impact ejecta layer at Site 612 and core RC 9 - 58. We conclude that the δ 13 C excursion associated with Popigai was a global event throughout the marine realm that can be correlated to magnetochron C 16 n. 1 n. The amplitude of this excursion (~ 0. 5 ‰) is within the limits of natural variability, suggesting it was caused by a decrease in carbon export productivity, potentially triggered by the impact event(s). North American microtektites associated with the Chesapeake Bay impact occur stratigraphically above the Popigai cpx spherules at Site 612 and core RC 9 - 58. We found no definite evidence of a δ 13 C anomaly associated with the North American <b>microtektite</b> layer, though further studies are warranted.

40|$|Tektites are a {{group of}} natural glasses {{occurring}} in four different strewn fields on earth. They are generally small, brownish to black, partly transparent, spherically symmetric, and sometimes aerodynamically ablated. Strewn fields are geographically restricted areas on earth where tektites are found, usually in association with <b>microtektites.</b> <b>Microtektites</b> are spherules of up to about 1 mm in diameter and are retrieved from deep sea sediments. Recently <b>microtektites</b> {{have been found to}} co-occur with tektite fragments. Besides chemical, isotopical, and age arguments this gives final proof for a genetic relationship between tektites and <b>microtektites.</b> Chemically tektites are Si-rich glasses (SiO_ 2 between 65 and 85 wt%), not unlike some well known terrestrial impact glasses. The major element chemistry allows the distinction of tektites of different strewn fields, and the use of some geochemical diagrams allows the further distinction between different sub-strewn fields. Within one strewn field, we can distinguish between splash-form tektites (normal tektites) and so called Muong Nong tektites, which differ from normal tektites in respect to a higher volatile content and greater inhomogeneity, besides being of generally larger size. The trace element chemistry reveals a close similarity of tektites to terrestrial rocks, especially to surface sediments. No similarity with lunar rocks or terrestrial mantle derived rocks can be observed. Trace element ratios and rare earth element patterns are especially useful in further delineating the type of precursor rocks for tektite production. The study of isotopes, like Rb/Sr, Sm/Nd, or the lead isotopes, adds further credibility to the connection between tektites and upper crustal sediments. For two of the four strewn fields a clear connection, based on chemical, isotopical, and age considerations, between tektites and impact craters, has been established. This is the Ries crater and moldavite and the Bosumtwi crater and Ivory Coast tektite connection. The consideration of various theories of tektite origin in view of the known facts leads to the conclusion that only the production of tektites during an impact on earth is consistent with the data. Analogous studies of impact glasses associated with terrestrial impact craters (like the Zhamanshin crater) give a picture which is in accordance with the impact model for tektites. Some of these glasses show an enrichment of the platinum group and other cosmic fingerprint elements compared to the terrestrial sedimentary background, these elements being the only ones from the impacting body which may survive the impact.

40|$|The Fe {{oxidation}} state and coordination number of 29 impact glass spherules recently {{recovered from the}} Transantarctic Mountains (Antarctica) have been determined by X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. Based on geochemical, isotopic, and fission track data, these spherules are considered as microtektites from the Australasian tektite/microtektite strewn field. Their find location is the farthest so far discovered from the possible source crater region, and their alkali content is the lowest compared with other published data on Australasian <b>microtektite</b> glasses. The Fe 3 +/(Fe 2 ++Fe 3 +) ratio, determined from {{the analysis of the}} pre-edge peak energy position and integrated intensity, is below 0. 1 (± 0. 04) for all the samples, and is comparable to that of most tektites and microtektites from the Australasian strewn field. Also, the pre-edge peak integrated intensity, which is sensitive to the average Fe coordination geometry, is comparable to that of other Australasian microtektites reported in the literature. The agreement of the Fe {{oxidation state}} and coordination number, between the Transantarctic Mountain microtektites (TAM) and the Australasian tektites and microtektites, further confirms the impact origin of these glass spherules and provides an independent suggestion that they represent a major extension southeastward of the Australasian strewn field. The fact that similar redox conditions are observed in tektites and microtektites within the Australasian strewn field regardless of the distance from the source crater area (up to approximately 11000 km) could be an important constraint for better understanding the different processes affecting <b>microtektite</b> formation and transport. The fact that the Fe oxidation state of microtektites does not increase with distance, {{as in the case of}} North American microtektites, means that thermal and redox histories of Australasian and TAM microtektites could differ significantly from those of North American microtektites...|$|E
40|$|Upper Eocene microspherules (microtektites and microkrystites) {{have been}} found in deep-sea sediments from the western North Atlantic, Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, {{equatorial}} Pacific, and eastern equatorial Indian Ocean. Recent studies proposed that there are three or four microspherule layers: the North American <b>microtektite</b> and microkrystite couplet in chron C 15, and one (or two) significantly older layer(s) in chron C 16 in DSDP Sites 216, 292 and 612. Based on calcareous nannofossil biochronologic and morphometric data, I suggest that the microspherules in the latter sites correlate with the North American microtektite-microkrystite couplet. My results as well as previously published data are all compatible with the model of one couplet of microtektites-microkrystites. The inference of three or four microspherule layers in the upper Eocene is shown to be an artifact of interpretation...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{study to}} {{investigate}} the feasibility of putting nuclear wastes in glass containers and burying them on land or dumping them in the ocean, the amount of solution experience by naturally occurring glasses from two land sites and thirty-four deep sea sites was studied. The glasses are microtektites from three strewn fields and from the Zhamanshin impact crater. The microtektites {{range in age from}} 0. 7 to 35 m. y. and have a wide range in composition. The weight percent SiO 2, for example, ranges from 44. 8 to 81. 7. Although several criteria for determining the amount of solution were considered, most of the conclusions are based on two criteria: (1) width of cracks, and (2) elevation of silica rich inclusions above the adjacent <b>microtektite</b> surface. All the measurements were made on scanning electron microscope photomicrographs of the microtektites...|$|E
40|$|Major {{and trace}} element {{analyses}} of 30 sediment samples from ODP Core 758 B across the Brunhes-Matuyama geomagnetic polarity reversal and the Australasian microtektite-bearing layer show {{a small but}} significant anomaly in the elemental abundances of Ir, Co and Ni. The maximum of the anomaly between 10. 89 and 11. 00 m below seafloor correlates with the maximum abundance of <b>microtektites.</b> Iridium abundances, which show the most significant anomaly, reach 0. 16 ppb, which is evidence for an extraterrestrial component...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} model employing one-dimensional (depth) transport equations to describe vertical redistribution of ocean-floor and lake-floor sediment (particulates, volcanic ash, <b>microtektites,</b> or radioactive tracers) by episodic and nonepisodic events including bioturbation is developed analytically and demonstrated. The principles underlying the model are explained; the model equations are derived; the inverse problem of identifying the depth-dependent bioturbation coefficient is addressed; two approximation theorems are presented; and numerical results for two sample problems are presented graphically. It {{is suggested that}} compatification, porosity effects, and depth-dependent sedimentation {{be taken into account}} when formulating future models...|$|R
40|$|Impact-generated {{silicate}} spherules {{from the}} Lonar Crater, India {{and from all}} Apollo sites are analogous to meteoritic chondrules (and some <b>microtektites).</b> Thus, the impact origin of chondrules, first proposed by Urey (1952) is a mechanism strongly supported by physical evidence from both {{the moon and the}} earth. Chondrites appear to be essentially impact breccias similar to lunar and Lonar microbreccias. The implications of this with regard to size and composition of the meteorite parent bodies are reviewed as well as the possible variations of element fractionation by volatilization-condensation...|$|R
