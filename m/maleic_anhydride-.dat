40|$|This paper {{presents}} some investigations on {{the properties}} of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) based heterostructures deposited on flexible substrates. The effects of two types of maleic anhydrideâ€“aniline derivatives (maleic anhydride-cyano aniline or <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride-</b> 2, 4 dinitroaniline) buffer layer, deposited between indium tin oxide and (G) or (C) layer, on the optical and electrical properties of the heterostructures have been identified. The heterostructures containing a film of <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride-</b> 2, 4 dinitroaniline have shown a good transparency and low photoluminescence in visible range. This buffer layer has determined {{an increase in the}} conductance only in the heterostructures based on (G) and (C) deposited on biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate substrate...|$|E
40|$|Un{{modified}} {{and modified}} rice husk powder filled PVC composites were prepared having different amounts of rice husk powder. Mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of these composites were determined. The tensile strength of rice husk powder PVC composites having 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 weight percent of rice husk powder {{was found to}} be 33. 9, 19. 4, 18. 1, 14. 6, and 9. 5 MPa, respectively. Adding of <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride-</b> modified rice husk powder improved the tensile strength of rice husk powder PVC composites. Flexural strength and flexural modulus of composites increased on treatment of rice husk powder due to the improved bonding between rice husk powder and PVC matrix. Arc-resistance of rice husk powder PVC composites was not affected on increasing loading of the powder. Volume resistivity and surface resistivity decreased with increasing loading due to the presence of impurities and water molecules. Vicat softening temperature increased with rice husk powder loading. Addition of rice husk increased the melting temperature of the composite matrix as compared to pure PVC...|$|E
