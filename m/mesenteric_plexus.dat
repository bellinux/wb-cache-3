40|$|We {{examined}} {{the extent to}} which regional lymph nodes may be dissected while preserving the superior <b>mesenteric</b> nerve <b>plexus</b> (PLsma) in radical surgery for periampullary cancer. The lymph nodes were distributed uniformly on the right and left hemicircles of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and along its longitudinal axis. Of a total of 142 lymph nodes, 134 (94. 4 %) were located outside the PLsma. Dissection of the superior mesenteric lymph nodes is theoretically to be possible while preserving the superior <b>mesenteric</b> nerve <b>plexus.</b> We further investigated neural invasion and nodal involvement in the resected specimens with periampullary cancer. The following surgical approaches to lymph nodes and nerve plexus around the SMA were found best based on the results obtained. In pancreatoduodenectomy for ampullary cancer superior mesenteric lymph nodes must be dissected circumferentially, and additional dissection of right hemicircle of the PLsma is advisable. Invasive pancreatic cancer should be treated by extensive resection including complete dissection of the PLsma. This, however, leads to intractable diarrhea and digestive malabsorption. Complete dissection of the superior mesenteric nodes, right hemicirclar dissection of the PLsma and intraoperative radiation therapy are thus recommended. In mucin-producing pancreatic cancer, dissection of the PLsma is not necessary...|$|R
50|$|Diagnosis {{is usually}} made using {{clinical}} and epidemiological information. Infection with S. intercalatum {{can be distinguished}} from that of S. mansoni or S. haematobium based on where eggs manifest outside {{the body and the}} morphology of the eggs. In Africa, the only species of schistosome are S. intercalatum, S. mansoni, and S. haematobium. S. haematobium causes urinary schistosomiasis, so eggs will be shed in the urine; S. mansoni and S. intercalatum reside in the <b>mesenteric</b> venous <b>plexus,</b> so eggs will be shed in the feces. Looking at the stool specimen under a microscope, the species can be distinguished; S. intercalatum eggs have a terminal spine (as seen in the figure above) and S. mansoni eggs have a lateral spine.|$|R
40|$|Background The aim of {{this study}} was to {{ascertain}} the impact of injury to the superior <b>mesenteric</b> nerve <b>plexus</b> caused by right colectomy with D 3 extended mesenterectomy as performed in the prospective multicenter trial: ‘‘Safe Radical D 3 Right Hemicolectomy for Cancer through Preoperative Biphasic Multi-detector Computed Tomography’’ in which all soft tissue surrounding the superior mesenteric vessels from the level of the middle colic artery to that of the ileocolic artery was removed. Methods Bowel function and gastrointestinal quality of life in two consecutive cohorts that underwent right colectomy with and without D 3 extended mesenterectomy were compared. Main outcome measures were the Diarrhea Assessment Scale (DAS) and Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI). The data were collected prospectively through telephone interviews. Results Forty-nine patients per group, comparable for age, sex, length of bowel resected but with significantly shorter follow-up time in the experimental group, were included. There was no difference in total DAS scores, subscores or additional questions except for higher bowel frequency scores in the D 3 group (p = 0. 02). Comparison of total GIQLI scores and subscales showed no difference between groups. Regression analysis with correction for confounding factors showed 0. 48 lower bowel frequency scores in the D 2 group (p = 0. 022). Within the D 3 group presence of jejunal arteries cranial to the D 3 dissection area showed 1. 78 lower DAS scores and 0. 7 lower bowel frequency scores. Conclusions Small bowel denervation after right colectomy with D 3 extended mesenterectomy leads to increased bowel frequency but does not impact gastrointestinal quality of life. Individual anatomical variants can affect postoperative bowel function differently despite standardized surgery...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Glucocorticoid (GC) excess {{is related}} to hypertension. The {{deletion}} of endothelial GC-receptors abrogates the blood pressure increase, suggesting GC-induced hypertension is endothelium-dependent. In response to shear stress endothelium releases nitric oxide, endothelial derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) and prostacyclin. Recently H 2 S has been proposed {{as a candidate for}} EDHF. H 2 S is mainly produced by the enzymes cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) from L-cysteine. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the EDHF/H 2 S signaling in GC-hypertension. Methods: Male Wistar rats were treated with DEX (1. 5 mg/kg/sc) or vehicle (VEH) for 8 days. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was monitored every 2 days. EDHF was evaluated in <b>mesenteric</b> <b>plexus</b> and carotid artery performing a concentration-effect curve of acetylcholine in presence of indomethacin (INDO) and nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Apamin (APA) plus charibdotoxin (CTX), SKCa and BKCa inhibitors, or propargylglycine (PAG), CSE inhibitor, were used. CBS and CSE levels were analyzed by immunoblot. H 2 S levels were measured by a colorimetric assay. Results: DEX treatment significantly increased SBP compared to VEH (*p< 0. 05, **p< 0. 01, ***p< 0. 001 at days 2 - 4, 6, 8 respectively). EDHF-mediated relaxation of mesenteric bed or carotid artery was markedly reduced in DEX group compared to VEH (***p< 0. 001). APA and CTX as well as PAG abolished EDHF-mediated relaxation in DEX or VEH group (***,°°°p< 0. 001 respectively). CBS and CSE levels were significantly reduced in <b>mesenteric</b> <b>plexus</b> and carotid artery in DEX group (*p< 0. 05). The H 2 S production was markedly reduced in <b>mesenteric</b> <b>plexus</b> and carotid artery (*p< 0. 05, **p< 0. 01 respectively) as well as plasmatic H 2 S levels (*p< 0. 05) in DEX rats compared to VEH.

40|$|The {{autonomic}} {{nervous system}} maintains homeostasis through its sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions. During infection, cells {{of the immune system}} release cytokines and other mediators that cause fever, hypotension, and tissue injury. Although the effect of cytokines on the nervous system has been known for decades, only recently has it become evident that the {{autonomic nervous system}}, in turn, regulates cytokine production through neural pathways. We have previously shown that efferent vagus nerve signals regulate cytokine production through the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit α 7, a mechanism termed “the cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway. ” Here, we show that vagus nerve stimulation during endotoxemia specifically attenuates TNF production by spleen macrophages in the red pulp and the marginal zone. Administration of nicotine, a pharmacological agonist of α 7, attenuated TNF immunoreactivity in these specific macrophage subpopulations. Synaptophysin-positive nerve endings were observed in close apposition to red pulp macrophages, but they do not express choline acetyltransferase or vesicular acetylcholine transporter. Surgical ablation of the splenic nerve and catecholamine depletion by reserpine indicate that these nerves are catecholaminergic and are required for functional inhibition of TNF production by vagus nerve stimulation. Thus, the cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway regulates TNF production in discrete macrophage populations via two serially connected neurons: one preganglionic, originating in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, and the second postganglionic, originating in the celiac-superior <b>mesenteric</b> <b>plexus,</b> and projecting in the splenic nerve...|$|E
40|$|Intracellular {{recordings}} {{were made}} in vitro from neurones located within the left coeliac ganglion of the cat solar plexus. Thirty percent of the neurones within left coeliac ganglia were identified as efferent neurones. Within this neuronal population, splenic-efferent and renal-efferent neurones were identified specifically. Neurones within left coeliac ganglia were characterized as either phasic (fast adapting) neurones or tonic (slowly adapting) neurones depending upon their prolonged firing behaviour. Electrophysiological properties of neurones varied considerably. The wide range of values obtained for both input resistance and input capacitance suggest that sizeable differences in either specific membrane resistance or cell geometry exist within the over-all neurone population. Frequency distributions of input resistance, time constant, input capacitance and current threshold for tonic and phasic neurones {{were found to be}} significantly different. Compound excitatory post-synaptic potentials were produced by stimulation of the ipsilateral splanchnic nerves in 69 % of the neurones tested and in 3 % of the neurones tested upon stimulation of the contralateral splanchnic nerves. Electrical stimulation of nerve fibres located in the coeliac plexus, the superior <b>mesenteric</b> <b>plexus</b> or the left renal nerves generated excitatory synaptic potentials in neurones located within left coeliac ganglia. It is concluded that neurones within the left coeliac ganglion are innervated by splanchnic nerve fibres primarily contained within the left splanchnic nerves, receive excitatory synaptic input from splenic, renal and other peripheral preganglionic fibres and have extremely varied electrophysiological properties...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: Dysfunctional {{ejaculation}} and, to {{a lesser}} extent, dysfunctional erection caused by disruption of efferent sympathetic pathways is a common complication after aortoiliac reconstruction surgery. The aim was to give an anatomic motivation for a nerve-preserving approach {{on the basis of}} right-sided unilateral disruption of lumbar splanchnic nerves. Methods: Anatomic and microscopic analysis of preaortic and para-aortic retroperitoneal regions in human cadavers was performed. Anatomic analysis was conducted of two aortoiliac reconstruction operations performed on human cadavers; one was performed according to a single-blind procedure, the second with a modified procedure. Results: The lumbar splanchnic nerves supplying the superior hypogastric plexus from the right side were found to be less voluminous than the left-sided ones. The superior hypogastric plexus was found slightly shifted {{to the left of the}} midsagittal plane across the abdominal aorta and its bifurcation. Microscopic analysis revealed a thin fascia between the aorta and the subperitoneal tissue compartment. This fascia was used as a plain of dissection to mobilize the preaortic nerve-plexuses without damage from the aortic wall. Analysis of the specimens operated on showed a significant difference in nerve disruption. The standard procedure caused total disruption of the superior hypogastric plexus and extensive disruption of the inferior <b>mesenteric</b> <b>plexus.</b> The modified procedure only caused right-sided unilateral disruption of lumbar splanchnic nerves. Conclusion: The autonomic nerves supplying the bladder neck, the vas deferens, and the prostate are closely related to the abdominal aorta and its bifurcation. Right-sided unilateral disruption of lumbar splanchnic nerves without further damage to nervous structures would ensure at least one functional sympathetic pathway remaining after aortoiliac reconstruction surgery.

40|$|Background/Aims: We {{aimed to}} histopathologically examine the {{significance}} of intraoperative histological diagnosis of pancreatic head plexus stumps in patients with pancreatic cancer. Methodology: We included 94 patients (including 39 with pancreatic adenocarcinoma) who underwent dissection of pancreatic head nerve plexus (PLph) I and II in addition to pancreaticoduodenectomy between 2003 and 2011. The pancreatic nerve plexus dissection was performed en bloc with pancreaticoduodenectomy and resection of the anterior nerve tissue of the pancreas, including PLph I and II {{to the right of}} the celiac artery and superior <b>mesenteric</b> <b>plexus.</b> Intraoperative histopathological diagnoses were performed on all PLph I and II stumps. If malignancy was confirmed, partial resection of PLph II toward the left rear of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and/or the nerve plexuses surrounding SMA were additionally resected. In the absence of malignancy, R 0 resection was performed. Results: Intraoperative histopathological diagnoses of all patients were performed on a total of 1456 sites (PLph I: 542 sites, PLph II: 914 sites) with an average of 16 sites per patient. Cancer was discovered in part of the pancreatic nerve plexuses with high frequency: 15 of 94 patients (16 %); 10 of 39 patients (25. 6 %) were diagnosed as pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In the 39 cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the group with positive resection stumps that were later confirmed to be negative for cancer [PLph (+) →(-) ], i. e., those with nerve plexus stumps positive for cancer initially but were negative for cancer after additional resection, showed no statistical difference from the [PLph (-) ] group, in which all resection stumps were negative for cancer initially (p = 0. 51).

40|$|The {{delineation}} of pancreatic nerve innervations during fetal {{life may}} contribute {{to our understanding of}} pancreatic pain modalities after birth. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of nerve structures in the human pancreas throughout gestation. Computer-based image morphometry with piecewise polynomial interpolation analysis was performed to quantify nervous structures in the head, body and tail of the pancreas. Nerve structures were detected by automatic immunostaining techniques using a polyclonal antibody against two S- 100 proteins that reacts strongly with human S 100 A and B that are detected in Schwann cells. Immunoreactivity was found in the parenchyma of head, body and tail of the pancreas with the relative density being head> body> tail. In addition to this extensive set of nerve fibers terminating in the pancreas there were large bundles of en passant nerve fibers in the dorsal region of the pancreas that were 3 D reconstructed and were associated with the superior <b>mesenteric</b> <b>plexus.</b> If at first glance, the perimeter and the width of the nerve fibers seem to increase at a continuous rate up to term in all three regions of the pancreas, spatial and temporal co-analysis identified that the head of the pancreas shows a two-peak growth increase at 14 and 22 weeks of gestation with regard to the area, perimeter and width of the nerve structures, while the body and tail regions show a unique peak at 20 weeks. A developmental deceleration was found between the 22 nd and the 36 th week of gestation for the head region only. This is the first systematic study of nerve innervation of the human pancreas throughout gestation. The developmental dynamics of the pancreas nerve innervation corresponds approximately to the remodeling of the intrahepatic biliary system. Understanding the factors and disease states that may alter the distribution of nerve structures can be of significance for the development of therapies in pancreatic disorders of child- and adulthood...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIntroduction After {{surgical}} {{repair of}} gastroschisis, most neonates exhibit severe intestinal dysmotility. We hypothesized that impaired {{development of the}} enteric nervous system or interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) network contributes to impaired intestinal motility in gastroschisis. We evaluated this hypothesis in a rat model of gastroschisis. Material and Methods Gastroschisis was created surgically in rat fetuses on gestational day 18, under general anesthesia, and small bowel was harvested on day 22. Intestinal weight-to-length (IW/L) ratio, and small-bowel wall thickness were assessed. Specimens were processed for hematoxylin-eosin staining or immunohistochemistry with specific markers for neuronal cells (Hoxb 5), glial cells (GFAP, S 100), and ICCs (c-kit). Myenteric plexus maturation was assessed morphologically and compared with sham and control fetuses. Stage of development of the myenteric plexus was graded from 1 (mature) to 3 (very immature) comparatively with specimens from E 16 to E 22 control fetuses. Results Compared with sham-operated or control fetuses, gastroschisis was associated with increases in mean intestinal weight/intestinal length (IW/L) ratio, and mean thicknesses of the total, muscular, and submucosal layers of the small-bowel wall. The myenteric plexus {{were present in the}} small bowel from fetuses with gastroschisis, however all exhibited abnormal myenteric plexus maturation. Thus, of the gastroschisis fetuses, 55 % had an aspect similar to the immature myenteric plexus of E 19 -E 20 fetuses and 45 % to the very immature <b>mesenteric</b> <b>plexus</b> observed in E 16 -E 18 fetuses. When compared with sham and control groups, ICCs were less abundant in eviscerated small bowel in the gastroschisis group and often exhibited weak c-kit staining or an abnormally round shape without branches. Hoxb 5, a marker for enteric neuroblasts and neuronal precursors, was expressed similarly in myenteric plexuses in all groups. S 100 or GFAP staining showed the presence of glial cells within the myenteric plexuses in all groups. The S 100 expression level was similar in all groups. In contrast, the GFAP expression level was higher in the gastroschisis group than in the sham and control groups. Conclusion Our results suggest that delayed maturation of the enteric nervous system combined with impaired ICC network development may largely explain the intestinal dysmotility seen in neonates with gastroschisis...|$|E
40|$|Excess of glucocorticoid, either endogenous, as in Cushing syndrome, or exogenous, via {{pharmacological}} {{administration of}} glucorticoids, induces hypertension. This form of hypertension is commonly related to {{activation of the}} mineralcortocoids receptor whereas it certainly has a role (Baid S et al., 2004). However, evidences indicate that glucocorticoid elevated blood pressure independently by mineralcorticoid receptor, in both humans and animal model (Kalimi M et al., 1989; Bertagna C et al., 1986). Furthermore, glucorticoid receptor is present in both vascular smooth muscle (Provencher PH et al., 1995) and endothelium (Wallerath T et al., 1999). To date, the mechanism(s) underlying glucocorticoid induced increase in blood pressure is still unclear. The gaseous transmitters nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) together with endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) {{play a key role}} in the regulation of vascular homeostasis. In cardiovascular system, NO derived from endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) while H 2 S is predominantly produced by cisthationine-β synthase (CBS) and/or cystathionine-γ lyase (CSE). Published data suggest that H 2 S is EDHF (d'Emmanuele di Villa Bianca et al., 2011; Tang G et al., 2013). Therefore, we investigated the involvement of NO and H 2 S/EDHF signalling in glucocorticoid-induced hypertension. Male Wistar rats were treated with dexamethasone (DEX, 1. 5 mg/kg subcutaneously) or vehicle (saline) for 8 days. During treatment, blood pressure was recorded by using a tail cuff apparatus, in conscious rats. Perfused arterial <b>mesenteric</b> <b>plexus</b> was used to evaluate the NO and the EDHF contribute. Thereafter, western blot study was performed to appreciate phoshorylated-eNOS/eNOS ratio or CBS and CSE expression in mesenteric tissue. The production of NO and H 2 S was also measured. DEX treatment caused a significant increase in blood pressure. The contribute of NO mediated vasodilation was higher in the mesenteric bed of DEX-treated rats. Conversely, EDHF-mediated vasodilatation resulted significantly reduced in DEX group. In line with these findings, the peNOS/ eNOS ratio as well as NO production were significantly increased in DEX group compared with vehicle. On the other hand, CBS and CSE expression was markedly reduced in DEX group and well correlated with H 2 S production. Consistently with the fact that H 2 S is EDHF, this latter result strongly support the reduction in EDHF-vasodilation occurring in DEX-group. In conclusion, our data indicate that exists a cross-talk between NO and H 2 S in glucorticoidinduced hypertension. In this scenario H 2 S pathway could represent a novel target opening new pharmacological strategies in the control of blood pressure. Baid S and Nieman LK.
