6000|$|... "Oh, I had {{to amuse}} myself somehow," [...] she answered. [...] "I've done my hair a new way, rearranged all my ornaments, and really I don't think {{a man has}} a right to such a {{delightful}} <b>manicure</b> <b>set.</b> I felt terribly nervous in the lavatory, though. I could hear some one in the billiard-room all the time." ...|$|E
6000|$|Kipps {{listened to}} the {{architect}} with round eyes and an exuberant caution in his manner, anxious not to commit himself further than he had done to the enterprise, and the architect pointed out the Features and other objects of interest with the scalpel belonging to a pocket <b>manicure</b> <b>set</b> that he carried. Ann watched Kipps' face and communicated with him furtively over the architect's head. [...] "Not so big," [...] said Ann's lips.|$|E
60|$|If I had had {{any doubt}} but that tragedy was afoot that morning {{it would have}} been banished by a glance at her face. She was terribly pale; her hands were shaking. Rapidly she withdrew the pins from her hat, hung it upon a peg and {{smoothed}} her hair in front of the looking-glass. Then, though her hands were trembling all the time, she filled a bowl with hot water and arranged a <b>manicure</b> <b>set</b> on a little table.|$|E
25|$|The {{interest}} in sterling extended to business (sterling paper clips, mechanical pencils, letter openers, calling card boxes, cigarette cases), to the boudoir (sterling dresser trays, mirrors, hair and suit brushes, pill bottles, <b>manicure</b> <b>sets,</b> shoehorns, perfume bottles, powder bottles, hair clips) {{and even to}} children (cups, cutlery, rattles, christening sets).|$|R

60|$|Diplomatic reticence {{does not}} {{necessarily}} extend to family affairs. Peter Pigeoncote {{was never able to}} understand why Mrs. Consuelo van Bullyon, who stayed with them in the spring, always carried two very obvious jewel-cases with her to the bath-room, explaining them to any one she chanced to meet in the corridor as her <b>manicure</b> and face-massage <b>set.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cabinets were in {{the rear}} {{quarters}} beside the two rear seats; one held cocktail equipment, including cut glass decanters, glasses and thermos jugs, while the other held picnic equipment, including Perspex sandwich boxes, cups, saucers, and linen. A folding table was fitted in {{the centre of the}} front seat, a <b>manicure</b> <b>set</b> in the passenger door recess, and an ivory-handled nylon umbrella in {{the lower part of the}} passenger door. A sliding tray under the passenger side of the dashboard held a folding mirror, a clothes brush, a comb, a powder compact, a cigarette case, and a cream jar. The boot held rawhide suitcases with gilt Bramah locks.|$|E
50|$|The seating {{was similar}} to that of Green Goddess, with a three-passenger front bench and two rear {{armchairs}} with folding backs to extend luggage space when not in use. The seats were upholstered in lavender blue leather with dark blue piping. Instead of wooden veneers, the interior was finished with grey-blue lizard skins. These skins covered the steering wheels, the inside door panels, the cabinets {{on either side of the}} rear armchairs, and the <b>manicure</b> <b>set</b> fitted into the left door. The cabinets in the back contained a flask and glasses made of cut glass, a silver Thermos flask, sandwich boxes, cups, saucers, and linen, while recesses above the rear seat held an 8 mm motion picture camera and a pair of field glasses. A tray under the instrument panel held a mirror, a comb, a clothes brush, two silver-topped jars, and a powder compact. The floor was covered with Nylon carpets.|$|E
5000|$|There {{was a major}} archaeological find in October 2012 [...] {{when the}} {{foundations}} of an Anglo-Saxon feasting hall were excavated on the village green by a team from the University of Reading, led by Gabor Thomas, working with local archaeologists and villagers and funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. Guided by a ground-penetrating radar survey the hall was identified as measuring 21 metres by 8.5 metres {{and would have been}} large enough to hold at least 60 people. A decorated and gilded horse harness, broken in antiquity, was found in the foundations together with pieces of jewellery, bone combs and a well-preserved <b>manicure</b> <b>set</b> - three little bronze rods, probably for cleaning fingernails or ears, strung on to a piece of wire. The site also yielded quantities of glass, some evidently scavenged from nearby Roman sites and melted down to make glass bead jewellery. Further excavations led by the University of Reading are planned.|$|E
50|$|The exact {{origin of}} nail {{treatments}} is unclear, since {{it appears to}} have originated {{in different parts of the}} world around the same time. In ancient Egypt, from 5000 B.C. to 3000 B.C., women would dye their nails with henna to indicate social status and seductiveness. Women of the lower class wore pastel and neutral shades, while the upper classes wore deep, bright shades. In Babylonia, 3200 B.C., men, not women, painted their nails with black and green kohl, an ancient cosmetic. To prepare for war, warriors of Babylon spent hours having their nails prepared, hair curled and had other similar beauty treatments. As in ancient Egypt, nail color indicated one's status, black for noblemen and green for the common man. Around the same time, 3000 B.C., the first nail polish originated in ancient China. It was made from beeswax, egg whites, gelatin, vegetable dyes, and gum arabic. Chinese dipped their nails in this mixture for several hours or left it on to dry. Colors ranged from pink to red, depending on the mixture of the ingredients. During the Zhou Dynasty, 600 B.C., royalty used this simple nail polish with gold and silver dust on their nails to show their social status.The Ming dynasty (1368-1644) was known for extremely long nails. Sometimes these nails were protected by gold and jewel-encrusted nail guards. Servants performed personal chores for the royals so their nails did not break or become damaged. Empress Dowager Cixi of China, who ruled from 1835 to 1908, was known for her outrageous nails. There are many photos showing the empress with 6-inch-long gold guards protecting her long nails. All of the aforementioned did not use nail art as it is widely known today, only stained, dyed, or dusted the finger and toenails. First actual record of nail art was from the short-lived Inca Empire (1438-1533), which at that time was one of the largest empires in South America. Incas would decorate their nails by painting eagles on them. In 1770 the first fancy gold and silver <b>manicure</b> <b>sets</b> were created. French King Louis XVI who ruled from 1774 until his deposition in 1792, always had his nails taken care of using these sets.|$|R
