5|$|By {{the end of}} 1919, Centurion {{had been}} {{transferred}} to the Mediterranean Fleet. Although she spent <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>time</b> in reserve, she had a peripheral role in the Allied Intervention in the Russian Civil War. After her return home in 1924, the ship became the flagship of the Reserve Fleet. In 1926 Centurion was converted into a target ship and participated in trials evaluating the effectiveness of aerial bombing {{in addition to her}} normal duties. During the Second World War, the ship was rearmed with light weapons and was converted into a blockship in 1941. When that operation was cancelled, she was then modified into a decoy with dummy gun turrets in an attempt to fool the Axis powers. Centurion was sent to the Mediterranean in 1942 to escort a convoy to Malta, although the Italians quickly figured out the deception. The ship was deliberately sunk during the Invasion of Normandy in 1944 to form a breakwater.|$|E

Despite this, she remained as national champion in the event through 1939, although she left the LAAC in 1937.

5|$|On 26 January 1569, Mary {{was moved}} to Tutbury Castle {{and placed in the}} custody of the Earl of Shrewsbury and his {{formidable}} wife Bess of Hardwick. Elizabeth considered Mary's designs on the English throne to be a serious threat and so confined her to Shrewsbury's properties, including Tutbury, Sheffield Castle, Wingfield Manor and Chatsworth House, all located in the interior of England halfway between Scotland and London, and distant from the sea. Mary was permitted her own domestic staff, which never numbered less than 16, and needed 30 carts to transport her belongings from house to house. Her chambers were decorated with fine tapestries and carpets, as well as her cloth of state on which she had the French phrase En ma fin est mon commencement ("In my end lies my beginning") embroidered.

She was occasionally allowed outside under strict supervision, spent seven summers at the spa town of Buxton, and spent <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>time</b> doing embroidery.
