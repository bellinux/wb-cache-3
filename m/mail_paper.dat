5000|$|Electronic bill pay systems {{fall into}} two categories, [...] "pay-anyone" [...] {{services}} and restricted biller list services. In a pay-anyone service, the provider will facilitate a payment to the payee {{regardless of whether they}} have an electronic connection with that payee or not. If they cannot deliver the payment to the payee electronically, they will print and <b>mail</b> a <b>paper</b> check on the payer's behalf. The largest providers of electronic bill pay services can deliver about 80% of their payments electronically, so 20% of payments facilitated by the large pay-anyone services are still made by <b>mailing</b> a <b>paper</b> check to the biller. This is the primary reason why some billers in a pay-anyone service require as much as a 5-day lead time for the payment to reach the payee.|$|R

40|$|Fatigue was {{recently}} {{reported to be}} the largest predictor of poor health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in children and adolescents with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The objectives of this thesis were to describe fatigue from patients’ and parents’ perspectives and to explore associations of patient characteristics with fatigue in children and adolescents with DMD using a multicentre cross-sectional study design. Eligible patients and their parents were identified via the Canadian Neuromuscular Disease Registry and received <b>mailed</b> <b>paper</b> questionnaires. Children and adolescents with DMD experienced greater fatigue compared to healthy controls from published data. Fatigue was a significant issue in children and adolescents with DMD across all disease stages. Sleep disturbance symptoms, depressive symptoms and functional ability were associated with fatigue. Physical activity level was not associated with fatigue. These findings warrant future research aimed at understanding the determinants of fatigue and developing therapeutic strategies to reduce fatigue and improve HRQOL...|$|R
