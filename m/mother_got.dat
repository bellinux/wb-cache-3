5|$|She {{began her}} college {{studies at the}} University of La Plata. She studied {{psychology}} for a year, then dropped it and studied law instead. She met fellow student Néstor Kirchner in 1973. He introduced her to political debates. There were heated political controversies at the time caused by: {{the decline of the}} Argentine Revolution military government, the return of the former president Juan Perón from exile, the election of Héctor Cámpora as president of Argentina, and {{the early stages of the}} Dirty War. She became influenced by Peronism, left-wing politics, and anti-imperialism. Despite the presence of sympathizers of the Montoneros guerrillas in La Plata, the Kirchners had never been involved themselves. Cristina and Néstor married in a civil ceremony on 9 May 1975. Her <b>mother</b> <b>got</b> them administrative jobs at her union. The 1976 Argentine coup d'état took place the following year. Cristina proposed to go to Río Gallegos, Néstor's home city, but he delayed their departure until his graduation on 3 July 1976.|$|E
25|$|Scotland's second {{match was}} against the United States in Northampton, {{traditionally}} a rugby union city. The Tomahawks were made up of AMNRL players but Scotland {{took a while to}} get going. In the twelfth minute winger Rory Lewis unexpected put America ahead, which caused The Bravehearts to start playing well {{for the remainder of the}} first half, Scotland eventually going into the second half leading three tries to one. Graeme Thompson had kicked a penalty very early on in the game, and then after the America try added another four points. McAlister, who had missed the conversion, set up Ketteridge and Smith for Scotland's second and third tries respectively. The Bravehearts extended their lead in the second half, Shelford going over and then David Niu, who could have played for Scotland because of his Dunfermline born <b>mother,</b> <b>got</b> one back for the States. But Scotland put a victory beyond doubt with Alan Tait setting up Shelford twice for his hat-trick. Late in the game Niu and Steve Tait scored for the United States and Scotland respectively to end the match 38–16 in Scotland's favour.|$|E

500|$|Kirchherr later {{supplied}} Sutcliffe and {{the other}} Beatles with Preludin, which, when taken with beer, made them feel euphoric and helped to keep them awake until {{the early hours of}} the morning. The Beatles had taken Preludin before, but it was possible at that time to get Preludin only with a doctor's prescription note, so Kirchherr's <b>mother</b> <b>got</b> them from a local chemist, who supplied them without asking questions. After meeting Kirchherr, Lennon filled his letters to Cynthia Powell (his girlfriend at the time) with [...] "Astrid said this, Astrid did that", which made Powell jealous, until she read that Sutcliffe was in a relationship with Kirchherr. When Powell visited Hamburg with Dot Rhone (McCartney's girlfriend at the time) in April 1961, they stayed at Kirchherr's house. In August 1963, Kirchherr met Lennon and Cynthia in Paris while they were both there for a belated honeymoon, as Kirchherr was there with a girlfriend for a few days' holiday. The four of them went from wine bar to wine bar and finally ended up back at Kirchherr's lodgings, where all four fell asleep on Kirchherr's single bed.|$|E

So my <b>mother</b> <b>got</b> me a [...] Arabian that I couldn't wear out." [...] She also showed horses on the East Coast in the 1930s.

Armstrong says in a 1995 MTV interview, [...] "Basically, it wasn't like guitar lessons because I never really learned how to read music. So he just {{taught me how to}} put my hands on the thing." [...] Cole bought the guitar new from David Margen of the band Santana. Cole gave Armstrong a Bill Lawrence L500XL Humbucker pickup and told him to install the pickup in the bridge position. Armstrong switched the L500XL with a white Seymour Duncan SH-4 JB Humbucker at Woodstock '94. After the Seymour Duncan was filled with mud and ruined in November 1994, Armstrong reinstalled the original Bill Lawrence pickup before recording Insomniac in 1995, and used {{it for a long time}} after that, although he has since switched to a black Seymour Duncan SH-4 JB. [...] "Armstrong fetishized his teacher's guitar, partly because the blue instrument had a sound quality and Van Halen-worthy fluidity he couldn't get from his little red Hohner. He prized it mostly, however, because of his relationship with Cole, another father figure after the death of Andy." [...] He toured with this guitar from the band's early days and still uses it to this day, Both middle and neck pickups are disconnected and the pickup selector locked in the bridge position.
