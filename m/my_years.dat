25|$|Of those 25 years, I {{spent nine}} as {{prisoner}} of war. Those days were grim, and survival was a struggle.

Those dreams were always, unquestionably, of a life that was Army. I found that the dream of continued service gave me a goal that helped me survive <b>my</b> <b>years</b> as a POW.|$|E
25|$|After Pasternak's death, Olga Ivinskaya {{was arrested}} for the second time, with her daughter, Irina Emelyanova. Both were accused of being Pasternak's link with Western {{publishers}} and of dealing in hard currency for Doctor Zhivago. All of Pasternak's letters to Ivinskaya, {{as well as many}} other manuscripts and documents, were seized by the KGB. The KGB quietly released them, Irina after one year, in 1962, and Olga in 1964. By this time, Ivinskaya had served four years of an eight-year sentence, in retaliation for her role in Doctor Zhivagos publication. In 1978, her memoirs were smuggled abroad and published in Paris. An English translation by Max Hayward was published the same year under the title A Captive of Time: <b>My</b> <b>Years</b> with Pasternak.|$|E

500|$|Those {{writing on}} Jewish history were {{reluctant}} to glorify a slaveowner, and reacted to Benjamin's story with [...] "embarrassed dismay". This was especially so in the two generations following 1865, when {{the question of the}} Civil War remained an active issue in American politics. It was not until the 1930s that Benjamin began to be mentioned as a significant figure {{in the history of the}} United States, and in the chronicle of the Jews there. Nevertheless, Tom Mountain, in his 2009 article on Benjamin, points out that Benjamin was respected in the South as a leader of the rebel cause for a century after the Civil War, and that Southern schoolchildren who could not name the current Secretary of State in Washington knew about Benjamin. Reform Rabbi Daniel Polish noted in 1988 that Benjamin [...] "represent a significant dilemma [...] <b>my</b> <b>years</b> growing up as a Jew both proud of his people and with an intense commitment to the ideals of liberalism and human solidarity that I found embodied in the civil rights movement." ...|$|E

500|$|In mid October 2016, Waters {{announced}} that he would return to North America in 2017 with a pioneering new tour named [...] "Us + Them", stating: [...] "We {{are going to take a}} new show on the road, the content is very secret. It'll be a mixture of stuff from my long career, stuff from <b>my</b> <b>years</b> with Pink Floyd, some new things. Probably 75% of it will be old material and 25% will be new, but it will be all connected by a general theme. It will be a cool show, I promise you. It'll be spectacular like all my shows have been." [...] It is intended that the 44-date Us + Them Tour would visit the United States and Canada, showcase Waters' highlights, start on 26 May 2017 in Kansas City, MO and end on 29 October 2017 in Vancouver, BC. The tour title is derived from the track [...] "Us and Them," [...] from the 1973 Pink Floyd album The Dark Side of the Moon.|$|E
500|$|Sinatra left Capitol in 1960 {{to start}} his own record label, Reprise Records, and {{released}} a string of successful albums. In 1965, he recorded the retrospective September of <b>My</b> <b>Years,</b> starred in the Emmy-winning television special , and released the tracks [...] "Strangers in the Night" [...] and [...] "My Way". After releasing Sinatra at the Sands, recorded at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Vegas with frequent collaborator Count Basie in early 1966, the following year he recorded one of his most famous collaborations with Tom Jobim, the album Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim. It was followed by 1968's collaboration with Duke Ellington. Sinatra retired {{for the first time in}} 1971, but came out of retirement two years later and recorded several albums and resumed performing at Caesars Palace, and reached success in 1980 with [...] "New York, New York". Using his Las Vegas shows as a home base, he toured both within the United States and internationally until a short time before his death in 1998.|$|E
500|$|Sinatra's phenomenal {{success in}} 1965, coinciding with his 50th birthday, {{prompted}} Billboard to proclaim {{that he may}} have reached the [...] "peak of his eminence". In June 1965, Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr., and Dean Martin played live in St. Louis to benefit Dismas House, a prisoner rehabilitation and training center with nationwide programs that in particular helped serve African Americans. The Rat Pack concert was broadcast live via satellite to numerous movie theaters across America. The album September of <b>My</b> <b>Years</b> was released September 1965, and {{went on to win the}} Grammy Award for best album of the year. Granata considers the album to have been one of the finest of his Reprise years, [...] "a reflective throwback to the concept records of the 1950s, and more than any of those collections, distills everything that Frank Sinatra had ever learned or experienced as a vocalist". One of the album's singles, [...] "It Was a Very Good Year", won the Grammy Award for Best Vocal Performance, Male. A career anthology, A Man and His Music, followed in November, winning Album of the Year at the Grammys the following year.|$|E

500|$|On November10,2010, [...] "Don't You Wanna Stay" [...] was {{performed}} {{live for the}} first time by Aldean with Clarkson on the 44th Country Music Association Awards. The performance triggered an overwhelming demand from radio stations across the country. As a result, Aldean’s label, Broken Bow Records, made the song available on PLAY MPE. Carson James, the label's Senior Vice President for Promotion responded, [...] "If there’s one thing I’ve learned in <b>my</b> <b>years</b> in the record business, it is always give radio what they want [...] Our entire promotion staff has spent all night fielding calls and returning texts about getting this song, so we decided it best to release it on Play MPE first thing this morning." [...] Myra Dehais of RED Company claimed that the song's rise at adult-radio stations was a result of the company's distribution, saying [...] "This is a proud moment for RED distribution, [...] In crossing a country song over to the adult and pop formats, we can face resistance, since (some) stations have only a slot or two for country music, in order to maintain sonic balance. [...] "Don't You Wanna Stay" [...] was later included on the deluxe edition of Clarkson's fifth studio album, Stronger (2011).|$|E
500|$|The album Margerine Eclipse {{followed}} in 2004 with generally positive reviews, and peaked at number 174 on the US Billboard 200. The track [...] "Feel and Triple" [...] {{was written in}} tribute to Hansen; [...] according to Sadier [...] "I was reflecting on <b>my</b> <b>years</b> with her... reflecting on how we sometimes {{found it hard to}} express the love we had for one another." [...] Sadier continued, [...] "Our dedication to her on the album [...] says, 'We will love you till the end', meaning of our lives. I'm not religious, but I feel Mary's energy is still around somewhere. It didn't just disappear." [...] The Observers Molloy Woodcraft awarded the album four out of five stars, and described Sadier's vocal performance as [...] "life- and love-affirming", and the record as a whole as [...] "Complex and catchy, bold and beatific." [...] Kelefa Sanneh argued in Rolling Stone that Margerine Eclipse was [...] "full of familiar noises and aimless melodies". Margerine Eclipse was Stereolab's last record to be released on American label Elektra Records, which shut down that same year. Future material would be released on Too Pure, the same label which had released some of the band's earliest material.|$|E
500|$|After a {{break of}} almost four months, Beholder {{returned}} in the Torrey Pines Stakes over one mile at Del Mar on September 1, {{where she was}} ridden {{for the first time}} by Gary Stevens. She started the 1–10 favorite and led all the way, winning from second-place finisher Wittgenstein. Four weeks later, Beholder was matched against older fillies and mares in the Grade I Zenyatta Stakes over eight and a half furlongs at Santa Anita. She led from the start and won, with the six-year-old veteran Authenticity in second. Mandella called the winner [...] "a filly that really likes the fight" [...] while Stevens said that [...] "I haven't gotten close to the bottom of her yet". On November 1, Beholder contested the Breeders' Cup Distaff over nine furlongs at Santa Anita. The field was a very strong one, including Royal Delta who had won the race for the last two years, Princess of Sylmar, Authenticity, and Close Hatches. Although Beholder showed some anxiety in the starting gate, she had a clean start. Mandella had been training her so that instead of always being a front-runner, she could be [...] rated behind other horses and conserve energy. His strategy was a success as Beholder tracked the leaders before moving up into second place half a mile from the finish. She took the lead two furlongs out and went clear of the field to win by [...] lengths over Close Hatches, with Royal Delta fourth and Princess of Sylmar last of the six runners. After the race, Mandella said, [...] "I’ve been lucky enough to have many good mares in <b>my</b> <b>years</b> of training, but this mare might have to be the best of all." [...] With her Distaff win, she became the first horse to win both the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies and the Distaff in consecutive years.|$|E
