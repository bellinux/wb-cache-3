2500|$|Due to his {{holding of}} a moiety of the barony of Newmarch, Russell became liable to provide one knight {{to the royal}} army for a fixed number of days per annum. Even before this grant it appears Russell held other lands by <b>military</b> <b>tenure</b> as in a Chancery {{document}} he is recorded as proffering knight service in 1213-14, but {{the size of his}} contingent is not legible. He received such a summons in 1218, as one of seven others in Somerset and Devon, one of 115 England-wide, to attend the royal army at Stamford on St John the Baptist's Day (15 July) in the third week of Henry III (1218). The army was to be used for the siege of Newark Castle, which was held against the king by Robert de Gaugy, a Flemish lieutenant of Philip Marc. The scutage roll states: Johannes Russel mittat unum militem pro terra qui fuit Jacobi de Novomercato (John Russell sent one knight in respect of the land which was of James de Newmarch (Latinised to [...] "New-Market")). Below this entry is the record of a summons to John de Bottrel, who held the other moiety of the barony of North Cadbury: Johannes de Botereauls veniat pro eadem terra (John de Bottrel came in respect of the same land).|$|E
6000|$|Feudal tenures were {{originally}} {{divided into two}} great classes; those which were called the <b>military</b> <b>tenures,</b> or knight's service, and soccage. The first tenure was that which became oppressive in the progress of society. Soccage was of two kinds; free and villain. The first has an affinity to our own system, as connected with these leases; the last never existed among us at all. When the knight's service, or <b>military</b> <b>tenures</b> of England, were converted into free soccage, in the reign of Charles II., the concession was considered of a character so favorable to liberty as to be classed among the great measures of the time; {{one of which was}} the habeas corpus act! ...|$|R

The non-military freehold tenures are next dealt with: we have an account of [...] "socage tenure", into which all <b>military</b> <b>tenures</b> were subsequently commuted by a now unrecognised act of the Long Parliament in 1650, afterwards reënacted by the well known statute of Charles II (1660), and of [...] "frankalmoign", or the spiritual tenure by which churchmen held.|$|R
2500|$|In August 1863, {{just three}} weeks after the {{invasion}} of the Waikato began, Attorney-General Frederick Whitaker and Defence Minister Thomas Russell sent Governor Grey a memorandum signed by Premier Alfred Domett, claiming that the Waikato, the most powerful Māori tribe, was planning to drive out or destroy Europeans and establish a native kingdom. They argued that the security of the colony demanded that Māori aggression needed to be punished and proposed that an armed population be recruited from the goldfields of Otago and Australia and settled on land taken from the [...] "enemy". Whitaker and Russell, leading Auckland financiers, speculators and lawyers, were the most powerful men in the ministry and stood to make a substantial fortune if Māori south of Auckland could be moved from their land. Grey, who had recently returned from a term as Governor of the Cape Colony in South Africa, where the military settlement of Xhosa land had been undertaken, embraced the idea and in a dispatch to the Colonial Office a month later set out details of the plan, repeating the claim that Māori planned the wholesale destruction of some European settlements. The proposal was to place 5000 military settlers on the Waikato and Taranaki frontiers, each holding a 20 hectare farm on <b>military</b> <b>tenure.</b>|$|E
60|$|Whilst this {{garrison}} afforded security {{against any}} sudden {{attempt on the}} part of the Welsh to surprise the castle, a strong body of forces were disposed within a few miles of the Garde Doloureuse, ready, on the least alarm, to advance to defend the place against any more numerous body of invaders, who, undeterred by the fate of Gwenwyn, might have the hardihood to form a regular siege. To this band, which, under the eye of Damian de Lacy himself, was kept in constant readiness for action, could be added on occasion all the military force of the Marches, comprising numerous bodies of Flemings, and other foreigners, who held their establishments by <b>military</b> <b>tenure.</b>|$|E
60|$|It was in vain {{that the}} archery {{belonging}} to Raymond's little band, stout yeomen, who, {{for the most}} part, held possession by <b>military</b> <b>tenure,</b> exhausted their quivers on the broad mark afforded them by the Welsh army. It is probable, that every shaft carried a Welshman's life on its point; yet, to have afforded important relief to the cavalry, now closely and inextricably engaged, the slaughter {{ought to have been}} twenty-fold at least. Meantime, the Welsh, galled by this incessant discharge, answered it by volleys from their own archers, whose numbers made some amends for their inferiority, and who were supported by numerous bodies of darters and slingers. So that the Norman archers, who had more than once attempted to descend from their position to operate a diversion in favour of Raymond and his devoted band, were now so closely engaged in front, as obliged them to abandon all thoughts of such a movement.|$|E

40|$|The {{first in}} this series of {{articles}} left Scotland {{on the verge of}} agrarian transformation. Although the nation geographically nearest to England, it remained in 1745 considerably more distant in social structure. England was the first state unambiguously to complete the transition from feudal to capitalist agriculture. Unlike England, however, those that followed did not have a period of several centuries in which to undertake the process. Lenin identified the alternatives that they faced as the Prussian ‘reformist’ and American ‘revolutionary’ paths. Scotland was to prefigure the Prussian path, where the feudal landowners themselves instigated the transition to capitalism in the countryside. After the final defeat of Jacobitism at Culloden in 1746, the Scottish feudal landowners were juridically stripped of the powers (<b>military</b> <b>tenures,</b> local jurisdictions) with which a section of them had threatened the British state. They were, however, allowed to retain most of their power over their tenants. With no remaining alternative but to adapt to the capitalist mode of production, they systematically used these powers to reorganize their estates along existing English lines. The speed and extent of the transformation that followed remains unprecedented in Western European history...|$|R

60|$|The {{security}} {{he began}} to enjoy from this success, and the strength which government receives by merely continuing, gave room to his natural dispositions to break out in several acts of tyranny and injustice. The forest laws were executed with rigor, the old impositions revived, and new laid on. Lanfranc made representations to the king on this conduct, but they produced no other effect than the abatement of his credit, which from that moment to his death, which happened soon after, was {{very little in the}} government. The revenue of the vacant see was seized into the king's hands. When the Church lands were made subject to military service, they seemed to partake all the qualities of the <b>military</b> <b>tenure,</b> and to be subject to the same burdens; and as on the death of a military vassal his land was in wardship of the lord until the heir had attained his age, so there arose a pretence, on the vacancy of a bishopric, to suppose the land in ward with the king until the seat should be filled. This principle, once established, opened a large field for various lucrative abuses; nor could it be supposed, whilst the vacancy turned to such good account, that a necessitous or avaricious king would show any extraordinary haste to put the bishoprics and abbacies out of his power. In effect, William always kept them a long time vacant, and in the vacancy granted away much of their possessions, particularly several manors belonging to the see of Canterbury; and when he filled this see, it was only to prostitute that dignity by disposing of it to the highest bidder.|$|E

40|$|The {{recorded}} {{history of the}} lordship under the House of Fergus lasted from only e. 1130 to 1231, but its origins lie in the fusion of the various peoples settled there by c. 1000. A blend of Celtic and Germanic groups created a hybrid culture that had {{more in common with}} Man and the Isles than mainland Scotland. Galwegian attitudes to and relationship with Scotland before c. 1130 are unclear, but ties with York and Man had greater value than Scottish claims to overlordship. The emergence of a powerful line of rulers kept the ambitions of the Crown in check, but any divisions in their ranks were exploited by the Scots. Close family links with the Plantagenet kings provided a counterbalance to Scottish interference, but brought English overlordship instead. This had the side-effect of securing the separation of the see of Whithorn from the Scottish Church. Marriage and kinship ties brought the lords political power in Scotland, England and Man, and control of estates outwith the lordship. This in turn led to the closer integration of Galloway into Scotland as its rulers gained high office in the kingdom. Thus the lords developed a dual character as Anglo-Scottish baron and Celtic chieftain. Introduction of Normanised colonists and the development of 'feudal' <b>military</b> <b>tenures</b> fostered this transition and eroded regional particularism. Integration was accelerated by elimination of the male line and partition between heiresses married into Anglo-Norman families. Division broke the power of Galloway, weakened the influence of its new rulers over the Galwegians and gave the Crown the control for which it had long striven...|$|R

50|$|The {{principle}} of commuting for money {{the obligation of}} military service struck {{at the root of}} the whole system, and so complete was the change of conception that tenure by knightservice of a mesne lord becomes, first in fact and then in law, tenure by escuage (i.e. scutage).

In 1285 however Robert le Deneys was holding these manors not from the de Pomeroy barons but from the heirs of Patrick de Chaworth, who was successor in title to Brewer, lord of the manor of Buckland Brewer amongst others, who had himself purchased them from de Pomeroy.|$|R
50|$|The {{regicide}} {{was followed}} by the revolt of Abaza Mehmed Pasha, then governor of Erzurum, who vowed to take revenge upon the sultan's killers and massacred the janissaries wherever he found them. Mustafa I, who had been enthroned for the second time, was soon deposed yet again and replaced by Ahmed I's son Murad IV, still a child. Thus with a child on the throne, Istanbul under the control of a Janissary clique, and Abaza Mehmed running rampant in the east, the Safavids saw another opportunity to attack and seized control of Baghdad in January 1624, but were unable to advance to Diyarbakır. In 1628 Abaza Mehmed's revolt was suppressed by the grand vizier Husrev Pasha, whose dismissal from office in 1632 triggered a Janissary revolt. This event fueled Murad IV's desire to regain control over the state, and he henceforth began to exercise power in his own right. He carried out a reform of <b>military</b> land <b>tenure</b> in an effort to strengthen the army, encouraged peasant resettlement of abandoned fields, and enforced moral reform in Istanbul in conjunction with the religious movement of the Kadızadelis. First achieving military success in 1635 with the conquest of Yerevan, he was ultimately able to lead the empire to victory by reconquering Baghdad in 1638 and establishing a long-lasting peace with the Safavids the following year.|$|R

During the same period (1973-87), population increased at an average annual rate of 2.6 percent (2.4 percent for 1980-87). The poor performance of agriculture was related to several factors, including drought; a government policy of controlling prices and the free movement of agricultural products from surplus to deficit areas; the unstable political climate; the dislocation of the rural community caused by resettlement, villagization, and conscription of young farmers to meet <b>military</b> obligations; land <b>tenure</b> difficulties {{and the problem of}} land fragmentation; the lack of resources such as farm equipment, better seeds, and fertilizers; and the overall low level of technology.|$|R
50|$|The {{popularity}} of Papagos, who had reinstated {{the autonomy of}} the Greek <b>military</b> during his <b>tenure</b> as its commander, enabled the party to quickly eclipse the Populists. In the September 1951 general election, the Greek Rally garnered 114 parliamentary seats (taking 36.5 per cent of the vote) compared to only two for the People's Party - thus firmly establishing itself as the major force of the right. This was well short of a majority, and Papagos refused to enter a coalition. In the subsequent November 1952 general election, the Greek Rally gained 240 out of 300 seats in the Greek Parliament, an achievement helped in no small way by a change in the electoral system. The party effectively ended with the death of its leader in October 1955. His successor, Karamanlis, relaunched the party as the National Radical Union.|$|R
