5|$|In 1869, the Newton {{brothers}} {{suggested that}} the carpal knobs may have been formed through continuous injuries, as they resemble diseased bone. It has also been claimed that the carpal knobs were instead formed due to a hereditary disease caused by inbreeding. This was dismissed in a 2013 study, since such lesions would likely not occur only in a specific part of the skeleton, but would appear in any growing bone tissue. If such a disease was due to inbreeding, {{it would also be}} present in other isolated island bird populations, but it is not. The authors instead {{suggested that the}} wing bones contained <b>metaplastic</b> tissue able to form the knob. This development was either in response to continuous impacts during combat, or to hormones released when individuals paired up and acquired territories. It appears a male which had long held a territory would possess especially large carpal knobs, and that their mates would have such developments as well, only smaller.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, an {{histological}} {{study concluded}} that these osteoderms, skin ossifications, of Hesperosaurus are essentially identical in structure to those of Stegosaurus. CAT-scans showed that the plates have thin but dense outer walls, filled with thick spongy bone. The bone shows signs of having been remodelled during a <b>metaplastic</b> growth process. Extensive long and wide arterial canals were visible. The spikes have thicker walls and the hollows in the spongy interior are smaller. A single large blood vessel ran along the longitudinal axis of the spike.|$|E
500|$|John Scannella, {{in a paper}} {{presented}} in Bristol, UK at the conference of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology (25 September 2009) reclassified Torosaurus as especially mature Triceratops individuals, perhaps representing a single sex. Jack Horner, Scannella's mentor at Bozeman Campus, Montana State University, noted that ceratopsian skulls consist of <b>metaplastic</b> bone. A characteristic of <b>metaplastic</b> bone is that it lengthens and shortens over time, extending and resorbing to form new shapes. Significant variety is seen even in those skulls already identified as Triceratops, Horner said, [...] "where the horn orientation is backwards in juveniles and forward in adults". Approximately 50% of all subadult Triceratops skulls have two thin areas in the frill that correspond with the placement of [...] "holes" [...] in Torosaurus skulls, suggesting that holes developed to offset the weight that {{would otherwise have been}} added as maturing Triceratops individuals grew longer frills. A paper describing these findings in detail was published in July 2010 by Scannella and Horner. It formally argues that Torosaurus and the similar contemporary Nedoceratops are synonymous with Triceratops.|$|E
500|$|Nabothian cysts (or Nabothian follicles) {{form in the}} {{transformation}} zone where the lining of <b>metaplastic</b> epithelium has replaced mucous epithelium and caused a strangulation of the outlet {{of some of the}} mucous glands. A build up of mucus in the glands forms Nabothian cysts, usually less than about [...] in diameter, which are considered physiological rather than pathological. Both gland openings and Nabothian cysts are helpful to identify {{the transformation}} zone.|$|E
500|$|In prepubertal girls, the {{functional}} squamocolumnar junction is present just within the cervical canal. Upon entering puberty, due to hormonal influence, and during pregnancy, the columnar epithelium extends outwards over the ectocervix as the cervix everts. Hence, this also causes the squamocolumnar junction to move outwards onto the vaginal {{portion of the}} cervix, where it is exposed to the acidic vaginal environment. [...] The exposed columnar epithelium can undergo physiological metaplasia and change to tougher <b>metaplastic</b> squamous epithelium in days or weeks, which {{is very similar to}} the original squamous epithelium when mature. The new squamocolumnar junction is therefore internal to the original squamocolumnar junction, and the zone of unstable epithelium between the two junctions is called the transformation zone of the cervix. After menopause, the uterine structures involute and {{the functional}} squamocolumnar junction moves into the cervical canal.|$|E

2500|$|Adenocarcinomas of the {{esophagus}} tend to arise {{in a field}} defect called Barrett's esophagus, a red patch of tissue in the generally pink lower esophagus. [...] A diagnosis of Barrett’s esophagus is confirmed by a <b>metaplastic</b> change of the esophageal mucosa from squamous to columnar mucosa with intestinal metaplasia. [...] Barrett's esophagus is the dominant pre-malignant lesion of esophageal adenocarcinoma, and has prevalent epigenetic alterations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{presence}} of goblet cells, called intestinal metaplasia, {{is necessary to}} make a diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus. [...] This frequently occurs in the {{presence of}} other <b>metaplastic</b> columnar cells, but only the presence of goblet cells is diagnostic. [...] The metaplasia is grossly visible through a gastroscope, but biopsy specimens must be examined under a microscope to determine whether cells are gastric or colonic in nature. Colonic metaplasia is usually identified by finding goblet cells in the epithelium and is necessary for the true diagnosis.|$|E
2500|$|Many histologic mimics of Barrett's {{esophagus}} {{are known}} (i.e. goblet cells {{occurring in the}} transitional epithelium of normal esophageal submucosal gland ducts, [...] "pseudogoblet cells" [...] in which abundant foveolar [...] type mucin simulates the acid mucin true goblet cells). [...] Assessment of relationship to submucosal glands and transitional-type epithelium with examination of multiple levels through the tissue may allow the pathologist to reliably distinguish between goblet cells of submucosal gland ducts and true Barrett's esophagus (specialized columnar metaplasia). [...] Use of the histochemical stain Alcian blue pH 2.5 is also frequently used to distinguish true intestinal-type mucins from their histologic mimics. [...] Recently, immunohistochemical analysis with antibodies to CDX-2 (specific for mid and hindgut intestinal derivation) has also been used to identify true intestinal-type <b>metaplastic</b> cells. The protein AGR2 is elevated in Barrett's esophagus {{and can be used}} as a biomarker for distinguishing Barrett epithelium from normal esophageal epithelium.|$|E
50|$|Signaling {{mechanisms}} {{implicated in}} these <b>metaplastic</b> effects include autophosphorylation of αCaMKII, changes in NMDA receptor subunit composition, and activation of voltage-dependent calcium channels.

50|$|<b>Metaplastic</b> {{carcinoma}} is {{cancer that}} begins in cells that have changed into another cell type (for example, a squamous cell of the esophagus changing {{to resemble a}} cell of the stomach).

50|$|Cystitis glandularis {{is a term}} {{describing}} a metaplasial transformation of mucosal cells lining the urinary bladder. The main importance is in histopathology, distinguishing the <b>metaplastic</b> change from urothelial cell carcinoma. It is a very common finding in bladder biopsies and cystectomies, and most often found in the trigone area. Cystitis glandularis lesions are usually present as small microscopic foci; however, occasionally it can form raised intramucosal or polypoid lesions.

50|$|Autoimmune <b>metaplastic</b> atrophic {{gastritis}} (AMAG) is an inherited form of {{atrophic gastritis}} {{characterized by an}} immune response directed toward parietal cells and intrinsic factor.

50|$|The medical {{significance}} of metaplasia {{is that in}} some sites where pathological irritation is present, cells may progress from metaplasia, to develop dysplasia, and then malignant neoplasia (cancer). Thus, at sites where abnormal metaplasia is detected, efforts are made to remove the causative irritant, thereby decreasing the risk of progression to malignancy. The <b>metaplastic</b> area must be carefully monitored to ensure that dysplastic change does not begin to occur. A progression to significant dysplasia indicates that the area could need removal to prevent the development of cancer.|$|E
50|$|Research in 2004 {{has shown}} that endocannabinoid release from the postsynaptic neuron can inhibit {{activation}} of the presynaptic neuron. Type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1Rs) are the receptors on the presynaptic neuron responsible for this effect. The specific ligand {{is thought to be}} 2-arachidonyl glycerol, or 2-AG. This has mainly been found in GABAergic synapses and thus has been termed inhibitory long term depression (I-LTD). This effect {{has been found to be}} extremely localized and accurate, meaning the cannabinoids do not diffuse far from their intended target. This inhibition of inhibitory neurotransmission primes proximal excitatory synapses for future LTP induction and is thus <b>metaplastic</b> in nature.|$|E
