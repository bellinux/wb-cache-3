[...] In 2004, ESPN.com ranked his cutter as the best [...] "out pitch" [...] in baseball. Olney described his cut fastball as [...] "the most dominant pitch of a generation". Although switch-hitters usually bat left-handed against right-handed pitchers to better see the ball's release point, switch-hitters occasionally batted right-handed when facing the right-handed Rivera to avoid being jammed on their hands by his cutter. Similarly, some managers, such as Bruce Bochy in the 1998 World Series, sent right-handed batters to pinch hit for left-handers [...] against Rivera, thinking that the cutter would be more difficult for lefties to hit. Opposing hitters occasionally chose to face Rivera with backup or batting practice bats, rather than risk their best bats being broken by his cutter.|$|E

Paul Kolnik in USA Today enjoyed the contradiction that Green Day's [...] "massively popular, starkly disenchanted album ... would be the feel-good musical of the season". Time magazine's Richard Zoglin opined that the score [...] "is as pure a specimen of contemporary punk rock as Broadway has yet encountered [...] there's enough variety.... Where the show fall short is as a fully developed narrative." [...] He concluded that [...] "American Idiot, despite its earnest huffing and puffing, remains little more than an annotated rock concert.... Still, [...] deserves at least two cheers– for its irresistible musical energy and for opening fresh vistas for that odd couple, rock and Broadway." [...] Peter Travers from Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "Though American Idiot carries echoes of such rock musicals as Tommy, Hair, Rent and Spring Awakening, it cuts its own path to the heart. You won’t know what hit you. American Idiot knows no limits— it's a global knockout." ...|$|E

2500|$|When the Tevetoğlu family {{relocated}} to Turkey, Tarkan {{began to study}} music {{in high school in}} Karamürsel, before being accepted at the Üsküdar Musiki Cemiyeti Academy in Istanbul. After his family moved to Istanbul in 1988, he began to prepare for University entrance exams in 1990, but had a difficult time in Istanbul with little money. He worked at low-paying jobs, including a stint as a wedding singer. Music legend has it that just as he was preparing to return to Germany, he met Mehmet Söğütoğlu, chairman of the record company İstanbul Plak. Produced by Söğütoğlu, his debut album Yine Sensiz (Without You Again) sold 750 thousand copies after its release in December 1992. For the album he had teamed up with then little known songwriter-composer Ozan Çolakoğlu, who later co-produced his albums.

[...] "Also, because he had so much power and unquestioned authority, I {{thought it would be}} an interesting contrast to play him as a gentle man, unlike Al Capone, who beat up people with baseball bats." [...] Duvall later marveled to A's Biography, [...] "He minimized the sense of beginning. In other words he, like, deemphasized the word action. He would go in front of that camera just like he was before. Cut! It was all the same. There was really no beginning. I learned a lot from watching that." [...] Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, but he declined it, becoming the second actor to refuse a Best Actor award (after George C. Scott for Patton). He boycotted the award ceremony, instead sending American Indian rights activist Sacheen Littlefeather, who appeared in full Apache attire, to state Brando's reasons, which were based on his objection to the depiction of American Indians by Hollywood and television.|$|E

2500|$|In Canada, Coronation Street is {{broadcast}} on CBC Television. Until 2011, episodes were shown in Canada approximately 10 months after they aired in Britain; however, {{beginning in the}} fall of 2011, the CBC began showing two episodes every weekday, in order {{to catch up with the}} ITV showings, at 6:30pm and 7pm local time Monday-Friday, with an omnibus on Sundays at 7.30am. By May 2014, the CBC was only two weeks behind Britain, so the show was reduced to a single showing weeknights at 6:30pm local time. The show debuted on Toronto's CBLT in July 1966. The 2002 edition of the Guinness Book of Records recognises the 1,144 episodes sold to the now-defunct CBC-owned Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, TV station CBKST by Granada TV on 31 May 1971 to be the largest number of TV shows ever purchased in one transaction. The show traditionally aired on weekday afternoons in Canada, with a Sunday morning omnibus. [...] In 2004, CBC moved the weekday airings from their daytime slot to prime time. In light of austerity measures imposed on the CBC in 2012, which includes further cutbacks on non-Canadian programming, one of the foreign shows to remain on the CBC schedule is Coronation Street, according to the CBC's director of content planning Christine Wilson, who commented: [...] "Unofficially I can tell you Coronation Street is coming back. If it didn't come back, something would happen on Parliament Hill." [...] Kirstine Stewart, the head of the CBC's English-language division, once remarked: [...] "Coronation Street fans are the most loyal, except <b>maybe</b> <b>for</b> curling viewers, of all CBC viewers," [...] In late September 2014, CBC aired extra episodes to become only one week behind the UK in airing of new episodes.|$|E
2500|$|Efeturi Doghudje of 360Nobs commended the {{character}} development, praised {{the performance of}} Demola Adedoyin, and the costume design. She rated the film 9 out of 10, and concluded: [...] "Script writer Tunde Babalola, was incredible, as October 1, {{was much more than}} just an entertaining feature, it was deep, intense and had that suspense that got us in the hall talking. Asides attention to detail, Babalola paid as much attention to the script trying to relive the experience of the 1960s and tying it perfectly to the British way of governing us, our tribal issues and our eventual independence. It [...] was pieced together wonderfully and creatively executed. October 1 is a must see for all". Wilfred Okiche of YNaija praised its production design, and concluded: [...] "In many ways, October 1 is a typical Kunle Afolayan film, what with the ensemble cast, big budget, period setting, ambitious story and dark psychological suspense. But where he does not leave an indelible mark on the film, one that will in future days be identified as the Afolayan touch. He proves once again and <b>maybe</b> <b>for</b> the first time in film this year, that ambition is good and no one can represent Nigeria better than Nigerians. Nollywood is rising indeed, and October 1 is a shining example". Amarachukwu Iwuala of Pulse NG praised the subtle themes in the film, while noting Kayode Olaiya as the highlight performance, and concluded that although [...] "October 1 is not fast-paced, the action nonetheless unravels at a rate that keeps everyone in suspense. The film aptly integrates several interesting subplots; smartly employing subtext and irony. This 140-minute picture is another feat for Nollywood". Augustine Ogwo of News Wire comments: [...] "October 1 is brilliant, thought-provoking and timeless. October 1 preaches the truth and it does so from an artistic point of view. Kudos must be given to Tunde Babalola for writing such an amazing script and also to the producer/director of this movie for breathing life into the story. October 1 is such a good movie that it has the power to plunge every well meaning Nigerian into a reflective mood and possibly positive action".|$|E
