5|$|A <b>major</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the {{development}} process of Perl 5 occurred with Perl 5.11; {{the development}} community has switched to a monthly release cycle of development releases, with a yearly schedule of stable releases. By that plan, bugfix point releases will follow the stable releases every three months.|$|E
5|$|A <b>major</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the {{training}} programme occurred in 1943. From {{that point on}} training concentrated more on the assault infantry role and less on raiding operations. Training now included how to call for fire support from artillery and naval gunfire, and how to obtain tactical air support from the Allied air forces. More emphasis was put on joint training, with two or more Commando units working together in brigades.|$|E
5|$|Prokaryotes {{inhabited}} the Earth from approximately 3–4 billion years ago. No obvious changes in morphology or cellular organisation occurred in these organisms {{over the next}} few billion years. The eukaryotic cells emerged between 1.6–2.7 billion years ago. The next <b>major</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> cell structure came when bacteria were engulfed by eukaryotic cells, in a cooperative association called endosymbiosis. The engulfed bacteria and the host cell then underwent coevolution, with the bacteria evolving into either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes. Another engulfment of cyanobacterial-like organisms {{led to the formation of}} chloroplasts in algae and plants.|$|E

5|$|Pupae {{have the}} ability to enter facultative diapause, the state of arrested {{development}} and growth in response to a change in the environment. By preparing themselves for a <b>major</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> environmental conditions, they can increase reproductive success. Diapause increases with increasing latitude. In tropical conditions, populations breed continuously, and only 2-4% of pupae diapause. In subtropical and temperate regions, most individuals diapause. Individuals who don't enter diapause in these areas emerge in late fall and die without reproducing. Drought-responsive diapause has also been observed in the summer.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat of}} the U-boats in the mid-Atlantic and their withdrawal, meant the Bay of Biscay became {{congested}} with German submarines seeking refuge. Thus, AOC Slessor revisited the interdiction strategy which had been tried, and failed in 1941 and 1943. This time, there were crucial differences. Firstly, the improvement of radar had enhanced detection of submarines, submerged and surfaced, and intelligence breakthroughs, in which the British Ultra organisation had broken the naval Enigma codes and confirmed a <b>major</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> German strategy, enabled the British {{to focus on the}} Biscay.|$|E
5|$|The <b>major</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> {{agriculture}} in Kerala {{occurred in the}} 1970s when production of rice fell due to increased availability of rice all over India and decreased availability of labour. Consequently, investment in rice production decreased and {{a major portion of}} the land shifted to the cultivation of perennial tree crops and seasonal crops. Profitability of crops fell due to a shortage of farm labour, the high price of land, and the uneconomic size of operational holdings.|$|E

Aside from the four minutes originally deleted from Lucas' original cut retained, the only <b>major</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the DVD version is the main title sequence, particularly the sky background to Mel's Drive-In, which was redone by ILM. Universal {{released the}} film on Blu-ray on May 31, 2011.|$|E

5|$|A <b>major</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the Army's {{organization}} in the Pacific occurred on 15 May 1972, {{in conjunction with the}} return of Okinawa to Japanese control after twenty-seven years of administration by the United States. Under the complex reorganization that accompanied reversion, Headquarters, IX U.S. Army Corps, was transferred from Okinawa and collocated with Headquarters, U.S. Army Japan, to form Headquarters, U.S. Army, Japan/IX Corps, at Camp Zama, Japan. There, its responsibilities included administrative oversight of US forces as well as conducting training and exercises with US and other units in the region. On Okinawa, Headquarters, U.S. Army, Ryukyu Islands, and Headquarters, 2d Logistical Command, were inactivated.|$|E
5|$|At the 2002 World Equestrian Games, riding Krack C, she {{finished}} 11th individually and rode to 5th {{place with the}} Dutch team. Her best finish was at the 2006 Games, riding Salinero, where she won an individual gold and two silvers, one individually and one team. At the 2010 Games, after her top horse Salinero was injured and second-best horse Painted Black was sold, she competed {{as part of the}} Dutch reining team, marking a <b>major</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> discipline. Riding Whizashiningwalla BB, she was eliminated in the qualifying rounds. At the Games, she also performed a reining demonstration at the presentation of the team dressage medal and participated in an exhibition of freestyle reining. Van Grunsven began riding reining horses around 2000, but only became a serious competitor in the sport after the 2008 Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Beyond minor improvements, MD410 in Montgomery County has {{remained}} {{in much the}} same state since 1950. The only major change was the highway being split onto a one-way pair of streets in Bethesda in 1988. The Prince George's County section has seen more substantial changes over the intervening decades. The first <b>major</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> alignment occurred in 1956, when MD410 was completed on a new alignment as a four-lane divided highway between Ager Road just east of MD212 and MD500 at what is now Adelphi Road. The state highway was subsequently extended east over what was previously MD403, known as Colesville Road, to US1 in Riverdale.|$|E

5|$|The <b>major</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> {{international}} trade was the {{rapid expansion of}} the Americas as a market. Glasgow supplied the colonies with cloth, iron farming implements and tools, glass and leather goods. Initially relying on hired ships, by 1736 it had 67 of its own, a third of which were trading with the New World. Glasgow emerged as the focus of the tobacco trade, re-exporting particularly to France. The merchants dealing in this lucrative business became the wealthy tobacco lords, who dominated the city for most of the century. Other burghs also benefited. Greenock enlarged its port in 1710 and sent its first ship to the Americas in 1719, but was soon playing a major part in importing sugar and rum.|$|E
5|$|The {{period between}} c. 500 and 1300 saw a <b>major</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> diet that {{affected}} most of Europe. More intense agriculture on an ever-increasing acreage {{resulted in a}} shift from animal products, like meat and dairy, to various grains and vegetables as the staple of the majority population. Before the 14th century bread was not as common among the lower classes, especially in the north where wheat was more difficult to grow. A bread-based diet became gradually more common during the 15th century and replaced warm intermediate meals that were porridge- or gruel-based. Leavened bread was more common in wheat-growing regions in the south, while unleavened flatbread of barley, rye or oats remained more common in northern and highland regions, and unleavened flatbread was also common as provisions for troops.|$|E
5|$|The riots {{caused a}} <b>major</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the government's {{approach}} to racial issues, {{and led to}} the introduction of an aggressive affirmative action policy strongly favouring the Malays, the New Economic Policy (NEP). The National Culture Policy, also introduced in 1970, emphasised an assimilation of the non-Malays into the Malay ethnic group. However, during the 1990s Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad rejected this approach, with his Bangsa Malaysia policy emphasising a Malaysian instead of Malay identity for the state. During the 2000s decade politicians began stressing ketuanan Melayu again, and publicly chastised government ministers who questioned the social contract.|$|E

5|$|With Poland's regained {{independence}} {{came the}} <b>major</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> {{the fortunes of}} Kraków—now {{the second most important}} city of a sovereign nation. The state began to make new plans for the city development and commissioned a number of representative buildings. The predominant style for new projects was modernism with various interpretations of the art-deco style. Important buildings constructed in the style of Polish modernism include the Feniks 'LOT' building on Basztowa Street, the Feniks department store on the Main Square and the Municipal Savings Bank on Szczepański Square. The Józef Piłsudski house is also of note as a particularly good example of interwar architecture in the city.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} Cretaceous {{and the ongoing}} breakup of Pangaea, dinosaurs were {{becoming}} strongly differentiated by landmass. The earliest part of this time saw the spread of ankylosaurians, iguanodontians, and brachiosaurids through Europe, North America, and northern Africa. These were later supplemented or replaced in Africa by large spinosaurid and carcharodontosaurid theropods, and rebbachisaurid and titanosaurian sauropods, also found in South America. In Asia, maniraptoran coelurosaurians like dromaeosaurids, troodontids, and oviraptorosaurians became the common theropods, and ankylosaurids and early ceratopsians like Psittacosaurus became important herbivores. Meanwhile, Australia was home to a fauna of basal ankylosaurians, hypsilophodonts, and iguanodontians. The stegosaurians appear to have gone extinct {{at some point in}} the late early Cretaceous or early late Cretaceous. A <b>major</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the early Cretaceous, which would be amplified in the late Cretaceous, was the evolution of flowering plants. At the same time, several groups of dinosaurian herbivores evolved more sophisticated ways to orally process food. Ceratopsians developed a method of slicing with teeth stacked on each other in batteries, and iguanodontians refined a method of grinding with tooth batteries, taken to its extreme in hadrosaurids. Some sauropods also evolved tooth batteries, best exemplified by the rebbachisaurid Nigersaurus.|$|E
5|$|During Ezana's reign a <b>major</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> {{both the}} Aksumite kingdom and its coinage took {{place as a}} result of the change of the {{official}} religion to Christianity, one of the first states ever to do so. While Ezana's coins in the first half of his reign are almost identical to those of Aphilas, barring minimal weight reductions, those of his second half employ revolutionary designs. With his conversion to Christianity, Ezana began to feature the Cross on his coins, the first time the Christian cross had ever been featured in coinage in the world. Some of his gold Christian coins are of the weight before Constantine I's weight reform in 324, indicating a conversion before this date or perhaps a few years after, as the Aksumite coinage may not have changed weights immediately. Along with the adoption of the Cross on his coins came, of course, the abandonment of the star and crescent symbol on the coins. Later Christian coins reflect the adoptment of the 4.54 g standard by Constantine, with theoretical weights in Aksumite coins likewise dropping to 1.70 g for the gold coins.|$|E
