The five-day event, held in Geneva, Switzerland starting I April 2009 proved to a sweet outing for UMP especially for Dr Hayder A Abdul Bari, who won the sole gold medal {{as well as a}} silver medal for his study entitled "Formulation of High Performance, <b>Multipurpose</b> <b>grease</b> using gypsum from Titanium dioxide manufacturing wastes (From Waste to Wealth) " and "A New Technique for Reducing the Pumping Power Losses in Pipelines Carrying High Temperature Liquids Using Minute Quantities of Suspended Solids" respectively...|$|E
40|$|Environmentally {{friendly}} <b>multipurpose</b> <b>grease</b> formulation {{has been}} synthesized by using Jatropha vegetable residual oil with lithium soap and multifunctional additive. The thus obtained formulation was evaluated for its tribological {{performance on a}} four-ball tribo-tester. The anti-friction and anti-wear performance characteristics were evaluated using standard test methods. The biodegradability and toxicity of the base oil was assessed. The {{results indicate that the}} synthesized residual oil grease formulation shows superior tribological performance when compared to the commercial grease. On the basis of physico-chemical characterization and tribological performance the vegetable residual oil was found to have good potential for use as biodegradable multipurpose lubricating grease. In addition, the base oils are biodegradable and non toxic...|$|E
40|$|The spike forging test {{is still}} {{commonly}} used {{although there are}} some new tribology test methods, but each designer would like to give their own parameters. Considering the spike height difference between low friction and high friction as the evaluation index, an optimal spike forging test developed using finite element simulations based on orthogonal optimization method and sensitivity analysis of tribological conditions of selected key design parameters was carried out. The spike height does not always monotonically decrease with the increase in friction factor in the scheme with improper parameters; therefore, the design of spike forging test should be critically evaluated before assessing tribological conditions. According to the optimized parameters, a simplified set-up of spike forging test was designed, and two retainers with a clearance fit and the billet with a chamfer were prepared to position the test billet. Finally, four different tribological conditions, including dry polytetrafluoroethylene lubricant, <b>multipurpose</b> <b>grease,</b> VG 32 oil, and dry condition, in aluminum forging were chosen as a case study for the optimized design of spike forging test, and correspondingly, the lubricating effect was distinguished...|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the formulation of}} <b>multipurpose</b> <b>grease</b> using red gypsum from titanium dioxide manufacturing wastes. Greases produced with different amount of fume silica (FS) and red gypsum in its compositions. The effect of red gypsum’s and fumed silica’s concentrations on the formulated greases has been studied. The grease mixture is formulated using silicone oil as base oil, fumed silica and red gypsum as thickener, molybdenum disulphide as additive and iron octoate as anti-oxidant agent. Amount of fumed silica involves 2 - 20 % wt (2 % wt, 7 % wt, 16 % wt and 20 % wt). All the fume silica proportions covered (70 % gypsum, 30 % FS), (60 % gypsum, 40 % FS) and (50 % gypsum, 50 % FS). The testing (penetration test, type of thickener, dropping point test, and amount of oil separated) have been done on the formulated greases to determine the properties. It was discovered that formulated grease has no dropping point until 260 o C which proves that the greases has stable structure at higher temperature. All the formulated greases proved to be composed of non-melt thickener type. As the amount of fumed silica and red gypsum increase oil separation decreases and {{the consistency of the}} greases increases. The penetration also significantly decreases as fumed silica addition increases. This is due to the larger strength and small size of fumed silica. The larger strength of fumed silica was thought to be due to the structure being knit together by means of primary valence bonds. It can be concluded that the formulated grease is multi purpose grease. Higher the amount of fumed silica and gypsum (thickener), better the grease’s quality. Therefore, the formulated greases has high potential to be used in wide range of industries such as the cars, ships, aircrafts and most of the industries that deals with heavy duty equipments...|$|E
