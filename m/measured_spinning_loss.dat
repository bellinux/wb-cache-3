Spin polarization of electrons injected from GaAs into GaNAs is found to be less than half of what is generated in GaNAs by optical orientation.

40|$|Recent {{focus on}} two {{dimensional}} materials and spin-coupled phenomena holds future potential for fast, efficient, flexible, and transparent devices. The fundamental {{operation of a}} spintronic device depends on the injection, transmission, and detection of spins in a conducting channel. Long spin lifetimes during transit are critical for realizing this technology. An attractive platform for this purpose is graphene, which has high mobilities and low spin-orbit coupling. Unfortunately, <b>measured</b> <b>spin</b> lifetimes are orders of magnitude smaller than theoretically expected. A source of <b>spin</b> <b>loss</b> is the resistance mismatch between the ferromagnetic electrodes and graphene.

This allows for a detailed characterization of the nonlocal spin valve device. Strong spin-orbit interaction {{has the potential to}} engender unconventional superconducting states. A cousin to graphene, two dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides entwine interaction, spin-orbit coupling, and topology. The noninteracting electronic states have multiple valleys in the energy dispersion and are topologically nontrivial. We report on the possible superconducting states of hole-doped systems, and analyze to what extent the correlated phase inherits the topological aspects of the parent crystal. We find that local attractive interactions or proximal coupling to $s$-wave superconductors lead to a pairing which is an equal mixture of a spin singlet and the $m = 0 $ spin triplet. Its topology allows quasiparticle excitations of net nonzero Berry curvature via pair-breaking by circularly polarized light. The valley contrasting optical response, where oppositely circularly polarized light couples to different valleys, is present even in the superconducting state, though with smaller magnitude...|$|R

Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of ultrafast spin-resolved photoemission using free electron laser (FEL) radiation and investigate the effect of space charge on the detected spin polarization. The sample is exposed to the radiation of the FEL FLASH in Hamburg. Surprisingly, the <b>measured</b> <b>spin</b> polarization depends on the fluence of the FEL radiation: a higher FEL fluence reduces the <b>measured</b> <b>spin</b> polarization.

In comparing our measured spin-voltage signal with the value predicted by theory, {{we followed the}} analysis of Tran et al, (Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 036601 (2009)), and inadvertently propagated an error found therein. As they note in a recent erratum (arXiv: 0810. 4770 v 2), the correct expression for the spin resistance area product from the theory for a sample with a spin diffusion length LSD {{much less than the}} contact width or channel thickness (our experimental situation) is given by the product {gamma}^ 2 {rho} LSD, where {gamma} is the tunneling spin polarization, and {rho} is the resistivity of the semiconductor transport channel. With this correction, our <b>measured</b> <b>spin</b> voltages are much larger than those predicted by theory, rather than in good agreement as we stated. We emphasize that the basic conclusions of our paper are the same - the systematic decrease in electron spin lifetime with increasing electron density demonstrates spin accumulation in the Si channel rather than in interface states. We further show that the <b>measured</b> <b>spin</b> lifetimes are essentially independent of the tunnel barrier material (SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, MgO) or the magnetic metal used (Fe, CoFe, NiFe), demonstrating clear correlation of the <b>measured</b> <b>spin</b> lifetime with the character of the Si, and little correlation with the tunnel barrier / interface or magnetic metal.
