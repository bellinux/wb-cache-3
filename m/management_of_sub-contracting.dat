40|$|The present Master's thesis aims {{to clarify}} the legal notion <b>of</b> <b>sub-contracting,</b> both in civil and common law, through {{a study of the}} subject as regards French and Quebec law, on the one hand, and {{according}} to the laws in force in England, in the Canadian common law provinces and in the United States, on the other hand. To this end we have described the development process <b>of</b> <b>sub-contracting</b> and worked out a typology of this notion. Subsequently, we have shown how the legal systems under study have defined sub-contracting, and in which manner their definitions <b>of</b> <b>sub-contracting</b> differ from those given by economists. We have also looked closely at the legal qualification of the process <b>of</b> <b>sub-contracting</b> and the contracts involved, insisting on certain consequences of the qualifications retained. Finally, we have distinguished sub-contracting from other related notions...|$|R

The research used satisfaction and benefit analysis to produce internal strengths and weal(nesses <b>of</b> <b>sub-contract</b> system, while using external analysis to produce opportunity and threat. TOWS matrix {{was used to determine}} alternative strategies. The result showed that the problems in sub-contract system implementation at PT FAK were sub-conkactor's low bargaining position especially in price determination, ineffective communication and the company has not managed the sub-contract system in optimal level. The company satisfied with price determinination process and payment of loan assistance from the sub-contractors but has not satisfied with the continuity of subcontractors production capacity, the production quality level and time delivery accuracy. The sub-contract system gives significant benefits to the company in increasing ability to meet demand and productivity level but gives insignificant benefit in production and investment cost declining, the decreasing of business risk and the increase of product quality level. Sub-contractors satisfy with the companies payment and production period, but has not satisfy in price determining process, raw material assistance and production quality level received by the company. The sub-contractors get significant benefit in increasing product's quality level and insignificant benefit in productivity, pricing level and income increased and business risk decreased. Alternative strategies for sub-contract system were to include the sub-contractor in product development process, development <b>of</b> <b>sub-contract</b> program, sub-contractor performance improvement, development of subcontract system and procedures and production efficiency. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT We apply a {{commodity}} systems analysis to exam-ine {{a series of}} changes that are transforming Alabama's pulp and paper industry. Alabama is a critical area for investigation be-cause it {{lies at the heart}} of North America's principle pulp and pa-per production zone. Industry restructuring is a complex process involving the reorganization of capital and corporate ownership, as well as changes in technologies, which affect the labor process. For example, a recent spate of corporate mergers has resulted in concentration of mill ownership and has accelerated the preva-lence <b>of</b> <b>sub-contracting.</b> Indeed, the expansion <b>of</b> <b>sub-contracting</b> into new realms raises the fundamental question of what constitutes a core activity in this capital-intensive indus-try. The consolidation process has not proceeded in a unidirec-tional manner, however. For example, some corporations have expanded investments in forest land, while other firms have ac-tively sought to divest themselves of direct ownership of such land, freeing capital for investment elsewhere. Placing Alabama mills in a broader regional context, we examine a set of environ-mental and economic pressures within the commodity system that have led to these changes. *An earlier version of this paper was presented at the annual meeting o...|$|R

30|$|Saidi-Mehrabad and Ghezavati (2009) {{assumed the}} {{processing}} {{time and the}} time between two successive arrivals to cell described by exponential distribution in the CF problem. For analyzing this problem, they used queuing theory in which machine has been considered as a server and the part as a customer. The aim of this model is to minimize the summation of three costs: (1) the idleness costs for machines (2) total cost <b>of</b> <b>sub-contracting</b> for exceptional elements, and (3) the cost of resource underutilization. Ghezavati and Saidi-Mehrabad (2010) proposed a mathematical model for the CM problem integrated with group scheduling in an uncertain space. Within this model, CF and scheduling decisions are optimized concurrently. It is assumed that processing time of parts on machines is stochastic and described by discrete scenarios. Their model minimizes the expected total cost including maximum tardiness cost among all parts, the cost <b>of</b> <b>sub-contracting</b> for exceptional elements, {{and the cost of}} resource underutilization. Egilmez and Suer (2011 a, b) presented a mathematical model for CF which minimized the number of tardy jobs and total probability of tardiness. They assumed that processing time of each job has a normal distribution. Ghezavati and Saidi-Mehrabad (2011) assumed that each machine works as a server and each part is a customer where servers should provide service to customers. Accordingly, they defined formed cells as a queue system which can be optimized by queuing theory. The optimal cells and part families were formed by maximizing the probability that a server is busy. Ghezavati (2011) evaluated the CF problem, scheduling, and layout decisions, concurrently. Also, he considered processing time as stochastic with discrete scenarios under supply chain characteristics. This model minimized holding cost and the costs with respect to the suppliers network in a supply chain in order to outsource exceptional operations. Fardis et al. (2013) examined the CF problem considering that the arrival rate of parts into cells and machine service rate are stochastic parameters, which have described by an exponential distribution. The objective function of presented model minimized summation of the idleness cost <b>of</b> machines, the <b>sub-contracting</b> cost for exceptional parts, non-utilizing machine cost, and the holding cost of parts in the cells.|$|R

30|$|Since 1989, German {{firms have}} “traditionally” turned to CEE {{suppliers}} for this special mix of competent work forces at significantly lower wage levels. This practice runs up against two obstacles, however, {{that leads to}} the proliferation of new lower wage, capacity-subcontractors inside Germany. First, CEE upgrading and capacity growth over the last decade winnowed out the number of firms with an interest in engaging in this less challenging contracting. CEE suppliers moved up the value chain and engage customers, both in Germany and in CEE, in more creative and collaborative forms <b>of</b> <b>sub-contracting.</b> Second, due to shortening automobile product and component life cycles, as well as the unpredictability of demand for internal capacity, the new capacity suppliers need to be rapidly responsive to customer needs and {{be in a position to}} fulfill orders with a very quick turnaround. This disadvantages CEE suppliers, simply because their greater distance from internal workshops creates the potential for delay, miscommunication and additional cost.|$|R

40|$|The {{construction}} industry operates {{primarily as a}} system <b>of</b> <b>sub-contracting</b> and purpose built alliances. There is {{a wide spread of}} stakeholders involved in conceiving a building project through typical stages such as design, finance, build,  manage, upgrade and, ultimately, replacement and a corresponding need for communication and cooperation. Specialists who can prevent bridges falling down or who build 20 storey buildings are seen as the hard-nosed, action people who have helped bring us into the modern era. However, there are intuitive activities and disciplines which help us to achieve the type of construction achievements that have been the hallmarks of the 19 th, 20 th and now the 21 st centuries. Most of these so called soft disciplines are about how one helps people, often highly skilled, achieve those construction and engineering goals. The key components are consultation and communication. Communication strategies should be based on a thorough understanding of the ways that humans co-operate in joint undertakings, the key principles of social dynamics and learning theory plus the ways in which people deliver, accept and understand words and pictures. The disciplines of organisational and environmental psychology have become a basic fundamental of modern business activities from management and organisational strategy to marketing and customer relations and to the improvement of working, recreational and living environments. However it is rare for a mature industry such as construction to adopt or examine those disciplines for guidance about either strategies or operations. This is {{despite the fact that the}} {{construction industry}} is almost entirely based on the principle <b>of</b> <b>sub-contracting,</b> business and professional alliances, all of which require understanding of environmental psychology and social dynamics in order to build trust, reputation, teamwork and client satisfaction. There is therefore a major need for communications to be systematic, understood by all stakeholders and intelligently applied. This paper concentrates on the need for the client to become a more confident and better informed stakeholder in the construction project, and seeks to provide high level management guidance for traditional centralized systems. The ultimate goal of the paper is to provide a systematic guideline for stakeholders to address early in the life of a project to ensure that industry professionals, clients and sub-clients are “working from the same page...|$|R
