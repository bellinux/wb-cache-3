40|$|Root biomass {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{relevant}} root parameters for studies of plant response to environmental change, soil carbon modeling or estimations of soil carbon sequestration. A major source of error in root biomass quantification of agricultural crops in the field is the presence of extraneous organic matter in soil: dead roots from previous crops, weed roots, incorporated above ground plant residues and organic soil amendments, or remnants of soil fauna. Using the isotopic difference between recent maize root biomass and predominantly C 3 -derived extraneous organic matter, we determined the proportions of maize root biomass carbon of total carbon in root samples from the Swiss long-term field trial “DOK. ” We additionally evaluated the effects of agricultural management (bio-organic and conventional), sampling depth (0 – 0. 25, 0. 25 – 0. 5, 0. 5 – 0. 75 m) and position (within and between maize rows), and root size class (coarse and fine roots) as defined by sieve mesh size (2 and 0. 5 mm) on those proportions, and quantified the success rate of <b>manual</b> <b>exclusion</b> of extraneous organic matter from root samples. Only 60 % of the root mass that we retrieved from field soil cores was actual maize root biomass from the current season. While the proportions of maize root biomass carbon were not affected by agricultural management, they increased consistently with soil depth, were higher within than between maize rows, and were higher in coarse (> 2 mm) than in fine (≤ 2 and > 0. 5) root samples. The success rate of <b>manual</b> <b>exclusion</b> of extraneous organic matter from root samples was related to agricultural management and, at best, about 60 %. We assume that the composition of extraneous organic matter is strongly influenced by agricultural management and soil depth and governs the effect size of the investigated factors. Extraneous organic matter may result in severe overestimation of recovered root biomass and has, therefore, large implications for soil carbon modeling and estimations of the climate change mitigation potential of soils...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} strengthening exercises for older people with low back pain (LBP). Methods. This study is a systematic review of experimental study which evaluated the evidence regarding exercises for older people with LBP by using EBSCO Academic Search Premier, EBSCO EconLit, Science Direct, PUBMED, and PEDro from 2006 to 2016. Search strategy for each database was conducted by using keywords such as “low back pain”, “older people”, and “strengthening exercise”. Boolean operators were used to combine keywords and <b>manual</b> <b>exclusion</b> was conducted to verify studies which met the inclusion criteria. The articles reviewed were evaluated and critically appraised by using PEDro scale and SPSS version 20 was used to analyze the data. Results. Three articles were found regarding strengthening exercise for older people with LBP whereas one study was conducted on multicomponent exercise. The mean, standard deviation, and variance of the PEDro score of all the studies were 5. 67, 2. 33, and 1. 528, respectively. Overall, the qualities of all studies reviewed were fair. Two articles showed significant results when compared to control group (p< 0. 05). Conclusions. Strengthening exercise is a beneficial treatment for older people with LBP in reducing pain intensity, disability, and improved functional performances...|$|E
30|$|Inclusion of {{the central}} {{pulmonary}} arteries leads to a systematic overestimation of pulmonary perfusion. Therefore, the use of small ROIs in the lung periphery can be beneficial. However, if the spatial distribution of the underlying lung disease is unknown, or if lung perfusion quantification is required for an entire lung (e.g. to assess side differences of lung perfusion) a measurement of a limited lung sample in a small ROI will only reflect a poor estimate of lung perfusion. One study used a cross-correlation analysis (CCA) of perfusion data sets for suppression of central pulmonary vessels [47]. CCA has previously been used to improve the SNR and arteriovenous separation in time-resolved MR angiography [48, 49]. It was shown that it is feasible to identify vessels with a similar signal-intensity time curve as a reference vessel using CCA. For this purpose reference ROIs have to be drawn in the pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein. The approach was evaluated in seven healthy volunteers. The quantification of PBV and PBF resulted in an average reduction of 25 % for PBV and 15 % for PBF compared with the segmentations without vessel exclusion. A comparison of the <b>manual</b> <b>exclusion</b> of vessel structures and the CCA revealed an average reduction of 13 % for the PBV and 8 % for PBF. The reduction by applying the CCA was significant (P[*]≤[*] 0.001) compared with the results with manual and without blood vessel exclusion for all calculated parameters.|$|E
40|$|Subject-specific search {{facilities}} {{on health}} sites are usually built using <b>manual</b> inclusion and <b>exclusion</b> rules.

On the other hand, health infor-mation obtained through whole-of-Web search may not be scientifically based and can be potentially harmful. To address problems of cost, coverage and quality, we built a focused crawler for the mental health topic of depression, which was able to selectively fetch higher quality relevant in-formation.

Methods: Y 79 retinoblastoma cells have been exposed to increasing doses of either sodium ascorbate (SA) or Melphalan (MEL), to define a dose-response curve around the peak plasma concentrations reached by both chemicals when administered according to the existing therapeutic procedures and protocols. The assessment of cell number and viability was performed, before and after exposure, with both the <b>manual</b> (Trypan Blue <b>Exclusion</b> Test) and automated (flow cytometry) methods. Fluorescence microscopy and direct observation of cells in culture, with inverted microscope, were also performed.

40|$|International audienceIn PET/CT {{thoracic}} imaging, respiratory motion reduces image quality. A solution {{consists in}} performing respiratory gated PET acquisitions. The {{aim of this}} study was to generate clinically realistic Monte-Carlo respiratory PET data, obtained using the 4 D-NCAT numerical phantom and the GATE simulation tool, to assess the impact of respiratory motion and respiratory-motion compensation in PET on lesion detection and volume measurement. To obtain reconstructed images as close as possible to those obtained in clinical conditions, a particular attention was paid to apply to the simulated data the same correction and reconstruction processes as those applied to real clinical data. The simulations required 140, 000 h (CPU) generating 1. 5 To of data (98 respiratory gated and 49 ungated scans). Calibration phantom and patient reconstructed images from the simulated data were visually and quantitatively very similar to those obtained in clinical studies. The lesion detectability was higher when the better trade-off between lesion movement limitation (compared to ungated acquisitions) and image statistic preservation is considered (respiratory cycle sampling in 3 frames). We then compared the lesion volumes measured on conventional PET acquisitions versus respiratory gated acquisitions, using an automatic segmentation method and a 40 %-threshold approach. A time consuming initial <b>manual</b> <b>exclusion</b> of noisy structures needed with the 40 %-threshold was not necessary when the automatic method was used. The lesion detectability along with the accuracy of tumor volume estimates was largely improved with the gated compared to ungated PET images...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Along {{with single}} {{nucleotide}} polymorphisms (SNPs), copy number variation (CNV) is considered {{an important source of}} genetic variation associated with disease susceptibility. Despite the importance of CNV, the tools currently available for its analysis often produce false positive results due to limitations such as low resolution of array platforms, platform specificity, and the type of CNV. To resolve this problem, spurious signals must be separated from true signals by visual inspection. None of the previously reported CNV analysis tools support this function and the simultaneous visualization of comparative genomic hybridization arrays (aCGH) and sequence alignment. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to develop a useful program for the efficient detection and visualization of CNV regions that enables the <b>manual</b> <b>exclusion</b> of erroneous signals. Results A JAVA-based stand-alone program called Genovar was developed. To ascertain whether a detected CNV region is a novel variant, Genovar compares the detected CNV regions with previously reported CNV regions using the Database of Genomic Variants (DGV, [URL]) and the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database (dbSNP). The current version of Genovar is capable of visualizing genomic data from sources such as the aCGH data file and sequence alignment format files. Conclusions Genovar is freely accessible and provides a user-friendly graphic user interface (GUI) to facilitate the detection of CNV regions. The program also provides comprehensive information to help in the elimination of spurious signals by visual inspection, making Genovar a valuable tool for reducing false positive CNV results.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cerebral microbleeds, {{visible on}} gradient-recalled echo (GRE) T 2 * MRI, have {{generated}} increasing interest as an imaging marker of small vessel diseases, with relevance for intracerebral bleeding risk or brain dysfunction. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Manual rating methods have limited reliability and are time-consuming. We {{developed a new}} method for microbleed detection using automated segmentation (MIDAS) and compared it with a validated visual rating system. In thirty consecutive stroke service patients, standard GRE T 2 * images were acquired and manually rated for microbleeds by a trained observer. After spatially normalizing each patient's GRE T 2 * images into a standard stereotaxic space, the automated microbleed detection algorithm (MIDAS) identified cerebral microbleeds by explicitly incorporating an "extra" tissue class for abnormal voxels within a unified segmentation-normalization model. The agreement between manual and automated methods was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Kappa statistic. We found that MIDAS had generally moderate to good agreement with the manual reference method {{for the presence of}} lobar microbleeds (Kappa =  0. 43, improved to 0. 65 after <b>manual</b> <b>exclusion</b> of obvious artefacts). Agreement for the number of microbleeds was very good for lobar regions: (ICC =  0. 71, improved to ICC =  0. 87). MIDAS successfully detected all patients with multiple (≥ 2) lobar microbleeds. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: MIDAS can identify microbleeds on standard MR datasets, and with an additional rapid editing step shows good agreement with a validated visual rating system. MIDAS may be useful in screening for multiple lobar microbleeds...|$|E
40|$|Currently, Adjustment Disorder {{is viewed}} in {{diagnostic}} <b>manuals</b> as an <b>exclusion</b> diagnosis. There is evident need to better delineate between Adjustment Disorder and other disorders commonly overlapping with this disorder. The {{aim of this}} study was to validate the Estonian version of the ADNM (Adjustment Disorder New Module) questionnaire (Maercker et al., 2007) assessing patients recently diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder. In order to adapt and validate this questionnaire, a sample of clinical patient group (n= 46) was obtained and data was collected using a package of self-report questionnaires (ADNM questionnaire, EST-Q- 2; BDI; GHQ- 26 and PCLC). Logisical regression analysis was used to predict the odds ratios of the presence of Adjustment Disorder and correlations between the ADNM questionnaire, other measuring instuments and the psychiatric diagnoses. The results showed that the subscale of the ADNM questionnaire which had been added Estonia-specific items yielded significant correlations with the EST-Q- 2 Fatigue and Depression category. Based on the current sample, the overall validity of the questionnaire is poor – thus giving evidence that the diagnosing criteria of Adjustment Disorder might be specific to cultural backgounds...|$|R
40|$|Biofouling of {{experimental}} cages and other field apparatuses can be problematic for scientists and {{has traditionally been}} addressed using frequent manual removal (e. g., scraping, scrubbing). Recent environmental restrictions and legislative changes have driven the development of less hazardous antifouling products, making antifouling paint a potential alternative option to manual removal. Consequently, the viability of using these newly developed products {{as a replacement for}} the <b>manual</b> cleaning of <b>exclusion</b> cages was experimentally investigated. There were six treatments tested, comprising three with settlement tiles in experimental cages coated with antifouling paint, two with settlement tiles in unpainted experimental cages, and one cage-free suspended tile. The three antifouling treatments comprised two reduced-copper paints (21 % Cu 2 O and 40 % Cu 2 O) and one copper-free, Econea™-based paint (labeled “ecofriendly”). Antifouling paints were assessed for performance of preventing fouling of the cages and whether they elicited local effects on settlement tiles contained within them. All three paints performed well to reduce fouling of the cages during the initial six weeks of the experiment, but the efficacy of “ecofriendly” paint began to decrease during an extended deployment that lasted 14 weeks. The macro-community composition, biomass, and percent cover of settled organism on tiles within cages treated with copper-based paints (21 % and 40 % concentrations) were indistinguishable from tiles within the manually scrubbed cages. In contrast, settlement to tiles from the “ecofriendly” treatment was different in composition of macro-community and lower in biomass, suggesting the presence of local effects and therefore rendering it unsuitable for use in settlement experiments. The {{results of this study suggest}} that reduced-copper paints have the potential to serve as an alternative to manual maintenance, which may be useful for deployments in locations that are difficult to access on a frequent schedule...|$|R
40|$|Background : Anterior {{knee pain}} (AKP) or {{patellofemoral}} pain syndrome is common and may limit an individual’s {{ability to perform}} common {{activities of daily living}} such as stair climbing and prolonged sitting. The diagnosis is difficult as there are multiple definitions for this disorder and there are no accepted criteria for diagnosis. It is therefore most commonly a diagnosis that is made once other pathologies have been excluded. Objectives : The aim {{of this study was to}} create an evidence-based checklist for researchers and clinicians to use for the diagnosis of AKP. Methods : A systematic review was conducted in July 2016, and an evidence-based checklist was created based on the subjective and objective findings most commonly used to diagnose AKP. For the subjective factors, two or more of the systematic reviews needed to identify the factor as being important in the diagnosis of AKP. Results : Two systematic reviews, consisting of nine different diagnostic studies, were identified by our search methods. Diagnosis of AKP is based on the area of pain, age, duration of symptoms, common aggravating factors, <b>manual</b> palpation and <b>exclusion</b> of other pathologies. Of the functional tests, squatting demonstrated the highest sensitivity. Other useful tests include pain during stair climbing and prolonged sitting. The cluster of two out of three positive tests for squatting, isometric quadriceps contraction and palpation of the patella borders and the patella tilt test were also recommended as useful tests to include in the clinical assessment. Conclusion : A diagnostic checklist is useful as it provides a structured method for diagnosing AKP in a clinical setting. Research is needed to establish the causes of AKP as it is difficult to diagnose a condition with unknown aetiology. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Force {{prediction}} can basically {{be done by}} two methods: direct {{methods and}} optimization methods. Direct methods use the inverse of the forward system model to calculate the excitation directly from the measured responses. Optimization methods use a forward model in an optimization loop wherein the input to the forward model is adjusted until the model responses matches the measured responses. In practice, a direct method using an experimentally obtained Frequency Response Function (FRF) is generally used. The direct method can be applied iteratively to enable convergence towards an excitation signal when dealing with nonlinear systems. Previous research of the authors, applying such a code to a highly nonlinear multibody quarter car model, showed an acceptable match between the calculated and the original excitation. However, the iterative process takes many steps and needs user interaction to reach overall convergence, like the <b>manual</b> <b>exclusion</b> from the time signal of excitation peaks that cause divergence. The test case is a representative benchmark for real life problems. This paper focuses on the improvement of speed and robustness of force prediction methods when dealing with nonlinear systems. Contrary to commercial codes, where the system model is treated as a black-box, we use a-priori knowledge of the system dynamics obtained from parametric modeling. We set out from the direct method using the inverse FRF. A simple demonstrator has been built consisting of a beam, clamped at {{one side and the}} other side subjected to different end conditions: free and supported by a repulsing magnet. The demonstrator has also been modeled in a multibody code supporting flexible bodies, to enable preliminary research and to compare experiments and simulations.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to evaluate the method for detection and removal of artifacts in evoked potential monitoring described earlier by Cluitmans and colleagues in a clinical setting. Methods. The method for detection and removal of artifacts by Cluitmans and colleagues {{is based on the}} assumption that a sweep of the recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) signal contains artifacts if one or more variables derived from the signal deviates strongly from the normal range of values. Once these normal ranges are defined, all future EEG recordings that are recorded under comparable circumstances can be automatically evaluated for artifacts by tracking when one or more signal variables falls outside the normal range. To assess the performance of this method in a clinical setting, recordings from a learning set were visually evaluated for artifacts. From the empirical distribution functions of the signal variables, the thresholds for automatic detection of artifacts were determined. The auditory evoked potential (AEP) waveforms resulting after automatic screening were compared with the waveforms obtained after visual evaluation of the raw signal combined with <b>manual</b> <b>exclusion</b> of signal periods containing artifacts. Results. The quality of the resulting waveform was improved by our method of automatic detection and removal of artifacts in 97 % of partly contaminated recordings. In only 2 % of the recordings, automatic screening slightly degraded the resulting waveform. Conclusions. We conclude that the described method of automatic detection and removal of artifacts in AEP recordings effectively improves the quality of the resulting AEP waveform, without excessive rejection of artifact- free signal periods. The signal variables used in this method seem appropriate for distinguishing artifact-free signal periods from periods containing artifacts for the types of artifact that were studied...|$|E
40|$|Department of Educational Management, Policy and Curriculum Studies., 88 p. The central {{problem of}} this study is that despite the efforts by the {{government}} to curb the use of corporal punishment in schools, the practice has persisted in schools in Kenya. This is despite the fact that education is supposed to inculcate and instill discipline to learners critical for their success both during school time and after school. The purpose {{of this study}} was to examine the extent of the use of corporal punishment, though illegal, as a means to curb discipline problems in schools in Muthambi Division. The specific objectives for the study were: to find out the forms of punishment meted on students in secondary schools in Muthambi Division, to find out the efforts in place to use positive discipline to curb infraction in secondary schools in Muthambi Division, to investigate students‟ and teachers‟ preferences in regard to correction of infraction in Muthambi Division and lastly, to find out why the use of corporal punishment has persisted in secondary schools in the secondary schools in Muthambi Division despite the ban by the government. The target population was the 14 secondary schools with a total student population of 4, 761 whose sample was 300 students, 9 deputy principals and 9 guidance and counseling teachers in Muthambi Division. The study adopted a descriptive survey design. Stratified random sampling was used to sample schools where teacher and student respondents were drawn from. The literature review showed various effects of use of corporal punishment such as neurotic reaction reflected by fear, anxiety, withdrawal tension, depression, trauma, stress, timidity, and submissiveness, physical harm or even death, resentment of the punishing teacher and consequently poor performance in the subject s/he teaches. At the end it may lead to wastage in education manifested by dropout. In the long run it may lead to high rates of violence, aggression and homicide committed by children. The literature showed that other forms of correction are withdrawal of privileges, detention, <b>exclusion,</b> <b>manual</b> work, monetary and material fines, mentoring and use of medicine. Data was collected by administering questionnaires to deputy principals, and guidance and counseling teachers and students. To ensure reliability test re-test was used and Pearson‟s correlation co-efficient of 0. 702, 0. 741 and 0. 753 was realized for students, guidance and counseling teachers and deputy principals respectively. The data was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Descriptive statistics including were used to analyze data obtained. The results of data analysis were presented using tables, pie charts and graphs. The findings of the study helped the researcher to come up with recommendations for the future efforts that should be employed to curb indiscipline in secondary schools. It was clear from the findings that corporal punishment is in use in most of the schools in the division. However, unlike reports about negative perception of guidance and counseling among students, students are today increasingly seeking help from the guidance and counseling departments in the secondary schools at their own volition in the division. The researcher recommends that the public should be sensitized on the negative effects of corporal punishment, students should be involved more in the formulation and revision of school rules and regulations, the T. S. C should review the minimum workload for guidance and counseling teachers, principals and deputy principals to create more time for handling student discipline in a friendlier manner.
