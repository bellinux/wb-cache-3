40|$|A new <b>measurement</b> {{method of}} <b>bolt</b> {{tightening}} forces by simultaneous loading of torque and compressive force to a bolt has been developed. By simultaneous application of torque and compres- sire force to a bolt, the friction coefficients in threads and bearing surfaces are accurately detected separately {{in the process}} of tightening. Thus, the present method can control the tightening force of bolts within the error of ± 10 % for wide tightening forces under oil-free or lubricated conditions. The working efficiency of the present method is much better than that of the angle control method or the torque gradient control method because {{it is not necessary to}} measure the tightening angie and the friction coefficients in advance...|$|R
40|$|The bolts {{used for}} {{automobiles}} {{are relatively small}} compared with those used in power plants, steel bridges and frames. The precise control of the fastening force is required for important parts. The force measurement by torque wrenches is, however, unreliable because it does measure the frictional torque caused by the axial force not but axial force itself. Therefore direct measurement of the axial force in those bolts is required. The conventional ultrasonic bolt gages are not applicable for these short bolts because the bolt length uniformly stressed is small compared with the total length. An ultrasonic resonance method [1] is useful for axial stress <b>measurement</b> of these <b>bolts,</b> however, it requires long measurement time because of frequency sweep and both measurements in stressed and unstressed states...|$|R
40|$|A {{method to}} assist in the {{evaluation}} and selection of roof bolts using in situ <b>measurements</b> of roof <b>bolt</b> loading has been developed by researchers of the Spokane Research Center, National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. Both axial and bending forces are measured by strain gauges at many locations along the length of fully grouted bolts during various stages of mining. This information is then used to (1) predict bolt loading for variations in bolt spacing, grade, and diameter, (2) calculate the design changes necessary in zones where bending loads are high, and (3) determine if bolt length is adequate. Results from several case studies of full-column bolt loading in coal mine gate roads are used to illustrate the design method. This knowledge will give design engineers a tool for the selection of roof support systems that will improve underground safety by reducing roof bolt failures...|$|R
40|$|Current {{developments}} in numerical modelling techniques are presented {{to investigate the}} load transfer between the steel bolt surface and resin encapsulation. Underground <b>measurements</b> of steel <b>bolt</b> performance indicate that amongst many parameters bolt profile configuration {{plays an important role}} in load transfer capacity between the bolt and resin that encapsulates the steel bolt. The short encapsulation pullout tests of roof bolt capacity can be successfully modelled and directly compared to the insitu pullout tests. Using the numerical modelling techniques, changes in the bolt profile can be studied in detail to provide a better understanding of the bolt reinforcement mechanism. In particular, emphasis is placed on the bolt profile geometry and its influence on the load transfer characteristics. Even though this work does not discuss any results, it is intended to outline the procedures and methods employed as part of the continuing research at the University of Wollongong...|$|R
40|$|Rail joints are a weak {{component}} in railway tracks {{because of the}} large impact and wheel-rail contact forces. Every train passage contributes to the deterioration of rail joints, causing visible (e. g. battered rails) and invisible (e. g. loose bolts) damages. The invisible damage cannot be detected by the commonly performed visual inspection, which is labor intensive, unreliable, intrusive and unsafe. In this paper, a vehicle-borne monitoring system is used to automatically detect and assess the tightness condition of bolts at rail joints. The monitoring method is developed based on field Axle Box Acceleration (ABA) <b>measurements</b> using different <b>bolt</b> tightness conditions. The suitability of the method is assessed by bolt tightness prediction and verification of a set of rail joints in the tram network of Sheffield, United Kingdom. The results show that ABA system can be employed to monitor bolt tightness conditions at rail joints. With this information better planning for selective preventive maintenance actions can be taken over rail joints. Railway Engineerin...|$|R

Maintaining proper bolt tension is important in many fields such as for ensuring safe operation of civil infrastructures. Significant advantages of this relatively simple methodology is its capability to assess bolt tension without any contact with the <b>bolt,</b> thus enabling <b>measurement</b> at inaccessible locations, multiple <b>bolt</b> <b>measurement</b> capability at a time, not requiring data collection during the installation and no calibration requirements. We performed detailed experiments on a custom-built flexible bench-top experimental setup consisting of 1018 steel plate of 12. 7 mm (½ in) thickness, a 6. 4 mm (¼ in) grade 8 bolt and a stainless steel washer with 19 mm (¾ in) of external diameter. Our results indicate that this method is not only capable of clearly distinguishing properly bolted joints from loosened joints but also capable of quantifying how loose the bolt actually is. We also conducted detailed signal-to-noise (SNR) analysis and showed that the SNR value for the entire bolt tension range was sufficient for image reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} use of dynamic {{friction}} within a bolted structure to improve damping properties of the structure. The structure considered for this paper consists of two steel beam-columns bolted together allowing dynamic friction to occur at the interface. This paper presents {{an analysis of the}} behaviour of the structure and the effect of friction on its dynamics. It also presents an analysis of the energy dissipation in the structure by means of friction and the optimization of the bolt tension in order to dissipate the maximum vibration energy. We define analytical expressions for the vibration behaviour before and after slip occurs as well as the condition at which the slip-stick transition occurs. An experiment, in which the <b>measurements</b> of the <b>bolt</b> tension, the slip within the structure and the bending velocity are made, is used to validate the model. The theoretical analysis gave very close agreement with the experimental results and the effective damping of the structure was increased by a factor of approximately 10 through the use of dynamic friction.

40|$|In {{the design}} of {{rotating}} machinery it is often necessary to bolt components together with a known preload since the same controls the system dynamics considerably. Since a major percentage bolt tightening torque is resisted by frictional forces especially {{towards the end of}} tightening, and since the coefficient of friction in threads and under the bolt head to a large degree is indeterminate, the best method of ensuring desired clamping load is by <b>measurement</b> of <b>bolt</b> elongation, or by a load cell. However in large number of cases the incorporation of load cell is not practical and bolt elongation is insufficient to allow accurate measurement. ln such cases it becomes necessary to produce the desired end load by applying a specified torque to the bolt leading to the determination of nut factor. for each of the cases Here an attempt has been made to obtain the quantitative values of nut factors for bolted joints as a function of bolt diameter and tightening torque applied on bolted joints. A simple test rig 1 was designed and fabricated for the purpose in which the experiments were conducted. The instrumentation basically includes the monitoring of the bolt tightening torque through the torque wrench, and a load cell measures the clamping force developed in the joint. These experiments were conducted with thrust ball bearing and also without thrust ball bearing; resulting in possible analysis of the friction generated between nut and bolt threads and also between nut-washer surfaces. The results include generation of nut factors and coefficient of friction values developed for different torques and different bolt diameters, by using a mathematical relation which relates the bolt geometry, clamping force and the tightening torque applied. Also an effort has been made to develop a curve fit equation for nut factor values from experimental data leading to quantitative estimation of nut factors as a function of bolt diameter and tightening torque. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} and monitoring of preload in bolting is an omnipresent need in structural mechanics without sufficient solution. A detailed study about the preload in bolts and its detection {{with a combination}} of different types of ultrasonic waves is presented. The accuracy of preload measurement based on relative time-of-flight variations between different wave types was investigated. For this purpose a system was built to adjust defined stress states in bolts and correlate them with ultrasonic time-of-flight measurements. In a first step the influence of stress on every single type of wave and the repeatability of time-of-flight <b>measurement</b> in the <b>bolt</b> were determined. This led to a good estimate of the measurement error and defines the minimum and the step size of preload detection. Additionally the bolt's microstructure caused by the production process and the thread geometry are very important factors for the interaction of ultrasound with the bolt. Taking these boundary conditions into account, it is possible to define a material based acoustoelastic parameter which enables detection of stress levels in bolts of the same material and dimension. The necessary verification of this special acoustoelastic parameter is also possible with the preload-adjustment-system. The mentioned system provides full control over ultrasound generation, measurement and data handling in combination with precise mechanical measurement of the applied load. In the following investigations a comparison of parameters between different bolt diameters and lengths were performed to quantify dimensional effects and their contribution to the measurement error. Regarding the potential use in on- or offline monitoring systems a comprehensive database is crucial to investigate bolts of different materials and dimensions as well as easy-to-use GUI...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} the {{research}} project {{is driven by the}} Crossrail project in London for which new 7 m diameter tunnels are to be constructed close to numerous existing operational tunnels of the London Underground (LU) network. The main aim of this research is to investigate the impact of new tunnel excavations on existing tunnels. This research component is based on field instrumentation and experimental work conducted on half-scale grey cast iron (GCI) tunnel lining segments with chemical composition similar to the Victorian age GCI segments in the LU network. Currently, there is great uncertainty about the behaviour of segmental linings. General belief is that the behaviour of the lining is influenced by the behaviour of the joints, but there has been little experimental work to investigate this relationship. The laboratory experiments aim to find out the deformation behaviour of the bolted segmental lining and the influence of parameters such as overburden pressure, bolt preload and presence of grommets at small distortions. The measured behaviour of the segmental lining is compared against the theoretical behaviour of a continuous lining based on the assumption of linear elasticity. The laboratory results are used to assess the validity of the tunnel assessment methods used by the industry. The results from the parametric tests will form the basis for future experimental investigations taking the half-scale test ring to large deformations and ultimately to failure. The field component involved taking <b>measurements</b> of existing <b>bolted</b> segmental grey cast iron tunnels. Small sections of tunnels constructed at the LU Acton Depot, at Tottenham Court Road Station and in the Central Line running tunnel were monitored to gain an understanding of the deformation of tunnels from construction and self-weight, from ground loading and finally from the influence of adjacent tunnelling works. The thesis proposes recommendations for future in-tunnel monitoring based on the findings obtained in this research. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|The resin {{anchored}} {{rock bolt}} is used {{extensively in the}} mining industry to stabilize the roof and prevent it from collapsing. However, there are different defects associated with a resin anchored rock bolt. Examples are partially encapsulated bolts, over-spinned bolts and corroded bolts. These defects reduce {{the integrity of the}} roof, and thereby {{have an effect on the}} safety and productivity of the mines. The integrity of the rock bolts is a critical issue for the mining industry because of its influence on the safety of mining operations. Different research groups around the world have addressed the problem of determining rock bolt integrity. The most promising technique found in the literature study was based on guided ultrasonic waves (Beard and Lowe, 2003). This study extended the previous work by Beard and Lowe (2003) using guided ultrasonic waves, to investigate damage in more realistic embedded bolts which deviate from pure cylinders. The fundamental L(0, 1) mode in its lower frequency range, as suggested by Beard and Lowe was utilized. This was done through the use of finite element model simulations of various defect scenarios, which were compared to experimental <b>measurements</b> on <b>bolts.</b> Defects like loss of resin encapsulation, voids and local corrosion cracks were addressed. The time traces of the different finite element defect scenarios could be directly compared to experimental time traces which distinguish this study from the analytical approach. Some finite element modelling issues were investigated and it was found that the time step is critical if an implicit solver is used, whereas for an explicit solver the element size is critical if accurate answers are needed. Furthermore it was also apparent that the boundary of the mortar has an influence on the results. The method used in the study was to move the boundaries far enough to prevent interference. This however increases the model size and thereby the computer resources required. Axisymmetric defects were modelled using axisymmetric finite elements to reduce the problem size. These models gave results comparable to the measured bolts. Three-dimensional finite element models seemed to be promising for simulating non-axisymmetric defects. It was found that it is not possible to solve large three-dimensional models without energy absorbing boundaries. Axisymmetrical and three dimensional finite element models of a partially encapsulated bolt and a bolt with a local corrosion crack were built. It was possible to detect simulated local corrosion cracks with the finite element models. Clear reflections for the crack in the bolt could be seen. If the bolt, resin and rock are cracked, different reflections will be detected. These different reflections complicated the interpretation of the results. Once the integrity of models such as these has been established, the models could in principle be used to train neural networks for use in commercial equipment. The present study was limited to lower frequencies because of computer resource limitations. Basic principles and modelling issues could however be addressed and it may be expected that these principles could soon be extended to higher frequencies with a new generation of computers.

40|$|Information Circular (IC) 9453. Roof falls {{continue}} to be the greatest single safety hazard faced by underground coal miners. During 1996 - 99, 44 coal miners lost their lives in rock falls and nearly 2, 400 were injured. In addition, nearly 6, 000 noninjury roof collapses were reported. Roof supports are installed to protect the miners, but support system failures contributed to most of these incidents. Reducing the terrible toll taken by ground falls continues to be a major goal of research by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). During 2000 - 01, NIOSH conducted a series of open industry briefings on New Technology for Coal Mine Roof Support in Norton, VA, Charleston, WV, Evansville, IN, Tuscaloosa, AL, Price, UT, Glenwood Springs, CO, and Washington, PA. Drawing on many years of research undertaken by the NIOSH Pittsburgh and Spokane Research Laboratories, the proceedings describe what types of coal mine roof support are available, how they work, and when they should be used. The major subjects covered include roof bolts, standing roof supports, cable supports, and longwall shields. Some special topics are also addressed, including an analysis of roof fall accident statistics, techniques for better skin control, and material handling considerations. The proceedings volume also contains information on several important new technologies, which are described for the first time, e. g., guidelines for selecting roof bolt length, pattern, and capacity that were derived from statistical analysis of the roof fall experience at 37 underground mines; a new design method for longwall tailgate supports; and a technique for measuring loads developed within cable bolts.
