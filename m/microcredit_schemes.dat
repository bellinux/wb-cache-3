There is currently limited literature that document how urban poor have benefited from <b>microcredit</b> <b>schemes</b> especially in regard to providing additional income to support their families. The fact that poor residents in urban areas are not able to access bank loans to start their business forces them to borrow money from loan sharks. This situation puts the aspiring poor urban entrepreneurs at an even disadvantage position when they could not pay back the loan. Building upon this framework, this study surveys 257 poor urban entrepreneurs from Kuala Lumpur, a capital city of Malaysia.

40|$|<b>Microcredit</b> <b>schemes</b> {{have become}} a popular means of {{improving}} smallholders' access to credit and making long term investment possible. However, {{it remains to be}} explored whether the current <b>microcredit</b> <b>schemes</b> are more successful than earlier formal small scale lending in identifying successful borrowers. We studied shrimp farming in a rural region in Bangladesh where formal microlending is well established, but where more expensive informal microlending coexists with the formal schemes. Farmers - both those who exclusively use formal loans and those who also use informal loans - remain credit-constrained; both types overutilize labour {{in order to reduce the}} need for working capital. However, the credit constraint is actually milder for the informal borrowers: the implicit shadow price of working capital is substantially higher in the group that only takes formal loans than in the group that also uses informal loans. These results suggest that informal lenders - with their closer ties to the individual farmers - remain more successful in identifying those smallholder farmers that are most likely to use the borrowed funds successfully. Informal lenders have an information advantage that formal microlenders lack: the latter need to find routes to access this information in order for formal <b>microcredit</b> <b>schemes</b> to succeed. ...|$|E

40|$|Randomized control {{trials are}} {{sometimes}} {{used to estimate}} the aggregate benefit from some policy or program. To address the potential bias from selective take-up, the randomization is used as an instrumental variable for treatment status. Does this (popular) method of impact evaluation help reduce the bias when take-up depends on unobserved gains from take up? Such"essential heterogeneity"is known to invalidate the instrumental variable estimator of mean causal impact, though one still obtains another parameter of interest, namely mean impact amongst those treated. However, if essential heterogeneity is the only problem then the naïve (ordinary least squares) estimator also delivers this parameter; there is no gain from using randomization as an instrumental variable. On allowing the heterogeneity to also alter counterfactual outcomes, the instrumental variable estimator may well be more biased for mean impact than the naïve estimator. Examples are given for various stylized programs, including a training program that attenuates the gains from higher latent ability, an insurance program that compensates for losses from unobserved risky behavior and a <b>microcredit</b> <b>scheme</b> that attenuates the gains from access to other sources of credit.

Specifically, this work sought to assess the nature, characteristics and operations of microinsurance and to establish the link between these elements {{and the growth of}} micro investments as well as the variables of sustainable development, such as poverty level in the country. The experimental, pilot and replicative research designs were used. Secondary data sourced from the publications of the National Insurance Commission of Nigeria, reports from Delta State Ministry of Poverty Alleviation, journals, text books and periodicals, among others were analysed qualitatively and descriptively. It was discovered that microinsurance has high potency in promoting micro investments or micro projects in the country based on the experience in Delta State where a lot of micro entrepreneurs, mainly the beneficiaries of the state <b>microcredit</b> <b>scheme</b> and Youth Empowerment Programmes, have been compensated through microinsurance scheme. This has promoted micro entrepreneurship, business growth, stability and continuity leading to poverty alleviation in the State. To this end, it was recommended that other states and relevant agencies should adopt the microinsurance scheme as experimented in Delta State.

40|$|Smallholder {{farmers have}} long been denied access to formal credit, {{largely because of the}} high {{administrative}} fees associated with loans. A possible solution to this problem, which has become increasingly popular, is the use of microcredit financing, where innovative means of securing the loans, such as peer monitoring, are used. This paper examines the effectiveness of formal <b>microcredit</b> <b>schemes</b> as compared to the traditional informal credit sources in a rural shrimp farming district of Bangladesh. We compare the two types of credit by studying the technical and allocative efficiencies of the two groups of borrowers. The findings suggest that farmers using both types of microcredit have difficulty accessing credit, often over-utilising labour {{in order to reduce the}} need for inputs that require cash at the beginning of the season, creating inefficiencies in production. However, the informal lenders, with their closer ties to individual farmers, were more successful in identifying those small-holders most likely to make the best use of the borrowed funds. Thus, although formal <b>microcredit</b> <b>schemes</b> do not impose the high administrative fees of traditional formal lending, they do not necessarily solve the problem of how to select successful borrowers.

In developing countries, Social entrepreneurship has emerged and grown into a global movement to transform social change as part of poverty eradication strategy. Building upon this foundation, this paper aims to {{examine the impact of}} microcredit scheme on entrepreneurhip development. Specifically, it attempts to (1) explore the effectiveness of the existing <b>microcredit</b> <b>schemes,</b> (2) assess the viability of government policies aimed at promoting microcredit schemes; and (3) make strategic policy recommendation to improve the existing social business model.

40|$|Summary Based on {{many years}} of {{experience}} in the monitoring and evaluation of health and related projects in Nigeria, this article emphasises the need for a new approach, giving much greater responsibility to community?based organisations and allowing them a major role in consequent modifications to project design. It is suggested that this could greatly assist in fostering project ownership and hence the potential for sustainability. Emphasising the accountability of the project to the intended beneficiaries in this manner would also encourage those beneficiaries collectively to ensure financial accountability with regard to the use of donor and local project funds. Provision of training and support to enable community?based organisations to undertake these new responsibilities could also have substantial multiplier effects on the local economy, as new skills, for example management of <b>microcredit</b> <b>schemes</b> for health costs, were applied in other sectors...|$|E

The United Nations proclaims the year 2005 the year of microcredit. According to Schuler, Hashemi and Riley (1997) joining such operations can enhance the propensity to use contraceptives. Yet, research also indicates that women who join microcredit groups are likely to enter with a high sense of autonomy, have comparatively lower fertility levels and a greater tendency to use contraceptives (Steel Amin, and Nave, 2001). Using a mixed-method approach, this study evaluates {{the effectiveness of a}} rural <b>microcredit</b> <b>scheme</b> in Abokobi Village, Ghana. The sample is 204 women age 19 years and older. One half of the sample belongs to a microcredit organization. Outcome findings suggest that both membership and membership duration is positively associated with aspects of empowerment, but not the same dimensions of empowerment. Local meaning of empowerment is not entirely inconsistent with standardize measures used in western research, local women viewed empowerment as having opportunities to work, but also locally, empowerment means needing help finically and having a hard work ethic. Unlike empowerment, this study finds no significant differences between members and non-members in attitudes and practices with family planning; however, having fewer children and more years of education has statistically significant effects on family planning use and attitudes. ...|$|R

Microcredit {{has been well documented}} to have economic and social implications such as increasing in the income, reducing poverty and empowering the poor by offering them opportunities to access economic resources. The sucess of GB has led to a massive replication across the globe. The Amanah Ikhtiar Malaysia or AIM modeled along the GB concept established in 1987 is the first serious replicator of the Grameen concept. It was established with the sole purpose of addressing the problem of the hardcore poverty in the rural area through the provision of loans which is to be used in various economic activities that can generate an income.

30|$|Compared to {{business}} knowledge and practice, {{it is more}} difficult to change labor market outcomes including employment levels, hours worked, and—certainly—earnings. In general, programs providing training combined with financing or counseling seem to perform better in promoting labor market activities, particularly for youth (Cho and Honorati 2014). Vocational training combined with grants in Nicaragua for social safety net beneficiaries is an example of such a program (Macours et al. 2012). Grants provided to vulnerable youth so that they could pursue vocational training in Uganda also yielded positive outcomes (Blattman et al. 2014). Conversely, training or financing provided alone may not be sufficient to address the complex constraints faced by microenterprise owners in developing countries. A recent review by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor of largely stand-alone financing interventions found few impacts regarding business performance and labor market outcomes (Bauchet et al. 2011).

While microcredit {{has opened up}} new opportunities for the poor to start enterprises, {{some of them have}} not benefited from <b>microcredit</b> <b>schemes.</b> To enable the poor left behind to participate in the rural economy as entrepreneurs, this paper proposes the creation of a partnership enterprise between a sponsor and poor producers. In this partnership, the sponsor as a master trader supports partner-producers financially, technically and managerially through a subcontracting arrangement. The paper develops this conceptual relationship in a real rural setting through the observation of an income-generating program implemented by a Bangladeshi NGO in the field of poultry-rearing. This empirical form of partnership enterprise suggests an opportunity for the poor to enter into a previously inaccessible market and gain a regular income source, which builds the foundation of their household economy beyond subsistence.

The aim was to explore {{the extent to which the}} CBOs are practical, dynamic and potential actors in promoting desired socio-economic development activities in the struggle to alleviate poverty. Micro-credit, micro-financing and micro-enterprises are terms that have been used to describe and define the situation in which small loans are extended to people for the purposes of setting up small and usually self-employment projects that generate income. The research conducted aimed at examining micro-credit schemes as grassroots organizations, membership participation and accessibility, demand for credit and ways to increase lending portfolio through proposal preparations and their modus operand -which are inherent catalytic element to make them practical, dynamic, sustainable and potential in their activity sphere. The study has revealed that the credit facility is important in fostering small scale entrepreneurs to be more practical and proactive in delivering socio-economic activities. The role played by the CBO in creating entrepreneurial morale to small businesses in their locality is acknowledged. The CBO is ready to expand its services as acknowledged by demand of loans and readiness of members to access the loans. Borrowers are organized into groups and have showed their satisfaction with the current leadership. They have income generating activities, which reduce the risk of default. There are also effective mechanisms through which to disseminate valuable information on ways to improve relevant concerns of the members. Above all, the CBO has targeted one of the most vulnerable groups in society - women. By providing opportunities for self-employment, the micro credit programmes will significantly increase micro entrepreneurs' security, autonomy, self-confidence and status within the households.
