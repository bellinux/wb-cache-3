It had {{caused a lot of}} loss to banana plantation industry and farmers around the world. The wild progenitors of the cultivated bananas co-evolved with the F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Vakili, 1965) offering a possible source of resistance to the Fusarium wilt disease. Embryo culture technique (in vitro) is a valuable and best tool for breeding purpose by exploiting genetic variation of wild banana. Two samples of wild banana <b>Musa</b> acuminata <b>spp.</b> malaccensis were harvested from two different sites that showed an early sign of Fusarium disease at Dabong, Gua Musang. Seeds from both samples were extracted from the matured fruit bunch and undergone two different sterilization treatments whether with 3 % sodium hypochlorite or 70 % ethanol. The 3 % sodium hypochlorite solution had shown higher germination rate with 31. 12 % compared to ethanol treatment which is 26. 39 %. Then, the embryos of wild banana seeds from both samples were cultured in the MS media by using between two different techniques either surface technique or submerged technique.

The banana germplasm bank at Embrapa Cassava and Fruits has been primarily used in the breeding program for generating new cultivars as food. To diversify and expand {{the use of this}} collection, accessions with ornamental potential have been selected to obtain new hybrids. This work was aimed at characterizing the progeny of ornamental <b>Musa</b> L. <b>spp.</b> by grouping the hybrids according to the following uses: landscape plants, potted plants, cut flower, or minifruits. Forty-two hybrids were evaluated with 14 quantitative and 12 qualitative descriptors in three production cycles. In addition, assays for resistance to black and yellow Sigatoka and to Fusarium wilt were performed. Variability was observed for all the characteristics evaluated within progenies, especially with regard to leaf color, fruit, peduncle, rachis, and heart. All evaluated hybrids were resistant to yellow Sigatoka and to Fusarium wilt and were resistant or showed reduced symptoms of susceptibility to black Sigatoka. Most hybrids (82 %) presented reduced plant height. After clustering by use category, the hybrids RM 09, RM 38, RM 37, and RM 33 were selected and recommended to be used as cut flowers, minifruits, or landscaping plants.

40|$|The genome of <b>Musa</b> balbisiana <b>spp.</b> {{contains}} several infectious endogenous {{sequences of}} Banana streak virus (eBSV). We have shown previously that {{in vitro micropropagation}} triggers the activation of infectious eBSOLV (endogenous sequences of Banana streak Obino l'Ewai virus) in the synthetic tetraploid interspecific hybrid FHIA 21 (AAAB). In this work, we show that another synthetic tetraploid (AAAB) hybrid and two natural triploid (AAB) plantains are equally prone to the activation of infectious eBSOLV during tissue culture. These results are a strong indication that such activation is a general phenomenon in interspecific Musa cultivars, whether synthetic or natural. We also report the first in-depth study of {{the correlation between the}} duration of tissue culture and the level of activation of infectious eBSOLV, and show that specific and common activation patterns exist in these banana plants. We hypothesize that these patterns result from the concomitant activation of infectious eBSOLV and a decrease in the virus titre in neoformed plantlets, resulting from cell multiplication outcompeting virus replication. We provide experimental data supporting this hypothesis. No activation of infectious eBSGFV (endogenous sequences of Banana streak Goldfinger virus) by tissue culture was observed in the two natural AAB plantain cultivars studied here, whereas such activation occurred in the AAAB synthetic hybrid studied. We demonstrate that this differential activation does not result from differences in the structure of eBSGFV, as all banana genomes harbour eaBSGFV- 7. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Banana {{production}} in Senegal is {{achieved in the}} eastern and southern {{parts of the country}} and along the valley of the Senegal River as well. The production is still far below the domestic market demand. In addition, a lot of failures are associated with different steps of the production and post harvest process of fruits. As a consequence, poor fruit quality with low commercial value is produced. This study was undertaken to determine the disease causing agents responsible for post harvest deterioration of banana fruit in Senegal.

40|$|Endogenous Banana streak viruses (eBSVs) {{are present}} in the genome of <b>Musa</b> balbisiana <b>spp.</b> Some eBSVs are {{infectious}} and their activation by biotic and abiotic stresses lead to spontaneous infections by several species of Banana streak virus (BSV) in triploid (AAB) and tetraploid (AAAB) interspecific hybrids harboring the M. balbisiana genome. Although interspecific hybrids are grown over important areas in several countries throughout the Caribbean, Latin America and Africa, the risk of spreading BSVs associated to large scale cultivation of these hybrids has never been assessed. This thesis focuses on the risk of spreading the three most widespread BSV species (BSOLV, BSGFV and BSIMV) in the Dominican Republic through the large scale cultivation of the two main banana hybrids that are grown in the country, Macho x Hembra, a natural triploid (AAB) plantain cultivar, and FHIA- 21, a tetraploid (AAAB) hybrid. An unprecedented survey was conducted throughout all the Dominican banana producing areas in order to assess the prevalence levels of BSOLV, BSGFV and BSIMV in MxH and FHIA- 21 plantations. It showed that BSOLV and BSGFV are widespread in both varieties, with BSGFV being the most prevalent species, and that BSIMV is not present. BSGFV prevalence level was significantly higher in FHIA- 21 than in MxH. Analyses of molecular taxonomical data of the natural mealybug vectors of BSVs and eBSV patterns of MxH and FHIA- 21 were carried out and pointed to a marginal role of mealybugs in the transmission of BSGFV and BSOLV in the Dominican Republic in MxH and FHIA- 21. An experimental plot was set up and used for the first attempt ever made to monitor the kinetics of activation of infectious eBSOLV and eBSGFV in interspecific hybrids under field conditions. Results collected over a 15 months period showed that infectious alleles OL 1 (eBSOLV) and GF 7 (eBSGFV) are differentially expressed in MxH and FHIA- 21, pointing to the existence of additional (plant) factors involved in the regulation of the expression of infectious eBSVs. They also showed that the mode of multiplication of the planting material influences activation levels. Preliminary results also suggest that BSV infection does not have a major effect on fruit production, although additional data are needed to reach definite conclusions in this regard. Overall, this thesis contributes significantly to {{the development and implementation of}} appropriate strategies for evaluating and mitigating the risks of spreading BSVs that are associated with the cultivation of banana interspecific hybrids.

40|$|In {{the last}} three decades, the {{spiralling}} whitefly (Aleurodicus dispersus) has become an important international pest. The movement of plants and parts of plants (such as fruits) in international trade and tourism, and by natural dispersal, has favoured its introduction to new areas. In common with others whiteflies of economic importance, the immature and adult stages cause direct feeding damage by piercing and sucking of sap from foliage, and indirect damage following the accumulation all over host plants of honeydew and waxy flocculent material produced by the insects. Spiralling whitefly is a pest of tropical and subtropical crops, and highly polyphagous. Up to the 1970 s, it had been recorded on 44 genera of plants, belonging to 26 botanical families (Mound & Halsey, 1978). This situation changed with the dispersal of the pest to new areas. Nowadays, the spiralling whitefly {{is one of the}} major pest of vegetable, ornamental and fruit crops around the globe (Lambkin, 1999). Important host crops include: banana (<b>Musa</b> sapientum), Citrus <b>spp.,</b> coconut (Cocos nocifera), eggplant (Solanum melanogena), guava (Psidium guajava), Hibiscus rosa sinensis, Indian almond (Terminalia catappa), papya (Carica papaya), Rosa sp. and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) (Saminathan & Jayaraj, 2001). Spiralling whitefly has its origin in the tropical Americas, including Brazil. Although the pest has been recorded only once in Brasil, in the 1920 s in the state of Bahia (Bondar, 1923), it now has official quarantine status because of its economic importance. In the Cape Verte Islands, on the West African coast, the pest was initially introduced in the first half of 2000; it has since become established, reaching urban, natural and agricultural areas of the islands that constitute the archipelago. Since then, the pest has been causing damage to many native plants, ornamentals and cultivated food crops (Anon., 2001; Monteiro, 2004). The present study was done in order to produce an inventory of the most common host plants of spiralling whitefly in this new habitat...|$|R

40|$|The Laboratory of Tropical Crop Improvement (K. U. Leuven, Belgium) hosts, {{under the}} {{authority}} of Bioversity International, the global in vitro collection of banana varieties (<b>Musa</b> and Ensete <b>spp.).</b> The aim of this international gene bank is to conserve all banana and plantain genetic resources safely and to supply the germplasm to any bona fide users. However, in vitro preserved germplasm needs regular sub-culturing, creating opportunities for losses due to contamination and human error. Moreover, an important problem associated with in vitro culture is the occurrence of somaclonal variation. K. U. Leuven was one of the pioneers to explore the possibilities of storing plant material in liquid nitrogen (at - 196 °C). However, for successful storage at - 196 °C, cells need to survive first a severe dehydration process prior to freezing and need to regenerate after thawing. In banana, meristems are the most suitable structures to be cryopreserved. Although meristems have the potential to regenerate, they still need to survive the dehydration associated with cryopreservation. In general, dehydration tolerance is achieved by a sucrose mediated osmotic stress acclimation. However, {{more than half of the}} collection consists of varieties that have a nonexistent or low cryopreservation survival rate. Hence, there is a need to unravel the mechanisms behind acclimation during the pre-culture of meristems on sucrose and to get insight into the genotype specific diversity. Understanding gene function and gene expression profiling can be approached via several techniques. A concise overview of the existing technologies is given with the emphasis on proteomics and proteomic technologies. Protein separation via two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and protein identification via tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is the most informative approach for a poorly characterized organism like banana. Proteins are relatively well conserved making the identification of non-model gene products by comparison to well known orthologous proteins quite efficient. Intact proteins (separated via 2 DE) are essential for a good and reliable identification. Chapter II focuses on the specific problems of protein extraction of extremely recalcitrant plant tissues and on the 2 DE separation. Protein sample preparation is a critical step and is absolutely essential for obtaining good results. Most plant tissues are not a ready source for protein extraction and need specific precautions. The cell wall and the vacuole make up the majority of the cell mass, with the cytosol representing only 1 to 2 % of the total cell volume. Subsequently, plant tissues have a relatively low protein content compared to bacterial or animal tissues. Banana is a good representative of a recalcitrant plant species since it contains numerous interfering compounds. Banana contains extremely high levels of oxidative enzymes (polyphenol oxidase), phenolic compounds (simple phenols (dopa), flavonoids, condensed tannins, lignin), carbohydrates, terpenes, suberin, and waxes. The majority of the plant protocols introduce a precipitation step to concentrate the proteins and to separate them from the interfering compounds. A phenol extraction protocol was optimized for small amounts of banana plant tissue (down to 50 mg fresh weight (FW)) and different sample preparation methods were evaluated. TCA/acetone precipitation and phenol extraction methanol/ammonium acetate precipitation (and only these methods) are both useful as standard methods for recalcitrant plant tissue. The optimized phenol extraction was most efficient in removing interfering substances and resulted in the highest quality gels. This method proved also to be useful for other plant species like apple, pear and potato. Chapter III focuses on the specific problems associated with protein identification of a species with a poorly characterized genome and discusses two complementary approaches. Proteins can be identified by comparing the proteins of interest to orthologous proteins of species that are well characterised. In one approach, peptide mass fingerprints (PMF) and peptide sequence information were combined to search and to correlate the un-interpreted spectra with the theoretical product ion spectra from different databases in an automated way. However, some orthologous genes retain a low percentage of identity and the chance of finding significant and conserved peptides decreases and a pmf-MS/MS approach might fail. A method that extracts protein-identifying information directly from spectra without being dependent on existing databases is extremely useful. However, deriving sequences from MS/MS spectra is not straightforward. MALDI TOF/TOF ion spectra contain in general incomplete ion series typically rich in various ion types. Attempts to simplify the de novo identification rely mainly on the simplification of the fragmentation pattern. The addition of a sulfonic acid group to the N-termini of tryptic peptides facilitates de novo peptide sequencing. The strong acidic group at the N-terminus is deprotonated and therefore neutralizes the positive charge of the b-ion by its negative charge. This results in simple spectra displaying mainly y-ions series. In this chapter, an innovative approach in which the extracted tryptic peptides are N-terminal sulfonated without any further sample purification is reported and successfully applied to banana. It was demonstrated that this approach results in a high and reliable identification rate and that it is adequate to identify different isoforms resulting from allelic variations, or from different gene loci. Now that the technical challenges (sample preparation and protein identification) are tackled, Chapter IV focusses back on the biological question, i. e the understanding of the mechanisms behind acclimation mediated by the sucrose pre-culture. Banana is an excellent model for the study of meristems thanks to the development of the shoot meristem tip culture technique. For the first time, a large scale study of a meristematic proteome is reported. The results suggest that the maintenance of an osmoprotective intracellular sucrose concentration, the enhanced expression of particular genes of the energy-conserving glycolysis and the conservation of the cell wall integrity are essential to maintain homeostasis, to acclimate and to survive dehydration. By comparing the dehydration tolerant variety (ABB) with a dehydration sensitive variety (AAAh), it was possible to distinguish several genotype specific proteins (isoforms) and to associate the dehydration tolerant variety with proteins involved in energy metabolism (e. g. phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglucomutase, UGPase) and proteins that are associated with stress adaptation (e. g. OSR 40 -like protein, ASR). This work proves that proteome analysis is successful to perform quantitative difference analysis and to characterize genetic variations in a recalcitrant crop. Chapter V examines the matter further to get a better insight into the acclimation process and to correlate acclimation with cryopreservation. Both, a dynamic study (screening over time) and a comparison between varieties are reported with the focus on the validation of candidate proteins. Although the sucrose pre-treatment and the concomitant high intracellular sucrose concentration are required for a low mortality rate after cryopreservation, it also induces negative stress effects. Sucrose pre-culture is correlated to high relative abundance of phosphoglycerate kinase, UGPase and OSR 40 and a low relative abundance of SuSy, lectin and chitinase and abscisic stress ripening protein-like protein (ASR). We hypothesise that a low mortality rate after cyopreservation can be achieved by a low relative abundance of SuSy and high relative abundance of phosphoglycerate kinase, OSR 40, UGPase, ASR and storage proteins such as lectin and chitinase. A screening of candidate proteins link several proteins and specific isoforms to the tolerant B genome, which opens perspectives to apply proteomics for taxonomical characterization and classification.

There are good assets to water on our Earth, but only a fraction of this water is of a quality good enough for it to be potable. As of today, more than 700 million people worldwide lack access to drinking water of good quality. Uganda is one out of many countries that are affected by this and many sources of drinking water in Uganda's urban environments also risk to be contaminated by metals such as lead and manganese. The country is undergoing a significant development, but the financial resources are limited. It is therefore important to try to solve the drinking water supply both quickly and economically advantageous. Uganda is a country that is rich in natural resources, {{and as a result of}} that, the feasibility of using biomass from the remains of some agricultural products for water purification water has begun to being examined. This study focuses on two of the biggest agricultural products in Uganda, Coffea canephora and <b>Musa</b> <b>spp,</b> which are sorts of coffee plant and banana plants. Biomasses from these products have previously been shown to be theoretically suitable for purifying water from metals. The purpose of this study is to determine the sorption capacity of lead for the biomasses of Coffea canephora and <b>Musa</b> <b>spp.</b> This new data and information can then help with the development of practical application of these biosorbents in drinking water treatment in Uganda. This has been carried out by laboration. In the lab, six different water samples were constructed, all with different compositions of the metals lead, manganese and calcium. The levels of manganese and calcium were varied to determine how their presence affected the sorption capacity of lead for both biomasses. The results showed that both Coffea canephora and <b>Musa</b> <b>spp</b> can purify water, with an initial lead concentration of 50 μg/L, so good that the lead concentration falls below the WHO’s threshold of 10 μg/L after the sorption process. This was true for all water samples, despite of difference in metal content. The Sorption capacity showed to be for <b>Musa</b> <b>spp</b> from 6. 64 μg/g to 7. 17 μg/g and for Coffea canephora from 5. 94 μg/g to 6. 40 μg/g. Biomass from <b>Musa</b> <b>spp</b> had better sorption capacity in comparison between the two biomasses, regardless of the different compositions of the water. However, the sorption capacity for <b>Musa</b> <b>spp</b> was reduced when there was manganese but no calcium in the water. The sorption capacity for Coffea canephora deteriorated when there were more metals than lead in the water. Apart from this, there was no clear correlation of how the concentration of manganese and calcium were related to the sorption capacity of lead. This study has been limited in terms of time and resources, therefore further studies will be needed to get a better overall understanding of how the use of biosorbents can contribute to drinking water of good quality. In spite of this, the results prove that both biomasses have a good sorption capacity of lead, which is a good basis for further studies towards a real implementation of biomass use in purification of drinking water in Uganda. ...|$|E

The present work analyzes {{the behavior of}} banana explants, cv. Nanicão (<b>Musa</b> <b>spp.</b> Group AAA) regarding somatic embryogenesis induction treatments with several auxins. Longitudinal segments of shoot meristematic apices of micropropagated banana plantlets cultivated and rooted in vitro were introduced in culture medium containing dicamba, picloram, 2, 4 -D or NAA in different concentrations. Explant samples were collected at 0, 7 and 10 days and prepared for light microscopy. Histological sections were used for comparison of the histological changes occurring after induction treatment with different auxins. Embryogenic response was observed only in treatments with picloram or dicamba, with distinct embryogenic regions observed at 14 and 21 days in culture, respectively. Histological sections of embryogenic regions of the explant at 26 days in culture revealed the formation of meristematic regions, structures with multiple root meristems, and somatic embryos at early globular stages. Embryo-like structures morphologically similar to Musa balbisiana zygotic embryos were sectioned and showed a lack of apical meristems and absence of procambial differentiation. These results indicate the induction of non-functional somatic embryos {{and the need for}} more studies on developmental aspects and maturation treatments for optimization of the process.

Plants in vitro selection offers advantages over field selection as it saves time, resources and permit to work with larger plant volumes. Before to establish an in vitro selection protocol for drought, it is necessary first, to establish some conditions. The aim of this work was to determine the minimum polyethylene glycol 6000 concentration which morpho-physiological variables are affected in in vitro <b>Musa</b> <b>spp.</b> plants, 'Grande naine' (AAA) and 'Pelipita' (ABB) cultivars. In vitro plants were subjected to four polyethylene glycol 6000 concentrations (3, 5, 7 and 9 %; w/v) in semisolid multiplication culture medium. Also it was taken into account a control treatment without polyethylene glycol 6000. As stress indicators, plant height, leaf area, fresh weight, dry weight and malondialdehyde content were evaluated. After 30 days of culture, all variables were significantly affected in 'Grande naine' cultivar from 3 % polyethylene glycol 6000, whereas in 'Pelipita' cultivar the affections began to be significative from 5 %.
