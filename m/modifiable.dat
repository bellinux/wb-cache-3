5|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} {{proposed}} relationships between certain <b>modifiable</b> factors, such as diet, cardiovascular risk, pharmaceutical products, or intellectual activities among others, and a population's likelihood of developing AD. Only further research, including clinical trials, will reveal whether these factors {{can help to}} prevent AD.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} MS is unknown; however, it is {{believed}} to occur {{as a result of}} some combination of genetic and environmental factors such as infectious agents. Theories try to combine the data into likely explanations, but none has proved definitive. While {{there are a number of}} environmental risk factors and although some are partly <b>modifiable,</b> further research is needed to determine whether their elimination can prevent MS.|$|E
5|$|All {{of these}} cerebellum-like {{structures}} {{appear to be}} primarily sensory-related rather than motor-related. All of them have granule cells {{that give rise to}} parallel fibers that connect to Purkinje-like neurons with <b>modifiable</b> synapses, but none have climbing fibers comparable to those of the cerebellumâ€”instead they receive direct input from peripheral sensory organs. None has a demonstrated function, but the most influential speculation is that they serve to transform sensory inputs in some sophisticated way, perhaps to compensate for changes in body posture. In fact, James M. Bower and others have argued, partly {{on the basis of these}} structures and partly on the basis of cerebellar studies, that the cerebellum itself is fundamentally a sensory structure, and that it contributes to motor control by moving the body in a way that controls the resulting sensory signals. Despite Bower's viewpoint, there is also strong evidence that the cerebellum directly influences motor output in mammals.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{factors for}} {{osteoporotic}} fracture can be split between nonmodifiable and (potentially) <b>modifiable.</b> In addition, osteoporosis is a recognized complication of specific diseases and disorders. Medication use is theoretically <b>modifiable,</b> although in many cases, {{the use of}} medication that increases osteoporosis risk may be unavoidable.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} <b>modifiable</b> {{risk factor for}} many men is smoking.|$|E
25|$|Cardiovascular {{risk factors}} {{are more than}} additive. (If high blood {{pressure}} is worth 10 and smoking is worth 10, together they are worth more than 20.) So for transgender men, the addition of risk with androgen therapy makes improving <b>modifiable</b> risk factors more important.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} <b>modifiable</b> {{risk factors for}} stroke are {{high blood pressure and}} atrial fibrillation although the size of the effect is small with 833 people have to be treated for 1 year to prevent one stroke. Other <b>modifiable</b> risk factors include high blood cholesterol levels, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking (active and passive), drinking lots of alcohol and drug use, lack of physical activity, obesity, processed red meat consumption and unhealthy diet. Alcohol use could predispose to ischemic stroke, and intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage via multiple mechanisms (for example via hypertension, atrial fibrillation, rebound thrombocytosis and platelet aggregation and clotting disturbances). Drugs, most commonly amphetamines and cocaine, can induce stroke through damage to the blood vessels in the brain and acute hypertension.|$|E
25|$|Lifestyle {{prevention}} of osteoporosis {{is in many}} aspects the inverse of the potentially <b>modifiable</b> risk factors. As tobacco smoking and high alcohol intake have been linked with osteoporosis, smoking cessation and moderation of alcohol intake are commonly recommended as ways to help prevent it.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the detection of abnormal BMD, the diagnosis of osteoporosis requires investigations into potentially <b>modifiable</b> underlying causes; this may be done with blood tests. Depending on the likelihood of an underlying problem, investigations for cancer with metastasis to the bone, multiple myeloma, Cushing's disease and other above-mentioned causes may be performed.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between {{type 2 diabetes}} and the main <b>modifiable</b> risk factors (excess weight, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and tobacco use) is similar in all regions of the world. There is growing evidence that the underlying determinants of diabetes are {{a reflection of the}} major forces driving social, economic and cultural change: globalization, urbanization, population aging, and the general health policy environment.|$|E
25|$|The Unix {{system is}} {{composed}} of several components that were originally packaged together. By including the development environment, libraries, documents and the portable, <b>modifiable</b> source code {{for all of these}} components, in addition to the kernel of an operating system, Unix was a self-contained software system. This was one of the key reasons it emerged as an important teaching and learning tool and has had such a broad influence.|$|E
25|$|Another {{business}} model {{is to give}} away the software in order to sell hardware. This {{used to be the}} norm in the computer industry, with operating systems such as CP/M, Apple DOS and versions of Mac OS prior to 7.6 freely copyable (but not <b>modifiable).</b> As computer hardware standardized throughout the 1980s, it became more difficult for hardware manufacturers to profit from this tactic, as the OS would run on any manufacturer's computer that shared the same architecture.|$|E
25|$|Public health {{professionals}} have also levelled criticism at the CAP and its support regimes, arguing that agricultural policy often disregards health. It {{is evident that}} supply outputs are generating widespread public health issues of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as cardio-vascular disease (CVD), cancer and type II diabetes. Diet {{is one of the}} major <b>modifiable</b> determinants in promoting or preventing chronic disease, and agricultural products have a major influence on the disease risk factors.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of blood clots can be interrupted and prevented {{by the use}} of medication, changing risk factors and other interventions. Some risk factors can be modified. These would be losing weight, increasing exercise and the cessation of oral contraceptives. Moving during periods of travel is a <b>modifiable</b> behavior. Preventing blood clots includes the use of medications that interrupt the complex clotting cascade and changing the proteins that are needed for clotting. Antiplatelet drugs also have an effect in preventing the formation of clots.|$|E
500|$|The {{inclusion}} of procedural content tools {{allowed for the}} creation of realistic environments at much faster rates than was the case with Morrowind. Using Interactive Data Visualization, Inc. (IDV)'s SpeedTree technology, for example, Bethesda artists were able to [...] "quickly generate complex and organic tree shapes with relative ease". With its [...] "parent/child hierarchies and iterative branch levels [...] highly <b>modifiable</b> cylinder primitives", Bethesda's Noah Berry attests that [...] "an entire tree shape can be created in a manner of minutes, just by adjusting numerical values and tweaking spline curve handles". Instead of Morrowinds artificially smoothed-over terrain, erosion algorithms incorporated in the landscape generation tools allowed {{for the creation of}} [...] "craggy mountain vistas" [...] quickly and easily.|$|E
500|$|In general, Naija cannot {{interact}} {{directly with}} {{objects in the}} world. Instead, the majority of actions are accomplished through singing short tunes. The player does this by selecting a series of notes displayed in a circle of eight choices in the correct order. Each note corresponds with a different color. Singing notes affects plants and objects of {{the same color as}} the note, while singing the tunes, once learned through the plot, can lift objects, create a shield around Naija, or change Naija into different [...] "forms" [...] which have different appearances and unique abilities critical to overcoming the various challenges and obstacles found in the game. The specific tones that are played when the player selects a note can subtly change in different regions, matching the background music. The default form, or [...] "normal form", is the only one in which Naija can sing, and is the only one where her appearance is <b>modifiable</b> by the player by having Naija wear costumes found throughout the game.|$|E
500|$|To {{encourage}} exploration, the Magnum Opus can be upgraded {{with materials}} scavenged from the desert, by hijacking enemies' cars or collecting their car parts. An enemy can jump {{on top of}} the Magnum Opus to make it explode, but the player can avoid that by surrounding the car with hazards such as spikes. The player can access the garage screen throughout the game, allowing them to customize the Magnum Opus. Max's garage can change and modify the car's engine, chassis, wheels, body work, paint job, and its [...] "shell". Upgrading one aspect of the car will negatively affect other aspects; upgrading the engine will allow Max to drive faster, but handling will be more difficult. The sound produced by the engine changes when players change, add, or remove parts of the Magnum Opus. Max, his armor, and weapons are customizable; the player can unlock new skills and upgrades for him as he progresses through the game and earns experience points. Max is also customizable, with his clothing, appearance, fighting skills, and weapons being <b>modifiable.</b> Griffa, a wasteland wanderer, also offers Max tokens which can be used to upgrade his abilities.|$|E
500|$|After the game's release, id Software {{licensed}} {{the engine}} to other developers, like the Commander Keen engine before it, {{as part of a}} series of engine licensing deals that id has made throughout its history; games using the Wolfenstein 3D engine or derivatives of it include , the Capstone Software games [...] and Operation Body Count, as well as Super 3D Noah's Ark. Apogee intended to produce an expansion pack in 1993 titled Rise of the Triad: Wolfenstein 3D Part II, designed by Tom Hall using the Wolfenstein 3D engine, but during development the game was changed into a stand-alone title with an enhanced engine, Rise of the Triad. Additionally, Softdisk produced Catacomb Abyss using the prototype Wolfenstein 3D engine from Catacomb 3-D as part of the Catacomb Adventure Series trilogy of sequels. Although Wolfenstein 3D was not designed to be editable or modified, players developed character and level editors to create original alterations to the game's content. John Carmack and Romero, who had played numerous mods of other games, were delighted, and overrode any concerns about copyright issues by the others. The modding efforts of Wolfenstein players led id Software to explicitly design later titles like Doom and Quake to be easily <b>modifiable</b> by players, even including the map editing tools id Software used with the games. The source code for the original Wolfenstein 3D engine was released by id in 1995; when making the 2009 iOS port, Carmack used some of the enhancements to the engine made by fans after its release. The game's technical achievements also led to numerous imitators such as Ken's Labyrinth, Nitemare 3D, , Terminal Terror and The Fortress of Dr. Radiaki, among others.|$|E

2500|$|An {{example of}} a {{primitive}} recursive programming language is one that contains basic arithmetic operators (e.g. + and âˆ’, or ADD and SUBTRACT), conditionals and comparison (IF-THEN, EQUALS, LESS-THAN), and bounded loops, such as the basic for loop, {{where there is a}} known or calculable upper bound to all loops (FOR i FROM 1 to n, with neither i nor n <b>modifiable</b> by the loop body). No control structures of greater generality, such as while loops or IF-THEN plus GOTO, are admitted in a primitive recursive language. Douglas Hofstadter's BlooP in GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach is one such. [...] Adding unbounded loops (WHILE, GOTO) makes the language partially recursive, or Turing-complete; Floop is such, as are almost all real-world computer languages.|$|E
2500|$|An {{emphasis}} on educating women about lifestyle changes {{that may have}} a small impact on preventing breast cancer often makes women feel guilty if they do develop breast cancer. Some women decide that their own cancer resulted from poor diet, lack of exercise, or other <b>modifiable</b> lifestyle factor, even though most cases of breast cancer are due to non-controllable factors, like genetics or naturally occurring background radiation. Adopting such a belief may increase their sense of being {{in control of their}} fate. Increased awareness inadvertently increases victim blaming. [...] Women who resist screening mammography or breast self-exams are subjected to social pressure, scare tactics, guilt, and threats from some physicians to terminate the relationship with the patient. Similarly, the {{emphasis on}} early detection results in many women wrongly blaming themselves if their cancer is not detected at an early stage.|$|E
2500|$|The Seven Countries Study was {{formally}} started in fall 1958 in Yugoslavia. In total, 12,763 males, 40â€“59 years of age, {{were enrolled in}} seven countries, in four {{regions of the world}} (United States, Northern Europe, Southern Europe, Japan). One cohort is in the United States, two cohorts in Finland, one in the Netherlands, three in Italy, five in Yugoslavia (two in Croatia, and three in Serbia), two in Greece, and two in Japan. The entry examinations were performed between 1958 and 1964 with an average participation rate of 90%, lowest in the USA, with 75% and highest in one of the Japanese cohorts, with 100%. Keys' book Eat Well and Stay Well popularized the supplementary idea that reducing the amount of saturated fat in the diet would reduce cholesterol levels and the risks of serious diseases due to atheroma. Keys was followed {{during the rest of the}} 20th century by an accumulation of work that repeatedly demonstrated associations between cholesterol levels (and other <b>modifiable</b> risk factors including smoking and exercise) and risks of heart disease. These led to the acceptance of the lipid hypothesis as orthodoxy by much of the medical community; ...|$|E
2500|$|With the {{emergence}} of cardiovascular disease as {{a major cause of}} death in the Western world {{in the middle of the}} 20th century, the lipid hypothesis received greater attention. In the 1940s, a University of Minnesota researcher, Ancel Keys, postulated that the apparent epidemic of heart attacks in middle-aged American men was related to their mode of life and possibly <b>modifiable</b> physical characteristics. He first explored this idea in a group of Minnesota business and professional men that he recruited into a prospective study in 1947, the first of many cohort studies eventually mounted internationally. The men were followed through 1981 and the first major report appeared in 1963. After fifteen years follow-up, the study confirmed the results of larger studies that reported earlier on the predictive value for heart attack of several risk factors, blood pressure, blood cholesterol level, and cigarette smoking. Meanwhile, in the mid-1950s, with improved methods and design, Keys recruited collaborating researchers in seven countries to mount the first cross-cultural comparison of heart attack risk in populations of men engaged in traditional occupations in cultures contrasting in diet, especially in the proportion of fat calories of different composition, the Seven Countries Study still under observation today. Even before the study had begun, there had been criticism of its methods. Yerushalmy and Hilleboe pointed out that Keys had selected for the study the countries that would give him the results he wanted, while leaving out data from sixteen countries that would not. They also pointed out that Keys was studying a [...] "tenuous association" [...] rather than any possible proof of causation.|$|E

Without doubt a materialized negro could easily be hypnotized into a state {{resembling}} silence. And this could be made permanent--yes, and also <b>modifiable,</b> at will--sometimes very silent, sometimes turn on more talk, more action, more emotion, according to what you want. It's a prime good idea. Make it adjustable--with a screw or something." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{while he}} {{rejected}} pure necessitarianism in its crude form as essentially a REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM of life, he was fully {{conscious of the}} fact that the will is not a mysterious and ultimate unit of force beyond which we cannot go and whose special characteristic is inconsistency, but a certain creative attitude of the mind which is, from the first, continually influenced by habits, education and circumstance; so absolutely <b>modifiable,</b> in a word, that the good and the bad man alike seem to lose the power of free will; for the one is morally unable to sin, the other physically incapacitated for reformation.|$|E
60|$|At {{the point}} {{which we have}} now reached, {{it can not be}} {{necessary}} to say any thing either in proof or in illustration of the assertion that such is not the true character of the social phenomena. There is not, among these most complex and (for that reason) most <b>modifiable</b> of all phenomena, any one over which innumerable forces do not exercise influence; which does not depend on a conjunction of very many causes. We have not, therefore, to prove the notion in question to be an error, but to prove that the error has been committed; that so mistaken a conception of the mode in which the phenomena of society are produced has actually been ascertained.|$|E
60|$|As {{the family}} comes before the State {{in order of}} time--as the {{bringing}} up of children is possible before the State exists, or when it has ceased to be, whereas the State is rendered possible only by the bringing up of children; {{it follows that the}} duties of the parent demand closer attention than those of the citizen. Or, to use a further argument--since the goodness of a society ultimately depends on the nature of its citizens; and since the nature of its citizens is more <b>modifiable</b> by early training than by anything else; we must conclude that the welfare of the family underlies the welfare of society. And hence knowledge directly conducing to the first, must take precedence of knowledge directly conducing to the last.|$|E

Is it true always, as {{it appears to be}} generally true, that women are less <b>modifiable</b> than men? The relative conservatism of women--their greater adhesion to established ideas and practices--is manifest in many civilized and semi-civilized societies. Is it so among the uncivilized? A curious instance of stronger attachment to custom in women than in men is given by Dalton, as occurring among the Juangs, one of the lowest wild tribes of Bengal. Until recently the only dress of both sexes was something less than that which the Hebrew legend gives to Adam and Eve. Years ago the men were led to adopt a cloth bandage round the loins, in place of the bunch of leaves; but the women adhered to the aboriginal habit: a conservatism shown where it might have been least expected.|$|E
