5|$|The YF-23 was an unconventional-looking aircraft, with {{diamond-shaped}} wings, {{a profile}} with substantial area-ruling to reduce aerodynamic drag at transonic speeds, and an all-moving V-tail. The cockpit was placed high, near {{the nose of}} the aircraft for good visibility for the pilot. The aircraft featured a tricycle landing gear configuration with a nose landing gear leg and two <b>main</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> legs. The weapons bay was placed {{on the underside of the}} fuselage between the nose and <b>main</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> The cockpit has a center stick and side throttle.|$|E

50|$|The Me 609 {{would have}} joined the two Me 309 fuselages with a new centre wing section. Only the two inner wheels of the joined Me 309's <b>main</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> would have been used and would retract into the centre section. This {{resulted}} in an unusual four-wheel arrangement. The pilot would have sat in a cockpit located in the port fuselage, with the starboard being smoothed over.|$|R

5|$|The A320 {{airframe}} includes {{composite materials}} and aluminium alloys to save weight {{and reduce the}} total number of parts to decrease the maintenance costs. Its tail assembly is made almost entirely of such composites by CASA, who also builds the elevators, <b>main</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> doors, and rear fuselage parts.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{changes of}} the -200 over the -100 are wingtip fences and {{increased}} fuel capacity for increased range. Indian Airlines used its first 31 A320-200s with double-bogie <b>main</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> for airfields with poor runway condition which a single-bogie main gear could not manage.|$|E

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{features a}} cantilever mid-wing, a single-seat enclosed cockpit under a bubble canopy, fixed <b>main</b> tricycle <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> with a retractable nose wheel, a t-tail, nose mounted canard {{and a single}} engine in pusher configuration.|$|R
25|$|The Twin Bonanza is an {{all-metal}} low-wing cantilever cabin monoplane initially {{powered by}} two wing-mounted Lycoming GO-435 piston engines {{each with a}} wooden two-bladed propeller. The cabin has room for six people on bench seats, three {{in the front and}} three in the rear accessed by a side door on the right side. To gain access to the door a retractable three-tread steps is used. The Twin Bonanza has a tricycle <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> with the nose wheel retracting rearwards and the <b>main</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> retracting partially into the engine nacelles, this leaves the tire exposed to assist {{in the event of a}} wheels-up landing.|$|R
5|$|The <b>main</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> {{touched down}} at 12:01:27pmEST (17:01:27UTC) on 20 November, a mission elapsed time (MET) of 8days 4hours 30minutes and 44seconds. Nose gear touched down at 8days 4hours 30minutes 54seconds (12:01:37pmEST – 17:01:37UTC) and Atlantiss wheels stopped at an MET of 8days 4hours 31minutes 42seconds (12:02:24pmEST – 17:02:24UTC), {{bringing}} the 73rd space shuttle mission to a close.|$|E
5|$|On 15 September 2005, B-1B (s/n 85-0066) was {{extensively}} {{damaged by}} fire while landing at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. The {{investigation into the}} incident concluded that leaking hydraulic fluid and sparks from a wheel being gouged caused a fire to start in the aircraft's right <b>main</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> as it touched down. The resulting fire damaged the B-1's right wing, engine nacelle, airframe and landing gear, leading to an estimated repair cost of more than $32million.|$|E
5|$|On 8 May 1975, while {{practicing}} a 9-g aerial display maneuver {{with the}} second YF-16 (tail number 72-1568) at Fort Worth, Texas, prior to {{being sent to the}} Paris Air Show, one of the <b>main</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> jammed. The test pilot, Neil Anderson, had to perform an emergency gear-up landing and chose {{to do so in the}} grass, hoping to minimize damage and to avoid injuring any observers. The aircraft was only slightly damaged, but due to the mishap the first prototype was sent to the Paris Air Show in its place.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>main</b> single-wheel <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> is sprung with an oleo-pneumatic shock absorber. When retracted, {{it still}} {{protrudes}} enough outside {{so there is}} little or no damage even if the wheel is accidentally left in the raised position for landing.|$|R
5|$|The 747 has {{redundant}} structures {{along with}} four redundant hydraulic systems and four <b>main</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> with four wheels each, which {{provide a good}} spread of support {{on the ground and}} safety in case of tire blow-outs. The main gear are redundant so that landing can be performed on two opposing <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> if the others do not function properly. In addition, the 747 has split control surfaces and was designed with sophisticated triple-slotted flaps that minimize landing speeds and allow the 747 to use standard-length runways. For transportation of spare engines, 747s can accommodate a non-functioning fifth-pod engine under the port wing of the aircraft between the inner functioning engine and the fuselage.|$|R
40|$|Airframe noise {{has been}} {{measured}} on a. 015 scale model of an advanced supersonic transport concept (AST- 100) in an anechoic flow facility. The model {{was equipped with}} leading- and trailing-edge flaps, nose and <b>main</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gears,</b> and engine nacelles. Each of these components was deployed, individually and collectively, to determine their contribution to the noise field. Results are presented which show that in the clean configuration the aircraft displays a symmetric dipole directivity, whereas in the more complex landing-approach configuration the directivity peaks in the forward quadrant. It {{was found that the}} landing-approach noise was due chiefly to the <b>landing</b> <b>gear,</b> the trailing edge flaps, and the aeroacoustic interaction between the tw...|$|R
5|$|The front {{landing gear}} is offset to the aircraft's right to allow {{placement}} of the 30mm cannon with its firing barrel along the centerline of the aircraft. During ground taxi, the offset front landing gear causes the A-10 to have dissimilar turning radii. Turning to the right on the ground takes less distance than turning left. The wheels of the <b>main</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> partially protrude from their nacelles when retracted, making gear-up belly landings easier to control and less damaging. All landing gears are hinged toward the aircraft's rear; if hydraulic power is lost, a combination of gravity and aerodynamic drag can open and lock the gear in place.|$|E
5|$|The {{prototype}} was registered G-ALVG {{just before}} it was publicly displayed at the 1949 Farnborough Airshow {{prior to the start}} of flight trials. A year later, the second prototype G-5-2 made its maiden flight. The second prototype was registered G-ALZK in July 1950 and it was used by the BOAC Comet Unit at Hurn from April 1951 to carry out 500 flying hours of crew training and route proving. Australian airline Qantas also sent its own technical experts to observe the performance of the prototypes, seeking to quell internal uncertainty about its prospective Comet purchase. Both prototypes could be externally distinguished from later Comets by the large single-wheeled <b>main</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear,</b> which was replaced on production models starting with G-ALYP by four-wheeled bogies.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} {{designed}} {{with a new}} methodology called fault tree analysis, which allowed {{the effects of a}} failure of a single part to be studied to determine its impact on other systems. To address concerns about safety and flyability, the 747's design included structural redundancy, redundant hydraulic systems, quadruple <b>main</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> and dual control surfaces. Additionally, some of the most advanced high-lift devices used in the industry were included in the new design, to allow it to operate from existing airports. These included slats running almost {{the entire length of the}} wing, as well as complex three-part slotted flaps along the trailing edge of the wing. The wing's complex three-part flaps increase wing area by 21 percent and lift by 90 percent when fully deployed compared to their non-deployed configuration.|$|E

50|$|The Boeing 757 {{left the}} runway at high speed, {{approximately}} 1000 m {{from the second}} touchdown point. It then ran 343 m across flat grassland beside the runway, before going diagonally over a substantial earth mound adjacent to the airport boundary, becoming semi-airborne as a result. Beyond the mound it hit a number of medium-sized trees and the right engine struck the boundary fence. The aircraft then passed through the fence, re-landed in a field and both <b>main</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> collapsed. It finally stopped after a 244 m slide across the field, 1900 m from the second touchdown.|$|R
5|$|By late Friday night, {{they had}} laid {{out what was}} {{essentially}} a new airplane. The new design (464-49) built upon the basic layout of the B-47 Stratojet with 35 degree swept wings, eight engines paired in four underwing pods, and bicycle landing gear with wingtip outrigger wheels. A notable feature of the landing gear was the ability to pivot the <b>main</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> up to 20° from the aircraft centerline to increase safety during crosswind landings. After {{a trip to a}} hobby shop for supplies, Schairer set to work building a model. The rest of the team focused on weight and performance data. Wells, who was also a skilled artist, completed the aircraft drawings. On Sunday, a stenographer was hired to type a clean copy of the proposal. On Monday, Schairer presented Colonel Warden with a neatly bound 33-page proposal and a 14-inch scale model. The aircraft was projected to exceed all design specifications.|$|E
5|$|On 26 October 1959, Vulcan B.1 XH498 {{participated in}} an airshow marking the opening of Wellington International Airport, {{formerly}} Rongotai Airport. After a ' touch-and-go landing' on Runway 34, it came around for a full stop landing. Turbulence and wind shear caused XH498 to land short of the runway threshold, the port undercarriage leg clipped the embankment at the Moa Point or southern end, damaging wing attachments, engine fuel lines and the <b>main</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> drag link, which was ruptured and unable to support the aircraft. The port wing tip nearly scraped the runway surface before {{it was able to}} lift off again, spilling fuel over the crowd. Pilot actions prevented a possible disaster as spectators were present on the western apron. XH498 flew to RNZAF Ohakea for a safe emergency landing on just the nose and starboard landing gear with little further damage. A UK repair team returned it to airworthiness; on 4 January 1960, XH498 departed, remaining in service until 19 October 1967.|$|E
5|$|The {{airframe}} {{incorporates the}} use of composite materials, which comprise nine percent of its original structural weight (all models outside the 777-8 and 777-9). Elements made from composite material include the cabin floor and rudder. The main fuselage cross-section is circular and tapers rearward into a blade-shaped tail cone with a port-facing auxiliary power unit. The aircraft also features the largest landing gear and the biggest tires ever used in a commercial jetliner. The six-wheel bogies are designed to spread the load of the aircraft over a wide area without requiring an additional centerline gear. This helps reduce weight and simplifies the aircraft's braking and hydraulic systems. Each tire of a 777-300ER six-wheel <b>main</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> can carry a load of , which is heavier than other wide-bodies such as the 747-400. The aircraft has triple redundant hydraulic systems with only one system required for landing. A ram air turbine –a small retractable propeller which can provide emergency power– is also fitted in the wing root fairing.|$|E
5000|$|One {{very early}} {{undercarriage}} arrangement that passively allowed for castoring during crosswind landings, unlike the [...] "active" [...] arrangement on the B-52, was pioneered on the Bleriot VIII design of 1908. It was later {{used in the}} much more famous Blériot XI Channel-crossing aircraft of 1909 and also copied in the earliest examples of the Etrich Taube. In this arrangement the <b>main</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear's</b> shock absorption was taken up by a vertically sliding bungee cord-sprung upper member. The vertical post along which the upper member slid to take landing shocks also had its lower end as the rotation point for the forward end of the main wheel's suspension fork, allowing the main gear to pivot on moderate crosswind landings.|$|R
40|$|In the {{approach}} phase of large commercial aircraft, airframe noise - {{and in particular}} that from <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> - {{is one of the}} dominant aircraft noise components. Within a European co-financed research project entitled "Significantly Lower Community Exposure to Aircraft Noise" (codenamed SILENCER) a study in "advanced low noise <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> design" was performed to develop operational <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> which take into account aeroacoustic constraints early in the design stage. Airbus aircraft typical configurations of low wing with underslung engines and A 340 type gears were selected as reference. RANS flow field calculations were performed and used to identify and thus avoid the impingement of high speed flow onto critical gear structure elements. The evaluation of CFD results with respect to the effects on aerodynamic noise was performed on the basis of related experimental experience and a semi-empirical <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> noise model. Both low noise advanced nose and <b>main</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> were designed and manufactured at full scale for noise testing in the 8 m by 6 m open test section of the German-Dutch Wind Tunnel (DNW-LLF). Relative to the conventional reference gears a reduction of broadband <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> noise in the order of 5 to 6 dB (i. e. on source level) was achieved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{fatigue test}} of a {{full-scale}} aircraft body aims to understand the initiation and development of fatigue damage and fatigue crack of its critical structures, and hence to determine fatigue life, maintenance and repairing cycles. The work of non-destructive testing and acoustic emission (AE) monitoring during the whole fatigue test {{plays a key role}} in guaranteeing the success of the test and achieving the prescribed goal. The controlling test of <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> is part of this fatigue test. The main structures under considerations are uplocks and lower locks of <b>main</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gears,</b> uplock of nose <b>landing</b> <b>gear,</b> and actuator cylinder flanges of both gears. By using the combination of trend analysis and correlation analysis of AE parameters, real time monitoring of <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> condition is realized, and the leak in the actuator and the linkage wearing were successfully predicted. The methods used are straightforward and direct, they can supply fast analysis speed and realize real time monitoring. The work provides a useful reference for AE signal processing in the future fatigue test or for AE monitoring technique used in the same environment of high background noise...|$|R

25|$|The <b>main</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear,</b> {{housed in}} the {{nacelles}} behind the engines, were raised and lowered hydraulically. The <b>main</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> shock absorbers were de Havilland manufactured and used a system of rubber in compression, rather than hydraulic oleos, with twin pneumatic brakes for each wheel. The Dunlop-Marstrand anti-shimmy tailwheel was also retractable.|$|E
25|$|March 25, 2016: Flight 29 {{en route}} from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport to Nassau, Bahamas {{performed}} an emergency landing at Lynden Pindling International Airport after reporting a <b>main</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> failure prior to arrival.

40|$|Future <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> designs must {{account for}} {{aeroacoustics}} requirements at design stage. The development of such advanced low noise <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> for future aircraft application {{was performed in}} Silencer WP 1. 5. 4, taking production costs, maintenance aspects and acoustic benefits into account. In SILENCER WP 2. 3. 3 full scale low noise gear mock ups were built and noise tested in the DNW-LLF. The noise test results were compared against those obtained for the baseline A 340 <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> in the RAIN project. For both the nose and the <b>main</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> each one reference configuration (as designed in WP 1. 5. 4) and selected configuration modifications were tested. Farfield noise spectra turned out to scale on a Strouhal number basis, with sound intensities increasing with wind speed {{to the power of}} 6. In terms of overall A-weighted noise levels the advanced low noise NLG is up to - 7 dB quieter compared to the A 340 baseline gear for forward arc radiation directions. The advanced low noise MLG is up to about - 5 dB quieter compared to the A 340 baseline gear...|$|R
5000|$|On 14 September 1999, at 21:47 UTC, a Boeing 757-204 {{charter flight}} from Cardiff, Wales, UK, with 236 {{passengers}} and 9 crew left the runway when landing {{in a storm}} and broke apart. After leaving the runway, it ran 343 metres across flat grassland beside the runway, before going diagonally over a substantial earth mound adjacent to the airport boundary, becoming semi-airborne as a result. Beyond the mound it hit and severed a number of medium-sized trees and the right engine struck the boundary fence. The aircraft then yawed considerably to the right, passed through the fence, landed again in a field, and its <b>main</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> collapsed. It finally stopped after a 244-metre slide across the field. Damage was substantial: the fuselage was broken in two places and the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> and both engines detached. Remarkably, there were no immediate fatalities but 44 people, including the aircraft's captain, received hospital treatment for severe to minor injuries.|$|R
50|$|In {{an attempt}} to revive the project, {{initiated}} {{in response to a}} 1941 Reich Air Ministry requirement for a new Zerstörer (destroyer) to replace the Bf 110, Messerschmitt's response was the Me 609. In order to meet the requirement of a new design in a minimum of time and with a minimum of new parts, the failed Me 309 project would form the basis of the new fighter. The Me 609 would have joined the two Me 309 fuselages with a new centre wing section. Only the two inner wheels of the joined Me 309's <b>main</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> would have been used and would retract into the centre section. This resulted in an unusual four-wheel arrangement. The Me 609 would have had its cockpit in the port fuselage, the starboard being smoothed over.|$|R
