It is a pleasure to me to express my best thanks to the directors of the Institutes mentioned above, for putting the material at my disposal, and to Miss <b>Dr</b> <b>J.</b> <b>Th.</b> Koster, who gave me much valuable help. Especially the material of the National Herbarium at Leiden was very interesting to me, since it contains the herbaria of Kützing, Hauck, and very many reliable exsiccata, so it was possible to compare some Dutch species with the original specimens...|$|R
40|$|As {{my friend}} <b>Dr</b> <b>J.</b> <b>Th.</b> Henrard, when young, paid much {{attention}} to the adventitious species of Fumaria, I will give here an enumeration of the species found in our country. This genus has been somewhat neglected with us, mainly owing {{to the fact that the}} descriptions in our flora’s are not exact, so that the determination was not always easy; the less so as the species are variable in several characters. As I have not much space at my disposal, I will refrain from giving detailed descriptions, but the essential characters I will lay down into the key, so that a correct determination is possible. Minute descriptions are to be found in the splendid works of Mr H. W. Pugsley, which have been a great help to me...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{notes are}} mainly {{based upon a}} small but interesting collection of plants, made in 1937 — 1939 by Mr C. Monod de Froideville, Civil Service Officer in the Netherlands Indies, during his extensive trips in the southern and central parts of the island of Celebes. His hobby was the study of Leguminosae and about half of his collection consists of representatives of that natural order. For several reasons, however, they have {{been left out of}} the present paper, for one thing since Mr Monod is intending to deal with them later on himself, a task, which circumstances unfortunately prevent him from accomplishing at present; and secondly since they promise geographically less important results than most other families, many of them being anthropochorous. However, beside Leguminosae, Mr Monod collected a good many other plants and though some of his material was necessarily scanty on account {{of the fact that the}} proper purpose of his trips lay outside purely botanical observations, it contains enough remarkable specimens, especially from the practically unknown interior of Central Celebes (Mt. Mamboeliling), to justify a record of them. Mr Monod has proved to be a keen observer and a thorough amateur botanist and geologist. Several of the specimens had been provisorily checked by Dr C. G. G. J. van Steenis, Buitenzorg, which was a great help in their final identification. Regarding this, it was my good fortune to win the help of several specialists in identifying specimens belonging to families falling within the scope of their special study. Thus I am indebted to the following investigators for their kind collaboration: Miss Dr G. J. H. Amshoff (Utrecht) : Urticaceae. Dr R. C. Bakhuizen van den Brink (Leiden) : Melastomataceae. Dr C. E. B. Bremekamp (Bilthoven) : Acanthaceae, Rubiaceae. <b>Dr</b> <b>J.</b> <b>Th.</b> Henrard (Leiden) : Graminead. Dr F. P. Jonker (Utrecht) : Burmanniaceae.

In {{accordance}} with the legal prescriptions he is due to take leave officially as keeper of the ”Rijksherbarium“. The present director, Prof. Dr H. J. Lam, invited me to write a short biography of Dr Henrard on this occasion. Having been Henrard’s eldest colleague till 1934 at the institution, I accepted willingly. Jan Theodoor Henrard was born October 16 th, 1881 at Maastricht, where his father, J. B. Henrard, {{was director of the}} Weight and Measures Office. There is a legend in the family that the Henrards originated from the Vendée (in France) as descendants of a Huguenot-refugee. Owing to this duties J. B. Henrard was often transferred with his family from one locality to the other; his children got their education in different towns of the country. Jan visited the elementary school at Maastricht. The secundary school he followed at Zwolle and Leeuwarden respectively. At Zwolle he made the acquaintance of two well-known Dutch florists, Lako, a teacher at the secundary school and Carmiggelt, an official at his fathers office. From them Jan gathered already an extensive knowledge of the Dutch flora. His final high school certificate he got at Sneek on August 10 th, 1901 (Diploma H. B. S.) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} notes {{refer to}} the typification of the two oldest species names applied in the genus Gelidium, including also comments on other related topics. Gelidium {{is probably the most}} confused genus, both nomenclaturally and taxonomically, of the Rhodophyta. This investigation began in an attempt to determine the correct names to be applied to the British species of the genus, but it was soon discovered that a much wider geographical consideration was necessary. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the help and assistance which has been afforded by <b>Dr.</b> <b>J.</b> <b>Th.</b> Koster in this and other investigations, over a period of many years. Extreme ecological and seasonal polymorphism are the principal causes of the present situation in the genus Gelidium. Extensive fieldwork over the past seventeen years has given some indication of the limits of taxa (Dixon, 1958, 1966), in so far as the European representatives are concerned. The nomenclatural problems are, however, still largely untouched. The purpose of the present paper is to examine critically the typification of the two oldest epithets referred to the genus Gelidium. These are: 1. cartilagineum, based on Fucus cartilagineus Linnaeus (1753), 2. corneum, based on Fucus corneus Hudson (1762) ...|$|R
