5000|$|Preplant: Preplant {{herbicides}} are nonselective herbicides {{applied to}} soil before planting. Some preplant herbicides may be mechanically {{incorporated into the}} soil. The objective for incorporation is to prevent dissipation through photodecomposition and/or volatility. The herbicides kill weeds as they grow through the herbicide treated zone. Volatile herbicides have to {{be incorporated into the}} soil before planting the pasture. Agricultural crops grown in soil treated with a preplant herbicide include tomatoes, corn, soybeans and strawberries. Soil fumigants like <b>metam-sodium</b> and dazomet are in use as preplant herbicides.|$|E

40|$|The use of <b>metam-sodium</b> as soil {{fumigant}} before planting strawberry tends {{to become a}} common practice in Europe since the product {{has proven to be}} a viable alternative to methyl bromide (Fritsch, 1998). Chemical disinfection is often a necessary step before planting strawberry as this intensive crop suffers a lack of rotation that exposes the plants to damaging soil borne pathogens (Phytophtora cactorum, P. fragariae, Verticillium dalhiae, Colletotrichum acutatum) and nematodes (Pratylenchus penetrans, P. crenatus, Meloïdogyne hapla, Xiphinema) (Girault, 1992). In this purpose, <b>metam-sodium</b> is used in Spain for the production of strawberry and in France for the disinfection of nurseries for strawberry plants. To express its biocidal properties, <b>metam-sodium</b> requires a proper technique of application that aims to compensate the limited diffusion of the fumigant in the soil. Our previous work found that a high level of efficacy, comparable with those of methyl bromide, is achieved when <b>metam-sodium</b> is applied through the drip-irrigation system or direct injection within the soil followed by mixin...|$|E
40|$|In 1986, <b>metam-sodium</b> {{broadcast}} at 152, 76, 38, 19, and 9. 5 kg a. i. /ha {{suppressed the}} population density of 19, 600 Pratylenchus penetrans/kg soil at planting by 100, 90, 63, 23, and 14 %, respectively, and in 1987, with 1, 370 P. penetrans/kg soil, by 99, 88, 57, 11, and 1 %. At harvest, soil population densities increased 2. 2 -fold in 1986 and 13. 9 -fold in 1987. Rate of population increase was similar at all rates of nematicide {{except it was}} slower at 152 kg a. i. /ha in 1987. In both years, shoot and root weights did not differ (P = 0. 05). In 1986 the number of tubers in plots treated with 76 and 152 kg <b>metam-sodium</b> a. i. /ha and the marketable tuber weight at the three highest rates {{did not differ significantly}} from the untreated control. However, 76 and 152 kg a. i. /ha resulted in larger numbers of tubers relative to the three lowest rates of <b>metam-sodium</b> and in higher tuber weight relative to the two lowest rates. Yield differences were not statistically significant in 1987, probably because of low infestation levels...|$|E
40|$|Three {{fields of}} marine clay soil were {{fumigated}} with 150 l/ha 1, 3 -dichloropropene (DD) (Telone II(TM), Shell 95 (TM)). On three dates after application, concentrations of Z- and E- 1, 3 -dichloropropene were measured per 5 cm layer of soil {{to a depth}} of 40 cm and integrals of concentration time products were calculated. When the fumigant was no longer detectable, a top soil treatment with either 150 l/ha <b>metam-sodium</b> or 180 kg/ha dazomet (active compound methyl isothiocyanate) was applied, followed immediately by autumn ploughing. Soil samples were taken before and after fumigation and after the top soil treatment to extract potato cyst nematodes (PCN). Survival was determined from hatching tests. Mortality after the DD treatment, defined as the complement of the percentage of survival, was estimated for each 5 cm layer of soil {{to a depth of}} 30 cm to construct dosage response curves. Fumigation with DD killed 48, 48, and 72 % of the PCN per field, respectively. Accelerated breakdown of DD by micro-organisms accounted for the two lower mortality rates. The additional top soil treatment with <b>metam-sodium</b> increased mortality to 90 % or more. Dazomet, however, was less effective (53 and 80 %) considering that twice as much of the active compound was applied as in the <b>metam-sodium</b> treatment. Multiplication, in pot experiments, of hatched juveniles originating from the injection layer after the DD treatment was 25 % less than that of those from untreated plots. This was caused by a lower fraction of juveniles developing into cysts. PCN could be retrieved from soil layers as deep as 80 cm below the surface. Fumigation reached {{only a fraction of the}} infested soil, down to 25 - 30 cm. The infestation foci were so small compared to the standard minimum area fumigated (1 ha) that 90 % of the active compound would be wasted on non-infested soil. Soil fumigation, whether or not combined with an additional top soil treatment, will seldom be profitable. Monitoring for infestation loci is recommended...|$|E

The top-six pesticides applied by U.S. farmers and ranchers in 1995 included two herbicides mostly used on corn (# 1 atrazine, and # 2 metolachlor), three soil fumigants primarily applied on fruit and vegetable crops (# 3 - 5, <b>metam-sodium,</b> methyl-bromide, dichloropropene), and one broad-leaf herbicide relied on in multiple cropping systems (# 6, 2, 4 -D).|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{efficacy}} of solarization (S), dazomet (D) and <b>metam-sodium</b> (MS) treatments on some weed species and their potential as alternative to methyl bromide (MB) was investigated in strawberry growing areas in Aydin province of Turkey. Efficacies of treatments were variable for weed species. Total five weed species, namely common purslane, annual bluegrass, common chamomille, horseweed and shepherd`s purse were considered in this study. Highest efficacy on weeds was provided by MB application, but S is a safe alternative to MB under suitable climatic conditions, because its application is economic and safer to environment and user.

40|$|Colombia flower exports were {{valued at}} about US$ 650 million in 2001 which made Colombia the world’s second largest exporter. Growers {{initially}} considered methyl bromide (MB) {{as an option}} but soon abandoned its use because MB was too difficult and dangerous to apply, too costly and the soils rich in organic matter fixed bromine causing plant phytotoxicity.

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarIn 1989 several {{groundwater}} wells below agricultural land, {{used for}} potato-, maize- and flowerbulb culture, {{as well as}} uncropped land has been sampled and analysed for pesticides. Below vulnerable soil types as well as less vulnerable soil types which are representative for an average Dutch sandy soil several pesticide residues have been found. Since {{the start of this}} sampling program in 1988, 25 differend organic compounds are residues of 15 pesticides. Nine of them are allowed in groundwater protection areas: atrazine, amitrol, diuron, dichlobenil, dinoseb, ethoprophos, maneb/zineb, metamitron and <b>metam-sodium,</b> while the other six are not allowed in groundwater protection areas: aldicarb, 1, 3 -dichloropropene, bentazon, dimethoate, metolachlor and simazine.

40|$|Alternatives {{to reduce}} or modify {{nematicide}} use for minimizing groundwater contamination in Easter lily were explored in two field trials. Alternatives to standard 1, 3 -dichloropropene (1, 3 -D) plus phorate injection in the first trial were: (i) delaying applications until after winter rains, (ii) removing roots from planting stock, (iii) 1, 3 -D via drip irrigation, (iv) a chitin-urea soil amendment, (v) the registered insecticide disulfoton, and (vi) several nonregistered nematicides. None of the treatments equaled the standard treatment. In the second trial, potential benefits of adding a systemic nematicide, oxamyl (OX), or a fungicide, metalaxyl (MX), to the standard treatment were explored. Preplant drip irrigation applications of metam sodium (MS), sodium tetrathiocarbonate (ST), and emulsifiable 1, 3 -D were evaluated alone and in combination with postplant applications of OX and MX. Several drip-applied treatments performed comparably to the standard treatment {{with respect to the}} most important criteria of crop quality, bulb circumference. <b>Metam-sodium</b> in combination with either or both OX and MX, 1, 3 -D plus OX and MX, and ST plus OX and MX provided the best results...|$|E
40|$|Lompoc is a {{small city}} located in a coastal valley of Santa Barbara County, California, with {{agricultural}} fields located in the area between Lompoc and the coast. As with most California coastal valleys, the area is cool with frequent fog or low cloudiness, and winds are predominantly from the west or northwest; Lompoc is downwind from the agricultural area. The Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) conducted air monitoring in Lompoc to determine whether, and in what amounts, fumigant pesticides occur in air in residential areas of the city. Three fumigant pesticides {{are used in the}} Lompoc area: chloropicrin, methyl bromide, and methyl isothiocyanate (MITC, breakdown product of <b>metam-sodium</b> and metam-potassium). DPR monitored five locations, including two schools in Lompoc, primarily choosing higherrisk sites based on their proximity to agricultural areas. The monitoring plan targeted selected applications, specifically large fumigations in close proximity to Lompoc. DPR monitored six MITC fumigations, and two methyl bromide/chloropicrin fumigations during 2000. For each of the fumigations, DPR monitored for a 72 -hour period beginning with the start of fumigation. The 72 -hour monitoring period consisted of six alternating 8 -hour (day) and 16 hou...|$|E
40|$|Dimethyl Disulfide (DMDS), as EC and AL formulation, {{was applied}} to control the {{vascular}} wilt fungus Verticillium dahliae in greenhouse experiments conducted in the two successive seasons of 2013 and 2014. The trials were carried out in Tuscany (Italy) on chrysanthemum cultivar “Veneri”, according to a randomized block design with 3 replicates per treatment. The soil of the sites was loamy and naturally infected by V. dahliae. DMDS was applied at the rates of 600 kg ha- 1 via drip-irrigation (EC) or in shank application (AL). The treated plots were covered for 2 weeks with a very impermeable plastic film (VIF). After one week of soil aeration chrysanthemum seedlings were transplanted in each plot. DMDS treatments were compared with <b>metam-sodium</b> (1400 kg ha- 1) or chloropicrin (500 kg ha- 1) and non-treated controls and, {{at the end of}} the crop cycle, the effects of the treatments on disease incidence and crop performance were evaluated.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Fisheries Biology, 2003 In July of 1991, a train car {{filled with}} <b>metam-sodium</b> {{pesticide}} {{fell into the}} upper Sacramento River, California, killing more than 300, 000 wild rainbow trout and all aquatic life in the 38 -mile stretch of river below the spill. I compared growth of wild rainbow trout prior to and following the spill based on analysis of scale samples collected by California Department of Fish and Game in 1978, 1980 and 1986 (pre-spill) and 1994, 1996 and 1997 (post-spill). Scale analyses were supplemented by diet analysis of wild trout collected in 1998 - 2001. Back-calculated lengths at age were determined using a natural log-transformed Fraser-Lee equation, and specific growth rates {{before and after the}} spill were compared using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Back-calculated lengths and specific growth rate comparisons between pre-spill and post-spill periods provided strong evidence that growth of trout decreased following the spill, but the effect apparently was not immediate. Back-calculated trout lengths and specific growth rates from 1994 scale samples were not significantly different from pre-spill scale samples, but analysis of 1996 and 1997 scale samples showed significant decreases in both length at age and specific growth rates for age 3 and 4 trout. Specific growth rates of rainbow trout were lowest in 1995, when a severe winter occurred and high winter and spring flows were recorded. Diet analysis revealed that wild rainbow trout were consuming a diverse selection of macroinvertebrates. Large trout were getting most of their consumed energy from Dicosmoecus sp., a large caddisfly larva, but showed no evidence of sculpin consumption. The upper Sacramento River trout population may have been more susceptible to the effects of natural disturbances in the process of recovery following the spill, as trout growth rates appear to partially reflect winter severity...|$|E
40|$|Rhizoctoniasis {{of potato}} occurs in all {{regions of the}} world where the crop is grown. The disease is caused by various {{anastomosis}} groups (AGs) of the fungus Rhizoctonia solani, of which AG- 3 is the most common. Very little information is available on the AGs involved in potato rhizoctoniasis in South Africa. This study elucidated the etiology of the disease in the country and also provided guidelines regarding alternative control strategies. The vast majority (99. 3 %) of R. solani isolates from symptomatic potato tubers collected at seven of the 14 potato production regions in South Africa belonged to AG- 3, and 0. 7 % to AG- 5. Of the isolates from infected stems and roots, 82. 1 % were AG- 3, 12. 8 % AG- 4, and 5. 1 % AG- 5. Isolations from soil yielded 67. 7 % AG- 3, 22. 0 % AG- 4, 5. 5 % AG- 5, and 2. 4 % of each of AG- 7 and AG- 8. In vitro screening indicated that AG- 3 isolates were the most virulent. The progeny of seed tubers naturally infected with R. solani was rendered free of infection by dipping the tubers in hot water at 55 C for 8 minutes, 60 ºC for 6 minutes, or 65 ºC for 4 minutes. However, treatments more severe than 55 ºC for 8 minutes progressively increased tuber mortality. OA 5 DP, an organic tin complex, proved to be the most effective of 20 disinfectants for killing sclerotia of the pathogen on seed tubers and rendering the progeny free of infection, but exhibited acute phytotoxicity towards the tubers. Significant control without any phytotoxicity was achieved with the didecyl ammonium chloride compound, Sporekill. Tolclofos-methyl was the only fungicide that provided total control of potato rhizoctoniasis, whereas seed tuber treatment with fludioxonil, kresoxim-methyl and <b>metam-sodium</b> significantly reduced disease in the progeny. Incorporation of of the biocontrol formulation TrykocideTM (Trichoderma harzianum) into soils artificially infested with R. solani AG- 3 eradicated the pathogen. Significant reductions in pathogen populations were also evident in soils amended with azoxystrobin, kresoxim-methyl, MaxifloTM Azospirillum brasilense), AvogreenTM (Bacillus subtilis), cattle, chicken and sheep manure, citrus and mango waste compost, composted kraal manure, and shoot tissues of Brassica napus, B. oleracea var. capitata, Raphanus sativus, Sinapsis alba and Tagetes minuta. TrykocideTM provided total control of stem canker in artificially infested soil, whereas kresoxim-methyl, azoxystrobin, sheep manure, B. napus and B. oleracea var. capitata shoot tissue, mango waste compost, and the systemic resistance-inducing compound, acibenzolar-s-methyl, reduced the disease significantly.
