To be deemed <b>marketable</b> <b>collateral,</b> assets must be capable of being sold under normal market conditions with reasonable promptness at a fair market value.

50|$|<b>Marketable</b> <b>collateral</b> is the {{exchange}} of financial assets, such as stocks and bonds, for a loan between a financial institution and borrower. To be deemed marketable, assets must be capable of being sold under normal market conditions with reasonable promptness at current fair market value. For national banks to accept a borrower's loan proposal, collateral must be {{equal to or greater}} than 100% of the loan or credit extension amount. In the United States of America, the bank's total outstanding loans and credit extensions to one borrower may not exceed 15 percent of the bank's capital and surplus, plus an additional 10 percent of the bank's capital and surplus.|$|E
5000|$|The {{role and}} {{suggested}} functions of an ILLR {{in a crisis}} like domestic lender of last resort, as set forth by Walter Bagehot and subsequent authors, are the following: i) lending against any <b>marketable</b> <b>collateral</b> (finance) valued at its value in normal times; ii) lending in large amounts (on demand) at terms steeper than at market terms in normal times; and iii) establish the above principles ex-ante and applying them automatically.The functions of an ILLR could be undertaken by a new institution such as a global central bank, but current proposals have generally suggested {{the creation of a}} fund or facility within an existing institution, particularly the International Monetary Fund. A leading role has also occasionally been suggested for the Bank for International Settlements. [...] Less consensus exists on whether an ILLR should additionally assume the functions of a crisis manager by coordinating the responses of other relevant actors. Disagreement likewise exists regarding whether an ILLR should directly provide international liquidity to a country's financial institutions or should only provide liquidity to institutions serving as a country's financial safety nets.Based on the traditional doctrine, four desirable aspects of a feasible ILLR can be set forth: ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{importance}} of geographies of bank funding {{for the design of}} central banks’ crisis interventions in financial markets. It first distinguishes between market-based and bank-based measures to then focus on the collateral management strategies of European banks, {{in the context of an}} increasing reliance on secured market funding, to discuss a crucial policy challenge in monetary unions with integrated funding markets: banks’ ability to access market funding depends on existing portfolios of <b>marketable</b> <b>collateral</b> – in Eurozone mainly sovereign bonds. The constraints on the central bank’s ability to stabilize markets for collateral may thus worsen banks’ funding conditions through ‘coordinated risks’ between counterparty (bank) and collateral (sovereign). Since bank-based crisis policies cannot offer effective solutions for preserving the role of sovereign bonds as <b>marketable</b> <b>collateral,</b> the dilemma of how to stabilize funding markets within the existing European institutional architecture remains unresolved...|$|E
