40|$|I {{consider}} myself a passionate and dedicated naturalist. Through both experience and education, I {{have come to understand}} that some of the greatest conservation issues we face today are issues. Because problem solving is inherently an interdisciplinary field, I seek out opportunities that allow me to explore the breadth of social-ecological relationships. My main interests are broadly within human dimensions of natural resources including recreation, wildlife, and wilderness, parks, and protected area management. <b>My</b> <b>professional</b> <b>goal</b> is to become {{a professor at the university}} level and facilitate the human-nature relationship by offering authentic resolution to contemporary conservation issues through both research and teaching...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} to Rocco A.

It has not been an easy road to travel, yet you never discouraged me for doing what I am intrinsically driven to do [...] strive for excellence and meaning in my passion for improving schools for children. I fall short of excellence many, many times, and I have certainly wanted to give up on this research paper, but here it is.

40|$|During {{the summer}} of 2014, after my junior year as a physics major at the University of New Hampshire, I {{took part in a}} nine-week Research Experience for Undergraduates {{sponsored}} by the University of Michigan and the National Science Foundation. During the program, I lived and worked at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) just outside of Geneva,Switzerland. CERN is home to the largest particle collider in the world, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and is the world’s leading particle physics laboratory. As a summer student, I attended daily lectures on particle physics from leading experts in the field, carried out research under the supervision of a staff scientist, and networked with students and scientists from around the world. This experience has informed both <b>my</b> <b>professional</b> <b>goals</b> and my view of myself as a student in a global community. I was amazed by the collaboration between individuals who were from diverse countries and cultures and spoke different languages, but were able to set aside their differences to pursue a common goal...|$|E

40|$|As a Wildlife Biology {{major at}} Cal Poly, I {{was able to}} express my passion for the ocean and beaches in {{planning}} and co-designing a beach and dive clean up Earth Day celebration as my senior project. This event took place at Avila Beach on April 21 st and was hosted by the Central Coast Aquarium. It was {{open to the public}} in attempts to promote outreach and awareness of coastal conservation, allowing volunteers to participate in the clean-ups and visit the Aquarium. The event was a success, involving over 100 volunteers, collecting and recycling 150 pounds of trash and also attracting the media’s attention. We received an abundance of positive feedback from the public as well as several media reporters, evident in interviews and articles. We were able to not only clean a beach and a part of the ocean floor, but we were able to spread conservation awareness and education to the public. I gained knowledge, experience and multiple skills from my involvement of the event that will help me with <b>my</b> <b>professional</b> <b>goals</b> of further promoting and educating people on conservation and awareness of coastal communities...|$|E
40|$|From the day I took {{my first}} breath, I have been blessed by two parents, Odie and Ruth Curlee, who always {{reminded}} me I {{could do anything}} I set my mind to accomplish. Whether it was running a half-marathon or achieving <b>my</b> <b>professional</b> <b>goals,</b> their belief in me has never wavered. Their sacrifices began early, {{paving the way for}} me to pursue my dreams with abandon. While they have always been my greatest cheerleaders, they also have served as my greatest teachers. The education they provided me was simple – embrace life, look for the blessing amidst the challenge, trust God, and love others with all your heart. My dad left for heaven while I {{was in the middle of}} conducting my research, and although there were painful moments of sadness and loss, I was blessed with moments of tenderness and grace that made saying goodbye bearable. I miss you Daddy, but I feel you are in my heart and hear your whispers of love and support every single day. My mother continues to be the best role model I have ever known. She taught me at an early age what it means to be a strong woman with a tender heart and ha...|$|E
