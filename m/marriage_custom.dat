5000|$|Fran Martin is not {{blind to}} the feminist impulse that {{motivated}} the choice of Zhaohuan Lu’s short story. He notes that the girls object to [...] "the violently patriarchal marriage custom." [...] Now it is indeed true that the film portrays coarse behavior and male violence that is informed by a patriarchal sense of being in charge, whereas a woman should know her place and must obey. But the <b>marriage</b> <b>custom</b> as such, stipulating separate households of husband and wife, gives women an unusual free space and a certain measure of independence. The specific <b>marriage</b> <b>custom</b> of the ethnic Huidong group living in Fujian (SW China) is certainly no longer matriarchal {{like that of the}} Mosuo based in Yunnan (also SW China). But it tends in that direction, a fact that must have aroused the filmmakers interest in the Huidong.|$|E

5000|$|In his 2015 {{monograph}} {{investigation into}} {{the identity of the}} visionary of Our Lady of Walsingham, Edith the Fair, the historian Bill Flint identifies Edith Swanneshals as the Walsingham visionary who has been known colloquially in history as [...] "Rychold" [...] or [...] "Richeldis de Faverches". In this work, Flint overturns many of the previous assumptions made about Edith's relationship with Harold Godwinson, including the fidelity of the couple's marital union and Christian devotion. Flint argues that Edith and Harold were almost certainly married under the Danish more danico or hand-fast <b>marriage</b> <b>custom.</b> As evidence for this, he cites a number of dowry bequests that were made at the time of Edith's union to Harold. Flint notes that the bequests made included Walsingham Manor, making Edith in all probability [...] "the lady of the manor" [...] during the year of 1061, which was identified by Tudor historian Richard Pynson as the year of the foundation of the shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham.|$|E

This alternative custom influences Devdas's mother's decision of not considering Parvati as Devdas' bride, because she considers Parvati's family to be a [...] "trading low caste" [...] (becha-kena chotoghor) family, despite the fact that Parvati (like Devdas) is a Brahmin.
