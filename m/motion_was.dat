5|$|The {{convention}} reconvened at 11:00 A.M. on June 3. Roscoe Conkling {{submitted a}} motion for a recess, but the <b>motion</b> <b>was</b> rejected. Another New York delegate, Henry R. Pierson from the Committee on Permanent Organization, submitted {{a proposal to}} make the temporary convention assignments permanent. The <b>motion</b> <b>was</b> adopted, and the convention took a four-hour recess until 5:00 P.M. After the recess, a <b>motion</b> <b>was</b> made for the Committee on Rules to be directed to report, but a substitute motion from George H. Sharpe of New York called for the Committee on Credentials to report. The substitute <b>motion</b> <b>was</b> rejected {{by a vote of}} 406 to 318, and the original resolution was laid on the table. At 7:30 P.M., the convention was adjourned until 10:00 A.M. the following morning.|$|E
5|$|Anger at Turnbull's {{response}} to the 23 November 2009 meeting triggered a spill motion against his leadership three days later. The <b>motion</b> <b>was</b> moved by Kevin Andrews, a former Minister in the Howard government, but was defeated {{by a vote of}} 48 to 35. Andrews was not seen as a genuine prospect for the leadership, so the close vote on the spill <b>motion</b> <b>was</b> considered a blow to Turnbull. While Abbott supported Turnbull at the time of Andrews' spill, he subsequently resigned from the frontbench. Several others joined Abbott in resigning, including Nick Minchin, Eric Abetz, Sophie Mirabella and Tony Smith.|$|E

50|$|<b>Motions</b> can <b>be</b> {{divided into}} direct and {{indirect}} motions.Direct, proper or rigid <b>motions</b> <b>are</b> <b>motions</b> like translations and rotations that preserve the orientation of a chiral shape.Indirect, or inproper <b>motions</b> <b>are</b> <b>motions</b> like reflections, glide reflections and Improper rotations that invert the orientation of a chiral shape.Some geometers define motion {{in such a way}} that only direct <b>motions</b> <b>are</b> <b>motions.</b>|$|R

5|$|Harper's Cabinet was {{defeated}} in a no-confidence vote on March 25, 2011, after being found in contempt of parliament. Harper thus, in accordance with constitutional convention, advised the Governor General to call a general election. This was the first occurrence in Commonwealth history of a government in the Westminster parliamentary tradition losing {{the confidence of the}} lower house on the grounds of contempt of parliament. The no-confidence <b>motion</b> <b>was</b> carried with a vote of 156 in favour of the motion and 145 against.|$|E
5|$|In 1827, the British {{botanist}} Robert Brown {{observed that}} dust particles inside pollen grains floating in water constantly jiggled about {{for no apparent}} reason. In 1905, Albert Einstein theorized that this Brownian <b>motion</b> <b>was</b> caused by the water molecules continuously knocking the grains about, and developed a hypothetical mathematical model to describe it. This model was validated experimentally in 1908 by French physicist Jean Perrin, thus providing additional validation for particle theory (and by extension atomic theory).|$|E
5|$|In 2009 Phil Senter {{published}} {{a study on}} dromaeosaurid toes and showed that their range of <b>motion</b> <b>was</b> compatible with the excavation of tough insect nests. Senter suggested that small dromaeosaurids such as Rahonavis and Buitreraptor were small enough to be partial insectivores, while larger genera such as Deinonychus and Neuquenraptor could have used this ability to catch vertebrate prey residing in insect nests. However, Senter did not test whether the strong curvature of dromaeosaurid claws was also conducive to such activities.|$|E
5|$|Linear motions (or {{translatory}} motions), which {{move in a}} {{line between}} two points. Rectilinear <b>motion</b> <b>is</b> <b>motion</b> {{in a straight line}} between two points, whereas curvilinear <b>motion</b> <b>is</b> <b>motion</b> following a curved path.|$|R
40|$|The {{motion of}} two and four {{rectilinear}} vortices inside a cylindrical pipe is studied under the restriction that the total circulation be zero.

In the four-vortex case, the <b>motion</b> <b>is</b> determined not to be periodic in general. However, a class of solutions where the <b>motion</b> <b>is</b> periodic is found. Several sample calculations of the vortex <b>motion</b> <b>are</b> included...|$|R
25|$|In practice, {{below the}} {{critical}} speed, the lag {{between the two}} <b>motions</b> <b>is</b> {{less than a quarter}} cycle so that the <b>motion</b> <b>is</b> damped out but, above the critical speed, the lag is greater than a quarter cycle so that the <b>motion</b> <b>is</b> amplified.|$|R
5|$|In 2012, Tracy McPherson of the Pennsylvanian Pastafarians {{petitioned the}} Chester County, Pennsylvania Commissioners to allow {{representation}} of the FSM at the county courthouse, equally with a Jewish menorah and a Christian nativity scene.

5|$|In April 1998, Wooller {{claimed that}} the council of the ICAEW was obstructing his {{campaign}} to increase democracy after it refused to allow the original text of motions that were to be published to be heard at the annual general meeting in June 1998. Wooller's first <b>motion</b> <b>was</b> about electing {{the president of the}} ICAEW democratically by ballot. The other two motions came about from the Gerrard report. The second motion said the district societies should be self-financing and the third <b>motion</b> <b>was</b> on reducing the number of council members to fifty-three. The first motion used a quotation from an Accountancy Age interview with council member Ian Hay Davison, and Wooller was told to stop circulating Hay Davison's quotation after he objected to being quoted. The ICAEW asked members to vote on {{an increase in the number}} of council members from seventy-five after requests made in the Gerrard report. Wooller asked members to reduce the number of council members to fifty-three, which was recommended by the Gerrard report as the ideal council quota. A 54% majority of the ICAEW members supported Wooller's motion to reduce the number.|$|E

During the rest of April, Hacker had a lot of trouble in dealing with runners on base, because his pitching <b>motion</b> <b>was</b> vulnerable to stolen bases.

5|$|The Mississippi ships had poor {{seakeeping}} qualities, {{making them}} poor gunnery platforms underway in Atlantic waters. Their <b>motion</b> <b>was</b> irregular, and their low length-to-beam ratio caused excessive rolling and pitching, {{which made it}} difficult to keep the guns on target. The reduced length, significantly cut away from the aft, {{made it difficult to}} keep the ships on a consistent course, even in smoother waters.|$|E

5|$|A {{meeting of}} the {{parliamentary}} party was held on 15 September at which {{the issue of the}} presidential election was raised. Unexpectedly, one of the party's senators, Labhrás Ó Murchú, sought nominations to run as an independent candidate. This was widely seen as a challenge to the authority of Micheál Martin. The extended meeting broke up without agreement. The parliamentary party met again on 20 September. Senator Ó Murchú withdrew his request for a nomination and a <b>motion</b> <b>was</b> passed that the party's Oireachtas members would not nominate or endorse any candidate. The decision was seen as a severe blow to the attempts to secure a nomination by David Norris and Dana Rosemary Scallon who were expected to need signatures from individual Fianna Fáil members.|$|E
