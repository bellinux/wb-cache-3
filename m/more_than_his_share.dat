25|$|When Melville's {{paternal}} grandfather died on September 16, 1832, {{it emerged}} that Allan had borrowed <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>his</b> <b>share</b> of the inheritance, and Maria Melville consequently received only $20. The grandmother died on April 12, 1833. Melville did his job {{well at the}} bank; though he was only fourteen in 1834, the bank considered him competent enough {{to be sent to}} Schenectady on an errand. Not much else is known from this period, except that he was very fond of drawing. The visual arts became a lifelong interest.|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity {{above and}} beyond the call of duty. On 1 August 1943, he served as pilot of the lead aircraft in his group in a daring low-level attack against enemy oil refineries and installations at Ploesti, Rumania. Although he had completed <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>his</b> <b>share</b> of missions and was no longer connected with this group, so high was his conception of duty that he volunteered to lead the formation in the correct belief that his participation would contribute materially to success in this attack. Maj. Jerstad led the formation into attack with full realization of the extreme hazards involved and despite withering fire from heavy and light antiaircraft guns. Three miles from the target his airplane was hit, badly damaged, and set on fire. Ignoring {{the fact that he was}} flying over a field suitable for a forced landing, he kept on the course. After the bombs of his aircraft were released on the target, the fire in his ship became so intense as to make further progress impossible and he crashed into the target area. By his voluntary acceptance of a mission he knew was extremely hazardous, and his assumption of an intrepid course of action at the risk of life over and above the call of duty, Maj. Jerstad set an example of heroism which will be an inspiration to the U.S. Armed Forces.|$|E
500|$|During the innings, Lindwall {{appealed for}} lbw four times while wicket-keeper Ron Saggers—standing {{in for the}} injured Tallon—remained silent, not {{supporting}} the appeal. England ran up a large score of 496 but squandered a very strong position after losing their last 8 wickets for 73 runs; Lindwall had Compton caught down the leg side to give Saggers his first Test catch, leaving England at 6/473. Lindwall ended with 2/79 from 38 overs. Fingleton said [...] "this grand fast bowler held the side together splendidly and answered every call". O’Reilly said that until England collapsedmostly due to unforced errors despite favourable conditionsonly Lindwall appeared capable of threatening the batsmen. He said the paceman [...] "kept slogging away, tirelessly retaining his pace and enthusiasm long after {{the other members of}} the attack had lost all signs of hostility...Bradman could not afford to spare him from doing much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>his</b> <b>share</b> of the galley-slave work." [...] O’Reilly decried Lindwall’s workload as excessive and potentially harmful to his longevity.|$|E

500|$|Edrich and Bedser {{continued}} to amass runs after the break, and Lindwall appealed for lbw {{for the fourth}} time while Saggers remained silent. The pair brought up their century partnership as England scored 22 runs in the 30 minutes after lunch. Johnson came on, and Edrich lofted him for six to reach 96. Edrich then hit a long hop from the part-time wrist spin of Arthur Morris for four to reach his century. Bedser joined the attack and lifted Morris high over square leg for six, and Bradman replaced him with Toshack, who bowled a maiden. O'Reilly said that during the partnership, only Lindwall appeared capable of threatening the batsmen. He said Lindwall [...] "kept slogging away, tirelessly retaining his pace and enthusiasm long after {{the other members of the}} attack had lost all signs of hostility…Bradman could not afford to spare him from doing much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>his</b> <b>share</b> of the galley-slave work." [...] O'Reilly decried Lindwall's workload as excessive and potentially harmful to his longevity. However, against the run of play, Bedser was out caught and bowled by Johnson after almost three hours of batting, ending a 155-run stand for the third wicket. His on-drive was intercepted by the bowler, who dived across the pitch to his right-hand side to complete the catch. Bedser had struck eight fours and two sixes in a Test best of 79. He appeared upset by his dismissal, patting the ball back to the bowler when he could have hit it decisively. Edrich attempted to pull a Johnson long hop to the leg side, targeting the large gap between square leg and mid-on, but only ballooned the ball to Morris, who completed the catch diving forwards at wide mid-on. This came after only three runs after Bedser's dismissal and left the score at 426/4. Edrich had batted for 314 minutes in compiling 111, with 13 fours and a six.|$|E
500|$|Fender {{completed}} the double in 1922 with 1,169 runs and 157 wickets, Surrey {{finished third in}} the Championship, and once again the lack of effective bowling hindered the team. Wisden described the team's success as [...] "nothing less than a triumph for Mr Fender". Despite damp weather which did not suit his style, he bowled <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>his</b> <b>share</b> of overs, often because there were few alternative bowlers. Wisden said: [...] "Essentially a change bowler —the best in England, as he has been aptly described—he became by force of circumstances the chief attacking force". He bowled mainly leg spin, but often bowled successfully at medium pace. Wisden praised his inspirational captaincy, and concluded: [...] "Over and above all this he was, by general consent, by far the best of the county captains, never losing his grip of the game and managing his side with a judgement that was seldom at fault." [...] During the season, Fender began to wear glasses in an attempt to cure headaches; the remedy worked, although he later discovered {{there was nothing wrong with}} his eyesight, and the lenses he wore were little more than plain glass. The first time he wore glasses, Fender scored 185 in 130 minutes against Hampshire. Other rapid scoring feats included 91 in 50 minutes against Leicestershire and 137 in 90 minutes against Kent. There were no Tests in 1922, but Sydney Pardon wrote that Fender was the only amateur who could be guaranteed a place on ability alone in an England team. Late in the season, Fender was involved in a public dispute with Lord Harris over the qualification of Alfred Jeacocke to play for Surrey. Harris, the influential treasurer of the MCC and chairman of Kent, had noticed that Jeacocke's qualification had lapsed when he moved across the border from Surrey to Kent, albeit living on the same road. Fender, privately furious with Harris, publicly defended Jeacocke, and the press supported him; the rules were altered the following season to allow Jeacocke to continue to play for Surrey.|$|E
2500|$|Like most people, pirates [...] "were {{creatures of}} incentives." [...] Piracy allowed a crew {{to benefit from}} [...] "every penny of its ship's ill-gotten booty." [...] One's share of the plunder was {{directly}} proportionate to a crewman's job aboard the ship, and was outlined in the ship's articles. If a pirate were to take <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>his</b> <b>share,</b> hide in times of war, or was dishonest with the crew, he [...] "risked being deposited" [...] somewhere unpleasant and full of hardships. Also, ships {{were not the only}} things that were able to be plundered. A select group of pirates also attacked a Sierra Leone fort and several fortresses used for the slave trade.|$|E

Saidy and Lessing wrote that, [...] "He can hardly be blamed if the struggles and privations of his youth warped his character so that he became a jealous, suspicious, and vitriolic man." ...|$|R
