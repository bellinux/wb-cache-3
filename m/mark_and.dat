40|$|This thesis {{work has}} been {{conducted}} at International Automotive Components Group in Torslanda, Sweden. The company produces door panels, instrument panels, consoles and cockpits for the automotive industry. During the production of door panels, defects such as pressure <b>marks</b> <b>and</b> scratches emerge which results in scrap and rework. The objective of the thesis work was to identify the causes of pressure <b>marks</b> <b>and</b> scratches and also to suggest measures {{to reduce the amount}} of scrap and rework on door panels. Through observations, interviews and experiments, several causes leading to pressure <b>marks</b> <b>and</b> scratches on door panels were identified. Small pieces of plastics on fixtures, the operator's rough handling and specific process steps are the main causes that result in pressure <b>marks</b> <b>and</b> scratches. Pressure <b>marks</b> <b>and</b> scratches emerge at several places on the door panels during the production. To reduce the amount of pressure <b>marks</b> <b>and</b> scratches both short-term and long-term measures were suggested. Some of the measures are:  Use vacuum cleaners at some stations  Add padding on unpadded areas and edges  Make new instructions that emphasize to keep production stations clean and to avoid rough handling  Introduce workshops to engage operator...|$|R
