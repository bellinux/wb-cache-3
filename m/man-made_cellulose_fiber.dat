Only non-renewable energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are considered. The scope is cradle to grave excluding the use phase. The results show that both recycled and bio-based ma terials offer important environmental benefits over single-use petrochemical PET. Among the four PET product systems studied, recycled (partially) bio-based PET has the lowest impacts, followed by recycled PET, (partially) biobased PET, and petrochemical PET. PLA and <b>man-made</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibers</b> produced in an integrated plant have lower impacts than both petrochemical PET and bio-based PET. The impacts of recycled products are strongly influenced by the choice of the allocation method applied to open-loop recycling...|$|R

The aerogels were prepared via two drying techniques: ambient pressure drying and with supercritical CO 2, in both cases resulting in monolithic non-brittle materials. The influence of fiber length and concentration on the thermal conductivity and flexural properties of both types of composite aerogels was evaluated. Thermal conductivity in room conditions varied from 0. 015 to 0. 018 W. K- 1. m- 1; it slightly increased with fiber concentration but remained in superinsulation domain. The importance of fiber percolation concentration for synthesizing monolithic ambient pressure dried composite aerogels was demonstrated.

40|$|International audienceAmbient {{pressure}} drying of the silica-based alcogels is used {{to produce}} lower cost thermal superinsulating materials and to have more flexibility in the manufacturing process regarding to sample shape and size. In this work we demonstrate that short <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibers</b> incorporated into silica aerogels allow making monolithic, not brittle and thermal superinsulating ambient dried aerogels. We have compared {{the effects of the}} different cellulosic fibers on the properties of silica-based composite aerogels produced both via ambient drying and the supercritical (sc) CO 2 drying methods. The aerogels with 0. 7 to 3 final vol% of fibers were synthesized and after hydrophobization of silica phase, were dried via either ambient pressure or sc drying methods. The subsequent materials showed thermal conductivities as low as 0. 016 W/m. K in room conditions. The presence of the fibers in the silica matrix restrained drastically the material shrinkage during the evaporative drying, prevented silica breakage into particles and allowed maintaining initial monolithicity and volume of the composite gels due to “spring-back” effect. The bulk densities of ambient and sc CO 2 dried samples were similar. The addition of <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibers</b> significantly increased the Young’s modulus of the aerogels. While pure silica aerogels are very brittle (strain at break of few %), aerogel composites, both sc and ambient dried, are not brittle. This original aerogel preparation method was also successfully demonstrated with <b>man-made</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibers</b> as well as natural fibers from wood and flax.

40|$|International audienceAmbient dried silica aerogels, {{formerly}} so-called silica xerogels, possess morphology and properties {{really close}} to silica aerogels except one important point: during ambient pressure drying silica gel breaks {{into small pieces}} because of high capillary pressure developed in the system. However, when silica gel is “reinforced” by a non-woven fiber matrix, the materials, so-called “blankets”, can be obtained via ambient pressure drying. As well as silica aerogels obtained via drying in supercritical conditions, “blankets” have thermal superinsulating properties with thermal conductivity in room conditions considerably below that of air, 0. 013 – 0. 017 W/m. K vs 0. 025 W/m. K, respectively. One of the main drawbacks of “blankets” is {{the high level of}} release of silica powder.

40|$|The {{experiences}} on cellulose research in our region, first in Teltow {{and later in}} Potsdam-Golm, have extended over many years since the 1920 s with {{the foundation of the}} Vereinigte Glanzstoff-Fabriken in Teltow-Seehof, followed by the Institut für Faserforschung and the Institut für Polymerforschung of the Academy of Sciences of the GDR, up to the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Polymer Research IAP, which is now situated in Potsdam-Golm. While the original fiber production in Teltow-Seehof was based on the viscose process, which is still the dominating process for producing <b>man-made</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibers,</b> alternative ecologically friendly procedures have been developed {{in the course of the}} years. One of these developments concerns the so called CarbaCell process, whereby the chemical modification of cellulose with urea (instead of carbon disulphide in the viscose process) leads to cellulose carbamate, which can be spun and regenerated. Another alternative is the direct solution procedure in N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide monohydrate (NMMNO*H 2 O). This non-derivatizing solvent for cellulose can also be used for several homogeneous chemical reactions, whereby in comparison with the classical heterogeneous slurry processes, a completely different distribution of substituents in the anhydroglucose unit and also along the polymer chain is achieved. The substitution pattern has a high influence on the properties of the products, especially on the solution behavior. Also, anorganic cellulose esters like phosphates and sulfates can be synthesized regioselectively at positions C 6 or C 2 /C 3. Especially the cellulose sulfate with substitutions at position C 6 is a suitable material for the micro-encapsulation of living cells for clinical applications. Slightly substituted cellulose derivatives are also the starting point for the formation of nanocellulose, which is prepared as a clear and opalescent dispersion after a mechanical treatment. Another subject matter is the development of starch-based materials. Starting from thermoplastic starch by adding a plasticizer, highly substituted starch esters are developed, which show mechanical properties like petrochemical-based thermoplastic materials. A short overview of some research activities on the topics of cellulose and starch at the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Polymer Research IAP over the last 20 years is presented...|$|R

Moreover, the use of <b>man-made</b> continuous regenerated <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibers</b> for this purpose could result in unidirectional all-cellulose composites with excellent mechanical properties. In this study, a new processing technique for unidirectional all-cellulose composites, reinforced with continuous regenerated <b>cellulose</b> nanocomposite <b>fibers,</b> has been developed, where the fibers are wound directly after the coagulation bath and then welded together while still being swelled in order to form all-cellulose composite sheets without the need of adding any additional solvent or chemicals. Scanning electron microscopy and tensile testing were used to investigate and compare the microstructure and mechanical properties, of a reference material without nanoreinforced fibers and two variants reinforced with 2 % cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and 2 % halloysite nanotubes (HNTs).

40|$|The {{production}} {{of textile materials}} has undergone {{dramatic changes in the}} last century. <b>Man-made</b> <b>cellulose</b> fibres have played an important role for more than 70 years. Today, the <b>man-made</b> <b>cellulose</b> fibre industry is the worldwide second largest biorefinery (next to the paper industry). In the last few years, the interest in <b>man-made</b> <b>cellulose</b> fibres has grown as a consequence of increased environmental awareness and the depletion of fossil fuels. However, an environmental assessment of modern <b>man-made</b> <b>cellulose</b> fibres has not been conducted so far. The {{purpose of this study is}} to assess the environmental impact of <b>man-made</b> <b>cellulose</b> fibres. Five staple fibre products, i. e., 1) Lenzing Viscose Asia, 2) Lenzing Viscose Austria, 3) Lenzing Modal, 4) Tencel Austria, and 5) Tencel Austria 2012, are analysed by means of Life cycle assessment (LCA). The system boundary is cradle to factory gate. We compare the results with conventional cotton, novel bio-based fibres (PLA fibres), and fossil fuel-based fibres (PET and PP). The inventory data for the {{production of}} <b>man-made</b> <b>cellulose</b> fibres were provided by Lenzing AG. The inventory data for cotton, PET, PP, and PLA were obtained from literature sources. The environmental indicators analysed include resources and the impact categories covered by CML 2000 baseline method. The indicators for resources include non-renewable energy use (NREU), renewable energy use (REU), cumulative energy demand (CED), water use, and land use. The environmental impact indicators covered by the CML method are global warming potential (GWP) 100 a, abiotic depletion, ozone layer depletion, human toxicity, fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity, photochemical oxidation, acidification, and eutrophication. In addition, the system boundary of cradle to factory gate plus end-of-life waste management was analysed for NREU and GWP. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses have been carried out to understand the influence of various assumptions and allocation methods. The LCA results show that Lenzing Viscose Austria and Lenzing Modal offer environmental benefits in all categories (except for land use and water use) compared to Lenzing Viscose Asia.
