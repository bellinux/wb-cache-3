25|$|The upper jaws {{were lined}} with between 12 and 15 blade-like teeth on each side. The paired premaxillary bone, which formed {{the tip of the}} snout, {{contained}} merely three teeth on each half, less than in most other theropods. Each half of the lower jaw was equipped with 11 to 15 teeth that were slightly straighter and less sturdy than those of the upper jaw. The tooth crowns of the upper jaw were exceptionally long, measuring up to 9.3cm in length in the largest specimen, which is equal to the <b>minimum</b> <b>height</b> of the lower jaw. In the smaller holotype specimen, the length of the upper tooth crowns (7cm) even surpasses the <b>minimum</b> <b>height</b> of the lower jaw (6.3cm) – in other theropods, this feature is only known from the possibly closely related Genyodectes. In contrast, several members of the related Abelisauridae feature very low tooth crowns.|$|E

While at Dartmouth, Reich {{went on a}} date with Hillary Rodham, the future Hillary Clinton, then an undergraduate at Wellesley College. While a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, Reich first met Bill Clinton, also a Rhodes Scholar. Although he was drafted to serve in the Vietnam War, he did not pass the physical as he was under the required <b>minimum</b> <b>height</b> of five feet. Reich subsequently earned a J.D. from Yale Law School, where he was an editor of the Yale Law Journal. At Yale, he was classmates with Bill and Hillary Clinton, Clarence Thomas, Michael Medved and Richard Blumenthal.|$|E
25|$|The <b>minimum</b> <b>height</b> {{requirement}} for Mission: Space is 44inches (112cm). Spiels and warnings throughout the attraction caution {{that people who}} do not like enclosed dark spaces, simulators, spinning, or are prone to motion sickness should not ride. Signs also warn that the ride may cause nausea, headache, dizziness, or disorientation, and that people prone to motion sickness, or who have a headache or an inner ear problem, or who have a history of migraines, vertigo, or elevated anxiety also should not ride. These signs are similar to those present at considerably less-intense rides in the same park, such as Soarin'. There are also signs which instruct the rider to keep their head flat against the headrest, stating that if one ignores this, the centrifugal motion acting on one's head can cause undesirable effects such as dizziness and/or headaches, or possibly even more serious effects.|$|E

25|$|At {{the debut}} {{pre-season}} game of Cowboys Stadium, a punt by Tennessee Titans kicker, A. J. Trapasso, hit the 2,100 in. screen above the field. The punt deflected and was ruled in-play until Titans coach Jeff Fisher informed the officials that the punt struck the scoreboard. (Many believe Trapasso {{was trying to}} hit the suspended scoreboard, based on replays and {{the angle of the}} kick.) The scoreboard is, however, within the regulation of the NFL guidelines — hanging approximately five feet above the <b>minimum</b> <b>height.</b> No punts hit the scoreboard during the entire 2009 regular season during an actual game. Also, on August 22, 2009, the day after AJ Trapasso hit the screen, many fans touring the facility noted that half of the field was removed with large cranes re-positioning the screen. According to some fans, a tour guide explained that Jerry Jones invited a few professional soccer players to drop kick soccer balls to try to hit the screen. Once he observed them hitting it consistently he had the screen moved up another 10 feet.|$|E

500|$|Although [...] "tree" [...] {{is a term}} {{of common}} parlance, there is no universally {{recognised}} precise definition of what a tree is, either botanically or in common language.
