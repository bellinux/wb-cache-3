Method is validated on comparing results obtained for PLZT 8 / 65 / 35 and P 188, whose parameters are well known in literature.

40|$|In {{the present}} study the {{intrinsic}} strain softening behaviour of amorphous polymers is investi-gated. Intrinsic strain softening induces localisation phenomena in tensile deformation which are {{a key factor in}} the brittle fracture process of for instance PS and PMMA. Our hypothesis is, that by reducing the strain softening localisation of strain can be reduced or eliminated and tough <b>macroscopic</b> deformation <b>behaviour</b> can be obtained. From literature it is known that a thermal or mechanical pre-treatment of the material can reduce the amount of strain softening or the so-called ’yield-drop’. Therefore, tensile bars of PS and PMMA are tested in compression at different tem-peratures and strain rates to investigate the intrinsic properties. Next tensile tests are performed {{to examine the effects of}} the altered intrinsic properties on the <b>macroscopic</b> deformation <b>behaviour.</b> PS and PMMA prove to deform ductile at elevated temperatures and low strain rates. Examining the yield-drop as function of temperature and strain rate points out that under a certain level of yield-drop, <b>macroscopic</b> tough deformation <b>behaviour</b> is observed. Tensile bars of PS and PC are also subjected to mechanical rejuvenation. A subsequent tensile and compression tests shows that due to the reduction of strain softening tough deformation behaviour is obtained for PS, and homogeneous deformation without necking is observed in PC. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract When {{designing}} decentralised multi-agent systems (MASs), {{a fundamental}} engineering issue {{is to achieve}} a <b>macroscopic</b> <b>behaviour</b> that meets the requirements and emerges only from the self-organising behaviour of locally interacting agents. Agent-oriented methodologies today are mainly focussed on engineering the microscopic issues, i. e. the agents, their rules, how they interact, etc, without explicit support for engineering the required <b>macroscopic</b> <b>behaviour.</b> As a consequence, the <b>macroscopic</b> <b>behaviour</b> is achieved in an ad-hoc manner. This paper proposes a way to define a full life-cycle methodology based on an industry-ready software engineering process, i. e. the Unified Process, which is customised to explicitly focus on engineering <b>macroscopic</b> <b>behaviour</b> of decentralised MASs. As such, the MAS paradigm is integrated into an existing and widely accepted methodology and we can systematically develop a solution that exhibits the required <b>macroscopic</b> <b>behaviour.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|We present two {{strategies}} {{to enhance the}} dynamical entanglement transfer from continuous variable (CV) to finite dimensional systems by employing multiple qubits. First, we consider the entanglement transfer to a composite finite dimensional system of many qubits simultaneously interacting with a bipartite CV field. We show that, considering realistic conditions in the generation of CV entanglement, a small (``mesoscopic'') number of qubits resonantly coupled to the CV system is sufficient for an almost complete dynamical transfer of the entanglement. Our analysis also sheds further light on the transition between mesoscopic and <b>macroscopic</b> <b>behaviours</b> of composite finite dimensional systems coupled to bosonic fields (like atomic clouds interacting with light). Furthermore, we present a protocol based on sequential interactions of the CV system with some ancillary qubit systems and on subsequent measurements, allowing to probabilistically convert CV entanglement into `almost perfect' Bell pairs of two qubits. Our proposals are suited for realizations in various experimental settings, ranging from cavity-QED to cavity-integrated superconducting devices...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{behaviour}} of {{high temperature}} sodium when spread into air {{is not well}} known, although of capital interest in preparing safety systems in plants that use large amounts of it. A new set-up was built to produce high temperature liquid sodium sprays and jets, that were observed when produced in nitrogen inert atmosphere and in air. Sodium sprays were produced by sub-millimetric nozzles simulating a small leakage, while a rupture diaphragm of 30 millimetres diameter simulated a more severe failure. Sodium was pressurised up to 9 bar, and heated up to 550 °C, while the surrounding gas, nitrogen or air, was kept at atmospheric conditions. High speed cinematography was used to observe the liquid <b>macroscopic</b> <b>behaviours,</b> while Phase Doppler Interpherometry {{was used to measure}} the sodium droplets velocity and size, when possible.
