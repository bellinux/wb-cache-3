During the closest flyby—G2—Galileo passed just 264km {{from the surface}} of Ganymede. During a G1 flyby in 1996, the Ganymedian magnetic field was discovered, while the discovery of the ocean was announced in 2001. Galileo transmitted a large number of spectral images and discovered several non-ice compounds on the surface of Ganymede. The most recent close observations of Ganymede were made by New Horizons, which recorded topographic and compositional <b>mapping</b> <b>data</b> of Europa and Ganymede during its flyby of Jupiter in 2007 en route to Pluto.|$|E

OpenStreetMap data is collected by volunteers and is available under the Open Database License. Flickr offers printing of various forms of merchandise, including business cards, photo books, stationery, personalized credit cards and large-size prints from companies such as Moo, Blurb, Tiny Prints, Capital One, Imagekind and QOOP. The Flickr partnership with Getty Images to sell stock photos from users is under review as of early 2014.|$|E
25|$|In South Korea, {{the game}} was not officially {{released}} as major restrictions {{on the use of}} online <b>mapping</b> <b>data</b> exist. However, due to a glitch, a small area around Sokcho in the northeastern part of the country was considered a part of Niantic's North Korea mapping region, making the game fully playable in that area. Numerous people took advantage of the gap to play the game. Bus tickets from the capital city of Seoul sold out and people living within Sokcho shared information on free Wi-Fi areas to tourists. Players also discovered a gym in Panmunjom, along the Korean Demilitarized Zone; however, Niantic later removed it from the game. Following the release of Pokémon Go in Japan, parts of Busan also became playable as parts of the city are considered part of Japan's mapping area due to the proximity of Tsushima Island. The game officially released in the country in January 2017.|$|E

25|$|In 1977, Schmidtke {{and colleagues}} showed that isozyme {{complexity}} {{is similar in}} amphioxus and tunicates, contradicting a prediction of Ohno's hypothesis that genome duplication occurred in the common ancestor of amphioxus and vertebrates. However, this analysis did not examine vertebrates, so could say nothing about later duplication events. (Furthermore, much later molecular phylogenetics has shown that vertebrates are {{more closely related to}} tunicates than to amphioxus, thus negating the logic of this analysis.) The 2R hypothesis saw a resurgence of interest in the 1990s for two reasons. First, gene <b>mapping</b> <b>data</b> in humans and mice revealed extensive paralogy regions - sets of genes on one chromosome related to sets of genes on another chromosome in the same species, indicative of duplication events in evolution. Paralogy regions were generally in sets of four. Second, cloning of Hox genes in amphioxus revealed presence of a single Hox gene cluster, in contrast to the four clusters in humans and mice. Data from additional gene families revealed a common one-to-many rule when amphioxus and vertebrate genes were compared. Taken together, these two lines of evidence suggest that two genome duplications occurred in the ancestry of vertebrates, after it had diverged from the cephalochordate evolutionary lineage.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to his seminal work on the amino acid sequence of insulin, Frederick Sanger and his colleagues {{played a key role}} in the development of DNA sequencing techniques that enabled the establishment of comprehensive genome sequencing projects. In 1975, he and Alan Coulson published a sequencing procedure using DNA polymerase with radiolabelled nucleotides that he called the Plus and Minus technique. This involved two closely related methods that generated short oligonucleotides with defined 3' termini. These could be fractionated by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel (called polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and visualised using autoradiography. The procedure could sequence up to 80 nucleotides in one go and was a big improvement, but was still very laborious. [...] Nevertheless, in 1977 his group was able to sequence most of the 5,386 nucleotides of the single-stranded bacteriophage φX174, completing the first fully sequenced DNA-based genome. The refinement of the Plus and Minus method resulted in the chain-termination, or Sanger method (see below), which formed the basis of the techniques of DNA sequencing, genome <b>mapping,</b> <b>data</b> storage, and bioinformatic analysis most widely used in the following quarter-century of research. In the same year Walter Gilbert and Allan Maxam of Harvard University independently developed the Maxam-Gilbert method (also known as the chemical method) of DNA sequencing, involving the preferential cleavage of DNA at known bases, a less efficient method. For their groundbreaking work in the sequencing of nucleic acids, Gilbert and Sanger shared half the 1980 Nobel Prize in chemistry with Paul Berg (recombinant DNA).|$|E

While work on Topic Map Web Services (TMWS) [1][2][3][4][5] have begun to provide developers with SOA type patterns for interacting with Topic <b>Map</b> <b>data</b> {{there is still a}} need for developers {{to be able to work}} with higher level views of the topic <b>map</b> <b>data.</b> TMAPI [6] has been the de-facto mechanism by which developers have accessed and updated topic <b>map</b> <b>data.</b> Topic <b>Map</b> Objects marries the advances in TMWS development with advances in modern language features of Java and C#. The result is a framework that allows developers to work with classes and objects that are relevant to the problem domain at hand. The expected contribution from this development is that developers can more easily use and work with topic maps with only a limited amount of knowledge about the full Topic <b>Map</b> <b>Data</b> Model (TMDM) [7]. In addition, developers will spend less time writing specific access code in order to construct domain specific applications...|$|R
