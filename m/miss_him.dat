5|$|After {{watching}} Jackass, Peter and his friends, Cleveland, Quagmire, and Joe are impressed into filming {{their own}} highly dangerous stunts. In one stunt, Peter attempts to jump a lake but instead crashes into a tree, {{causing him to}} fall into the lake and become incapacitated. Brian swims out to save him from drowning, but strains his back during the rescue and also ends up stranded in the water along with Peter, before being rescued by Joe. Lois berates Peter for his actions, since Brian is becoming old and has been smoking and drinking. Peter begins to grow upset about Brian's age so he obtains another dog and names him New Brian. His positive attitude and desirable personality make Brian feel like an outcast and Brian becomes sad that he is now unloved, and rejected. For example in one scene, when the Griffins hear New Brian fart, they think it is cute and when Brian does it, they get furious and kick him out. He ultimately decides to leave the residence, while his family begins to <b>miss</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

While he towers above most of us physically, this attribute is matched by his intellect, faith in the process and optimism for peaceful resolution of conflict.|$|E
25|$|On October 10, 2001, boxing trainer Eddie Futch {{died at age}} 90. Tim Smith of the New York Daily News remembered an {{encounter}} with the trainer in an article. One of the last times I saw Futch was before the Floyd Mayweather Jr.–Diego Corrales junior lightweight title bout in Vegas. Futch {{was talking about how}} much he admired Mayweather's style, how Mayweather was such a beautiful boxer, able to slip along the ropes and avoid punches. Corrales {{said he was going to}} neutralize Mayweather's hand speed by hitting Mayweather on the arms. 'I guess he thinks he's going to stand there and let him hit him on the arms all night,' said Futch, who correctly predicted that Mayweather would completely dismantle Corrales in a defensive masterpiece. Futch had a way of cutting to the heart of a matter. I don't know anyone in boxing who won't <b>miss</b> <b>him.</b> I don't know anyone in boxing that can take his place.|$|E

500|$|The actor {{was more}} {{successful}} in 2006 with his role opposite Jamie Foxx in Michael Mann's action crime drama, Miami Vice. The film grossed $164million worldwide on a budget of $135million, and TimeOut New York ranked it among the top 50 movies of the decade. (The DVD, released the same year, also managed to sell over a million copies (equivalent to $7.91 million in pirated versions) in its first week alone., and, as of 11 February 2007, had grossed over $36.45million in rentals. A. O. Scott criticised Farrell's work: [...] "When he's not on screen, you don't <b>miss</b> <b>him,</b> and when he is, you find yourself, before long, looking at someone or something else." [...] Conversely, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was enthusiastic. The actor also reportedly took a slight pay cut to make friend and recent Oscar winner Jamie Foxx happy: His salary was initially larger than Foxx's.|$|E
500|$|An unnamed narrator (Callum Keith Rennie), {{who as a}} {{teenager}} intended to be the [...] "Michael Jordan of sex" [...] or [...] "Wayne Gretzky with a hard-on", discusses how he met {{and fell in love}} with an older man named Frank. After the two met at a group sex session, they began an older brother–younger brother fantasy and moved in together. Frank has a voracious sexual appetite and, at times, invites the narrator for whole-day sex sessions. He is a tender lover, teaching his partner how to fly a box kite and cooking omelettes for him. The narrator is pleased with Frank's attentions and their sexual experimentation, although he is initially confused by Frank's insistence on listening to Peter Gzowski's Morningside during sex. As their ten-year anniversary approaches, Frank– having lost much weight and developed Kaposi's sarcomas– has been diagnosed with AIDS, leaving the narrator stunned; he concludes the narration with [...] "I'm going to <b>miss</b> <b>him.</b> [...] He was the best friend I ever had." ...|$|E
500|$|Louise's {{relationship}} with the two sisters closest to the Queen, Beatrice and Helena, was strained at best. Beatrice had married the tall and handsome Prince Henry of Battenberg in a love match in 1885, and they had four children. Louise, who had a jealous nature, had grown accustomed to treating Beatrice with pity {{on account of the}} Queen's constant need for her. Beatrice's biographer, Matthew Dennison, claims that in contrast to Beatrice, Louise remained strikingly good looking throughout her forties. Louise and her husband were no longer close, and rumours spread about Lorne's alleged homosexuality. Thus, Beatrice was enjoying a satisfying sexual {{relationship with}} her popular husband, which Louise was not. Louise may have considered Prince Henry a more appropriate husband for herself. Certainly, following Prince Henry's death in 1896, Louise wrote that: [...] "he [...] was almost the greatest friend I had—I, too, <b>miss</b> <b>him</b> more than I can say". In addition, Louise attempted to champion her late brother-in-law by announcing that she was his confidante and that Beatrice, a mere cipher, meant nothing to him.|$|E

News organizations reported that Bubbles was not brought to the singer's memorial service, but instead stayed at the Center for Great Apes. It has not been revealed whether Jackson left money to support Bubbles, whose care, to date, has been paid for from public donations. Animal trainer Dunn, speaking to the News of the World, stated that the chimpanzee would miss Jackson. [...] "Bubbles definitely missed him when they parted and will <b>miss</b> <b>him</b> now. Chimpanzees are intelligent. They remember people and stuff. Bubbles and Michael were close friends and playmates. The last time Michael visited, Bubbles definitely recognized and remembered him."

500|$|Cortana {{returns in}} the third {{installment}} in the Halo series, the 2007 Xbox 360 game Halo 3. During gameplay, Cortana appears to the player in broken transmissions, often reciting lines from Fall of Reach and earlier games. Cortana manages {{to send a message}} to the Master Chief on Earth through a [...] Flood-infected ship. In her message, she states that Gravemind is unaware of the portal opened by a Forerunner artifact on Earth. Cortana continues to appear to the Chief, who later recovers her from Flood-controlled High Charity. Surprised that the Chief has against all odds rescued her (as promised) Cortana produces the Index from Installation 04, which she has kept as a souvenir. With it, Cortana activates a new ringworld being constructed. While the Flood are destroyed as planned, the slipspace portal through which Master Chief, the Arbiter, and Cortana attempt to escape collapses, thus stranding the Chief and Cortana. Cortana activates a distress beacon, but she knows that years could pass before rescue comes. As the Master Chief prepares to go into cryonic sleep to await rescue, Cortana confides to him that she will <b>miss</b> <b>him.</b> He replies to wake him when she needs him.|$|E
500|$|He scored {{twice in}} 30 Conference games {{in his first}} season with Dover, and his {{performance}} earned him international selection, chosen for England's National Game XI {{for the first time in}} March 1999. He maintained the standard the following season; Dover's best player against rivals Rushden & Diamonds, he was eventually stretchered off with a damaged Achilles tendon after three opponents were booked for fouling him. Sidelined for a month due to injuries sustained in that match, Wormull returned to play 20 minutes as a substitute before joining Rushden for a fee of £50,000 later that same week. BBC Sport's 2000–01 Football Conference preview said that Dover would <b>miss</b> <b>him,</b> a view later echoed by then assistant manager Clive Walker, who described the 1999–2000 season as [...] "a year when we had players like Simon Wormull, Joe Dunne and Dave Clarke in the team. In all honesty, we weren't far away from having a side good enough to win the division. We needed perhaps two more players to compete at the top– but sadly we ended up selling Dunne and Wormull halfway through the season." ...|$|E
