Our study showed {{that the impact of}} the various environmental factors varied with the mode of gas transport and with the time scale considered. At non-emissive sites, governed by diffusive gas transport, soil gas composition was subject to a pronounced seasonal variation. A high extent of aeration, low methane concentrations and a high ratio of CO(2) to CH(4) were found across the entire depth of the soil cover during the warm and dry period, whereas in the cool and moist period aeration was less and landfill gas migrated further upward. Statistically, variation in soil gas composition was best explained by the variation in soil temperature. At locations dominated by advective gas transport and showing considerable emissions of methane, this pattern was far less pronounced with only little increase in the extent of aeration during drier periods. Here, the change of barometric pressure was found to impact soil gas composition. On a daily scale under constant conditions of temperature, gas transport at both types of locations was strongly impacted by the change in soil moisture. On an hourly scale, under constant conditions of temperature and <b>moisture,</b> gas <b>migration</b> was impacted most by the change in barometric pressure. It was shown that at diffusion-dominated sites complete methane oxidation was achieved even under adverse wintry conditions, whereas at hotspots, even under favorable dry and warm conditions, aerobic biological activity can be limited to the upper crust of the soil.

However lateritic soil has properties that are sensitive to moisture, and therefore a common method of treating the soil is by adding lime to it. However, {{it is difficult to}} mix lime with lateritic soil homogeneously in the field as lateritic soil is prone to agglomeration. Therefore, agglomeration size is important and in this study, soil agglomerates are tested for their California bearing ratio (CBR). Lime (Ca(OH) 2) is added to one of the groups of soil samples and the other group is left untreated. The results show that soil that has been treated with lime both hardens and softens, which is related to the agglomerate size, whereas the untreated soil just hardens. The agglomerate size that corresponds to the maximum CBR value is not consistent with that of maximum dry density. Moreover, the CBR values of soil that has been treated with lime are higher than those of the untreated soil for an agglomerate size that ranges from 0. 5 mm to 2 cm. Beyond this range, the addition of lime does not improve the lateritic soil. Compaction status and water intrusion are two important influential factors on CBR values.

Contamination of groundwater and soil raised the concern on the migration behaviour of LNAPL to aid in remediation research. Therefore, this research was conducted to study the migration behaviour of LNAPL in double porosity media of moisture content 27 %, 29 %, 31 % and 33 %. Photographic method {{was used to}} acquire images during the experiments. Image analysis technique was applied to acquire data of research using software Image-Pro Premier 9. 1. Based on the findings, LNAPL migrated at the fastest rate with the highest velocity in aggregated kaolin of 31 % moisture content due to larger inter-aggregate pore space when moisture content increased. Other than that, the area of LNAPL migration is the smallest in aggregated kaolin of 31 % moisture content due to higher residual saturation in the larger pore space. The final saturation of 31 % moisture content aggregated kaolin is the lowest due to the weaker capillary pressure in larger pore space. The mean intensity of the LNAPL migration is more uniform in aggregated kaolin of 31 % moisture content because disturbance on light intensity was greatly reduced with the shortest duration of migration. In conclusion, the effect of <b>moisture</b> content on <b>migration</b> behaviour of LNAPL in aggregated kaolin can be investigated using Light Reflection Method.

Polysilazane {{can be converted to}} silica by simple exposition to air or basic vapours and the properties of the synthesized film make this precursor a valuable choice to obtain solid, crack-free, highly adhesive and protective coatings. The coating is prepared starting from a Perhydropolysilazane precursor (20 % PHPS in n-butyl ether) that allows to achieve high-quality thin-films of silica at room temperature. The obtained films are uncoloured, even in absence of strong heat-treatment. Perhydropolysilazane (PHPS) is a polymer of [-SiH 2 -NH-SiH 2 -]n units. When deposited on a soda-lime microscope slide, it reacts with atmospheric moisture (Si-H and Si-NH bonds are hydrolysed to Si-O) and a silica film is produced. The conversion to silica is completed in about 2. 5 hours, using vapours of a 10 mol L- 1 ammonia solution. The reaction is promoted with the application of a weak heat-treatment (45 - 50 °C), achievable using as heater a common tungsten filament lamp. The reaction of PHPS with atmospheric <b>moisture</b> produces a <b>migration</b> phenomenon of the mobile ions from the soda-lime glass to the film (in particular sodium, calcium and magnesium).

Heat-generating high-level nuclear waste packages which will be emplaced in the partially saturated fractured tuffs at the potential high-level nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, if it becomes a high-level nuclear waste repository, will cause significant impacts on <b>moisture</b> distribution and <b>migration.</b> Liquid water, which occupies anywhere from 30 to 100 % of the porespace, will be vaporized as the temperature reaches the boiling temperature. Flowing primarily in fractures, the vapor will condense where it encounters cooler rock, generating mobile water. This water will flow under gravitational and capillary forces and may flow back to the vicinity of the emplaced waste where it may partially escape vaporization. Water flowing down (sub-) vertical fractures may migrate considerable distances through fractured rock that is at above-boiling temperatures; thus, flowing condensate may contact waste packages, and provide a pathway for the transport of water-soluble radionuclides downward to the saturated zone. Thermally-driven flow processes induced by repository heat may be as important or even more important for repository performance than natural infiltration. For a nominal thermal loading of 57 kW/acre, vaporization may generate an average equivalent percolation flux from condensate of 23. 1 mm/yr over 1, 000 years, and 5. 2 mm/yr over 10, 000 years.
