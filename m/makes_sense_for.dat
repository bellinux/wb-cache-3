For example, a distribution of points in the plane will typically have a mean and a mode, but {{the concept of}} median does not apply. The median makes sense {{when there is a}} linear order on the possible values. Generalizations of the concept of median to higher-dimensional spaces are the geometric median and the centerpoint.|$|E

In an experiment with Siamese fighting fish, two males were made to fight each other while being watched by a female, whom the males could also see. The winner and the loser of the fight were then, separately, given a choice between spending time next to the watching female or to a new female. The winner courted both females equally, but the loser spent more time next to the new female, avoiding the watcher female. In this species, females prefer males they have seen win a fight over males they have seen losing, and it therefore <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>for</b> a male to prefer a female that has never seen him {{as opposed to a}} female that has seen him lose.|$|E

He {{felt that there was}} no follow-up to the emotional disturbances suffered by the crew, but said that despite this the episode worked {{because of the presence of}} Lenard as Sarek. He said that [...] "they cunningly build up [...] respect for Picard throughout the episode so that the proposed solution to his problem doesn't seem too far-fetched, and the rapport between Lenard and Stewart is so immediate that you can believe a literal mind-meld <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>for</b> the characters. It's not a perfect episode in terms of its writing, but the acting sells it far better than it could've."

But if you think about it, Wellard was not a puppy when he arrived on Albert Square, so he would be over 100 in dog years by now. It <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>for</b> him to bow out of the show gracefully." [...] Raddings commented: [...] "I used to take Kyte on set everyday but I found the scenes when Wellard was put down too hard to watch so I asked someone else to take her to filming." [...] The scene in which Wellard was euthanised had to be re-edited, as Kyte could be seen breathing when supposedly dead. At the time of his death, Wellard had been in EastEnders for 14 years, making him one of the show's longest-running characters, and its longest-serving pet.|$|E
500|$|A {{graduate}} of Columbia University architecture school, Kosinski's knowledge of architecture was pivotal in conceptualizing the Tron: Legacy universe. His approach in cultivating a prototype {{was different from}} other film directors because, according to Kosinski, he came [...] "from a design point of view"; [...] "Some of my favorite directors come from outside of the film business, so that made my approach different from other directors, but a design background <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>for</b> a movie like this because the whole world {{has to be made}} from scratch." [...] Lisberger would later state that he left the sequel to a different production team because [...] "after thirty years I don’t want to compete with myself", and to showcase how the next generation dealt with the themes contained in Tron - [...] "If I brought my network in, it would be a little bit like one of those Clint Eastwood movies where all the old guys go to space." [...] Lisberger added that [...] "I dig this role of being the Obi-Wan or the Yoda on this film more than being the guy in the trenches", stating that unlike Kosinski his age was a hindering factor - [...] "I cannot work sixteen hours a day staring at twenty-five monitors for most of that time." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{including}} the Punisher {{specifically in the}} season, where he is introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Goddard felt television was the best fit for the character, as the writers are [...] "able to do things {{on the small screen}} that fit that character better than if we had to water him down for the movies." [...] Goddard stated that the season's approach to the characters and their actions would be to do what <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>for</b> the characters rather than [...] "pushing the boundary" [...] or looking to shock the audience, though he noted that this could still go in a more [...] "adult...darker, dirtier" [...] way due to the freedom of Netflix and the presence of characters such as the Punisher. Petrie stated that the writers hoped to [...] "stir the pot" [...] and [...] "get people to think" [...] with the inclusion of the Punisher and his lethal methods, adding, [...] "Taking lethal justice into your own hands in America in 2015 is tricky shit. We have not shied away from the rich complicated reality of Now. If you've got a gun and you're not the police you're going to incite strong feelings." [...] Ramirez added that Castle was not referred to as [...] "Punisher" [...] in the writer's room, similarly to Wilson Fisk not being called [...] "Kingpin" [...] for season one, as it allowed the writers to think [...] "about [...] as a man with a vendetta, who made an oath to his dead family. The more specific it got, the less it became about issues outside of Hell’s Kitchen or other things." [...] In the series, the moniker of [...] "The Punisher" [...] is given to Castle by the media due to his aggressive actions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} BioShock {{received some}} criticism from PlayStation 3 owners, {{who found the}} port from the native Windows and Xbox 360 developed by a separate studio, Digital Extremes, to be lackluster. To address this, Irrational Games has stated that the PlayStation 3 version of Infinite {{would not be a}} port, as that version is being developed in-house simultaneously with the Windows and Xbox 360 versions. In addition, the PlayStation 3 version of the game will support stereoscopic 3D. BioShock Infinite will support the PlayStation Move motion controller. Though some reports believed that a new Move controller would be produced for the game based on information from Sony, 2K Games debunked these stories, stating that no new hardware is being developed for the game. The North American PlayStation 3 version of the game will include a copy of the original BioShock. Levine has expressed interest in a Wii U version of Infinite in light of what abilities the touchscreen controller can offer, but contends that the decision to develop for that platform is [...] "really a discussion that the business people have and see if it <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>for</b> Nintendo, if it <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>for</b> Take Two".
