Despite his extraordinary qualities he was not depicted as a superhero or a god, but as a mortal <b>man.</b> <b>There</b> were opponents who surpassed him in courage and strength. He was occasionally capricious, short-tempered or cruel, but his predominant traits were honesty, loyalty and fundamental goodness.|$|E

Scully and Mulder visit the scene, with Mulder {{continuing}} {{to be very}} skeptical of any alien involvement. The Syndicate is shocked by the massacre. Mulder and Scully visit Cassandra again, who knew {{many of the people}} who died. They encounter Spender, who is upset about their visit with his mother. Krycek is met by Marita. When Krycek returns to the cell where Dmitri is held, he finds him gone, and the Well-Manicured <b>Man</b> <b>there</b> instead.|$|E
5|$|El Oriente resumed cargo {{service with}} the Morgan Line, and enjoyed a quiet career, {{typically}} sailing between New York and Galveston. One event of note occurred in February 1922 when El Oriente {{came upon the}} wreck of the schooner, Caldwell H. Colt, which had run aground on a reef near the Tortugas Light during a gale. When El Oriente came upon the hulk, only her captain remained alive, surviving without food or water for several days before his rescue. El Oriente continued on to Galveston and landed the <b>man</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E

40|$|Women {{substantially}} outnumber men {{among older}} Americans. Among the noninstitutionalized U. S. population age 65 - 74, for every 100 <b>men</b> <b>there</b> are 120 women. Among those age 75 - 84, for every 100 <b>men</b> <b>there</b> are nearly 150 women, and among those age 3 ̆e/= 85, for every 100 <b>men</b> <b>there</b> are nearly 220 women. Among {{the population of}} nursing home residents, the sex ratios are even more dramatic. For those age 65 - 74 who reside in U. S. nursing homes, for every 100 <b>men</b> <b>there</b> are 132 women. Among residents of nursing homes age 75 - 84, for every 100 <b>men</b> <b>there</b> are 246 women, and among those age 3 ̆e/= 85, for every 100 <b>men</b> <b>there</b> are 425 women. Unless gender-based differences in mortality narrow, the age-related demographic shifts that are occurring in the United States will remain overwhelmingly female. In considering any health-related issue in the geriatric patient population, a special focus on women is absolutely required. This is especially true with regard to pharmacotherapy in the geriatric population...|$|R

5|$|Nri people {{believed}} that the sun was the dwelling place of Anyanwu (Light) and Agbala (Fertility). Agbala was the collective spirit of all holy beings (human and nonhuman). Agbala was the perfect agent of Chukwu or Chineke (the Creator God) and chose its human and nonhuman agents only by their merit; it knew no politics. It transcended religion, culture and gender, and worked with the humble and the truthful. They believed Anyanwu, The Light, to be the symbol of human perfection that all must seek and Agbala was entrusted to lead <b>man</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E

Mary Rose, a lonely, thirty-year-old woman with the {{responsibility}} of looking after her father and brother, leaves Church on an April day in the 1940s. She goes to a Schrafft's outlet and becomes acquainted with a <b>man</b> <b>there</b> ordering food. When she sees him there the next day, the pair begin dating and eventually marry.

More than 100 captives were taken on an overland journey hundreds of miles north to the Caughnawaga mission village near Montreal, {{where most of the}} children who survived were adopted by the Mohawk people. Several adults were later redeemed or released in negotiated prisoner exchanges, including the minister, who tried for years without success to ransom his daughter. She became fully assimilated, marrying a Mohawk <b>man.</b> <b>There</b> was an active market in human trafficking of the captive colonists during these years, and communities raised funds to ransom their citizens from Indian captivity.|$|E
5|$|The central {{image of}} The Dry Salvages is {{water and the}} sea. The images {{are similar to the}} Odyssey but {{represent}} internal aspects. Humanity loses itself to technology and theories like evolution that separate mankind philosophically from the past. According to Eliot, within each <b>man</b> <b>there</b> is a connection to all of mankind. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{he will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation. Through Christ, we are able to overcome time unless we do not know him. Our corruption can be overcome and that we are able to join the eternal.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the myths}} {{of the earlier}} Ophite system are but lightly touched on, there is some trace of an {{acquaintance}} with them, as for example the myth that Adam was brought forth by the Earth spontaneously; he lay without breath, without motion, without stirring, like a statue; being made after {{the image of the}} First Man, through the agency of several Archons.
