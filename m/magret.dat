Fishing is popular in the region for the cuisine, sea fishing in the Bay of Biscay, trapping in the Garonne and stream fishing in the Pyrenees. The Pyrenees also support top quality lamb, such as the [...] "Agneau de Pauillac", as well as high quality sheep cheeses. Beef cattle in the region include the Blonde d'Aquitaine, Boeuf de Chalosse, Boeuf Gras de Bazas, and Garonnaise. High quality free-range chicken, turkey, pigeon, capon, goose and duck prevail in the region as well. Gascony and Périgord cuisines includes high quality patés, terrines, confits and <b>magrets.</b> This is one of the regions notable for its production of foie gras or fattened goose or duck liver. The cuisine of the region is often heavy and farm based. Armagnac is also from this region, as are high quality prunes from Agen.|$|R

50|$|LA 14 Bus. {{branches}} off of mainline LA 14 (West Summers Drive) {{just inside}} the Abbeville city limits and travels along Port Street. Just before reaching Bayou Vermilion, {{also known as the}} Vermilion River, LA 14 Bus. intersects US 167 (Park Avenue) at the latter's southern terminus. It then crosses a vertical lift bridge over the bayou and into downtown Abbeville. Over the next several blocks, the route forms the northern border of the city's Historic District, passing many of its historic landmarks and government buildings. After briefly traveling along Pere <b>Magret</b> Street, the highway separates into a one-way pair around Magdalen Square, located between Washington and Jefferson Streets. It then travels for one block along Concord Street before separating again to travel around the courthouse square with east and westbound traffic following Peace and Tivoli Streets, respectively. The courthouse square also marks an intersection with LA 82, which follows the one-way pair of St. Charles and State Streets north toward Lafayette. To the south, State Street carries two-way traffic for southbound LA 82 toward Perry and Intracoastal City. LA 14 Bus. proceeds along Charity Street and gains a center turning lane. After passing LA 338 (North John M. Hardy Drive), the highway widens to four lanes with center lane intact. Several blocks later, LA 14 Bus. rejoins the mainline route just to the west of Abbeville Chris Crusta Memorial Airport.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this trial}} was to {{study the effects of}} {{replacing}} yellow corn (C) with condensed tannin-free sorghum (S) during the finishing period (F period; age 53 to 79 d) and/or overfeeding period (O period; age 80 to 91 d) on the performance of overfed mule ducks. 192 ducks were divided into 4 groups (48 in each) differing in the cereal (yellow corn or sorghum) included in the diet given during the F and/or the O periods, using a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments : SS, SC, CS, CC. At the end of the O period, the birds were slaughtered after 10 h of fasting to measure foie gras and <b>magret</b> qualities. Mortality (1 %; P > 0. 05) and weight gain (2, 030 g; P > 0. 05) during the O period were similar in the 4 groups. At the end of the O period, birds overfed with sorghum had foie gras that was heavier (723 vs. 694 g in CS+SS vs. CC+SC, respectively; P 0. 05), but the foie gras was less yellow in birds overfed with sorghum (14. 84 vs. 26. 01 for b* in CS+SS vs. CC+SC, respectively; P 0. 05) but the color of the breast muscle and skin of <b>magret</b> was less yellow in birds overfed with sorghum compared with corn (12. 26 vs. 12. 92 and 13. 84 vs. 18. 30 in CS+SS vs. CC+SC, respectively; P < 0. 001). In conclusion, the replacement of yellow corn with sorghum during finishing and/or overfeeding is possible and useful in a mule duck foie gras production system because it increases foie gras weight without decreasing the weight of <b>magret.</b> However, it changes the quality of the products, mainly their color...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the presence of Campylobacter spp. during the slaughter processing of moulard ducks in Bulgaria. The prevalence of Campylobacter was determined from live bird to prepackaged carcasses and cuts for 4 ducks flocks.

After scalding and hot wax Campylobacter was isolated in 12, 5 % of the samples of skin surfaces. The breast meat with skin (<b>magret)</b> was contaminated in 7, 5 %. The chilled liver showed 12, 5 % positive samples. C. jejuni was the most commonly found species (81 %) followed by C. coli (19 %).

40|$|Respiratory {{infections are}} an acute {{challenge}} in critical care medicine, typically affecting the very old, very young, and chronically ill. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention es-timates that, in the United States, 1. 7 million hospital-acquired respiratory infections claim 90, 000 lives every year. This mortality rate is rising {{due to an}} increased number of immunosup-pressed patients, exposure to drug-resistant organ-isms, and a growing elderly population (Mizgerd, 2008; Esperatti et al., 2010; <b>Magret</b> et al., 2011; Venkatachalam et al., 2011). There is, therefore, an urgent need to find novel therapeutic targets, {{and to do so}} requires deeper understanding of the dis-ease’s underlying pathophysiology. Vertebrate animals rely on their diverse leuko-cyte populations to recognize and clear patho-gens that breach mucosal barriers (Medzhitov, 2007). Infection of the lung mobilizes lympho-cytes, granulocytes, and mononuclear phago-cytes. Among the lymphocytes, the innate-like B 1 B cells reside predominantly in serosal cavi-ties. In response to infection, serosal B 1 B cells relocate from either the pleural space or perito-neum and accumulate in either lung-draining lymph nodes or the spleen, respectively (Kawahara et al., 2003; Ha et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2007; Choi and Baumgarth, 2008; Moon et al., 2012). B 1 cells are major producers of natural IgM antibodies that protect the host by opsonizing pathogens and promoting complement receptor– mediated phagocytosis (Boes et al., 1998...|$|E
