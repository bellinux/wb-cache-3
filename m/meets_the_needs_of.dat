25|$|Traditionally, a {{flock of}} {{broilers}} consist of about 20,000 birds in a growout house that measures 400/500 feet long and 40/50 feet wide, thus providing about eight-tenths of a square foot per bird. The Council for Agricultural Science and Technology (CAST) states that the minimum space is one-half square foot per bird. More modern houses are often larger and contain more birds, but the floor space allotment still <b>meets</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the birds. The larger the bird is grown the fewer chickens are put in each house, to give the bigger bird more space per square foot.|$|E
500|$|The name {{sustainability}} {{is derived}} from the Latin sustinere (tenere, to hold; sub, under). Sustain can mean [...] "maintain", [...] "support", or [...] "endure". Since the 1980s sustainability has been used more in the sense of human sustainability on planet Earth and this has resulted in the most widely quoted definition of sustainability {{as a part of the}} concept sustainable development, that of the Brundtland Commission of the United Nations on March 20, 1987: [...] "sustainable development is development that <b>meets</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs".|$|E

500|$|These heavy-handed tactics drew outrage {{from the}} Labor Party, which {{challenged}} the Prime Minister to seek {{approval from the}} people. This Bruce did, and the elections of 1925 were Australia's first [...] "red scare" [...] election. He campaigned for industrial peace and an increased Commonwealth role in securing it, but also denounced [...] "foreign agitators" [...] and [...] "class war" [...] in appealing for law and order on the waterfront. He openly challenged pre-existing federal arrangements, stating {{on the campaign trail}} that Australia [...] "should now consider whether that great historic instrument, the Constitution, <b>meets</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> to-day {{in the light of the}} developments which have taken place". The campaign was a success and the Bruce government was easily re-elected, increasing by 11 seats its majority over a disheartened ALP, whose leader Matthew Charlton was in poor health.|$|E

[...] Laws mandating environmental impact assessment and requiring or encouraging development to minimize environmental impacts may be assessed against this principle.|$|E

2500|$|While a universally {{accepted}} definition of sustainability remains elusive, the Brundtland Commission of the United Nations defined sustainable development as development that <b>meets</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the present without compromising {{the ability of}} future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainability, the long-term maintenance of responsibility, requires the reconciliation of environmental, social equity and economic demands.

2500|$|Of Christianity, he said: [...] "it is not now true for me.... Every believing Christian is, I am sure, my spiritual brother... but if systemically I called {{myself a}} Christian I feel that to most men I should imply {{too much and}} so tell a lie". Of other world {{religions}}, he writes: [...] "All these religions are true for me as Canterbury Cathedral is a true thing and as a Swiss chalet is a true thing. There they are, and they have served a purpose, they have worked. Only they are not true for me to live in them.... They do not work for me". In The Fate of Homo Sapiens, published in 1939, Wells criticised almost all world religions and philosophies, stating [...] "there is no creed, no way of living {{left in the world}} at all, that really <b>meets</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the time… When we come to look at them coolly and dispassionately, all the main religions, patriotic, moral and customary systems in which human beings are sheltering today, appear to be in a state of jostling and mutually destructive movement, like the houses and palaces and other buildings of some vast, sprawling city overtaken by a landslide.|$|E
2500|$|GE's {{divestiture}} of NBC's entire radio {{division was}} the first cannon shot of what would play out in the national broadcast media, as each of the Big Three broadcast networks were soon acquired by other corporate entities. NBC was a particularly noteworthy case in that it {{was the first}} to be acquired – and was bought by a conglomerate outside the broadcast industry as GE otherwise primarily served as a manufacturing company. Prior to the GE acquisition, NBC operated its radio division partly out of tradition, and partly to meet its then-FCC-mandated requirement to distribute programming for the public good (the broadcast airwaves are owned by the public; as that broadcast spectrum is limited and only so many broadcast stations existed, this served as the basis for government regulation requiring broadcasters to provide certain content that <b>meets</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the public). Syndicators such as Westwood One were not subject to such rules as they did not own any stations. GE's divestiture of NBC Radio – known as [...] "America's First Network" [...] – in many ways marked the [...] "beginning of the end" [...] of the old era of regulated broadcasting and the ushering in of the new, largely unregulated industry that is present today.|$|E
