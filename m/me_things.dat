500|$|Lead singer Chester Bennington {{arrived late}} in the {{recording}} process of the album, having been chosen to replace Scott Weiland in the band Stone Temple Pilots, and then proceeded to record High Rise and tour with the band for most of 2013. When he eventually joined the band in the studio, {{he was surprised to}} find the band had reverted to their heavier rock-centric sound. Bennington stated in an interview with Kerrang!: [...] "Mike wrote tons while I was touring with Stone Temple Pilots last year. When I got home, there was a lot for me to catch up with, and he was playing <b>me</b> <b>things</b> and I was like, 'Dude, this is fucking awesome!' I was really surprised how heavy it was".|$|E
500|$|Elisabeth Moss {{said she}} was not told by Weiner that Peggy would be leaving SCDP [...] "until we were {{shooting}} episode 10, the one right before it. It was unusual that he didn't tell me. He usually tells me what's happening, pitches <b>me</b> <b>things</b> to ask me how they sound." [...] Moss' initial reaction [...] "was just one of feeling like {{there was really no}} other logical way to go for her. After everything that had happened for five years, she can't just keep butting her head up against that wall. [...] She's becoming her own person and she needs to have her own place not under Don." [...] Moss also said, [...] "I will thank [...] forever for not telling me. It would have made my life harder. I knew about Peggy's baby in season one. I fought against it, to play it as she was living it, feeling it, and not be in my head. Not knowing Peggy would quit allowed me to find it for myself, to really feel Peggy's growing frustration with Don all season." ...|$|E

And the first part of the reading was that this was the path that I was {{supposed}} to be on and that I was supposed to be a teacher and help people and – I thought she was nuts." [...] Speaking of the same encounter in a 2002 interview, Edward said, [...] "She told me I would one day become internationally known for my psychic abilities through lectures, books, radio and TV. I thought she was full of it until she started to tell <b>me</b> <b>things</b> no one in my life knew about... The details were unbelievable." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his latter years Leskov {{came under}} the {{influence}} of Leo Tolstoy, developing the concept of [...] "new Christianity" [...] he himself identified with the latter. [...] "I am in total harmony with him, and there's not a single person in the whole world who's more dear to <b>me.</b> <b>Things</b> I don't share with him never bother me; what I cherish is the general state of his soul, as it were, and his mind's frightful insightfulness," [...] Leskov wrote in another letter, to Vladimir Chertkov.|$|E
2500|$|Jung's {{assessment}} of Western religion arose both {{from his own}} experiences {{as well as from}} the psychotherapeutic work with his European clients. As a young man he had visions and dreams that were powerful and rich with meaning, yet he clung to Christianity. While he believed that God could [...] "do stupendous things to <b>me,</b> <b>things</b> of fire and unearthly light", he was profoundly disappointed by his first communion—in his words, [...] "nothing happened". He saw the same symptoms in his clients, namely, a fascination with the power of the unconscious, coupled with the inadequacy of Western religious symbols and rituals to represent this power. Summing up his analysis of the modern European situation he said: [...] "Our age wants to experience the psyche for itself ... knowledge, instead of faith." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gonzales enjoyed broad {{bipartisan}} support {{in connection with}} his nomination, including the support of former Democratic HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros and Colorado Democratic Senator Ken Salazar. [...] One writer noted, [...] "A senator from Pennsylvania said, 'I have always found him [...] to be completely forthright, brutally honest – in some cases telling <b>me</b> <b>things</b> I {{did not want to}} hear but always forthright, always honest, sincere, serious. [...] This is a serious man who takes the responsibilities that have been given to him as a great privilege and a great honor which he holds very carefully and gently in his hands.' [...] Said another senator, this one from Kentucky, 'Judge Gonzales is proof that in America, there are no artificial barriers to success. [...] A man or woman can climb to any height that his or her talents can take them. [...] For Judge Gonzales, that is a very high altitude indeed. [...] And luckily for his country, he is not quite finished climbing yet.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} arrival of her house guests, Joan had learned that her husband was still {{maintaining}} his small apartment and still involved with Ann Kurth. On the day following the argument, Hill took his son for a haircut, and during the drive, they went to his apartment to pick up some things; the boy talked with his mother about it when he arrived home. Joan invited her friend and neighbor Vann Maxwell over to discuss the matter, and when she arrived, announced an impromptu game of bridge with Settegast and Woolen in the music room. John Hill was listening to music {{at one end of the}} room while the women played cards at the other. Joan began loudly discussing her husband, then slipping into silence whenever he approached. She told the women that she was planning to consult a lawyer on Monday, and Maxwell became uneasy with the situation. She asked Joan to be quiet or she would leave. Joan then started writing notes to her friend, in which she repeated her intention to speak to a lawyer, and to take John out of her will. After a tense evening, Hill put on a romantic record and came over to stand behind his wife's chair. Settegast suggested the couple should dance, and they did. Afterwards they retired to bed. The next morning, Joan told Settegast that Hill had made her [...] "very happy" [...] the previous night. [...] "He told <b>me</b> <b>things</b> I've never heard from the man before in our whole married life. I think it's going to be all right between us from now on." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nick was not {{away from}} Walford for long. In 1991, he {{returned}} with a heroin addiction but Dot initially shunned him and ignored his pleas for help. It was only after discovering Charlie had died that Nick was her only family left and was determined to reform him. Discussing the storyline, Altman has said: [...] "I found the heroin addiction quite exhausting actually, because I grew a really thick beard and my hair was always really filthy. When I was shooting those scenes I met {{with a guy who}} was an addict, and he told <b>me</b> <b>things</b> that you go through, like you can’t relax when you’re trying to come off it. You can‘t sleep so you drink loads of alcohol to try and kill the pain. The clock barely seems to move. For me as an actor, they really let me go as far as I could on that. We had letters as well from people saying how it‘s put them off heroin for life, so I guess we did a good job." [...] As the plot unfolded, Dot tried to curtail Nick's addiction by locking him in his room and forcing him to go cold turkey with the help of Pete Beale. During this period, The Queen Victoria landlord Eddie Royle is murdered. The murder was the key storyline of the show during the autumn of 1991. The episode Eddie was murdered was written by Tony McHale, it finished with a cliffhanger featuring Clyde Tavernier in the gardens standing over Eddie's body and holding a knife, which Nick witnessed from his bedroom window. Nick tells the police what he saw, leading to Clyde going on the run with the help of Michelle Fowler. Joe Wallace eventually came forward, saying he saw Nick out on the square on the night of Eddie’s murder, having escaped his room and climbed down a drain pipe. Nick confesses to Dot that he was responsible but insists that it was an accident. Nick is subsequently arrested and charged with Eddie’s murder and he stands trial in January 1993. A week's worth of episodes were devoted to the trial, and were all written by Tony Jordan. To present the story of Nick's trial the programme-makers themselves had to review the evidence and watch the episodes leading up to the death of Eddie. In the end, although it was clear that Nick was responsible for stabbing Eddie, it was not clear that it was murder and the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. Altman summarised: [...] "Through having a really good defence and lying his head off once again, he got away with murder".|$|E
