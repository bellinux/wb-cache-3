50|$|In 1891, the British {{government}} {{established the}} Nyasaland Protectorate. In 1964 this land became the independent nation of the Republic of Malawi. The first known Baptist work in Nyasaland/Malawi {{was by the}} English Joseph Booth (1851-1932). Booth was responsible {{for all of the}} earliest Baptist work, {{as well as for the}} entrance of some other denominations into the area. He established a number of missions, but did not remain long with any of them. His work began with the Zambezi Industrial Mission in 1892, which he convinced British Baptists to help finance. He was also involved in the Nyaza Industrial Mission (1893) and the Baptist Industrial Mission(1895). In 1897, Booth took Yao tribesman John Chilembwe (ca.1871-1915) to America, where the National Baptists sponsored his education at the Virginia Theological Seminary and College at Lynchburg, Virginia. In 1900 Chilembwe returned to Africa under the banner of the National Baptist Convention and established the Providence Industrial Mission. After Chilembwe was killed on February 4, 1915 while leading an uprising against British authority, the government banned the Providence Mission. Today the nation of Malawi regards and honors Chilembwe as a martyr. His face appears on the 200 <b>Kwacha</b> (<b>Malawian</b> currency).|$|R
50|$|The Scout Association of Malaŵi {{raised about}} two million <b>Malawian</b> <b>kwacha</b> {{to prepare for}} the celebrations, and the {{upgrading}} work at Songani will cost 35 million kwacha, which will be footed by the UK Scout Association.|$|E
50|$|In 1970, Malawi {{issued a}} set of six numeral stamps to pay the Graduated Tax, and it was {{denominated}} in shillings and pence. A year later this was reissued in <b>Malawian</b> <b>kwacha,</b> and in 1973 there were some surcharged issues. These are not common {{but they do not}} command high prices.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the advice}} of the International Monetary Fund, in May 2012 Banda devalued the <b>Malawian</b> <b>kwacha,</b> {{something}} Mutharika had refused to do. The announcement of the kwacha's devaluation by 33 per cent against the United States dollar, an attempt to attract donor funding, prompted [...] "panic-buying" [...] in Malawian cities, the BBC News reported.|$|E
50|$|Nyasaland gained {{independence}} in 1964, taking the name Malawi. Chilembwe's likeness was {{seen on the}} obverse of all <b>Malawian</b> <b>kwacha</b> notes from 1997 until May 2012, when new notes were launched; the 500 Kwacha note still carries his portrait. Since December 2016, the newly introduced 2000 Kwacha note also carries his picture. John Chilembwe Day is observed annually on January 15 in Malawi.|$|E

The MP for Nkhata Bay South West is Silvester Kasambara, {{a member}} of the opposition. Kasambara caused a storm in Parliament in June 2008 when he pledged 10,000 <b>Malawian</b> <b>kwacha</b> to the Malawi {{national}} football team, after their 1-0 victory against Egypt, the African champions, in a FIFA World Cup 2010 qualifier.|$|E

50|$|Nkhata Bay's local {{football}} team are the Nkhata Bay Police; the team were renamed to Eagle Strikers and now play in Mzuzu. The team {{play in the}} TNM Super League. There is a ladies' {{football team}} in Nkhata Bay, and are called the Nkhata Bay United Sisters of Malawi. The club was founded in 2003. Netball is also played in Nkhata Bay. In June 2008, the champions of Nkhata Bay were Kawalazi, and received a prize of 30,000 <b>Malawian</b> <b>Kwacha.</b>|$|E
50|$|As District Commissioner for Lilongwe, he was {{in charge}} of the {{controversial}} order for the villagers to move off the land to make way for the construction of the proposed Raising Malawi Academy for Girls citing that it was government land reserved for development projects. He is quoted to have said 'You are lucky that Madonna has compensated you for your houses, gardens and trees.' According to Anjimile Oponyo who was going to be the director of Madonna's school, the singer paid the villagers more than 16 million <b>Malawian</b> <b>kwacha</b> (about $115,000) to compensate them for their houses.|$|E

50|$|However, the NFRA quickly {{incurred}} {{a debt of}} 1 billion <b>Malawian</b> <b>kwacha</b> (MK) due to {{the high}} interest rate of 56% at which it bought 165,000 metric tons of maize, according to the IMF. In 2001, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) recommended that the government sell the grain reserve because harvest had been ample in 2000. There seemed to be little use for such a large reserve, and the grain itself was rotting. The IMF’s recommendation also came {{as a result of}} a 2000 study requested by the European Commission that showed that only 30,000-60,000 metric tons of maize would be necessary to support the country in the case of a localized disaster. Maintaining such a large supply of maize is expensive, and the study recommended developing better importation strategies in the case of an unexpectedly large food crisis. NFRA followed the IMF’s advice and sold a majority of its reserve to Kenya and Mozambique decreasing the reserve from 165,000 metric tons of maize to 60,000. One of the popular opinions about the causes of the food crisis, according to a 2002 ActionAid report, is that the food crisis was in part caused by the IMF's advice to sell the grain reserve. However, the IMF and ActionAid recognize that the grain was old and expensive to store, and at the time, it made sense to advise NFRA to sell.|$|E
5000|$|The February 2014 Baker Tilly {{report found}} that a total of MK 13,671,396,751 (<b>Malawian</b> <b>Kwacha)</b> was misappropriated during the six-month period of 2013: More than MK 6 billion (45%) in Cashgate transactions; nearly MK 4 billion (29%) in {{payments}} with no supporting documents; and MK 3.6 billion (26%) in inflated procurement prices. The report concludes:“Overall, we have identified funding misappropriation and theft of GoM of Malawi funds. We have seen funds transferred between unrelated companies, individuals withdrawing funds from unconnected organizations and inflated prices paid to companies with limited or no trading history and very large cash withdrawals. We {{do not believe the}} receivers of these funds are therefore the ultimate beneficiary in all cases. However, in our opinion further specific detailed work is needed to support the Malawi Law Enforcement Agencies in investigating these matters across international jurisdictions. In this regard we encourage the international donors to continue to support oversight and thus to support ongoing investigations in order to ensure convictions and, if possible, reparations." [...]   Later in 2014, the British government provided the Auditor General of the Government of Malawi and the Malawi Law Enforcement Agencies with a second report that summarized 53 Cashgate case files. The total financial loss from Cashgate was found to be slightly higher than previously estimated (up to MK 15.5 billion). This report also detailed civil servants, companies, banks, Ministries and other individuals and organizations involved in illicit Cashgate transactions.|$|E
40|$|Education {{and health}} are both capital {{investments}} in national development, {{often viewed as}} independent factors on a country’s labor force supply and productivity. This study uses the 2010 – 2011 Third Integrated Household Survey in Malawi to propose an Education-enhanced Health Human Capital (EHHC) model where education influences labor force supply directly as well as indirectly through improvements in adult health. Relative to the Health Human Capital (HHC) model, the EHHC model better fits the available data, capturing the multiple effects of education. A national economic simulation of the 2013 age 13 cohort in Malawi confirms {{the importance of education}} as a tool for national development. Specifically, if the mean education of the age 13 cohort increased from the present national mean to the completion of secondary school, the total effects of education would lead to a predicted increase in annual tax revenue of 580 million <b>Malawian</b> <b>Kwacha...</b>|$|E
40|$|The Malawi Government was a British {{colony and}} after {{independence}} the local currency, the <b>Malawian</b> <b>Kwacha</b> (MWK) up to 1973 played {{to the same}} level with the British Pound (GBP). From that time, the authorities used many policies for proper management of the economy. These include and {{not limited to the}} devaluation, floatation and exchange rates adjustments with the view of creating conducive environment for economic growth. The authorities tried to manage the devaluation and floatation of the currency most importantly because its results have widespread effects on the whole economy. In a country like Malawi, where the exports are not at par with the imports and the equation being in favour of the latter it can be disastrous to leave these instruments uncontrolled. These things affect the country's relative price structure between tradable and non-tradable goods and later the overall level of domestic prices. The devaluation and floatation of the currency are among the most important tools in management of the economy and price stabilisation in most developing countries. currency devaluation; flotation; exchange rates; developing countries; Malawi; price stabilisation; economic management...|$|E
