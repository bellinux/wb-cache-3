40|$|People's <b>moods</b> can {{influence}} moral judgment. Such influences may arise because <b>moods</b> affect moral emotion, or because <b>moods</b> affect moral thought. The present study provides evidence that, {{at least in}} the footbridge dilemma, <b>moods</b> affect moral thought. The results of two experiments are reported in which, after induction of positive, negative, or neutral <b>moods</b> and presentation of the footbridge scenario, participants were asked one of two differentially framed closing questions. In the active frame, participants were asked whether they would be active and push the man, making thoughts about pushing accessible; in the passive frame, they were asked whether they would be passive and not push the man, making thoughts about not pushing accessible. The results show that affective influences on moral judgment depended on participants' decision frame. Compared to neutral <b>moods,</b> positive <b>moods</b> induced utilitarian responding - i. e., deciding to push - in the active decision frame, but induced nonutilitarian responding - i. e., deciding to not push - in the passive decision frame; in negative <b>moods,</b> exactly the opposite picture arose. The results suggest that people's <b>moods</b> affect moral judgment by conferring value on moral thought. Positive <b>moods</b> promote and negative <b>moods</b> inhibit accessible thoughts...|$|R

40|$|In Being and Time {{as well as}} in {{his later}} writings, Heidegger comes to {{distinguish}} between fundamental <b>moods</b> and everyday or inauthentic <b>moods.</b> He also claims that phenomenology, rather than psychology, is the appropriate method for examining <b>moods.</b> This article employs a schematic approach to investigate a phenomenology of fundamental <b>moods</b> in terms of its possibilities and limits. Since, in Being and Time, the distinction between fundamental <b>moods</b> and ordinary <b>moods</b> is tied to the division between authenticity and inauthenticity, the latter concepts need to be addressed first. Guided by Klaus Held's article 'Fundamental <b>Moods</b> and Heidegger's Critique of Contemporary Culture', {{the second part of the}} article argues that Heidegger's phenomenology of <b>moods</b> is indeed one-sided, favouring anxiety at the expense of awe. Finally, I argue that, contrary to Held's claims, this one-sidedness cannot be amended by the means one finds in Heidegger's analyses.

This {{study investigated the}} nature of autobiographical memories that facilitate improvement of negative <b>moods.</b> More specifically, it examined the relations between participants' subjective <b>moods</b> and the three natures of recalled memories (the current positivity, the past positivity, and the importance). After 67 participants were induced either negative or neutral <b>moods,</b> {{they were asked to}} recall five positive experiences and to rate their affective states. Results indicated that the more important memories participants recalled, the more positive <b>moods</b> they reported after recollection, and that these effects of the importance of autobiographical memories were observed in both negative and neutral <b>moods.</b> In contrast, neither the current positivity of memories nor the past positivity of memories significantly influenced participant's <b>moods</b> in both negative and neutral <b>moods.</b> The mechanism by which the importance of autobiographical memory affects <b>moods</b> was discussed...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{many studies}} said that <b>moods</b> had effects on {{information}} processing.

Third, positive <b>moods</b> would last longer in conditions as mentioned above. This study examined how attitude accessibility and certainty of negative <b>moods</b> influence attitudes and behaviors. As a result, the stronger accessibility was, the higher assessments for brands and buying behaviors were on negative <b>moods</b> of certainty. This was supposed that negative events were difficult to be activated from memory because those causes were certain, people used automatic processing based on accessibility. On the other hand, the stronger accessibility was, the lower assessments were on negative <b>moods</b> of uncertainty.

5|$|For the {{expression}} of <b>mood,</b> English uses a number of modal auxiliaries, such as can, may, will, shall and the past tense forms could, might, would, should. There is also a subjunctive and an imperative <b>mood,</b> both based on the plain form of the verb (i.e. without the third person singular -s), and which is used in subordinate clauses (e.g. subjunctive: It is important that he run every day; imperative Run!).|$|E

5|$|Greenlandic verbs inflect for {{agreement}} with agent and patient, for <b>mood</b> and for voice. There are eight moods, of which four {{are used in}} independent clauses and four in subordinate clauses. The four independent moods are: indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative. The four dependent moods are causative, conditional, contemporative, and participial. Verbal roots can take transitive, intransitive or negative inflections, so that all eight <b>mood</b> suffixes have these three forms. The inflectional system is further {{complicated by the fact}} that transitive suffixes encode both agent and patient in a single morpheme, requiring up to 48 different suffixes to cover all possible combinations of agent and patient for each of the eight transitive paradigms. As some moods do not have forms for all persons (imperative only has 2nd person, optative only 1st and 3rd person, participial <b>mood</b> has no 4th person and contemporative has no 3rd person), the total number of verbal inflectional suffixes is about 318.|$|E

40|$|Some people recall more {{positive}} memories in negative <b>moods</b> than in neutral <b>moods,</b> {{which is called}} mood-incongruent effect. Although previous research suggested that structure of self-knowledge influences mood-incongruent effect (Sakaki, 2004), {{it is possible that}} motivation for mood-regulation mediates relation between structure of self-knowledge and mood-incongruent effect. The present study aimed at exploring this possibility by using self-complexity. In Study 1, participants with higher self-complexity, whose self-knowledge has more self-aspects with a higher level of differentiation, recalled {{more positive}} memories in negative <b>moods</b> (compared to neutral <b>moods)</b> than participants with lower self-complexity, whose self-knowledge has a fewer self-aspects with larger overlap. Study 1 also revealed that these effects hold even when the motivation for mood-regulation was partialed out. Study 2 examined mood-incongruent effect under positive <b>moods,</b> in which participants are unlikely motivated to alter their <b>moods,</b> and it was found that participants with higher self-complexity recalled more negative memories in positive <b>moods</b> (compared to neutral <b>moods)</b> than participants with lower self-complexity...|$|R

To help conversation between humans, we believe that the robots should have two abilities: estimate dialogue <b>moods</b> and behave suitably. In this paper, we propose dialogue <b>moods</b> estimation model. This paper, as the first step, focused on dialogues between two persons and construct estimation model for the dialogue <b>moods</b> observed by the third party. Because we believed that the dialogue <b>moods</b> are influenced by utterance time, which is extracted easily, the utterance intervals features are used to estimate the dialogue <b>moods,</b> for example, both solitary utterance intervals of leading speakers and following speakers, simultaneous utterance intervals, and silent intervals between two speakers. Using these utterance intervals features, we constructed the estimation model for dialogue <b>moods</b> by using Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes. Through the estimation experiment, we confirmed the availability of the estimation model for dialogue <b>moods,</b> in particular ``excitement,'' ``seriousness,'' and ``closeness,'' and the effective utterance intervals features for estimating dialogue <b>moods.</b> From the experimental results, it is suggested that the proposed model is effective for estimating dialogue <b>moods...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesAlthough many {{diagnosed}} with Bipolar Disorder (BD) choose {{to manage their}} <b>moods</b> without medication at some point, their experiences of doing so are not well understood. This paper aims to explore the processes by which people manage bipolar <b>moods</b> without medication. MethodsTen people {{diagnosed with}} BD who do not use medication were interviewed. Analysing their accounts using grounded theory methods led to developing a model of how they perceive the processes involved in managing <b>moods</b> without medication. ResultsParticipants engaged in repeated evaluative processes around their strategies for managing <b>moods.</b> Some participants decided not to influence elevated <b>moods</b> due to their perceived advantages. Participants׳ intentions and actions were influenced by their perceptions of themselves and by the meanings they attached to bipolar <b>moods,</b> which were in turn influenced by feedback from others. ConclusionsThe complexity of the processes described by participants suggests that traditional models of explaining non-adherence may over-simplify some individuals׳ experiences. Future research could focus on identifying factors predictive of successful attempts to manage <b>moods</b> without medication. Professionals should place more emphasis on non-medication approaches {{in order to increase}} engagement with people who do not use medication. This may involve focussing on individual׳s longer-term goals rather than on modifying <b>moods</b> in shorter-term.
