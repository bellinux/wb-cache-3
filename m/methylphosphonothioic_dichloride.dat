40|$|The reagent {{obtained}} in situ by treating <b>methylphosphonothioic</b> <b>dichloride</b> with 1 -hydroxy- 6 -trifluoromethylbenzotriazole {{could be used}} for the introduction of methylphosphonothioate linkages. The individual diastereomers of the protected dimer d-Tp(S,Me) A were applied in the synthesis of the chiral pure (R or S) hexamers d-[CpCpTp(S,Me) ApGpG]. The reagent showed also to be very effective for the preparation of the 3 ', 5 '-cyclic methylphosphonothioate of uridine...|$|E
