5|$|At Shimer, the {{professor}} is a facilitator, a guide on the side, not a sage {{on the stage}} – encouraging each student {{to contribute to the}} intellectual light being kindled in every class. Each student is expected to question and comment upon the text, to respond to one other’s insights, actively taking part in every discussion.... Students know their insights matter; they have something to offer to their peers, and {{to the life of the}} text being discussed. Some students are more exuberant than others, some would rather talk than listen; others <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> shy. The professor/facilitator must make sure that each student has a chance to shine, that each can feel confident, each can have the courage to ask what they think might be a stupid question. What are feared to be stupid questions are often the most provocative ones.|$|E
25|$|The {{inability}} {{to relate to}} others {{is also known as}} emotional detachment. Emotional detachment makes it difficult for an individual to empathize with others or to share their own feelings. An emotionally detached person may try to rationalize or apply logic to a situation to which there is no logical explanation. These individuals tend to stress the importance of their independence and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> neurotic. Oftentimes, the {{inability to}} relate to others stems from a traumatic event.|$|E

He possessed insight, public spirit, and courage. He proved his expertise on military and foreign affairs during his campaigns against the Persians, Avars and Slavs, and also during peace negotiations with Khosrau II. His administrative reforms reveal him as a farsighted statesman, all the more since they outlasted his death by far and were the basis for the introduction of such themes as military districts.|$|E

25|$|The {{maximum age}} of the Unkar Group is also {{established}} by uranium-lead (U-Pb) dating of zircons from an ash bed from the Bass Formation in the basal Unkar Group of 1254 Ma near river Mile 78 (List of Colorado River rapids and features). The dating of detrital zircons from the Bass Formation have yielded dates of about 1200 Ma. These dates suggest that the 1254 Ma age <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too old. However, these zircons likely underwent some lead loss, and, as a result these apparent dates are younger than their actual ages. As a result, the 1254 Ma dates remain the best estimate for the age of initial deposition of the Unkar Group.|$|E
25|$|Adults have a pale buff head, {{changeable}} {{between a}} more brownish {{and an almost}} white hue according to feather wear and individual variation. The broad black face mask stretches across the neck as a narrow collar, bordered with white. On the crown, the feather shafts are dark, producing a somewhat streaked effect. The upper wings and back are blackish brown. The uppertail coverts are whitish buff again, and the rectrices are barred black and whitish, ending in white. The underside is uniformly pale buff; there <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of dark speckling on the thighs, however. The underside of the wing is pale rufous-buff, sometimes with some dark spotting on the underwing coverts. The tips of the primary remiges are barred with pale grey below, their bases are quite rufous. The iris is dark brown, the bill is black with a pale yellow cere; the feet are also pale yellow.|$|E

This film resonates in the memory, insistently and inspiredly." [...] Simon also discusses the cinematography, arguing that Călin Ghibu's use of lighting manages to convey the [...] "almost unearthly beauty at sunset", which helps viewers understand why Scott Thompson's character uses Mount Fuji as her preferred metaphor for the place. Of this aspect, James notes: [...] "Like its heroine, the film's serene and beautiful appearance masks a powerful conscience." ...|$|E

[...] The British film critic Jonathan Ross said: [...] "Everything about Battlefield Earth sucks. Everything. The over-the-top music, the unbelievable sets, the terrible dialogue, the hammy acting, the lousy special effects, the beginning, the middle and especially the end." [...] The Hollywood Reporter summarized the film as being [...] "a flat-out mess, by golly, with massive narrative sinkholes, leading to moments of outstanding disbelief in the muddled writing and shockingly chaotic mise en scène that's accompanied by ear-pummeling sound and bombastic music." ...|$|E

Nevertheless, producer Cates issued a statement defending the host saying, [...] "Chris' comments are meant to be humorous digs at a show that some people, obviously including Chris himself, think <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too stuffy." [...] Furthermore, Wolk dismissed any controversy regarding Rock's comments and that Drudge exaggerated the host's comments. GLAAD Executive Director Joan Garry also issue a statement in light of the controversy stating, [...] "Chris Rock isn't making fun of gays [...] he's poking fun at the Oscars." [...] Rock appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno the Monday before the ceremony to clarify his comments. When Leno asked about the statement, Rock replied [...] "I did not say that.

[...] Billboard wrote a positive review, stating that [...] "...while it all <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> unpredictable, and may be a longshot to do much in the U.S. market, it is an excellent LP." [...] The album was also placed in Circus magazine's section for [...] "Picks of the Month". Cynthia Dagnal of Rolling Stone wrote an article on Eno, calling the album [...] "a very compelling experiment in controlled chaos and by his own self-dictated standards a near success."

500|$|Various {{aspects of}} {{gameplay}} garnered a mixed reception from critics, though the game's control scheme {{received the most}} criticism. A reviewer from GamePro criticized the control configuration and felt that the game was a mediocre example of a pinball game, but admitted {{that it had a}} similar feel to previous Sonic the Hedgehog titles. Jeuxvideo.com's reviewer enjoyed how Sonic himself acted as a pinball, but noticed that the controls were less precise and responsive when compared to other platformers. Whitehead asserted that the game's controls were [...] "muddled by the half-and-half approach" [...] and criticized its [...] "clunky" [...] game engine, saying that the game's control scheme ruined the pinball environments. Thomas stated [...] "there are aspects of the control that could have been tighter, and its difficulty level <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too extreme for new players." [...] Damien McFarren from NintendoLife said that the game comes across as both a poor platformer and a poor pinball game due to its unconvincing ball physics and frustrating platform elements. Bob Strauss of Entertainment Weekly felt the game initially boasted a [...] "terrific" [...] concept but had an ultimately flawed execution—saying that Sonic, acting as a pinball, often moved like a [...] "leaden marble". Rich Leadbetter from Mean Machines also expressed concern over the game's lack of replay value, saying that despite its addictive gameplay the game's four levels were not enough, especially given its high price.|$|E

2500|$|The first Russian {{produced}} four-wheel-drive vehicle, also in {{part for}} civilian use, was the GAZ-61, developed in the Soviet Union in 1938.

Soviet civilian life did not allow the proliferation of civilian products such as the Jeep in North America, but through the 1960s the technology of Soviet 4×4 vehicles stayed on par with British, German, and American models, even exceeding it in some aspects, and for military purposes just as actively developed, produced and used.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1690s, Stradivari made a {{pronounced}} departure from this earlier style of instrument-making, changing two {{key elements of}} his instruments. First, he began to make violins with a larger pattern than previous instruments; these larger violins usually are known as [...] "Long Strads". He also switched to using a darker, richer varnish, {{as opposed to a}} yellower varnish similar to that used by Amati. He continued to use this pattern until 1698, with few exceptions. After 1698, he abandoned the Long Strad model and returned to a slightly shorter model, which he used until his death. The period from 1700 until the 1720s is often termed the [...] "golden period" [...] of his production. Instruments made during this time are usually considered of a higher quality than his earlier instruments. Late-period instruments made from the late 1720s until his death in 1737 show signs of Stradivari's advancing age. These late instruments <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> less beautiful than the Golden Period instruments, but many nonetheless possess a fine tone. Heavier and looser craftmanship of the late Stradivari output {{can be seen in the}} 1734 'Habeneck'.|$|E

Reviewer Wolfgang Gruener noted that the first builds of Chrome 9 have now doubled in size between Chrome 3 and Chrome 9 to a compressed download of 28.2 MB, calling it [...] "notably more bloated". Gruener also criticized the seemingly arbitrary numbering breaks between major versions, saying, [...] "even by more progressive standards, the version numbering <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> excessive.

Stable releases of Chrome and Chromium were version 9.0.597.84 and included features such as Instant Search which allows the URL bar to act through Google Instant when Google is the default search.
