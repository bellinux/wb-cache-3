40|$|Due to the {{enhanced}} demands for woody biomass, {{it is increasingly}} relevant to assess possibilities to harvest forest harvest residues in addition to logs. Here, eight strategies for whole tree harvesting from clear-cuts and early thinnings of pine (Pinus nigra) stands in northern Belgium are evaluated. A detailed cost analysis using the <b>machine</b> <b>rate</b> method was conducted along with scenario and sensitivity analyses of the variables affecting the harvesting cost. On average, we found a much higher revenue for logs than for wood chips from forest harvest residues. In clear-cuts, a mobile chipper was more profitable than a road-side chipper. In early thinnings, on the other hand, the harvesting cost of logs was higher than for clear-cuts. However, the revenue remained higher than for chips, making the separate harvesting of logs and chips more cost-effective than chipping whole trees. In the latter case, an excavator, a forwarder and a road-side chipper were more cost-effective than a harvester, a tractor with trailer and a mobile chipper, respectively. Harvest of additional woody biomass required limited energy input compared to processing and intercontinental transport of wood pellets.

40|$|Micro {{ultrasonic}} machining, µUSM, is a non-thermal, nonchemical and non-electrical {{process that}} is especially suitable for hard, brittle, and inert insulators such as ceramics. Typically, the µUSM process is capable of <b>machining</b> <b>rates</b> ≥ 300 nm/sec; the resulting surface roughness is Sa≥ 250 nm. There is a compelling need to extend this micromachining approach in precision and resolution {{for a variety of}} MEMS, such as for the high resolution trimming of timing references. However, a number of challenges must be addressed including the development of appropriate equipment, methodology of tool design and fabrication, and optimization of machining parameters. The research described in this thesis addresses the challenges for high resolution micro ultrasonic machining (HR-µUSM), providing high resolution and high surface quality, and precise control of <b>machining</b> <b>rates.</b> Experimental results demonstrate that the HR-µUSM process achieves <b>machining</b> <b>rates</b> as low as 10 nm/sec averaged over the first minute of machining of fused silica substrates. This corresponds to a mass removal rate of ≈ 20 ng/min. The average surface roughness, Sa, achieved is as low as 30 nm, which is an order of magnitude lower than conventional µUSM. The process is used to demonstrate trimming of hemispherical 3 -D shells made of fused silica. Additionally, this thesis addresses a challenge of slurry precipitation or settling during 3 -D machining using µUSM, which drastically reduces the <b>machining</b> <b>rates</b> to negligible values. A mode of μUSM is developed in which the workpiece is vibrated and not the tool. Experimental evaluations of this process result in <b>machining</b> <b>rates</b> ranging typically from 5 – 50 nm/sec for vibration levels ranging from 1 – 8 μm. The workpiece vibration agitated the abrasive particles, alleviating slurry settling. Finally, this thesis explores the resolution limit of µUSM using lithographically patterned silicon micromachined tools. The use of lithography enables the batch mode transfer of complex patterns, greatly enhancing the throughput of the process. Silicon microstructures with high resolution(≤ 10 µm) and high aspect ratio(≥ 20 : 1) can be readily made using deep reactive ion etching (DRIE).

The power plant has specific raw material handling requirements. Output from a 3 -knife chipper, a tub grinder, and a horizontal grinder was considered. None of the samples from these machines met the specifications needed. A horizontal grinder was modified to replace the teeth on the drum with chipping blades in order to process whole trees into biomass chips that met the power plant’s size specification. The study was installed on the Shoal Creek Ranger District, National Forests in Alabama, near Heflin, AL.

The statistical analysis of these data pointed at an economic life {{in the vicinity of}} 18, 000 h for both harvesters and forwarders, which confirms previous assumptions. The average annual use for the machines in the database is 1424 and 1581 h year - 1, respectively for the harvesters and the forwarders. Nordic users achieve a higher annual use than central European users, and the difference is statistically significant. Nevertheless, the average annual use recorded for both groups falls below the levels commonly adopted in current estimates, which may therefore represent ideal reference figures rather than actual averages. Residual value is strongly related to machine age, and the authors calculated some simple functions for estimating it. The study points at a better retention of the original value, compared to the figures reported in previous literature.

Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Forestry, 2011 Two different methods of fire hazard reduction were selected for study {{in order to understand}} the productivity and costs associated with each. These methods included mechanical mastication of fuels and an integrated harvesting system used for fuel reduction thinning. Understanding of these methods will aid in the selection of machine type or system combination appropriate to the treatment area. Work-study and timestudy methods coupled with standard <b>machine</b> <b>rate</b> calculations were used to evaluate cost and productivity. Systematic random sampling was determined to be the preferred method of work sampling for mastication due to its accuracy and ease of implementation. Mastication treatment cost was determined to be 326. 10 /ac or 29. 51 /ton of fuel and was highly sensitive to the machine production rate. Integrated harvesting costs were 0. 42 /ft 3 and 52. 41 /BDT (bone dry ton).

40|$|Two {{tests were}} {{conducted}} with {{a new model of}} mini-forwarder, specifically designed for thinning operations. The tested machine resembles a conventional industrial forwarder, with tandem bogies and central articulation, but is much smaller and lighter. The machine was tested on forest plantations established on ex-farm land: such plantations offer favorable and homogeneous work conditions, which allowed reasonably accurate productivity figures to be obtained with {{a relatively small number of}} observation hours (about 10. 5 h). Despite the relative inexperience of the driver, the tests indicated a productivity of between 3. 1 and 3. 8 m 3 per scheduled machine hour (SMH) over an extraction distance of about 400 m. Extraction costs ranged from 12. 4 to 15. 1 € m- 3 at the calculated <b>machine</b> <b>rate</b> of 47. 6 € h- 1. Compared to older models derived from recreation vehicles or tracked wheelbarrows, the machine tested in this study offers a better performance and a much more comfortable workplace, with the operator sitting inside an enclosed and insulated cab. Fitted with four bogies and provided with a much longer wheelbase, the new forwarder is likely to be safer than tracked machines when surmounting obstacles, and it certainly offers a much smoother ride to the operator. Nevertheless, the tested machine is still much narrower than industrial forwarders and does not enjoy the same lateral stability. Hence, the machine is ideal for sneaking between trees and climbing over obstacles, but once on a slope it must be driven straight along the grade and never across it, unless with much caution. Like all hydrostatically driven vehicles, the tested mini-forwarder is not suited to long-distance extraction (1 km) : if run at high speed for too long, its hydrostatic transmission tends to overheat, forcing the operator to make frequent stops. © 2010 The Japanese Forest Society and Springer...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} analysis of transportable biomass conversion facility design to evaluate the conceptual and economic viability of a mobile and modular biomass conversion supply chain in the Pacific Northwest, USA. The main goal of this work {{is to develop a}} decision support system to more effectively and sustainably use residual biomass from commercial harvesting operations that are currently piled and burned as part of site preparation. To complete this research a comprehensive biomass supply chain landscape characterization, modeling and optimization study was completed to provide {{an analysis of}} transportable biomass conversion facility design and evaluate its potential economic viability from strategic, tactical and regional perspectives. The long-term goal of this research is to help enable a sustainable marketplace for forest harvest residuals to effectively utilize this waste material and support regional economies. To complete this research the following components were developed: a comprehensive supply chain characterization, a conversion technology and <b>machine</b> <b>rate</b> model, a plant facility costing model, regional spatial and biomass availability data and two economic optimization models. My specific contribution was to examine a spectrum of economic tradeoffs and supply chain considerations including move frequency, logistics, energy costs, moisture content, product viability considerations and regional context related to the implementation of transportable biomass conversion facilities that had previously not been evaluated. Transportable facilities ranging from 15, 000 - 50, 000 BDT/year scale for three products (biochar, briquettes, torrefied wood) within Oregon, California and Washington are reviewed. The work considers various supply chain pathways including supply options at landings (burn, grind, chip, bale), centralized landings (grind/chip), biomass conversion facilities (biochar, briquettes, torrefied wood) and delivery to final market. Within the body of this work, I present three papers where I systematically evaluate the implications of transportable facility design (scale, movement, biomass availability), the economic impacts on the supply chain (logistics, moisture content, product pricing, product production), and the intra-regional variations associated with the system under unique market, product, transportation and energy environments. This analysis was done in an effort to better understand the impacts of transportable conversion facilities and their potential economic viability. A mixed integer linear programming model was developed to characterize, evaluate and optimize biomass collection, extraction, logistics and facility placement over a landscape from a strategic level to evaluate the mobility concept over a five year time horizon. This model was then used to evaluate facility economics of scale, optimal movement frequency, and sensitivity to biomass availability within a Lakeview, Oregon case study facility producing biochar. Results indicated significant advantages with larger scale operations with grid-connected power and limited mobility being preferable to a more mobile facility. Results depend greatly on the landscape, assumed harvest schedule, biomass composition and governing biomass plant assumptions. A tactical-level biomass supply chain model is also developed to evaluate and characterize the temporal, logistics and multi-product aspects of the proposed transportable facility design. The model solves a multi-period, multi-commodity, multi-echelon combinatorial problem to maximize net present value using a genetic algorithm. This model was used to evaluate competing biomass logistical systems, the impacts of moisture content on costs (transportation and drying) for a single facility as well as to evaluate the impacts of product conversion efficiencies, product pricing and co-product production economics for six plant configurations within the Lakeview, Oregon case study. Results generally indicated that system viability is largely dependent on market pricing, plant assumptions and conversion estimates while processing and transportation logistics are smaller, but important contributors for small scale biomass conversion faculty design configurations. Moisture content management was found to be an important factor contributing to conversion drying cost with co-generation of products benefiting from production and thermal efficiencies. It was also found that, given the revenue estimates, biochar was the most probable candidate for commercial success pending on market conditions. Finally, a regional study was completed to extend the transportable facility economic analysis to five sites (Lakeview, Oakridge, Warm Springs, Quincy, Port Angeles) encompassing three states over a five year time horizon with three product configurations and an assumed 50, 000 BDT/Year feedstock capacity. This research analyzes the effects of regional differences (logistics, biomass quality and quantity, energy rates, log markets) within the transportable system design to gauge potential economic viability and its sensitivities to fuel, energy and transportation distances. Overall, results indicate that there is a fairly small inter-regional product costing variation (< 10...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the research of}} possibilities of forwarding timber in an efficient and environmentally friendly way, under conditions of limited bearing capacity of gley soils of Croatian lowland forests due to their increased moisture all the year round. Reduced soil bearing capacity causes restricted mobility and decreases the forwarder productivity, and also increases the level of damage caused to forest soil, reflected in its compaction and rutting (Fig. 1). In lowland even-aged forests of Croatia, main felling is mostly carried out based on wood cutting and processing by chain saws and forwarding of timber, processed by cut-to-length method, by six-wheel forwarders, usually not equipped with semitracks on rear wheels of bogie axle (Fig. 1). The analysis was carried out on {{the example of a}} medium-weight six-wheel forwarder Valmet 840. 2 (nominal load capacity of 12 t, whose dimensions and load distribution of empty vehicle are shown in Fig. 4), and this analysis involved as follows: 1) the effect of load reduction on forwarder efficiency, 2) forwarder environmental soundness under conditions of limited soil strength based on nominal ground pressure (Mellgren 1980) of front and rear wheels of the vehicle depending on the mass of loaded timber, vehicle with narrower (600 mm) and wider (710 mm) tires, or with tracks on wheels of the rear (bogie) axle. The limit value of environmental soundness would be the allowed ground pressure of limited bearing capacity < 60 kPa (Owende et al. 2002). The effect of load reduction (4 t, 8 t with respect to 12 t of the vehicle nominal load capacity) on forwarder efficiency with respect to the distance of timber forwarding, is expressed according to the multicriteria calculation model of productivity of these vehicles (Stankić 2010), which takes into account: 1) forwarder class 2) soil strength, 3) use of tracks, 4) felling density, 5) volume of the average felling tree and 6) distance of timber forwarding. The unit cost of timber forwarding was calculated according to <b>machine</b> <b>rate</b> made by the company »Hrvatske šume» d. o. o Zagreb for the forwarder Valmet 840. 2 (433. 19 kn/h). For calculating the nominal ground pressure (Fig. 3), a theoretical model of axle load distribution was used, the case of vehicle at standstill on level ground, depending on mass and length of loaded logs in the bunk area of the forwarder (Poršinsky and Horvat 2005). The analysis of axle load distribution was based on an average length of logs (4 m) made by cut-to-length method {{in the area of the}} Croatian lowland forests, and the mass of 1800 kg of a pair of semitracks. The wheel load assumed even load distribution of axle load by pertaining wheels. The contact area between wheels (tracks) and soil was calculated according to Mellgren (1980), for narrower (front – 600 / 65 - 34, rear – 600 / 55 - 26. 5) and wider (front – 710 / 55 - 34, rear – 710 / 45 - 26. 5) tires recommended by the manufacturer of forwarder. The analysis of the forwarder environmental soundness was based on: 1) values of nominal ground pressure of front and rear wheels of the vehicle depending on the mass of loaded timber, and use of narrower and wider tires, i. e. or use of tracks, and 2) the upper limit value of the allowed ground pressure (< 60 kPa) of limited bearing capacity (class 3 – Fig. 2), which prevails at the time of main felling in the Croatian lowland forests. The results of efficiency analysis of timber forwarding (Fig. 5) showed that the reduction of load under conditions of limited bearing capacity of gley soils, as a measure for providing vehicle mobility as well as for diminishing the level of damage caused to forest soil, is highly unacceptable due to the decrease of productivity and increase of unit costs. The analysis of nominal ground pressure (Fig. 7) under wheels of the front axle and wheels (tracks) of the rear axle, showed that under conditions of limited soil bearing capacity: 1) the forwarder nominal load capacity may be used and that efficient timber forwarding may be performed, 2) the environmental soundness can be provided by the application of four-axle (eight-wheel) forwarders equipped with wider tires and half-tracks on wheels of front and rear bogie axle of the vehicle. These results should be used as guidelines for purchasing forwarders, and such approach would provide in future ecoefficient timber forwarding under conditions of limited bearing capacity of gley soils in main felling sites of lowland forests...|$|E

Analiza je provedena na primjeru srednje teškoga šestokotačnoga forvardera Valmet 840. 2, a obuhvatila je: 1) utjecaj smanjenja tereta na djelotvornost forvardera, 2) okolišnu pogodnost forvardera u uvjetima ograničene nosivosti tla temeljem nominalnoga tlaka na podlogu (Mellgren 1980) prednjih i stražnjih kotača vozila ovisno o masi utovarenoga drva, opremljenosti vozila užim (600 mm) i širim (710 mm) gumama, odnosno opremljenosti kotača stražnje (bogi) osovine gusjenicama. Granica je okolišne pogodnosti bilo dopušteno opterećenje tla ograničene nosivosti < 60 kPa (Owende i dr. 2002). Rezultati analize djelotvornosti izvoženja drva forvarderom pokazali su da je smanjenje tereta u uvjetima ograničene nosivosti glejnih tala, kao mjera koja osigurava kretnost vozila, ali i smanjenje razine oštećivanja šumskoga tla, izrazito neprihvatljiva zbog pada proizvodnosti i rasta jediničnih troškova. Iz analize je nominalnoga tlaka na podlogu ispod kotača prednje i kotača (gusjenica) stražnje osovine vidljivo da se u uvjetima ograničene nosivosti tla: 1) može iskoristiti nominalna nosivost forvardera te djelotvorno izvoziti drvo, 2) pri čemu će okolišnu pogodnost osigurati primjena četveroosovinskih (osmokotačnih) forvardera opremljenih širim gumama te polugusjenicama na kotačima prednje i stražnje bogi osovine vozila. This paper {{presents}} {{the research of}} possibilities of forwarding timber in an efficient and environmentally friendly way, under conditions of limited bearing capacity of gley soils of Croatian lowland forests due to their increased moisture all the year round. Reduced soil bearing capacity causes restricted mobility and decreases the forwarder productivity, and also increases the level of damage caused to forest soil, reflected in its compaction and rutting (Fig. 1). In lowland even-aged forests of Croatia, main felling is mostly carried out based on wood cutting and processing by chain saws and forwarding of timber, processed by cut-to-length method, by six-wheel forwarders, usually not equipped with semitracks on rear wheels of bogie axle (Fig. 1). The analysis was carried out on {{the example of a}} medium-weight six-wheel forwarder Valmet 840. 2 (nominal load capacity of 12 t, whose dimensions and load distribution of empty vehicle are shown in Fig. 4), and this analysis involved as follows: 1) the effect of load reduction on forwarder efficiency, 2) forwarder environmental soundness under conditions of limited soil strength based on nominal ground pressure (Mellgren 1980) of front and rear wheels of the vehicle depending on the mass of loaded timber, vehicle with narrower (600 mm) and wider (710 mm) tires, or with tracks on wheels of the rear (bogie) axle. The limit value of environmental soundness would be the allowed ground pressure of limited bearing capacity < 60 kPa (Owende et al. 2002). The effect of load reduction (4 t, 8 t with respect to 12 t of the vehicle nominal load capacity) on forwarder efficiency with respect to the distance of timber forwarding, is expressed according to the multicriteria calculation model of productivity of these vehicles (Stankić 2010), which takes into account: 1) forwarder class 2) soil strength, 3) use of tracks, 4) felling density, 5) volume of the average felling tree and 6) distance of timber forwarding. The unit cost of timber forwarding was calculated according to <b>machine</b> <b>rate</b> made by the company »Hrvatske šume» d. o. o Zagreb for the forwarder Valmet 840. 2 (433. 19 kn/h). For calculating the nominal ground pressure (Fig. 3), a theoretical model of axle load distribution was used, the case of vehicle at standstill on level ground, depending on mass and length of loaded logs in the bunk area of the forwarder (Poršinsky and Horvat 2005). The analysis of axle load distribution was based on an average length of logs (4 m) made by cut-to-length method {{in the area of the}} Croatian lowland forests, and the mass of 1800 kg of a pair of semitracks. The wheel load assumed even load distribution of axle load by pertaining wheels. The contact area between wheels (tracks) and soil was calculated according to Mellgren (1980), for narrower (front – 600 / 65 - 34, rear – 600 / 55 - 26. 5) and wider (front – 710 / 55 - 34, rear – 710 / 45 - 26. 5) tires recommended by the manufacturer of forwarder. The analysis of the forwarder environmental soundness was based on: 1) values of nominal ground pressure of front and rear wheels of the vehicle depending on the mass of loaded timber, and use of narrower and wider tires, i. e. or use of tracks, and 2) the upper limit value of the allowed ground pressure (< 60 kPa) of limited bearing capacity (class 3 – Fig. 2), which prevails at the time of main felling in the Croatian lowland forests. The results of efficiency analysis of timber forwarding (Fig. 5) showed that the reduction of load under conditions of limited bearing capacity of gley soils, as a measure for providing vehicle mobility as well as for diminishing the level of damage caused to forest soil, is highly unacceptable due to the decrease of productivity and increase of unit costs. The analysis of nominal ground pressure (Fig. 7) under wheels of the front axle and wheels (tracks) of the rear axle, showed that under conditions of limited soil bearing capacity: 1) the forwarder nominal load capacity may be used and that efficient timber forwarding may be performed, 2) the environmental soundness can be provided by the application of four-axle (eight-wheel) forwarders equipped with wider tires and half-tracks on wheels of front and rear bogie axle of the vehicle. These results should be used as guidelines for purchasing forwarders, and such approach would provide in future ecoefficient timber forwarding under conditions of limited bearing capacity of gley soils in main felling sites of lowland forests...|$|E

40|$|AbstractElectric {{discharge}} machining (EDM) is a well-established non-conventional machining {{process for the}} machining of electrically conductive and difficult-to-machine materials. But its applications are limited because of slow <b>machining</b> <b>rate</b> and relatively poor surface finish. Powder mixed EDM (PMEDM) {{is one of the}} recent advancements in EDM process where the addition of powder particles to the dielectric results in higher <b>machining</b> <b>rate</b> and better surface quality. In this work, Aluminum/Alumina metal matrix composite (MMC), which has many applications in automobile and aero-space industry, was fabricated and machined in EDM by mixing aluminum powder in kerosene dielectric. The effect process parameters (powder concentration, peak current, pulse on time and duty cycle) on two responses namely, material removal rate (MRR) and surface roughness (SR) were measured. A multi response optimization was performed using grey relational analysis (GRA) to find the optimum combination of the process parameters for maximum MRR and minimum SR. The results show that the powder concentration of 6 g/L gives the optimum result for the multi responses...|$|R
40|$|Wire Electrical Discharge Machining (WEDM) is a nontraditional {{machining}} process used for machining intricate shapes in high strength and temperature resistive (HSTR) materials. WEDM provides high accuracy, repeatability, {{and a better}} surface finish; however the tradeoff is a very slow <b>machining</b> <b>rate.</b> Due to the slow <b>machining</b> <b>rate</b> in WEDM, <b>machining</b> tasks take many hours depending on {{the complexity of the}} job. Because of this, users of WEDM try to predict <b>machining</b> <b>rate</b> beforehand so that input parameter values can be pre-programmed to achieve automated machining. However, partial success with traditional methodologies such as thermal modeling, artificial neural networks, mathematical, statistical, and empirical models left this problem still open for further research and exploration of alternative methods. Also, earlier efforts in applying the decision tree rule induction algorithms for predicting the <b>machining</b> <b>rate</b> in WEDM had limitations such as use of coarse grained method of discretizing the target and exploration of only C 4. 5 as the learning algorithm. The goal of this dissertation was to address the limitations reported in literature in using decision tree rule induction algorithms for WEDM. In this study, the three decision tree inductive algorithms C 5. 0, CART and CHAID have been applied for predicting material removal rate when the target was discretized into varied number of classes (two, three, four, and five classes) by three discretization methods. There were a total of 36 distinct combinations when learning algorithms, discretization methods, and number of classes in the target are combined. All of these 36 models have been developed and evaluated based on the prediction accuracy. From this research, a total of 21 models found to be suitable for WEDM that have prediction accuracy ranging from 71. 43 % through 100 %. The models indentified in the current study not only achieved better prediction accuracy compared to previous studies, but also allows the users to have much better control over WEDM than what was previously possible. Application of inductive learning and development of suitable predictive models for WEDM by incorporating varied number of classes in the target, different learning algorithms, and different discretization methods have been the major contribution of this research...|$|R
