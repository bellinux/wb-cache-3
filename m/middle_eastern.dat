5|$|According to an {{academic}} study, people {{perceived to be}} <b>Middle</b> <b>Eastern</b> were {{as likely to be}} victims of hate crimes as followers of Islam during this time. The study also found a similar increase in hate crimes against people who may have been perceived as Muslims, Arabs, and others thought to be of <b>Middle</b> <b>Eastern</b> origin. A report by the South Asian American advocacy group known as South Asian Americans Leading Together, documented media coverage of 645 bias incidents against Americans of South Asian or <b>Middle</b> <b>Eastern</b> descent between September 11 and 17. Various crimes such as vandalism, arson, assault, shootings, harassment, and threats in numerous places were documented.|$|E

40|$|The old socialistic {{states of}} <b>Middle</b> and <b>Eastern</b> Europe is {{positively}} trying to accede to the EMU {{in order to}} enjoy the manifold rights of joining currency combination, not mention the political and diplomatic purposes. The EU brought forward the regulation of macro-economic reduction, system and law terms as the requirement of the entrance of those <b>Middle</b> and <b>Eastern</b> Europe countries. According to a survey, including Poland and Hungary, countries which {{took the lead in}} reforming agreed with EU on most of EU’ requirements about acceding to EMU. However, because of the domestic and foreign economic conditions, in the next 1 or 2 years, none of the <b>Middle</b> and <b>Eastern</b> Europe countries could meet the requirement of reducing macro-economy. Whereas the degree of fulfillment of the economy reducing requirement and the factor that the <b>Middle</b> and <b>Eastern</b> Europe countries could accede to EU after 2003, it was predicted that those countries could accede to EMU only after 2005. With the coming on of EMU, the <b>Middle</b> and <b>Eastern</b> countries will accelerate the activity of currency combination. The South Korean government and enterprises also should intensify the prediction and precaution to the systems, policy change and other economic effects of these <b>Middle</b> and <b>Eastern</b> Europe countries...|$|R

5|$|The 15-year-long Lebanese Civil War {{that started}} in 1975 and the Iranian {{revolution}} of 1979 greatly contributed to the influx of <b>Middle</b> <b>Eastern</b> Armenians to the US. The Armenian communities in these <b>Middle</b> <b>Eastern</b> countries were well established and integrated, but not assimilated, into local populations. Armenians in Lebanon and Iran are represented in the parliaments as ethnic minorities. Many lived in luxury in their former countries, and more easily handled multilingualism, while retaining aspects of traditional Armenian culture. This wave of newcomers revitalized the Armenian American community, especially in the Los Angeles area, where most second-wave Armenian immigrants settled. In 1970 about 65,000 Armenians resided in Southern California, and two decades later, in 1989, the number of Armenian Americans was estimated at 200,000. Although the 1980 US Census put the number of Armenians living in Los Angeles at 52,400, of which 71.9% were foreign born: 14.7% in Iran, 14.3% in the USSR, 11.5% in Lebanon, 9.7% in Turkey, 11.7% in other <b>Middle</b> <b>Eastern</b> countries (Egypt, Iraq, Palestine, etc.), and the rest {{in other parts of}} the world.|$|E

5|$|Triaenops menamena is {{currently}} {{one of four}} living species in the genus Triaenops; a 2009 revision by Petr Benda and Peter Vallo split off the African T.afer and the Yemeni T.parvus from T.persicus and removed three other species, including two from Madagascar, to the separate genus Paratriaenops. An extinct species, Triaenops goodmani, is known from northwestern Madagascar. In 2007 and 2008, Amy Russell and colleagues used phylogenetic and coalescent methodologies to investigate {{the history of the}} Triaenops group. They found that T.menamena (as T.rufus) was closest to mainland African Triaenops (but did not study <b>Middle</b> <b>Eastern</b> bats) and concluded that T.menamena and the species of Paratriaenops (then still placed in Triaenops) independently reached Madagascar from Africa; the colonization of the island by T.menamena was dated to about 660,000 years ago. Benda and Vallo also studied phylogenetic relationships in Triaenops and included <b>Middle</b> <b>Eastern</b> T.persicus and T.parvus in their analysis. They found little resolution of relationships within Triaenops, but some evidence suggested that T.menamena is more closely related to the <b>Middle</b> <b>Eastern</b> species than to T.afer in mainland Africa; therefore, T.menamena may have reached Madagascar from the Middle East or northeastern Africa. They also placed the split between T.menamena and the other species much further back, at around 4 million years ago.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to obtain general {{information}} from students who have different culturesabout using e-mail, chat & discussion groups at internet for educational purposes. For this study quantitativeapproach was used. Sample size was 301 (221 male – 80 female). The sample comprised university students fromNorth Cyprus and South Cyprus. We classified the students according to their cultures. So these groups are TurkishCypriots (n= 65), Greek Cypriots (n= 50), Turkish (n= 75), European (n= 27), <b>Middle</b> <b>Easterner</b> (n= 68) and Asian(n= 21). In this study we used a scale designed to get “the opinions of university students about using e-mail, chat anddiscussion groups on the internet for educational purposes” and demographic information forms. This study showedthat, the students use discussion groups and e-mail the most and IRC (chat) the least. According to this study when itanalyzed the knowledge gap between students from different countries it was seen that <b>Middle</b> <b>Easterner</b> students’have higher perception about the use of discussion groups than the Cypriot Turkish and Turkish. And students whouse the internet everyday have higher perception about the use of e-mail than the other students...|$|R
