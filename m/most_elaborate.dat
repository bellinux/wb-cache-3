5|$|Many Puranas tell Krishna's {{life story}} or some {{highlights}} from it. Two Puranas, the Bhagavata Purana and the Vishnu Purana, contain the <b>most</b> <b>elaborate</b> telling of Krishna's story, but the life stories of Krishna {{in these and}} other texts vary, and contain significant inconsistencies. The Bhagavata Purana consists of twelve books subdivided into 332chapters, with a cumulative total of between 16,000 and 18,000 verses depending on the version. The tenth book of the text, which contains about 4,000 verses (~25%) and is dedicated to legends about Krishna, {{has been the most}} popular and widely studied part of this text.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosperity}} stimulated {{a building}} boom that was underway by the mid-1830s, {{with the building}} {{of some of the}} <b>most</b> <b>elaborate</b> structures the city had seen up to that point. This was cut short in part by the Panic of 1837 and yellow fever epidemics. The waterfront was developed with wharves, terminal facilities, and fireproof brick warehouses. The exports of cotton grew in proportion to the amounts being produced in the Black Belt; by 1840 Mobile was second only to New Orleans in cotton exports in the nation.|$|E
5|$|An era {{came to an}} end in 1668 {{with two}} events: Davenant died suddenly, leaving a messy {{ownership}} situation for the Duke's Company, and Pepys' eyesight forced him to stop keeping a diary. Thomas Betterton, though formally a minority shareholder, continued to run the Duke's Company, and, in the spirit of Davenant, commissioned the <b>most</b> <b>elaborate</b> of the Restoration playhouses, the theatre at Dorset Garden (or Dorset Gardens), with a flat for himself on top. Although the Dorset Garden Theatre quickly became a famous and glamorous venue, very little is concretely known about the building and outfitting of it: a vague and undocumented tradition ascribes its design to Christopher Wren. The absence of Pepys' record means that performance data for the next decades are only patchily known.|$|E

5|$|From the Bronze Age {{there are}} {{extensive}} examples of rock art. These include cup and ring marks, a central depression carved into stone, surrounded by rings, sometimes not completed.

The <b>most</b> <b>elaborate</b> sets of markings are in western Scotland, particularly in the Kilmartin district. The representations of an axe and a boat at the Ri Cruin Cairn in Kilmartin, and a boat pecked into Wemyss Cave, {{are believed to be}} the oldest known representations of real objects that survive in Scotland. Carved spirals have also been found on the cover stones of burial cists in Lanarkshire and Kincardine.|$|E
5|$|In Toraja society, {{the funeral}} ritual is the <b>most</b> <b>elaborate</b> and {{expensive}} event. The {{richer and more}} powerful the individual, the more expensive is the funeral. In the aluk religion, only nobles {{have the right to}} have an extensive death feast. The death feast of a nobleman is usually attended by thousands and lasts for several days. A ceremonial site, called rante, is usually prepared in a large, grassy field where shelters for audiences, rice barns, and other ceremonial funeral structures are specially made by the deceased family. Flute music, funeral chants, songs and poems, and crying and wailing are traditional Toraja expressions of grief with the exceptions of funerals for young children, and poor, low-status adults.|$|E
5|$|In {{support of}} this album, Bowie {{embarked}} on the Glass Spider Tour, a world tour that {{was at that point}} the biggest, most theatrical and <b>most</b> <b>elaborate</b> tour he had undertaken in his career. The tour, like the album it supported, was commercially successful but critically panned. The critical failure of the album and tour were factors that led Bowie to look for a new way to motivate himself creatively, leading him to create the band Tin Machine in 1989 and to retire his back catalogue from live performances during his 1990 Sound+Vision Tour. Bowie did not release another solo album until Black Tie White Noise in 1993.|$|E

5|$|The {{accident}} {{that would take}} the life of Samuel Collyer came in July 1884. While responding to the fire alarm, hose carriage number one struck an upright stone post on the corner on Mineral Spring and Lonsdale Avenue and tipped over. All six firefighters were injured in the accident, those less seriously were on the step and seat of the carriage, but Collyer who rode on the reel was crushed underneath. Collyer sustained a punctured lung and broken ribs, but managed to survive for almost three weeks before succumbing to his injuries. Contemporary accounts state that the funeral service and procession were the <b>most</b> <b>elaborate</b> of any in the town's history. Collyer's home, known as the Potter-Collyer House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{discouraged}} {{the burial}} of grave goods so {{the majority of}} examples of insular metalwork that survive from the Christian period {{have been found in}} archaeological contexts that suggest they were rapidly hidden, lost or abandoned. There are a few exceptions, notably portable shrines ("cumdachs") for books or relics, several of which have been continuously owned, mostly by churches on the Continent—though the Monymusk Reliquary has always been in Scotland. The highest quality survivals are either secular jewellery, the largest and <b>most</b> <b>elaborate</b> pieces probably for male wearers, tableware or altarware. The finest church pieces were probably made by secular workshops, often attached to a royal household, though other pieces were made by monastic workshops. There are a number of large brooches, each of their designs is wholly individual in detail, and the workmanship is varied. Many elements of the designs can be directly related to elements used in manuscripts. Surviving stones used in decoration are semi-precious ones, with amber and rock crystal among the commonest, and some garnets. Coloured glass, enamel and millefiori glass, probably imported, are also used. None of the major insular manuscripts, like the Book of Kells, have preserved their elaborate jewelled metal covers, but documentary evidence indicates that these were as spectacular as the few remaining continental examples.|$|E
5|$|In November 1989, the Berlin Wall fell, and in July 1990 Waters staged one of {{the largest}} and <b>most</b> <b>elaborate</b> rock concerts in history, The Wall– Live in Berlin, on the vacant terrain between Potsdamer Platz and the Brandenburg Gate. The show {{reported}} an official attendance of 200,000, though some estimates are as much as twice that, with approximately one billion television viewers. Leonard Cheshire asked him to do the concert to raise funds for charity. Waters' group of musicians included Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Cyndi Lauper, Bryan Adams, Scorpions, and Sinéad O'Connor. Waters also used an East German symphony orchestra and choir, a Soviet marching band, and a pair of helicopters from the U.S. 7th Airborne Command and Control Squadron. Designed by Mark Fisher, the Wall was 25metres tall and 170metres long and was built across the set. Scarfe's inflatable puppets were recreated on an enlarged scale, and although many rock icons received invitations to the show, Gilmour, Mason, and Wright, did not. Waters released a live double-album of the performance, which has been certified platinum by the RIAA.|$|E

Joseph Eddy Fontenrose suggests that, for Nonnus, Campe is a Greek refiguring of Tiamat and that [...] "she is Echidna under another name, as Nonnos indicates, calling her Echidnaean Enyo, identifying her snaky legs with Echidna's", and [...] "a female counterpart of his Typhon".|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} in several apparently unrelated fields has highlighted the insights afforded by distinguishing between {{two forms of}} knowledge: explicit knowledge — in its <b>most</b> <b>elaborated</b> form, science — and tacit knowledge — in its <b>most</b> <b>elaborated</b> form, art. Explicit knowledge consists of facts, theories and principles that are codified in research journals, taught in schools, and recorded in industry. In contrast, tacit knowledge is personal and cannot easily be communicated. In industry, tacit knowledge is particularly valued in the skill of a craft worker and the design know-how of an engineer — in general, the accumulated tricks of the trade. This research suffers, however, from an important limitation, a limitation inherited perhaps from Michael Polanyi’s (1958, 1966) original treatment of the issue: it has relied on an exclusively static contrast between tacit and explicit knowledge. In reality, the relationship between tacit and explicit knowledge is not static. For example, while many traditional manufacturing operations rely on extensive bodies of tacit “art ” such as found in the skills of craft workers, these skill...|$|R
5|$|Krishna {{is found}} in {{southeast}} Asian history and art, but to a far less extent than Shiva, Durga, Nandi, Agastya, and Buddha. In temples (candi) of the archaeological sites in hilly volcanic Java, Indonesia, temple reliefs do not portray his pastoral life or {{his role as the}} erotic lover, nor do the historic Javanese Hindu texts. Rather, either his childhood or the life as a king and Arjuna's companion have been more favored. The <b>most</b> <b>elaborate</b> temple arts of Krishna are found in a series of Krsnayana reliefs in the Prambanan Hindu temple complex near Yogyakarta. These are dated to the 9thcentury CE. Krishna remained a part of the Javanese cultural and theological fabric through the 14thcentury, as evidenced by the 14th-century Penataran reliefs along with those of the Hindu god Rama in east Java, before Islam replaced Buddhism and Hinduism on the island.|$|E
5|$|On days of {{particular}} religious significance, the daily rituals were replaced with festival observances. Different festivals occurred at different intervals, though most were annual. Their timing {{was based on}} the Egyptian civil calendar, which most of the time was far {{out of step with the}} astronomical year. Thus, while many festivals had a seasonal origin, their timing lost its connection with the seasons. Most festivals took place at a single temple, but others could involve two or more temples or an entire region of Egypt; a few were celebrated throughout the country. In the New Kingdom and later, the festival calendar at a single temple could include dozens of events, so it is likely that most of these events were observed only by the priests. In those festivals that involved a procession outside the temple, the local population also gathered to watch and to celebrate. These were the <b>most</b> <b>elaborate</b> temple ceremonies, accompanied by the recitation of hymns and the performance of musicians.|$|E
5|$|The Osiris myth is the <b>most</b> <b>elaborate</b> and {{influential}} story in ancient Egyptian mythology. It concerns {{the murder of}} the god Osiris, a primeval king of Egypt, and its consequences. Osiris's murderer, his brother Set, usurps his throne. Meanwhile, Osiris's wife Isis restores her husband's body, allowing him to posthumously conceive a son with her. The remainder of the story focuses on Horus, the product of the union of Isis and Osiris, who is at first a vulnerable child protected by his mother and then becomes Set's rival for the throne. Their often violent conflict ends with Horus's triumph, which restores order to Egypt after Set's unrighteous reign and completes the process of Osiris's resurrection. The myth, with its complex symbolism, is integral to the Egyptian conceptions of kingship and succession, conflict between order and disorder, and especially death and the afterlife. It also expresses the essential character of each of the four deities at its center, and many elements of their worship in ancient Egyptian religion were derived from the myth.|$|E

Even San Antonio's famed Sporting District, once one of the nation's largest red-light districts, was shut down in 1941. As state investigations of the Maceos' activities became more serious, Sam and Rose began plans to move their empire to Nevada. The Maceos became major investors in the Desert Inn, which was the largest and <b>most</b> <b>elaborate</b> casino resort on the Las Vegas Strip when it opened in 1950. Moe Dalitz (who opened the Desert Inn) and Sam Maceo had long been allies and business partners. The Las Vegas project's financing was largely facilitated by the Maceos and Moodys through ANICO (which loaned millions to known mob figures). Soon ANICO was one of the largest lenders to Las Vegas casinos. Sam and Rose Maceo transferred controlling interest of most of their Galveston empire to a new group dominated by the Fertitta family, with investments coming from business interests around the island. The Fertitta group never wielded the influence that the Maceos had (though a generation later Tilman and Frank Fertitta came to be major entertainment magnates themselves). Sam Maceo died in 1951 and Rose in 1954.|$|E
