However, when Randy and others find out that Mr. Kim is creating his own gentrified district named CtPa Town (pronounced: [...] "shitty part of town") and hiring children, they mob his restaurant and force the child laborers out, leading to a massive brawl. However, everyone becomes silent when they notice that the representative was observing the fight. He, however, seems to like the energy that the town put in to impress him and decides that the city will have the market. Everyone cheers and leaves, except for Kenny and Kim, who grants Kenny his [...] "child labor wage". Kenny then comes back home and gives his sister a doll paid for by his meager wages. Kenny goes to sleep in his room despite the loud nocturnal noises from SodoSopa. The episode ends with a mock commercial featuring the citizens walking inside the new Whole Foods Market — which turns out to be located in CtPa Town, as SodoSopa itself has been abandoned.|$|E

Then the article exposes the factors used to set the price of gasoline in Colombia. Finally, it is concluded that the price of Colombian gasoline is very high and does not follow the equation proposed by the government and the factors that have the most influence on the final price are the producer income mainly affected by the WTI and the <b>Market</b> <b>Representative</b> Rate...|$|E

The fact that ERP systems require high resources in term of cost, time and people in order to be implemented and maintained introduced many difficulties for organizations to set up such a vital system, which was the driving force to try to benefit from cloud computing to help organizations to implement ERP systems with less implementation cost and time. The product of this research was an intersect between the available relevant knowledge, and the market, where some market representatives were interviewed to bridge the gap between theoretical and practical point of views, and get deeper understanding regarding issues and features of ERP as cloud service. The purpose of this research was influenced by the potential benefits of using cloud computing technology to implement ERP systems with less time, cost and failure risk consequences, and how ERP as cloud service could ease ERP implementation and reduce required resources from both customers and vendors.

40|$|Fresh-cut or ready-to-eat produce {{including}} raw produce {{are becoming}} more popular due to changes in people’s lifestyle and constraints such as time pressure and lack of convenience. However, several reports showed that enteric diseases linked to consumption of fresh produce have dramatically increased in the last decades. Microbial contamination occurs during growth, harvesting, processing, distribution, and preparation. Systematic studies are lacking in Belgium to identify the current microbial situation and the critical points along the fresh produce chain. Therefore, a sampling plan was developed to address the data needs, to define the bottlenecks, identify and further understand routes for potential microbial contamination of produce throughout production and processing in Belgium. Insight was achieved {{in the implementation of}} good agricultural practices in the primary production process by the combination of an interview, checklist and exploitation of microbial data of lettuce crops and environmental sampling (water, soil) for both greenhouses and open field farms. Two ready-to-eat processors were sampled to gain insight into the impact of the water quality on the microbial quality, hygiene and safety level of fresh-cut lettuce products for the Belgian <b>market</b> <b>representative</b> processing companies. Due to the survey, the major bottlenecks were established being the lack of microbiological knowledge and the management of the irrigation and washing water. Other problems established were the commonly “generic” guidelines in place both in primary production and in the processing industry...|$|E

Design/Methodology/Approach The sponsorship model is tested using survey data from target <b>market</b> <b>representative</b> samples in two professional sports contexts and two cultural contexts. Findings The model works almost equally well in both contexts. Furthermore, a more parsimonious mediated effects model provides virtually the same results as the full model. Improving attitude towards the sponsorship and object equity {{are found to be}} the most important factors for improving sponsor equity. The model also confirms earlier research on the importance of sponsor sincerity and sponsor-object fit in determining sponsorship effects. Research Limitation The explained variance of the sincerity and object equity constructs was not as high as for other constructs in the model. Practical Implications Sponsorship managers should pre-test potential objects and sponsorship communications to make sure that constructs in the model such as fit, sincerity, sponsorship attitudes, and object equity are maximized to provide optimal sponsor equity. Value The model combines constructs from various literatures into a comprehensive model of high-level sponsorship effects. Furthermore, while most previous sponsorship research have used convenience samples and/or fictional and/or single sponsorship contexts, the comprehensive model tested here is shown to have high external validity by its consistently good performance in predicting sponsorship effects using four real sponsorships and representative samples...|$|E

40|$|The allies portrayed their {{defeat of}} Germany in 1918 as {{the triumph of}} liberal {{democracy}} over authoritarianism, a victory marked by {{the establishment of the}} League of Nations and the creation of the Weimar Republic. However, the Russian Revolution, the rise of fascism and the economic depression of the 1930 s almost immediately placed liberal democrats on the defensive. Critics argued that mass democracy and the spread of bureaucracy within both the private and public sectors had rendered the liberal ethic of the autonomous individual an anachronism. The corporate manager had replaced the entrepreneur within the economy, and the manipulation of popular opinion by the media and party machines had supplanted rational debate between disinterested individuals in politics. Individual identity and will were shaped by functional, ethnic and cultural group membership rather than innate preferences and capabilities, the exercise of reason, or effort. New social and economic conditions required novel forms of political and industrial organisation that combined decisive and expert leadership with efficient administration, thereby harnessing popular support and energy to the collective good in a manner supposedly unavailable to liberals. The economic crisis was taken as confirming this diagnosis of liberal democracy’s malaise. The challenge to liberal democracy was threefold, therefore, involving an attack on the contemporary relevance of the <b>market,</b> <b>representative</b> democracy, and the values underlying them. In their various defences against such criticisms, the divisions amongst liberals were often as sharp as (and frequently mirrored) those between them and their opponents...|$|E

40|$|Heavy metal {{contamination}} in food {{is one of}} the food safety issues due to the potential human health risks. Mercury, the most volatile heavy metal, occurs widely in the environment from both natural sources and human activities Mercury exposure may cause neurotoxin effects and motor function impairment, harm the cardiovascular system and cause genetic damage. Dietary exposure is the main pathway for mercury intake for the population[1]. The aim of this study was determine the amounts of mercury in 150 different products from 9 food groups available on Portuguese <b>market,</b> <b>representative</b> of consumption by Portuguese population. These samples were collected during 2014 and 2015. Determination was carried in compliance with ISO standard 17025. Total mercury (Hg) was determined in a Direct Mercury Analyser DMA 80, according to United States Environmental Protection Agency test method 7473 (USEPA, 2007) [2]. We obtained a range 0, 2 to 13, 8 µg/Kg for the limit of quantification. Analytical quality control was achieved using certified reference material NIST 1566 b oyster tissue. Most of the results were below the limit of quantification (LOQ). However, 28 % of the results revealed measurable mercury. Analysis of this data indicated that the average intake of mercury from fish and seafood products can be near the tolerable weekly intakes established by JECFA (1, 6 µg/kg body weight). Although fish {{is an important part of}} a healthy diet as it provides important nutrients, it´s recommend that young children select fish from a wide range of species, without giving undue preference to large predatory fish such as swordfish and tuna. Due to their place in the food chain, these fish are likely to contain higher levels of methylmercury than other fish species. These results provide information on the analytical data on the chemical substances of interest and are contribution to food risk assessment. N/...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The Brazilian {{oil and gas}} market {{presents}} a perspective {{of growth in the}} next decades. Considering this scenario, the increasing number of participants in this supply chain is foreseen to supply the demand of goods and services, especially in the technological development area. The paper intends to evaluate the collaborative development capacity and respective measurements of performance on these partnerships established between customer and suppliers, through qualitative research with a sample of Brazilian oil and gas <b>market</b> <b>representative.</b> Design/methodology/approach: This paper intends to verify if the co-creation performance is measured after an implementation, specific in a restricted industry. The methodology consists in a bibliographical research to support the study, and it also had a questionnaire sent to Brazilian companies that take part of the oil and natural gas industry supply chain, to analyze if the results of co-creation activities are measured by this group of companies, to verify its attractiveness to develop the co-creation usage or change the type of partnership with the market. Findings and Originality/value: The misunderstanding of co-creation and technical partnership was noticed. The usage of teams working together from two or more organizations cannot be considered as a co-creation, because the relationship and obligations are different between these two ways of workgroup. But the companies of oil and gas industry, when questioned, were able to distinguish it, avoiding risks of incorrect results motivated by wrong interpretation of the paper content. Research limitations/implications: As related in the paper, eight companies were invited to take part on the questionnaire about co-creation, but only 50 % answered it. The research should have a better result of this subject if it had been developed with more answers of Brazilian oil and gas industry companies. Originality/value: Even this kind of partnership is used in oil and natural gas industrial segment, the measurement isn´t correct used. The value {{of this paper is to}} show that companies that are using co-creation could detect the best opportunities to apply it, due to the attractiveness that each situation can generate. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Restrictions on {{raw milk}} sales to {{off of the}} farm only constrict {{small-scale}} farmers who want to expand {{the sale of a}} product that they and raw milk consumers believe to be safe and healthful. In the 84 th Legislature in Texas, House Bill 91, which sought to allow the extension of raw milk sales to farmers’ markets and via delivery in Texas, passed in the House, but ultimately did not pass in the Senate to become law. Methods: Interviews were conducted with stakeholders of House Bill 91, including raw milk dairy farmers, public health officials, raw milk consumers, environmental health officials, a farmers’ <b>market</b> <b>representative,</b> and a Texas representative. Interview participants were asked about their opinions on the bill proposal, the current restrictions on raw milk sales in Texas, and the possible public health implications if a similar bill is to pass in the future. A policy analysis using a stakeholder analysis matrix was conducted to compare HB 91 with alternative solutions. Results: 13 stakeholders were interviewed in total. Of these, eight are proponents of expanding raw milk sales to farmers’ markets and via delivery in Texas, five against, and none neutral. Using the insight from and common themes that emerged in conducted stakeholder interviews, a stakeholder analysis and policy analysis matrix were conducted. Analysis matrices were used as tools to determine values for the Public Acceptability, Political Acceptability, Bureaucratic Feasibility, and Policy Goals of three separate policy solutions. House Bill 91, with an amendment adding raw milk testing and handling requirements, received the highest ratings overall of all three policy solutions. Conclusion: House Bill 91, with an added amendment, is the best policy solution for the state of Texas, based on stakeholder interviews, a stakeholder analysis matrix, and a policy analysis matrix. This research provides insight into various reasons in support and opposition of the expansion of raw milk sales in Texas, and offers a potential policy solution to Texas legislators. ...|$|E
