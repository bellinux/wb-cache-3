While greener biological synthesis has better eco-friendly, cost-effective, and easily large-scaled properties and are motivating a research upsurge in exploring the plants as reducing and protecting agents [7], such as Pulicaria glutinosa [8], P. glutinosa [9], and Moringa oleifera [10]. Plant extracts are rich of functional molecules such as phenolic compounds, which have been regarded as potent natural reducers with high antioxidant activity [11, 12]. Longan (Dimocarpus Longan Lour.), an edible fruit, is cultivated widely in southern China and south-east Asia. With rich bioactive polysaccharides, phenolic acids, and flavonoids [13, 14], its flesh or seed is {{a good source of}} functional ingredients for antioxidant, immunity-modulatory, insomnia relief, and memory-enhancing effects [15 – 19]. Whereas peels, regarded as a waste usually, have an untapped potential in the resource utilization and might be available for potential green synthesis purposes.|$|R

The village mayor is unwilling to give her money for a bus ticket to the city, so she resolves to earn the money herself, and recruits the remaining students to help. One girl suggests that they can make money by moving bricks in a nearby brickyard, and Wei begins giving the students mathematical exercises centered on finding out how much money they need to earn for the bus tickets, how many bricks they need to move, and how much time it will take. Through these exercises and working to earn money, her rapport with the class improves. After earning the money, she reaches the bus station but learns that the price is higher than she thought, and she cannot afford a ticket.

40|$|Large {{concentrations}} {{of fish in}} fishponds have always attracted ichtyophagic birds exclusively for easy and plentiful catch. In <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fish production process, some bird species, depending on how numerous they are, cause considerable economic damage. <b>The</b> existence <b>of</b> cormorants (Phalacro- corax carbo) in great numbers both on fish farms and on open waters during the last 16 years has resulted in <b>the</b> disappearance <b>of</b> large quantities of fish, {{one or two years}} old in particular, and has brought <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fish farms to <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> economic breakdown.

5|$|Each route was {{extended}} to Sacramento in 1933 over the aforementioned county highways, taking Route 50 southeast from Rumsey to Woodland near Cache Creek and then alongside the Sacramento River to the I Street Bridge, and Route 54 west from the county line to Route 11 just outside Sacramento. The entirety of both routes, from SR 20 near Wilbur Springs through Sacramento to State Route 49 just north of Drytown (and initially overlapping SR 49 to Jackson), {{was included in the}} initial state sign route system in 1934 as Sign Route 16. Through downtown Sacramento, SR 16 followed U.S. 40 (Legislative Route 6) and U.S. 50 (Legislative Route 11), mostly on Capitol Avenue, while Legislative Route 50 continued south on 5th Street (later a one-way pair of 3rd and 5th Streets) and turned east on Broadway, carrying Sign Route 24 <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to Freeport Boulevard. In the 1964 renumbering, Route 16 became the new legislative designation, and Sign Route 24 through Sacramento was replaced with State Route 99 and State Route 160. As neither of these used what had been Sign Route 24 along 3rd and 5th Streets and Broadway, part of Route 16's new definition ("Route 5 near Woodland to Sacramento") was used for several years on this alignment until it became part of State Route 99 later that decade. This left the western segment of SR 16 ending at Interstate 5 near the east end of the I Street Bridge until 1984, when the Woodland-Sacramento portion, which had become redundant with the parallel Interstate 5 complete, was deleted from the legislative definition. After this, SR 16 was rerouted from the intersection with County Route E7 to continue north on a bypass of Woodland instead of east to Interstate 5.|$|E
