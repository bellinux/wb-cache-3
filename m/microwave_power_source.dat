50|$|Thermal sensors can {{generally}} {{be divided into}} two main categories, thermocouple power sensors and thermistor-based power sensors. Thermal sensors depend on the process of absorbing the RF and microwave signal energy, and sense the resulting heat rise. Therefore, they respond to true average power of the signal, whether it is pulsed, CW, AM/FM or any complex modulation. (Agilent 2008).Thermocouple power sensors make up the majority of the thermal power sensors sold at present. They are generally reasonably linear and have a reasonably fast response time and dynamic range. The microwave power is absorbed in a load whose temperature rise is measured by the thermocouple. Thermocouple sensors often require a reference DC or <b>microwave</b> <b>power</b> <b>source</b> for calibration before measuring; this can be built into the power meter.Thermistor-based power sensors such as the Agilent 8478B are generally only used in situations where their excellent linearity is important, as they are both much slower and have a smaller dynamic range than either thermocouple or diode-based sensors. Thermistor-based power sensors are still the sensor of choice for power transfer standards because of their DC power substitution capability (Agilent 2006).Other thermal sensing technologies include microwave calorimeters and bolometers,and quasi-optic pulsed microwave sensors.|$|E

40|$|Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) has {{exploded}} in popularity {{over the last}} few years, finally realizing its potential to overcome the detrimental lack of sensitivity that has plagued performing NMR experiments. Applied to magic angle spinning (MAS) experiments, this renaissance of DNP has been primarily driven by the development of instrumentation; namely gyrotron oscillators as high-power stable <b>microwave</b> <b>power</b> <b>sources</b> and the NMR probes and associated equipment required to spin samples routinely below 100 Kelvin. The first three chapters of this thesis provide an overview of the theory, instrumentation, and applications of DNP. Chapter 1 introduces the magnetic resonance Hamiltonian with a focus on interactions that are necessary to control in order to obtain high-resolution DNP spectra. Chapters 2 and 3 are published reviews of DNP. Whereas Chapter 2 targets magnetic resonance spectroscopists, Chapter 3 is intended for an electric engineering audience. Both reviews are included as the associated depth and coverage of the topics are complementary and lead {{to a better understanding of}} DNP. The later chapters describe in detail advancements in probe, cryogenics, and gyrotron technology required to perform DNP MAS experiments, as well as the gains in sensitivity and resolution such instrumentation has permitted. Of particular importance is the development of a cryogenic sample ejection system that resulted in exquisite resolution of spectra recorded 10 W across the band, which results in substantially improved DNP performance. by Alexander B.

The buncher and the slow-wave structure can operate in either a travelling-wave state or a standing-wave state. In the buncher, the wiggler field together with the radiation field makes an electron beam bunched, and in the slow-wave structure the wiggler field keeps the beam bunched while the bunched beam interacts strongly with the slow-wave structure and so produces rf power. The bunching process comes from the free-electron laser mechanism and the generating process of rf power is in a slow-wave structure.
