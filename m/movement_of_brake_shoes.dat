40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} work, a {{friction}} composite material {{which will be}} used for material <b>of</b> train <b>brake</b> <b>shoe</b> was investigated to study the effect of ingredients on flexural strength. The Taguchi method is used to measure relative effect of ingredients on flexural strength of composite. Taguchi L 8 orthogonal array which consists of 7 factors with 2 levels each is applied to perform experiment. Ingredients of friction composite were considered as factors or parameters and % volume for each factor was varied at 2 levels. Phenolic resin and barite (BaSO 4) were not included as factor. Phenolic resin was always kept constant at 30 % volume and % volume of barite (BaSO 4) was varied to compensate the changing of other ingredients amount. The results show that glass fiber and cast iron chip have significant effect on increasing of flexural strength <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> <b>shoe</b> composite. Conversely, NBR has significant effect on decreasing of flexural strength <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> <b>shoe</b> material.

40|$|Railroad cars in coal {{service in}} the northeastern United States are often shopped for wheel defects such as slid flat, built up tread and spalling. Previous work found that these defects {{can be caused by}} wheel sliding after air {{pressure}} leaks through defective service and emergency brake valve portions into the brake cylinder. Another important factor in the creation of wheel defects from wheel sliding is the car’s empty braking ratio. If a car is excessively braked when empty, or has lost weight, there will be a greater chance for wheel sliding and damage. Wheel changeout data for different car classes were reviewed and several coal cars in the classes with the most wheel repairs were selected for detailed testing. The cars were given a complete air brake test, including a brake cylinder pressure test, and the brake system and wheels of each car was inspected.

50|$|Due to {{the fact}} that a drum brake's {{friction}} contact area is at the circumference <b>of</b> the <b>brake,</b> a drum brake can provide more braking force than an equal diameter disc brake. The increased friction contact area <b>of</b> drum <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> on the drum allows drum <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> to last longer than disc brake pads used in a <b>brake</b> system <b>of</b> similar dimensions and braking force. Drum brakes retain heat and are more complex than disc brakes but are often the more economical and powerful brake type to use in rear brake applications due to the low heat generation <b>of</b> rear <b>brakes,</b> a drum brake's self-applying nature, larger friction surface contact area, and long life wear characteristics (%life used/kW <b>of</b> <b>braking</b> power).|$|R
50|$|Rear drum <b>brakes</b> are {{typically}} <b>of</b> a leading/trailing design (for non-servo systems), or primary/secondary (for duo servo systems) the shoes being moved {{by a single}} double-acting hydraulic cylinder and hinged at the same point. In this design, one <b>of</b> the <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> always experiences the self-applying effect, irrespective of whether the vehicle is moving forwards or backwards. This is particularly useful on the rear brakes, where the parking brake (handbrake or footbrake) must exert enough force to stop the vehicle from traveling backwards and hold it on a slope. Provided the contact area <b>of</b> the <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> is large enough, which isn't always the case, the self-applying effect can securely hold a vehicle when the weight is transferred to the rear brakes due to the incline of a slope or the reverse direction of motion. A further advantage of using a single hydraulic cylinder on the rear is that the opposite pivot may {{be made in the}} form of a double-lobed cam that is rotated by the action <b>of</b> the parking <b>brake</b> system.|$|R

Their optimal values will be reached when storage costs, expressed by the cost function (the total mean value of the costs) are minimal, leading to a normal unfolding of the corrective maintenance activities.

50|$|The {{cantilever}} brake is a class <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> {{in which}} each arm {{is attached to a}} separate pivot point {{on one side of the}} seat stay or fork. Thus all cantilever brakes are dual-pivot. Both first- and second-class lever designs exist; second-class is by far the most common. In the second-class lever design, the arm pivots below the rim. The <b>brake</b> <b>shoe</b> is mounted above the pivot and is pressed against the rim as the two arms are drawn together. In the first-class lever design, the arm pivots above the rim. The <b>brake</b> <b>shoe</b> is mounted below the pivot and is pressed against the rim as the two arms are forced apart.Due to a wider possible distance between the mounts and pads, cantilever brakes are often preferred for bicycles that use wide tyres, such as on mountain bikes. Because the arms move only in their designed arcs, the <b>brake</b> <b>shoe</b> must be adjustable in several planes. Thus cantilever <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> are notoriously difficult to adjust.

The air and feed pumps were located in smokebox recesses behind the large Wagner smoke deflectors, which had been fitted from 01 077 onwards.

The Deutsche Bundesbahn converted their engines to the smaller Witte smoke deflectors and moved the pumps to the running board in the centre of the vehicle. The Deutsche Reichsbahn in East Germany shied away from such major changes to the load distribution, so that only minor modifications in appearance can be seen even in their last years.|$|R
