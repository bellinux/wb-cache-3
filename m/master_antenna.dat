NBC's FM station W2XDG, began transmitting from the antenna in 1940. NBC retained exclusive use {{of the top of}} the building until 1950, when the FCC ordered the exclusive deal broken, based on consumer complaints that a common location was necessary for the seven extant New York-area television stations to transmit from so that receiving antennas would not have to be constantly adjusted. Construction on a giant tower began on July 27, 1950. Other television broadcasters then joined RCA at the building, on the 83rd, 82nd, and 81st floors, often along with sister FM stations. Multiple transmissions of TV and FM began from the new tower in 1951, and was completed by 1953. Six broadcasters paid a combined $600,000 {{for the use of the}} antenna in 1951 per year.

40|$|Compared {{with other}} bands, the {{millimeter}} wave Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) has high accuracy and small size, {{which is a}} hot topic in InSAR research. On the other hand, shorter wavelength causes difficulties in 2 D imaging and interferometric phase extraction. In this study, the imaging and phase performance of the streaming Back Projection (BP) method combined with IMU data are analyzed and discussed {{on the basis of}} actual Ka-band InSAR data. It is found that because the wavelength of the Ka-band is short, it is more sensitive to the antenna phase-center history. To ensure the phase-preserving capacity, the IMU data must be used with accurate motion error compensation. Furthermore, during data processing, we verify the flat-earth-removing capacity of the BP algorithm that calculates and compensates the <b>master</b> and slave <b>antenna</b> phase centers individually...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{discusses}} RAMSES, the ONERA {{airborne radar}} system, and describes the calibration procedure used in polarimetric interferometric {{synthetic aperture radar}} (POLINSAR) mode. The RAMSES system has a single-pass POLINSAR capability in which the radar transmits alternately in H and V polarization and receives simultaneously on four channels (H and V for the <b>master</b> and slave <b>antennas).</b> It relies on a deramp-on-receive procedure, designed to permit very high resolution acquisitions when the sampling frequency can no longer match the transmitted bandwidth. This is {{at the cost of}} complexity in the received signals, as the deramp operation introduces a phase ramp in range whose slope {{is a function of the}} electronic delays in the channel before deramping, resulting in a different slope for the four receiving channels. This characteristic behavior of the deramp-on-receive mode makes relative phase calibration (essential for polarimetry, interferometry, and POLINSAR applications) considerably more complex...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand for smaller low-cost reconfigurable antennas {{that can be easily}} integrated with packaging structures. Reconfigurable Microstrip Patch Antennas (MSAs) received great attention in wireless communication systems due to their capability to vary their operating frequency, pattern and polarization. Reconfigurability enables us to accommodate more than one service using the same antenna. This thesis presents the analysis and design of new reconfigurable stacked (MSAs) of operating frequencies in the range of (2 - 5) GHz. The first new antenna is composed of two layers. The bottom layer is a MSA with two slots designed on each side that can be controlled via switches. By adjusting the statuses of the switches (that optimally fixed along the slots) we can vary the resonance frequencies, thus achieving frequency reconfigurability. In order {{to increase the number of}} resonance frequencies and to enhance the bandwidth and gain of the overall MSA, another patch is placed on top of the first antenna. The two patches are separated with a dielectric layer optimized to yield the maximum number of resonance frequencies, bandwidth and gain. The second antenna is the same as the first one but with switching top and bottom patches. Several results are included to verify the validity of the newly designed <b>antennas.</b> <b>Master</b> of Science of Electrical EngineeringMastersUniversity of New Mexico.
