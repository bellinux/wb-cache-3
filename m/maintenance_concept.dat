40|$|Digitalization is {{an ongoing}} {{revolution}} within manufacturing industry. 5 G technology is expected {{to play an important}} role in ensuring connectivity. Digitalized factories set high requirements on technical availability, and therefore also on maintenance performance. However, it is difficult to get top-level decision makers to invest in maintenance, since the effects are usually deferred and difficult to verify up front. For quantifying long term effects, Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is identified as a powerful tool. In this study, DES was combined with established <b>maintenance</b> <b>concepts</b> to provide analysis of a real-world industrial 5 G pilot implementation. <b>Maintenance</b> <b>concepts</b> were used to identify relevant inputs and outputs to the simulation model. The model was tested on a use case, where 5 G enables support for maintenance tasks.

40|$|AbstractRolling stock {{maintenance}} in the Netherlands traditionally {{is performed}} {{on several levels}} of complexity and therefore on levels of non-availability and cost. The challenge in optimizing performance and cost of rolling stock maintenance is to integrate the policy on <b>maintenance</b> <b>concepts,</b> <b>maintenance</b> locations and maintenance intervals (what, when & where). NedTrain as {{a subsidiary of the}} Netherlands Railways is developing and implementing this improved <b>concept</b> of <b>maintenance.</b> On one hand <b>maintenance</b> <b>concepts</b> are being improved based on the philosophy of Risk Based Maintenance, with customer demands on risks regarding safety, reliability, availability and cost as a basis for maintenance renewal. On the other hand - during analysis of current <b>maintenance</b> <b>concepts</b> and risk based improvements – modularization of maintenance tasks is taken into account leading to possibilities to perform these tasks on a lower complexity level, during natural non-availability moments of train sets (off-peak hours in daytime or at night) in local depots instead of larger workshops. With this maintenance policy “Performance Centered Maintenance”, performance improvements and cost reduction are being achieved. New strategies arise for investments in depots, train equipment (e. g. Real Time Monitoring) and training of mechanics. In this document a general overview and first results will be given of the approach...|$|R

During the Vietnam War, Tactical Air Command transferred flightline maintenance personnel to the deploying squadrons to Southeast Asia.

Traditionally, the development of on-board functions and <b>maintenance</b> <b>concepts</b> has been performed rather indepen-dently. The new approach is to focus on an integration of these two developments and to adapt a life cycle view together with a disregard of organizational boundaries.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of a preventive maintenance process largely {{depends on the}} ability to predict the replacement intervals of components.

The present paper proposes two new <b>maintenance</b> <b>concepts,</b> that combine the benefits of traditional static concepts and condition based <b>maintenance.</b> These new <b>concepts,</b> usage based <b>maintenance</b> and load based maintenance, apply usage or load parameters that are monitored during service to perform a physical model-based assessment of the system condition. The new concepts are positioned within the range of existing <b>maintenance</b> <b>concepts.</b> Also, the role of physical models in maintenance modelling in general is explained and the origin of uncertainty in the predicted service life is discussed. Moreover, it is demonstrated how the monitoring of usage, loads or condition can reduce this uncertainty and increase the service life, by extending existing work in this field. Finally, the different concepts are applied to a gas turbine blade case study to illustrate the benefits of the proposed concept...|$|R

This movement of squadrons came about due {{to the introduction of}} the AFM 66-1 combined <b>maintenance</b> <b>concept.</b> It was decided to keep aircraft of one general type in the same units for maintenance and supply considerations.

The aircraft has been designed for ease of maintenance, with 95% of all field replaceable parts [...] "one deep" [...] where nothing else has to be removed to get to the part in question.

50|$|CMUCPP was {{authorized}} in IFRS in the IASB's original Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements, Par. 104 (a) in 1989. In {{terms of the}} original Framework, (1989) Par 104 (a) accountants choose CMUCPP to implement a financial capital concept of invested purchasing power, i.e. financial CMUCPP {{at all levels of}} inflation and deflation instead of the traditional HC concept of invested money. They thus implement a CPP financial capital <b>maintenance</b> <b>concept</b> by measuring financial capital maintenance in units of CPP instead of traditional HC nominal monetary units and they implement a CPP profit/loss determination concept in units of CPP instead of in real value eroding nominal monetary units under HCA. Examples of constant items are issued share capital, retained income, capital reserves, all other items in shareholders´ equity, trade debtors, trade creditors, provisions, deferred tax assets and liabilities, all other non-monetary payables, all other non-monetary receivables, salaries, wages, rentals, all other items in the income statement, etc. Examples of variable items are property, plant, equipment, listed and unlisted shares, inventory, foreign exchange, etc. Variable items are valued in terms of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) at for example fair value, market value, recoverable value, present value, net realizable value, etc. or Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) during non-hyperinflationary periods.|$|E

40|$|In the {{changing}} and increasingly competitive industrial arena, companies are striving towards world-class competitiveness. This also puts maintenance under increasing pressure to improve, e. g., availability {{and reliability of}} production facilities, and to reduce cost and waste. With the introduction of Reliability-Centred Maintenance, Total Productive Maintenance, Business-Centred Maintenance and other concepts, maintenance already evolved a lot during the last decades. However, the resource intensiveness of these concepts and their validity for only a special class of equipment make a more general framework for <b>maintenance</b> <b>concept</b> development necessary. Such a general framework should provide decision guidelines about {{the focus of the}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>concept,</b> how to select the right maintenance policies and finally how to implement them.

40|$|The {{first part}} of the paper {{presents}} a survey of approaches to maintenance over the last thirty years. A structure of maintenance costs and <b>maintenance</b> <b>concept</b> adjustment and design (MA-CAD) of ship machinery (propulsion engine) is presented here, which provides the required safety level and lowest costs in a life cycle. Improvement and extension of the MA-CAD method can be achieved by analysis of the most common important parts of the propulsion engine that fail, mostly in operation, by designing maintenance intervals and planning spare parts quantity. A diesel-engine propulsion system with gearbox has been chosen for the research. The data on failure and maintenance activities at propulsion engine breakdown in a seaway within a period of thirteen years have been obtained from the engine′s log book. The critical parts that fail mostly in operation are defined by an analysis of breakdowns (registered failure cycles). The critical components include the exhaust valve, injection valve and fuel pump. The most vulnerable part of the propulsion engine is the exhaust valve with the highest failure rate. By application of the method mentioned we obtain a model for the <b>maintenance</b> <b>concept</b> adjustment and design. The suggested model consists of two parts (a new MA-CAD) : the ship and office. The engine machinery behaviour is monitored aboard the ship (failures and maintenance functioning) and the data are sent to the office.
