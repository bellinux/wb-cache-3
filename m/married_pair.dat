5|$|The Brute Man is a 1946 American {{film noir}} horor thriller film {{starring}} Rondo Hatton as the Creeper, a murderer seeking revenge {{against the people}} he holds responsible for the disfigurement of his face. Directed by Jean Yarbrough, the film features Tom Neal and Jan Wiley as a <b>married</b> <b>pair</b> of friends the Creeper blames for his deformities. Jane Adams also starred as a blind pianist for whom the Creeper tries {{to raise money for}} an operation to restore her vision.|$|E
25|$|When the Millennium Line was built, TransLink ordered new-generation Mark II ART trains from Bombardier Transportation, some {{of which}} were {{assembled}} in a Burnaby factory. Similar trains are used in Kuala Lumpur's Kelana Jaya Line, New York's JFK AirTrain, and the new Beijing Airport Express. These trains are run in four-car configurations on the Expo Line, and two-car configurations on the Millennium Line. Each pair of cars is semi-permanently joined together in a twin unit or 'married pair', with a length of 33.4 m. Mark II trains have a streamlined front and rear, an articulated joint allowing passengers to walk the length of a <b>married</b> <b>pair,</b> white/grey/blue interior, and six doors per car, three per side. TransLink also ordered 48 Mark II ART (2009/2010 model) in 2009 to further supplement supply and integrate new features like CCTV and visual maps with LED lights.|$|E
500|$|On January 14, 1993, a {{page-one}} {{story in}} The New York Times {{broke the news}} that Baird had hired a <b>married</b> <b>pair</b> of illegal aliens from Peru, Lillian and Victor Cordero, between 1990 and 1992. [...] The Peruvian woman served as the nanny for Baird's son and the Peruvian man as a part-time driver. Furthermore, Baird had not paid Social Security taxes for the couple, until making a lump-sum payment earlier in January 1993. Baird had brought forward this information willingly to transition officials and authorities performing background checks; {{she said that she}} had thought that {{the fact that they were}} sponsoring the couple for citizenship made the hiring acceptable, and that they could not pay the taxes for people who were not yet in the country legally. [...] (Baird's immigration lawyer would dispute some aspects of exactly when the sponsorship request took place.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Saint Augustine saw a {{conflict}} with Old Testament polygamy. He refrained from judging the patriarchs, but did not deduce from their practice the ongoing acceptability of polygyny. On the contrary, {{he argued that the}} polygamy of the Fathers, which was tolerated by the Creator because of fertility, was a diversion from His original plan for human marriage. Augustine wrote: [...] "That the good purpose of marriage, however, is better promoted by one husband with one wife, than by a husband with several wives, is shown plainly enough by the very first union of a <b>married</b> <b>pair,</b> which was made by the Divine Being Himself." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{cars were}} ordered from General Electric and Avco. Aside from the boxier look and smaller side windows, the main changes {{between the new}} IVs and earlier Silverliners {{included}} a dynamic brake system, for which the resistance grids were fitted in the car's signature roof hump, and, for the Penn Central cars, a trainline automatic door system which removed the need for train crew to manually open doors at high level platforms. [...] The Silverliner IVs were also {{the first to be}} delivered in a <b>married</b> <b>pair</b> configuration, although a minority of cars were outfitted as single units. The delivery of the Silverliner IVs allowed SEPTA to replace most of its remaining PRR MP54s and Reading's pre-war MU fleet save for the 38 rebuilt [...] "Blueliner" [...] cars. [...] While being fitted with an updated propulsion system from General Electric, the Silverliner IVs were nevertheless still delivered with Ignitron tube rectifiers, which were later replaced with silicon controlled rectifiers.|$|E

50|$|In US {{passenger}} railroad parlance, twin {{units are}} {{also known as}} <b>married</b> <b>pairs.</b> On passenger railroads, light rail, and monorail services, <b>married</b> <b>pairs</b> may have machinery necessary for full operation of the cars split between them. Items that are typically shared include transformers, motor controllers, dynamic braking grids, cabs, current collectors, batteries, and air compressors. This provides significant savings in both cost of equipment and weight, which increases performance and decreases energy consumption. The cost of operating such a pair may be slightly higher when the extra car in such a pair is not needed to meet level-of-service demands at a particular time.|$|R

2500|$|The cult {{image that}} is {{particular}} to Aphrodisias, the Aphrodite of Aphrodisias, doubtless was once {{housed in the}} Temple of Aphrodite. She was a distinctive local goddess who became, by interpretatio graeca, identified with the Greek Aphrodite. Her canonical image, typical of Anatolian cult images, shows that she {{is related to the}} Lady of Ephesus, widely venerated in the Greco-Roman world as Artemis of Ephesus. The surviving images, from contexts where they must have been more civic than ritual, are without exception from the late phase of the cult, in Hellenistic and Roman times. They are rendered in the naturalistic style common to their culture, which gave the local goddess more universal appeal. Like the Lady of Ephesus, the [...] "Aphrodite" [...] of Aphrodisia wears a thick, form-disguising tunic, encasing her as if in a columnar box, always with four registers of standardized imagery. Her feet are of necessity close together, her forearms stretched forward, to receive and to give. She is adorned with necklaces and wears a mural crown together with a diadem and a wreath of myrtle, draped with a long veil that frames her face and extends to the ground. Beneath her overtunic she wears a floor-length chiton. The bands of decoration on the tunic, rendered in bas-relief, evoke the Goddess's cosmic powers: the Charites, the Three Graces that are the closest attendants of Aphrodite; heads of a <b>married</b> <b>pair</b> (the woman is veiled), identified by Lisa Brody as Gaia and Uranos, Earth and the Heavens, over which this goddess reigns, rather than as Zeus and Hera; Helios and Selene separated by a pillar; the marine Aphrodite, riding a sea-goat, and at the base a group of Erotes performing cult rituals.|$|E

50|$|PATCO {{operates}} 121 67 ft cars {{which were}} acquired {{in two separate}} orders, labeled PATCO I and PATCO II.

The PATCO II cars were manufactured by Vickers Canada under a license from Budd, but are nearly indistinguishable from the PATCO I's, the only differences being that the PATCO II cars have a fixed partition behind the operator's booth and lack a stainless steel shroud below the door line to ease access to traction components.|$|R
