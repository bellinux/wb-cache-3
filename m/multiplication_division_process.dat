40|$|There {{have been}} many papers proposing the use of {{logarithmic}} numbers (LNS) {{as an alternative to}} floating point because of simpler <b>multiplication,</b> <b>division</b> and exponentiation computations [1, 4 - 9, 13]. However, this advantage comes at the cost of complicated, inexact addition and subtraction, as well as the need to convert between the formats. In this work, we created a parameterized LNS library of computational units and compared them to an existing floating point library. Specifically, we considered <b>multiplication,</b> <b>division,</b> addition, subtraction, and format conversion to determine when one format should be used over the other and when it is advantageous to change formats during a calculation. 1...|$|R
