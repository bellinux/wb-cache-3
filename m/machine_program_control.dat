The 15 <b>machine</b> computer <b>controlled</b> <b>program</b> is designed to deliver 10 left, 10 right and 5 straight-away targets to each competitor in a randomized sequence. A microphone release system is employed to provide uniformity in target release times.|$|R
40|$|A {{key issue}} in {{integrating}} process planning systems with design systems and production planning systems {{is how to}} overcome barriers in data exchange and sharing amongst software systems. Each software system has its own proprietary data format and definition, which is often not available to users. This paper presents the activity model and a machining process plan data model developed as an international product data exchange standard (ISO 10303 - 213). These two models were designed and developed to enable the integration of process planning systems with other manufacturing software systems, such as computer-aided design systems, <b>machine</b> tool <b>control</b> <b>programming</b> systems, resource management systems, production scheduling systems, and factory simulation systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of this}} bachelorÂ´s thesis describes basic attributes of the lost wax casting method. The aforementioned section describes casting stages from component assignment to model casting, with the main concern of making wax model moulds, materials employed for moulding mixtures and casting accuracy achieved by precise casting. The experimental part begins with mould design for two components set by a customer, continues with focusing on design of casting and wax model mould. This is followed with creation of the CNC <b>machine</b> <b>control</b> <b>program</b> as well as choice of the moulding mixture and finally description of such casting. The experimental section is concluded by brief description of casting test and evaluation of the quality and accuracy of cast parts...|$|R
5000|$|A key {{challenge}} for full virtualization is the interception and simulation of privileged operations, such as I/O instructions. The effects of every operation performed {{within a given}} virtual machine must be kept within that virtual machine [...] - [...] virtual operations cannot be allowed to alter the state of any other virtual <b>machine,</b> the <b>control</b> <b>program,</b> or the hardware. Some machine instructions can be executed directly by the hardware, since their effects are entirely contained within the elements managed by the <b>control</b> <b>program,</b> such as memory locations and arithmetic registers. But other instructions that would [...] "pierce the virtual machine" [...] cannot be allowed to execute directly; they must instead be trapped and simulated. Such instructions either access or affect state information that is outside the virtual machine.|$|R
40|$|Intelligent {{information}} retrieval (IIR) requires inference. The number of inferences {{that can be}} drawn by even a simple reasoner is very large, and the inferential resources available to any practical computer system are limited. This problem is one long faced by AI researchers. In this paper, we present a method used by two recent <b>machine</b> learning <b>programs</b> for <b>control</b> of inference that is relevant {{to the design of}} IIR systems. The key feature of the approach is the use of explicit representations of desired knowledge, which we call knowledge goals. Our theory addresses the representation of knowledge goals, methods for generating and transforming these goals, and heuristics for selecting among potential inferences in order to feasibly satisfy such goals. In this view, IIR becomes a kind of planning: decisions about what to infer, how to infer and when to infer are based on representations of desired knowledge, as well as internal representations of the system's inferential abilities [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim is to}} {{construct}} the original mathematical tooling for analysis of functioning industrial robot (IR) with the technical vision system (TVS), to determine by experimental and rated procedures the characteristics and parameters of the electromechanical controlling IR subsystems, to evaluate the design accuracy in the image characteristics of the TVS parts. The generalized mathematical model of the robot-technological complex on base of IR RM- 01 and binary TVS, model system of the different complexity level IR, procedure for correction of the IR positioning by means of TVS, original ripple filters of the non-linear local filtration method and also the algorithmic aids and software and TVS equipment have been developed. The functioning models and methods for design of the adaptive automation facilities with visual information processing have been applied at robotization of the assembly of the ZUBK 10 type articles on the computer-aided complex "Tulamashzavod" {{and development of the}} milling <b>machine</b> with numerical <b>programmed</b> <b>control</b> in the Design Office of Instrument Making (Tula) Available from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{modern art}} of {{computation}} has developed from plugboard programming through the stored <b>machine</b> instruction <b>programs</b> <b>controlled</b> by the users on the consoles, then to problem-oriented symbolic programs computed in the batch mode, towards the on-line computing {{during which the}} users have {{a large amount of}} <b>control</b> over their <b>programs.</b> The lower cost per computation and flexibilities of a large capacity high-speed computer naturally lead us to consider the provision of on-line computing service to several users on a single high-performance machine in a time-sharing mode, rather than several smaller machines, one for each individual. To maximize the efficiency of a man-machine team working in an on-line computing mode, it is desirable to let the man choose the language [...] -say English [...] -for communication and to let the machine do the translation. This idealistic goal is not impossible, but is currently impractical. A good compromise is to select as the user language a formal language such as ALGOL, FORTRAN or LISP which has a set of explicit syntactical rules and a small set of basic vocabulary. The user then may extend the vocabulary by declarative statements and communicate with the machine in the extended vocabulary. Due to frequent message exchanges between the man and the machine during on-line computing, the machine representation of users' programs must be easy to modify at the source language level. The technological trend towards large random access memory suggests the retention of several users' programs in core simultaneously, hence mutual memory protection must be ensured...|$|R

The paper briefly compares the generative and variant methods of automatic <b>machine</b> <b>program</b> development and then presents a technique based on the variant method where a reference <b>machine</b> <b>program</b> is transformed to machine the optimized component. The transformed <b>machine</b> <b>program</b> is examined to remove any redundant cutter motions and correct any invalid cutter motions.

40|$|Recently, the {{intelligent}} systems of technology have {{become one of}} the major items in the development of machine tools. One crucial technology is the machinery status monitoring function, which is required for abnormal warnings and the improvement of cutting efficiency. During processing, the mobility act of the spindle unit determines the most frequent and important part such as automatic tool changer. The vibration detection system includes the development of hardware and software, such as vibration meter, signal acquisition card, data processing platform, and <b>machine</b> <b>control</b> <b>program.</b> Meanwhile, based on the difference between the mechanical configuration and the desired characteristics, it is difficult for a vibration detection system to directly choose the commercially available kits. For this reason, it was also selected as an item for self-development research, along with the exploration of a significant parametric study that is sufficient to represent the machine characteristics and states. However, we also launched the development of functional parts of the system simultaneously. Finally, we entered the conditions and the parameters generated from both the states and the characteristics into the developed system to verify its feasibility...|$|R
