40|$|This essay {{discusses}} anthropological {{approaches to}} the study of media interacting with contexts of ethnic and religious diversity. The main argument is that not only issues of access to and exclusion from public spheres are relevant for an understanding of <b>media</b> and <b>pluralism.</b> Background assumptions and ideologies about media technologies and their functioning also require more comparative analysis, as they impact public spheres and claims to authority and authenticity that ultimately produce and shape scenarios of ethnic and religious diversity. This additional dimension of diversity in the question of media and ethnic and religious pluralism is particularly apparent in crises of political and religious mediation. The latter often result in desires to bypass established forms of political and religious mediation that are in turn often projected on new media technologies...|$|R

50|$|The {{concentration}} of media ownership is commonly {{regarded as one}} of the crucial aspects negatively impacting on <b>media</b> <b>pluralism.</b> A high {{concentration of}} the media market increases the chances to reduce the plurality of political, cultural and social points of views. Even if ownership of the media is one of the main concerns when it comes to assessing <b>media</b> <b>pluralism,</b> the concept of <b>media</b> <b>pluralism</b> is broader as it touches many aspects, from merger control rules to editorial freedom, the status of public service broadcasters, the working conditions of journalists, the relationship between media and politics, representation of local and regional communities and the inclusion of minorities' voices. Also, it embraces all measures guaranteeing citizens' access to diversified sources so to allow the formation of a plurality of opinions in the public sphere without undue influence of dominant powers.|$|E

40|$|In this article, we analyze {{through a}} {{political}} economy of communication lens the historical and political contexts in which the #YoSoy 132 movement emerged, the concentration of Mexican media system and the possibilities offered by social media to young people, situating the issue of media democratization at {{the centre of the}} #YoSoy 132 struggle. Drawing on two group and four individual interviews, we also focus on the dimension of students’ communication practices in order to provide a more nuanced evaluation of the role played by digital media inside the movement. By blending a political economy analysis with an exploration of media practices, we offer an in-depth understanding of how communication technologies were used and appropriated in order to democratize mainstream <b>media,</b> foster <b>pluralism</b> and trigger important processes related to political culture within the Mexican context. We conclude by assessing the achievements as well as the challenges of #YoSoy 132...|$|R

We will thus understand the role of subnational <b>media</b> in sustaining <b>pluralism</b> and in providing independent sources of information, two critical dimensions of democracy...|$|R

5000|$|Specifically, media {{ownership}} transparency {{is crucial}} for promoting <b>media</b> <b>pluralism,</b> a principle {{set forth in the}} European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which entails a positive obligation for the state to [...] "put in place an appropriate legislative and administrative framework to guarantee effective pluralism". One of the way for guaranteeing <b>media</b> <b>pluralism</b> is to ensure a wide diversity of media ownership, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for pluralism. Media ownership is also important in terms of pluralism as it might affects media outputs and contents while transparency empowers readers to detect and appraise owners influences on the media and its contents. The European Commission's study on Indicators for <b>Media</b> <b>Pluralism</b> (2009) recognises transparency of media ownership and/or control as a key indicators of <b>media</b> <b>pluralism.</b> Also, media ownership transparency is essential for preventing concentration of media power which can unduly influence public opinion and the political debate. Precisely, transparency of media ownership is a precondition for assessing levels of concentration or other dimensions of diversity in a given media system. Indeed, if readers don't know who the real owners of media companies are, it is difficult to envisage measures to address media concentrations as well as conflict of interests.|$|E
50|$|The {{case law}} of the {{regulatory}} authority regarding media concentration in Bulgaria clearly shows that further regulation and supervision are {{needed in order to}} guarantee that non-market principles, such as <b>media</b> <b>pluralism,</b> are taken into consideration in assessing transactions falling under competitive law. According to experts, effective measures for ensuring <b>media</b> <b>pluralism</b> should not be limited to self-regulation measures, but include the introduction of a body in charge of conducting non-economic analysis to assess the influence of media outlets. However, such measures are not endorsed on political level.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} how ordinary people utilize {{and assess the}} information options available to them drawing on original, nationally representative surveys conducted in 2012 in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, two regimes characterized by different trajectories since independence. In both countries, television is the main go-to source, while the Internet is used least. Trust in media, however, follows an unexpected pattern. On average, media enjoy higher levels of trust in Kazakhstan than in Kyrgyzstan, despite greater <b>media</b> independence and <b>pluralism</b> in the latter. Ironically, open political competition and media freedom in Kyrgyzstan may have a dampening effect on public trust, while in Kazakhstan limited political competition and controlled media appear to bolster it...|$|R
40|$|The first World Trends {{report in}} 2014 filled an {{important}} gap in contemporary media and communications research. While other studies and reports offered snapshots of specific dimensions or regions, UNESCO’s World Trends {{was the first}} to present a systematic trend analysis of the multiple aspects of <b>media</b> freedom, <b>pluralism,</b> independence, and safety, while giving special attention to gender-sensitive considerations. Given the success of the first World Trends report and the need for additional research, UNESCO led a second edition in the series, focusing in depth on selected digital-era trends. World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development – Special Digital Focus 2015 provides a substantive analysis of key areas identified in the first World Trends as particularly relevant for further study, namely the issues of: online hate speech, protection of journalism sources, and the role of internet intermediaries in fostering freedom of expression, as well as continued focus on the safety of journalists. It also builds on issues raised in the 2015 UNESCO study titled Keystones to foster inclusive Knowledge Societies. The current publication therefore contains four thematic chapters: 1. Countering Online Hate Speech 2. Protecting Journalism Sources in the Digital Age 3. Fostering Freedom Online: The Role of Internet Intermediaries 4. Safety of Journalist...|$|R

50|$|Concentration of media, both {{in terms}} of {{ownership}} and audience, is very high in Bulgaria. Except for the Public Service Media, no media-specific legislation regulates media ownership concentration and the issue falls within the scope of the general competition law. The Law on Radio and Television establishes only a general principle that a media licensing application must comply with the competition protection legislation. However, according to experts, this general provision proves to be inadequate. The Constitutional Court recognised <b>media</b> <b>pluralism</b> as an intrinsic part of media freedom, however “the principle of <b>media</b> <b>pluralism</b> is not respected in practice”.|$|E

50|$|Access to information, just as <b>media</b> {{independence}} and <b>pluralism</b> remain critical {{issues in the}} Republic of Moldova. Despite numerous calls for media legislation reform, the government of Moldova has not made significant steps to improve access to information according to the country's international obligations, including a convention with the Council of Europe. Public officials widely impede access to public information through refusals, delays or incomplete answers, without sanctions. In 2014, the Independent Journalism Center (IJC) presented to Parliament amendments to improve the law on access to information, provide additional guarantees for journalists and limit unjustified limitations of access to public information by public officials. However, the draft law {{has not yet been}} adopted. According to the Executive Director of the Association of Independent Press, Petru Macovei, overall the law on access to information is good, but it is compromised by a non-collaborative attitude of the public authorities.|$|R
40|$|Book synopsis: Securitising Russia {{shows the}} impact of twenty-first-century {{security}} concerns on the way Russia is ruled. It demonstrates how President Putin has wrestled with terrorism, immigration, <b>media</b> freedom, religious <b>pluralism,</b> and economic globalism, and argues that fears {{of a return to}} old-style authoritarianism oversimplify the complex context of contemporary Russia. The book focuses on the internal security issues common to many states in the early twenty-first-century, and places them in the particular context of Russia. Detailed analysis of the place of security in Russia's political discourse and policy-making reveals nuances often missing from overarching assessments of Russia today. To characterise the Putin regime as the 'KGB-resurgent' is to miss vital continuities, contexts, and on-going political conflicts which make up the contemporary Russian scene. Securitising Russia draws together current debates about whether Russia is a 'normal' country developing its own democratic and market structures, or a nascent authoritarian regime returning to the past...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of European media and {{cultural}} policy-making, the impetus to protect diversity is at least partly a reflection of recurrent concerns about concentrations of media and cross-media ownership across Europe. Such concerns have regularly spurred the European Parliament into calling on the Commission to take action. For example, in Parliament's recent response to the UNESCO initiative on Cultural Diversity, it again urged the Commission {{to take steps to}} counter concentrations of media ownership that may pose a threat to pluralism (EP, 2003). But a range of serious practical and political obstacles {{stand in the way of}} any possible harmonising initiative in this area. This article examines the European Union's efforts to work towards a pan-European policy on media ownership and the many difficulties and conflicts that have accompanied this process. It concludes that the Commission's long-standing record of inaction on the question of <b>media</b> concentrations and <b>pluralism</b> is unlikely to change any time soon...|$|R
