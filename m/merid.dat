50|$|In {{addition}} to {{the army of the}} Sidamo advancing from Sidamo Province along the Ganale Dorya River towards Dolo, the 4,000 strong army of the Bale was to advance down the Shebelle River and invade the center of Somalia.

Following the Ethiopian Revolution, in January 1975 they slipped away from Addis Ababa to organize a rebellion among peasants in Menz. Although this was not the center of their family's vast landholdings, it was only in Menz that they could obtain peasant support. Because of the area's isolation they could sell to the peasants their own interpretation of the events. They told the peasants that the Derg government was dominated by Moslems who would destroy the Ethiopian Church and take away land from Christians. As proof, the brothers played tape recorded statements of alleged government declarations broadcast over Radio Ethiopia which stated as much. Despite that their effort was doomed, it wasn't until October 1975, that security forces were able to finally track down Mesfin and <b>Merid</b> and kill them.

40|$|Abstract-Two {{approaches}} of ocean color data merging were tested and compared in the North and Equatorial Atlantic Basin: the weighted averaging and the objective analysis. The datasets used were the daily level- 3 binned data of chlorophylJ-a from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) and Moderate ReSOlution Imaging Spectroradiometer on the Aqua satellite {{over the year}} 2003, which is the liI'st common full year of opera tion. Since they represent input for both approaches, matchups between the satellite and the in situ data from the SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage System and the Atlantic <b>Merid</b> ional Transect were first studied to compute a spatial map of the root mean-square error and of the bias. Because of the log distribution of the chlorophyll fields, each approach was applied to untransformed and log-transformed values. The application of the weighted averaging to log-transformed values does not show significant differences in comparison to its application to untransformed values. This is not the case, however, for the objective analysis that gives better results when applied to log transformed values. Both approaches give combined chlorophyll data of equivalent (luality, although the objective analysis could be improved with a better statistical characterization of noise and signal covariance. The main advantage of the objective analysis {{is its ability to}} interpolate in space (and time) by taking into account the characteristic scales of chlorophyll-a. As a result, the spatial coverage of the combined data is at least twice as large in the case of objective analysis than weighted averaging.

40|$|The {{study of}} the older {{literature}} on Crustacea, from Linnaeus (1758) to H. Milne Edwards (1837), has been much neglected by modern carcinologists. A result {{of this is that}} many wrong names at present are used, especially for European species. The European species namely were most extensively studied by the older authors, while moreover {{in the middle of the}} previous century handbooks on the carcinological fauna of several parts of Europe were published (for instance Bell's (1844 - 1853) "A History of the British stalk-eyed Crustacea", and Heller's (1863) " Die Crustaceen des südlichen Europa"), which for many authors made a consultation of older works superfluous. It is astonishing to note how many names at present are used incorrectly for species of the group. The intention of the present paper is to deal with some of these nomenclatorial puzzles and to find the correct name for the species involved.

40|$|Objectives: We tested two novel {{drug-eluting}} stents (DES), {{covered with a}} biodegradable-polymer carrier and releasing paclitaxel or sirolimus, which were compared against a bare metal stent (primary objective). the DES differed by the drug, but were identical otherwise, allowing to compare the anti-restenosis effects of sirolimus versus paclitaxel (secondary objective). Background: the efficacy of novel DES with biodegradable polymers should be tested {{in the context of}} randomized trials, even when using drugs known to be effective, such as sirolimus and paclitaxel. Methods: Overall, 274 patients with de novo coronary lesions in native vessels scheduled for stent implantation were randomly assigned (2 : 21 ratio) for the paclitaxel (n = 111), sirolimus (n = 106), or bare metal stent (n = 57) groups. Angiographic follow-up was obtained at 9 months and major cardiac adverse events up to 12 months. Results: Both paclitaxel and sirolimus stents reduced the 9 -month in-stent late loss (0. 54 - 0. 44 mm, 0. 32 - 0. 43 mm, vs. 0. 90 - 0. 45 mm respectively), and 1 -year risk of target vessel revascularization and combined major adverse cardiac events (P < 0. 05 for both, in all comparisons), compared with controls. Sirolimus stents had lower late loss than paclitaxel stents (P < 0. 01), but similar 1 -year clinical outcomes. There were no differences in the risk of death, infarction, or stent thrombosis among the study groups. Conclusion: Both novel DES were effective in reducing neointimal hyperplasia and 1 -year re-intervention, compared to bare metal stents. Our findings also suggest that sirolimus is more effective than paclitaxel in reducing angiographic neointima, although this effect was not associated with better clinical outcomes.

40|$|Prenatal {{exposure}} to air pollution {{is considered to}} be associated with adverse effects on child health. This may partly be mediated by mechanisms related to DNA methylation.; We investigated associations between {{exposure to}} air pollution, using nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) as marker, and epigenome-wide cord blood DNA methylation.; We meta-analyzed the associations between NO 2 exposure at residential addresses during pregnancy and cord blood DNA methylation (Illumina 450 K) in four European and North American studies (n = 1, 508) with subsequent look-up analyses in children ages 4 (n = 733) and 8 (n = 786) years. Additionally, we applied a literature-based candidate approach for antioxidant and anti-inflammatory genes. To assess influence of exposure at the transcriptomics level, we related mRNA expression in blood cells to NO 2 exposure in 4 - (n = 111) and 16 -year-olds (n = 239).; We found epigenome-wide significant associations [false discovery rate (FDR) p < 0. 05] between maternal NO 2 exposure during pregnancy and DNA methylation in newborns for 3 CpG sites in mitochondria-related genes: cg 12283362 (LONP 1), cg 24172570 (3. 8 kbp upstream of HIBADH), and cg 08973675 (SLC 25 A 28). The associations with cg 08973675 methylation were also significant in the older children. Further analysis of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory genes revealed differentially methylated CpGs in CAT and TPO in newborns (FDR p < 0. 05). NO 2 exposure at the time of biosampling in childhood {{had a significant impact on}} CAT and TPO expression.; NO 2 exposure during pregnancy was associated with differential offspring DNA methylation in mitochondria-related genes. Exposure to NO 2 was also linked to differential methylation as well as expression of genes involved in antioxidant defense pathways.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from African Bird Club. The White-tailed Swallow Hirundo megaensis is a threatened and poorly known bird endemic to southern Ethiopia, where it is restricted to a small area of Acacia savanna. Despite the paucity of previous nest records, we found 67 nests in the years 2010 – 14, commonly in village huts lived in by people, and report the first confirmation of nesting (two certain records) in termite mounds. Its nests are small mud cups lined with grass and animal hair, fixed to roof joists and {{similar to those of}} its sister species, the Pearl-breasted Swallow H. dimidiata of southern Africa, although it appears to lay larger clutches (3 – 4 pure white eggs) and breed less frequently, producing one brood in each of its two rain-driven breeding seasons (April–June and October–November). The same nests are reportedly used in these two seasons, presumably by the same pairs. Incubation lasts 16 – 17 days, with some broods showing clearly smaller chicks and hence presumably asynchronous hatching. Study of nestlings in the hand and museum skins confirmed that juveniles can be determined by their shorter tails, browner heads and frequently also wings, and reduced white in the tail. Although birds are typically seen singly or in pairs, flocks of up to 50, sometimes mixed with other hirundines, can occur. The breeding range appears to be almost identical to that of the Ethiopian Bush-crow Zavattariornis stresemanni but regular sightings of White-tailed Swallows since 2005 at the Liben Plain, 120 km to the east of the core area, suggest that the birds are frequent visitors there.
