5|$|Chamunda Devi Temple {{is located}} in a {{prominent}} position on the spur of Shah <b>Madar</b> range of hills, opposite to the Chamba town. It was built by Raja Umed Singh, and was completed in 1762. It is the only wooden temple with gabled roof (single storied) in Chamba, while all others in the town are built from stone in the north Indian Nagara architectural style.|$|E
5|$|The town, the {{district}} and the valley where the town is located, share the name of Chamba. The town of Chamba {{is located at the}} junction of Ravi River and its tributary, the Sal River, with the Shah <b>Madar</b> hill forming the backdrop on its eastern side. The Ravi flows in east-west direction forming deep canyons. During the spring and summer months, the levels of the river rise significantly from snow melt and pose a flooding risk. Record levels were experienced in early July 2005, when the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation was forced to shut down the power generation on its 300-MW Chamera Power Station.|$|E
5|$|The old {{heritage}} monuments, {{which are}} palaces and temples {{are located in}} the old town (east of the Chaugans), on the lower slopes of Shah <b>Madar</b> hill. They were built in the lower valley where the two rivers and steep thickly forested hillsides provided a strong defense. Located here is the 10th century Champavati Temple, said to have marked the birth of the town, the Lakshmi Narayan group of temples (built from 10th-19th century), the 10th century Sita Ram Temple, Bansi Gopal temple, Kharura Mohalla and Hari Rai temple, the 11th century Sui Mata Temple and Chamunda Devi Temple, and the Akhand Chandi palace, overlooking the Chaugan, which has since been converted into a college. Additions were made to the palace {{in the form of the}} Zenana Mahal and the Rang Mahal in the 18th century. The temples built in Chamba demonstrate a strong Kashmiri influence with their stone temple architecture and temple iconography. Given their age however, only their unicellular layout with fluted pillars has been retained.|$|E

5000|$|Without a {{doubt the}} general {{layout of the}} gardens did reflect many {{descriptions}} in the Qur'an, yet {{one of the great}} strengths of early Islam, was that Muslims looked at different sources and used useful ideas and techniques from diverse sources, particularly Byzantium.

[...] Some of the forms of the gardens were based for instance on the Hagia Sophia’s atrium, which has cypresses around a central fountain, and the plantings in the mosques were given a “specifically Muslim theological interpretation”.
