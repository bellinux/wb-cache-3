At reduced pressures Fe-filled nanotubes are formed efficiently from ferrocene and C- 60.

With the introduction of Invar in carbon nanotubes it is now possible to study the physico chemical properties of these wires. Furthemore, the alloy formation notably reduces the formation of unwanted by-products such as amorphous carbon, or metal encapsulated particles.

However, {{in each of these}} applications this iron oxide shows up with different forms because their optical, electrical and magnetic properties are strongly dependent on size, shape and kind of surfactant. In this sense the control of this characteristics has long been of scientific and technological interest. In an AC magnetic field-assisted cancer therapy, e. g., from a biological point of view, the interaction of the nanoparticles with cells is critically determined by the surface properties which control their fate in biological environments. Besides the size, factors as the shape also seems to affect the cellular uptake. On the other hand, the specific absorption rate (SAR) at a fixed frequency and magnetic field, is hugely dependent on average and distribution of size, shape, crystalline anisotropy, and degree of aggregation or agglomeration of the nanoparticles.

Di(2 -ethyl hexyl) phosphoric acid {{is used as a}} model dispersant while a vinyl acetatevinyl chloride copolymer that combined the functionality of a dispersant and a binder is used as a wetting binder. A comparison of the DCON values measured at different binder levels to the tape characteristics shows that dispersions with large negative DCON signals result in good quality tapes. To study the degradation of magnetic particles, the interaction of water vapor with iron based metal particles was measured under different temperature and humidity conditions using a flow microcalorimetric (FMC) technique. Water uptake by iron based metal particles increased linearly with relative humidity ranging from 30 % to 70 % RH in the temperature range 30 °C to 70 °C. Mossbauer measurements showed that the ratio of core iron to oxide iron decreased during aging. Particles coated with hydrophobic PVC exhibited much less water uptake than particles coated with a less hydrophobic polymer, poly(vinyl alcohol). A computational investigation using the method of molecular dynamics was also undertaken to characterize the state of magnetic particle dispersions. The simulations revealed that the microstructure of the spherical particulate dispersions consists of chain-like clusters resulting from magnetic dipole alignment. Acicular particles formed clusters such as dimers, chains and rings.

40|$|Magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) {{nanoparticles}} are {{objects of}} intense research activities {{due to their}} broad range of applications covering technological, medical, and environmental applications. They are used e. g. for rotary shaft sealing, oscillation damping, position sensing, <b>magnetic</b> <b>inks</b> for jet printing, as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging, and to remove heavy metals from wastewater. In addition, magnetite is a half-metal with a predicted negative spin polarisation making magnetite interesting for spintronics. For all applications, a high quality of magnetite is crucial to obtain the desired properties. In this work, we studied {{the influence of the}} surface on the electronic and magnetic properties of magnetite nanoparticles by means of x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) and its associated magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). In particular, we investigated ensembles of magnetite nanoparticles with a mean diameter of 3 nm, 6 nm or 9 nm and the influence of capping the particles with a 3 nm thick silica shell or organic ligands. XANES and XMCD gives the unique possibility to distinguish between the three different Fe species in magnetite, i. e. tetrahedrally coordinated Fe 3 + ions, octahedrally coordinated Fe 3 +, and octahedrally coordinated Fe 2 +, by using different photon energies for hysteresis measurements. Besides changes in the electronic structure, i. e. in the density of unoccupied 3 d states monitored by XANES, and the effective spin magnetic moments, we obtained a different spin canting behaviour of Fe ions in magnetite at different lattice sites from the magnetic field dependent XMCD as shown in the figure below.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of magnetic nanoparticles {{has long been}} an area of active research. Magnetic nanoparticles {{can be used in a}} wide variety of applications such as <b>magnetic</b> <b>inks,</b> <b>magnetic</b> memory devices, drug delivery, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents, and pathogen detection in foods. In applications such as MRI, particle uniformity is particularly crucial, as is the magnetic response of the particles. Uniform magnetic particles with good magnetic properties are therefore required. One particularly effective technique for synthesizing nanoparticles involves biomineralization, which is a naturally occurring process that can produce highly complex nanostructures. Also, the technique involves mild conditions (ambient temperature and close to neutral pH) that make this approach suitable for a wide variety of materials. The term 'bioinspired' is important because biomineralization research is inspired by the naturally occurring process, which occurs in certain microorganisms called 'magnetotactic bacteria'. Magnetotactic bacteria use biomineralization proteins to produce magnetite crystals having very good uniformity in size and morphology. The bacteria use these magnetic particles to navigate according to external magnetic fields. Because these bacteria synthesize high quality crystals, research has focused on imitating aspects of this biomineralization in vitro. In particular, a biomineralization iron-binding protein found in a certain species of magnetotactic bacteria, magnetospirillum magneticum, AMB- 1, has been extracted and used for in vitro magnetite synthesis; Pluronic F 127 gel was used to increase the viscosity of the reaction medium to better mimic the conditions in the bacteria. It was shown that the biomineralization protein mms 6 was able to facilitate uniform magnetite synthesis. In addition, a similar biomineralization process using mms 6 and a shorter version of this protein, C 25, has been used to synthesize cobalt ferrite particles. The overall goal of this project is to understand the mechanism of magnetite particle synthesis in the presence of the biomineralization proteins, mms 6 and C 25. Previous work has hypothesized that the mms 6 protein helps to template magnetite and cobalt ferrite particle synthesis and that the C 25 protein templates cobalt ferrite formation. However, the effect of parameters such as the protein concentration on the particle formation is still unknown. It is expected that the protein concentration significantly affects the nucleation and growth of magnetite. Since the protein provides iron-binding sites, it is expected that magnetite crystals would nucleate at those sites. In addition, in the previous work, the reaction medium after completion of the reaction was in the solution phase, and magnetic particles had a tendency to fall to the bottom of the medium and aggregate. The research presented in this thesis involves solid Pluronic gel phase reactions, which can be studied readily using small-angle x-ray scattering, which is not possible for the solution phase experiments. In addition, the concentration effect of both of the proteins on magnetite crystal formation was studied...|$|R

30|$|Heterogeneous {{catalysis}} plays {{a crucial}} role in many areas of chemical and energy industries. Intensive studies have focused on understanding, improving, and designing new catalysts by now. Adsorption of transition metal atoms on noble metal substrate can influence the corresponding catalytic properties, {{which is one of the}} most significant topics in catalysis [1 – 7]. In particular, the adsorption of one monolayer metal on metal surface exhibits significantly different chemical and catalytic properties within various kinds of adsorbed systems [5 – 7]. In general, the catalytic properties of the materials depend on their atomic structures, composition, and the electronic states that near the Fermi level [8 – 12]. The substrate is expected to directly and/or indirectly influence the catalytic properties of metal deposits. As we all know, Cu(111) surface is one of the most thoroughly investigated single crystal metal surfaces in the past few decades [13 – 24]. Especially, in the last decade, Cu(111) surface has been considered as the most primary substrate for the growth of high-quality and large-area graphene by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [22 – 24]. The novel electronic properties of graphene can be well preserved on such a substrate. The adsorption of late 4 d transition metals (such as Rh [25], Pd [26 – 30], Ir [31], and Pt [29, 32, 33]) on the Cu(111) surface have been widely studied both experimentally and theoretically. However, the study of the early 3 d transition metal atoms adsorbed on the Cu(111) surface is relatively lacking [34 – 37]. Here, we focus on the early 3 d transition metal element, vanadium, due to its biochemical relevance and extensive applications in several industrial fields, such as heterogeneous catalysis, molecular networks, nanomaterials, and building of batteries [38]. The vanadium-based polyanion materials are proposed to be the candidates to replace the commercial cathode materials LiCoO 2 and LiMn 2 O 4 due to its flexible valence states [39]. Hence, studying the adsorption characteristics of vanadium atoms can facilitate its applications in reality. The possible applications of the systems studied can be expected as below. (1) The common oxidation states of the vanadium can be +[*] 2, +[*] 3, +[*] 4, and +[*] 5; therefore, it can be used as a powerful and versatile catalyst in nanomaterials industry [38]. (2) Vanadium in the metallic state can be used to catalyze the disproportionation of CO to C and CO 2 [40]. (3) It is also interesting to analyze the TM (i.e., vanadium) atoms adsorbed on surfaces with a weak concentration of free electrons due to the possible increasing of the electrical and thermal conduction [41]. Moreover, there is an extraordinary interest in the magnetic order in two-dimensional surface systems that can be used in recording media, <b>magnetic</b> <b>inks,</b> and spintronic devices.|$|R

The used additives are sodium hexametaphosphate, sodium oleate and polyacrylic acid. The obtained results are summurized as follows. The van der Waals' attractive force and electro-static repulsive force are significantly concerned with the apparent viscosity of slurry. Sodium hexametaphosphate has an excellent effect that it remarkably reduces the apparent viscosity of Ti 02 and Fe 203 slurries. Sodium oleate behaves to reduce the apparent viscosity of Fe 203 slurry due to the chemisorption on the Fe 203 surface...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Soft {{magnetic}} composites, {{consisting of}} fine metallic particles in a non-magnetic, insulating matrix, have {{great potential for}} integrated inductor and antenna applications. The dielectric and magnetic properties of soft magnetic composites can be tailored by the choice of matrix as well as particle composition, size, and concentration for reduction in device footprint and improvement in performance. In particular, unlike conventional single-phase materials, magnetic anisotropy in the composites can be controlled by choice of particle shape and alignment to overcome the Snoek's limit, enabling both high permeability and high ferromagnetic resonance frequency. To develop a soft magnetic composite with 1) high permeability, 2) high ferromagnetic resonance frequency, 3) low hysteresis loss, and 4) low eddy current loss, material design considerations are first examined in terms of magnetic particle design and matrix design. The effects of constituent particle shape and alignment, volume fraction, and composite shape on microstructural and magnetic properties are studied in Ni-Fe microdisk composites and NiFe₂O₄ nanocomposites. The total magnetic anisotropy of the composites {{is determined by the}} sometimes-competing influences of composite demagnetizing field and particle shape anisotropy. To lift the Snoek's limit and obtain simultaneous high permeability and high ferromagnetic resonance frequency, planar magnetic anisotropy is introduced to the composites by aligning the shape anisotropy of individual Ni-Fe microdisks in an in-plane rotating field. This planar alignment process is investigated by a systemic experimental and theoretical study of magnetic disk rotation in a Newtonian fluid, which yields insights necessary for both alignment process optimization and magnetic anisotropy fine-tuning. Finally, the magnetic alignment process is integrated to an inkjet printer, and magnetic samples with arbitrary aligned anisotropy are demonstrated by printing a <b>magnetic</b> nanoparticle bearing <b>ink...</b>|$|R
