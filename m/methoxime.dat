5000|$|Oxime {{compounds}} {{are used}} as antidotes for nerve agents. A nerve agent inactivates acetylcholinesterase by phosphorylation. Oxime compounds can reactivate acetylcholinesterase by attaching to phosphorus, forming an oxime-phosphonate, which then splits away from the acetylcholinesterase molecule. Oxime nerve-agent antidotes are pralidoxime (also known as 2-PAM), obidoxime, <b>methoxime,</b> HI-6, Hlo-7, and TMB-4. The effectiveness of the oxime treatment depends on the particular nerve agent used.|$|E
40|$|The {{potency of}} a novel oxime K 203 in reactivating soman-inhibited {{acetylcholinesterase}} and reducing acute toxicity of soman was compared with commonly used oximes (HI- 6, obidoxime, trimedoxime, <b>methoxime)</b> using in vivo methods. The study determining percentage of reactivation of soman-inhibited blood and tissue acetylcholinesterase in rats showed that the potency of the oxime K 203 to reactivate soman-inhibited acetycholinesterase in the peripheral compartment is slightly higher than obidoxime and trimedoxime, especially in the diaphragm, slightly lower than <b>methoxime</b> and markedly lower compared to the oxime HI- 6. The reactivating efficacy of the oximes studied in the peripheral compartment roughly corresponds to their potency to reduce acute toxicity of soman in mice. Based on the obtained data, we can conclude that the oxime K 203 is not suitable for {{the replacement of the}} oxime HI- 6 for the antidotal treatment of acute soman poisoning due to its relatively low potency to counteract acute toxicity of soman...|$|E

In the first part of our experiment, <b>methoxime,</b> BI- 6 or HI- 6 in combinationwith benactyzine were used for the treatment of GF-poisoned mice. In the second part of theexperiment the animals were pretreated with PANPAL 60 min before the GF-agent challengeand then the oxime therapy was applied in the same time scheme as before. All thetherapeutic regimens showed a protective ratio higher than 2 and significantly increased theLD 50 of GF-agent. The most efficacious oxime in decreasing of GF-agent toxicity was HI- 6. PANPAL increased the protective ratios of all therapeutic regimens in comparison withadministration of the oxime and BNZ alone. From the results obtained, the combination ofpretreatment with PANPAL and following therapy with BNZ and HI- 6 seems to be the mostefficacious therapeutic regimen for treatment of GF-agent-poisoned mice...|$|E

40|$|Nerve {{agents and}} {{pesticides}} {{belong to the}} group of organophosphates. They are able to inhibit irreversibly the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Acetylcholinesterase reactivators were designed for the treatment of nerve agent intoxications. Their potency to reactivate pesticide-inhibited AChE was many times evaluated. In this study, five commonly used AChE reactivators (pralidoxime, <b>methoxime,</b> HI- 6, obidoxime, trimedoxime) for the reactivation of AChE inhibited by two pesticides (chlorpyrifos and methylchlorpyrifos) were used. Russian VX (nerve agent) as a member of nerve agents’ family was taken for comparison.

It was striking that only the nitric oxide (NO) -releasing dephostatin analogs DPN and Me-DPN, but not the nitrosamine-free <b>methoxime</b> derivative (which did not release NO), enhanced TrkA phosphorylation and protected the neurons against staurosporine (STS) -induced apoptosis...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the potential of}} perfluoroacylation for gas chromatographic mass spectrometric determination of corticosteroids and related substances. Structure elucidation of the reaction products was performed with high and low resolution mass spectrometry and with proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry. Besides the well known 3 -enol ester formation, 17 β-methyl- 18 -nor- 13 (14) -ene steroids were formed via loss of the 17 -α hydroxyl group followed by a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement. Compounds that bear an 11 β-hydroxy group formed additionally a 9 (11) double bond when acetone was used as solvent, whereas acetonitrile or cyclohexane led to formation of 11 β-perfluoroacyl esters. In particular, perfluoroacylation of cortisol led to a clearly defined product instead of complex mixtures observed before, which thus makes it a valuable alternative to <b>methoxime</b> formation-silylation of cortisol for quantitative gas chromatographic mass spectrometric analyses...|$|E

Our results indicated that pralidoxime, amonoquaternary AChE reactivator, was the oxime with the most penetration. Molecular weight seems to bethe most important factor for passive transport through the BBB.

Consultant: RNDr. Dávid Maliňák, Ph. D. Title of Diploma Thesis: Synthesis {{of novel}} {{acetylcholinesterase}} reactivators of isoquinolinic type Organophosphates are worldwide {{the most common}} cause of poisoning, whether in the field of agriculture, attempted suicide, accidental contact or abuse as organophosphorus nerve agents. They can be absorbed by all paths - inhaled, ingest or by transdermal penetration. For over 50 years the only causal antidotes on the market have been acetylcholinesterase reactivators. However, bioavailability is inadequate, therapy is ineffective, and there is no broad-spectrum reactivator able to efficiently restore AChE activity after intoxication by different types of organophosphates. All available reactivators are charged oximes with one or two pyridinium rings. These are pralidoxime, <b>methoxime,</b> trimedoxime, obidoxime, HI- 6 and Hlö- 7.

Pralidoxime (2 -PAM), obidoxime, asoxime (HI- 6), trimedoxime (TMB- 4), <b>methoxime</b> (MMC), K 027 and K 203 were used as reference compounds as they {{are known to be}} able to partially reactivate paraoxon and dichlorvos inhibited AChE.

The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} organophosphorus inhibitors paraoxone, DDVP and DFP from the aspect of the kinetics of their reaction with human erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), to find IC 50, and to test the in vitro potency of five selected oximes (pralidoxime, <b>methoxime,</b> trimedoxime, obidoxime and HI- 6) to reactivate AChE and BuChE inhibited by three mentioned organophosphorus inhibitors. The inhibition of AChE and BuChE was performed by incubation with organophosphorus inhibitors at a convenient concentration and such time, that would result in about 90 % activity of an enzyme. A solution of a reactivator at a final concentration 1 μM or 10 μM was added to an enzyme, after 10 min of reactivation, a solution of a substrate - acetylthiocholine-iodide or butyrylthiocholine-iodide was added, and the activity of an enzyme was measured by the spectrophotometric Ellman's method.

Methamidophos and leptophos-oxon were quite easily reactivatable by all tested reactivators. In the case of methamidophos-inhibited AChE, the lower oxime concentration (10 − 5 M) had higher reactivation ability than the 10 − 4 M concentration. Therefore, we evaluated the reactivation ability of obidoxime in a concentration range of 10 − 3 – 10 − 7 M. The reactivation of methamidophos-inhibited AChE with different obidoxime concentrations resulted in a bell shaped curve with maximum reactivation at 10 − 5 M.

40|$|The studies {{dealing with}} {{mechanism}} of organophosphates (OP) /nerve agent action, prophylaxis {{and treatment of}} intoxications is a very hot topic at present. Though the research is very intensive, unfortunately, up to now, there is not universal or significantly better reactivator sufficiently effective against all nerve agents/OP when compared with presently available oximes (pralidoxime, <b>methoxime,</b> obidoxime, trimedoxime, HI- 6). The use {{of the most effective}} reactivator (HI- 6) using simple type of autoinjector (e. g. ComboPen) is strictly limited because of decomposition of HI- 6 in solution. Thanks to better solubility it is clear that another salt of HI- 6 (dimethanesulfonate, HI- 6 DMS) is more convenient for the use as antidote against nerve agents in the autoinjector than HI- 6 chloride (Cl). It was clearly demonstrated that reactivation potency of HI- 6 DMS in comparison with HI- 6 Cl in vivo was the same and bioavailability of HI- 6 DMS is better than that of HI- 6 Cl. Three chambered autoinjector allows administration of all three antidotes (atropine, reactivator, diazepam) simultaneously. Moreover, the content of chambers can be changed according to proposed requirements. Possible way {{to solve the problem of}} universal reactivator could be the use of two reactivators.

The avermectins and MOX have broad-spectrum activity against nematodes and arthropods. They have similar but not identical, spectral ranges of activity and some avermectins and MOX have diverse formulations for great user flexibility. The longer half-life of MOX and its safety profile, allow MOX {{to be used in}} long-acting formulations. Some important differences between MOX and avermectins in interaction with various invertebrate ligand-gated ion channels are known and could be the basis of different efficacy and safety profiles. Modelling of IVM interaction with glutamate-gated ion channels suggest different interactions will occur with MOX. Similarly, profound differences between MOX and the avermectins are seen in interactions with ABC transporters in mammals and nematodes. These differences are important for pharmacokinetics, toxicity in animals with defective transporter expression, and probable mechanisms of resistance. Resistance to the avermectins has become widespread in parasites of some hosts and MOX resistance also exists and is increasing. There is some degree of cross-resistance between the avermectins and MOX, but avermectin resistance and MOX resistance are not identical.

30|$|A {{combination}} of anticholinergic drugs, AChE reactivators (oximes), and anticonvulsants (symptomatic drugs) {{is considered the}} most promising treatment of organophosphate poisonings (Marrs, Rice, & Vale, 2006). Pralidoxime (PAM), trimedoxime (TMB 4 or TMC 4), obidoxime (LüH- 6), <b>methoxime</b> (MMB 4 or MMC 4), and HI- 6 (HI- 6 2 Cl or HI- 6 DMS) are examples of AChE reactivators available for treating OPI intoxication (Antonijevic & Stojiljkovic, 2007). However, {{there is no single}} broad-spectrum AChE reactivator with potency to activate AChE inhibited by many OP compounds, and hence, new reactivators are being still being synthesized and evaluated (Chambers et al., 2016; Chambers, Meek, & Chambers, 2016; Kliachyna et al., 2014; McHardy, Wang, McCowen, & Valdez, 2017). In order to understand the involvement of AChE inhibition in monocrotophos-induced paralysis in C. elegans, we co-incubated the worms with both monocrotophos and pralidoxime iodide (PAM), an AChE reactivator. PAM {{is one of the many}} oxime-based substances clinically used to reactivate AChE inhibited by OPI. The mechanism by which PAM activates the enzyme is based on nucleophilic attack followed by displacement of the phosphoryl group from the enzyme as the oxime-inhibitor complex (Kuca, RC, Musilek, Jun, & Pohanka, 2009). We observed that PAM rescued worms from the paralyzing effects of monocrotophos. PAM activated, albeit partially, AChE activity inhibited by monocrotophos. This further suggests that AChE inhibition is the underlying mechanism of monocrotophos-induced paralysis. More importantly, the OPI model of paralysis described in the present study utilizing paralysis as a visualizable physiological end point with AChE assay can be further developed as a good model for screening AChE reactivators.|$|E
