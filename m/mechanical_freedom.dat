40|$|Compared {{with the}} {{traditional}} actuator of machinery and electricity, the piezoelectric actuator has the advantages of a compact structure, small volume, no mechanical friction, athermancy and no electromagnetic interference. Therefore, it has high application value {{in the fields of}} MEMS, bioengineering, medical science and so on. This article draws conclusions from the influence of multiple piezoelectric effects on the physical parameters (dielectric coefficient, equivalent capacity, energy conversion and piezoelectric coefficient) of piezoelectric actuators. These data from theoretical and experimental research show the following: (1) The rate between the dielectric coefficient of piezoelectric in <b>mechanical</b> <b>freedom</b> and clamping is obtained from the secondary direct piezoelectric effect, which enhances the dielectric property, increases the dielectric coefficient and decreases the coefficient of dielectric isolation; (2) Under external field, E n (ex) = E 1, exterior stress T = 0, that is to say, under the boundary condition of <b>mechanical</b> <b>freedom,</b> piezoelectric can store electric energy and elasticity, which obtains power density, elastic density and an electromechanical coupling factor; (3) According to the piezoelectric strain S i (1), piezoelectric displacement D m (2) and piezoelectric strain S i (3) of multiple piezoelectric effects, when the dielectric coefficient of the first converse piezoelectric effect ε 33 is 1326 and the dielectric coefficient of the secondary direct piezoelectric effect increases to 3336, the dielectric coefficient of the ceramic chip increases. When the piezoelectric coefficient of the first converse piezoelectric effect d 33 is 595 and the piezoelectric coefficient of the secondary direct piezoelectric effect decreases to 240, the piezoelectric coefficient of the ceramic chip will decrease. It is of major significance both in the applications and in basic theory to research the influence of multiple piezoelectric effects on the physical parameters of piezoelectric actuators. On the one hand, this can further increase the control precision of piezoelectric actuators. On the other hand, it can be applied to research on the physical parameters and self-sensing actuators, like piezoelectric quartz and piezoelectric ceramic self-sensing actuators, which will be of great service for MEMS...|$|E

Each launcher contains two pointing mirrors with two degrees of <b>mechanical</b> <b>freedom.</b> The two flavors of motion are called facet and tilt. Therefore up to four channels of motion per launcher need to be controlled. The system utilizes absolute encoders to indicate mirror position and therefore direction of the microwave beam.

40|$|This project {{involved}} the mechanical {{design of a}} modular musical instrument, named the "Sound Strand. " Intended to be attached end-to-end one onto another {{in order to produce}} a string of music, each module was constructed to be easily maneuverable by hand and compactly contained within a 4 "x 2 "x 2 " space. The result was a module that contains three mechanical joints, which allow three separate degrees of motion within the module. A final design was achieved with a three-piece mechanism that allows Elongation, Rotation, and Bending movements. Analog potentiometers serve as the electronic tools that read the physical changes in each joint by sensing movements and outputting a voltage signal; a microcontroller with an analog-to-digital converter then transforms the electrical outputs into a digital signal, which leads to circuit boards intended to also fit within the modular space. After several iterations, the design was streamlined to optimize <b>mechanical</b> <b>freedom</b> while minimizing size, loose joints, and material used. by Yan Shen. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|A novel {{method has}} been {{developed}} to map activation in the triangle of Koch during surgery for cardiac arrhythmias and relate the map to anatomic landmarks. It uses a hand-held electrode mounted in a freely moving linkage that has three degrees of <b>mechanical</b> <b>freedom.</b> The movements of the linkage are sensed by a computer that continuously calculates the coordinates of the electrode. The surgeon clamps the device over the triangle of Koch after the right atrium has been opened and uses the electrode to trace the anatomic landmarks of the region that are displayed on the computer screen. The position of the electrode is displayed continuously relative to these landmarks and electrograms are recorded at known positions to generate a map. The activation sequences during sinus rhythm, atrioventricular node reentrant tachycardia, “common” and “uncommon” atrial flutter, long RP' tachycardia and retrograde conduction through paranodal pathways are presented. It is concluded that 1) the high spatial resolution reveals physiologically important areas in the maps that are 8 mm long and 3 mm wide and that these areas {{can be related to}} specific anatomic landmarks; 2) there are complex electrograms in the region that may reflect the activation of different myocardial layers; and 3) there are marked changes in conduction velocity and direction within the region...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a sample cell has been {{developed}} which is capable of measuring the structural variations of piezoelectric ceramic materials using low-energy X-ray scattering techniques in reflection geometry during the application of an electric field, while simultaneously collecting macroscopic strain data using a linear displacement sensor. The {{results show that the}} macroscopic strain measured using the cell can be directly correlated with the microscopic response of the material obtained from diffraction data. The electro-mechanical coupling mechanisms in polycrystalline ferroelectric materials including a soft PZT and a lead-free 0. 9375 (Bi 1 / 2 Na 1 / 2) TiO 3 - 0. 0625 BaTiO 3 (BNT- 6. 25 BT) have been contrasted using surface sensitive in situ low-energy (12. 4 keV) and bulk sensitive in situ high-energy (73 keV) synchrotron XRD during the application of electric fields. The results allow a direct comparison of the microscopic responses between the bulk grains constrained in three dimensions and the surface grains which have one dimension of <b>mechanical</b> <b>freedom.</b> It is shown that for both PZT and BNT- 6. 25 BT the intrinsic lattice strains and extrinsic non- 180 ° domain switching strains are larger at the surface than those in the bulk of the samples. The property difference is believed to result from the fact that surface grains are not constrained in three dimensions and consequently domain reorientation and lattice expansion in surface grains along the field direction occur more freely. The magnitude of the property difference between the surface and bulk is higher for PZT than for BNT- 6. 25 BT due to the magnitude of anisotropy in the strain mechanism. The comparison of the results from different methods reveals that the grain-to-grain interactions have a significant influence on the electric-field-induced electro-mechanical responses in bulk polycrystalline ferroelectrics. The structure-property relationships in a series of BNT-BT solid solutions with the BT content ranging from 5 mol% to 8 mol% in 0. 25 mol% steps were also studied using in situ high-energy synchrotron XRD. This fine compositional deference helps to make a comprehensive picture of field-induced phases particularly in the “pseudo-cubic” region of the phase diagram. Unipolar stress cycling with a maximum stress of approximately 600 MPa and bipolar electric-field cycling with a maximum field of 5 kV/mm were applied in two separate experiments. In the as-processed state, BNT- 5 BT exhibited rhombohedral crystallographic symmetry, while the rest of BNT-xBT compositions (5. 25 ≤ x ≤ 8) exhibited the pseudo-cubic symmetry. During the application of stress and electric field in two separate experiments, lower BT content samples (x = 5. 25 and 5. 5) tended to transform to rhombohedral symmetry, while the compositions with higher BT contents (7 ≤ x ≤ 8) tended to transform to tetragonal symmetry. Compositions between these (5. 5 < x < 7) tended to transform to mixed tetragonal-rhombohedral phase symmetry. The results show that the stress and electric-field-induced phase transformation mechanisms are highly analogous. Based on the results of the surface and bulk response, and the compositional dependent studies, it is suggested that the best piezoelectric performance in a polycrystalline BNT-xBT material occurs when the magnitude of anisotropy of the response mechanism is minimum. In this case, compositions which transform to a mixed phase structure are likely to have superior piezoelectric performance, as all grains in the system strain with a similar magnitude along the applied field direction. This study of field-induced strain generation mechanisms in polycrystalline piezoelectric ceramics has identified an important structural aspect which may be utilised to improve the piezoelectric properties in future developed systems...|$|E
40|$|This thesis looks {{directly}} into the controversial subject of the microwave field effect by {{the production of a}} versatile prototype isothermal microwave reactor for the investigation of enzymatic and microbiological reactions. The observed results from the prototype reactor and experiments conducted conclude that there is a nonthermal, nonlinear response between the exposure microwave power and rate and yield of cellulose saccharification. The nature of the nonthermal response is controversial and may be dependent on the definition of "nonthermal,' leading to ambiguity of exact mechanism. Enzymatic and microbial conversion of cellulosic material to ethanol is a highly desirable industrial process. Whether the demand is for the mitigation of climate change, political obligations or energy independence, the use of arable land for energy crops limits the available glucose carbon sources for conversion to bioproducts. To prevent this limitation, cellulose (~-l, 4 -linked glucose polymers) are touted as the "silver bullet" to prevent carbon exhaustion or impinging on food crops. The technical constraint for the industrialization of cellulose based processing is the rate limitation in the cellulase enzymatic action on cellulose. The enzyme rate is limited by feedback cycles and limited <b>mechanical</b> <b>freedom,</b> therefore a relatively high enzyme concentration is required to speed up the process. To date, the associated enzyme production costs and infrastructure prevents bulk volume exploitation. Biomolecular advances (amino acid substitutions, recombination of expression vectors etc) have gone some way to increase either enzymatic rate or enzyme concentration. The work presented in this thesis differs by increasing the rate of the enzyme without molecular modification. Using a microwave field, the work presented shows that by separating the system into its base units, irradiation of the enzyme/substrate complex in an aqueous environment can increase both the initial enzyme rate and the saccharification yield without alteration of the temperature set point. This study shows that the rate increase is not proportional to the microwave field power. An optimal power in each study is either found or suggested. The results cited show that in the three systems (Endoglucanase and cellobiohydrolase with cellulose, endoglucanase and cellobiohydrolase and ~- glucosidase with cellulose, and ~-glucosidase with cellobiose) the initial rates can be increased by 201 %, 65. 5 % and 69 % respectively. In the total hydrolytic process (endoglucanase and cellobiohydrolase and ~-glucosidase on a cellulose substrate) the final glucose yield was increased by 43 % in comparison to the conventional thermal control reaction. This is shown in Figure 1. 10. 000 1 9. 000 1 8. 000 j 7. 000 6. 000 o 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 I I 1 I U 5. 000 r:: o u 4. 000 3. 000 2. 000 j i t t, f 1. 000 0. 000 Time (hours) =->=OOOW Glucose' ? 012 W Glucose ?p 025 W Glucose ~ 050 W Glucose ? 075 W Glucose Figure 1. Microwave irradiated "cellulase" enzymes with cellulose substrate I For development into an industrial system and looking towards simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was subjected to irradiated microwave fermentations on a glucose substrate. Although inconclusive in terms of rate increase, cell density 1 was comparable across the power range showing that the irradiation does not have a derogatory effect. ! The natural evolution of the conclusions drawn would be development of the system into a SSF or SSCF configuration for bio-product formation is possible with irradiation up to SOW. ii The novelty of the experiments conducted is twofold. Firstly, the reactor has been designed to ensure that the microwave irradiation is independent of the bulk temperature therefore allowing the exploration of the microwave field effect independently to the thermal effect. Secondly, the microwave source is a continuous microwave irradiation (none pulse irradiation) ensuring that the reaction is subjected to the microwave field for the entire reaction...|$|E
