25|$|Each {{month of}} the Islamic {{calendar}} commences on {{the birth of the}} new lunar cycle. Traditionally this is based on actual observation of the crescent (hilal) marking the end of the previous lunar cycle and hence the previous month, thereby beginning the new month. Consequently, each month can have 29 or 30 days depending on the visibility of the moon, astronomical positioning of the earth and weather conditions. However, certain sects and groups, most notably Bohras Muslims namely Alavis, Dawoodis and Sulaymanis and Shia Ismaili Muslims, use a tabular Islamic calendar (see section below) in which odd-numbered months have thirty days (and also the twelfth <b>month</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> leap year) and even months have 29.|$|E
25|$|Larramendi {{refused to}} join Francoist {{structures}} and criticized those who did; he verbally assaulted Julio Muñoz Aguilar, co-editor from La Voz de España, for an article supporting Franco.

The work was an orthodox lecture of political Traditionalism, stemming from assumption that traditionalist system {{does not need to}} be implemented: it exists as a natural phenomenon. It is not clear whether Larramendi hoped to get the work published; it was not possible before 1952, when it went to print as Cristiandad, Tradición y Realeza.

25|$|Rabbinic {{tradition}} ascribes to him an enactment {{which proved}} of incalculable benefit to his coreligionists {{of his own}} and of subsequent generations. The Jewish calendar is lunisolar. That is, its months are synchronized with the phases of the moon, but its average year length approximates the mean length of a solar year. The purpose of the latter is to ensure that the festivals, all of which occur on fixed dates of the lunar months, are also observed each year in the seasons designated for them in the Bible. To ensure the former, occasional intercalations of a day in a month were required; to ensure the latter, occasional intercalations of an extra <b>month</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> year were required.|$|E
