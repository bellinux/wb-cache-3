40|$|ABSTRACT: The process {{developed}} in the U K to produce magnesium hydroxide from seawater is described, together with the heat reatment that he hydroxide r ceives toproduce the active oxide. Some of the characteristics required of the dolomite used in the process are also discussed. Impurities introduced by the seawater a e noted and {{the means by which}} they can be reduced explained. Magnesium oxide has long been an important industrial material. The major tonnage outlet for magnesia has been the refractories industry in which it is employed as 'dead-burned' grain magnesite for the construction and maintenance of the hearths or bottoms of open-hearth steel furnaces. Magnesia also is used in the form of calcined refractory <b>magnesite</b> <b>brick</b> and as a chemical addition in the manufacture of chrome, olivine and other refractories. The industrial importance of magnesia is due to its chemical behaviour and this is largely determined by the position of magnesium in the periodic table. Magnesium oxide is a weak base, particularly at high temperatures, and therefore magnesium oxide is barely attacked by alkalis but readily by acids. All strong mineral acids dissolve or corrode magnesiu...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} new {{refractories}} for copper converters is addressed in this thesis. Penetration resistance is viewed as the first property that must be evaluated for the selection of new refractories since {{it is known that}} melt penetration can promote or enhance the main wear mechanisms in copper converters: dissolution, erosion and spalling. Thus, a penetration test was designed where it is possible to control the oxygen potential and the "in-situ" formation of converter melts by injecting a mixture of inert gas and oxygen according to thermodynamic calculations. Initially, the effects of oxygen potential and matte grade on three different refractories (burned magnesite chrome brick, burned spinel bonded <b>magnesite</b> <b>brick</b> and spinel direct bonded) were studied using the operating conditions of copper converters. This allowed the selection of a potential candidate, the spinel direct bonded brick. Subsequently, the effect of time, temperature and melt composition on the penetration resistance of this candidate was studied and compared with the current refractory used in copper converter, namely burned magnesitechrome brick. The reactions occurring at the refractory pill-interface, the mechanisms and kinetics of penetration and the differences in performance were determined. In addition the mechanism of dissolution and penetration of magnetite coatings applied into basic refractories were elucidated since it is considered important when proposing new solutions and alternative refractories to avoid or reduce wear in copper converters...|$|E
40|$|During the {{production}} of steel in the LD converter the refractory lining is exposed to high temperature emulsion of steel, slag and gas. It protects the steel body of the vessel to {{come in contact with}} the molten steel. The main purpose of this work was to observe the temperature distribution profile in converter refractory lining which is very important to understand the life of the refractory lining of the LD converter. In this study, a three dimensional (3 D) heat transfer model for the refractory lining of converter was developed. The lining of the refractory material was considered as <b>magnesite</b> <b>brick</b> for inner lining, dolomite for intermediate lining and steel shell as outer part. In order to do the numerical modeling, the CFD software Ansys Fluent 13. 0 was used. After considering the proper dimensions, meshing, properties of the lining material and boundary conditions, the modeling in Ansys was performed in two stages. In the first stage, the modeling was performed by assuming that the converter is already heated and the inside temperature of the furnace is 1923 K and the outside temperature of the steel body is 300 K. In the second stage, the temperature change of the molten steel, slag and the gas was considered as function of blowing time and slag height based on theories from different references. Firstly, the three dimensional (3 D) heat transfer model was used for the refractory lining of the converter to show transient heat flow through the lining at different times. Secondly, 3 D modeling results from fluent 13. 0 was used to develop temperature distribution profile through the lining at different height for different time steps and at different positions with time and also along the converter height from the bottom to top. It has been noticed that refractories in the lining in contact with steel and slag must be of good quality for the reduction of wear cost and downtime and therefore the reduction of refractory cost per ton of steel production...|$|E
25|$|Crucibles {{began using}} very large flake graphite, and carbon-magnesite brick {{requiring}} {{not quite so}} large flake graphite; for these and others there is now much more flexibility in size of flake required, and amorphous graphite is no longer restricted to low-end refractories. Alumina-graphite shapes are used as continuous casting ware, such as nozzles and troughs, to convey the molten steel from ladle to mold, and carbon <b>magnesite</b> <b>bricks</b> line steel converters and electric-arc furnaces to withstand extreme temperatures. Graphite blocks are also used in parts of blast furnace linings where the high thermal conductivity of the graphite is critical. High-purity monolithics are often used as a continuous furnace lining instead of carbon-magnesite bricks.|$|R
40|$|Australians {{are among}} the world’s largest human per capita {{contributors}} to carbon dioxide emissions. In 2008 the most populous state of NSW accounted for 158. 2 Mt of these emissions, with 76 Mt of NSW emissions from stationary sources, such as power plants. NSW has not located adequate porous and permeable sedimentary basins to sequester carbon dioxide in underground reservoirs. Mineral carbonation is an alternative method of reducing emissions of CO₂ by chemical reaction with magnesium or calcium-bearing rocks to form insoluble carbonates, which bind CO₂ {{in a form that}} is stable over geological time. Current methods seek to replicate the natural weathering process of silicate rocks such as peridotite and serpentinite to form carbonates such as magnesite, but reduce the time for the carbonation reaction to proceed. New processing approaches focus on environmentally sustainable aqueous reactions which eliminate the use of acids, and biodissolution of reactants or precipitation of products using bacteria, which would reduce the energy penalty. Value-added byproducts which could offset costs include magnesite, magnetite, silica, heat, nickel and chromite. Refractory <b>magnesite</b> <b>bricks</b> are currently used for a variety of steel-making and other furnaces, and potentially for insulated housing. The aim is to approach the estimated cost of geosequestration,which is possibly grossly underestimated due to inherent variability of each individual basin. Mineral carbonation should be evaluated in NSW, and other countries where geosequestration is a less than viable option in the short term. The mineral carbonation process represents a stable solution to storing carbon dioxide, without risk of leakage, without the need for monitoring and with the promise of products which will make the process economically viable...|$|R
