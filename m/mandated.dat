5|$|As {{the result}} of the {{accidents}} in the 1970s and 1980s, most notably following the 1985 crash of Delta Air Lines Flight 191, in 1988 the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration <b>mandated</b> that all commercial aircraft have on-board wind shear detection systems by 1993. Between 1964 and 1985, wind shear directly caused or contributed to 26 major civil transport aircraft accidents in the U.S. that led to 620 deaths and 200 injuries. Since 1995, the number of major civil aircraft accidents caused by wind shear has dropped to approximately one every ten years, due to the <b>mandated</b> on-board detection as well as the addition of Doppler weather radar units on the ground (NEXRAD). The installation of high-resolution Terminal Doppler Weather Radar stations at many U.S. airports that are commonly affected by wind shear has further aided the ability of pilots and ground controllers to avoid wind shear conditions.|$|E

40|$|We {{have now}} tested the Finch Committee's Hypothesis that Green Open Access <b>Mandates</b> are {{ineffective}} in generating deposits in institutional repositories. With data from ROARMAP on institutional Green OA <b>mandates</b> and data from ROAR on institutional repositories, {{we show that}} deposit number and rate is significantly correlated with <b>mandate</b> strength (classified as 1 - 12) : The stronger the <b>mandate,</b> the more the deposits. The strongest <b>mandates</b> generate deposit rates of 70 %+ within 2 years of adoption, compared to the un-mandated deposit rate of 20 %. The effect is already detectable at the national level, where the UK, which has the largest proportion of Green OA <b>mandates,</b> has a national OA rate of 35 %, compared to the global baseline of 25 %. The conclusion is that, contrary to the Finch Hypothesis, Green Open Access <b>Mandates</b> do have a major effect, and the stronger the <b>mandate,</b> the stronger the effect (the Liege ID/OA <b>mandate,</b> linked to research performance evaluation, being the strongest <b>mandate</b> model).

40|$|There are {{numerous}} ecosystem {{goods and services}} (EGS) provided by the ocean. There are also multiple <b>mandates</b> to address this suite of EGS. Which facets of the ocean EGS does this portfolio of <b>mandates</b> collectively address? How are these <b>mandates</b> interrelated? Are there gaps in their coverage of EGS? Are there areas of reinforcement? To elucidate this set of issues, we characterize the portfolio of <b>mandates</b> that a leading U.

We link these <b>mandates</b> to a suite of EGS, evaluating the relative degree that each <b>mandate</b> addresses each EGS. The weighted overlap across <b>mandates</b> with respect to EGS was also estimated. Of the nearly 100 NOAA <b>mandates,</b> and the subset of 50 NOAA-Fisheries <b>mandates,</b> there was broad coverage of ocean EGS; every EGS has at a minimum of 9 NOAA <b>mandates</b> that addressed that topic. Food production, habitat provision, genetic resources, recreation, tourism, historical and heritage value, and knowledge and science value were the EGS that had the highest amount of coverage at 30, 42, 50, 39, 38, 34, and 60 NOAA <b>mandates,</b> respectively. There was some reinforcement across <b>mandates,</b> particularly for the top EGS, suggesting that the multiple facets of these EGS are being reasonably well addressed. Seventy percent of <b>mandates</b> informed the same EGS via implementation of the top 10 <b>mandates</b> considered {{to be the most important}} for NOAA.

40|$|Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) aims {{to support}} {{investment}} in cellulosic biofuel refineries by <b>mandating</b> a floor {{on the amount}} of biofuels being consumed in every calendar year. Tradable Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) is the market mechanism by which the <b>mandates</b> are to be met. But the RFS allows for a waiver of the <b>mandates.</b> In this paper we construct a conceptual model to study the impact of RINs on stimulating investment in cellulosic biofuel refineries under a waivable <b>mandate.</b> In a two-period framework, we compare the first-period investment level in three scenarios: (1) laissez-faire, (2) non-waivable <b>mandate</b> implemented through RINs, and (3) waivable <b>mandate</b> implemented through RINs. We find that RINs associated with a waivable <b>mandate</b> may or may not increase the first-period investment level depending on the price distribution of cellulosic biofuel in the future and the cost of biofuel production. Under certain conditions about the second-period price distribution of cellulosic biofuels, RINs, no matter under a non-waivable <b>mandate</b> or under a waivable <b>mandate,</b> do not affect the investment level in the first period. If these distribution conditions do not hold and investors' marginal costs are constant, then a non-waivable <b>mandate</b> can increase the period one investment level but a waivable <b>mandate</b> will not. A waivable <b>mandate,</b> even when it has no impact on the period-one investment level, always increase the expected profit of investors who invest in the first period.
