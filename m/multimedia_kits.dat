40|$|In education, a {{delivery}} {{system is the}} organizational approach the instructor uses to deliver, organize, present, or communicate his/her instructional message or topic to the learners (Dick and Carey, 1996) 1. The four most common delivery systems are non-projected media, projected visuals, audio, and video. All four delivery systems {{may be used in}} all three types of instruction. The three types of instruction are as follows: • Instructor-led instruction is the traditional education approach where the student attends a classroom to receive face-to-face instruction from the instructor. • The self-instructional delivery system, also known as packaged instruction, is where face-to-face instruction is combined with a <b>multimedia</b> <b>kit</b> allowing the student to learn at his or her own pace. Distance education is where the instructor and student are separated by distance allowing for synchronous (live instruction and listening at a specific time) and asynchronous (non-live instruction) learning.

40|$|Introduction: Animations are {{the best}} suited to convey and create an impact of an idea or concept in media business. Animations are {{sequential}} frames of pictures shown across this fourth dimension, namely "time. " Cartoons {{are the best}} examples of animations; needless to say, animations grab the attentions of every one. Animations can also be effectively used in medical education especially in teaching human embryology. It communicates of a concept of three-dimensional structures against one more dimension, namely time. However, to create a module of animation, knowledge, and operative skills of animation software like Flash®, Author ware®, Macromedia® or other high-ended software is necessary. Aim: To design simple, user-friendly and easy to make an effective animation using one of the office tools of Windows®, Power Point®. Materials and Methods: A personal computer with following configuration was used. Pentium III processor with 1. 3 Gz speed, 40 GB HDD, 128 MB RAM, with <b>multimedia</b> <b>kit,</b> key pad, and scroll mouse was used. Programs used were Power Point® and MS Paint®. A screen play of sequences of diagrams was written. Frames consisting of diagrams of stages of development were drawn in MS Paint®, and were pasted in PowerPoint slides and animation tool was applied. Previewing was done at every stage. Results: Stages of development of storyboard have been shown as print screen images, 1 - 6. Conclusion: Emphasis is that such simple animations can be easily made. It is cheap and does not require any sophisticated software. However, it is time consuming but can be taken up as phased assignments or can be given as undergraduate student projects.

40|$|Wonderwise 4 -H: Women in Science {{introduces}} {{youth to}} contemporary female scientists in their labs, {{out in the}} field, and with their families through nine interactive <b>multimedia</b> <b>kits.</b> Youth learn about the scientist’s occupation and participate in hands-on science activities similar to the actual work of a female scientist role model. Using role models was effective in improving youths’ attitudes about science through engaging activities and realistic videos. A web survey of 150 adult youth leaders showed Wonderwise 4 -H brings “real science” into youths’ lives by (a) engaging them in actual scientific activities, (b) increasing their understanding of what science is, and (c) broadening their view of who scientists are, what they do, and where they work. It encourages youth to pursue science in their future by (a) helping them become more confident and capable at scientific endeavors, (b) increasing {{their understanding of the}} possibilities of a science career, and (c) connecting them in a personal way with scientist role models. Wonderwise 4 -H is a model for how museums and 4 -H can work together to improve nonformal science education; 4 -H took advantage of a unique opportunity, and the museum reached beyond its usual constituents. Project dissemination was primarily through existing 4 -H networks in partner states. The success of this project suggests that opportunities for science learning can be enhanced through innovative collaborations of nonformal educational partners...|$|E
40|$|Background - Young {{children}} in military families {{with a member}} who has a life changing injury can experience emotional difficulties and behavior changes. Objective - This study evaluated a Sesame Workshop <b>multimedia</b> <b>kit</b> called: Talk, Listen, Connect: Changes (TLC-II(C); 2008). The kit, which included video and print materials, aimed to help caregivers (i. e., at-home partner, at-home relative or family member of a current or discharged military member) assist young children as they adjusted to their parent's injury. We expected that the materials would be used and their quality evaluated. We hypothesized that use of the materials would produce improvements in caregiver and child outcomes as well as reductions in perceptions of disruption in the home. We also predicted that kit-use would {{have a positive impact}} on the family. Methods - One-hundred and fifty three families with children aged 2 – 8 years were randomly assigned to receive the kit being evaluated (TLC-II(C)) or a control kit (Healthy Habits for Life (HHL)), also developed by Sesame Workshop. Group outcomes were compared four weeks following receipt of the kits using multivariate analysis of variance. Results - All materials were well used and highly rated. All caregivers reported less social isolation, less child aggression, and significantly less disruptive home environments after kit use. Test group caregivers reported significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms and significant increases in children's social competence over time in comparison to the control group. Conclusions - These results signal important improvements among families as a consequence of using either test or control materials. As a preventative intervention designed for families with an injured member, TLC-II(C) was particularly effective at improving coping...|$|R
