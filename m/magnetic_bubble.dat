40|$|Unidirectional {{magnetic}} domain-wall {{motion is}} a key concept underlying next-generation application devices. Such motion has been recently demonstrated by applying an alternating magnetic field, resulting in the coherent unidirectional motion of <b>magnetic</b> <b>bubbles.</b> Here we report the optimal configuration of applied magnetic field for the magnetic bubblecade, the coherent unidirectional motion of <b>magnetic</b> <b>bubbles,</b> driven by a tilted alternating magnetic field. The tilted alternating magnetic field induces asymmetric expansion and shrinkage of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>bubbles</b> {{under the influence of}} the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, resulting in continuous shift of the bubbles in time. By realizing the magnetic bubblecade in PtCoPt films, we find that the bubblecade speed is sensitive to the tilt angle with a maximum at an angle, which can be explained well by a simple analytical form within the context of the domain-wall creep theory. A simplified analytic formula for the angle for maximum speed is then given as a function of the amplitude of the alternating magnetic field.

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} the magnetic effects {{that may occur}} in rapidly rotating core collapse supernovae. We consider effects from both magnetic turbulence {{and the formation of}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>bubbles.</b> For <b>magnetic</b> turbulence we have made a perturbative analysis for our spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova model that incorporates the build up of magnetic field energy in the matter accreting onto the proto-neutron star shortly after collapse and bounce. This significantly modifies the pressure profile and increases the heating of the material above the proto-neutron star resulting in an explosion even in rotating stars that would not explode otherwise. Regarding <b>magnetic</b> <b>bubbles</b> we show that a model with a modest initial uniform magnetic field and uniform angular velocity of ~ 0. 1 rad/s can form <b>magnetic</b> <b>bubbles</b> due to the very non homologous nature of the collapse. It is estimated that the buoyancy of the bubbles causes matter in the proto-neutron star to rise, carrying neutrino-rich material to the neutron-star surface. This increases the neutrino luminosity sufficiently at early times to achieve a successful neutrino-driven explosion. Both magnetic mechanisms thus provide new means for initiating a Type II core-collapse supernova. Comment: 12 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

The dynamics of these systems is studied with the goal of seeing how their topological structure might arise and unravel. Monolayer bubbles evolve in time, while <b>magnetic</b> <b>bubbles</b> do not; we show that this is due to a symmetry breaking in the interactions that form the domains. We propose the Gibbs-Thompson effect as responsible for this breaking in monolayers, and show that it induces a dynamics which is, to lowest order, von Neumann's law. ...|$|R

40|$|It was {{recently}} realized that topological spin textures do not merely have mathematical beauty {{but can also}} give rise to unique functionalities of magnetic materials. An example is the skyrmion—a nano-sized bundle of noncoplanar spins—that {{by virtue of its}} nontrivial topology acts as a flux of magnetic field on spin-polarized electrons. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy recently emerged as a powerful tool for direct visualization of skyrmions in noncentrosymmetric helimagnets. Topologically, skyrmions are equivalent to <b>magnetic</b> <b>bubbles</b> (cylindrical domains) in ferromagnetic thin films, which were extensively explored in the 1970 s for data storage applications. In this study we use Lorentz microscopy to image magnetic domain patterns in the prototypical magnetic oxide–M-type hexaferrite with a hint of scandium. Surprisingly, we find that the <b>magnetic</b> <b>bubbles</b> and stripes in the hexaferrite have a much more complex structure than the skyrmions and spirals in helimagnets, which we associate with the new degree of freedom—helicity (or vector spin chirality) describing the direction of spin rotation across the domain walls. We observe numerous random reversals of helicity in the stripe domain state. Random helicity of cylindrical domain walls coexists with the positional order of <b>magnetic</b> <b>bubbles</b> in a triangular lattice. Most unexpectedly, we observe regular helicity reversals inside skyrmions with an unusual multiple-ring structure. ...|$|R

5000|$|The ESA Cluster {{mission has}} enabled {{to find the}} first direct {{evidence}} of cross-scale energy transport between fluid and ion-scale waves, explaining why Earth's magnetic environment is so hot. A Nature Physics paper reveals. The Earth's internal magnetic field creates a giant protective bubble called the magnetosphere, necessary for life to develop. This <b>magnetic</b> <b>bubble</b> helps deflecting more than 99% of the incoming solar wind expelled by the Sun. Due to this interaction, the magnetosphere has a bullet-like shape (see left panel of Figure 1). At its border, the magnetopause, the matter, called plasma, is 50 times hotter inside the Earth's magnetic environment than just outside; a problem that has puzzled scientists {{since the beginning of}} the space age. Why is Earth's environment so hot? How plasma gets heated in a medium where no particles collides? One of the few physical processes enabling solar wind plasma to enter the magnetosphere is called the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. This instability is ubiquitous in space and on Earth. Such K-H waves have been detected in various media including the surface of oceans, in clouds (see bottom right panel of Image 1), in the solar corona (see top right panel) or in the atmosphere of giant planets. Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) waves can form at Earth's magnetopause, mainly due to the velocity difference between the plasma flowing outside at higher speed than inside the magnetosphere. Back in 2004, the multi-spacecraft Cluster mission revealed that these waves can roll-up, turning into giant vortices of about 36,000 km size, i.e. about 6 times the Earth's radius (Hasegawa et al., 2004). A new article, published in Nature Physics this month, presents a detailed study of small-scale (ion-scale) wave packets captured by Cluster within such a macroscopic (fluid-scale) Kelvin-Helmholtz vortex. This study reveals for the first time that these wave packets in the eye of the vortex are magnetosonic waves with sufficient energy to account for the observed level of ion heating. In other words, these waves can heat the cooler ions of magnetosheath origin; magnetosheath is the boundary layer located just outside the magnetopause. These observations may be evidence for cross-scale energy transport in space plasmas. It may have universal consequences in understanding the energy transport from fluid to ion scales, and can play a role in a variety of plasma systems with a velocity shear.|$|E
