40|$|Abstract This study {{describes}} {{changes in}} the trophic status of 12 lakes within Suwałki Landscape Park (SLP). All of the trophic classifications of the lakes {{were based on the}} trophic continuum division. Trophic status was determined by means of multiparameter indices using several diverse criteria. In this study, the assess-ment of the trophic status of lakes included water qual-ity; abundance and biomass of bacterioplankton, phyto-plankton, and zooplankton; and primary production of phytoplankton. The Carlson trophic state index (TSI) describes the level of water fertility and indicated the dominance of moderately eutrophic waters. Lakes Perty, Jeglówek, and Hańcza have a trophic status that indi-cates <b>mesotrophy</b> (TSI < 50). The trophic status of the studied lakes was determined based on the bacterial abundance and clearly showed a lack of oligotrophic lakes in SLP. Based on the number of bacteria, only Lake Szurpiły can be classified as β-mesotrophic, whereas Lake Linówek can be characterized as hyper-trophic with some features typical for humic waters. The greatest value of gross primary production was observed in Lake Linówek (126. 4 mg C/m 3 /h). The phytoplank-ton trophy index varied from 1. 59 to 2. 28, and its highest value, which indicated eutrophy, was deter-mined for Lake Udziejek. In the case of Lakes Hańcza, Szurpiły, Perty, Jeglówek, and Kojle, the index ranged from 1. 25 to 1. 74, which indicated <b>mesotrophy.</b> The majority of the lakes were classified as mesoeutrophic (1. 75 – 2. 24).

For each sampled lake, zooplankton was collected and environmental parameters were obtained (conductivity, total dissolved solids, and chlorophyll concentration). A null model of species co-occurrence was applied to determine randomness in species associations. All sites revealed low species richness (< 6); the calanoid copepod Boeckella gracilis Daday, 1902 was present in all sites.

The analysis based on in-situ samples upstream to downstream (Puhekou, Jiajia'an, Yanziyu Panjiakou and Baqian) showed that three harmful algae species of Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta prevail in the reservoir.

40|$|Potamothrix vejdovskyi is one {{of several}} alien Ponto-Caspian species {{presently}} invading Europe and the New World. Its invasive success has been suggested to be dependent upon the trophic degree of the water, and this species is considered to be particularly indicative of <b>mesotrophy</b> (Lang & Reymond 1996). Bottom fauna surveys performed by the Swedish Fisheries Board in 1915 and 1916 and in 1933 – 1935 did not reveal the existence of P. vejdovskyi in Lake Mälaren, whereas extensive bottom fauna programs in the lake in 1967 – 1976 demonstrated a wide distribution of the species in the central, least polluted basins. Strict quantifications of the distribution of oligochaetes in those basins in 1974 showed that P. vejdovskyi then made up on average 28 % of the total abundance of oligochaetes. However, in later bottom fauna surveys in Lake Mälaren, performed by the Swedish Environment Protection Agency in 1981 and in 2009 – 2011), P. vejdovskyi could not be found at all.

40|$|Lakes Findley, Chester Morse and Sammamish, Washington, are {{characterized}} by one major outburst of phytoplankton productivity and biomass (mainly diatoms) with usually no or low fall activity. Vernal outbursts were often delayed in some lakes and years probably by unfavorable climate (snow cover and cloudy rainy conditions). Mean spring-summer productivity ranged from 270 mgC/m² day in the most oligotrophic lake, Findley, to nearly 1000 mgC/m² day in mesotrophic-eutrophic Lake Sammamish. The range in mean Chlorophyll a content was 0. 8 to 10 ug/l for the same lakes respectively. Mean biomass within and between the lakes was related to winter phosphorus content but not to nitrogen. However, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were simultaneously limiting productivity increase in the three lakes in summer. Carbon assimilation in response to added P showed increasing half-saturation constants for the natural phytoplankton progressing from oligotrophy to eutrophy. While diversion of over 1 / 2 the phosphorus from nearby Lake Washington during 1963 - 1967 was followed by reduction in winter mean P content and a rapid shift from eutrophy to <b>mesotrophy</b> (Edmondson 1970), mean winter P content and measured characteristics of plankton response have not changed significantly in Lake Sammamish following a diversion of similar magnitude.

40|$|Certain {{members of}} the bryozoan genus Celleporaria form large, erect colonies of hollow {{branches}} (; 10 – 30 cm tall and 1 – 3 cm diameter). These are common and conspicuous in Pleistocene and Cenozoic neritic strata of the southern mar-gin of Australia. Most of these basins are characterized by decimeter-scale cycles through subtidal, heterozoan, cool-water, carbonate sediments. Several intervals are further characterized by pervasive celleporarid bryozoan thickets (10 – 30 cm thick), individual units {{of which can be}} traced for many tens of kilometers. Study of modern, live celleporarid bryozoans from the continental shelf of the Great Australian Bight (GAB), Pleistocene celleporarid mounds stranded below the shelf break of the Australian margin, and Miocene celleporarid thickets from the Murray and Torquay Basins indicates that Celleporaria thickets form under specific environmen-tal conditions: i. e., low-energy or sub-swell wave-base set-tings, mud-silt substrate, medium-high <b>mesotrophy,</b> and moderate sedimentation rate. These conditions, however, are not site specific. They are manifested here in two different environmental settings: (1) a deep-water (. 200 m), upwell-ing nutrient source, below the shelf break during extreme sea-level low stands; and (2) shallow-water (, 50 m), terres-trial nutrient source, in embayments, far inland from the shelf break during relative high stands of sea-level. The celleporarid growth habit (species specific—not an ecomorph) allows their populations to proliferate in spatial-ly restricted, transitional, geologically short-lived environ-ments where most other bryozoans cannot cope. Their envi-ronmental sensitivity means that Celleporaria have great potential for paleoenvironmental analysis of Cenozoic car-bonate Tethyan sediments...|$|E

All three of these lakes have trophic states between oligotrophic and mesotrophic and the euphotic depth exceeds the mixing depth in each case. In terms of density gradient stratification, tropical and temperate lakes are in a similar range and {{the position of the}} deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) in upper hypolimnion. At the level of DCM light intensities of about 1 % of subsurface irradiation are characteristic and can suffice the light demand of shade adapted species. Availability of phosphate-P was higher int he hypolimnia of the investigated lakes, therefore this can be a selective advantage for DCM populations. Although upper hypolimnia are rather stable habitats that, in theory, would allow the best adapted species to exclude all others, cyanoprokaryotic DCM can be bi- or multispecific. In multispecific DCM, weather-driven irregularities in the stability of the pycnocline might maintain a multispecific DCM assemblage. Co-dominance of Cyanobium and Planktothrix in Lake Stechlin probably exhibited a stable co-existence when one of the species was limited by light and the other by the availability of P.

This study is aimed at assessing the trophic status of lakes by monthly sampling of three lakes located along the floodplain of Cross River, Nigeria between January 2008 and December 2009. Samples were analyzed for water quality parameters, zooplankton and phytoplankton composition and distribution. Results were subjected to community structure analysis using trophic state index, species richness and diversity indexes. Essential primary productivity nutrients, nitrates, sulphates and phosphates were highest in Ejagham Lake, and lowest in Ikot Okpora Lake. Dominant phytoplankton species Oscillatoria lacustria (Cyanophyceae), Cyclotella operculata (Bacilliarophyceae) and zooplankton Keratella tropica, Keratella quadrata, Filinia longiseta, Branchionus anguillaris and Trichocerca pusilla (rotifers) all typical of eutrophic communities were recorded in high densities in Ejagham Lake in {{both dry and wet}} seasons while Cladocerans, Bosmina longirostris and Moina micrura and copepods considered indicators of oligotrophy and <b>mesotrophy</b> were recorded in large numbers in Ikot Okpora and Obubra Lakes respectively.

Data were collected on board the R/V Hannibal during July 2005. Distinct water masses were identified using cluster analysis of temperatureesalinity (TeS) characteristics. Three major clusters appeared based on the combined effects of temperature and salinity. The first cluster was identified as the cool and less salty bottom Modified Atlantic Water (MAW). The warmer and saltier Mediterranean Mixed Water (MMW) represented the second cluster. The third cluster was the Transition Water (TW) separating the two previous clusters. The pigment and taxonomic composition of these water masses were examined. Chlorophyll a was rather low (< 200 ng l 1). Chlorophyll b was generally the most abundant accessory pigment and fucoxanthin dominated the accessory pigments in the MAW. Proportions of chlorophyll a associated with different phytoplankton classes were estimated using CHEMTAX software, and did not present significant variations among water groups. The results pointed out variations in the relative contribution of each phytoplankton taxa in each station group. Chlorophytes and prasinophytes accounted for 65 % of chlorophyll a in the MMW. Diatoms and chlorophytes were relatively abundant in the MAW contributing to almost 63 % of chlorophyll a. An unstructured community, slightly dominated by prasinophytes, chlorophytes and cryptophytes, characterised the TW. Different trophic statuses were observed in these water masses, the MMWand the MAWbeing characterised by <b>mesotrophy,</b> while an oligotrophy was observed in the TW.

40|$|Along the French Mediterranean coast, {{a complex}} of eight lagoons {{underwent}} intensive eutrophication over four decades, mainly related to nutrient over-enrichment from continuous sewage discharges. The lagoon complex displayed a wide trophic gradient from <b>mesotrophy</b> to hypertrophy and primary production was dominated by phytoplankton communities. In 2005, the implementation of an 11 km offshore outfall system diverted the treated sewage effluents leading to a drastic reduction of anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus into the lagoons. Time series data have been examined from 2000 to 2013 for physical, chemical and biological (phytoplankton) variables of the water column during the summer period. Since 2006, total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations as well as chlorophyll biomass strongly decreased revealing an improvement in lagoon water quality. In summertime, the decline in phytoplankton biomass was accompanied by shifts in community structure and composition that {{could be explained by}} adopting a functional approach by considering the common functional traits of the main algal groups. These phytoplankton communities were dominated by functional groups of small-sized and fast-growing algae (diatoms, cryptophytes and green algae). The trajectories of summer phytoplankton communities displayed a complex response to changing nutrient loads over time. While diatoms were the major group in 2006 in all the lagoons, the summer phytoplankton composition in hypertrophic lagoons has shifted towards green algae, which are particularly well adapted to summertime conditions. All lagoons showed increasing proportion and occurrence of peridinin-rich dinophytes over time, probably related to their capacity for mixotrophy. The diversity patterns were marked by a strong variability in eutrophic and hypertrophic lagoons whereas phytoplankton community structure reached the highest diversity and stability in mesotrophic lagoons. We observe that during the re-oligotrophication process in coastal lagoons, phytoplankton shows complex trajectories with similarities with those observed in freshwater lake systems...|$|E

The basin (surface area: 0. 3 km²; maximum depth: 15 m) is an original example of a lotic-lentic system, located in Central Italy in a Reserve classified as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC, European Union Directive 92 / 43 /EEC). The lake originates from a complex of groundwater and surface karstic springs belonging to the Marsica hydrogeologic system and comprises a wide reed stand crossed by canals and the only floating island of the South Europe (diameter: abount 30 m). High flow and constant temperature (10 - 11 °C) characterize the lake water, which discharges in the Fibreno river at a flow of about 10 m³. sec- 1. Aquatic vegetation and invertebrates were collected bimonthly with an hand dredge in six stations during one year. Ten tipically lotic/lentic plant taxa were collected, which colonized mostly the 0 - 3 m depth range and were distributed according to water flow regimes. High numbers of zoological groups (28) were found, comprising 94 taxa, mostly represented by insects (34) and secondarily by nematodes, oligochaetes, gastropods and crustaceans, thank to the assemblage of invertebrates typical of lentic and lotic waters. The presence of indicator taxa and the measure of some bioindices performed on the invertebrate community have indicated an oligo-mesotrophic condition, with a trophic gradient varying from oligotrophy to <b>mesotrophy</b> according to different plant composition and lake hydrodynamics. Although some signs of eutrophication were revelead by high phosphate contents in the water, high concentration of organic matter in the sediments, disappearance of vegetation with respect to the past years, extensive growth of the sulfumbacterium Thiopedia rosea on the bottom, the plant-associated invertebrate community still showed a good ecological status following the positive effect of dilution-removal of nutrients caused by the continuous water flow of the lake...|$|E

This study represents the first attempt to develop diatom-based palaeolimnological inference models {{for the assessment of}} eutrophication in UK lowland reservoirs. Models are developed from a 46 -reservoir calibration set comprising surface sediment diatom assemblages and contemporary environmental data measured seasonally between May 1999 and October 2000. Following removal of outliers the dataset spans a total phosphorus (TP) gradient of 12 - 242 µgl ˉ¹ (mean = 63), a chlorophyll-α (Chla) gradient of 1. 8 - 25. 5 µgl ˉ¹ (mean = 63) and a conductivity (EC) gradient of 119 - 781 µScm ˉ¹ (mean = 424). Reservoir mean annual epilimnetic TP, Chla and EC are reconstructed using weighted averaging (WA) and weighted average partial least squares (WAPLS) techniques. Jack-knifed error statistics for the best performing models (WA inverse deshrinking), are comparable to those reported from similar studies. The plankton provides the dominant habitat for diatom growth in reservoirs, thus plankton-only models are also created and perform almost as well as models developed using all taxa. Examination of seasonal diatom plankton populations indicates that many taxa display defined seasonal growth preferences. The transition of frustules from live to sedimentary assemblages reveals that reservoir productivity and hence sedimentation rates affect subsequent representation of seasonal diatom populations in surface sediment samples. Fossil diatom assemblages in sediment cores from two contrasting reservoirs are analysed and the UK lowland reservoirs TP, EC and Chla inference models applied to reconstruct reservoir nutrient histories, yielding a fuller account of ecological change than either model alone. Twentieth-century reconstructions from Blackbrook reservoir illustrate an early history of limited impact <b>mesotrophy,</b> followed by a shift to cultural eutrophication during recent decades. Daventry reservoir shows a history of nutrient enrichment to hypertrophy, followed by subsequent re-oligotrophication as a result of pollution-reduction measures. Available historical data support the broad trends inferred by the diatom-based inference models.

40|$|Lake Fibreno (surface area: 0. 28 km²; mean depth: 2. 7 m) is a “spring lake” {{located in}} Central Italy in a Natural Reserve and {{originates}} from submerged and surface waters of a karstic hydrogeological system (Marsica Mountains, Abruzzo National Park). The surface water enters {{at a high}} flow and at a constant temperature of 10 - 11 °C, and discharges in the only effluent (Fibreno river) at a flow of about 10 m³. sec- 1 (annual mean of the last forty years). The lake enlarges in a plain and wide common reed bed and comprises the southernmost floating island of Europe. For its characteristics Lake Fibreno represents an original example of lotic-lentic system, so physico-chemical parameters and zoobenthos associated with aquatic plants were studied with the aim to evaluate the benthic composition and to define the lake ecological status in view of its conservation. The samples (water, vegetation and invertebrate fauna) were collected bymonthly in six stations during one year (2004). From the hydrochemical point of view the freshwater system is comprised {{in the field of}} calcic-bicarbonate waters (pH: 7. 1; Ca 2 +: 143 mg/l; HCO 3 -: 411 mg/l, annual means). High contents of phosphate compounds (range: 82 - 148 µg/l) were found. As to the vegetation, remarkable is the presence of aquatic macrophyte species that characterize several Natura 2000 's habitats. The river macrophyte communities are generally dominated by Sparganium and Potamogeton oligo-mesotrophic species. Close to the spring area prevail Apium nodiflorum, Berula erecta and Hippuris vulgaris, and whereas standing water occurs, macrophyte communities change again in composition, with dominance of Callitriche and Lemna species. Thirty four groups of invertebrates were found, mostly represented by insects and crustaceans, which reached altogheter 85 % of the total fauna. Microcrustaceans (range: 8 - 62 %) quantitatively prevailed, followed by chironomids (6 - 36 %), oligochaetes (2 - 14 %) and water mites (0. 4 - 18 %). The percentage invertebrate composition was remarkably different at the sites of sampling, according firstly to water flow regimes (lentic or lotic prevailing character) and composition and abundance of plant substrate. Faunal densities have revealed increasing <b>mesotrophy</b> from spring to river sites. Numbers of invertebrates, moderate coverages of submerged plants, high values of phosphates and organically enriched sediments clearly indicated a negative trend to an eutrophic state of the lake, which certainly need a recovery project...|$|E
40|$|The {{variability}} in microbial communities (abundance and biomass), bacterial production and ectoaminopeptidase activity, particulate and {{dissolved organic carbon}} (POC, DOC), and particulate and dissolved lipids was examined in spring 1995 in the northwestern Mediterranean, where a transition {{from the end of}} a bloom to pre-oligotrophic conditions was observed. Four time series of 36 h each and 4 h sampling intervals were performed at 5 m and at the chlorophyll maximum (30 m) between 11 and 31 May. Simultaneous measurements of pigments, abundance of hetero- and autotrophic flagellates, bacteria and POC enabled the estimation of living POC (defined as autotrophic-C plus heterotrophic-C biomass), and thus the detrital organic carbon. During the first 2 time series (11 to 15 May), the bacterial-C biomass was higher than the autotrophic-C biomass at 5 m (ratio 1. 4 and 1. 7), whereas the opposite trend was observed in the chlorophyll peak (ratio 0. 7 for the first cycle). However, at the end of May, autotrophic-C biomass was equivalent to bacterial-C biomass at both depths studied. The detrital pool remained a more or less constant fraction of the POC (52, 53 and 47 % on 11 - 12 May, 14 - 15 May and 30 - 31 May) at the chlorophyll peak, whereas it decreased significantly with time (62 to 53 %) at 5 m. Relationships between bacterial activities and evolution of available resources were not systematically evidenced from our 36 h diel cycle data. Nevertheless, at the monthly scale, comparison of bacterial carbon demand (BCD) to potential carbon resources (detrital POC and DOC) showed that bacteria fed differently on the various pools. From ectoaminopeptidase turnover rates and detrital POC, the potential hydrolysis rate of detritus was calculated. Depending on the choice of conversion factors for bacterial production and estimates of hydrolysis turnover rates, it was shown that bacterial hydrolysis of detritus {{could be one of the}} DOC accumulation sources. We observed that the percentage of BCD supplied by detrital POC hydrolysis increased in the surface and decreased in the chlorophyll peak. An index of lipid degradation in POC, the lipolysis index, increased during the month at 5 m, also indicating a higher hydrolysis of POC. The opposite trend was observed in the chlorophyll maximum layer. The selective decrease in dissolved lipids in DOC in the chlorophyll maximum layer, particularly free fatty acids, also suggests that bacteria utilized increased fractions of carbon sources from the DOC. We concluded that partitioning between DOC and detritus as resources for bacteria can change during the rapid transition period from <b>mesotrophy</b> to oligotrophy in the northwestern Mediterranean...|$|E
40|$|Lake Ontario is the 13 th largest lake in {{the world}} with a surface area of 18, 500 km² (Reynolds et al. 2000), has a {{population}} in the watershed of over 8 million, and provides a range of ecosystem services {{to the people in the}} watershed (freshwater for various uses, shipping, fisheries, and recreation). Currently, extensive surveys for each Great Lake occur on a rotating five-year schedule. This report presents the status of Lake Ontario’s lower trophic levels in 2008 and a detailed comparison with similarly collected in 2003 and with data collected by the collaborating agencies and Cornell University and discuss observed changes in relation to changes in nutrient concentration and food web configuration in Lake Ontario. There has been a spatial restructuring of the Lake Ontario offshore ecosystem through the increase in the deep chlorophyll layer and associated zooplankton. This has resulted in a Lake Ontario that in 2008 is more similar to Lakes Superior, Huron and Michigan than to the Lake Ontario of the 1990 s. Major findings are Nutrients: Spring offshore total phosphorus and soluble reactive phosphorus increased from 2003 to 2008, but summer levels did not. Lake-wide average total phosphorus levels remained at or below the target level of 10 µg/L in all three seasons of 2008. Lake-wide nutrient concentrations have declined since the 1960 s. However, phosphorus concentrations have been stable (~ 7 - 10 µg/L) since the mid- 1990 s. Spring silica was similar in 2003 and 2008 and was depleted by the summer in both years. This indicates continued spring diatom production in Lake Ontario. Phytoplankton: Summer epilimnetic chlorophyll-a increased by a factor of 2, the proportion of autotrophic algae increased, and summer water clarity declined from 2003 to 2008. Summer chlorophyll-a levels in 2008 were similar to the concentrations in the 1981 - 1995 time period. However, the trend towards <b>mesotrophy</b> in the summer of 2008 may be limited to that year as it was not followed by increased values in 2009 to 2011. Most of the chlorophyll in the water column was located in a deep chlorophyll layer in the thermocline. Zooplankton: Offshore epilimnetic zooplankton density and biomass declined from 2003 to 2008 by a factor of 5 to 12 in the summer and by a factor of 1. 5 to 2. 6 in the fall. This is consistent with long-term trends of declining epilimnetic zooplankton abundance including a larger decline in 2004 - 2005 coincident with an increase in the predatory Bythotrephes. Whole water column zooplankton density also declined from 2003 to 2008 in the summer and fall, but zooplankton biomass only declined in the fall. Large changes in whole water column zooplankton community composition occurred between 2003 and 2008 from a cyclopoid/bosminid dominated system in 2003 to a calanoid dominated system in 2008. Mysids, Diporeia and Mussels Mysid densities were similar in 2003 and 2008 indicating continued high biomass of mysids in Lake Ontario. In July of 2008, the biomass of Mysis diluviana was 17 % of the crustacean zooplankton biomass in the offshore of Lake Ontario (depth > 30 m). Mysid densities appear stable in Lake Ontario. The native benthic amphipod Diporeia declined further in 2008 and is almost extirpated from Lake Ontario. Quagga mussels are very abundant as deep as 90 m, but populations in shallow water declined from 2003 to 2008. Few zebra mussels were present in either 2003 or 2008.

40|$|Recent anecdotal {{evidence}} {{has suggested that}} Lake Diefenbaker, a large reservoir in southern Saskatchewan, Canada, has been experiencing an increased frequency and severity of algal blooms, suggesting significant alterations in water quality. Due to limited historical water quality monitoring, a paleolimnological investigation of Lake Diefenbaker sediments was conducted in order to interpret spatial and temporal trends in the physicochemistry of sediment cores collected from mid-channel locations along a spatial gradient. Total phosphorus and three sediment species of phosphorus (apatite inorganic phosphorus, non-apatite inorganic phosphorus (NAIP) and organic phosphorus (OP) were measured along the vertical profile of the cores to interpret nutrient loading trends. Trends in historical primary productivity were inferred based on total organic carbon, total nitrogen, δ 15 N values and the organic carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratios. In addition, sub-fossil biological remains of diatoms and chironomid larvae were isolated from selected subsections of the sediment cores and identified to assess shifts in community compositions and to infer historical changes in reservoir water quality conditions. Up-reservoir sampling locations showed consistent concentrations of total phosphorus and the three species of phosphorus, organic carbon, nitrogen, δ 15 N values and C:N ratios in the vertical profile of collected sediment cores. This suggested relatively consistent nutrient loading and primary production in the up-reservoir regions for the period represented by the core profiles. Down-reservoir sediment cores showed an increasing trend in total phosphorus concentration, mainly in the more biologically available NAIP and OP fractions, and enrichment in organic carbon, nitrogen and 15 N in more recently deposited sediments. This combined with a decreasing C:N ratio in more recent sediments suggests increased nutrient loading to the sediments and increasing primary productivity at down-reservoir sites. Strong correlations between sediment total organic carbon content and the more biologically available sediment phosphorus fractions (NAIP and OP) suggest that phosphorus deposition patterns are strongly influenced by primary productivity within the reservoir. The compositions of diatom and chironomid communities were consistent over time at up-reservoir locations, with Stephanodiscus parvus dominating the diatom communities and Procladius sp. dominating the chironomid communities. This suggests relatively stable and consistent trophic status and primary productivity in this region. Conversely, major shifts occurred in the diatom and benthic chironomid communities at down-reservoir locations. These shifts were consistent with typical reservoir ontogeny. A shift in dominance from Stephanodiscus parvus to Asterionella formosa, Tabellaria flocculosa and Stephanodiscus medius followed by a shift to Aulacosiera ambigua suggests an initial period of eutrophy, followed by a period of <b>mesotrophy,</b> and finally a transition into a more productive system in recent years. The increase in relative abundance of the chironomid tribe Tanytarsini suggests rising levels of organic matter sedimentation, likely due to increased autochthonous primary productivity. Low chironomid head capsule counts were observed at all locations within Lake Diefenbaker. Despite the low head capsule counts, a 10 -day whole-sediment toxicity test using Chironomus dilutus, revealed that Lake Diefenbaker sediments, in proximity to two potential point sources of contamination (aquaculture and municipal discharge), {{as well as two}} reference locations, were not of toxicological concern. Despite the lack of toxicity associated with Lake Diefenbaker sediments, it was concluded that Lake Diefenbaker sediments are likely poor habitat for chironomids. This study suggests that primary productivity and nutrient status has remained relatively constant at up-reservoir locations for the period represented by the collected cores. This is likely due to up-reservoir locations being more riverine than down-reservoir regions, which results in increased turbidity causing phytoplankton populations to be light limited. Primary productivity appears to increase spatially with increased distance down reservoir, likely due to a gradual transition to more lacustrine environments, resulting in less turbidity and less light limitation. Temporally, down-reservoir locations appear to be showing increases in primary productivity and nutrient entrainment in sediments. This is likely a result of increased nutrient availability over time and entrainment of these nutrients in sediments at down-reservoir locations by primary producers...|$|E
