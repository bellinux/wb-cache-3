2500|$|Debuting {{with sales}} of 12,500 (around the [...] "break even" [...] mark for a color comic, {{although}} [...] "like ten thousand more" [...] than Bendis' previous book, Torso), Powers was faced with an uncertain future, as sales of comics tend to dwindle over subsequent issues. However, Image Comics publisher Jim Valentino and head of marketing Anthony Bozzi both read and enjoyed the first three issues (lettered and laid out by Bendis himself, a hang-over from his earlier fully creator-owned works where he took on the complete roles of several individuals), with Bozzi reportedly saying, [...] "If we can't <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> like POWERS sell we really should stop making comics." [...] Image offered to double-ship the second issue, effectively doubling the orders for that issue {{as an attempt to}} boost sales: the gamble worked, and issue #1 was soon reprinted, while according to Bendis, [...] "issues #3–11 saw an upswing" [...] in sales every issue. The reported Diamond pre-order figures show sales climbing above 23,000 by issue #7, and topping 30,000 with issue #14 and stabilizing between 25,000 and 30,000 {{for the remainder of the}} titles' Image run. [...] These strong sales allowed Oeming to quit his job as a security guard, while Bendis' launch of Ultimate Spider-Man had a positive effect on Powers sales as readers searched out his comics.|$|E
