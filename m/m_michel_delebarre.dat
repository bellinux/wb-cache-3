50|$|In 1988 French Transport Minister <b>Michel</b> <b>Delebarre</b> {{partially}} {{reversed the}} French government's relaxed policy on allocating traffic {{rights to the}} country's three main contemporary scheduled airlines {{when he decided to}} deny UTA the right to fly non-stop from Paris to Newark in direct competition with Air France. The aim was to protect Air France's position as the country's dominant scheduled carrier by making UTA a less attractive takeover target for its foreign rivals {{in the event of a}} merger. The French government feared that Air France's smaller size relative to British Airways, Lufthansa and the US giants as well as its fragmented long-haul network put it at a commercial disadvantage in a liberalised air transport market. Air France, Air Inter and UTA were therefore encouraged to co-operate rather than compete with each other.|$|R
