5|$|Based on Japanese mythology, Orochimaru {{was created}} {{as one of}} the series' main antagonists, and {{intended}} to represent the opposite of the protagonists' morals and values. His snake-like appearance and related features were intended to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> the reader to recognize that he is a villain. In Japanese, Orochimaru has been voiced by Kujira whereas in the English dub he is voiced by Steve Blum.|$|E
5|$|Hippopotamus lemerlei bones {{have been}} mostly {{discovered}} in the rivers and lakes of western Madagascar, suggesting a riparian lifestyle, {{very similar to that}} of the modern hippopotamus of modern Africa. H. lemerlei also shared the high-orbits that <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> the hippopotamus to see while in the water. The skull of H. lemerlei also resembled that of the modern hippopotamus, but with consistent size differences, indicating that H. lemerlei was a sexually dimorphic species.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural {{improvement}} and the Industrial Revolution came to Aberdaron in the 19th century. The Inclosure (Consolidation) Act 1801 {{was intended to}} <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> landlords to enclose and improve common land, introduce increased efficiency, bring more land under the plough, and reduce the high prices of agricultural production. Rhoshirwaun Common, following strong opposition, was enclosed in 1814; while the process was not completed in Aberdaron, Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw until 1861. On the industrial front, mining developed as {{a major source of}} employment, especially at Y Rhiw, where manganese was discovered in 1827.|$|E

5|$|Proactiv {{is aimed}} at {{customers}} with mild to moderate acne. According to a 2011 review, {{there have been few}} studies examining its efficacy. A 2007 study saw inflammatory lesions reduced by 39 percent in subjects using a combination of butenafine and benzoyl peroxide, compared with 34 percent in those using Proactiv containing only benzoyl peroxide. A physician suggested in Salon that its three-step system might <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> teenagers to comply, but that the key to its success lay with its celebrity endorsements.|$|E
5|$|Several press {{accounts}} {{reported that}} Timoshenko {{was shot by}} an unlicensed gun that came from Virginia. Previous reports indicated that the gun dealer had previously been indicted for his illegal gun sales, and that all the weapons found in the BMW were illegally obtained. The gun shop in question is now closed, and the dealer has been stripped of his license. Because the gun was used by {{a person with a}} criminal history, and because the NYPD was denied requests to look up the seller of the gun, legislators sought to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> law enforcement to carry out their investigative duties.|$|E
5|$|Stelmach {{clashed with}} rural landowners again in 2009 when his {{government}} introduced the Land Assembly Project Area Act, designed to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> {{the government to}} acquire large blocks of land for public purposes such as ring roads or reservoirs. The Act allowed the government to identify land {{that it may be}} interested in expropriating {{at some point in the}} future and to indefinitely prohibit any development on that land that could conflict with the government's purposes. Despite vigorous opposition from landowners and the opposition parties, the bill passed the legislature in late April.|$|E

5|$|The {{solubility}} of cerium is {{much higher}} in methanesulfonic acid. Cerium(III) and terbium(III) have ultraviolet absorption bands of relatively high intensity compared with the other lanthanides, as their configurations (one electron more than an empty or half-filled f-subshell respectively) <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> the extra f electron to undergo f→d transitions instead of the forbidden f→f transitions of the other lanthanides. Cerium(III) sulfate {{is one of the}} few salts whose solubility in water decreases with rising temperature.|$|E
5|$|Writing for GameSpot, {{reviewer}} Joe Fielder {{highlighted the}} graphics {{for their new}} lighting effects and varied textures, saying that they improve the gameplay experience because they <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> players to identify ledges and jump-off points. Douglass Perry of IGN remarked that the upgraded engine made the game look better than its predecessors, but overall considered Tomb Raider III to be outdated, especially when compared to newer engines that were released at the time. Edge felt that the old controls did not suit the more complex environments and criticised the game's lack of narrative and cinematic presentation.|$|E
5|$|Chapman also {{advocated}} {{the use of}} white footballs and numbered shirts, as well as adding hoops to Arsenal's socks to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> players to pick each other out. He later made a further change to Arsenal's kit, adding white sleeves to the previously all-red shirt and brightening the colour, before a match against Liverpool on 4 March 1933; the same kit theme of red with white sleeves or trim survives to this day. The tradition of both teams walking out together at the FA Cup Final was started in 1930 due to Herbert Chapman's involvement with both clubs, and has continued since.|$|E

5|$|Knowing {{that his}} {{reputation}} {{was at stake}} following the much publicised Tora! Tora! Tora! debacle, Kurosawa moved quickly to a new project to prove he was still viable. To his aid came friends and famed directors Keisuke Kinoshita, Masaki Kobayashi and Kon Ichikawa, who together with Kurosawa established in July 1969 a production company called the Club of the Four Knights (Yonki no kai). Although the plan was for the four directors to create a film each, {{it has been suggested}} that the real motivation for the other three directors was to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> Kurosawa to successfully complete a film, and therefore find his way back into the business.|$|E
5|$|About {{half the}} {{potential}} prey that hit orb webs escape. A web has to perform three functions: intercepting the prey (intersection), absorbing its momentum without breaking (stopping), and trapping the prey by entangling it or sticking to it (retention). No single design {{is best for}} all prey. For example: wider spacing of lines will increase the web's area and hence its ability to intercept prey, but reduce its stopping power and retention; closer spacing, larger sticky droplets and thicker lines would improve retention, but would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> potential prey to see and avoid the web, at least during the day. However, there are no consistent differences between orb webs built for use {{during the day and}} those built for use at night. In fact, there is no simple relationship between orb web design features and the prey they capture, as each orb-weaving species takes a wide range of prey.|$|E
5|$|Although {{beyond their}} jurisdiction, the Navigation commissioners {{attempted}} {{to extend their}} powers, to improve the river below the junction with Aike Beck. They particularly wanted to replace the stone Hull Bridge, near Beverley, with a swing bridge, which would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> keels to reach Frodingham bridge. The Corporation of Beverley objected, because the bridge was the main route of communication between Beverley and Holderness, and the commissioners instead dredged parts of the river to improve access. Plans to improve Hull Bridge were again resisted by Beverley Corporation in 1799, but an agreement was finally reached in 1801, and an Act of Parliament was obtained in July of that year. William Chapman acted as engineer, as the act authorised the construction of towpaths, a new cut between Bethels Bridge and the lock at Struncheon Hill, to avoid a long loop in the river, and rebuilding of the bridge. The bridge cost £500, half of which was met by Richard Bethell, {{the owner of the}} Leven Canal, on condition that the tolls for passing through it were reduced significantly.|$|E

5|$|During the game's development, Harmonix {{only used}} low-fidelity {{versions}} of the remasters, which were sufficient for programming and note charting; Apple Corps feared that the leak of any high-fidelity remastered track from Abbey Road studios {{would lead to the}} unauthorized use of samples of the Beatles' music in remixes. High-fidelity {{versions of the}} songs were not implemented until the final publishing of the game. Harmonix performed very little additional remixing upon receipt of these remasters; in some cases, three different guitar parts—lead, solo, and rhythm—were brought into a single cohesive guitar part, slightly raising the volume of the specific guitar track that was used in note tracking to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> the player to follow in the game. The ability for up to three players to sing vocal harmonies, a feature not present in previous Rock Band games, was designed and implemented as an optional feature {{so as not to be}} overwhelming to players.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{remained}} in captivity during the negotiations in Versailles that ultimately produced the treaty {{that ended the}} war. A copy of The Times informed von Reuter that the Armistice was to expire at noon on 21 June 1919, the deadline by which Germany was to have signed the peace treaty. Rear Admiral von Reuter {{came to the conclusion}} that the British intended to seize the German ships after the Armistice expired. To prevent this, he decided to scuttle his ships at the first opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers; at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Hindenburg was the last ship to sink, at 17:00. Her captain had deliberately arranged that the ship sank on an even keel to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> her crew to escape. After several unsuccessful attempts, she was raised on 23 July 1930, only to be scrapped at Rosyth between 1930 and 1932. Her bell was presented to the Bundesmarine (Federal Navy) on 28 May 1959.|$|E
5|$|The second {{generation}} Mac Pro has a redesigned configuration of ports. It has a HDMI 1.4 port, dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, six Thunderbolt 2 ports, four USB 3 ports, and combined digital Mini-TOSlink optical / analog 3.5mm stereo mini jack for audio output. It {{also has a}} headphones mini jack (the two are distinctly selectable within the Sound System Preference panel, Output tab). There is no dedicated port for inputting audio. The system has a low-fidelity internal mono speaker. The Thunderbolt 2 ports support up to thirty-six Thunderbolt devices (six per port) and can concurrently support up to three 4K displays. This design requires two GPUs to support the seven display outputs (HDMI and six Thunderbolt). The I/O panel illuminates itself when the unit senses it has been moved to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> the user to see the ports. Unlike the previous model, it has no FireWire 800 ports, dedicated digital audio in/out ports, a SuperDrive, DVI port, 3.5-inch drive bays for replaceable storage drives, or changeable internal PCIe slots. Instead, there are six Thunderbolt 2 ports to connect high-speed external peripherals, including enclosures for internal PCIe cards.|$|E

5|$|Various {{other plans}} were {{considered}} to address the debt issues during the first session of Congress, but none were able to generate widespread support. In September 1789, with no resolution in sight and the close of that session drawing near, Congress directed Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton to prepare a report on credit. In his Report on the Public Credit (the first of three fiscal and economic policy reports), Hamilton called for the federal assumption of state debt and the mass issuance of federal bonds. Hamilton believed that these measures would restore the ailing economy, ensure a stable and adequate money stock, and <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> {{the federal government to}} borrow during emergencies such as wars. He also proposed redeeming the promissory notes issued by the Continental Congress during the American Revolution at full value. Many former soldiers had sold their notes at a fraction of face value, believing them to be worthless. He planned to buy back the promissory notes from their current holders. This idea drew loud objections from many who were of the opinion that the notes should be paid back either to the original holder or to both the current and original holder.|$|E
