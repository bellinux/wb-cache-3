40|$|ABSTRACT: One of {{the most}} serious {{environmental}} issues related to the mining industry in Canada and elsewhere, is the pollution from abandoned <b>mine</b> waste <b>disposal</b> sites. The wastes containing sulphide minerals can oxidize and generate contaminants in the water drainage, a phenomenon called acid mine drainage (AMD). Different techniques are available to control the production of AMD. However, these techniques were mainly developed for the closure of operating sites, and are not as efficient for abandoned mine sites that were left exposed to natural conditions for years. The main differences between an operating and abandoned <b>mine</b> waste <b>disposal</b> site are the quality of the interstitial water, the presence of well implemented acidophilic bacteria, {{and the quality of the}} retaining infrastructures. To avoid contamination of surrounding ecosystems, it is necessary to take into consideration these particularities at the reclamation stage. The experience at the Lorraine mine site shows a slight improvement of the water quality in the waste disposal site 10 years after reclamation even if the oxygen barrier is working as expected. The addition of a passive treatment system to treat the contaminated pore water that will eventually flow out of the site is then a critical component of the reclamation at any abandoned AMD <b>mine</b> waste <b>disposal</b> site...|$|R

There {{has been}} limited {{experience}} {{in the use of}} hydrometallurgy to process nickel sulfide concentrate, thus the hydrometallurgical process residue is generally not well characterized in the open literature. This research will assist in ensuring the long-term stability of the waste and increase the understanding of its degradation and reactivity on disposal. The research pertains to the mobility of metals and sulfur compounds, their stability in minerals and phases associated with hydrometallurgical residues {{and the development of a}} risk-based methodology for selection of <b>mine</b> waste <b>disposal</b> designs. The research focuses on sulfur compounds and ore metals, such as nickel, cobalt and copper, which are target metals for the proposed hydrometallurgical processing facility in Long Harbour, Newfoundland. It will be particularly important to understand the effect of high sulfur waste material in Newfoundland's wet, temperate climate and generally slightly acidic surface water conditions. The research objectives are to characterize the mobility of metals from hydrometallurgical residue and assess residue reactivity/stability under different disposal conditions in order to determine the most favourable waste disposal procedures. Specific research objectives include: 1) characterization of the waste residues through mineralogical studies and elemental analysis; 2) assessment of acid and metal generating potential of the waste through static and kinetic tests and geochemical modeling; 3) assessment of decant water conditions in the residue impoundment through a calibrated numerical model; 4) evaluation of residue subsurface disposal conditions on a spatial and temporal basis through numerical modeling calibrated by in-situ field testing; and 5) prediction of the fate of heavy metals in the receiving environments. Finally, a risk-based, multi-criteria decision making approach is developed to assess various <b>mine</b> waste <b>disposal</b> options and applied through a case study. [...] As there is very limited experience in the processing of nickel sulfide concentrate through hydrometallurgy the high sulfur, process residue is generally not well characterized. The mineralogical and sequential extraction work provided key residue mineral and microstructure information; suggested how target metals are present in the residue minerals and phases; and provided metal partitioning results which are important in understanding the residues metal leaching potential. The static and kinetic testing conducted further characterized the residues by assessing their acid generating and metal leaching capacity. Geochemical modeling of process residues is not widely reported in the literature due in part to the complexity of the mineralogical assemblage.

The filter cloths were tested with three coal waste samples in stand-pipes used to simulate coal <b>mine</b> waste <b>disposal</b> environments.

In other tests, exposures to waters in the pH range of 2 to 12 and to reagents used in coal-preparation plants resulted in insignificant or no deterioration, as measured by tensile strength.

40|$|Abstract: The {{generation}} of electricity by thermal conversion of coal results in significant volumes of solid waste. Most of these materials are disposed of in surface impoundments near coal-fired power plants or in active coal <b>mines.</b> <b>Disposal</b> rates vary from country to country. In the USA, 60 - 70 wt % of these materials are disposed. Although these materials rarely meet he definition of hazardous, leachate tests on some coal ash have shown them capable of producing elevated concentrations of some regulated metals. As {{a result of the}} well-documented nvironmental concerns posed by coal combustion, and the disposal of coal combustion products (CCPs), a large body of research as focused on characterizing the mechanisms of mobilization and attenuation of trace elements in coal and its ash. However, groups opposed to coal combustion or unregulated disposal f sh overlook the value of these materials as well-proven replacements for aggregate, cement, or soil in numerous engineering and agricultural pplications. An extensive body of knowledge has been gathered escribing the variability and versatility of these materials. It has been shown that proper utilization or management of ash requires a good understanding of its chemical, physical, and mineralogical properties. This chapter is intended to provide...|$|R

During recent decades, increased emphasis {{has been placed on}} effluent control and treatment, {{in order to avoid the}} threat to the environment posed by toxic constituents. In many modern gold mining and ore processing operations, cyanide species are of most immediate concern. Given that natural degradation processes are known to reduce the toxicity of cyanide over time, trials have been made at laboratory and field scales into the feasibility of using wetland-based passive systems as low-cost and environmentally friendly methods for long-term treatment of leachates from closed gold <b>mine</b> tailing <b>disposal</b> facilities. Laboratory experiments on discrete aerobic and anaerobic treatment units supported the development of design parameters for the construction of a field-scale passive system at a gold mine site in northern Spain. An in situ pilot-scale wetland treatment system was designed, constructed and monitored over a nine-month period. Overall, the results suggest that compost-based constructed wetlands are capable of detoxifying cyanidation effluents, removing about 21. 6 % of dissolved cyanide and 98 % of Cu, as well as nitrite and nitrate. Wetland-based passive systems can therefore be considered as a viable technology for removal of residual concentrations of cyanide from leachates emanating from closed gold <b>mine</b> tailing <b>disposal</b> facilities...|$|R
