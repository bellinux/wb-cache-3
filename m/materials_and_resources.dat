5|$|Evaluating Mountfort's works today, one has {{to avoid}} judging them against a {{background}} of similar designs in Europe. In the 1860s, New Zealand was a developing country, where <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>resources</b> freely available in Europe were conspicuous by their absence. When available they were often of inferior quality, as Mountfort discovered with the unseasoned wood in his first disastrous project. His first buildings in his new homeland were often too tall, or steeply pitched, failing to take account of the non-European climate and landscape. However, he soon adapted, and developed his skill in working with crude and unrefined materials.|$|E
25|$|Pearson later recounted {{that the}} meeting was acrimonious, but insisted the two parted cordially. After this incident, L.B.J. and Pearson did have further contacts, {{including}} two more meetings together, both times in Canada as the United States relied on Canada's raw <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>resources</b> to fuel and sustain its efforts in the Vietnam War.|$|E
25|$|Resource {{recovery}} is the systematic diversion of waste, which {{was intended for}} disposal, for a specific next use. It is the processing of recyclables to extract or recover <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>resources,</b> or convert to energy. These activities are performed at a resource recovery facility. Resource {{recovery is}} not only environmentally important, {{but it is also}} cost-effective. It decreases the amount of waste for disposal, saves space in landfills, and conserves natural resources.|$|E

25|$|Although {{there is}} no single {{definition}} for what constitutes a Green Building, some elements recur in describing the concept. A Green Building can thus be defined as a high-performance building designed, built, operated and disposed of in a resource-efficient manner with the aim to minimize the overall (negative) impact on the built environment, human health and the natural environment. Some examples of green building features are choice of site and orientation, efficient use of <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>resources,</b> indoor environmental quality and innovation.|$|E
25|$|Another {{building}} that has won an award is Robert H. Bruininks Hall, originally named Science Teaching and Student Services (STSS) at its opening in August 2010. This building {{has been awarded}} the prestigious LEED Gold certification. LEED, or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, is an internationally recognized green building certification system administered by the U.S. Green Building Council. LEED measures multiple dimensions of a building's design and construction including sustainable sites, energy and atmosphere, <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>resources,</b> water efficiency, and indoor environmental quality.|$|E
25|$|Manyikeni, a Zimbabwean {{traditional}} {{style of}} stone walled settlement 10km west of Chibuene, possibly {{gained control of}} the site after AD 1200. This is attested by the increased similarity of later occupation deposits containing pottery similar in character to Manyikeni. In addition, this is corroborated {{by the presence of}} marine shell and imports from Indian ocean trade in the context of Manyikeni deposits suggesting the coast and hinterlands were connected through trade networks. Chibuene acted as the way point for entry of <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>resources</b> from the eastern coast and the trade network it provided.|$|E

25|$|Later in 2007 the Canada Green Building Council {{upgraded}} it to LEED Gold, {{again the}} first time that recognition had been granted to a building in the North. The council credited the Greenstone Building with 42 of a possible 70 points. Of those, it was found to be the most successful in water efficiency, earning all of the five possible points in that area. It also did well in innovation and design, with four out of five, and indoor environmental quality, at 10 of 15. <b>Materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>resources</b> was its weakest area, with only four of 14 earned. It was the first LEED Gold building for the architects.|$|E

2500|$|Approximately 800 years ago, Māori {{arrived on}} these islands. During the pre-colonial period mana whenua (territorial rights) over the Calton Hill area were held by three {{indigenous}} iwi (tribes), {{though there is}} no known archaeological evidence that shows direct residential occupation of Calton Hill itself. [...] By the 19th century, two of these three iwi (Kāti Mamoe and Waitaha) had largely been subsumed by the largest, Kāi Tahu. The Calton Hill/Caversham Valley area was likely used as a thoroughfare south alongside coastal transportation provided by waka hourua (double hulled sailing canoes). Various areas may have been sites for nohoanga (temporary food gathering camps), gathering potable water, mahinga kai (food gathering area) for aruhe (bracken root) and ti kouka (Cabbage Tree), and for collecting other useful <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>resources.</b>|$|E
