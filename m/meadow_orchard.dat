50|$|On {{the way out}} of {{the village}} towards Wendelsheim, started in 1991, is a <b>meadow</b> <b>orchard</b> or streuobstwiese. Its area is about 1 ha, and there are all kinds of native fruit trees planted there that once grew all around the village of Nieder-Wiesen in great numbers. Seeing to the {{ecological}} management is the Evangelical church (there is a yearly “apple juice project”). An informational notice explaining the various fruit trees can be found at the orchard’s lower edge, and at the upper end is an “insect hotel”, installed in 2008.|$|E
50|$|Streuobstwiese (pl. Streuobstwiesen) is a German {{word that}} means a meadow with {{scattered}} fruit trees or fruit trees that are planted in a field. Streuobstwiese, or a <b>meadow</b> <b>orchard,</b> is a traditional landscape in the temperate, maritime climate of continental Western Europe. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Streuobstwiesen were {{a kind of a}} rural community orchard that were intended for productive cultivation of stone fruit. In recent years, ecologists have successfully lobbied for state subsidies to valuable habitats, biodiversity and natural landscapes, which are also used to preserve old meadow orchards. Both conventional and meadow orchards provide a suitable habitat for many animal species that live in a cultured landscape. A notable example is the hoopoe that nests in tree hollows of old fruit trees and, in the absence of alternative nesting sites, is threatened in many parts of Europe because of the destruction of old orchards.|$|E

40|$|Scattered trees support {{high levels}} of {{farmland}} biodiversity and ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes, but they are threatened by agricultural intensification, urbanization, and land abandonment. This study aimed to map and quantify the decline of <b>orchard</b> <b>meadows</b> (scattered fruit trees of high nature conservation value) for a region in Southwestern Germany for the 1968 2009 period and to identify the driving forces of this decline. We derived <b>orchard</b> <b>meadow</b> loss from 1968 and 2009 aerial images and used a boosted regression trees modelling framework to assess {{the relative importance of}} 18 environmental, demographic, and socio-economic variables to test five alternative hypothesis explaining <b>orchard</b> <b>meadow</b> loss. We found that <b>orchard</b> <b>meadow</b> loss occurred in flatter areas, in areas where smaller plot sizes and fragmented <b>orchard</b> <b>meadows</b> prevailed, and in areas near settlements and infrastructure. The analysis did not confirm that <b>orchard</b> <b>meadow</b> loss was higher in areas where agricultural intensification was stronger and in areas of lower implementation levels of conservation policies. Our results demonstrated that the influential drivers of <b>orchard</b> <b>meadow</b> loss were those that reduce economic profitability and increase opportunity costs for orchards, providing incentives for converting <b>orchard</b> <b>meadows</b> to other, more profitable land uses. These insights could be taken up by local- and regionallevel conservation policies to identify the sites of persistent <b>orchard</b> <b>meadows</b> in agricultural landscapes that would be prioritized in conservation efforts...|$|R

Planting tall-trunked fruit trees is financially promoted by the town.|$|R
50|$|Nineteenth-century {{agriculture}} in Jettenbach {{was characterized by}} many small farms. The farmers with bigger farms had horses, and sometimes oxen as draught animals. On smaller farms, the cow {{was used as a}} draught animal. From this need arose the almost exclusive use of the Glan-Donnersberg breed of cattle. It dominated in Jettenbach even into the 1960s. Most farms did cropraising and livestock husbandry. Pig farming was rather rare, and sheep were only raised until about the turn of the 19th century. Specialized crops are no longer raised in Jettenbach, although the village {{is said to have been}} a main growing centre for rapeseed in the Landcommissariat of Kusel in the years after 1820 (4 226 hl in 1826). About 1870, herb growing, particularly for the seed, was important in the village. Among the herbs then grown were hops, for the brewery that was then found in Jettenbach. Winegrowing may have been practised here in the Middle Ages, bearing witness to which are certain local cadastral toponyms. Between 1870 and 1900 there was once again a vineyard (1 000 m²) in the village. There was also fruitgrowing in a <b>meadow</b> <b>orchard.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Naturpark Soonwald-Nahe reaches {{from the}} heights of the Hunsrück over the {{quartzite}} combs of the Soonwald with its dales deeply carved by brooks to the vineyard slopes in the sunny and dry valley of the Nahe. The landscape and climate combine to give the park a great floral and faunal diversity. Found in the Soonwald-Nahe Nature Park are such varying habitats as blossom-filled woodland glades, mires, slate mine galleries, juniper heaths, <b>meadow</b> <b>orchard</b> areas, and brooks, riverside flats, dry grasslands and fallow vineyards with luxuriant orchid growth. The Salzkopf is the greatest elevation in the Bingen Forest (628 m). As early as 1899 the first wooden tower, mainly for military purposes, was built there by the Mainzer Pionierbataillon. In 1973, this tower was succeeded by a 24 m-tall one, the Salzkopfturm, {{which had to be}} renovated in 1997 owing to damage from carpenter ants. It is constructed of waterproofed sprucewood, while the steps are made of oak from the forest itself. It stands just north of Daxweiler. On a clear day, one can enjoy an outstanding view of up to 140 km. Living in the nature park is a broad palette of native animals. Among mammals are the red deer and the wild boar, Mustelidae, fox, badgers and bats as well as the otherwise now rare wildcat. which is widespread in the Hunsrück. The park furthermore harbours many rare bird species, among them 29 on the IUCN Red List. Among reptiles are the grass snake, the smooth snake, the common lizard, the common wall lizard and the sand lizard as well as the blindworm. Amphibians are represented foremost in the dales. Species found in the park include the fire salamander, the alpine newt, the northern crested newt, the palmate newt, the smooth newt, the common midwife toad, the yellow-bellied toad, the common toad and the natterjack toad as well as green frogs and the common frog.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} cover characterizing local land use {{takes the form}} of <b>meadow</b> <b>orchards,</b> <b>meadows</b> and cropﬁelds along with some 60 ha of mixed forest. The south slope at the so-called Wingertsberg (“Vineyard’s Mountain”) was still characterized in the 19th century by vineyards and hillside meadows. The last vineyard was dissolved in 1945. Currently, many vineyard walls are still well preserved. The municipal area was divided wholly into agricultural smallholds; there was not even one major block of land in only one owner’s hands. Often, as a result of inheritance disputes, plots were split into ever smaller pieces. The municipal area measures 401 ha.|$|R

40|$|From a {{historical}} point of view, {{it is obvious}} that agriculture is responsible for building the cultural landscapes of Europe. In a process of hundreds of years, the natural landscapes had been replaced by cultural ones. Of course, agriculture led to extinction of at least some mammal species, but replacing the forests by settlements with pastures, <b>meadows,</b> <b>orchards,</b> arable fields and structural elements increased the number of plant and animal species in the landscape. Several species were introduced from other continents...|$|R
50|$|With {{regulation}} of the Regierungspräsidium Stuttgart from 9 November 1999, the entire Teckberg with an area of 386.0 hectares was reported as nature reserve. It was managed to preserve and promote an unusually varied cultural landscape with wet and dry <b>meadows,</b> <b>orchards,</b> hedges, forest fringes, alleys, groves, solitary trees, rocks, caves, springs and rare natural forest communities. These habitats provide a quality habitat {{for a variety of}} partly endangered plant and animal species. In the versatile natural area botanists could show 464 different plant species.|$|R

40|$|Landscape {{elements}} {{can enhance}} the ecological and social value of agricultural landscapes. <b>Orchard</b> <b>meadows</b> are traditional landscape elements in Central Europe, but have deteriorated for decades due to their adverse economic effects. We apply an integrated modelling framework to assess the farm profitability of <b>orchard</b> <b>meadows</b> {{as well as the}} effectiveness of measures in the Austrian agri-environmental programme to maintain existing and establish new sites. The model results indicate that current market prices for fruits and harvest productivity levels are not sufficient to support the maintenance of existing sites. The model results also indicate that the agri-environmental measures are effective in maintaining <b>orchard</b> <b>meadows,</b> but are insufficient to make all existing sites profitable or support further establishments. Consequently, alternative policy options will aim at increasing harvest efficiencies (e. g. harvest mechanisation co-operatives), at adding value to orchard fruits (e. g. fruit processing options), and at reducing labour costs by improving seasonal labour availability. landscape structure assessment, landscape element analysis, integrated modelling analysis, <b>orchard</b> <b>meadows</b> (streuobstwiesen), Austria, cultural landscapes,...|$|R

50|$|Nackenheim lies in Rhenish Hesse near Mainz. It {{belongs to}} the Verbandsgemeinde of Bodenheim, whose seat is in the like-named {{municipality}}, {{and is the only}} Ortsgemeinde in this Verbandsgemeinde that lies right on the Rhine. It is a municipality idyllically set between hillside vineyards on the one side and the Rhine on the other, whose vineyards were first mentioned more than 1,200 years ago. The islands of Kisselwörth (35 ha) and Sändchen cut Nackenheim off from the Rhine’s mainstream. The two islands have conservation status and belong to the Rheinauen (“Rhine Floodplains”) Habitats Directive area. Formerly, the area was under cultivation, but nowadays, <b>meadow</b> <b>orchards</b> (Streuobstwiesen) are found there. In the course of the Rhine straightening project in the 19th century, Kisselwörth and Sändchen were enlarged with landfill and current control works.|$|R
50|$|The gau {{landscape}} is mainly characterised by heavy muschelkalk soils. In {{the area of}} the villages of Borg, Oberleuken, Büschdorf, Eft-Hellendorf, Sinz, Münzingen, Kesslingen and Faha crops are grown and it is described as the breadbasket of the Saarland. This intensively farmed region extends into Rhineland-Palatinate which borders it to the north, especially around the villages of Merzkirchen, Fisch and Mannebach (near Saarburg). In addition, there are <b>meadow</b> <b>orchards</b> everywhere and, immediately around the villages of Tettingen-Butzdorf and Borg commercial fruit is grown. The Viezstraße road runs over the Saargau. The steep hillsides of the eastern foothills of the Saargau that descend towards the Saar are mostly covered in woods. In the northern area around the Saarburg there are also vineyards where the well known Rhineland-Palatine Saar Riesling is grown.|$|R
