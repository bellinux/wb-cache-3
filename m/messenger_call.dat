The faded remains of the logos for [...] "E.C.Simmons - Keen Kutter" [...] and the subsequent owners [...] "Harwi" [...] can still be seen today (2013). The tower's more practical purpose was to hold [...] of water that could be delivered to sprinklers on each of the four floors {{in the event of a}} fire. This was a modern purpose-built building that is estimated to have cost $250,000 at the time of its construction. The design included electric elevators, an internal telephone system and <b>messenger</b> <b>call</b> boxes. An unusual part of the design was the offices, which were situated to maximize their use of natural light. These offices were placed in a 17 ft wide strip that stretched 150 ft along the south side of the first (ground level) and second stories. On the ground floor was a sample room where the company's goods were displayed and a room with easy chairs that was available to both customers and employees. The Simmons company designed their buildings for efficiency and were known to employ the leading time and motion pioneer Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr.|$|E

50|$|Alpha-synuclein is {{a protein}} that is {{abundant}} in the human brain. Smaller amounts {{are found in the}} heart, muscles, and other tissues. In the brain, alpha-synuclein is found mainly at the tips of nerve cells (neurons) in specialized structures called presynaptic terminals. Within these structures, alpha-synuclein interacts with phospholipids and proteins. Presynaptic terminals release chemical <b>messengers,</b> <b>called</b> neurotransmitters, from compartments known as synaptic vesicles. The release of neurotransmitters relays signals between neurons and is critical for normal brain function.|$|R

Rapidly after exo-cytosis, the synaptic vesicle membranes are internal-ized and reutilized for the formation of new synaptic vesicles that are reloaded with neurotransmitters f om the cytosol (McPherson and De Camilli 1994).
