5|$|Eunuchs gained {{unprecedented}} {{power over}} state affairs during the Ming dynasty. One {{of the most}} effective <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> was the secret service stationed in what was called the Eastern Depot {{at the beginning of the}} dynasty, later the Western Depot. This secret service was overseen by the Directorate of Ceremonial, hence this state organ's often totalitarian affiliation. Eunuchs had ranks that were equivalent to civil service ranks, only theirs had four grades instead of nine.|$|E
5|$|Options for {{population}} control include fertility control, ground and helicopter shooting, and mustering and trapping. None {{of the methods}} provide complete freedom from suffering for the horses, {{and the cost of}} each is very high. The costs include those that are economic, such as research, equipment purchases, and labour expenditures, as well as moral concerns over the welfare of the horses. As a result, more effective and efficient <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> have been called for.|$|E
5|$|Shooting {{by trained}} marksmen is {{considered}} to be the most practical method of control due to its effectiveness. The NSW Department of Primary Industries believe shooting is the preferred method of population control as it does not subject the horses to the stresses of mustering, yarding, and long-distance transportation, all of which are related to 'capture and removal' methods. Horses that are only initially wounded from shooting are tracked and dispatched if they are in accessible, open country. However, shooting of horses in mountain ranges is not regarded as a humane <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> Helicopter shootings allow for aerial reconnaissance of a large area to target the densest populations, and shooters may get close enough to the target animals to ensure termination. This method is considered the most effective and cost efficient <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> but disapproval is high amongst those that believe it is inhumane. Organizations supporting Brumbies argue that aerial shooting is unnecessary and that alternative population control methods have not been given adequate trials, while government officials express concern about the need to control rapidly growing populations in order to avoid ecological problems associated with too many feral horses in certain areas.|$|E

Swarms have devastated crops and been a contributory cause of famines and human migrations. More recently, changes in agricultural practices and better surveillance of locations where swarms tend to originate, have meant that control measures can be used at an early stage.

25|$|Economic {{abuse is}} a form of abuse when one {{intimate}} partner has control over the other partner's access to economic resources. Marital assets are used as a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> Economic abuse may involve preventing a spouse from resource acquisition, limiting what the victim may use, or by otherwise exploiting economic resources of the victim. Economic abuse diminishes the victim's capacity to support themselves, increasing dependence on the perpetrator, including reduced access to education, employment, career advancement, and assets acquirement. Forcing or pressuring a family member to sign documents, to sell things, or to change a will are forms of economic abuse.|$|E

25|$|As {{tactical}} {{air strikes}} {{began to be}} used in Laos, it became apparent that for the safety of noncombatants, some <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> was necessary. Beginning at least as early as July 1964, the absence of a close air support control system caused a variety of enterprising individuals to improvise procedures for marking bombing targets. At various times, ground markers (including bamboo arrows) and dropped smoke grenades were used. While some of these individuals had military training, such as the American Army Attaché, others had little or no specialized training in close air support. They varied in nationality, being Thai, Lao, or Hmong, as well as American. Both Continental Air Services, Inc and Air America pilots would sometimes serve as ad hoc forward air controllers.|$|E
25|$|Crown gall disease {{caused by}} Agrobacterium tumefaciens can be {{controlled}} via {{a variety of different}} methods. The best <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> for this disease is by taking preventative measures, such as sterilizing pruning tools if these tools are used on infected trees and shrubs, performing mandatory inspections of nursery stock and rejecting infected plants as well as not planting susceptible plants in infected fields. Another useful practice is to avoid wounding the crowns/roots of the plants during cultivation, such as budding and not grafting plants, since wounds are the main means of bacterial entry. Control of root-chewing insects is also helpful to reduce levels of infection. It is recommended that infected plant material be burned rather than placed in a compost pile due to the bacteria's ability to live in the soil for many years.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between the provincial government and the crown-appointed governor was often difficult and contentious. The governors sought to assert the royal prerogatives granted in the provincial charter, and the provincial government sought to strip or minimize the governor's power. For example, each governor was ordered to enact legislation for providing permanent salaries for crown officials, but the legislature refused to do so, using its ability to grant stipends annually as a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> over the governor. The province's periodic issuance of paper currency was also a persistent source of friction between factions in the province, due to its inflationary effects. Notable royal governors during this period were Joseph Dudley, Thomas Hutchinson, Jonathan Belcher, Francis Bernard, and General Thomas Gage. Gage was the last British governor of Massachusetts, and his effective rule extended {{to little more than}} Boston.|$|E
