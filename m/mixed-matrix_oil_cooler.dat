5000|$|A minor {{problem was}} the oil hose from {{the lower part of}} the engine to the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler.</b> This was too short since a running engine was moving {{separate}} from the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler.</b> This hose was almost solid being under pressure and in time the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> would crack. This was solved by connecting the oil hoses for the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> to and from the engine [...] "up side down" [...] to make the lower hose, now connecting to the top of the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler,</b> longer and movable.|$|R

50|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>cooling</b> {{is the use}} {{of engine}} oil as a coolant, {{typically}} to remove surplus heat from an internal combustion engine. The hot engine transfers heat to the oil which then usually passes through a heat-exchanger, typically a type of radiator known as an <b>oil</b> <b>cooler.</b> The <b>cooled</b> <b>oil</b> flows back into the hot object to cool it continuously.|$|R

50|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>cooling</b> is {{commonly}} used to cool high-performance motorcycle engines that are not liquid-cooled. Typically, the cylinder barrel remains air-cooled in the traditional motorcycle fashion, but the cylinder head benefits from additional cooling. As there is already an oil circulation system available for lubrication, this oil is also piped to the cylinder head and used as a liquid coolant. Compared to an oil system used solely for lubrication, <b>oil</b> <b>cooling</b> requires additional <b>oil</b> capacity, a greater flow rate through the oil pump, and an <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> (or a larger cooler than normal).|$|R

50|$|The {{reasons for}} this complex system were threefold. One was to {{eliminate}} any extra aerodynamic drag that a protruding <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> would produce, in this case eliminating the extra drag factor by enclosing it within the engine's forward cowling. The second was to warm the air before it flowed to the oil cooler's circular-shaped core to aid warming the oil during starting. Finally, by placing the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> behind the fan, cooling was provided even while the aircraft was parked. The downside to this design was that the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> was in an extremely vulnerable location, and the metal ring was increasingly armoured as the war progressed.|$|R

5000|$|... / - The {{sources of}} the main issues with the 6.0L were the {{in-block}} <b>oil</b> <b>cooler,</b> and the EGR <b>cooler</b> materials. The <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> {{is located in the}} valley of the engine block, underneath the cartridge oil filter set up. The sealed outer portion of the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> is submerged in engine oil, with coolant flowing through the center passages. Over time, the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> will develop small cracks in the aluminum tubes from the constant heating and cooling of the engine. This situation usually results in oil pushing it's way into the cooling system. The sludge created from the mixture of oil and coolant creates a high pressure environment in the EGR cooler (due to the viscosity change in the coolant), leading to cracking of the EGR cooler's coolant passages. Once the EGR cooler cracks, it begins to leak coolant into the intake system and is then routed into the engine's cylinders to be burnt. The burning of coolant in the cylinders then causes a steam buildup, thus increasing cylinder pressures and the stretching of the head bolts; which leads to head gasket failure. The early EGR coolers (2003-2004.5) were also susceptible to pre-mature failure without <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> issues, also resulting in head gasket failure.|$|R

40|$|Two {{case studies}} {{completed}} {{under the direction}} of Jacobs Engineering are presented and discussed. In the first case study, the economics of the installation of an <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> are examined. A vapor recovery unit (VRU) for an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) facility in Grieve, WY, will be installed to capture the vapors from an oil tank. With the installation of the VRU, a question arose: would an <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> proposed to be installed before the oil tank be necessary? A simulation and economic analysis of the process suggests that <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> installation is still economically favorable. When the low pressure (LP) separator is operated at the typical temperature of 140 °F, nine additional barrels of oil per day (BOPD) are recovered through the use of an <b>oil</b> <b>cooler.</b> The net present worth (NPW) of <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> installation is calculated to be 248, 000. In the second case study, an overfill protection line was proposed to be installed for a gas flotation unit on an offshore oil rig. It was postulated {{that there might be a}} risk of hydrocarbon diffusion through the stagnant liquid in the line, presenting a hazard to equipment and personnel. Calculations were performed to approximate the rate of gas flux through the line. As the physical situation is difficult to model without precise information, alternative preventative methods are presented. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The plate heat {{exchanger}} in <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> of unit 2 in a thermal power plant became corrosion perforation after 2 -year running, and severe pits were found on its surface. The material and scale composition of the lubricating <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> was analyzed, and {{it was found that}} the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> was made of 304 stainless steel, instead of the 316 stainless steel provided by factory. The corrosion products on the corroded surface were composed of some characteristic elements in cooling water.
