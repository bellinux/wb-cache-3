40|$|Single {{junction}} GaAs {{solar cells}} have already attained an efficiency of 19 % AMO which {{could potentially be}} increased to approx 20 %, with some optimization. To achieve the higher efficiency the concept of multibandgap solar cells which utilizes a wider region of the solar spectrum should be sed. One of the materials for fabricating the top cell in a <b>multibandgap</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> is AlGaAs because it is compatible with GaAs in bandgap and lattice match. This {{is a very important}} consideration from the materials technology point of view, and the viability of this approach is evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Modifications to the {{reference}} concept were studied {{and the best}} approaches defined. The impact of the high efficiency multibandgap solar array on {{the reference}} concept design is considered. System trade studies for several solid state concepts, including the sandwich concept and a separate antenna/solar concept, are described. Two solid state concepts were selected and a design definition is presented for each. Magnetrons {{as an alternative to}} the reference klystrons for dc/RF conversion are evaluated. System definitions are presented for the preferred klystron and solid state concepts. Supporting systems are analyzed, with major analysis in the microwave, structures, and power distribution areas. Results of studies for thermal control, attitude control, stationkeeping, and details of a <b>multibandgap</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> study are included.

40|$|Abstract—Efficient {{external}} luminescence is {{a prerequisite}} for high-voltage solar cells. To approach the Shockley–Queisser limit, a highly reflective rear mirror is required. This mirror enhances the voltage of the solar cell by providing internally luminescent photons with multiple opportunities for escaping out the front sur-face. Likewise, intermediate reflectors in a <b>multibandgap</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> can assist external luminescence to enhance the voltage for each cell in a stack. These intermediate reflectors must also transmit the subbandgap photons to the next cell in the stack. A practi-cal implementation of an intermediate selective reflector is an air gap sandwiched by antireflection coatings. The air gap provides perfect reflection for angles outside the escape cone, and the an-tireflection coating transmits angles inside the escape cone. As the incoming sunlight is within the escape cone, it is transmitted on to the next cell, while most of the internally trapped luminescence is reflected. We calculate that air gap intermediate reflectors, along with a rear mirror, can provide an absolute efficiency increase of 5 % in multibandgap cells. Index Terms—Detailed balance limit, intermediate reflector, mirror, multijunction solar cell, quasi-equilibrium. I...|$|E

Such high-efficiency modules utilize multibandgap structures. To achieve module efficiencies significantly above 30 percent, {{it is necessary}} to employ different concepts such as spectral compression and broad-band detection.

40|$|Requirements {{for prime}} power {{generation}} from solar arrays are expected to increase {{for the next generation}} of spacecraft power systems. An enhancement of the efficiency of the conversion of incident sunlight to electricity would have a number of advantages, provided the cost involved in achieving this enhancement would not be too great. Solar input response can be improved by splitting the solar spectrum into component wavelength bands and directing these bands to <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> of different bandgaps. Two approaches have been proposed for achieving spectrum splitting photovoltaics.

40|$|The present {{stature and}} current {{research}} directions of photovoltaic arrays as primary power systems for space are reviewed. There {{have recently been}} great advances in the technology of thin-film <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> for terrestrial applications. In a thin-film <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> {{the thickness of the}} active element is only a few microns; transfer of this technology to space arrays could result in ultralow-weight solar arrays with potentially large gains in specific power. Recent advances in thin-film <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> are reviewed, including polycrystalline copper-indium selenide (CuInSe 2) and related I-III-VI 2 compounds, polycrystalline cadmium telluride and related II-VI compounds, and amorphous silicon:hydrogen and alloys. The best experimental efficiency on thin-film <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> to date is 12 percent AMO for CuIn Se 2. This efficiency is likely to be increased in the next few years. The radiation tolerance of thin-film materials is far greater than that of single-crystal materials. CuIn Se 2 shows no degradation when exposed to 1 MeV electrons. Experimental evidence also suggests that most of all of the radiation damage on thin-films can be removed by a low temperature anneal. The possibility of thin-film <b>multibandgap</b> cascade <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> is discussed, including the tradeoffs between monolithic and mechanically stacked cells. The best current efficiency for a cascade is 12. 5 percent AMO for an amorphous silicon on CuInSe 2 multibandgap combination. Higher efficiencies are expected in the future.

Stand-alone {{transparent}} Si <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> and {{low band}} gap Si:Ge <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> {{can be applied}} together in a high performance multi-junction <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> system to absorb the middle and long wavelength light. In this system, optics needs to be designed carefully for {{the back side of}} transparent Si <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> to optimize the long wavelength light transmission. Photon losses cannot be eliminated in the stand-alone system. In this thesis a 3 -terminal Si-Si:Ge monolithic tandem <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> consisting of a top silicon <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> and a bottom Si:Ge <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> sharing a common base, which can take advantage of both the silicon <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> and Si:Ge <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> and overcome the current mismatch effect and photon losses between Si <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> and Si:Ge <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> is designed, modeled and fabricated. It can replace independent Si <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> and Si:Ge <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> in a multi-junction <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> system. Modeling of 3 terminal Si-Si:Ge monolithic tandem <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> is done to find out its maximum efficiency. A modified PERL cell is put on top of the modeled structure because it's the world record silicon <b>solar</b> <b>cell.</b> Its thickness is modified to analyze the effects of near band edge absorption. There are three cases for the bottom Si:Ge <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> under modified PERL cell, the best fabricated device, product of the best measured parameters and the model of Si:Ge <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> 14. Modeling shows that 3 terminal Si-Si:Ge <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> outperforms PERL cell in most cases, and a thicker Si device leads to higher efficiency. The efficiency of 3 terminal Si-Si:Ge <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> with 800 um silicon substrate is 10 % relative and 2. 5 % absolute higher than PERL cell at 500 suns. Three groups of <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> are fabricated.
