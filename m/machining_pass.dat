50|$|Inconel is a {{difficult}} metal to shape and machine using traditional techniques due to rapid work hardening. After the first <b>machining</b> <b>pass,</b> work hardening tends to plastically deform either the workpiece or the tool on subsequent passes. For this reason, age-hardened Inconels such as 718 are machined using an aggressive but slow cut with a hard tool, minimizing the number of passes required. Alternatively, {{the majority of the}} machining can be performed with the workpiece in a solutionized form, with only the final steps being performed after age hardening.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{analysis}} of vibrations on surface roughness generated during boring with {{the application of the}} conventional boring tool and one with the damper is presented. The experiments included the measurement of vibration accelerations carried out with the piezoelectric sensor, as well as the evaluation of surface roughness parameters after each <b>machining</b> <b>pass.</b> The obtained results reveal that in the investigated range, no stability loss was found. Furthermore, the growth of the rotational speed induces the increase of vibration level, as well as the growth {{of the differences between the}} vibration values generated during boring with the conventional tool and one equipped with damper. Vibrations have also the direct influence on the machined surface roughness. In case of the tool equipped with the damper, the tool’s overhang L had more intense influence than rotational speed n. However, for the conventional boring tool this dependency was unequivocal...|$|E

In region machining, neighbouring regions may be close together, but disconnected. Boundary curves may also have unwanted geometric artifacts caused by approximation and discretisation. We present a strategy to improve the topology and geometry of such boundary curves, allowing the generation of better tool paths, and in turn, improved tool wear and surface quality of the machined part. We make such improvements in three steps: firstly, disconnected regions are merged where appropriate, using a method based on morphological operations from image processing. Secondly, boundary segments with undesirable geometric properties are identified and replaced by simpler segments, using a vertex deletion operation. Finally, flaws at a smaller geometric scale are removed, using a curve shortening algorithm. Experimental results are given to illustrate our algorithm...|$|E

30|$|Displacement of the {{foundation}} in the horizontal and longitudinal directions as well as vertical ground settlement occurs when the shield tunneling <b>machine</b> <b>passes</b> close to {{the foundation}}. In general, the closer {{the distance between the}} foundation and the tunnel, the greater the displacement or settlement will be. The horizontal displacement is small and achieves the greatest value when the cutting face passes close by. The displacement along the machine driving direction is bigger than that in the horizontal direction. It is affected significantly by the thrust force of the shield machine because most of the displacement occurs during or before the shield <b>machine</b> <b>passes.</b> Most of the ground settlement and its maximum magnitude occurred during or after the shield <b>machine</b> <b>passed.</b> Uneven settlement {{at the bottom of the}} spread foundation occurred during the excavation and peaked after the driving finished. The shorter the distance to the tunnel, the larger the uneven settlement will be.|$|R
40|$|Machining of {{aerospace}} structural components involves many thin-wall rib and flange sections. These thin-wall sections are {{dictated by}} design consideration to meet required strength and weight constraints. These components are either forged or cast to the approximate final shape {{and the end}} milling process is used to finish the parts. Alternatively, the component is machined from a solid block of material by end milling with roughing and finishing cuts. During machining, the cutting forces cause deflection of the thin-wall section, leading to dimensional form errors that cause the finished part {{to be out of}} specification. In this thesis, a new methodology for the prediction of wall deflection during machining of thin-wall feature is presented. The new methodology aims to increase the efficiency on modelling the deflection prediction in machining thin-wall component. The prediction methodology is based on a combination of finite element method and statistical analysis. It consists of a feature based approach of parts creation, finite element analysis of material removal and statistical regression analysis of deflection associated with cutting parameters and component attributes. The model is developed {{to take into account the}} tool-work geometries on material removal process during machining process. Mathematical models are developed for the wall deflection correlated with cutting parameters and component attributes. The prediction values have been validated by machining tests on titanium alloys parts and show good agreement between simulation model and experimental data. In addition, the cutter compensation method derived from the deflection prediction values can be used to reduce the magnitude of surface error, thus improving the component accuracy for machining thin-wall feature. By adopting the cutter compensation method, only one <b>machining</b> <b>pass</b> is required to machine the thin-wall feature. This compares favourably to the current practice in step method which requires many machining passes. All research results have been derived for four different cases of typical aerospace component, but it is shown that these results can be applicable for other component shape and materials. To assist commercial applications, a customized computer program has been developed for the hybrid model. The computer program is an integrated data exchanges between modules upon users input on the design information and machining parameter for automatically generate the solid model, material removal model and FEM analysis. The new method is able to reduce the analysis time from weeks to hours...|$|E

40|$|The use of skidders {{equipped}} with rubber tires {{is a well}} accepted practice for the extraction of timber from the forest, but the application also causes considerable environmental problems. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the effects of different slope gradient, number of <b>machine</b> <b>passes</b> on skid trails and soil depth on soil compaction. The study was designed as an experiment with the factors including slope gradient, soil moisture, and soil depth on various skid trails and with different number of <b>machine</b> <b>passes.</b> The effects of four slope classes (flat, 10 %, - 10 % and - 20 %), three soil depth classes (5, 15 and 25 cm), and different compaction levels based on various number of <b>machine</b> <b>passes</b> (0, 1, 5, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30) were evaluated. A Timberjack cable skidder was used and the study location was in the Kheyrud Educational and Research Forest located in the Hyrcanian forest in northern Iran. The increased number of <b>machine</b> <b>passes</b> increased soil bulk density, but the highest rate of compaction occurred after the initial few passes. Uphill skidding increases soil compaction more than downhill skidding. The increases in bulk density were still significant at the maximum sampling depth of 20 – 30 cm. Soil bulk densities at 5, 15 and 25 cm depth averaged 35, 22 and 17 % higher than densities of undisturbed soil...|$|R
