Native throughout the temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, Amanita muscaria has been unintentionally introduced to many countries in the Southern Hemisphere, generally as a symbiont with pine and birch plantations, and is now a true cosmopolitan species. It associates with various deciduous and coniferous trees.|$|E

5|$|Babb is {{best known}} for his {{presentation}} of exploitation films, a term <b>many</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> business would embrace.

His expenses were estimated at 5% for selling, and his distribution overhead near 7%, resulting in some of the largest per-dollar returns in the film industry.|$|E

Kertész, too, was dispensed with when he sought control of all artistic matters; his contract was not renewed when it expired in 1968. His successor as principal conductor was André Previn, who held the post for 11 years – at 2013 the longest tenure of the post to date.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its role}} in {{establishing}} the General Synod, the Pennsylvania Ministerium withdrew from the inter-Lutheran organization in 1823. Within the Ministerium, there was a close relationship between Lutheran and Reformed congregations, and many felt that the General Synod might jeopardize that relationship. In addition, <b>many</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ministerium were wary of a centralized organization, and the control that it might exert over individual congregations.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{this shift}} in thought about the {{underlying}} mechanisms in plantar fasciitis, <b>many</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> academic community have stated the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis.

5|$|A severe depression, the Panic of 1873, {{began in}} the same year as passage of the act, and persisted for much of the decade. <b>Many</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States came to believe the gold {{standard}} too rigid to deal with economic hard times like those, and sought to restore bimetallism. The inflation caused by such a policy would enable debtors to repay what they owed more easily. The price of silver continued to fall—the silver in a dollar in the new metric-weight subsidiary silver coins was worth only $.75 by mid-1876, though the price recovered some after that.|$|E
5|$|A two-day {{political}} crisis followed the raid. It {{was obvious to}} the Ottoman government what Enver had allowed to occur.

Several officials, including the Grand Vizier, threatened to resign in protest. Four later would, including Djavid Bey. Though <b>many</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> government thought it opportune to attack Russia, solidarity was regarded as vital and a letter of apology was soon drafted.

5|$|A-10s were {{initially}} an unwelcome addition to <b>many</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Air Force. Most pilots switching to the A-10 {{did not want}} to because fighter pilots traditionally favored speed and appearance. In 1987, many A-10s were shifted to the forward air control (FAC) role and redesignated OA-10. In the FAC role, the OA-10 is typically equipped with up to six pods of 2.75inch (70mm) Hydra rockets, usually with smoke or white phosphorus warheads used for target marking. OA-10s are physically unchanged and remain fully combat capable despite the redesignation.|$|E
5|$|After {{the novel}} was published, it caused {{considerable}} discussion. Religious thinkers, Marxist-Leninists, and anarchists decried the novel for not explaining their ideologies in more detail, but literary figures and <b>many</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general public praised it; this positive reception {{may have been}} influenced by the nascent government's need to promote literature for nation-building. Atheis was translated into Malay before 1970 and into English in 1972; it was also adapted into a film with the same title in 1974. The novel, which received an award from the Indonesian government in 1969, is one of the UNESCO Collection of Representative Works.|$|E
5|$|Agharta is a 1975 live double album by American jazz trumpeter, composer, and bandleader Miles Davis. By {{the time}} he {{recorded}} the album, Davis was 48 {{years old and had}} alienated <b>many</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jazz community while attracting younger rock audiences with his radical electric fusion music. After experimenting with different line-ups, he established a stable live band in 1973 and toured constantly for the next two years, despite physical pain from worsening health and emotional instability brought on by substance abuse. During a three-week tour of Japan in 1975, the trumpeter performed two concerts at the Festival Hall in Osaka on February 1; the afternoon show produced Agharta and the evening show was released as Pangaea the following year.|$|E
