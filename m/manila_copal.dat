5000|$|Results {{illustrated}} that {{objects were}} multi-layer structured, the lacquer layer was mainly composed of aged laccol with some urushiol, drying oil and cedrol oil, the coating {{was based on}} oxidised shellac and oil-resinous varnish composed of linseed oil and <b>Manila</b> <b>copal</b> among the Chinese lacquers. Heat-bodied linseed oil, oxidised shellac, aged urushiol and soot or tar were also detected in the Japanese panels. As for the European ones, traces of pine pitch or pine resins were found in addition to linseed oil.|$|E
5000|$|Gum copal, {{also known}} as <b>manila</b> <b>copal,</b> is a resin {{produced}} by the sap of the forest tree (Daniellia sp.), due to common impurities and differences in regions, gum copal ranges in colors from blacks to yellows to whites. Gum copal, along with ivory and slaves, was a significant export from East Africa in the nineteenth century. Gum copal exists in a state {{very similar to that}} of amber but with some primary differences. It is commonly mistaken for amber and oftentimes sold at gem shows or other areas as amber. Unlike amber, gum copal is usually only 100-1,000 years old and it has not yet fossilized. [...] Gum copal usually sells for $750-$1500 USD per metric ton in rock form and $1500-$6500 USD Per metric ton in powder form.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{optimize}} chromatographic analysis of European lacquer, thermochemolysis temperature was evaluated {{for the analysis}} of natural resins. Five main ingredients of lacquer were studied: sandarac, mastic, colophony, <b>Manila</b> <b>copal</b> and Congo copal. For each, five temperature programs were tested: four fixed temperatures (350, 480, 550, 650 degrees C) and one ultrafast thermal desorption (UFD), in which the temperature rises from 350 to 660 degrees C in 1 min. In total, the integrated signals of 27 molecules, partially characterizing the five resins, were monitored to compare the different methods. A compromise between detection of compounds released at low temperatures and compounds formed at high temperatures was searched. 650 degrees C is too high for both groups, 350 degrees C is best for the first, and 550 degrees C for the second. Fixed temperatures of 480 degrees C or UFD proved to be a consensus in order to detect most marker molecules. UFD was slightly better for the molecules released at low temperatures, while 480 degrees C showed best compounds formed at high temperatures...|$|E
