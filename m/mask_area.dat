40|$|We have {{selectively}} grown thin epitaxial GaAs {{films on}} Ge substrates {{with the aid}} of a 200 nm thin SiO 2 mask layer. The selectively grown structures have lateral sizes ranging from 1 mu m width up to large areas of 1 x 1 mm(2). The growth with the standard growth procedure for GaAs growth on Ge substrates reveals a limited amount of GaAs nucleation on the <b>mask</b> <b>area</b> and strong loading effects caused by diffusion of group III precursors over the <b>mask</b> <b>area</b> and in the gas phase. Reduction of the growth pressure inhibits GaAs nucleation on the <b>mask</b> <b>area</b> and reduces the loading effects strongly, but favors the creation of anti-phase domains (APDs) in the GaAs. An optimized growth procedure was developed, consisting of a 13 nm thin nucleation layer grown at high pressure, followed by low-pressure growth of GaAs. This optimized growth procedure inhibits the nucleation of GaAs on the <b>mask</b> <b>area</b> and is a good compromise between reduction of loading effects and inhibition of APD growth in the GaAs.

40|$|This study {{questions}} {{the effectiveness of}} masking faces by means of pixelation on television or in newspapers. Previous {{studies have shown that}} masking just the face leads to unacceptably high recognition levels, making it likely that participants also use other cues for recognition, such as hairstyle or clothes. In the current study we investigate this possibility by means of an identification task in which participants had to identify (partially) masked images of familiar people. To demonstrate that non-facial cues become increasingly important for recognition as faces are masked more strongly, we manipulated the size of the <b>masked</b> <b>area</b> and the degree of pixelation. Confirming our expectations, increasing the size of <b>masked</b> <b>area</b> or its level of deterioration led to lower recognition rates. More importantly, also an interaction effect between the two variables emerged, showing that additional visual information partly compensates the downswing in recognition when masking becomes stronger. Although in some conditions low recognition rates were found, masking was never a hundred percent effective, making it clear that the media should approach this issue with care.

40|$|The {{statistics}} of shear peaks {{have been shown}} to provide valuable cosmological information beyond the power spectrum, and will be an important constraint of models of cosmology with the large survey areas provided by forthcoming astronomical surveys. Surveys include <b>masked</b> <b>areas</b> due to bright stars, bad pixels etc, which must be accounted for in producing constraints on cosmology from shear maps. We advocate a forward-modeling approach, where the impact of masking (and other survey artifacts) are accounted for in the theoretical prediction of cosmological parameters, rather than removed from survey data. We use masks based on the Deep Lens Survey, and explore the impact of up to 37 % of the survey <b>area</b> being <b>masked</b> on LSST and DES-scale surveys. By reconstructing maps of aperture mass, the masking effect is smoothed out, resulting in up to 14 % smaller statistical uncertainties compared to simply reducing the survey <b>area</b> by the <b>masked</b> <b>area.</b> We show that, even in the presence of large survey masks, the bias in cosmological parameter estimation produced in the forward-modeling process is ~ 1 %, dominated by bias caused by limited simulation volume. We also explore how this potential bias scales with survey area and find that small survey areas are more significantly impacted by the differences in cosmological structure in the data and simulated volumes, due to cosmic variance.

40|$|The intima-media {{thickness}} (IMT) of {{the common}} carotid artery (CCA) is widely used as an early indicator of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Typically, the IMT grows with age and this {{is used as a}} sign of increased risk of CVD. Beyond thickness, there is also clinical interest in identifying how the composition and texture of the intima-media complex (IMC) changed and how these textural changes grow into atherosclerotic plaques that can cause stroke. Clearly though texture analysis of ultrasound images can be greatly affected by speckle noise, our goal here is to develop effective despeckle noise methods that can recover image texture associated with increased rates of atherosclerosis disease. In this study, we perform a comparative evaluation of several despeckle filtering methods, on 100 ultrasound images of the CCA, based on the extracted multiscale Amplitude-Modulation Frequency-Modulation (AM-FM) texture features and visual image quality assessment by two clinical experts.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{improving}} the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) while maintaining the − 6 dB axial resolution of ultrasonic B-mode images is proposed. The technique proposed is known as eREC-FC, which enhances a recently developed REC-FC technique. REC-FC {{is a combination of}} the coded excitation technique known as resolution enhancement compression (REC) and the speckle-reduction technique frequency compounding (FC). In REC-FC, image CNR is improved but at the expense of a reduction in axial resolution. However, by compounding various REC-FC images made from various subband widths, the tradeoff between axial resolution and CNR enhancement can be extended. Further improvements in CNR can be obtained by applying postprocessing despeckling filters to the eREC-FC B-mode images. The despeckling filters evaluated were the following: median, Lee, homogeneous <b>mask</b> <b>area,</b> geometric, and speckle-reducing anisotropic diffusion (SRAD). Simulations and experimental measurements were conducted with a single-element transducer (f/ 2. 66) having a center frequency of 2. 25 [*]MHz and a − 3 dB bandwidth of 50 %. In simulations and experiments, the eREC-FC technique resulted in the same axial resolution that would be typically observed with conventional excitation with a pulse. Moreover, increases in CNR of 348 % were obtained in experiments when comparing eREC-FC with a Lee filter to conventional pulsing methods...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A {{technique}} {{for improvement of}} ultrasonic B-mode imaging that uses coded excitation, pulse compression, and frequency compounding was developed. A coded excitation and pulse compression technique known as resolution enhancement compression (REC) was used to enhance the bandwidth of an imaging system {{by a factor of}} two. This bandwidth was subdivided into smaller subbands through the speckle-reducing technique known as frequency compounding (REC-FC). Frequency compounded images were generated using various subband widths and then averaged to reduce speckle and to improve contrast while preserving spatial resolution, known as enhanced REC-FC (eREC-FC). In this study, further improvements in contrast and reduction in speckle were obtained by applying post-processing despeckling filters. The following post-processing despeckling filters were explored and analyzed in regard to contrast improvement, speckle reduction, and image feature preservation: median, Lee, homogeneous <b>mask</b> <b>area,</b> geometric, and speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion (SRAD). To quantify the performance of each filter, contrast-to-noise ratio was used. Data from thirty simulated phantoms and experimental data from a tissue-mimicking phantom were generated and filtered. Results demonstrated that post-processing despeckling filters coupled with the eREC-FC technique could improve the image by up to 563 %, in terms of the contrast-to-noise ratio, when compared to conventional ultrasonic imaging.
