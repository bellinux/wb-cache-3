In a KSCN/ H 2 O (1 / 10 <b>molar</b> ratio) <b>solution,</b> 90 % {{of the initial}} excitation of the CN stretch (∼ 2066 cm− 1) of the SCN − anion is transferred to the HOH bending mode (∼ 1636 cm− 1) of water molecules with an energy transfer time constant 3. 1 ps. In a NH 4 SCN/H 2 O (1 / 10 <b>molar</b> ratio) <b>solution,</b> only 49 % of the CN excitation flows to the water HOH bending mode with a time constant 6. 3 ps. Most of the remaining CN excitation goes to the NH bending mode (∼ 1460 cm− 1) of the NH+ cation with a time constant of 7. 0 ps. The results indicate that about 50 % of the energy transfer channel from the CN stretch to the HOH bending observed in the KSCN solution is overpowered by the NH 4 + cations in the NH 4 SCN/H 2 O solution. Ion concentration dependent measurements support this argument. According to the dipole/dipole approximation, the CN/OH energy transfer occurs most efficiently between SCN − anions and the water molecules closest to them. The experimental results therefore suggest that more than 50 % of the water molecules closest to the SCN − anions are replaced by the NH 4 + cations in the NH 4 SCN/H 2 O (1 / 10 <b>molar</b> ratio) <b>solution.</b> The percentage is {{much larger than the}} NH 4 +/water ratio of 10 %, indicating that the ion association between NH 4 + and SCN − is caused by the chemical nature of the solution rather than the statistical “forced contact ” because of the high ion concentration. 1...|$|R

Methods: The effect of some parameters such as kind of activator, pH (2 - 10), contact time (0 - 240 min), adsorbent dose (2 - 6 g/L) and initial concentration of MTBE (20 - 70 mg/L) was investigated on MTBE adsorption via activated carbon, after preparation of coal from wastewater sludge and activation of this coal via 3 <b>molar</b> <b>solution</b> of H 2 PO 4,  and KOH as well as 5 <b>molar</b> <b>solution</b> of ZnCl 2.

In addition, maximum removal efficiency (about 50 %) was obtained in acidic pH of 4, 6 g/L of activated carbon and 20 mg/L of MTBE concentration.
