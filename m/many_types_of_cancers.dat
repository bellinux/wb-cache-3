25|$|Many human tumors {{occur because}} of dysregulation of mTOR signaling, and can confer higher {{susceptibility}} to inhibitors of mTOR. Deregulations of multiple {{elements of the}} mTOR pathway, like PI3K amplification/mutation, PTEN loss of function, AKT overexpression, and S6K1, 4EBP1, and eIF4E overexpression have been related to <b>many</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancers.</b> Therefore, mTOR is an interesting therapeutic target for treating multiple cancers, both the mTOR inhibitors themselves or in combination with inhibitors of other pathways.|$|E
25|$|If a {{mutation}} {{is present}} in a germ cell, it can give rise to offspring that carries the mutation {{in all of its}} cells. This is the case in hereditary diseases. In particular, if there is a mutation in a DNA repair gene within a germ cell, humans carrying such germline mutations may have an increased risk of cancer. A list of 34 such germline mutations is given in the article DNA repair-deficiency disorder. An example of one is albinism, a mutation that occurs in the OCA1 or OCA2 gene. Individuals with this disorder are more prone to <b>many</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancers,</b> other disorders and have impaired vision. On the other hand, a mutation may occur in a somatic cell of an organism. Such mutations will be present in all descendants of this cell within the same organism, and certain mutations can cause the cell to become malignant, and, thus, cause cancer.|$|E

Multi-country ecological studies <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> incidence and mortality rates with respect to national diets have shown that some dietary factors such as animal products (meat, milk, fish and eggs), added sweeteners/sugar, and some fats appear to be {{risk factors for}} <b>many</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer,</b> while cereals/grains and vegetable products as a whole appear to be risk reduction factors for <b>many</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer.</b> Temporal changes in Japan in the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> common in Western developed countries {{have been linked to}} the nutrition transition to the Western diet.|$|R

50|$|Myc is {{activated}} upon various mitogenic signals such as serum stimulation or by Wnt, Shh and EGF (via the MAPK/ERK pathway).By modifying {{the expression of}} its target genes, Myc activation results in numerous biological effects. The first to be discovered was its capability to drive cell proliferation (upregulates cyclins, downregulates p21), but it also plays {{a very important role}} in regulating cell growth (upregulates ribosomal RNA and proteins), apoptosis (downregulates Bcl-2), differentiation, and stem cell self-renewal. Myc is a very strong proto-oncogene and it is very often found to be upregulated in <b>many</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancers.</b> Myc overexpression stimulates gene amplification, presumably through DNA over-replication.|$|E

50|$|Mutations in the {{epigenetic}} machinery {{itself may}} occur as well, potentially {{responsible for the}} changing epigenetic profiles of cancerous cells. The histone variants of the H2A family are highly conserved in mammals, playing critical roles in regulating many nuclear processes by altering chromatin structure. One of the key H2A variants, H2A.X, marks DNA damage, facilitating the recruitment of DNA repair proteins to restore genomic integrity. Another variant, H2A.Z, {{plays an important role}} in both gene activation and repression. A high level of H2A.Z expression is detected in many cancers and is significantly associated with cellular proliferation and genomic instability. Histone variant macroH2A1 is important in the pathogenesis of <b>many</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancers,</b> for instance in hepatocellular carcinoma. Other mechanisms include a decrease in H4K16ac may be caused by either a decrease in activity of a histone acetyltransferases (HATs) or an increase in deacetylation by SIRT1. Likewise, an inactivating frameshift mutation in HDAC2, a histone deacetylase that acts on many histone-tail lysines, has been associated with cancers showing altered histone acetylation patterns. These findings indicate a promising mechanism for altering epigenetic profiles through enzymatic inhibition or enhancement.|$|E
