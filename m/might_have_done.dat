5|$|Upon {{release in}} Japan, the game entered {{the top ten}} best-selling titles of the week at #3, with 21,445 units sold. It had a {{sell-through}} rate of just over 48%. The following week, it had dropped to #8, selling a further 8,436 units. By {{the end of the}} year, it was among the top 1000 best-selling games of 2011, with total sales of 46,834 units. At its debut in the United Kingdom, it performed poorly, reaching only #38 in the charts. According to Xseed, the game's sales in North America were favorable, although they were not on the same level as The Last Story. In an interview, Xseed said that it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> better if it had been released in the 2012 holiday season.|$|E

5|$|After the High Councillor's {{downfall}} and the regime's {{defeat in}} Metropolis, the Regime is dismantled {{and all of}} its accomplices are arrested. Harley Quinn has the Joker sent back to the prime universe after realizing that he does not care about her, Green Lantern hands over his counterpart and Sinestro to the Guardians of the Universe to stand trial, and Wonder Woman dethrones her counterpart. The dictator Superman is placed in a prison emitting red sun radiation that renders him powerless, and his prime counterpart admits that if he were placed in the same position, he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> the same thing. The alternate Batman tells Superman that he hopes that Superman never has to learn what he could be capable of if he turns evil, and warns him that if something ever happens to him, causing him to go down the path of his counterpart, he will come after him. As they walk away, the alternate Superman's eyes glow red, indicating he still has some degree of his powers.|$|E
5|$|John {{remained}} Lord of Ireland {{throughout his}} reign. He {{drew on the}} country for resources to fight his war with Philip on the continent. Conflict continued in Ireland between the Anglo-Norman settlers and the indigenous Irish chieftains, with John manipulating both groups to expand his wealth and power in the country. During Richard's rule, John had successfully increased {{the size of his}} lands in Ireland, and he continued this policy as king. In 1210 the king crossed into Ireland with a large army to crush a rebellion by the Anglo-Norman lords; he reasserted his control of the country and used a new charter to order compliance with English laws and customs in Ireland. John stopped short of trying to actively enforce this charter on the native Irish kingdoms, but historian David Carpenter suspects that he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so, had the baronial conflict in England not intervened. Simmering tensions remained with the native Irish leaders even after John left for England.|$|E

25|$|Shuttleworth's career {{never took}} off as it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> {{and loss of}} form, plus {{persistent}} injuries, forced him to leave Lancashire in 1975 and join Leicestershire, where he played forty-one matches between 1977 and 1980. In twelve seasons with Lancashire, Shuttleworth played in 177 matches and took 484 wickets {{at a cost of}} 22.92 each. He played in 105 limited-overs matches for the county and took 147 wickets at 18 apiece.|$|E
25|$|Captain George Parker assumed {{command of}} Santa Margarita in December 1796. On 21 June 1797 she {{captured}} the privateer San Francisco (alias Los Amigos) off the Irish coast. San Francisco was pierced for 14 guns {{and had a}} crew of 53 men. She was from St Sebastian and had cruised between Scilly and Cape Clear for 20 days without having captured anything. She was apparently quite new and sailed well. Parker observed that with better luck she <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> some mischief.|$|E

25|$|The Hyksos kingdom was {{centered}} in the eastern Nile Delta and central Egypt but relentlessly pushed south for the control of central and Upper Egypt. Around the time Memphis fell to the Hyksos, the native Egyptian ruling house in Thebes declared its independence and set itself up as the Sixteenth Dynasty. Another short lived dynasty <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> the same in central Egypt, profiting from the power vacuum created {{by the fall of}} the 13th dynasty and forming the Abydos Dynasty.|$|E
25|$|Again, like Salerno, {{there were}} serious {{problems}} with the landings. The commander, Lieutenant General John P. Lucas, did not exploit as aggressively as he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> and was relieved for it. Lucas believed {{that if he had}} pushed too far, his forces could have been cut off by the Germans. But as the whole purpose of the invasion was to attack the German lines behind Monte Cassino and break out into the Italian areas which were undefended, the idea that Lucas thought he should land then sit and do nothing is incredible. The Germans came even closer than Salerno to breaking up the beachhead. They pushed through the defences to the last line before the sea. Again massive firepower on the Allied side saved the beachhead.|$|E
25|$|The crew of HMS Haslemere spotted Johnson's {{parachute}} {{coming down}} and saw her alive in the water, calling for help. Conditions were poor – there was a heavy sea and a strong tide, snow was falling and it was intensely cold. Lt Cmdr Walter Fletcher, the commander of Haslemere, dived into the water {{in an attempt to}} rescue Johnson. Fletcher failed in the attempt. As a result of the intense cold he died in hospital days later. In 2016, Alec Gill, a historian, claimed that the son of a crew member stated that Johnson had died because she was sucked into the blades of the ship's propellers; the crewman did not observe this to occur, but only supposed that it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done.</b> This claim has not been verified, as Johnson's body was never recovered.|$|E

25|$|Bigfoot proponents Grover Krantz and Geoffrey H. Bourne {{believed}} that Bigfoot {{could be a}} relict population of Gigantopithecus. All Gigantopithecus fossils were found in Asia, but according to Bourne, many species of animals migrated across the Bering land bridge and he suggested that Gigantopithecus <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so, as well. Gigantopithecus fossils have not {{been found in the}} Americas. The only recovered fossils are of mandibles and teeth, leaving uncertainty about Gigantopithecus's locomotion. Krantz has argued that Gigantopithecus blacki could have been bipedal, based on his extrapolation of the shape of its mandible. However, the relevant part of the mandible is not present in any fossils. An alternative view is that Gigantopithecus was quadrupedal. The Gigantopithecus's enormous mass would have made it difficult for it to adopt a bipedal gait.|$|E
25|$|Information on Kliper's beyond LEO mission {{capabilities}} were expanded {{further by}} RSC Energia, {{with a picture}} released in December 2005 of what a possible Kliper interplanetary configuration might have looked like. The design was entirely theoretical but made for a view of where RSC Energia saw the Kliper operating, and how it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so. This configuration was unlike anything seen so far for a manned space vehicle, with the solar arrays needed for electrical power vastly bigger than the habitable volume at the centre. It was also unclear what the mode of propulsion was. The very large solar array suggested an ion propulsion system might have been contemplated for such a mission, though it might also simply be {{that there was another}} reason for such a large array, such as increased power for better telemetry transmission rates over large distances.|$|E
25|$|Churchill {{attracted}} ridicule. He {{was strongly}} criticised by “The Morning Post” (“a costly blunder for which Mr W. Churchill {{must be held}} responsible”) while Admiral Beatty wrote to his wife that Churchill had been “a darned fool” and “mad”. Asquith wrote to Venetia Stanley likening Churchill to a tiger which has “tasted blood” and who was hinting that he wanted other opportunities for a major field command, and that he preferred military glory to political success. By 13 October Asquith was writing of “the wicked folly of it all” and that Churchill had led “sheep to the shambles”. He faced criticism for his poor judgement from his wife Clementine (he missed {{the birth of his}} daughter Sarah), and in his later writing conceded that he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> things differently.The Dunkirk force was also wound up after others, including Asquith, grew irritated about it.|$|E

25|$|Born in London but {{brought up}} in West Wales, Evans joined Glamorgan in the mid 1950s and became first-choice wicketkeeper after the {{retirement}} of Haydn Davies {{at the end of}} the 1958 season. For several seasons at the start of the 1960s, he was at or near the top of the wicketkeeping lists of dismissals with 79, 82 and then 89 dismissals in the seasons from 1961 to 1963. The 89 dismissals in 1963 set a new county record for Glamorgan, though it has since been surpassed by Eifion Jones, and made him the leading wicketkeeper of the year. As a right-handed batsman, he was very much a tail-ender, though in a county side that had more than its fair share of rabbits, with Don Shepherd, Jeff Jones and Ossie Wheatley in the team, he often batted higher than he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> in other sides. He did not, though, pass 50 in any first-class innings.|$|E
25|$|While Weyl's {{biography}} paints {{an unpleasant}} picture of Fokker as a businessman, {{he was a}} popular and charismatic figure with service pilots and could charm even senior officers. This charm enabled him {{to deal with the}} first major crisis of his German career when his newly delivered Fokker Dr.I triplanes began to experience sudden fatal accidents in late 1917 and the type was temporarily grounded as too dangerous to fly. The triplanes' top wings frequently ripped off under aerobatic conditions and even Lothar von Richthofen (brother of Manfred) was lucky to survive one such crash. Fokker was able to prove to the German high command that the basic design was not at fault but the German military inquiry concluded that shoddy workmanship due to poor supervision and quality control at the Fokker factory were to blame. Fokker received a stern warning about future conduct. Unfortunately the same scenario repeated itself again, a few months later, with the introduction of his E.V/D.VIII monoplane in mid-1918. A further high level German inquiry revealed more production and workmanship issues. Weyl asserts that the German authorities were now willing to file criminal charges against Fokker and <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so, had he not returned to the Netherlands shortly after the end of World War I.|$|E
25|$|A {{let down}} {{followed}} in 1968. The year started badly when Hart was {{drafted into the}} army, which the club was able to defer for a year. Player and club performed {{in fits and starts}} for most of the year, before the team came roaring home, missing the finals by a whisker. A similar scenario was unfolding the following year, but the players pulled together and Richmond sneaked into the finals in fourth place. They then won all three finals to complete a remarkable turnaround, win the flag comfortably and leave everyone wondering what they <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> had they maintained concentration and made the 1968 finals. Hart had been the star player, winning his first best and fairest award, and he was made All-Australian after the 1969 Adelaide Carnival. This was a remarkable effort as he was based in Adelaide with the Royal Australian Artillery as part of his National Service. During the year, he actually trained with South Australian league club Glenelg and flew to Melbourne for matches. When Glenelg made the SA Grand Final, they asked Hart to play in the match. This move wasn't well received, particularly when it became known that Hart would get $2000 for 100 minutes of football. The opposition Sturt players took {{matters into their own hands}} and Hart was knocked out early in the game. He had little impact as Glenelg slipped to a loss.|$|E
