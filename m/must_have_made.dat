5|$|This {{is a list}} of {{the most}} noted former players at Bristol Rovers Football Club, stating the period that each player spent at the club, their {{nationality}} and their reason for being listed. To be included in this list a player <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> over 400 league appearances for the club, scored over 100 league goals or hold a club record.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the names}} of the authors, such as Irumpitarthalaiyaar and Kookaikozhiyaar, seem to be nicknames based on words from the poems rather than proper names. This {{suggests}} that those who compiled this anthology <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> up these names as the authors' names must have been lost when these poems were collected.|$|E
25|$|For {{first-round draft}} picks, {{restricted}} free agency is only allowed after a team exercises its option {{for a fourth}} year, and the team makes a Qualifying Offer at the Rookie-scale amount after the fourth year is completed. For any other player to be a restricted free agent, he must be at most a three-year NBA veteran, and his team <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> a Qualifying Offer for either 125% of his previous season's salary or the minimum salary plus $200,000, whichever offer is higher.|$|E

50|$|Black <b>has</b> <b>made</b> 6 captures; {{to account}} for his pawn formation, all 6 captures <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been <b>made</b> with pawns; the {{capturing}} pawns <b>must</b> <b>have</b> started on b7, c7, d7 and e7. White <b>has</b> <b>made</b> 4 captures; again all of these captures <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been <b>made</b> with pawns. 3 of these captures <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been <b>made</b> with the pawn on e6, which started on b2. Which of the pawns on f5 and f7 started on g2? Only one of these pawns made a capture; Black's original f-pawn <b>has</b> not <b>made</b> a capture and {{is still on the}} f-file, so the pawn on f7 cannot be the original f-pawn; it <b>must</b> <b>have</b> started on g2, and the pawn on f5 <b>must</b> <b>have</b> started on f2. The capture <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been <b>made</b> on f7, after Black played f7-f6 but before Black moved the g-pawn. The sequence was as follows: White's pawns advanced to f5 and g6; Black made a capture exf4; at some point Black played f7-f6; White made a capture gxf7; Black played g7-g5 (or g7-g6 and g6-g5).|$|R

25|$|To be {{eligible}} for nomination, a person {{must have been a}} native born or naturalized (since 1914) citizen of the United States, must have been dead for 25 years (since 1922; from 1900 through 1920, a nominee had to be dead only 10 years) and <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> a major contribution to the economic, political, or cultural life of the nation. Nominees were elected by a simple majority vote, except from 1925 through 1940, when a 3/5 majority was required. In 1976 a point system replaced the majority vote. Two nominees, Constance Woolson (nominated in 1900) and Orville Wright (elected in 1965), were considered, although being dead only 6 and 17 years respectively.|$|E
25|$|In Ong Kian Cheong, District Judge Neighbour {{stated that}} while {{people may have}} a desire to profess and spread their faith, the right to {{propagate}} such opinions cannot be unfettered. He found that both the accused persons, by distributing the seditious and objectionable tracts to Muslims and the general public, clearly reflected their intolerance, insensitivity and ignorance of delicate issues concerning race and religion in Singapore's multiracial and multi-religious society. Furthermore, in distributing the seditious and offensive tracts to spread their faith, the accused persons used the postal service to achieve their purpose and so were shielded by anonymity until {{the time they were}} apprehended. There is no doubt that this <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> it difficult for the police to trace them. In view of these circumstances, his Honour found that custodial sentences were warranted for both accused persons.|$|E
25|$|At 16:00, the CVR {{showed that}} Captain Tsu left the cockpit; five seconds later, the CVR stopped recording. Tests {{indicated}} that a click would be heard on the CVR recording if the CVR circuit breaker had tripped normally, but not {{if it had been}} pulled out manually. As there was no click, it is likely that Captain Tsu pulled out the CVR circuit breaker before leaving the cockpit. The NTSC and NTSB investigators thought that if Captain Tsu was responsible for the crash, he <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> up some excuse to get the First Officer to leave the flightdeck prior to disabling the FDR (which would have immediately triggered a Master Caution on both pilots' control panels), so his actions would not be noticed. Several minutes later, as recorded by Indonesian ground radar, the aircraft entered a rapid descent, disintegrated, and crashed into the Musi River.|$|E

25|$|It {{was late}} winter and snow still {{fell in the}} region. Without even enough {{blankets}} to keep their sick and wounded warm, the bedraggled Confederates who returned to Santa Fe <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> a pitiable sight. Louisa went to visit their wounded and was so moved by their suffering that she revealed hidden stores of blankets and turned her home into a field hospital; she personally led a hastily organized company of nurses {{to care for the}} sick and dying men and made trips to outlying encampments to bring her patients into Santa Fe or, failing that, to treat in situ those soldiers who could not be brought into the city. It was not until April 1 or 2 that General Sibley, who had been at Albuquerque most of this time, arrived at Santa Fe and personally met with Louisa. It is not known what transpired between them, but it can be presumed that he thanked her for caring for his men and reminisced about their earlier encounters when he and her husband had been on the same side.|$|E
500|$|Miles did not {{normally}} introduce his literary friends to each other, but {{before his death}} he had been forced by circumstance to introduce Manning to the poet Stevie Smith. The two developed an immediate rapport and enjoyed exploring London's backstreets, with regular outings to museums, cinema, and visits to the Palmers Green home that Smith shared with an eccentric aunt. According to a mutual friend, Manning found in Smith's home [...] "an atmosphere of security and comfort which <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> her room in Oakley Street seem even chillier and more threadbare." [...] The novelist and critic Walter Allen met Manning in 1937 and observed {{that she had a}} [...] "devastating" [...] wit [...] "and was as formidable a young woman as any in London". Manning and Smith, he added, were a malicious pair of snobs.|$|E
500|$|For {{a person}} to be {{inducted}} to the Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor, they <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> [...] "significant contributions to the game of basketball". Of the inaugural Hall of Fame class of 1959, seven individuals were inducted as contributors, including James Naismith, the inventor of basketball. All former NBA commissioners (Maurice Podoloff, Walter Kennedy, Larry O'Brien, and David Stern) have been inducted. Twelve individuals inducted as contributors have won the John Bunn Award, awarded by the Hall annually to a significant contributor: John Bunn (its inaugural recipient), Walter Kennedy, Clifford Fagan, Edward Gottlieb, Daniel Biasone, Larry O'Brien, Dave Gavitt, C. M. Newton, Tex Winter, Meadowlark Lemon, Tom [...] "Satch" [...] Sanders, and George Raveling. Two inductees in this category are women: Senda Berenson Abbott and Bertha Teague (both inducted in 1985). The most recent contributor to be inducted is Jerry Reinsdorf, who entered the Hall in 2016.|$|E

500|$|A live match {{audience}} witnessed Arsenal trounce Nottingham Forest at the City Ground {{in early}} November. Steve Bould, Brian Marwood Adams, Smith each scored {{as the team}} {{came back from a}} goal behind to win. [...] "It was a performance of true quality which <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> excellent viewing," [...] was Graham's verdict and he described it as [...] "satisfying" [...] to beat Forest at their home ground. Arsenal were not at their fluent best against Newcastle United though came away from St James' Park with a cleansheet and a 1–0 win – Bould scored for the second successive match. Paul Merson scored twice against Middlesbrough as Arsenal recorded a 3–0 win and moved into second place, just two points behind Norwich City. Arsenal's five England internationals, who featured against Saudi Arabia a week before, were lauded in The Times for their performances, despite playing tamely for country. The match reporter suggested the club versus country dilemma could be solved by including more Arsenal players, something Graham was sceptical about when put to him. [...] "I want England to do very well. It's just I want Arsenal to do better," [...] he said. Arsenal's unbeaten run came to an end against Derby County, where at the Baseball Ground a debatable penalty was awarded to the home side which allowed them {{to get back into the}} game.|$|E
500|$|Recorded in late June in Burbank, California, the special, called simply Elvis, {{aired on}} December 3, 1968. Later {{known as the}} '68 Comeback Special, the show {{featured}} lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band {{in front of a}} small audience—Presley's first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley clad in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock-and-roll days. Bill Belew, who designed this outfit, gave it a Napoleonic standing collar (Presley customarily wore high collars because he believed his neck looked too long), a design feature that he would later make a major trademark of the outfits Presley wore on stage in his later years. Director and coproducer Steve Binder had worked hard to reassure the nervous singer and to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned. The show, NBC's highest rated that season, captured 42 percent of the total viewing audience. Jon Landau of Eye magazine remarked, [...] "There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> Jim Morrison green with envy." [...] Dave Marsh calls the performance one of [...] "emotional grandeur and historical resonance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Literary historians argued {{later that}} Turgenev's {{overnight}} success {{might have seemed}} totally undeserved for Goncharov, who, for quite a while, {{felt like he was}} the only master of his field. Goncharov produced one [...] novel in a decade, but his new rival did it in a seemingly fleeting manner, which <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> the injustice look even more gross.|$|E

2500|$|Negative {{reception}} of the game character included accusations of sexual objectification and a controversy about underage characters. According to Official Xbox Magazine, [...] "the nubile DOA girls have always been slightly controversial, with high-minded types lamenting the gratuitous use of bouncing bosoms. But on Xbox, these criticisms seem to have died away - the sheer brilliance of DOA3s gameplay <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> all gamers, feminists included, realise that Tina, Kasumi et al are actually rather fit." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the {{relation}} between the two figures, Gadamer wrote: [...] "When asked about phenomenology, Husserl was quite right to answer as he used to in the period directly after World War I: 'Phenomenology, that is me and Heidegger'." [...] Nevertheless, Gadamer noted that Heidegger was no patient collaborator with Husserl, and that Heidegger's [...] "rash ascent to the top, the incomparable fascination he aroused, and his stormy temperament surely <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> Husserl, the patient one, as suspicious of Heidegger as he always had been of Max Scheler's volcanic fire." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Traveller {{was first}} {{published}} on 19 December 1764 by John Newbery, though the year was given on the imprint as 1765. [...] It {{was the first of}} Goldsmith's books to feature his name on the title-page. [...] Goldsmith received only £21 for The Traveller, but the publisher <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> a good deal more, since a second edition appeared in March 1765, a fourth in August 1765 (only eight months after the first), and a ninth before Goldsmith's death in 1774. [...] The author continued to revise the poem {{for the rest of his}} life, so that the ninth edition contained 36 new lines not in the first.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{unlikely}} that any gnōmōn could be read accurately on the pitching deck of a small vessel at night. Pytheas <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> frequent overnight stops to use his gnōmōn {{and talk to the}} natives, which would have required interpreters, probably acquired along the way. The few fragments that have survived indicate that this material was {{a significant part of the}} periplus, possibly kept as the ship's log. There is little hint of native hostility; the Celts and the Germans appear to have helped him, which suggests that the expedition was put forward as purely scientific. In any case all voyages required stops for food, water and repairs; the treatment of voyagers fell under the special [...] "guest" [...] ethic for visitors.|$|E
2500|$|By August 11, 80% of the French film {{industry}} had enlisted {{or had been}} drafted. [...] Cohl (at 57 years of age) {{was too old to}} fight, but he volunteered as best he could while working at Éclair. His heart was no longer in his work, for his beloved wife Suzanne was slowly dying. [...] In 1916, American cartoons took France by storm. Gaumont imported The Animated Grouch Chasers {{and for the first time}} since the early films of Blackton, animated films were being advertised with the name and face of their animator, Raoul Barré. If Barré is the individual who [...] "stole" [...] Cohl's techniques, this <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> him furious (it didn't help that it was his former employer that was doing all the hoopla).|$|E
2500|$|Only one Hurricane was built, {{registered}} G-EBHS. Since the Lympne {{trials were}} in October, the Hurricane <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> its first {{light in the}} late summer of 1923, probably piloted by Paul Bulman. At the trials, with Bulman at the controls it flew rather tail down, suggesting trim and wing incidence issues had not been sorted. [...] Compared with some other competitors it was overweight; like many others it suffered from an unreliable engine. Worst, it was slow; it had been entered specifically for the Abdullah speed prize and there had been talk of speeds near 100mph, but the best it could do was 58.5mph (94km/h) before retiring with a broken rocker arm. The winner of this £500 prize was the Parnall Pixie II at 76.1mph.|$|E
