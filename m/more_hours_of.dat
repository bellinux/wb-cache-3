5|$|Despite {{his power}} advantage, Woods has always focused on {{developing}} an excellent all-around game. Although {{in recent years}} he has typically been {{near the bottom of}} the Tour rankings in driving accuracy, his iron play is generally accurate, his recovery and bunker play is very strong, and his putting (especially under pressure) is possibly his greatest asset. He is largely responsible for a shift to higher standards of athleticism amongst professional golfers, and is known for utilizing <b>more</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> practice than most.|$|E

5|$|The new 1981-2010 (as {{opposed to}} 1971-2000) averages from the Met Office {{show how the}} climate of Leeming has changed {{dramatically}} compared with most places in the UK. The average April maximum temperature is only 12.3°C, compared with 14.1°C previously. The average yearly temperature has decreased to 9.45°C compared to 9.55°C previously and in contrast most places of the UK have become warmer. The days have become cooler and the nights warmer. Winters have become much milder, summers cooler. Leeming now gets an additional 44.7mm of rain per year, although also 62.3 <b>more</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> sunshine. The climate of Leeming has generally lost its characteristics of being drier and with more seasonal variation, compared {{with the rest of}} the UK. Leeming recorded its warmest December temperature on record in 2015.|$|E

25|$|A {{survey of}} 1.1 million {{residents}} in the United States found that those that reported sleeping about 7 hours per night had the lowest rates of mortality, whereas those that slept for fewer than 6 hours or more than 8 hours had higher mortality rates. Getting 8.5 or <b>more</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> sleep per night {{was associated with a}} 15% higher mortality rate. Severe insomnia– sleeping less than 3.5 hours in women and 4.5 hours in men– is associated with a 15% increase in mortality.|$|E
25|$|After the war, new {{problems}} arose {{especially for the}} citizens of the island of Basilan. The people there found it difficult to appear in courts, pay their taxes, seek help from the mayor and other officials. Going from Basilan to the mainland required three or <b>more</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> travel. To fix the problem, Representative Juan Alano filed a bill in Congress to separate Basilan from Zamboanga City. So the island of Basilan was proclaimed a separate city through Republic Act No. 288 on July 16, 1948.|$|E

25|$|Fluorescent lamps {{can be used}} to give {{artificial}} daylight. Different snails {{respond to}} day length in different ways. The ratio of light to darkness influences activity, feeding, and mating and egg-laying. Eighteen or <b>more</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> light apparently stimulate H. aspersa growth, while less than 12 hours inhibit it. Some snail species may associates the long hours of light with the start of summer—the peak growing season. Eighteen hours of daylight also appear optimal for breeding (mating and egg laying), but snails will breed in darkness.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{position}} {{southeast of the}} Alps, Graz is shielded from the prevailing westerly winds that bring weather fronts in from the North Atlantic to northwestern and central Europe. The weather in Graz is thus influenced by the Mediterranean, and it has <b>more</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> sunshine per year than Vienna or Salzburg and also less wind or rain. Graz lies in a basin that is only open to the south, causing the climate to be warmer than would be expected at that latitude. Plants are found in Graz that normally grow much further south.|$|E
25|$|Common bonsai species (particularly {{those from}} the Japanese tradition) are {{temperate}} climate trees from hardiness zones 7 to 9, and require moderate temperatures, moderate humidity, and full sun in summer with a dormancy period in winter that may need be near freezing. They do not thrive indoors, where the light is generally too dim, and humidity often too low, for them to grow properly. Only during their dormant period can they safely be brought indoors, and even then the plants require cold temperatures, reduced watering, and lighting that approximates {{the number of hours}} the sun is visible. Raising the temperature or providing <b>more</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> light than available from natural daylight can cause the bonsai to break dormancy, which often weakens or kills it.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{the minimum}} {{standards}} for paramedic training is considered vocational, but most 2 year colleges offer a paramedic associate degree option. Paramedic education programs typically follow the U.S. NHTSA EMS Curriculum. While many regionally accredited community colleges offer paramedic programs and 2 year associate degrees, {{a handful of}} universities also offer a 4-year bachelor's degree component. The national standard course minimum requires didactic and clinical hours for a paramedic program of 1,300 or <b>more</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> training to be accrediated and nationally recognized. Calendar length typically vary from 12 months to upwards of two years, excluding degree options, EMT training, work experience, and prerequisites. It is required to be a certified Emergency Medical Technician prior to starting paramedic training. Entry requirements vary from program to program, but many paramedic programs also have prerequisites such as one year required work experience on an ambulance, or anatomy and physiology courses from an accredited college or university.|$|E
25|$|In May 1759 Hawke was {{restored}} to the command of the Western Squadron. Meanwhile the Duc de Choiseul was planning a French invasion of Britain. A French army was assembled in Brittany, with plans to combine the separate French fleets so they could seize control of the English Channel and allow the invasion force to cross and capture London. When Hawke's force was driven off station by a storm, the French fleet under Hubert de Brienne, Comte de Conflans, took advantage and left port. On 20 November 1759 Hawke followed the French warships and, during a gale, he won a sufficient victory in the Battle of Quiberon Bay, that when combined with Admiral Edward Boscawen's victory at the Battle of Lagos, the French invasion threat was removed. Although he had effectively put the French channel fleet out of action {{for the remainder of}} the war, Hawke was disappointed he had not secured a more comprehensive victory asserting that had he had two <b>more</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> daylight the whole enemy fleet would have been taken.|$|E

A typical day for the crew began with a wake-up at 08:00, followed by two hours of personal hygiene and breakfast.

Three <b>more</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> work and another hour of exercise followed lunch, and the crews began preparing for their evening meal at about 19:00.

500|$|Critics {{noted the}} game's length as shorter than expected, with about ten hours of content. Clayman (IGN) had little desire to replay the solved puzzles and Bramwell (Eurogamer) was even {{eager for the}} game to end. Halverson (Play) planned {{to return to the}} game but wrote that he would have {{preferred}} five <b>more</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> the single-player over the Xbox Live features. Reviewers were largely unimpressed with the extra Xbox Live cooperative play and score attack features. Halverson (Play) had hopes for Kameo and Psychonauts to rekindle developer interest in the 3D platforming genre, but concluded that such games were likely not to return. Clayman (IGN) did not find the game {{to live up to its}} publicity as a competitor against The Legend of Zelda series, though Theobald (GameSpy) thought Kameo boss battles were comparable. Pfister (1UP.com) noted several traditional Rare flourishes—lots of color and graphics effects, puns for character names—but ultimately wrote that Kameo was proof that Microsoft had received [...] "exactly what they paid for" [...] in its acquisition of Rare. Theobald (GameSpy) said that Rare had avoided its usual tropes of making players collect lots of items and poor character design, and made a [...] "worthy" [...] launch title. Nigel Kendall (The Times) wrote that the game was [...] "more cerebral" [...] than the console's other games, which were stereotypically about driving, football, or shooting. Kasavin (GameSpot) noted that Kameo was the most accessible launch title to players of all ages. In summary, he thought the game was a suitable fit for players' first experiences on the new Xbox 360.|$|E
