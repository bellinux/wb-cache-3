5|$|Although Elizabeth Johnson {{was mistaken}} about the Pike village site, her <b>mistake</b> <b>is</b> {{held to be}} a {{fortunate}} one. The Webster County site had been subjected to decades of cultivation and relic hunting. The Republic County site was not entirely pristine, due to surface collecting and possibly to amateur excavation; but it was far better preserved. Today, the Kansas Historical Society operates a museum on the site, built in 1967 {{over one of the}} excavated earth lodges.|$|E
5|$|Debates are {{punctuated with}} {{vigorous}} gestures which enliven the ambience of the occasion. Each gesture has a meaning. The debater presents his case with subtlety, robed {{in a formal}} monk’s attire. Some of the gestures (said to have symbolic value), made during the debates, generally subtle dramatic gestures are: clapping after each question; holding right hand and stretching left hand forward and striking the left palm with the right palm; clapping hands loudly to stress the power and decisiveness of the defender’s arguments denoting his self-assurance; in case of wrong answer presented by the defender, the opponent gestures three circles with his hand around the defenders head followed by loud screaming to unnerve the defender; opponent's <b>mistake</b> <b>is</b> demonstrated by wrapping his upper robe around his waist; loud clapping and intense verbal exchange is common; and the approach is to trap the defender into a wrong line of argument. Each time a new question is asked, the teacher strikes his outstretched left palm with his right palm. When a question is answered correctly, it is acknowledged by the teacher bringing {{the back of his}} right hand to his left palm. When the defender wins the debate he makes an allegorical dig at the questioner by questioning his basic wisdom as a Buddhist.|$|E
5|$|Play {{starts with}} a batter {{standing}} at home plate, holding a bat. The batter waits for the pitcher to throw a pitch (the ball) toward home plate, and attempts {{to hit the ball}} with the bat. The catcher catches pitches that the batter does not hit—as a result of either electing not to swing or failing to connect—and returns them to the pitcher. A batter who hits the ball into the field of play must drop the bat and begin running toward first base, at which point the player is referred to as a runner (or, until the play is over, a batter-runner). A batter-runner who reaches first base without being put out (see below) is said to be safe and is now on base. A batter-runner may choose to remain at first base or attempt to advance to second base or even beyond—however far the player believes can be reached safely. A player who reaches base despite proper play by the fielders has recorded a hit. A player who reaches first base safely on a hit is credited with a single. If a player makes it to second base safely {{as a direct result of}} a hit, it is a double; third base, a triple. If the ball is hit in the air within the foul lines over the entire outfield (and outfield fence, if there is one), or otherwise safely circles all the bases, it is a home run: the batter and any runners on base may all freely circle the bases, each scoring a run. This is the most desirable result for the batter. A player who reaches base due to a fielding <b>mistake</b> <b>is</b> not credited with a hit—instead, the responsible fielder is charged with an error.|$|E

25|$|Peaches are {{considered}} self-fertile because a commercial crop {{can be produced}} without cross-pollination, though cross-pollination usually gives a better crop. Apples {{are considered}} self-incompatible, because a commercial crop must be cross-pollinated. Many commercial fruit tree varieties are grafted clones, genetically identical. An orchard block of apples of one variety is genetically a single plant. Many growers now consider this a mistake. One means of correcting this <b>mistake</b> <b>is</b> to graft a limb of an appropriate pollenizer (generally a variety of crabapple) every six trees or so.|$|E
25|$|Bishōjo ("beautiful girl") {{is often}} mistakenly {{considered}} a parallel of bishōnen, {{because of the}} similar construction of the terms. There are major {{differences between the two}} aesthetics. The bishōjo aesthetic is aimed at a male audience, and is typically centered on young girls, drawn in a cute, pretty style; and bishōnen is aimed at a female audience, centered on teenage boys, and drawn elegantly. Another common <b>mistake</b> <b>is</b> assuming that the female characters in bishōnen manga and anime are bishōjo. In truth, female characters in bishōnen manga are very different from those in bishōjo; bishōjo females are usually more petite and drawn in a style that is cute rather than beautiful, whereas bishōnen females exhibit the long limbs and elegance of the bishōnen.|$|E
25|$|Sir Eglamour kills {{a dragon}} as his third {{trial for the}} hand of Christabel, the earl's daughter. Dragons feature in many medieval stories, both in the Arthurian world and in medieval romance generally. The Middle English Breton lai Sir Degaré, for example, tells a broadly similar story to that of Sir Eglamour of Artois. A baby boy is {{separated}} from his mother, brought up by another family knowing nothing of his true origins and on reaching adulthood, takes part in a tournament at which he wins the hand of his own mother in marriage. In both cases, the <b>mistake</b> <b>is</b> soon realized by the recognition of an object; gloves {{in the case of}} Sir Degaré, a heraldic device on a shield in the case of Sir Eglamour of Artois's lost son. In both stories, a dragon is killed: Sir Degaré kills his before his journey to the tournament.|$|E

Architecture that <b>is</b> full of <b>mistakes.</b> San Rocco 3 does not talk about that. San Rocco 3 is interested in another kind of mistake: <b>mistakes</b> that <b>are</b> {{the product of a}} disproportion, of a displacement; <b>mistakes</b> that <b>are</b> somehow generous, open, brave; mistakes that involve some sort of heroic failure; mistakes that shed a new light on the limits of the very same rule that labels them as <b>mistakes.</b> <b>Mistakes</b> <b>are</b> evident, public. Like rules, they involve some sort of agreement. <b>Mistakes</b> <b>are</b> the opposite of opinions. Actually, mistakes despise opinions even more than rules do. Mistakes can happen only if there is a shared knowledge. Mistakes do not imply a complete refusal of the rule; rather, a rule is opposed by a new and different rule, not by a mistake. Mistakes do not want {{to do away with the}} rule; instead, mistakes try to establish a relationship with the rule (even if this is not a very relaxed one). <b>Mistakes</b> <b>are</b> episodes in which the rule manifests itself in all its weakness and clumsiness. <b>Mistakes</b> <b>are</b> a comedy about rules, or the stumbling and stuttering little brothers of rules. There is something intimately didactic about mistakes. As soon as there <b>is</b> a <b>mistake,</b> there <b>is</b> some sort of correction, some sort of teaching, some sort of school. <b>Mistakes</b> <b>are</b> necessarily plural: if there is a rule, there will <b>be</b> plenty of <b>mistakes.</b> Mistakes suggest the possibility (and the necessity) of a new kind of rule, one that could even cope with this specific kind of mistake. Mistakes somehow point toward some forgotten potential. <b>Mistakes</b> <b>are</b> progressive...|$|R

25|$|A scrum may {{be formed}} if a team commits a minor {{infringement}} or play {{needs to be}} restarted.It consists of the eight forwards from both teams binding together in three rows with the two front rows bound and pushing against each other. The two props (loosehead and tighthead) {{either side of the}} hooker form the front row. The second row consists of two locks and the two flankers, while the number 8 is the third row (back row). If an infringement occurs the team that did not make the <b>mistake</b> <b>is</b> awarded the scrum. Infringements that result in a scrum are: knocking or passing the ball forward, a player being accidentally offside, a player being in front of the kicker during a kick-off or drop-out, delay (one minute) in taking a kick from a mark or taking a shot at goal from a penalty, or if a player incorrectly taps the ball at a penalty or free kick.|$|E

The <b>mistake</b> <b>is</b> often made that this Abbey of Sion was a Priory of Sion, but {{there is a difference between}} an abbey and a priory.

The team initially planned to include an online multiplayer component, which would have allowed 64 planes to fly in the same area—thereby giving players the ability to compete with one another.

The staff members also sought to include aerobatic competitions in which the player could participate, but the idea was dropped because of difficulties with realism.
