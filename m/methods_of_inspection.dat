This is the share of two major metallurgic companies - Arcelor Mittal Temirtau JSC and Kazakhmys Corporation. In the period from 2008 to 2012 Arcelor Mittal Temirtau has paid the penalty of more than one billion tenge for noncompliance of emission standards, Kazakhmys Corporation - more than 300 million tenge.According to the results of 2012 the expected decline in total emissions in Karaganda equals to 31% compared to 2008. This is mainly the merit of environmental protection program of a single enterprise - [...] "BalkhashTsvetMet", a subsidiary of Kazakhmys Corporation. In 2008 [...] "BalkhashTsvetMet" [...] has commissioned production on the basis of sulfuric acid.

With reference to the last-cited rule, during 1898 a Prussian mining commission visited Great Britain, France and Belgium, to study and compare the various <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> by working miners established in these three countries.

Numeri-cal experiments show that for planar flaws aligned with the inspection surface the performance of thermal line scanning is broadly equivalent to that of con-ventional flash thermography.
