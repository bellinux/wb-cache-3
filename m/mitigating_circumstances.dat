5|$|On June 29 the FIA World Motorsport Council {{found the}} teams guilty {{on the first}} two counts, that is, of not being in {{possession}} of suitable tyres for the event, but with strong <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstances,</b> and that of wrongfully refusing to allow their cars to start the race. The teams were found not guilty of the other three counts. The punishment, however, was not decided, and was not to have been announced until September 14.|$|E

He was brought to court-martial on 12 June 1798 aboard , and the offence being proved, the court {{had no choice but}} to dismiss him from the service. In view of the <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstances,</b> the court recommended that Paulet be considered for clemency by King George III. The King was pleased to follow the recommendation and reinstated Paulet in the service.|$|E
5|$|There are {{specific}} instances where properties {{usually do not}} merit listing in the National Register. As a general rule, cemeteries, birthplaces, graves of historical figures, properties owned by religious institutions or used for religious purposes, moved structures, reconstructed historic buildings, commemorative properties, and properties that have achieved significance during {{the last fifty years}} are not qualified for listing on the Register. There are, however, exceptions to all the preceding; <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstances</b> allow properties classified in one of those groups to be included.|$|E
50|$|Medina {{was convicted}} of first-degree murder and auto theft. The jury, by a ten-to-two vote, {{recommended}} {{the death penalty for}} the murder conviction. The trial court found two aggravating circumstances  and a single <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstance.</b> The court found the aggravating <b>circumstances</b> outweighed the <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstance</b> and sentenced Medina to death. This Court affirmed Medina's convictions and sentences. (Medina v. State, 466 So.2d 1046 (Fla. 1985)).|$|R

5|$|On December 5, 1989, Judge Roth found Taylor {{guilty of}} the first-degree child rape and first-degree murder of Charla Nicole King. During the penalty phase of Taylor's trial, his {{half-sister}} Leslie Beale traveled from Florida to testify about his harsh treatment under his stepfather and the three years that Taylor spent in a sex offender program at a Florida mental institution. On December 19, Taylor became the first convict in 40 years {{to be sent to}} death row by a Weber County court. Roth said that {{the facts of the case}} outweighed any <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstances.</b> Taylor's father Albert attended most of his son's court proceedings until he died of heart failure on October 8, 1990. Taylor said he was not permitted to attend his father's funeral.|$|E

25|$|No trial lasted {{more than}} a day, and the longest jury {{deliberation}} lasted less than two hours. The shortest {{was little more than}} half an hour. Although the defense attorneys pointed out <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstances,</b> the juries quickly convicted each defendant and sentenced them to execution in the electric chair. The judge presiding was Kennon C. Whittle.|$|E

25|$|Before Teresa's death, Syriani {{was charged}} with {{assault with a deadly}} weapon with intent to kill. This charge was changed to capital murder after her death. On June 12, 1991 he was sentenced to death in Mecklenburg County Superior Court, with the jury finding as an {{aggravating}} factor the crime being especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel. This outweighed the eight <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstances</b> they also found.|$|E
25|$|In December 2012, she {{was convicted}} of drug {{smuggling}} at Denpasar District Court {{and sentenced to death}} by firing squad in January 2013. By contrast, the others involved in the case were convicted of lesser drugs-related offences and received custodial sentences. Prosecutors had recommended Sandiford should also receive a custodial sentence because of her willingness to cooperate with police, but the panel of judges overseeing the hearing felt her actions had undermined Indonesia's anti-drugs policy and concluded there were no <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstances</b> in her favour.|$|E
50|$|Gonzalez {{was charged}} with first degree {{intentional}} homicide and attempted first degree intentional homicide {{as a result of}} the shooting. Under Wisconsin law, self-defense is a <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstance</b> to these charges, and once claimed the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstance</b> does not exist. Actual self-defense is an absolute defense to the charges. Unnecessary self-defense (the accused believed self-defense was needed, but such belief was unreasonable) reduces the charges. If the prosecution cannot prove the accused did not have a valid self-defense motive (even an unreasonable one), the charges are automatically reduced. Under most of the reduced charges, unreasonable self-defense is no longer an affirmative defense. Actual (reasonable) self-defense is a valid defense for the reduced charges.|$|R
50|$|Vollrausch {{is a legal}} {{principle}} that complements Actio libera in causa in German law.

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Hurricane Hazel, the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority was created though the merger of smaller, regional conservation authorities, with the mission to manage the area's floodplains and rivers. For instance, there had been previously rejected plans to build dams along the Humber River to control flooding; after the storm, some were built, but they would not prevent flooding in another weather event with Hazel's intensity and the same <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstances.</b> Other than making changes in the Greater Toronto Area, flood control in Ontario and Canada as a whole became a more important issue.|$|E
25|$|Baddour {{subsequently}} sentenced Lovette to life {{in prison}} without the possibility of parole. Neither Lovette nor Carson's parents spoke before the sentence was handed down. On February 5, 2013, the North Carolina Court of Appeals vacated Lovette's life sentence and ordered a new sentencing hearing. The decision relied on Miller v. Alabama, where the Supreme Court ruled that a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole for defendants under 18 at the time of a crime is cruel and unusual punishment. On June 3, a re-sentencing hearing was held. After Baddour considered <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstances,</b> Lovette was again sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.|$|E
25|$|Warren McCleskey {{was convicted}} of two counts of armed robbery and one count {{of murder in the}} Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia. McCleskey was African American; his victim was white Atlanta Police Officer Frank Schlatt. At the {{sentencing}} hearing, the jury found two aggravating circumstances existed beyond a reasonable doubt: the murder was committed during the course of an armed robbery, and the murder was committed upon a police officer engaged in the performance of his duties. A finding of either aggravating circumstance was sufficient to impose the death penalty. Petitioner did not provide any <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstances,</b> and the jury recommended the death penalty. The court followed the jury's recommendation and sentenced petitioner to death.|$|E

50|$|Aggravated assault, for example, {{is usually}} {{differentiated}} from simple assault by the offender's intent (e.g., to murder or to rape), {{the extent of}} injury to the victim, {{or the use of}} a deadly weapon. An aggravating circumstance is a kind of attendant circumstance and the opposite of an extenuating or <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstance,</b> which decreases guilt.|$|R

25|$|Advice in 1945 when Hitler asked Dönitz {{whether the}} Geneva Convention should be denounced. Hitler's motives were twofold. The first was that {{reprisals}} {{could be taken}} against Western Allied prisoners of war; second, it would deter German forces from surrendering to the Western Allies (as was happening on the Eastern Front where the Geneva Convention was in abeyance). Instead of arguing the conventions should never be denounced, Dönitz suggested it was not expedient to do so, so the court found against him on this issue; but as the Convention was not denounced by Germany, and British prisoners in camps under Dönitz's jurisdiction were treated strictly according to the Convention, the Court considered these <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstances.</b>|$|E
25|$|All four charged {{were convicted}} of fraud on 21 March 1998. In all major matters, the {{prosecutors}} submission of evidence {{was supported by the}} judge. The court felt that the fraud {{was the result of a}} planned work, and had been ongoing for several years. The court did not believe that the organisation did not have financial motives for the fraud. The court also stated that an organisation culture was not <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstances.</b> It also stated that the leaders and treasurers had a personal responsibility. The court also felt that not following a requirement from the city issued in 1992, requiring AUF to clean up its membership register system, was in the disfavour of the indicted.|$|E
25|$|Despite the prosecution's {{recommendation}} of leniency, at her sentencing hearing on 22 January 2013 {{a panel of}} judges ruled there were no <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstances</b> in Sandiford's favour, and imposed a death sentence. Amser Simanjuntak, who headed the panel said Sandiford's actions had damaged Bali's reputation as a tourist destination and undermined Indonesia's fight against drugs, while his colleague, Komang Wijaya Adi said their decision had been influenced by several factors, including what was viewed as her lack of remorse. The sentence was greeted with gasps from around the courtroom. In Indonesia an execution is generally carried out by firing squad, often at night in an isolated location. Following the judgment Sandiford was led from the court in a distressed state, where she declined to speak to journalists before being escorted away by guards {{to be held at}} Bali's notorious Kerobokan Prison. Her lawyers announced she would appeal, a process that can take several years under Indonesian law.|$|E
50|$|On July 27, 1998 Clark appealed this {{decision}} to the United States district court which was denied on December 13, 1999, again without allowing discovery or an evidentiary hearing.

The only <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstance</b> that could possibly have been urged in favour of the accused, namely that of 'first offence', had vanished.|$|R
40|$|When a {{defendant}} hailing from a minority background {{charged with a}} criminal offence states that his actions were reasonable {{in light of his}} culture, what implications does this have on the legal reasoning of the judges? When culture and cultural background is blamed for criminal acts, theorists use the expression the cultural defence. This thesis seeks to study the phenomenon and find an answer to the thesis question; what implications does culture have for legal reasoning when introduced as a <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstance</b> in criminal court cases? I have studied and discussed six criminal cases in this thesis; three cases from the United Kingdom and three from Norway. In all six cases, the courts have been faced with the cultural defence and asked to consider the cultural background of the defendant when making their decision. The cases have covered the offences of murder, attempted murder, rape and causing a minor to engage in sexual activities, and in each case the defence has introduced the cultural background of the defendant as a possible <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstance.</b> The thesis explores theories of multiculturalism with regards to the cases, as well as general theories on the cultural defence. Advocates of the cultural defence claim that it should be introduced as a valid, legal defence for criminal offences, which seems to be approved by multicultural theorists who argue that group-differentiated rights should be given to persons with minority backgrounds. This is contrasted by the critics of multicultural theories, who state that minorities should be held responsible for the disadvantages they face {{as a result of their}} own cultural ideals. Based on this theoretical backdrop the thesis explores the six cases one by one, aiming to find an answer to whether culture is reflected in legal reasoning or not. The most influential pieces of literature on the topic of the cultural defence cover the case law where culture has seemingly coloured the legal arguments and the outcome of the cases. The case law in this thesis has not been selected on the grounds of how successful the cultural defence has when introduced as a <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstance,</b> but rather on the basis of whether the cultural background of the defendant has been introduced as a possible defence at all. Based on the six cases from Norway and the United Kingdom, we will be able to get a general impression of the tendencies amongst the courts to accept culture as a <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstance,</b> and how this reflects in the legal reasoning of the judges...|$|R
25|$|The NTEU {{has been}} famous for {{aggressive}} {{use of the}} courts to supplement their statutorily-limited powers to bargain and restraints on traditional labor tactics such as strikes and boycotts. In 1972, the union sued President Richard M. Nixon, challenging his decision to bypass Congress and postpone salary increases for all federal workers covered by the General Schedule. This lawsuit, NTEU v. Nixon, resulted in an unprecedented victory that required the government to pay over $533 million in back pay to federal employees. In another lawsuit, Boyce and Dixon v. United States, the removal of two IRS service center employees was reversed, establishing {{for the first time}} the principles that an agency did not have total discretion in penalizing employees and that <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstances</b> could render an agency-ordered removal an abuse of discretion. Shortly thereafter, in NTEU v. Fasser, the union won the right for federal employees to engage in informational picketing, an action previously deemed banned by federal law. During the Reagan and first Bush administrations, NTEU participated aggressively in numerous court battles. It took the issue of the constitutionality of random drug testing of Customs inspectors all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court in NTEU v. Von Raab and it successfully fought initiatives it viewed as anti-worker proposed by the head of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).|$|E
500|$|At the trial, both WCRC and Cox pleaded guilty. WCRC were fined £200,000 plus {{costs of}} £64,000.

Cox was sentenced to four months imprisonment, {{suspended}} for eighteen months. He was also ordered to do 80 hours unpaid work. Cox's counsel stated in court that [...] "he would never drive trains again".|$|E

He served the jail sentence and paid the fine on the day it was announced. In deciding to reduce the sentence, High Court Judge L.P. Thean said that a [...] "nominal custodial sentence" [...] was sufficient given the <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstances</b> in Knight's case. In April, all charges against his wife in relation to his case were also dropped.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, in many {{countries}} in jurisprudence, the defence of infancy {{is a form of}} defence by which a defendant argues that, at the time a law was broken, they were not liable for their actions and thus should not be held liable for a crime. Many courts recognise that defendants who are considered to be juveniles may avoid criminal prosecution on account of their age and in borderline cases the age of the offender is often held to be a <b>mitigating</b> <b>circumstance.</b>|$|R
