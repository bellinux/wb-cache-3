5|$|Virginia Tech was led {{on offense}} by quarterback Jim Druckenmiller. During the 1996 season, he {{completed}} 142 of his 250 pass attempts for 2,071 yards, 17 touchdowns, and five interceptions, boosting his career total to 4,383 yards and 34 touchdowns. Because of these numbers, {{he was considered}} one of the top quarterback prospects in the upcoming NFL draft. Despite Druckenmiller's success, it was the Hokies' rushing game that received <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention.</b> The Hokies averaged 4.8 yards per rushing attempt and produced 2,504 yards rushing and 27 touchdowns during the regular season. Tech's 227.6-yards-per-game rushing average was No. 2 in the Big East Conference and No. 19 among 111 Division I-A schools.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that {{destruction}} of civilian and military targets by women through paramilitary activities included less than seventy women, or about 2% of the total females in the military arm of the FLN, it was these acts, especially during the Battle of Algiers (1957), which received <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> given to women in this conflict.|$|E
25|$|Cannibalism has two {{peaks in}} the life of a chicken; during the {{brooding}} period and at the onset of egg laying. The point-of-lay cannibalism is generally the most damaging and gets <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention.</b> The temporary beak trimming developed at the Ohio Experiment Station assumed that cannibalism was a phase, and that blunting the beak temporarily would be adequate.|$|E
30|$|Conducting {{polymers}} such as polyaniline (PAni) {{have drawn}} considerable interest for their wide applications. PAni is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> attractive conducting polymers {{due to its}} high conductivity and good stability. PAni as a conductive polymer has attracted <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attentions</b> due to its simple preparation and doping procedure, good environmental stability, relatively high conductivity, and low cost and also due to its wide spectrum of applications.|$|R

30|$|All the {{abovementioned}} tracers share {{a similar}} structure (benzyl/phenethyl guanidine) as MIBG and therefore represent comparable properties. Among them, 18 F-LMI 1195 {{has so far}} caught <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attentions</b> from researchers due to its easy and high-yield labeling procedure that is convenient and eligible for commercial preparation and application [8, 9]. Similar to MIBG, 18 F-LMI 1195 is resistant to metabolism by monoamine oxidase [5, 10]. In a head-to-head comparison of 18 F-LMI 1195 with 123 I-MIBG in isolated perfused rabbit hearts, tracer washout after vesicle turnover was accelerated by electrical field stimulation. Additionally, our group has also demonstrated that <b>the</b> retention <b>of</b> 18 F-LMI 1195 is resistant to desipramine chase (desipramine added after tracer delivery), which emphasizes its potential <b>of</b> mimicking <b>the</b> physiological norepinephrine turnover [11].|$|R
500|$|Nordby said <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> {{was devoted}} to Jennifer's face and that [...] "very quickly in combination" [...] with special effects and makeup, MPC thought up a five-station system for what Jennifer goes through. Nordby stated:Stage one is {{beautiful}} Jennifer and then two and three were strictly makeup where her eyes become more recessed and she would start to look plain {{like the rest of}} us. And stage four was some custom dentures that KNB made for her, and then visual effects in stage four was mainly facial warping and recessing her eyes some more and having a pinning effect to her irises {{and a variety of other}} musculature deforms, just bringing her cheek bones down more. And stage five was the full on, as crazy as it gets, which you don't really see until near the end.|$|E
500|$|Sinatra began singing professionally as a teenager, but {{he learned}} music by ear and {{never learned to}} read music. He got his first break in 1935 when his mother persuaded a local singing group, the 3 Flashes, to let him join. Fred Tamburro, the group's baritone, stated that [...] "Frank hung around us like we were gods or something", admitting that they only took him on board because he owned a car and could chauffeur the group around. Sinatra soon learned they were {{audition}}ing for the Major Bowes Amateur Hour show, and [...] "begged" [...] the group to let him in on the act. With Sinatra, the group {{became known as the}} Hoboken Four, and passed an audition from Edward Bowes to appear on the Major Bowes Amateur Hour show. They each earned $12.50 for the appearance, and ended up attracting 40,000 votes and won first prize—a six-month contract to perform on stage and radio across the United States. Sinatra quickly became the group's lead singer, and, much to the jealousy of his fellow group members, garnered <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> from girls. Due {{to the success of the}} group, Bowes kept asking for them to return, disguised under different names, varying from [...] "The Seacaucus Cockamamies" [...] to [...] "The Bayonne Bacalas".|$|E
2500|$|Eliza Haywood is now {{regarded}} as [...] "a {{case study in}} the politics of literary history" [...] (Backscheider 100). She is also being re-evaluated by feminist scholars and rated very highly. Interest in Haywood’s work has been growing since the 1980s. Her novels are {{regarded as}} stylistically innovative.

2500|$|During the Soviet war in Afghanistan in the 1980s, Paramilitary Operations Officers were {{instrumental}} in equipping Mujaheddin forces against the Soviet Army. Although the CIA in general, and a Texas congressman named Charlie Wilson in particular, have received <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention,</b> the key architect of this strategy was Michael G. Vickers. Vickers was a young Paramilitary Operations Officer from SAD/SOG.

2500|$|While {{the mobile}} game Before Crisis, the first Compilation game title to be released, has {{received}} limited western commentary, writers at AnimeFringe felt that [...] "the chance {{to reverse the}} good and bad guy roles should be welcomed by many." [...] Advent Children received mixed views from critics. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network felt that, due to the film's pace and context, viewers were not given {{enough time to get}} to know the characters. These sentiments were echoed by John Eriani of Mania Entertainment, who particularly faulted the lack of character names or explanations of the villains' motives. Chris Carle of IGN was critical of the lack of motivation for those who were not familiar with the series, but praised both the English and Japanese voice acting. Michael Beckett of RPGamer, while generally less than impressed by the overall story, said that it [...] " [...] some interesting insights into a few of the less-developed characters of the game, though Cloud receives <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> and development as the story unfolds".|$|E
2500|$|Shamrock {{was then}} matched up with UFC 5 tournament {{champion}} Dan Severn at UFC 6 on July 14, 1995 {{to determine the}} reigning champion of the UFC. The 'superfight', a match presented as a fight between the [...] "best of the best", was still the match that would determine the UFC champion and the tournament winners would be considered the #1 contender for the newly created UFC Superfight Championship (later replaced by the UFC Heavyweight Championship when weight categories {{were introduced to the}} UFC). Their feud began at the pre-fight press conference. After <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> from the media was given to Shamrock, Severn got up {{and walked out of the}} door without explanation. Shamrock took Severn's action as a sign of disrespect. Severn later said that he walked out because he felt that it would be unfair to Shamrock for him to be present in the room while Shamrock was discussing his fight strategy to the media. Shamrock became even more furious when he found a newsletter back at the hotel that explained to readers how Severn was going to destroy Shamrock. During the match, Shamrock forced Severn to tap out to a choke in 2:14 to win the UFC Superfight Championship.|$|E

Susan, 16, competed in the grandmaster section and had a victory against GM Walter Browne and Sophia, 11, finished second in her section, but Judit gathered <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> in the tournament. Grandmasters would drop by to watch the serious, quiet child playing. She won her first seven games before drawing the final game. Although the unrated section had many of the weaker players in the Open, it also had players of expert strength, who were foreign to the United States and had not been rated yet. Milorad Boskovic related a conversation with Judit's sixth-round opponent, a Yugoslav player he knew {{to be a strong}} expert: [...] "He told me he took some chances in the game because he couldn't believe she was going to attack so well." [...] Not able to speak English, her mother interpreted as she told a reporter her goal was to be a chess professional.
