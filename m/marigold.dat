40|$|African and Mexican <b>marigolds</b> (Tagetes species), common weeds of Africa, can {{substantially}} improve {{plant growth}} in soil infested with root knot nematodes. Trials in Tanzania have shown that, {{although not as}} effective as nematicides, Tagetes have potential for farmers in developing countries where chemicals are often beyond their means. At the Tropical Pesticide Research Institute in Arusha, Tanzania, {{the effectiveness of the}} <b>marigolds</b> was tested against two nematicides, Aldicarb and ethylene dibromide, with crops of tomatoes in highly-infested soils. <b>Marigolds</b> were planted beside the tomatoes. The two nematicides reduced the number of nematode root galls by 90 - 95 %, whereas the presence of <b>marigolds</b> reduced infestation by 85 %. The plants grown with Aldicarb not only grew better than the other treatments but yielded ten times as much fruit as the control. The tomatoes intercropped with <b>marigolds</b> gave six times the yield of fruit. For some reason, the ethylene dibromide treatment gave the poorest results in terms of plant growth and yield, although it was the most effective treatment for reducing root galling. The researchers feel that <b>marigolds</b> have good potential for overcoming nematode problems with vegetable crops. They can be intercropped easily, require no expertise, cause no toxicity hazards, and could provide a more stable and long-lasting control.

5|$|There are densely forested regions around Gangtok, {{consisting}} of temperate, deciduous forests of poplar, birch, oak, and elm, {{as well as}} evergreen, coniferous trees of the wet alpine zone. Orchids are common, and rare varieties of orchids are featured in flower shows in the city. Bamboos are also abundant. In the lower reaches of the town, the vegetation gradually changes from alpine to temperate deciduous and subtropical. Flowers such as sunflower, <b>marigold,</b> poinsettia, and others bloom, especially in November and December.|$|E

The basalt underpinnings of Trotternish produce a diversity of Arctic and alpine plants including alpine pearlwort and mossy cyphal. The low-lying fields of Waternish contain corn <b>marigold</b> and corn spurry. The sea cliffs of Duirinish boast mountain avens and fir clubmoss. Minginish produces fairy flax, cats-ear and black bog rush. There is {{a fine example of}} Brachypodium-rich ash woodland at Tokavaig in Sleat incorporating silver birch, hazel, bird cherry, and hawthorn.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species of}} {{parasitic}} wasp, {{especially in the}} Trichogrammatidae, are exploited commercially to provide biological control of insect pests. For example, in Brazil, farmers control sugarcane borers with the parasitic wasp Trichogramma galloi. One of the first species to be used was Encarsia formosa, a parasitoid {{of a range of}} species of whitefly. It entered commercial use in the 1920s in Europe, was overtaken by chemical pesticides in the 1940s, and again received interest from the 1970s. Encarsia is used especially in greenhouses to control whitefly pests of tomato and cucumber, {{and to a lesser extent}} of aubergine (eggplant), flowers such as <b>marigold,</b> and strawberry. Several species of parasitic wasp are natural predators of aphids and can help to control them. For instance, Aphidius matricariae is used to control the peach-potato aphid.|$|E

40|$|General EcologyIntercropping is a {{technique}} studied by agroecologists in which two or more species are planted together to improve agricultural systems. Since industrial agriculture {{has proven to be}} ecologically destructive, the reintroduction of intercropping in United States farming is part of the larger effort to create a sustainable and secure agricultural system. Intercropping improves the use of resources including water, soil, and labor. This paper focuses on intercropping as an alternative to pesticides and nitrogen fertilizers. In addition to reviewing other studies, we analyzed our own study in which we intercropped arugula with beans and <b>marigolds.</b> We hypothesized that arugula yield would be greatest when intercropped with beans and <b>marigolds</b> since beans increase nitrogen availability and <b>marigolds</b> deter herbivory. Though the results suggested that beans inhibit the growth of arugula in comparison to the control, all treatments with <b>marigolds</b> had significantly less herbivory...|$|R

To entertain the attendees that have arrived at Pooja's (Renuka Shahane) baby shower, her sister Nisha (Madhuri Dixit) and her husband's cousin Rita (Sahila Chadha) arrange a comic skit. While Nisha is presented as a pregnant lady with a pillow stuffed belly, Rita is seen in a young man's get-up which resembles to that of Prem (Salman Khan) who is Pooja's devar (younger brother-in-law). Throughout the song's lyrics, Nisha tells everyone of how Prem is deewana (crazy) and always tries to woo girls. The fake Prem, i.e. Rita, always tries to flirt and tease all the ladies, especially Nisha. He also hits Nisha's bum with a <b>marigold</b> flower, using a slingshot. Afterwards, the fake Prem is shown being beaten by all the present ladies. Then, the real Prem, who was secretly watching the comic skit, comes in and hits Nisha's bum again with a <b>marigold</b> flower. Following this, Prem jumps off the balcony and hangs onto the chandelier. Afraid of being caught red handed in imitating him, Nisha and Rita try to run away. Surprisingly, Prem begs pardon for his behaviour towards Nisha. The video ends with Prem faking a pregnant lady in lingerie. The clip has a large group of female dancers dancing in-sync in the background. Amongst the prominent star cast of the film, Bindu, Himani Shivpuri, Priya Arun, Laxmikant Berde, are also seen throughout the video.|$|E
5|$|During the 1880s, Evans printed two {{to three}} Greenaway books a year, {{including}} a run of 150,000 copies of Kate Greenaway's Birthday Book (1880), as well as Mother Goose (1881), The Language of Flowers (1884), <b>Marigold</b> Garden (1885), The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1887), and King Pepito (1889). From the mid-1880s to the mid-1890s Evans printed, and Greenaway illustrated, nine almanacs—one each year. Greenaway benefitted from her association with Evans. As the leading publisher of children's books, Routledge provided Greenaway with a commercial base she may not have achieved without Evans' influence. Children's literature scholar Anne Lundin claims the distinctive quality of Evans' printing, as wells as his popularity as a children's book printer, linked Greenaway's name with his, thereby increasing her commercial appeal. Greenaway often visited the Evans family, played with their three daughters and continued to visit Evans after his move to Ventnor. During her career as an illustrator, Greenaway used Evans as sole engraver and printer.|$|E
