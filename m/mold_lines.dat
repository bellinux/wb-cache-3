40|$|A video-based photogrammetric model {{deformation}} system was {{established as a}} dedicated optical measurement technique at supersonic speeds in the NASA Langley Research Center Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel. This system {{was used to measure}} the wing twist due to aerodynamic loads of two supersonic commercial transport airplane models with identical outer <b>mold</b> <b>lines</b> but different aeroelastic properties. One model featured wings with deflectable leading- and trailing-edge flaps and internal channels to accommodate static pressure tube instrumentation. The wings of the second model were of single-piece construction without flaps or internal channels. The testing was performed at Mach numbers from 1. 6 to 2. 7, unit Reynolds numbers of 1. 0 million to 5. 0 million, and angles of attack from - 4 degrees to + 10 degrees. The video {{model deformation}} system quantified the wing aeroelastic response to changes in the Mach number, Reynolds number concurrent with dynamic pressure, and angle of attack and effectively captured the differences in the wing twist characteristics between the two test articles...|$|E

The test objectives were to establish supersonic ascent aerodynamic databases and to obtain force and moment, surface pressure, and longitudinal line-load distributions for comparison to computational predictions. Test data were obtained at low through high supersonic Mach numbers for ranges of the Reynolds number, angle of attack, and roll angle. This paper focuses on (1) {{the sensitivity of the}} supersonic aerodynamic characteristics to selected protuberances, outer mold line changes, and wind tunnel boundary layer transition techniques, (2) comparisons of experimental data to computational predictions, and (3) data reproducibility. The experimental data obtained in the Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel captured the effects of evolutionary changes to the Ares I crew launch vehicle, exhibited good agreement with predictions, and displayed satisfactory within-test and tunnel-to-tunnel data reproducibility...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} proposes {{two methods}} {{to investigate the}} robustness differences between competing types of advanced space launch systems. These methods encompass two different phases of the advanced design process and are {{used to compare the}} relative advantages of two concepts in these phases. The first is a Monte Carlo simulation during the conceptual phase of design, where <b>mold</b> <b>lines</b> can be changed to account for uncertainty in weight assumptions. This tests the vehicle weight growth for a fixed mission. Here, the all-rocket single stage to orbit (SSTO) shows a more narrow distribution of dry weight, suggesting higher concept robustness. A study of vehicle mass ratio and mixture ratio combinations for both vehicles show the relative location of the results. The second phase represents the transition to detailed design. An optimization based on length determines the appropriate size for detailed design. This optimization takes into account uncertainties placed on both weight relationsh [...] ...|$|E

To validate overall system performance, a flight demonstration must be performed. This paper presents an overview of the first phase of a flight demonstration program for the GTX SSTO vehicle concept. Phase 1 will validate the propulsion performance of the vehicle configuration over the supersonic and hypersonic air- breathing portions of the trajectory. The focus and goal of Phase 1 is to demonstrate the integration and performance of the propulsion system flowpath with the vehicle aerodynamics over the air-breathing trajectory. This demonstrator vehicle will have dual mode ramjetkcramjets, which include the inlet, combustor, and nozzle with geometrically scaled aerodynamic surface outer <b>mold</b> <b>lines</b> (OML) defining the forebody, boundary layer diverter, wings, and tail.

To minimize overall risk and develop ment cost the effort will incorporate proven materials, use existing turbomachinery in the propellant delivery systems, launch from an existing unmanned remote launch facility, and use basic vehicle recovery techniques to minimize control and landing requirements.

40|$|A {{synoptic}} of programmatic {{and technical}} lessons {{learned in the}} development of aerothermodynamic data bases for the X- 33 and X- 34 programs is presented in general terms and {{from the perspective of the}} NASA Langley Research Center Aerothermodynamics Branch. The format used is that of the "aerothermodynamic chain," the links of which are personnel, facilities, models/test articles, instrumentation, test techniques, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Because the aerodynamic data bases upon which the X- 33 and X- 34 vehicles will fly are almost exclusively from wind tunnel testing, as opposed to CFD, the primary focus of the lessons learned is on ground-based testing. The period corresponding to the development of X- 33 and X- 34 aerothermodynamic data bases was challenging, since a number of other such programs (e. g., X- 38, X- 43) competed for resources at a time of downsizing of personnel, facilities, etc., outsourcing, and role changes as NASA Centers served as subcontractors to industry. The impact of this changing environment is embedded in the lessons learned. From a technical perspective, the relatively long times to design and fabricate metallic force and moment models, delays in delivery of models, and a lack of quality assurance to determine the fidelity of model outer <b>mold</b> <b>lines</b> (OML) prior to wind tunnel testing had a major negative impact on the programs. On the positive side, the application of phosphor thermography to obtain global, quantitative heating distributions on rapidly fabricated ceramic models revolutionized the aerothermodynamic optimization of vehicle OMLs, control surfaces, etc. Vehicle designers were provided with aeroheating information prior to, or in conjunction with, aerodynamic information early in the program, thereby allowing trades to be made with both sets of input; in the past only aerodynamic data were available as input. Programmatically, failure to include transonic aerodynamic wind tunnel tests early in the assessment phase led to delays in the optimization phase, as OMLs required modification to provide adequate transonic aerodynamic performance without sacrificing subsonic and hypersonic performance. Funding schedules for industry, based on technical milestones, also presented challenges to aerothermodynamics seeking optimum flying characteristics across the subsonic to hypersonic speed regimes and minimum aeroheating. This paper is concluded with a brief discussion of enhancements in ground-based testing/CFD capabilities necessary to partially/fully satisfy future requirements...|$|E
40|$|The {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) comparisons being presented are compared {{to each other and}} to wind tunnel (WT) data on the baseline TCA. Some of the CFD computations were done prior to the tests and others later. Only force data (CL vs CD) from CFD will be presented as part of this report. The WT data presented comes from the testing of the baseline TCA in the Langley Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel (UPWT), Test Section # 2. There are 2 sets of wind tunnel data being presented: one from test 1671 of model 2 a (flapped wing) and the other from test 1679 of model 2 b (solid wing). Most of the plots show only one run from each of the WT tests per configuration. But many repeat runs were taken during the tests. The WT repeat runs showed an uncertainty in the drag of +/- 0. 5 count. There were times when the uncertainty in drag was better, +/- 0. 25 count. Test 1671 data was of forces and pressures measured from model 2 a. The wing had cutouts for installing various leading and trailing edge flaps at lower Mach numbers. The internal duct of the nacelles are not designed and fabricated as defined in the outer <b>mold</b> <b>lines</b> (OML) iges file. The internal duct was fabricated such that a linear transition occurs from the inlet to exhaust. Whereas, the iges definition has a constant area internal duct that quickly transitions from the inlet to exhaust cross sectional shape. The nacelle internal duct was fabricated, the way described, to save time and money. The variation in the cross sectional area is less than 1 % from the iges definition. The nacelles were also installed with and without fairings. Fairings are defined as the build up of the nacelles on the upper wing surface so that the nacelles poke through the upper surface as defined in the OML iges file. Test 1679 data was of forces measured from model 2 a and 2 b. The wing for model 2 b was a solid wing. The nacelles were built the same way as for model 2 a, except for the nacelle base pressure installation. The nacelles were only tested with the fairings for model 2 a and 2 b during test 1679...|$|E
