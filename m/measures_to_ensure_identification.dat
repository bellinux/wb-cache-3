40|$|Background and Purpose: Anxiety {{disorders}} impact negatively on {{morbidity and}} mortality poststroke. Few studies have, however, been done on poststroke anxiety disorders (PSAD), particularly in Africa. The study aims to determine the prevalence, associated clinicodemographic factors, and impact of PSAD on quality of life (QoL) among outpatients at a tertiary hospital in Nigeria. Methods: Seventy stroke survivors attending Outpatient Clinics at Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Nigeria, were recruited into the study. Participants were assessed using sociodemographic/clinical questionnaire, the modified Mini–Mental State Examination, the Modified Rankin Scale, the Schedule for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry, and the World Health Organization-QoL-Bref. Data collection took 5 months and analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS®) software version 17. 0. Results: The mean age of respondents was 57. 43 (± 9. 67) years and 38 respondents (54 %) were male. Majority of the stroke survivors had infarctive stroke 55 (78. 6 %), right hemispheric lesions 37 (52. 9 %), and significant poststroke disabilities 57 (81. 4 %). The prevalence of PSAD was 10 % and agoraphobia with panic attacks was elicited in 42. 8 % of those diagnosed with PSAD. Participants with PSAD {{were significantly more likely}} to be unemployed (P = 0. 01) and pay more than ₦ 10, 000 ($ 62. 50 at December 2013) monthly for health care. The mean QoL scores were lower in participants with PSAD across all QoL spheres, and significantly so for overall health (P = 0. 04), health satisfaction (P = 0. 02), and physical health (P = 0. 01) domains. Conclusion: PSAD, especially agoraphobia in association with unemployment and high health-care costs correlated with poor well-being among stroke survivors.
