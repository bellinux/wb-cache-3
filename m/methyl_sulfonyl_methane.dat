40|$|Although {{the immune}} system of shrimps is not {{comparable}} to that of vertebrates, shrimps can acquire protection against pathogenic challenge by building up immunity. In this study, formalin-inactivated virus (FIV) was administered by injection, bath-immersion, or orally to determine levels of vaccination-mediated protection against the pathogenic white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). Diets supplemented with alfalfa, <b>methyl</b> <b>sulfonyl</b> <b>methane</b> (MSM), or wheat grass were provided with or without FIV. Shrimp injected with FIV and challenged 3, 15, or 30 days after vaccination had cumulative and relative survivals of 83 %, 67 %, and 33 %, respectively. Survival of shrimp challenged by bath-immersion 3 - 45 days after vaccination by immersion was significantly higher than in the unvaccinated control. Orally vaccinated shrimp challenged by bath-immersion were partially protected up to 45 days after vaccination (cumulative survival 63. 7 %, relative 61. 7 %) but not til 60 days after vaccination (cumulative 8 %, relative 3. 2 %). Survival of unvaccinated shrimp challenged by bath-immersion improved when shrimp were fed a diet supplemented with wheat grass or MSM, but not alfalfa.

40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: Multiple {{in vitro studies}} assessing articular tissues have indicated that glucosamine and chondroitin sulphate may possess anti-inflammatory effects, but little is known of their clinical effects in vivo. Many old horses have stiff joints, {{which is likely to}} be attributable to inflammation and therapy with these nutraceutical compounds could improve joint function. Objectives: To assess the clinical effects of a mixed supplement on the improvement of stiff gait in aged horses. Study design: Randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled study. Methods: A group of 24 geriatric equids (age 29 +/- 4 years; mean +/- s. d.) received either 3 months oral supplementation with a test compound (containing glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate and <b>methyl</b> <b>sulfonyl</b> <b>methane),</b> or a placebo. Kinematic outcome criteria (primary: stride length; secondary: carpal flexion, fore fetlock extension and tarsal range of motion) were objectively quantified on a treadmill at a walk and trot before and after treatment. Results: Stride length did not change significantly in the treated horses {{at the end of the}} trial. In the control group, carpal flexion and fore fetlock extension were significantly increased (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: There were no indications of effect of the supplement on gait characteristics. The observations in the control group may have been due to a habituation or exercise effect. This study does not support the use of a glucosamine/chondroitin sulfate/methyl sulfonyl methane supplement to improve stiff gait in geriatric horses because of the lack of a sizeable effect. The significant changes in gait parameters in the control group may indicate the usefulness of exercise regimens in older horses...|$|E

30|$|The {{synthesis}} of EFB was achieved via mercury sulfide precipitation-driven stepwise amine addition in moderate yields, possibly due to {{interaction of the}} transition metal with the guanidine moiety. Radiolabelling was achieved in three steps starting from compound 4, achieving an overall DC RCY of 3 – 5 %, > 99 % RCP and > 300  GBq/μmol molar activity. The RCY was mostly limited by the inherently high unknown by-product formation in the final step of the process. This could consist in a cyclised or truncated form of [18 F]EFB, which could be limited by the replacement of precursor 6 with an analogue with a more labile leaving group, such as <b>sulfonyl</b> <b>methane</b> [29] or <b>sulfonyl</b> chloride [30]. However, some preliminary attempts at oxidising the thiomethyl group with 2  eq. oxone at room temperature or m-CPBA at − 20  °C resulted in over-oxidation of compound 6.

The shear modulus of elasticity increased slowly and after several days attained a constant value, which was {{lower than those of}} alpha-fibrin or alpha beta-fibrin under the same conditions. Before studying the temperature dependence of elasticity, the CVE was then inhibited by introducing phenyl <b>methyl</b> <b>sulfonyl</b> chloride (PMSF) by diffusion.

Creep and creep recovery measurements on unligated clots showed creep rates and irrecoverable deformation that were similar in magnitude to those of alpha-fibrin clots formed with batroxobin and much larger than those of alpha beta-fibrin clots formed with thrombin, under the same conditions.

40|$|Selective {{inhibition}} of the inducible isoform of prostaglandin G/H synthase (cyclooxygenase- 2; COX 2; EC 1. 14. 99. 1) {{can be achieved}} with compounds of the general form of aryl <b>methyl</b> <b>sulfonyls</b> and aryl <b>methyl</b> sulfonamides. DuP 697 and NS- 398 are representative examples of these compounds. Both inhibit the constitute (COX 1) and inducible (COX 2) isoforms of the enzyme with equal potency shortly after mixing, but their potencies increase with time for COX 2 selectively. This time-dependent inhibition follows first-order kinetics, and the rate constant for inactivation of COX 2 is dose dependent for both compounds. Kinetic analysis allows us to determine KI and kinact (the maximal rate of inactivation) for each inhibitor. The potency of both compounds is substrate concentration dependent, as expected for time-dependent competitive inhibitors. COX 2 that has been incubated with these inhibitors, and then extensively dialyzed against buffer, shows no recovery of enzyme activity, while complete recovery of activity is seen for COX 1. Thus, these inhibitors irreversibly inactivate COX 2 with time, while showing minimal reversible {{inhibition of}} COX 1. We isolated these inhibitors after long incubation with excess enzyme and subsequent denaturation of the enzyme. Both inhibitors showed no loss of potency resulting from interactions with COX 2, suggesting that inhibition is not mediated by covalent modification of the enzyme.

The blue secretion was found to metabolize (preferentially) para-amino benzoic acid, a substrate for N-acetyl transferase (NAT), thereby indicating acetyl transferase like activity of the secretion. Attempts were also made to characterise bioactive fraction of the blue secretion and to further use this as a biomarker for monitoring of marine pollution. NAT like enzyme from marine mollusc is a potential candidate for detoxification of different harmful chemicals. A partially purified extract of blue secretion was obtained by fractional precipitation with (NH 4) 2 SO 4. From different fractions obtained by precipitation, the 0 – 30 % fraction (30 S) displayed NAT like activity (using para amino benzoic acid as a substrate with para nitrophenyl phosphate or acetyl coenzyme A as acetyl group donors). Maximum NAT like enzyme activity was attained at 25 °C and at a pH of 6. The enzyme activity was found to be inhibited by 5  mM phenyl <b>methyl</b> <b>sulfonyl</b> fluoride. The divalent metal ions reduced NAT like activity of 30 S. Moreover, Cu 2 + and Zn 2 + (at concentration of 1  mM) completely inhibited NAT activity. The thermal stability and bench-top stability studies were performed and {{it was found that the}} enzyme was stable at room temperature for more than 24  hours. Results from the present study further indicate that heavy metal content in blue secretion gradually decreased from pre-monsoon to post-monsoon season, which also corresponded to the change in NAT like activity. Therefore, this article stresses the importance of biomarker research for monitoring pollution.|$|R

The crude lipase extract had an activity of 41. 7 LU/ml of culture medium when the bacterium was cultured for 48 h at 37 °C and pH 8. 0 with nutrient broth supplemented with sardine oil as carbon source. The enzyme was purified 208 -fold with 8. 36 % recovery and a specific activity of 520 LU/mg after gel exclusion chromatography.

The binding of [125 I]Hageman factor to the negatively charged surface was markedly inhibited by plasma or purified plasma proteins. Activation of Hageman factor in solution (fluid phase) was obtained with kallikrein, plasmin, and Factor XI (plasma thromboplastin antecedent). Kallikrein was greater than 10 times more active in its ability to activate Hageman factor than plasmin and Factor XI. The data offer a plausible explanation for the finding that highly purified kallikrein promotes clotting of normal plasma. In addition, the combined results of this and previously reported data from this laboratory indicate that the reciprocal {{activation of}} Hageman factor by kallikrein in fluid phase is essential for normal rate of activation of the intrinsic-clotting, kinin-forming, and fibrinolytic systems. Activation of Hageman factor was associated with three different structural changes in the molecule: (a) Purified Hageman factor, activated on negatively charged surfaces retained its native mol wt of 80 – 90, 000. Presumably a conformational change accompanied activation. (b) In fluid phase, activation with kallikrein and plasmin did not result in cleavage of large fragments of rabbit Hageman factor, although the activation required hydrolytic capacity of the enzymes. (c) Activation of human Hageman factor with kallikrein or plasmin was associated with cleavage of the molecule to 52, 000, 40, 000, and 28, 000 mol wt fragments.

This partial inhibition was found to occur only if PMSF was present during pulse-labeling. Intracellular Pp 70 and Pp 60 and FeLV virion p 70, p 30, p 15, p 11, and p 10 were subjected to tryptic peptide analysis. The results of this tryptic peptide analysis demonstrated that intracellular Pp 70 and virion p 70 were identical and that both contained the tryptic peptides of FeLV p 30, p 15, p 11, and p 10. Pp 60 contained the tryptic peptides of FeLV P 30, P 15, and P 10, but lacked the tryptic peptides of P 11. The results of pactamycin gene ordering experiments indicated that the small structural proteins of FeLV are ordered p 11 -p 15 -p 10 -p 30. The data indicate that the small structural proteins of FeLV are synthesized as part of a 70, 000 -dalton precursor.

40|$|Background: A {{series of}} studies has {{suggested}} some efficacy of glucosamine in arthrosis of the knee, but virtually no documentation exists regarding its effects on low back pain. Objectives: The primary objective {{of this study was}} to examine whether a 12 -week course of a glucosamine complex (GC) could benefit patients having low back pain despite a course of noninvasive physical therapy. In addition, we sought to delineate the subgroup of responders. Methods: This open-label, randomized, controlled study was conducted at the Division of Rheumatology and Physical Medicine, Erasme University Hospital, Brussels, Belgium. Male and female outpatients aged 40 to 80 years with low back pain (duration, < 12 weeks; pain score on 10 -cm visual analog scale [VAS] [0 = none to 10 = worst imaginable], < 3 cm) despite noninvasive physical therapy (massage, stretching, heat application, and analgesics for < 4 weeks) were included. Patients were randomly assigned to receive, in addition to conventional treatment (CT) (physical therapy plus analgesics/ antiinflammatories), a GC (enriched with <b>sulfonyl</b> <b>methane,</b> silicon, and a botanical extract of Ribes nigrum) or CT alone (control) for 12 weeks. Pain at rest and on movement (effort) and early morning lumbar stiffness were measured every 4 weeks using the VAS. The primary end point was improvement in VAS score for pain at rest at 12 weeks. Two validated questionnaires were used to assess improvements in quality of life (QOL) (Oswestry Disability Questionnaire [ODQ] [10 items; scale: 0 = no disability to 60 = maximal disability] and Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire [RMDQ] [24 items; scale: 0 = no disability to 24 = severe disability]). Responders were defined as patients who positively assessed the efficacy of the GC. At each visit, patients were also asked about possible adverse events. Results: Of 36 enrolled patients, 32 completed the study (18 men, 14 women; mean [SE] age, 64 [2] years; 17 in the GC group and 15 in the control group). Four patients were lost to follow-up. At week 4, changes from baseline VAS scores for pain at rest and lumbar stiffness were significantly greater in the GC group compared with the control group (P < 0. 001 and P = 0. 011, respectively). At week 4, QOL was found to be improved, as measured using the ODQ, in the GC group compared with the control group (P = 0. 028), but the between-group difference as measured using the RMDQ was not significant. The improvements from baseline on the questionnaires were sustained over the 12 -week period in the GC group (all, P < 0. 001). Gastrointestinal adverse effects were reported by 1 GC-treated patient and 1 patient in the control group, but neither patient withdrew from the study. Of the 17 GC-treated patients, 9 considered themselves responders, but the profile of a responder could not be delineated. Conclusions: In this study in patients with low back pain, analgesic effect and improvement in QOL were found with the use of GC. GC was well tolerated. Copyright © 2005 Excerpta Medica, Inc.

40|$|Objective/background: Tuberculosis (TB) {{has been}} {{declared}} as a global emergency by the World Health Organization in 1993 and still {{remains one of the}} world's biggest threats. Worldwide, 9. 6 million people have been estimated to have fallen ill with TB in 2014 : 5. 4 million men, 3. 2 million women, and 1. 0 million children. To reduce this burden, detection and treatment gaps must be addressed and new tools developed (Global TB report 2015). Methods: Seroreactivity of the purified excretory secretory (ES) antigens ES- 31, ES- 43, ES- 41, and ES- 6 have been assessed in pulmonary TB (fresh, relapse, chronic, and latent), extrapulmonary TB, and in human immunodeficiency virus-TB coinfection. Results: Analysis of immune response to these purified antigens by indirect and sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using sensitive penicillinase enzyme-immuno assay, showed ES- 31 antigen as having good diagnostic potential in pulmonary TB and in certain groups of extrapulmonary TB, in particular tuberculous lymphadenopathy, tuberculous meningitis, whereas ES- 41 was found to be more seroreactive in abdominal and bone and joint TB. ES- 43 antigen was primarily recognized by serum antibodies in relapse cases, while ES- 6 was useful in contacts. Antigen assay was found to be more sensitive than antibody-based assay for detecting TB with human immunodeficiency virus coinfection. Immunomonitoring for the presence of antigens in TB patients under antitubercular treatment showed that ES- 31 antigen assay was useful in determining the effectiveness of therapy and the patient's compliance. User-friendly peroxidase ELISA has been standardized for the detection of circulating mycobacterial ES- 31 serine protease (free antigen and immune-complexed antigen) with 70 – 75 % sensitivity and 90 % specificity and with a limit of detection of antigen at 1 ng/ 2 μL (0. 5 μg/mL serum). In-house developed SEVA TB ELISA assay using a cocktail of antigens (ES- 31 +EST- 6) and a cocktail of specific antibodies is being routinely done for screening of patients suspected of TB attending Kasturba Hospital—a tertiary health care center. The characterization of ES- 31 antigen protein showed that ES- 31 is a 31 -kDa protein antigen with zinc containing serine protease as well as lipase activities and shown to be a chymotrypsin-like protein which has the catalytic triad responsible for both the activities. Addition of serine protease inhibitors: (1) pefabloc; (2) 3, 4 dichloroisocoumarin; (3) phenyl <b>methyl</b> <b>sulfonyl</b> fluoride (53 – 76 %); and metallo-protease inhibitors: (1) EDTA; (2) 1, 10 phenanthroline (46 – 61 %), lipase inhibitor, orlistat (61 %), or anti-ES- 31 serine protease antibody (89 %) inhibited the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) H 37 Ra growth in axenic culture which is further confirmed by a decreased amount of ES- 31 protein secreted in the culture filtrate. The importance of excretory secretory ES- 31 protein for the survival of MTB H 37 Ra and H 37 Rv bacilli has been shown by 77 % and 78 % growth inhibition in macrophage culture by protease inhibitor pefabloc and was further confirmed by the enhancement of growth of TB bacilli in the presence of ES- 31. Conclusion: Inhibition of ES- 31 leads to the growth inhibition of MTB bacilli, suggesting that ES- 31 is important for entry and multiplication of bacilli and an important drug target for exploring new drugs for TB based on protease and lipase activities of ES- 31 protein...|$|R
40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} is {{the most}} commonly seen arrhythmia in the geriatric population and is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Treatment of the elderly with atrial fibrillation remains challenging for physicians, because this unique subpopulation is characterized by multiple comorbidities requiring chronic use of numerous medications, which can potentially lead to severe drug interactions. Furthermore, age-related changes in the cardiovascular system {{as well as other}} physiological changes result in altered drug pharmacokinetics. Dronedarone is a new drug recently approved for the treatment of arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation and/or atrial flutter. Dronedarone is a benzofuran amiodarone analog which lacks the iodine moiety and contains a <b>methane</b> <b>sulfonyl</b> group that decreases its lipophilicity. These differences in chemical structure are responsible for making dronedarone less toxic than amiodarone which, in turn, results in fewer side effects. Adverse events for dronedarone include gastrointestinal side effects and rash. No dosage adjustments are required for patients with renal impairment. However, the use of dronedarone is contraindicated in the presence of severe hepatic dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|Historically, {{electrochemical}} reduction of organic compounds {{was performed in}} a protic mixture of dioxin-water using the traditional polarography with a dropping mercury electrode. In 1952, acetonitrile, an aprotic solvent, was first employed by Wawzonek and then was adopted by electrochemists as the default solvent for electrochemical studies. Being a prototype for organic compounds, the {{electrochemical reduction}} of stilbene was investigated in acetonitrile. Although an electrochemically reversible process generating the stilbene radical anion can be obtained in acetonitrile, the second process was irreversible. However, despite this success and its great advantages, the drawback of such an organic solvent system {{is associated with the}} presence of adventitious or solvent or electrolyte protons that may interfere with the electrochemical reduction. In addition, earlier studies in organic solvents failed to detect the variation between the trans- and cis stilbene isomers. An ultimate goal of this thesis is to reduce organic compounds via the addition of multi electrons and to stabilise the reduced species under ambient conditions. This required investigating a set of organic solvents and ionic liquids that may meet the desired characteristics. This thesis showed that trans- and cis-stilbene initially undergo a chemically reversible one-electron reduction to their radical anions at very negative potentials, but with the trans-form being more readily reduced than the cis-form in MeCN or IL. Furthermore, while the trans reduction to the radical anion is electrochemically reversible, the cis process is more complex. Further reduction is irreversible (in most solvents) with the cis radical anion being more readily reduced to its dianion than the trans¬-form. This irreversibility is due to proton abstraction from the solvent, electrolyte or adventitious water. The thesis also exposed an additional property for the boronium cation based ionic liquid, (ethyl dimethyl ammonio) (trimethyl ammonio) dihydroborate bis (trifluoro <b>methyl</b> <b>sulfonyl)</b> amide, ILB; its anion lacks a proton and none of the cation protons is readily available. In ILB a new form of room temperature voltammetric behaviour of stilbene is unveiled; two consecutive chemically reversible reduction processes for trans- and cis-stilbene are detected with the trans form being more highly favoured upon reduction. Accordingly, the boronium based ionic liquid provides an opportunity to generate stable multi-electron reduced organic compounds at very negative potential {{for the first time at}} room temperature. After achieving encouraging outcomes with stilbene, this thesis examined and compared the electrochemical reduction of a series of organic molecules in MeCN or IL. Introduction of a substituent into stilbene shifts the first and the second reduction processes of both the trans- or the cis isomer to either less or more negative potentials. The substituent type (functional group) or position (ortho or para) can have a dramatically different effect on either isomer reduction. The electrochemical reduction of conjugated olefins and polyaromatic helicenes was investigated. In brief, olefins were successfully and reversibly reduced via addition of two or more electrons. The important findings of this work clearly establish that ionic liquids may provide better alternative of the traditional protic or organic solvents for the electro-reduction of organic molecules by eliminating the source of protons. However, irreversible reduction of polyaromatic hydrocarbons arises from dimerisation of the dianion rather than its protonation. Therefore, in this situation ILB could not induce reversible reduction of polyaromatic compounds. Another condition that can permit multi-electron reduction of stilbene is the incorporation of TCNQ with stilbene to form a charge-transfer complex. Electrochemical reduction of TCNQ is reversible in most organic solvents. Cyclic voltammograms of the chemically-synthesized STB-TCNQ charge transfer complex revealed four reversible reduction processes. This behaviour implies that the association and interaction between the complex components (STB and TCNQ) and the intra molecular interactions help to stabilise the generated stilbene dianion, by preventing it from reacting with adventitious proton. In summary, the major conclusion from this thesis is then ILB could constitute a nouvel step towards the development and adoption of a third generation solvent system for organic electrochemistry with the potential to stabilise multi-electron reduced species for water-sensitive compounds...|$|R
