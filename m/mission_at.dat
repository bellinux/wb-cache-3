5|$|By {{the start}} of the operation, Bismarcks crew had {{increased}} to 2,221 officers and enlisted men. This included an admiral's staff of nearly 65 and a prize crew of 80 sailors, who could be used to crew transports captured during the <b>mission.</b> <b>At</b> 02:00 on 19 May, Bismarck departed Gotenhafen and made for the Danish straits. She was joined at 11:25 by Prinz Eugen, which had departed the previous night at 21:18, off Cape Arkona. The two ships were escorted by three destroyers—, , and —and a flotilla of minesweepers. The Luftwaffe provided air cover during the voyage out of German waters. At around noon on 20 May, Lindemann informed the ship's crew via loudspeaker of the ship's <b>mission.</b> <b>At</b> approximately the same time, a group of ten or twelve Swedish aircraft flying reconnaissance encountered the German force and reported its composition and heading, though the Germans did not see the Swedes.|$|E
5|$|A nearby village, Niguili, {{was located}} {{near the mouth of}} Aliso Creek likely near the {{confluence}} of Aliso and Sulphur Creeks. Present-day Laguna Niguel takes its name from this settlement. The Acjachemen were renamed the Juaneño by Spanish priests in the 18th century, who established a <b>mission</b> <b>at</b> the present-day location of San Juan Capistrano. Following the Spanish arrival, most Juaneño clustered around the mission in the south. Like many other once widespread Juaneño villages, Niguili was likely abandoned soon after, and there is no trace of it remaining.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{thirteen}} other pilots, Chaffee {{was selected}} {{to be an astronaut}} as part of NASA Astronaut Group 3 in 1963. He served as capsule communicator (CAPCOM) for the Gemini 3 and Gemini 4 missions, and received his first spaceflight assignment in 1966. In 1967, he died in a fire along with fellow astronauts Virgil (Gus) Grissom and Edward H. White II during a pre-launch test for the Apollo 1 <b>mission</b> <b>at</b> what was then the Cape Kennedy Air Force Station Launch Complex 34, Florida. He was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor and a second Air Medal.|$|E

5|$|By {{the evening}} of August20, Bret was {{designated}} a hurricane following reports of 75mph (120km/h) winds during a Hurricane Hunter <b>mission.</b> <b>At</b> around the same time, Bret established a north-northwest track under the influences of a mid-level ridge. The following day, Bret began to undergo rapid intensification, as a well-defined eye developed. On the morning of August22, the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category4 hurricane with winds of 145mph (230km/h) and a barometric pressure of 944mbar (hPa; 27.88inHg). Shortly thereafter, an upper-level trough {{to the west of}} the storm began to erode its cloud pattern.|$|E
5|$|California {{has been}} {{inhabited}} by numerous Native American peoples since antiquity. The Spanish, the Russians, and other Europeans began exploring and colonizing {{the area in}} the 16th and 17th centuries, with the Spanish establishing its first California <b>mission</b> <b>at</b> what is now San Diego in 1769. After the Mexican Cession of 1848, the California Gold Rush brought worldwide attention to the area. The growth of the movie industry in Los Angeles and Hollywood, high tech in Silicon Valley, tourism, agriculture, and other areas in the ensuing decades fueled the creation of a $1.85 trillion economy, the ninth-largest in the world.|$|E
5|$|In 1838, Belcourt {{travelled}} to Rainy Lake {{to examine}} sites for a mission. He abandoned the plan after discovering that the First Nations people {{were unwilling to}} give up their Hudson's Bay Company-supplied liquor, as he required for conversion to Christianity. In August 1838, the priest arranged to have a dictionary published in the Chippewa language, and returned to his <b>mission</b> <b>at</b> Baie-Saint-Paul.

5|$|In 1840, {{the missionary}} {{established}} a mission among the Wabaseemoong Independent Nations, where he repeated his Baie-Saint-Paul design: a log chapel at the centre surrounded by small cabins {{for the local}} population, with outlying farms. The mission closed ten years later; Belcourt blamed this on mismanagement by oblates he had entrusted with its management. In 1845, Belcourt served as the chaplain to some buffalo hunters, but returned to his first <b>mission</b> <b>at</b> Baie-Saint-Paul to teach the Chippewa language {{to a group of}} oblates.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 {{and into}} 2004, the brigade {{deployed}} {{for the first}} time to Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.

5|$|In late October, Andrić {{left for}} Belgrade. He became {{involved}} in the city's literary circles and soon acquired the distinction of being one of Belgrade's most popular young writers. Though the Belgrade press wrote positively of him, Andrić disliked being a public figure, and went into seclusion and distanced himself from his fellow writers. At the same time, he grew dissatisfied with his government job and wrote to Alaupović asking for a transfer to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On 20 February, Andrić's request was granted and he was assigned to the Foreign Ministry's <b>mission</b> <b>at</b> the Vatican.|$|E

Mbombwe's fall and the government troops' subsequent demolition of Chilembwe's church with dynamite ended the rebellion. Kaduya was captured and brought back to Magomero where he was publicly executed.|$|E
5|$|Sedna {{will come}} to {{perihelion}} around 2075–2076. This close approach to the Sun {{provides an opportunity for}} study that will not occur again for 12,000 years.

5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of Melbourne and Cambridge University, where he earned his doctorate at the Cavendish Laboratory, Massey became an independent lecturer in Mathematical Physics at the Queen's University of Belfast in 1933.

During the Second World War, Massey worked at the Admiralty Research Laboratory , where he helped devise countermeasures for German magnetic naval mines, and at the Admiralty Mining Establishment in Havant, where he helped develop British naval mines. In 1943, Mark Oliphant persuaded the Admiralty to release Massey {{to work on the}} Manhattan Project. He joined Oliphant's British <b>Mission</b> <b>at</b> the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California, where they worked on the electromagnetic isotope separation process.

5|$|According to a NASA document, Laika {{was placed}} in the capsule of the {{satellite}} on 31 October 1957—three days {{before the start of the}} <b>mission.</b> <b>At</b> that time of year, the temperatures at the launch site were extremely cold, and a hose connected to a heater was used to keep her container warm. Two assistants were assigned to keep a constant watch on Laika before launch. Just prior to liftoff on 3 November 1957, from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Laika's fur was sponged in a weak alcohol solution and carefully groomed, while iodine was painted onto the areas where sensors would be placed to monitor her bodily functions.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}}, 6. Staffel {{at the time}} was based in Petsamo, present-day Pechenga in Murmansk Oblast, Russia. Weissenberger took off on his first Bf109 combat <b>mission</b> <b>at</b> 14:00 on 15 September 1942 after he had spent a few days familiarizing himself with the {{single-engine}} fighter aircraft. The mission, flown by 10 Bf109 fighters from 6. Staffel, was a combat air patrol in the vicinity of Murmashi. The flight encountered enemy aircraft and Weissenberger filed claims over two Curtiss P-40 Warhawk Lend-Lease fighters shot down at 14:31 and 14:33. These were his first victories claimed on the Bf109, taking his total to 25 victories. A week later, on 22 September, Weissenberger and 6.
