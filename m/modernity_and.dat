5|$|Bengali film actor Prosenjit Chatterjee {{encouraged}} Ghosh {{to shoot}} in Kolkata. Ghosh finally selected Kolkata for several reasons: the director's acquaintance with the city, its mix of <b>modernity</b> <b>and</b> old-world charm, and budget constraints. Kolkata is a cheaper location than Mumbai or Delhi, where most Bollywood films are shot.|$|E
5|$|Besides being a major {{political}} and economic centre to the state, the city is also the main gateway {{to many of the}} state's tourist destinations. The attractions in and around the city include Kampung Cina, Pasar Besar Kedai Payang, Terengganu State Museum, and Batu Buruk Beach. Even though the city is not spared from <b>modernity</b> <b>and</b> development, Kuala Terengganu still retains strong Malay influences that are intermixed with other cultures from its long history as a port.|$|E

5|$|Despite the <b>modernity</b> <b>and</b> {{the merit}} of the works {{produced}} {{and the ability of}} its protagonists, the historiography of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia was never able to win the honors of artistic and literary culture, neither at the time, nor in the following centuries, being forgotten even by the local sources. The main cause {{is to be found in}} a long series of errors and omissions that occurred in the critical literature from the earliest days until the twentieth century, which led to the misunderstanding of the cultural level and quality achieved by the Brescia school during the thirty years from the turn of the fifteenth century, and the oblivion of its main characters.|$|E
5|$|Filmmakers {{also made}} feature-length documentaries {{that covered the}} dark {{recesses}} of the globe, including the Amazon rainforest, Native American settlements, the Pacific islands, and everywhere in between. Taking advantage of audiences' voyeuristic impulses, aided by the allowance of nudity in tribal documentaries, the filming of lands untouched by <b>modernity,</b> <b>and</b> the presentation of locales never before filmed, these movies placated Depression era American audiences by showing them lifestyles more difficult than their own. Also captured were Arctic expeditions in films such 90° South and With Byrd at the South Pole, and Sub-Saharan Africa in the safari films of Martin and Osa Johnson, among others.|$|E
5|$|Mihardja, a journalist-cum-literary {{editor who}} {{associated}} with the eccentric poet Chairil Anwar and the Socialist Party of Indonesia, wrote Atheis from May 1948 to February 1949. The Indonesian used in the novel was influenced by Sundanese and harkens back to earlier works by Minang writers, as opposed to Mihardja's contemporaries who attempted {{to distance themselves from}} the earlier style. Dealing mainly with faith, the novel also touches on the interactions between <b>modernity</b> <b>and</b> traditionalism. Although the writer insisted that the work was meant to be realistic, symbolic representations from subjective meanings to the novel being an allegory have been advanced.|$|E

40|$|This paper argues {{the need}} to widen the {{discourse}} of modern architecture through an exploration of <b>modern(ities)</b> in Asia, <b>and</b> posits that <b>modern(ities)</b> of East <b>and</b> West are intertwined. The constructed and contested nature of identities, {{through the medium of}} colonial exhibitions, is discussed. Using Japan and India as examples, the paper examines the notion of one, none or many <b>modernities</b> <b>and</b> argues that there are multiple alternative modern(ities) that need to be theorised for different locations. The alternative <b>modernities</b> <b>and</b> their dilemmas are posited as being linked to postcolonial constructions of identities, albeit in different ways and in different Asian contexts. The Asian architect, while being both the product and subject of different types of historical lineages and power constellations, has been a key agent in the manifestations of modernity in different locations...|$|R
5|$|Since iron was {{becoming}} cheaper and more plentiful, it {{also became a}} major structural material following {{the building of the}} innovative first iron bridge in 1778. This bridge still stands today as a monument to the role iron played in the Industrial Revolution. Following this, iron was used in rails, boats, ships, aqueducts, and buildings, as well as in iron cylinders in steam engines. Railways have been central to the formation of <b>modernity</b> <b>and</b> ideas of progress and various languages (e.g. French, Spanish, Italien and German) refer to railways as iron road.|$|E
5|$|Skopje is an {{ethnically diverse}} city, and its urban {{sociology}} primarily depends on {{ethnic and religious}} belonging. Macedonians form 66% of the city population, while Albanians and Roma account respectively for 20% and 6%. Each ethnic group generally restrict itself to {{certain areas of the}} city. Macedonians live south of the Vardar, in areas massively rebuilt after 1963, and Muslims live on the northern side, in the oldest neighbourhoods of the city. These neighbourhoods are considered more traditional, whereas the south side evokes to Macedonians <b>modernity</b> <b>and</b> rupture from rural life.|$|E
5|$|The {{music group}} Chari Jazz formed in 1964 and {{initiated}} Chad's modern music scene. Later, more renowned {{groups such as}} African Melody and International Challal attempted to mix <b>modernity</b> <b>and</b> tradition. Popular groups such as Tibesti have clung faster to their heritage by drawing on sai, a traditional style of music from southern Chad. The people of Chad have customarily disdained modern music. However, in 1995 greater interest has developed and fostered the distribution of CDs and audio cassettes featuring Chadian artists. Piracy {{and a lack of}} legal protections for artists' rights remain problems to further development of the Chadian music industry.|$|E

5|$|Weber {{also made}} {{a variety of other}} {{contributions}} in economic history, as well as economic theory and methodology. Weber's analysis of <b>modernity</b> <b>and</b> rationalisation significantly influenced the critical theory associated with the Frankfurt School. After the First World War, Max Weber was among the founders of the liberal German Democratic Party. He also ran unsuccessfully for a seat in parliament and served as advisor to the committee that drafted the ill-fated democratic Weimar Constitution of 1919.

5|$|A new offer {{had arrived}} for Pei from the Chinese {{government}} in 1982. With {{an eye toward}} the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong from the British in 1997, authorities in China sought Pei's aid on a new tower for the local branch of the Bank of China. The Chinese government was preparing for {{a new wave of}} engagement with the outside world and sought a tower to represent <b>modernity</b> <b>and</b> economic strength. Given the elder Pei's history with the bank before the Communist takeover, government officials visited the 89-year-old man in New York to gain approval for his son's involvement. Pei then spoke with his father at length about the proposal. Although the architect remained pained by his experience with Fragrant Hill, he agreed to accept the commission.|$|E
5|$|Nouakchott was a tiny, {{fortified}} {{fishing village}} (ksar) in pre-colonial times and under French rule. As Mauritania prepared for independence, it lacked a capital {{city and the}} area of present-day Nouakchott was chosen by Moktar Ould Daddah and his advisors. Ould Daddah desired for the new capital to be a symbol of <b>modernity</b> <b>and</b> national unity which ruled out existing cities or towns in the interior. The village {{was selected as the}} capital city for its central location between Saint-Louis, Senegal, the city from which the colony of Mauritania was governed, and Nouadhibou. Its location also meant that it avoided the sensitive issue of whether the capital was built in an area dominated by the Arab-descended Moors or Black Africans.|$|E
