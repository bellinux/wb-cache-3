50|$|Gertrude Robinson, {{using her}} methods for the {{synthesis}} of higher fatty acids, synthesized n-triacontanoic acid, also known as <b>Melissic</b> <b>acid,</b> and 13-oxodotetracontanoic acid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Melissic</b> <b>acid</b> {{gets its}} name from the Greek word melissa meaning bee, owing to its {{abundance}} in the nectar of the flowers which attract bees.|$|E
30|$|A {{series of}} hydrocarbons, {{predominantly}} nonacosane and hentriacontane, plus the methyl esters of palmitic, oleic, stearic, tetracosanoic, montanic and <b>melissic</b> <b>acids</b> were also detected in PRM 27, signifying a composite substance, and which may indicate a presence of beeswax [22, 32]. No beeswax {{is evident in}} PRM 28. This difference provides {{an explanation for the}} difference in character between the samples, whereby PRM 27 is soft and waxy, and PRM 28 is glassy and brittle (Table  1). It also concurs with the description of PRM 27 originating from ‘wild bees’ nests’.|$|R
5000|$|Sugarcane wax {{consists}} of the following ingredients: about 70 % of alcohols of long-chain hydrocarbons having chain lengths of C 18 to C 32, wax acids having chain lengths of C 18 to C 32, ω-hydroxycarboxylic acids and aromatic carboxylic acids. Also fatty alcohols (wax alcohols) and diols are alcohol components. Besides that, about 5 to 10 % consist of unesterified diols, long-chain wax acids such as behenic, cerotic, lignoceric or <b>melissic</b> <b>acid</b> and saturated hydrocarbons. Untreated sugarcane wax contains up to 25 % of resin and moreover, up to 60 % polycosanol (octacosanol) which can be extracted from sugarcane wax in the pure form.|$|E

40|$|A {{reversible}} thermotropic {{phase transition}} in an adsorption <b>melissic</b> <b>acid</b> film at {{the interface between}} n-hexane and an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide (pH= 10) is investigated by X-ray reflectometry and diffuse scattering using synchrotron radiation. The experimental data indicate that the interface "freezing" transition is accompanied {{not only by the}} crystallization of the Gibbs monolayer but also by the formation of a planar smectic structure in the ~ 300 -Angstrom-thick adsorption film; this structure is formed by ~ 50 -Angstrom-thick layers.

40|$|Ó The Author(s) 2011. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract The ultrasound contrast agents Echovist Ò and Levovist Ò (Bayer AG, Schering AG, Germany) {{are based on}} the release of gas bubbles from milled a-D-galactose. In diagnostic ultrasound, for this class of contrast agents, {{there is a need for}} prolonged contrast duration. To investigate if new carbohydrate compositions could prolong the lifetime of the gas bubbles, a-D-galactose was mixed with other carbohydrates or amphiphiles with varying log P. Acoustic attenuation vs. time (390 s) area under the curve (A 390) and bubble half-time (t‘) were used as measures of prolonged lifetime of gas bubbles. The products, to which 0. 1 % of a lipophilic carboxylic acid (5 b-cholanic acid, behenic acid, and <b>melissic</b> <b>acid)</b> has been added, showed more than 5, 7 and 11 times enhancement of A 390, respectively, compared with the reference compound 2 (RC 2) corresponding to the commercial product LevovistÒ.

40|$|The {{ultrasound}} contrast agents Echovist® and Levovist® (Bayer AG, Schering AG, Germany) {{are based}} on the release of gas bubbles from milled α-d-galactose. In diagnostic ultrasound, for this class of contrast agents, {{there is a need for}} prolonged contrast duration. To investigate if new carbohydrate compositions could prolong the lifetime of the gas bubbles, α-d-galactose was mixed with other carbohydrates or amphiphiles with varying log P. Acoustic attenuation vs. time (390  s) area under the curve (A 390) and bubble half-time (t½) were used as measures of prolonged lifetime of gas bubbles. The products, to which 0. 1 % of a lipophilic carboxylic acid (5 β-cholanic acid, behenic acid, and <b>melissic</b> <b>acid)</b> has been added, showed more than 5, 7 and 11 times enhancement of A 390, respectively, compared with the reference compound 2 (RC 2) corresponding to the commercial product Levovist®. The half-time t ½ of the same compounds was prolonged more than 6 times compared with RC 2. A partial least square (PLS) statistical analysis confirmed that, for additives, high log P carboxylic acids lead to the highest A 390. The present results bear a promise of products with a more persistent in vivo ultrasound contrast effect than the commercially available agents...|$|E
