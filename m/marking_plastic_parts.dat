40|$|External gas-assisted {{injection}} molding (EGAIM) {{technology can be}} applied to effectively reduce the sink marks generated from the shrinkage of <b>plastic</b> <b>parts.</b> In this paper, the interaction mechanism of gas and melting during the EGAIM stage was discussed. The causes of the sink <b>marks</b> on <b>plastic</b> <b>parts</b> as well as the influence of gas-melting interaction on the sink marks were analyzed. A corresponding physical model was established. Using <b>plastic</b> plate <b>parts</b> with stiffeners, for example, the EGAIM process was one-parameter simulated using Fluent software. The sink marks on the stiffeners, the interface morphology between the condensate layer and the gas, and other parameters were obtained. The effectiveness of the model, as well as the simulation process, was confirmed by experiment...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{surface of}} a part or product {{strongly}} influences its properties and functions. These are, e. g., abrasion and corrosion resistance, insensitivity to scratches, haptics {{as well as the}} visual impression to the customer. Therefore, many <b>plastic</b> <b>parts</b> have structured surfaces like leather textures on car dashboards. Usually these structures are integrated in the injection mould for the production of the <b>plastic</b> <b>parts</b> and then transferred to the <b>plastic</b> <b>parts</b> during the injection moulding process. A new approach to structuring metallic surfaces with laser radiation is structuring by remelting. Another approach of enhancing the appearance of design surfaces is creating a two-gloss effect by selective laser polishing. Both laser-based processes are based on reallocation of material instead of ablation...|$|R
