They are also the most prevalent bacteria causing bovine intramammary infections (IMI). Reservoirs and transmission routes of CNS are not yet fully unraveled. The objectives {{of this study were}} to explore the distribution of CNS in parlor-related extramammary niches and to compare it to the distributions of CNS causing IMI in those herds. Niches that were targeted in this study were cows’ teat apices, milking <b>machine</b> <b>unit</b> liners, and milker's skin or gloves. Each of the three herds had its own CNS microbiota in those niches. The most prevalent species in the parlor-related extramammary niches were Staphylococcus cohnii, S. fleurettii, and S. equorum in the first, second, and third herd, respectively, whereas S. haemolyticus and S. sciuri were found in all herds. S. cohnii and S. fleurettii, as well as S. haemolyticus, which was present in each herd, were also frequently found in milk samples. By contrast, S. chromogenes, S. simulans, and S. xylosus favored the mammary gland, whereas S. equorum was more common in the parlor-associated niches. Within each herd, species distribution was similar between teat apices and milking <b>machine</b> <b>unit</b> liners. In conclusion, some of the extramammary niches related to the milking process might act as infection sources for IMI-causing CNS. This study provides further evidence that the group of CNS species is comprised of environmental, opportunistic and host-adapted species which differ in ecology...|$|E

The A 356 aluminum alloy with 7 % silicon as its prime alloying element forms the popular material for the manufacture of automotive alloy wheel castings. The alloy wheel manufacturing process starts with ingots which form the input into the furnace of the melting section. After ladle preheating, the liquid metal treatment (degassing) is performed in the melting section. The die in the die maintenance area is preheated and sandblasted in order to clean the die surface, increase the surface finish and relieve the external surface stresses. Then, the prepared die is preserved in the Die preservation yard. As per the production schedule the required die is retrieved from the die preservation yard and then fitted onto the low-pressure die cast (LPDC) <b>machine</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E

The wheel casting {{coming out of the}} LPDC unit is quenched in water and is sent for checking internal casting defects in the non-destructive x-ray checking machine. After non-destructive x-ray check, the alloy wheel casting then follows the gate-cutting process, heat treatment, shot-blasting, CNC machining and air-leak testing. After air-leak test depending on the product requirement the alloy wheel is either sent to the paint line or sent to the Chrome Plating Plant. The paint line mainly consists of degreasing the machined alloy wheel, deoxidizing, conversion coating, pre-heating in dry-off oven, color coating and packing and dispatch. On the other hand, the machined wheels entering the Chrome Plating Plant are subjected to rigorous surface finish improvement by buffing operation. After this it enters the chrome plating process which consists of the copper plating line followed by chrome plating line.|$|E
