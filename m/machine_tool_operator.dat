40|$|A three {{jaw chuck}} set from a lathe machine tool failed whilst in use. At some prior {{point in time}} the {{case-hardened}} chuck jaw set had sustained damage to its gripping serrations, thus requiring refurbishment of the jaws. Shortly after re-entering service, the refurbished jaw number one (of three) failed traumatically. Sudden loss of grip allowed a large rapidly rotating work piece to be thrown free, hitting and inflicting seriously injury to the <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> <b>operator.</b> Analysis of the broken jaw revealed sub-surface case-cracking, initiated {{as a result of}} metallurgical changes induced by thermal processing undertaken as part of the refurbishment cycle. Fatigue propagation of a case-crack had then ensued, driving the crack to final traumatic failure. Further analysis revealed stress raising features on a second jaw. This particular jaw had initiated a longitudinal crack that, at the time of observation, had not propagated to failure. Therefore, both thermal processing and design shortcomings were found to be at issue with this incident. When considering the safety critical nature of lathe chuck jaws, a question to consider is whether a more prudent route of action is required for the future. Rather than attempting refurbishment, it would be reasonable simply to scrap worn jaws. This is considered a sensible course of future action, rather than running the risk of being overtaken by a similar failure. Finally, the issue of ineffective or non-existent machine tool guarding was considered, with the outcomes effectively reducing injury compensation awarded to the <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> <b>operator.</b> ...|$|E

These tool-wear maps are based a novel wear criterion developed here that relies on the % increase in motor (spindle and feed drive motors) RMS current values and is dubbed the Current Rise Index (CRI). For verification in a drilling operation application, this index is found to positively track the progressive increase in tool-wear. Utilizing this CRI and the associated polar plots, monitoring of cutting tools may be achieved simply by <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> <b>operator</b> via visual monitoring of polar CRI maps generated in real-time.

To assess how effective these controls have been, we have analyzed occupational mortality from scrotal cancer in England and Wales during 1979 - 80 and 1982 - 90.

Since there were no design information available, Chinese had to reverse-engineer the Soviet steam-powered Type 53 torpedo by taking apart two Soviet samples sold to China. Compounding the problem, the No. 50 Factory of the 705th Institute was only a small factory of 200 employees, and lacked both the necessary equipment and experts needed for the job. The 7th Academy made a top priority in 1963 to order <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> for the torpedo factory, while with the approvals of both the National Science and Technology Committee and the National Defense Science and Technology Committee, over two dozen experts including the best <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> <b>operators</b> were assigned to the torpedo factory from other areas including Nanjing.The propulsion system was the critical factor affecting the speed and the range of the torpedo. The Soviet Type 53 steam-powered torpedo was powered by a reciprocating engine and the cylinder of the engine had to sustain tremendous pressure. The only way to build cylinders that meet the requirement was to use a brand-new method to cast a newly developed copper alloy, which took the joint effort of a total of 40 enterprises with more than several dozen attempts until they were successful.

40|$|International audienceMachining {{large-scale}} {{parts in}} several industries (nuclear, naval, energy…) {{is a challenge}} for <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> <b>operators.</b> Various problems are encountered, like respecting specified dimensions, deformation of the workpiece during machining, limit of the cutting speed, excessive tool wear, etc. All these difficulties {{are related to the}} large size of the machined part, which may have several meters and weigh several hundred kilograms. This study focuses on analysis of the rough turning process of a shell component, having few meters, as a part of steam generators of nuclear power plants. During the rough turning step, a high material removal rate (moderate cutting speed, but high depth-of-cut and feed rate) is necessary to achieve the workpiece in reasonable time. Experimental and theoretical analyses are conducted to highlight the intense thermomechanical loading at the tool–workmaterial interface. Revealed physical phenomena at the tool rake face, like adhesion and abrasive wear types, using various characterization techniques, are reproduced by a numerical model developed to simulate the cutting process. As an interest result, contact discontinuities at the tool–chip interface as well as where the wear is highly localized are well predicted as observed on scanning electron microscope. These contact discontinuities are attributed to the grooved rake face of the insert, designed with a chip breaker to reduce the tool–chip contact area and to promote the chip fragmentation. This study can be helpful for the design of rough turning inserts, by analysing the effectiveness of the rake face geometry (contact area, chip breaker…) ...|$|R
