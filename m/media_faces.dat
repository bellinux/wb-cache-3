The study of social <b>media</b> <b>faces</b> similar challenges because new tools are developed at a rapid pace and existing tools are constantly being updated with new features, policies, and applications. Users tend to migrate, in often unpredictable ways, to new tools {{as well as to}} adopt multiple tools simultaneously, without showing consistent media preferences and habits (Quan-Haase, 2008). As a result, for scholars it sometimes feels as if the social media landscape changes too quickly to fully grasp and leaves scholars permanently lagging behind. We argue in this paper that beyond {{the ebb and flow of}} everyday events and seemingly idiosyncratic usage, trends exist underlying long-term trajectories, persistent social practices, and discernable cultural patterns...|$|E

40|$|Advertising {{on social}} <b>media</b> <b>faces</b> a new {{challenge}} as consumers can actively choose which advertisers to follow. Tracking company accounts, owned by 93 TV shows on the most popular tweeting website in China, provides evidence that firms advertise intensively, although doing so appears to drive followers away. An analytical model suggests that consumers with limited attention may rationally choose to unfollow a firm. This happens if consumers already {{know enough about the}} firm's quality and if the firm advertises too intensely. However, firms might still find intensive advertising the optimal strategy - if a firm is perceived as having a lesser quality offering, it wants to advertise aggressively to change consumers' beliefs about its quality; if a firm is perceived as having a higher quality offering, it also wants to advertise intensively, but in an effort to crowd-out advertising messages from its competitors. by Xinyu Cao.

40|$|There is {{considerable}} diversity within Vanuatu’s media landscape and reporting is not dominated by any political perspective. Commercial media frequently publishes corruption related stories, although reporting {{tends to be}} superficial. Media is also active in relaying government press releases, which serves {{to inform the public}} on governance issues and activities. However, <b>media</b> <b>faces</b> a number of challenges in being able to fulfil its “watchdog” role within the national integrity system. There are a limited number of qualified and experienced journalists. Intimidation of journalists occurs regularly. Cultural factors hinder the criticism of leaders. There is no freedom of information law. Licensing laws potentially allow for the Minister in charge to impose restrictive conditions on broadcast activities. All of these factors contribute to an environment which discourages investigative journalists. Internal governance is also weak. Whilst there is a voluntary code of media ethics there is no media regulatory body that can enforce ethical standards and practices. As a result {{there is no way to}} ensure that transparency, accountability and integrity mechanisms contained within this code affect media practices...|$|E
40|$|This article {{looks at}} three South Pacific Island nations—Fiji, Tonga and the Solomon Islands—in terms of some {{landmark}} changes occurring {{in their political}} arenas. Fiji, beset by racial and political problems culminating in three coups, is experimenting with a multiracial, multiparty cabinet that could be emulated by other multiethnic countries. Tonga, a Polynesian monarchy, has recently seen an unprecedented number of protest marches against the ruling elite, the death of its King, and is in experiencing palpable democratic changes. In the Solomons, the strong desire for a fairer political system was manifested in the 2006 riots in Honiara. It caught the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) napping and brought into question the sufficiency and focus of Australia’s intervention policy in the country. The media has been {{a key player in}} these events. Regularly accused of adding fuel to fire in its coverage of crises, the <b>media</b> <b>faces</b> constant government pressure in all three countries. This article argues that rather than the media, the sources of discontent and instability are self-serving leaders clinging to outdated political systems.

The rate at which awareness and cultural understanding regarding specific issues has not been quantified, but examining awareness about issues relevant to American Sign Language (ASL) and American Deaf culture indicates that progress in increasing awareness and cultural understanding via social <b>media</b> <b>faces</b> greater friction and less progress compared to issues relevant to other causes and communities, such as feminism, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community, or people of color.

The research itself is also examined in terms of who conducts the research. The few incidents of social media serving the Deaf community in a more positive manner are also examined. This is to provide contrast to determine which factors may contribute to greater progress in fostering greater awareness of Deaf cultural issues without the seemingly constant presence of resistance and lack of empathy for the Deaf community’s perspectives on ASL and Deaf culture...|$|E

Over the past few years, this industry has developed dramatically in China, and it is thriving. In terms of the current situation, the P 2 P streaming media industry holds typical Chinese features that both enrich the audience?s cultural life, and have some impact on other kinds of mass media. This paper analyzes the P 2 P streaming media industry in China in order to recommend solutions to the challenges faced by the industry. It introduces various technical terms related to P 2 P and describes the overall industrial situation of P 2 P streaming media in China. It utilizes Porter?s Five Forces model for an analysis of the entire industry and assesses key success factors (KSFs).

It {{is important to note that}} P 2 P streaming media does face various obstacles in its developmental stages, and it is developing, but this paper makes strategic recommendations for solutions to the challenges that P 2 P streaming <b>media</b> <b>faces...</b>|$|E
40|$|Democratic {{transition}} in Myanmar {{appears to have}} come to a standstill. Western analysts have focused on the political constraints faced by the National League for Democracy (NLD) under Aung San Suu Kyi. Most refer to the still-excessive power of the military to explain the party's governance failure. However, a closer look suggests that the NLD is not only unable but is also unwilling to lead according to democratic principles. Since its re-establishment as a political party in 2011, the NLD has mobilized voters by propagating liberty, equality, and justice - thus fanning the hopes of those longing for an end to authoritarian state policies. Now, over a year after its landslide victory, these hopes are beginning to crumble as the NLD fails {{to live up to its}} convictions. Ethnic minorities have criticised the lack of progress in ensuring their rights in the face of military operations in the north-east and the west of the country. Human rights advocates have condemned Aung San Suu Kyi's passivity towards the military's persecution of the Rohingya minority in Rakhine State and the NLD's downplaying of the conflict. The <b>media</b> <b>faces</b> increasing intimidation instead of enjoying freedom of speech, while state media channels continue to produce old-style propaganda. NLD members are worried about the decline of democratic decision-making within the party. They are demanding a more transparent and efficient chain of communication to address urgent concerns and deeper integration of junior party members. The NLD's tacit approval of the military's actions and its increased disconnection from the democratic values on which it was elected have raised concerns over the party's will to continue along its chosen path. To support Myanmar's transition, European decision-makers need to strengthen their relations with the Myanmar government and press for policies that support transparency, accountability, and the protection of human rights. To be successful, policymakers should employ an approach that combines economic cooperation incentives and careful diplomatic counsel...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{applications}} of nanoparticles (NP) increasingly result in widespread NP distribution within porous media {{where they are}} subject to various concurrent transport mechanisms including irreversible deposition, attachment/detachment (equilibrium or kinetic), agglomeration, physical straining, site-blocking, ripening, and size exclusion. Fundamental research in NP transport is typically conducted at small scale, and theoretical mechanistic modeling of particle transport in porous <b>media</b> <b>faces</b> challenges when considering the simultaneous effects of transport mechanisms. Continuum modeling approaches, in contrast, are scalable across various scales ranging from column experiments to aquifer. They have also been able to successfully describe the simultaneous occurrence of various transport mechanisms of NP in porous media such as blocking/straining or agglomeration/deposition/detachment. However, the diversity of model equations developed by different authors and the lack of effective approaches for their validation present obstacles to the successful robust application of these models for describing or predicting NP transport phenomena. This review aims to describe consistently all the important NP transport mechanisms along with their representative mathematical continuum models as found in the current scientific literature. Detailed characterizations of each transport phenomenon in regards to their manifestation in the column experiment outcomes, i. e., breakthrough curve (BTC) and residual concentration profile (RCP), are presented to facilitate future interpretations of BTCs and RCPs. The review highlights two NP transport mechanisms, agglomeration and size exclusion, which are potentially of great importance in controlling the fate and transport of NP in the subsurface media yet have been widely neglected in many existing modeling studies. A critical limitation of the continuum modeling approach is the number of parameters used upon application to larger scales and when a series of transport mechanisms are involved. We investigate the use of simplifying assumptions, such as the equilibrium assumption, in modeling the attachment/detachment mechanisms within a continuum modelling framework. While acknowledging criticisms about the use of this assumption for NP deposition on a mechanistic (process) basis, we found that its use as a description of dynamic deposition behavior in a continuum model yields broadly similar results to those arising from a kinetic model. Furthermore, we show that in two dimensional (2 -D) continuum models the modeling efficiency based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) is enhanced for equilibrium vs kinetic with no significant reduction in model performance. This is because fewer parameters are needed for the equilibrium model compared to the kinetic model. Two major transport regimes are identified in the transport of NP within porous media. The first regime is characterized by higher particle-surface attachment affinity than particle-particle attachment affinity, and operative transport mechanisms of physicochemical filtration, blocking, and physical retention. The second regime is characterized by the domination of particle-particle attachment tendency over particle-surface affinity. In this regime although physicochemical filtration as well as straining may still be operative, ripening is predominant together with agglomeration and further subsequent retention. In both regimes careful assessment of NP fate and transport is necessary since certain combinations of concurrent transport phenomena leading to large migration distances are possible in either case...|$|E
