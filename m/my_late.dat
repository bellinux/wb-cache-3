Her marriage, from betrothal to widowhood, is {{described}} in just nine lines {{at the conclusion of}} the first chapter of her autobiography. His middle names are notable: Robinson reports the legend in the Seacole family that Edwin was an illegitimate son of Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson and his mistress Emma, Lady Hamilton, who was adopted by Thomas, a local [...] "surgeon, apothecary and man midwife" [...] (Seacole's will indicates that Horatio Seacole was Nelson's [...] she left a diamond ring to her friend, Lord Rokeby, [...] "given to <b>my</b> <b>late</b> husband by his godfather Viscount Nelson", but there was no mention of this godson in Nelson's own will or its [...] codicils.) [...] Edwin was a merchant and seems to have had a poor constitution. The newly married couple moved to Black River and opened a provisions store which failed to prosper. They returned to Blundell Hall in the early 1840s.|$|E
500|$|His {{father died}} in June 1912, which, {{according}} to Șerban Cioculescu (who cited Mateiu's correspondence), left him indifferent. By then, Caragiale-son resented Ion Luca's alleged exploitation of his popularity for material gains, and, later in the same year, commented that, [...] "for a small fee", Caragiale-father could be persuaded to read his works at the fair in Obor. In a since-lost piece of his diary that was commented upon by Cioculescu, he also claimed that binge drinking and tobacco abuse had made his father decay physically and mentally. Despite his love for Berlin, he was also dissatisfied with his father's move to the city, and spread the rumor that, {{in the eyes of}} his family and friends, Ion Luca's departure was interpreted as [...] "insane" [...] (while alleging that Caragiale-father was planning to author plays in German, with assistance from Mite Kremnitz, the one-time lover of poet Mihai Eminescu). At the funeral ceremony, he reputedly shocked pianist Cella Delavrancea by coldly stating in French: Je suis venu voir feu mon père ("I came to see <b>my</b> <b>late</b> father").|$|E

[...] Scully's decision echoed that of Myron Cope, who had retired after the 2004 season as the Pittsburgh Steelers color commentator, only to see the team advance to Super Bowl XL the following season and an unsuccessful fan petition to have Cope call that game. Scully did, however, take part in the first pitch ceremony prior to Game 2 with Steve Yeager and Fernando Valenzuela, teammates on the Dodgers team that won the 1981 World Series.|$|E
2500|$|..... <b>My</b> <b>late</b> {{father was}} a seaman with the Wexford Steamship Company. He served the nation, like so many young men, through {{dangerous}} times in the war years. In every sense {{he and his colleagues}} put {{their lives on the line}} day after day, in ships which today would not be licensed to go on the high seas, to bring supplies to this nation. Many of his colleagues and friends and many people from Wexford and around the coast paid the ultimate price in serving this nation by losing their lives. The ships were so rickety, old and derelict that we would not go to sea in them today. Yet, these brave, perhaps foolhardy, men crossed the Atlantic, went to the Mediterranean and North African coast and kept Ireland supplied with vital provisions. My father's ship, the Kerlogue, was involved in one of the great rescues of the war. One of the proudest possessions I have is a decoration awarded to him and other members of the crew for rescuing German sailors in the Bay of Biscay in December 1943, when they hauled hundreds of young men from the water .....

2500|$|In a 2006 interview, Cornell {{revealed}} {{that at the}} age of 14, he had a bad PCP experience and suffered from panic disorder and agoraphobia. [...] "I had a bad PCP [...] experience when I was 14 and I got panic disorder. And of course, I wasn't telling anyone the truth. It's not like you go to your dad or your doctor and say, 'Yeah, I smoked PCP and I'm having a bad time.' So I became more or less agoraphobic because I'd have flashbacks. From 14 to 16, I didn't have any friends. I stayed home most of the time. Up till then life was pretty great. The world was big and I felt I could do anything I wanted. Suddenly, I felt like I couldn't do anything. But in the isolation, my imagination really had time to run. I never did any drugs until <b>my</b> <b>late</b> 20s. Unfortunately, being a child of two alcoholics, I started drinking a lot, and that's what eventually got me back into drugs. You often hear that pot leads to harder drugs. But I think alcohol is what leads you to everything, because it takes away the fear. The worst drug experimentation I ever did was because I was drunk and didn't care." ...|$|E

2500|$|More {{far-reaching}} was the Kantakouzenos' {{involvement in}} promoting the career of Michael the Brave, who had served as Ban of Oltenia. Possibly appointed to this office by Iane himself, in or around 1590, Michael was in open conflict with Prince Alexander the Wicked after 1593, and, according to legend, miraculously escaped execution. The Kantakouzenos, and especially Andronikos, were instrumental in obtaining him the Wallachian throne. This includes collecting 400,000 ducats (45 million USD in 1995) from the various creditors of Istanbul, a loan which Michael had paid up in September 1593. One of Andronikos' letters to a Moldavian favorite, Peter the Lame, states that the Kantakouzenos viewed Michael as the only viable candidate [...] "of all those other sinners [...] cunning beys". Kantakouzenos also takes pride in noting that Wallachians [...] "thanked God" [...] and [...] "blessed <b>my</b> <b>late</b> parents" [...] for his selection of [...] "such a good shepherd, such a good Christian" [...] as Michael. According to Iorga, the sponsor implicitly scolded Peter, but still kept him as his reserve option for the Moldavian throne against Aaron. As Vergatti notes, such musings also indicate that Andronikos expected a high return on his original investment, and was already expecting Michael to reappoint him as Vistier.|$|E
