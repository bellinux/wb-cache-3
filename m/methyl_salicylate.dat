5|$|Aspirin {{overdose}} can be acute or chronic. In acute poisoning, {{a single}} large dose is taken; in chronic poisoning, {{higher than normal}} doses are taken {{over a period of}} time. Acute overdose has a mortality rate of 2%. Chronic overdose is more commonly lethal, with a mortality rate of 25%; chronic overdose may be especially severe in children. Toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments, including activated charcoal, intravenous dextrose and normal saline, sodium bicarbonate, and dialysis. The diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate, the active metabolite of aspirin, by automated spectrophotometric methods. Plasma salicylate levels in general range from 30–100mg/l after usual therapeutic doses, 50–300mg/l in people taking high doses and 700–1400mg/l following acute overdose. Salicylate is also produced as a result of exposure to bismuth subsalicylate, <b>methyl</b> <b>salicylate,</b> and sodium salicylate.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPlant defensins, {{formerly}} named γ-thionins, are a {{group of}} small, cysteine-rich, basic, and antimicrobial plant proteins. Random sequencing of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in Arabidopsis thaliana has revealed several different plant defensin genes in this plant species which can be grouped into two subfamilies. We have used one EST of each subfamily to study {{the expression of the}} corresponding genes in A. thaliana. Pdf 2. 3 is constitutively expressed in seedlings, rosettes, flowers, and siliques and is not inducible in seedlings either by <b>methyl</b> jasmonate, <b>salicylate,</b> ethephon, and silver nitrate or by several different phytopathogenic fungi. The expression of a second gene, Pdf 1. 2, is in untreated plants only detectable in rosettes. In seedlings, it is inducible by methyl jasmonate, silver nitrate, and different phytopathogenic fungi, notably Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. matthiolae.

40|$|A 5 -kbp region {{upstream}} of the are-ben-cat genes was cloned from Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP 1, {{extending the}} supraoperonic cluster of catabolic genes to 30 kbp. Four open reading frames, salA, salR, salE, and salD, were identified from the nucleotide sequence. Reverse transcription-PCR studies suggested that these open reading frames are organized into two convergent transcription units, salAR and salDE. The salE gene, encoding a protein of 239 residues, was ligated into expression vector pET 5 a. Its product, SalE, {{was shown to}} have esterase activity against short-chain alkyl esters of 4 -nitrophenol but was also able to hydrolyze ethyl salicylate to ethanol and salicylic acid. A mutant of ADP 1 with a Kmr cassette introduced into salE had {{lost the ability to}} utilize only ethyl and <b>methyl</b> <b>salicylates</b> of the esters tested as sole carbon sources, and no esterase activity against ethyl salicylate could be detected in cell extracts. SalE was induced during growth on ethyl salicylate but not during growth on salicylate itself. salD encoded a protein of undetermined function with homologies to the Escherichia coli FadL membrane protein, which is involved in facilitating fatty acid transport, {{and a number of other}} proteins detected during aromatic catabolism, which may also function in hydrocarbon transport or uptake processes. A Kmr cassette insertion in salD deleteriously affected cell growth and viability. The salA and salR gene products closely resemble two Pseudomonas proteins, NahG and NahR, respectively encoding salicylate hydroxylase and the LysR family regulator of both salicylate and naphthalene catabolism. salA was cloned into pUC 18 together with salR and salE, and its gene product showed salicylate-inducible hydroxylase activity against a range of substituted salicylates, with the same relative specific activities as found in wild-type ADP 1 grown on salicylate. Mutations involving insertion of Kmr cassettes into salA and salR eliminated expression of salicylate hydroxylase activity and the ability to grow on either salicylate or ethyl salicylate. Studies of mutants with disruptions of genes of the β-ketoadipate pathway with or without an additional salE mutation confirmed that ethyl salicylate and salicylate were channeled into the β-ketoadipate pathway at the level of catechol and thence dissimilated by the cat gene products. SalR appeared to regulate expression of salA but not salE...|$|R

The essential oil obtained from leaves of Eucalyptus globulus and from seeds of Trachyspermum ammi by Clevenger apparatus. Chemical composition of the essential oils of E. globulus and T. ammi was analyzed by Gas chromatography – Mass spectrometry. Four main compounds in E. globulus were identified as Eucalyptol, <b>Methyl</b> – <b>salicylate,</b> Thymol, Para- cymene. 1, 8 -cineole {{was found to be}} the main compound of E. globulus essential oil. Thymol, gamma-terpinene, para- cymene, beta- pinene were the main compounds of T. ammi oil and traces amount of beta myrcene, alpha- thujne, alpha-pinene, alpha- terpinene, carvacrol compounds of T. ammi were identified by GC-MS.

25|$|Chemical Bait Study: A census {{study in}} Costa Rica {{including}} E. imperialis, shows that males {{of this species}} are attracted primarily to cineole, followed by <b>methyl</b> <b>salicylate</b> and methyl cinnamate. What this study was able to show, {{is that there is}} some degree representative of seasonal fluctuation of pollinators, which is slightly more intense in deciduous forest habitats than in rain forest habitats. However, when there is strong inter-habitat heterogeneity, such as is with the ability of euglossine bees to pollinate flowering orchid plants, a low percentage of pollen-laden bees could result.|$|E
25|$|Resource 'Hot Spots: As plants {{bloom and}} die, {{resource}} ‘hot spots’ for chemical fragrances wax and wane throughout the year. This means that temporal changes, especially between seasons, shift euglossine bee preferences for certain chemical fragrances over others. For E. imperialis, {{there is a}} marginally significant trend (P = 0.07) in chemical preference, which largely deals with preferring the chemical cineole during later times in the year as opposed to <b>methyl</b> <b>salicylate.</b> Another factor which may change fragrance preference in the local fragrance environment for euglossine bees is {{a shift in the}} wind direction, which may cause another fragrance ‘hot spot’ {{to be included in the}} odor plume.|$|E

40|$|The {{intention}} {{of this study}} was to extract and characterise phytochemicals with analgesic effect from Kirkia Acuminata bark extracts. Soxhlet extraction and Steam distillation were used for the extraction of compounds. Methanol,dichloromethane and hexane were used as solvents. Classes of phytochemicals were identified by qualitative tests and Thin Layer Chromatography using UV light. The qualitative tests of the phytochemical screening indicated the presence of alkaloids, anthraquinones, glycosides, flavonoids, phenols, tannins to name a few. Alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols and tannins were also observed on Thin Layer Chromatography. Menthol, catechol, 1, 2 benzenediol 4 <b>methyl,</b> nitro phenyl <b>salicylate,</b> phenol dimethoxy,tau-cadinol,Isopropenyl, 8 dimethyl, menthone and levomenthone were identified using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer [...] The hexane fraction which is highly a non-polar solvent showed that very few phytochemicals were taken up in it.

40|$|The {{effects of}} sodium {{salicylate}} and of aspirin on {{the actions of}} pancreatic, salivary and serum kallikreins have been investigated. Kinin production by the three enzymes was assessed using a guinea-pig isolated ileum preparation. The esterolytic activity of pancreatic and salivary kallikreins was measured by determining acid release from the synthetic substrate toluene-p-sulphonyl-L-arginine <b>methyl</b> ester. Sodium <b>salicylate</b> (up to 20 mM) or aspirin (up to 5 mM) failed to inhibit kinin production by {{each of the three}} enzymes. With salivary kallikrein, a concentration of 50 mM of sodium salicylate was required to produce a 50 % inhibition of kinin production. No significant inhibition of esterolytic activity was produced by concentrations up to 5 mM of either sodium salicylate or aspirin. Prior incubation of sodium salcylate or aspirin with the enzymes also resulted in no significant effect of either drug on kinin production or esterolytic activity. Prior incubation of pancreatic or salivary kallikrein with the inhibitor from ox parotid gland (Trasylol) reduced both kinin production and esterolytic activity. Toluene-p-sulphonyl-L-arginine methyl ester (0. 5 mM) inhibited kinin production by each of the three enzymes. It is concluded that sodium salicylate and aspirin are poor inhibitors of kallikrein activity in vitro...|$|R
25|$|Salicylic acid (SA) is a {{phenolic}} phytohormone and {{is found}} in plants with roles in plant growth and development, photosynthesis, transpiration, ion uptake and transport. SA also induces specific changes in leaf anatomy and chloroplast structure. SA is involved in endogenous signaling, mediating in plant defense against pathogens. It {{plays a role in}} the resistance to pathogens by inducing the production of pathogenesis-related proteins. It is involved in the systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in which a pathogenic attack on one part of the plant induces resistance in other parts. The signal can also move to nearby plants by salicylic acid being converted to the volatile ester, <b>methyl</b> <b>salicylate.</b>|$|E

40|$|Capsaicinoids, {{salicylic}} acid, <b>methyl</b> and ethyl <b>salicylate,</b> glycol monosalicylate, camphor and l-menthol {{are widely}} used in topical formulations to relieve local pain. For each separate compound or simple mixtures, quantitative analysis methods are reported. However, for a mixture containing all above mentioned active compounds, no assay methods were found. Due to the differing physicochemical characteristics, two methods were developed and optimized simultaneously. The non-volatile capsaicinoids, salicylic acid and glycol monosalicylate were analyzed with liquid chromatography following liquid-liquid extraction, whereas the volatile compounds were analyzed with static headspace-gas chromatography. For the latter method, liquid paraffin was selected as compatible dilution solvent. The optimized methods were validated in terms of specificity, linearity, accuracy and precision {{in a range of}} 80 % to 120 % of the expected concentrations. For both methods, peaks were well separated without interference of other compounds. Linear relationships were demonstrated with R(2) values higher than 0. 996 for all compounds. Accuracy was assessed by performing replicate recovery experiments with spiked blank samples. Mean recovery values were all between 98 % and 102 %. Precision was checked at three levels: system repeatability, method precision and intermediate precision. Both methods were found to be acceptably precise at all three levels. Finally, the method was successfully applied to the analysis of some real samples (cutaneous sticks). status: publishe...|$|R
