5000|$|During {{his years}} in Vienna Adolph von Morlot {{performed}} a series of experiments (most probably {{at the request of}} Wilhelm Haidinger) to try and synthesize the mineral dolomite. Von Morlot (1847 A) started out his first paper on dolomite synthesis with stating, that Giovanni Arduino (1779) [...] had been the first scientist to suggest the (high-temperature) conversion of limestone into dolomite. The chemical process would consist of a high-temperature reaction between limestone and magnesium. Furthermore, Von Morlot (1847 A) expressed his astonishment over the fact, that Arduino had ventured to postulate this far-reaching chemical process for the formation of dolomite merely on the basis of field observations only. At the same time Von Morlot mentioned the (field) observations made by Leopold von Buch (1824), who had found fossils in what once must have been limestone, but that now consisted of dolomite. From which it had been concluded, that some large-scale process must have changed limestone into dolomite. Von Buch (1824) had invoked [...] "magnesia vapours" [...] to explain the transition, but Von Morlot thought such a process unlikely, because it must have taken place at extremely high temperatures, which should have left other tell-tale changes in the limestone and the dolomite. At this point Adolph von Morlot introduced the view of Wilhelm Haidinger, who while writing on pseudomorphosis, had suggested that the change of limestone into dolomite would have taken place through the reaction of a solution of magnesium sulphate with the calcium carbonate of the limestone. The reaction products would be the double carbonate of calcium and magnesium (= dolomite) and a solution of calcium sulphate. After explaining the reaction, Von Morlot reminded his readers, that in chemistry only the reverse reactions was known (Note 5). Citing from Haidinger's own paper (1844) [...] Von Morlot repeated the observation made by three well-known chemists of that time Friedrich Wöhler, Eilhardt Mitscherlich and Leopold Gmelin, that powdered dolomite reacts with a solution of calcium sulphate in water to give calcium carbonate powder in a solution of magnesium sulphate. Wilhelm Haidinger had admitted to Von Morlot (Note 6), that this must be the reaction that really takes place at room temperature (of around 25 °C), {{but at the same time}} he had suggested to Von Morlot that the change from calcium carbonate into dolomite would take place in the deeper realms of the earth, that is to say at elevated temperatures and under high pressure.All that was needed to prove the theory of Haidinger were a few laboratory experiments, as Von Morlot (1847 A) put it. The outlines of such experiments had been discussed between Wilhelm Haidinger and Friedrich Wöhler in 1843, and although Wöhler had started some experiments, he could not finish these because of his departure to Graz. As Von Morlot related, he himself took over the experiments of Wöhler in the winter of 1846. The various experiments were all conducted in a laboratory of the [...] "k.k. Hofkammer im Münz- und Bergwesen" [...] (Note 7).The laboratory syntheses of dolomite by Von Morlot involved finely powdered, pure calcite crystals mixed with a quantity of <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>heptahydrate.</b> The mixture was enclosed in a rather thick glass tube, which was closed by melting its open end. The glass tube was heated in an oil bath to a temperature of 200° Reamur (= 250° Celsius). The high pressure developing inside the glass tube was prevented from blowing it up through fitting it in a (steel) gun barrel filled up with fine sand. Von Morlot obtained only indirect evidence, that in these experiments dolomite had been formed; the mineral as such could not be isolated and identified. But the transition of the magnesium sulphate that had been present at the start of the experiment, into calcium sulphate indicated a fundamental change had taken place. Von Morlot (1847 A) claimed that 232 milligram of dolomite must have been formed, but his conclusion was based only on calculations and not only actual measurement.Only later, in a second paper published in 1847, Von Morlot could claim real success in synthesizing the mineral dolomite in the laboratory. After applying the rather simple method of adding dilute hydrochloric acid to distinguish between calcium carbonate and dolomite to the powder obtained in his high-temperature / high-pressure experiments, Von Morlot (1847 B) noted that not all of the precipitate would dissolve. Therefore, Von Morlot, somewhat hesitantly, suggested that dolomite had formed in his experiments. His doubt was not shared by Wilhelm Haidinger, who added as the last words to Von Morlot's paper (once more published in Haidinger's own [...] "Berichte über die Mittheilungen von Freunden der Naturwissenschaften in Wien"), that there was no need at all for doubt: these experiments had clearly brought an answer through hard work in the laboratory.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} pH and some {{nutrients}} starvation on biodegradation of azo dyes (Orange II and Direct Blue 71) by Pseudomonas sp. was investigated. Highest percentage decolourization values of 56. 50 % and 45. 20 % were obtained at pH 7. 0 and 6. 5 for Orange II and Direct Blue 71 respectively. Rate of decolourization decreased with increasing concentration of nitrate (sodium nitrate) or sulphate (<b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>heptahydrate).</b> Highest percentage decolourization (79. 29 % for Orange II and 72. 38 % for Direct Blue 71) was obtained in positive controls (no nitrate added). Corresponding values for sulphate-limited conditions were 76. 50 % for Orange II and 78. 24 % for Direct Blue 71 in positive controls (no sulphate added). The nitrogen of the generated aromatic amines provided the sole source of nitrogen in positive controls. Desulphonation of the aromatic moiety provided the sole source of sulphur in the positive control medium. The {{study shows that}} detoxification of ecosystems contaminated with azo dyes are enhanced under nitrate and sulphate-limited conditions...|$|E

Because of insufficient data, the FEEDAP Panel {{is not in a}} position to derive a maximum safe iron concentration in feed for horses or fish; as a provisional measure, the current value (750 mg/kg) could be maintained. The values for total dietary iron for pigs, ovines, horses, fish and other species/categories (except poultry, bovines and pets) are in line with those currently authorised. Iron from ferrous <b>sulphate</b> <b>heptahydrate</b> is unlikely to modify the iron concentration in edible tissues and products of animal origin. Consumer exposure in the EU is not associated with a risk of excess iron intake to the general population. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel does not foresee any concern for consumer safety resulting from the use of ferrous <b>sulphate</b> <b>heptahydrate</b> in animal nutrition, provided that the maximum iron content in complete feedingstuffs is respected. Ferrous <b>sulphate</b> <b>heptahydrate</b> is an irritant and corrosive to the skin, eyes and respiratory tract; thus, handling of the additive poses a hazard to the user/worker.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to optimize the laccase production from bacteria using different nutrition sources. The laccase producer, identified as Klebsiella sp. was selected for the optimization of laccase production with particular attention to the effect of nutrition factors on laccase production using submerged culture technique. Laccase was characterized to assist in formulating the best condition for the bioconversion of lignin. This approach enables to optimize number of nutritional factor and calculate their interaction and combination of nutrition in the laccase production. Five nutrition sources selected were carbon sources, nitrogen organic sources, inorganic nitrogen, amino acid and metal ions. The other physical factor was maintained constant such as pH, temperature, inoculums size and incubation time. The best culture condition obtained consisted of beef extract (1. 0 g), ammonium chloride (0. 1 g), di-potassium phosphate (0. 05 g), <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>heptahydrate</b> (0. 03 g), magnesium chloride (0. 1 g), Sodium Chloride (0. 1 g), and starch (1. 0 g). Under the above culture conditions, the time of fermentation carried out was 24 hours with maximum laccase activity of 9. 099 x 10 ‐⁶ (U/ml). The characterization study of concentrated laccase revealed the importance of an acidic condition for the highest laccase activity. ...|$|E

40|$|Extent: 9 p. BACKGROUND: Magnesium {{sulphate}} {{is currently}} recommended for neuroprotection of preterm infants for women {{at risk of}} preterm birth at less than 30 weeks’ gestation, based on high quality evidence of benefit. However there remains uncertainty as to whether these benefits apply at higher gestational ages. The aim of this randomised controlled trial is to assess whether giving magnesium sulphate compared with placebo to women immediately prior to preterm birth between 30 and 34 weeks’ gestation {{reduces the risk of}} death or cerebral palsy in their children at two years’ corrected age. METHODS/DESIGN: DESIGN: Randomised, multicentre, placebo controlled trial. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Women, giving informed consent, at risk of preterm birth between 30 to 34 weeks’ gestation, where birth is planned or definitely expected within 24 hours, with a singleton or twin pregnancy and no contraindications to the use of magnesium sulphate. TRIAL ENTRY & RANDOMISATION: Eligible women will be randomly allocated to receive either magnesium sulphate or placebo. TREATMENT GROUPS: Women in the magnesium sulphate group will be administered 50 ml of a 100 ml infusion bag containing 8 g <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>heptahydrate</b> [16 mmol magnesium ions]. Women in the placebo group will be administered 50 ml of a 100 ml infusion bag containing isotonic sodium chloride solution (0. 9 %). Both treatments will be administered through a dedicated IV infusion line over 30 minutes. PRIMARY STUDY OUTCOME: Death or cerebral palsy measured in children at two years’ corrected age. SAMPLE SIZE: 1676 children are required to detect a decrease in the combined outcome of death or cerebral palsy, from 9. 6 % with placebo to 5. 4 % with magnesium sulphate (two-sided alpha 0. 05, 80 % power, 5 % loss to follow up, design effect 1. 2). DISCUSSION: Given the magnitude of the protective effect in the systematic review, the ongoing uncertainty about benefits at later gestational ages, the serious health and cost consequences of cerebral palsy for the child, family and society, a trial of magnesium sulphate for women at risk of preterm birth between 30 to 34 weeks’ gestation is both important and relevant for clinical practice globally.

40|$|Background: Eclampsia is a {{hypertensive}} disorder related to pregnancy, {{in which there}} is occurrence of one or more generalized convulsions and or coma, in the absence of other neurologic conditions. It is a common obstetric emergency. Eclampsia is associated with elevated maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Objectives : To compare the efficacy of low dose <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> (Dhaka) regime with Pritchard regime in Eclampsia. Material and Methods : A prospective randomized study of fifty eclampsia cases, treated with <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> (25 each from low dose <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> (Dhaka) regime and Pritchard regime) was carried out for one year i. e. January 2010 to December 2010 at Pravara Rural Hospital, Loni. Results were analysed using Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) 13. 0. Results: In the present study, convulsions were controlled in 88 % of eclampsia cases with low dose <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> (Dhaka) regime. Two cases i. e. 8 % had single episode of recurrence of convulsion, which was controlled by giving additional 2 grams of 20 % <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> intravenous single dose.

40|$|Background: <b>Magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> is {{a high-risk}} {{medication}} {{that is used}} extensively for prophylaxis and treatment of eclampsia. To accommodate recommendations related to fluid restrictions and patient safety, a protocol was developed for the administration of 20 % <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate.</b> Objectives: To determine whether administration of 20 % <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> increased the risk of phlebitis relative to 2 % to 8 % <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> solutions, {{to determine if the}} institution’s protocol for administration of 20 % <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> reduced errors during administration, and to identify strategies to further reduce potential errors. Methods: A retrospective chart audit was undertaken for patients who had received <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> for prophylaxis of eclampsia from December 2004 to December 2007. A failure mode and effect analysis was used to identify additional safety strategies. Results: A total of 47 patients received <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> according to the old administration protocol (2 % to 8 % solution) and 29 according to the new protocol (20 % solution). No evidence of phlebitis was documented for any of these 76 patients. A few errors occurred with changes in rates or concentrations and because of failure to reset the pump after the loading dose, but there was no documented harm to any of the patients. Strategies to further reduce errors in the administration of <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> included development of preprinted orders, use of 20 % <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> for all infusion rates, changes to pump settings to enable use of fractional infusion rates, preparation of <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> in mini-bags in the pharmacy, double-check of pump settings by nurses, anesthesiology consult, and distribution of protocols to all areas in the hospital (to limit errors associated with patient transfers).

40|$|Lipolytic fungi we {{isolated}} from the soil and food samples using a selective isolation medium. The isolated fungal cultures were screened for found to produce maximum lipase. The fungus Rhizopus arrhizus (isolate: 52) was found to produce maximum lipase. The fermentation medium M 5, consisting of (g/dm 3) :- olive oil, 20; yeast extract 1. 0; <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>heptahydrate</b> 0. 25; calcium carbonate, 5. 0 {{was found to be}} the best medium for lipase formation by Rhizopus arrhizus. The cultural conditions like medium composition, pH, aeration rate and incubation temperature were optimized for the production of the intracellular lipase by Rhizopus arrhizus in sake flasks. The optimization of the fermentation conditions resulted in about three fold increase in the production of lipases. This optimized medium gave 13. 5 g/dm 3 fungal biomass with 325 lipase units/g dry mycelium and bout 2. 4 units extracellular lipase per cm 3 of the broth. The fermentation was also carried out in 18 dm 3 stirred fermenter and 4 dm 3 airlift production. The airlift fermenter was found to be especially suitable for the intracellular lipase production. In it, the fungus Rhizopus arrhizus produced 375 units lipase per gram mycelium and 14. 2 g mycelium per dm 3 medium. In stirred fermenter,, however, both fungal biomass and intracellular lipase activity were comparatively low. Rhizopus arrhizus was also cultured in solid substrate fro extracellular lipase production. Different agricultural by products such as wheat bran, gram bran, rice husk, soybean meal and rice bran were evaluated for lipase production. A mixture of wheat bran and soybean meal, however, was found to be the best substrate. Additives like olive oil and the egg yolk emulsion increased lipase production. The extracellular and intracellular lipase of the mould Rhizopus arrhizus were used for the biocatalysis of esterification reactions. Free excellular lipase showed very low esterification activity (28 esterification units/g) whereas the celite immobilized lipase catalyzed synthesis of hexyl octanoate at the rate of 51 micromoloe/min/gram. Mycelial lipase of Rhizopus arrhizus, however, was very active in organic media and performed the synthetic work efficiently. In n-hexane, at 30 oC the mycelial lipase of Rhizopus arrhizus Catalyzed the synthesis of hexyl octanoate at a rate of 92 micromoles/min/gram mycelium. The mycelial lipase of Rhizopus arrhizus was also used for the production of fragrant esters from the fusel oil and terpene alcohols.

40|$|Crystallization is a {{purification}} {{method used}} to obtain crystalline product of a certain crystal size. It {{is one of the}} oldest industrial unit processes and commonly used in modern industry due to its good purification capability from rather impure solutions with reasonably low energy consumption. However, the process is extremely challenging to model and control because it involves inhomogeneous mixing and many simultaneous phenomena such as nucleation, crystal growth and agglomeration. All these phenomena are dependent on supersaturation, i. e. the difference between actual liquid phase concentration and solubility. Homogeneous mass and heat transfer in the crystallizer would greatly simplify modelling and control of crystallization processes, such conditions are, however, not the reality, especially in industrial scale processes. Consequently, the hydrodynamics of crystallizers, i. e. the combination of mixing, feed and product removal flows, and recycling of the suspension, needs to be thoroughly investigated. Understanding of hydrodynamics is important in crystallization, especially inlargerscale equipment where uniform flow conditions are difficult to attain. It is also important to understand different size scales of mixing; micro-, meso- and macromixing. Fast processes, like nucleation and chemical reactions, are typically highly dependent on micro- and mesomixing but macromixing, which equalizes the concentrations of all the species within the entire crystallizer, cannot be disregarded. This study investigates the influence of hydrodynamics on crystallization processes. Modelling of crystallizers with the mixed suspension mixed product removal (MSMPR) theory (ideal mixing), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and a compartmental multiblock model is compared. The importance of proper verification of CFD and multiblock models is demonstrated. In addition, the influence of different hydrodynamic conditions on reactive crystallization process control is studied. Finally, the effect of extreme local supersaturation is studied using power ultrasound to initiate nucleation. The present work shows that mixing and chemical feeding conditions clearly affect induction time and cluster formation, nucleation, growth kinetics, and agglomeration. Consequently, the properties of crystalline end products, e. g. crystal size and crystal habit, can be influenced by management of mixing and feeding conditions. Impurities may have varying impacts on crystallization processes. As an example, manganese ions were shown to replace magnesium ions in the crystal lattice of <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>heptahydrate,</b> increasing the crystal growth rate significantly, whereas sodium ions showed no interaction at all. Modelling of continuous crystallization based on MSMPR theory showed that the model is feasible in a small laboratoryscale crystallizer, whereas in larger pilot- and industrial-scale crystallizers hydrodynamic effects should be taken into account. For that reason, CFD and multiblock modelling are shown to be effective tools for modelling crystallization with inhomogeneous mixing. The present work shows also that selection of the measurement point, or points in the case of multiprobe systems, is crucial when process analytical technology (PAT) is used to control larger scale crystallization. The thesis concludes by describing how control of local supersaturation by highly localized ultrasound was successfully applied to induce nucleation and to control polymorphism in reactive crystallization of L-glutamic acid...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{establish}} whether secondary nucleation mechanisms proposed for the crystallization of non-protein materials are shared with protein crystallization. In addition, the density of crystals for non-protein materials influences their secondary nucleation behaviour. The density of a protein crystal is interesting in that it varies with {{the density of the}} liquid in which it is suspended or stored. Similarly, the density of protein crystals may change with crystal drying in air, an important consideration for post-crystallization handling and storage of protein crystals. The effect of crystal drying on protein crystal density is investigated briefly in this thesis. The propensity of protein crystals to generate potential secondary nuclei by attrition is characterized from crystal mechanical properties measured by indentation. A fracture toughness value of a protein crystal (tetragonal hen egg white lysozyme) is measured {{for the first time and}} is found to be 1. 6 x 10 - 3 MPa m 1 / 2. This value is two orders of magnitude lower than the measured values for potassium sulphate (165 x 10 - 3 MPa m 1 / 2) and glutamic acid crystals (68 x 10 - 3 MPa m 1 / 2). This observation indicates that lysozyme is much more fragile than the two non-protein materials. Lysozyme crystals have an indentation hardness value of 15 MPa. This value is two orders of magnitude lower than the measured hardness for glutamic acid (2158 MPa) and the literature hardness for potassium sulphate. This observation indicates that lysozyme is most prone to deform plastically. Lysozyme and potassium sulphate have similar brittleness indices (hardness/fracture toughness), which indicates that these two materials have a similar tendency to deform plastically rather than fracture. The available literature shows that potassium sulphate crystals undergo attrition from collisions in stirred suspensions. Thus, it is expected that lysozyme would behave similarly, but would attrite at a greater rate due to its much lower fracture toughness and hardness. The density of part-dried protein crystals (hen egg white lysozyme) are measured for the first time and are observed to change by as much as 15 % from a wet crystal (1. 17 g/mL) to a dry one (1. 39 g/ml). The moisture content of lysozyme crystals in contact with air at different relative humidities are measured and are found to vary with the air humidity. The moisture content of lysozyme crystals in air at high relative humidities (> 80 % RH) approach that of crystals whose interstices are fully filled with liquid (as in solution). These results suggest that the density of lysozyme crystals would vary significantly with the humidity of the air in which they are stored. Nucleation thresholds are estimated from nucleation induction periods measured at different levels of supersaturation, solution temperature, pH and buffer and sodium chloride concentrations. Primary nucleation induction periods are significantly influenced by solution pH, buffer concentration and supersaturation. Secondary nucleation induction periods are significantly influenced by solution pH, sodium chloride concentration and supersaturation. Supersaturation is the factor with the greatest influence on the induction periods for both primary and secondary nucleation. The induction period for primary nucleation decreases approximately log-linearly with increasing supersaturation. The estimated primary nucleation threshold for a nominated induction period of 1 hour is approximately 9 times the solubility concentration. The estimated secondary nucleation threshold for a nominated induction period of 1 hour was approximately 4 times the solubility concentration. These nucleation thresholds are used to select operating conditions for nucleation experiments of this thesis. Fluid-shear secondary nucleation occurs when circulating crystallizer solution shears off material from a growing crystal surface to become nuclei in solution. The importance of fluid-shear secondary nucleation in protein crystallization is assessed. Methods used by others to investigate fluid-shear nucleation for non-protein systems are further developed and applied for the first time to the crystallization of a protein system (hen egg white lysozyme). Secondary nucleation occurs, but the results do not suggest that fluid-shear nucleation significantly contributes to the overall nucleation kinetics. Secondary nucleation rates are measured for lysozyme crystallization in a stirred vessel at different conditions of solution temperature, sodium chloride concentration, supersaturation, stirring speed, the volume of seed crystals added and seed crystal size. Lysozyme crystallization exhibits moderate secondary nucleation rates when compared with that found by literature studies on the continuous crystallization of potassium sulphate and glutamic acid. Thus, the substantial differences in mechanical strength between crystals of lysozyme and these non-proteins are not reflected by substantial differences in secondary nucleation rates, perhaps due to the influence of inertia and its effects on the frequency of crystal collisions. Fluid-shear nucleation in the crystallization of non-proteins exhibits a strong dependency on supersaturation. The influence of supersaturation on the kinetics of secondary nucleation for lysozyme crystallization is found to be not significant over experimental variability. This observation indicates that fluid-shear nucleation is not likely to be an important mechanism in the crystallization of lysozyme. This observation supports the findings of the fluid-shear experiments. Increasing stirring speed is found to increase the kinetics of secondary nucleation in lysozyme crystallization, which can indicate that secondary nucleation by attrition is occurring. The amount and size of seed crystals typically exert a notable influence on attrition-based secondary nucleation in the crystallization of nonproteins. It is observed that these variables do not significantly influence secondary nucleation rates for stirred lysozyme crystallization. The influence of these variables may be overshadowed by the well-known experimental variability of secondary nucleation rates, which is also observed in the experiments of this thesis. In answer to the research question of this thesis, the overall findings indicates that nucleation by attrition is likely to be a mechanism of secondary nucleation which is shared by the crystallization of many non-proteins and the crystallization of the model protein hen egg white lysozyme. Studies in the literature show that fluid-shear nucleation occurs in the crystallization of the non-proteins: sucrose, citric acid, <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>heptahydrate</b> and potash alum. The observations of this thesis indicate that fluid-shear nucleation is not a significant mechanism of secondary nucleation in the crystallization of lysozyme...|$|E

The first objective {{of this study was}} to examine whether inhaled <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> exerts bronchodilator activity measured as bronchoprotection against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in conscious guinea-pigs alone and combined with salbutamol. Secondly, we examined whether inhaled <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> inhibits airways inflammation and function in models of neutrophilic and eosinophilic lung inflammation induced, respectively, by inhaled lipopolysaccharide or the inhaled antigen, ovalbumin (OVA). Airway function was measured in conscious guinea-pigs as specific airway conductance (sGaw) by whole-body plethysmography. Anti-inflammatory activity was measured against lung inflammatory cell influx induced by OVA inhalation in OVA-sensitised animals or by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure of non-sensitised animals. Airway function (sGaw) was measured over 24 h after OVA exposure.

40|$|<b>Magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> is {{recommended}} by international guidelines to prevent eclampsia among women with pre-eclampsia, {{especially when it}} is severe, but fewer than 70 % of such women receive <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate.</b> We aimed to identify variables that prompt Canadian physicians to administer <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> to women with pre-eclampsia. Data were used from the Canadian Perinatal Network (2005 - 11) of women hospitalized at < 29 weeks' who {{were thought to be}} at high risk of delivery due to pre-eclampsia (using broad Canadian definition). Unadjusted analyses of relative risks were estimated directly and population attributable risk percent (PAR%) calculated to identify variables associated with <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> use. A multivariable model was created and a generalized estimating equation was used to estimate the adjusted RR that explained <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> use in pre-eclampsia.

40|$|Background: <b>Magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> {{has been}} used in some {{settings}} as a tocolytic agent to inhibit uterine activity in women in preterm labour with the aim of preventing preterm birth. Objectives: To assess the effects of <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> therapy given to women in threatened preterm labour with the aim of preventing preterm birth and its sequelae. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register (last searched 31 January 2014). Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials of <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> as the only tocolytic, administered by any route, compared with either placebo, no treatment or alternative tocolytic therapy (not <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate)</b> to women considered to be in preterm labour. Data collection and analysis: At least two review authors assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and undertook data extraction independently. Main results: The 37 included trials (total of 3571 women and over 3600 babies) were generally of moderate to high risk of bias. Antenatal <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> was compared with either placebo, no treatment, or a range of alternative tocolytic agents. For the primary outcome of giving birth within 48 hours after trial entry, no significant differences were seen between women who received <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> and women who did not (whether placebo/no alternative tocolytic drug, betamimetics, calcium channel blockers, cox inhibitors, prostaglandin inhibitors, or human chorionic gonadotropin) (19 trials, 1913 women). Similarly for the primary outcome of serious infant outcome, {{there were no significant differences}} between the infants exposed to <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> and those not (whether placebo/no alternative tocolytic drug, betamimetics, calcium channel blockers, cox inhibitors, prostaglandin inhibitors, human chorionic gonadotropin or various tocolytic drugs) (18 trials; 2187 babies). No trials reported the outcome of extremely preterm birth. In the seven trials that reported serious maternal outcomes, no events were recorded. In the group treated with <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> compared with women receiving antenatal placebo or no alternative tocolytic drug, a borderline increased risk of total death (fetal, neonatal, infant) was seen (risk ratio (RR) 4. 56, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 00 to 20. 86; two trials, 257 babies); none of the comparisons between <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> and other classes of tocolytic drugs showed differences for this outcome (10 trials, 991 babies). The outcomes of neonatal and/or infant deaths and of fetal deaths did not show differences between <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> and no <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate,</b> whether compared with placebo/no alternative tocolytic drug, or any specific class of tocolytic drug. For most of the other secondary outcomes, there were no significant differences between <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> and the control groups for risk of preterm birth (except for a significantly lower risk with <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> when compared with barbiturates in one trial of 65 women), gestational age at birth, interval between trial entry and birth, other neonatal morbidities, or neurodevelopmental outcomes. Duration of neonatal intensive care unit stay was significantly increased in the <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> group compared with the calcium channel blocker group, but not when compared with cox inhibitors or prostaglandin inhibitors. No maternal deaths were reported in the four trials reporting this outcome. Significant differences between <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> and controls were not seen for maternal adverse events severe enough to stop treatment, except for a significant benefit of <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> compared with betamimetics in a single trial. Authors’ conclusions: <b>Magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> is ineffective at delaying birth or preventing preterm birth, has no apparent advantages for a range of neonatal and maternal outcomes as a tocolytic agent and its use for this indication may be associated with an increased risk of total fetal, neonatal or infant mortality (in contrast to its use in appropriate groups of women for maternal, fetal, neonatal and infant neuroprotection where beneficial effects have been demonstrated).

SELECTION CRITERIA: TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: Women thought to be in preterm labour. Types of interventions: <b>Magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> as the only tocolytic, administered intravenously or orally, compared with either placebo, no treatment or alternative tocolytic therapy. Types of outcome measures: Measures of effectiveness, complications, women's satisfaction with their care and health service use. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Assessments of trial eligibility, quality and data extractions were done by {{at least two of the}} reviewers. MAIN RESULTS: Over 2000 women were recruited into the 23 included trials. Only nine trials were rated of high quality for the concealment of allocation.

METHODS: A systematic and comprehensive search of the literature was performed to identify controlled clinical trials of <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> in paediatric acute asthma which evaluated outcomes of hospitalisation or short term pulmonary function tests or symptom scores. Unpublished data were searched by personal contacts with authors and specialists. Two reviewers independently assessed trial qualities and synthesised data. Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated by the Cochrane Q test. Outcome data were pooled by random or fixed effect models depending on presence or absence of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Five randomised placebo controlled trials involving a total of 182 patients were identified. They compared intravenous <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> to placebo in treating paediatric patients with moderate to severe asthmatic attacks in the emergency department, with co-therapies of inhaled beta 2 agonists and systemic steroids. The studies were of high quality with results judged to be valid. Four studies showed that <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> was effective, while one study found it ineffective. There was no significant heterogeneity in the primary outcome of hospitalisation. In the fixed effect model, <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> is effective in preventing hospitalisation (OR 0. 290, 95 % CI 0. 143 to 0. 589). The number needed to treat is 4 (95 % CI 3 to 8).
