5|$|In June 2016 it was {{revealed}} that a five-man New IRA hit team were in Dublin's north inner city looking to murder two leading gangsters after one of their associates was shot dead in a gangland feud. Sources said the <b>murder</b> <b>squad</b> from the North spent several days and nights looking for their targets in the streets. In September 2016 a close associate of Alan Ryan, who had been arrested and imprisoned following the Stamullen raid, was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment in Belfast for possession of a sub-machine gun and ammunition, after getting off a bus from Dublin.|$|E
25|$|Within {{three days}} of the crime, prime {{suspects}} had been identified. No arrests were made, however, until over {{two weeks after the}} killing. The officer who had been leading the murder investigation from its third day, and who would ultimately lead the <b>murder</b> <b>squad</b> for 14 months, explained to an incredulous public inquiry in 1998 that part of the reason no arrests had taken place by the fourth day after the killing (Monday 26 April) was that he had not known the law allowed arrest upon reasonable suspicion – a basic point of criminal law.|$|E
25|$|Carl Ferdinand Feigenbaum (executed 27 April 1896) was a {{merchant}} seaman arrested in 1894 in New York City for cutting {{the throat of}} Mrs Juliana Hoffmann. After his execution, his lawyer, William Sanford Lawton, claimed that Feigenbaum had admitted to having a hatred of women {{and a desire to}} kill and mutilate them. Lawton further stated that he believed Feigenbaum was Jack the Ripper. Though covered by the press at the time, the idea was not pursued for more than a century. Using Lawton's accusation as a base, author Trevor Marriott, a former British <b>murder</b> <b>squad</b> detective, argued that Feigenbaum was responsible for the Ripper murders as well as other murders in the United States and Germany between 1891 and 1894. According to Wolf Vanderlinden, some of the murders listed by Marriott did not actually occur; the newspapers often embellished or created Ripper-like stories to sell copy. Lawton's accusations were disputed by a partner in his legal firm, Hugh O. Pentecost, and there is no proof that Feigenbaum was in Whitechapel {{at the time of the}} murders. Xanthé Mallett, a Scottish forensic anthropologist and criminologist who investigated the case in 2011, wrote there is considerable doubt that all of the Jack the Ripper murders were committed by the same person. She concludes that it is possible Feigenbaum committed one of the murders but not all.|$|E

Scorcher Kennedy is given the case because he is the <b>Murder</b> <b>Squad’s</b> star detective. At first he and his rookie partner, Richie, think this is a simple one: Pat Spain was a casualty of the recession, so he killed his children, tried to kill his wife Jenny, and finished off with himself. But there are too many inexplicable details and the evidence is pointing in two directions at once.|$|R
2500|$|In Brazil, {{hate crime}} laws focus on racism, racial injury, {{and other special}} bias-motivated crimes such as, for example, <b>murder</b> by death <b>squads</b> and {{genocide}} {{on the grounds of}} nationality, ethnicity, race or religion. <b>Murder</b> by death <b>squads</b> and genocide are legally classified as [...] "hideous crimes" [...] (crimes hediondos in Portuguese).|$|R
500|$|Bond {{experienced}} the Fraud Squad, the Flying Squad, the <b>Murder</b> <b>Squad,</b> {{and became the}} first commander of the newly formed Bomb Squad (later the Anti-Terrorist Branch, now merged into Counter Terrorism Command). His notable achievements in the bomb squad were negotiating the rise of The Angry Brigade, eventually jailing several members. The other major event he negotiated as commander with the Bomb Squad was the Balcombe Street siege, in which two people were taken hostage by four Irish Republican Army members, who demanded a plane to Ireland. Bond, answering the demands, refused saying that the police [...] "are not going to make any deals". The gunmen surrendered, the event a success for police with no casualties on either side.|$|E
500|$|When Bond was {{released}} from his imprisonment by the Axis, he was demobilised in 1946 and entered the Metropolitan Police with the warrant number 128434, realising his pre-war ambition. He was 'on the beat' for 2 years, working in Lambeth with 'M' division. His division became 'E' division, patrolling Holborn, {{when he decided to}} enter the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in 1948. He experienced another promotion in 1957, to become a Detective Sergeant; [...] "he began to develop a reputation for his discerning skill as a detective." [...] Bond rapidly experienced both the Fraud Squad and the Flying Squad; and in 1963 joined the <b>Murder</b> <b>Squad</b> at the rank of Detective Inspector.|$|E
500|$|Following a {{television}} news report on 4 January 2011 that criticised {{the handling of}} the investigation, ITN reporters were banned by the Avon and Somerset Constabulary from attending a press conference convened to give updates on the murder case. The item, presented by journalist Geraint Vincent, claimed police had made little progress with their investigation, and questioned whether they were following correct procedural methods. A former <b>murder</b> <b>squad</b> detective told the report that [...] "certain routine inquiries" [...] such as looking for fresh evidence at the crime scene were not being carried out. ITN accused the police of attempting [...] "to censor what information we can broadcast" [...] while the constabulary {{filed a complaint with the}} Office of Communications, calling the broadcast [...] "unfair, naïve and irresponsible reporting". The police subsequently lifted the sanctions against ITN, but said that they would [...] "not hesitate to adopt similar tactics in the future." [...] Legal action was also considered over a tweet revealing that Tabak had viewed internet pornography showing erotic asphyxiation and bondage. The contempt of court charges were dropped after the tweet was removed.|$|E

5000|$|A {{particularly}} notorious {{example was}} the Franciscan friar Tomislav Filipović, {{also known as}} Miroslav Filipović-Majstorović, known as [...] "Fra Sotona" [...] ("Friar Satan"), [...] "the devil of Jasenovac", for running the Jasenovac concentration camp, where {{estimates of the number}} killed range between 49,600 and 600,000. According to Evans, Filipović led <b>murder</b> <b>squads</b> at Jasenovac. According to the Jasenovac Memorial Site, [...] "Because of his participation in the mass murders in February 1942 the church authorities excommunicated him from the Franciscan order, which was confirmed by the Holy See in July 1942." [...] He was also required to relinquish the right to his religious name, Tomislav. When he was hanged for war crimes, however, he wore his clerical garb.|$|R
2500|$|The {{investigation}} {{was taken over}} from Eastbourne police on 17 August 1956 by two officers from the Metropolitan Police's <b>Murder</b> <b>Squad.</b> The senior officer, Detective Superintendent Herbert Hannam of Scotland Yard, was known for having solved the Teddington Towpath Murders in 1953. He was assisted by Detective Sergeant Charles Hewett. Hannam was in the unusual position that, {{instead of having to}} find a suspect for a known crime, he had a known suspect in Adams but needed to link him to more serious crimes than forging prescriptions, making false statements and mishandling drugs. Devlin suggests that Hannam became fixated on the idea that Adams had murdered many elderly patients for legacies, regarding his receiving a legacy as grounds for suspicion, although Adams was generally only a minor beneficiary.|$|E
2500|$|Rawlinson {{was called}} to the bar at Inner Temple in 1946, just {{before he left the}} Army. He later became a Bencher in 1962 and was Treasurer in 1984. He joined the {{chambers}} of Walter Monckton. The first of his cases that came to public attention was that of Alfred Charles Whiteway, in the Towpath murder case in 1953, in which he was junior counsel. [...] He subjected the leading police <b>murder</b> <b>squad</b> detective, Herbert Hannam, to a searching cross-examination over 2 days, which exposed substantial gaps in Hannam's account of a confession by Whiteway. [...] Whiteway was convicted and hanged, but Rawlinson was instructed in other well-known cases. He was also a junior counsel in the unsuccessful defence of Peter Wildeblood, tried with Edward Montagu and Michael Pitt-Rivers for gross indecency in 1954. A year later in 1955, he was junior counsel for Melford Stevenson in the defence of Ruth Ellis, who was hanged. He also acted in defence of General Anders in a libel case.|$|E

50|$|While the {{activities}} of the Police Regiment South, the Einsatzgruppen detachment and the 1st SS Brigade, progressed, the reports by the <b>murder</b> <b>squads</b> were being intercepted and decoded by MI6, the British intelligence service. As part of Ultra, British signals intelligence program, the codebreaking facilities at Bletchley Park decoded and analysed the messages. The first message decrypted was the 18 July report on the mass murders by the Police Regiment Centre of over 1,100 Jews at Slonim, in the Army Group Centre Rear Area. In late July and early August, similar reports were intercepted on a regular basis. The first messages mentioning the murders by the Police Regiment South were intercepted on August 23, with Police Battalion 314 reporting executions of 367 Jews south-east of Kiev.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{acknowledgement}} of Nazi war crimes became unavoidable. The {{departure of the}} SS leadership from Flensburg {{opened the way for}} the Dönitz government to offer its own version of how the <b>murder</b> <b>squads,</b> concentration camps and killing facilities had come into being. Their response was that all these atrocities had been undertaken in secret, and entirely by Himmler and the SS. Dönitz and Jodl issued a joint public statement [...] "that neither the German Wehrmacht nor the German people had knowledge of these things." [...] While this statement was wholly untrue, the consequent myth of the [...] "good Wehrmacht" [...] as having been deceived and betrayed by the [...] "evil SS" [...] was to achieve wide currency for decades in post-war Germany.|$|R

40|$|Investigating Murder {{provides}} a unique {{insight into how}} police detectives investigate and solve murders. Based upon fieldwork observation of <b>murder</b> <b>squads</b> at work, interviews with detectives and detailed analysis of police case files, it {{provides a}}n original and innovative account of the practices and processes involved {{in the investigation of}} homicides, {{as well as some of}} the problems that are often encountered in the conduct of this work. Drawing upon the detailed empirical data collected, the book develops a conceptual framework for understanding the methods that detectives seek to utilise in order to identify suspects and construct a case against them. Situating such work in its social and legal context this major study shows how interviews, forensic evidence, and other investigative techniques are used by detectives to manufacture a narrative of the crime that sets out how the incident took place, and who did what to whom. In so doing, the book does much to further our understandings of detective work, how detectives understand their role, the problems they encounter and the solutions they manufacture to solve these problems. The description and analysis provided will be of interest to academic researchers and students in the fields of policing and criminology, as well as practitioners working in the criminal justice system...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Final Solution to the Jewish Question" [...] (German: Endlösung der Judenfrage) was the Nazis' own term, {{recorded}} in the minutes of the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942, and translated into English for the Nuremberg Trials in 1945. Before the word [...] "Holocaust" [...] became normative this phrase was also used by writers in English. For example, in William Shirer's The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, the genocide is described as [...] "The Final Solution" [...] (in quotation marks; the word [...] "Holocaust" [...] is not mentioned). In both English and German, [...] "Final Solution" [...] has been widely used {{as an alternative to}} [...] "Holocaust". Whereas the term [...] "Holocaust" [...] is now often used to include all casualties of the Nazi death camps and <b>murder</b> <b>squads,</b> the [...] "Final Solution" [...] refers exclusively to [...] "the attempt to annihilate the Jewish people," [...] as defined at the site pf the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. For a time after World War II, German historians also used the term Völkermord ("genocide"), or in full, der Völkermord an den Juden ("the genocide of the Jewish people"), while the prevalent term in Germany today is either Holocaust or increasingly Shoah.|$|R
