25|$|In 1956, however, a new motel along {{what is now}} State Route 59 {{just east}} of the city limits opened, known as the Eastwood <b>Motor</b> <b>Inn.</b> It {{featured}} endorsement from AAA and other modern amenities like ample parking and air conditioning, which the Hotel Kent lacked. Other factors such as the decline in railroad travel and the emergence of the automobile led to a decrease in the need for regional hotels. In 1962, the hotel came under the management of Frank Ellis and was renamed Hotel Kent-Ellis. Financial fortunes continued to decline as two more modern motels opened in Kent: the nearby <b>Motor</b> <b>Inn</b> (later known as the Inn of Kent) in 1964 and the eight-story University Inn along South Water Street in 1970. In the 1970s, with the building in decline and the hotel operations no longer profitable, it was sold to Joseph Bujack and converted to student housing, known as the Towne House. Damage from a number of fires in the 1970s and the deteriorated state of the building led the city to condemn the upper floors in January 1979. Those floors remained vacant until 2013. The lower floors continued to be used until 2000 for a variety of small businesses such as a pizza shop, cafe, and nightclubs.|$|E

40|$|In their {{dialogue}} - An Analysis of Stock Market Performance: The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Three Top Performing Lodging Firms 1982 – 1988 - by N. H. Ringstrom, Professor and Elisa S. Moncarz, Associate Professor, School of Hospitality Management at Florida International University, Professors Ringstrom and Moncarz {{state at}} the outset: “An interesting comparison can be made between the Dow Jones lndustrial Average and the three top performing, publicly held lodging firms which had 100 million or more in annual lodging revenues. The authors provide that analytical comparison with Prime <b>Motor</b> <b>Inns</b> Inc., the Marriott Corporation, and Hilton Hotels Corporation. ” “Based on a criterion of size, only those with 100 million in annual lodging revenues or more resulted in {{the inclusion of the}} following six major hotel firms: Prime <b>Motor</b> <b>Inns,</b> Inc., Marriott Corporation, Hilton Hotels Corporation, Ramada Inc., Holiday Corporation and La Quinta <b>Motor</b> <b>Inns,</b> Inc.,” say Professors Ringstrom and Moncarz in framing this discussion with its underpinnings in the years 1982 to 1988. The article looks at each company’s fiscal and Dow Jones performance for the years in question, and presents a detailed analysis of said performance. Graphic analysis is included. It helps to have a fairly vigorous knowledge of stock market and fiscal examination criteria to digest this material. The Ringstrom and Moncarz analysis of Prime <b>Motor</b> <b>Inns</b> Incorporated occupies the first 7 pages of this article in and of itself. Marriot Corporation also occupies a prominent position in this discussion. “Marriott, a giant in the hospitality industry, is huge and continuing to grow. Its 1987 sales were more than 6. 5 billion, and its employees numbered over 200, 000 individuals, which place Marriott among the 10 largest private employers in the country,” Ringstrom and Moncarz parse Marriott’s influence as a significant financial player. “The firm has a fantastic history of growth over the past 60 years, starting in May 1927 with a nine-seat A 2 ̆ 6 W Root Beer stand in Washington, D. C.,” offer the authors in initialing Marriot’s portion of the discussion with a brief history lesson. The Marriot firm was officially incorporated as Hot Shoppes Inc. in 1929. As the thesis statement for the discussion suggests the performance of these huge, hospitality giants is compared and contrasted directly to the Dow Jones Industrial Average performance. Reasons and empirical data are offered by the authors to explain the distinctions. It would be difficult to explain those distinctions without delving deeply into corporate financial history and the authors willingly do so in an effort to help you understand the growth, {{as well as some of}} the setbacks of these hospitality based juggernauts. Ringstrom and Moncarz conclude the article with an extensive overview and analysis of the Hilton Hotels Corporation performance for the period outlined. It may well be the most fiscally dynamic of the firms presented for your perusal. “It is interesting to note that Hilton Hotels Corporation maintained a very strong financial position with relatively little debt during the years 1982 - 1988 …the highest among all companies in the study,” the authors paint...|$|R

50|$|The road brought lots {{of traffic}} through {{the hills of}} Arkansas, {{previously}} resistant to development. Eureka Springs was a popular stop on the route, with many <b>motor</b> <b>inns</b> and a vibrant downtown. Nearby Arkansas Highway 23 (The Pig Trail) further added tourists to the community. Further east, cities of Mountain Home, Cotter, and Flippin grew significantly with US 62's traffic. Rough terrain interspersed with large waterways caused the need for large bridges, including the Cotter Bridge (which replaced a ferry system) and the St. Louis-San Francisco Overpass. A 1981 study indicated a need of 31 climbing lanes from Harrison to Hardy (approx. 110 mi) necessary for safety purposes, indicative of the rough terrain.|$|R
5000|$|Prime <b>Motors</b> <b>Inns</b> {{continued}} {{to preserve the}} lodges, just as Marriott had, until weak hotel and real estate markets caused it to sell off its assets and cease operations in 1990.

They successfully obtained all the rights to operate and maintain the company owned and franchised lodges. With these rights maintained, they changed their name to [...] "Howard Johnson International Incorporated," [...] which became a subsidiary of [...] "Hospitality Franchise Systems Incorporated," [...] which eventually merged with other companies to form Cendant. In 2006, Cendant split itself into Wyndham Worldwide and three other companies.|$|R

Michael Hostage, then CEO of Continental Baking Company and formerly {{executive vice president of}} Marriott Corporation, to replace Johnson as CEO. After four years, however, and despite evident progress in a turnaround, Imperial reversed course and decided to sell the company instead. Having declined to entertain Hostage's proposal to lead a leveraged buyout,Imperial employed Goldman Sachs who, with Hostage's assistance, sold the company to Marriott in 1986.

40|$|UK, USA, Japan and China. International and {{domestic}} tourists in New Zealand use {{a range of}} accommodation in their travel, from private homes to commercial and other accommodation. Tourist accommodation types are classified under the following five categories: hotels (include resorts), motels (<b>motor</b> <b>inns,</b> apartments and motels), hosted (private hotels, guesthouses, bed and breakfast and farm stays), backpackers/hostels, and caravan parks/camping grounds (Ministry of Tourism, 2008 b). Figure 1 shows that tourist accommodation available from 1997 to 2007 is predominantly hotels and motels. Seasonality has attracted considerable interest in empirical tourism research and forecasting. However, the analysis of such recurring phenomenon is sparse in hospitality research, with only one study to date having analysed seasonal unit roots prior to forecasting guest nights for the tourist lodging industry. This paper examines the seasonality of hotel-motel occupancy in New Zealand using monthly time series from 1997 to 2007. The presence of seasonal unit roots is detected using the HEGY procedures. Numerous Box-Jenkins models are estimated and the twelve differenced SARMA(2, 2) (0, 2) 12 is the optimal model selected to forecast hotel-motel room nights...|$|R
