5|$|Peada's {{conversion}} {{and the introduction}} of priests into Middle Anglia could be seen as evidence of Penda's tolerance of Christianity, given the absence of evidence that he sought to interfere. On the other hand, an interpretation is also possible whereby the marriage and conversion could be seen as corresponding to a successful attempt on Oswiu's part to expand Bernician influence at Penda's expense; Higham saw Peada's conversion <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of political manoeuvring on both sides than religious zeal.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest VII is {{best known}} for its huge size. Without {{completing}} the game's side quests, a single game of Dragon Quest VII can take a hundred hours or <b>more.</b> <b>In</b> <b>terms</b> of gameplay, not much has changed from previous installments; battles are still fought in a turn-based mode from a first person perspective. Although non-battle sequences are rendered in 3D, battles themselves are still portrayed two dimensionally. The ability to talk with the party characters in and outside of battles was added to this game. They offer advice about battle strategies and plot points, or simply comment on how they feel at a given moment. There are four ways and means of locomotion: feet, boat, magic carpet, and skystone. Each of these can move across different terrain.|$|E
5|$|Sleaford {{served the}} {{surrounding}} agricultural {{communities and the}} town maintained a weekly market throughout the 19th century and a livestock market on Northgate from 1874 until 1984. According to a 2010 council report, the public sector was the town's main employer, along with agriculture and manufacturing. Unemployment was lower {{than the national average}} as were wages reflecting pay in the food processing and agricultural industries. At the 2011 Census, the largest group of working-age persons by economic activity are those in full-time employment, who make up 43.8% of this section of the population, while 15% are part-time employees and 7.7% are self-employed; 15% of the working-age population are retired. 4.2% were unemployed, with 40% of those in long-term unemployment and roughly one third were aged 16 to 24. The largest socio-economic grouping is those working in lower-tier managerial or administrative roles (21.9%), followed by semi-routine (17.8%), routine (15%) and intermediate (12.5%) occupations; no other group comprised 10% or <b>more.</b> <b>In</b> <b>terms</b> of industry, the most common, based on those working in the sector, are wholesale and retail trade (including automotive repairs) at 16.9%, health and social care (13.4%), public administration and defence (13.3%) and manufacturing (10.9%), with no other groups representing 10% or more. An unemployment survey of Lincolnshire in 2014 found that the county experienced a decline in unemployment (based on Jobseekers Allowance claimants) by 29% over the preceding 12 months, while the county's unemployment rate was marginally below the national average.|$|E

25|$|Between 1964 and 1968, {{benefits}} in kind were significantly progressive, in that over the period those in {{the lower half of}} the income scale benefited more than those in the upper half. On average those receiving state benefits benefited <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of increases in real disposable income than the average manual worker or salaried employee between 1964 and 1969. From 1964 to 1969, low-wage earners did substantially better than other sections of the population. In 1969, a married couple with two children were 11.5% per cent richer in real terms, while for a couple with three children, the corresponding increase was 14.5%, and for a family with four children, 16.5%. From 1965 to 1968, the income of single pensioner households as a percentage of other one adult households rose from 48.9% to 52.5%. For two pensioner households, the equivalent increase was from 46.8% to 48.2%. In addition, mainly as a result of big increases in cash benefits, unemployed persons and large families gained <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of real disposable income than the rest of the population during Wilson's time in office.|$|E

25|$|Creativity {{is viewed}} {{differently}} in different countries. For example, cross-cultural research centred on Hong Kong found that Westerners view creativity <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> {{of the individual}} attributes of a creative person, such as their aesthetic taste, while Chinese people view creativity <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of the social influence of creative people e.g. what they can contribute to society. Mpofu et al. surveyed 28 African languages and found that 27 had no word which directly translated to 'creativity' (the exception being Arabic). The principle of linguistic relativity, i.e. that language can affect thought, suggests {{that the lack of}} an equivalent word for 'creativity' may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages. However, more research would be needed to establish this, and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less (or more) creative; Africa has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as music, art, and storytelling. Nevertheless, it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa, and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America. Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere, but here again there are cultural differences, even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity. For example, in Scandinavian countries, creativity is seen as an individual attitude which helps in coping with life's challenges, while in Germany, creativity is seen more as a process that can be applied to help solve problems.|$|E
25|$|The Gospel of John {{focuses on}} God's glory in {{his use of}} light imagery and in his {{presentation}} of the Cross as a moment of exaltation; he also sees the Cross as the example of agape love, a love which {{is not so much}} an emotion as a willingness to serve and care for others. But in stressing love, John shifts the goal of spiritual growth away from knowledge/gnosis, which he presents <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of Stoic ideas about the role of reason as being the underlying principle of the universe and as the spiritual principle within all people. Although John does not follow up on the Stoic notion that this principle makes union with the divine possible for humanity, it is an idea that later Christian writers develop. Later generations will also shift back and forth between whether to follow the Synoptics in stressing knowledge or John in stressing love.|$|E

500|$|Final Nintendo 64 {{specifications}} {{and development}} workstations were not initially available to Rare: a modified Sega Saturn controller {{was used for}} some early playtesting, and the developers had to estimate what the finalised console's capabilities would be. The final Nintendo 64 hardware could render polygons faster than the SGI Onyx workstations they had been using, but the game's textures had to be cut down by half. Karl Hilton explained one method of improving the game's performance: [...] "A lot of GoldenEye is in black and white. RGB colour textures cost a lot <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of processing power. You could do double the resolution if you used greyscale, so a lot was done like that. If I needed a bit of colour, I'd add it in the vertex." [...] At one time, developers planned to implement the reloading of the weapons by the player unplugging and re-inserting the Rumble Pak on the Nintendo 64 controller, though this idea was discarded at Nintendo's behest.|$|E
