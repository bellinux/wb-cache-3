25|$|The Lemba, a Bantu-speaking {{group of}} people from {{southern}} Africa, primarily Zimbabwe and South Africa, consider themselves of Jewish descent, although most practice Christianity or Islam. They emphasize eating only meats slaughtered by special ritual. They have endogamous marriage practices. If a <b>man</b> <b>wants</b> to marry a non-Lemba woman, she must adopt all the Lemba practices and traditions, including keeping meat and dairy foods separate. No male non-Lemba are accepted into the group, even by conversion.|$|E

To deliberately stand up and turn your back to a battle is in itself hard work. To deliberately stand up and turn your back to a battle and hear immediate evidences of the boundless enthusiasm with which a large company of the enemy shoot at you from an adjacent thicket is, to my mind at least, a very great feat. One need not dwell upon the detail of keeping the mind carefully upon a slow spelling of an important code message.|$|E

With blacks given control of one of South Carolina's seven congressional districts, the question of black influence in state politics seemed settled and did not {{play a significant role in}} the campaign for the Democratic nomination for governor. Haskell's appeals for support, added to speculation that Tillman was trying to form a biracial coalition through the Farmers' Alliance (which, though segregated, had a parallel organization for black farmers) made race an issue.

500|$|An {{official}} synopsis {{published in}} the Billboard states, [...] "Bertie Fawcett is a dudish chap, who believes that he has won the heart of May Vernon. May, however, regards Bertie as very much of a joke, and {{is in love with}} Jack Mace, who is her ideal of manly beauty. May's father has no objection to Jack personally, but he does not propose that the daughter he idolizes shall wed a weakling or a ne'er do well. Therefore, he tells May in a letter that if 'that young <b>man</b> <b>wants</b> to marry you, he must show his ability by earning his own living during vacation.' Unfortunately for Bertie, he sees the letter, and egotistically jumps to the conclusion that he is the person referred to. He starts out to make his own living, but soon finds that it is not as easy as it sounds. He is successfully a writer, a billposter, a village constable, and a living target in the baseball show, but fails to shine in any one sphere. And then to cap the climax, when he returns to claim his bride, he finds that May is married to Jack." ...|$|E
500|$|Juxtaposed {{against the}} {{struggle}} to survive is the enchanting but short beauty of childhood. The magic in the plot reinforces the sense of enchantment and gives the book a fairy-tale like quality, leading the BolognaRagazzi Awards jury to speak of [...] "the great Secret (that) lurks in the story". It is the child Calpurnia who follows the magic to find the river and save the adults from starvation. The contrast of an idealized and protected childhood with the harsh realities that adults must face is another theme common to Rawlings' writings, expressed in the famous speech about adult reality Ezra [...] "Penny" [...] Baxter delivers to his son Jody {{at the end of}} The Yearling: [...] "Ever’ <b>man</b> <b>wants</b> life to be a fine thing, and [...] easy. ’Tis fine, boy, powerful fine, but ’tain’t easy. Life knocks a man down and he gits up and it knocks him down again.... What’s he to do then?... Why, take it for his share and go on." [...] Unlike Jody, who realizes the magic of his childhood is [...] "gone forever" [...] with the death of his fawn, Calpurnia retains the secret river and the magic in her mind.|$|E

500|$|Side Two {{opens with}} the young man's dying {{thoughts}} turning to his recent breakup with the unnamed lover ("Two Out of Three Ain't Bad"); the song was written quite late in the album's production, shortly before the album was released. The song documents the breakup of a relationship where {{despite the fact that}} the <b>man</b> <b>wants</b> and needs the woman, he will never love her; he tries to be positive and supportive, however, in emphasizing that wanting her and needing her are very positive things—i.e., [...] "ain't bad"—which gives the song an ironic twist. A further twist is that the reason the man will never love the woman is because he already loves another woman, who broke up with him because she already loved another man. Rundgren identifies how the song was influenced by the Eagles, who were successful at the time. The producer also highlights the [...] "underlying humor in the lyrics", citing the line [...] "There ain't no Coupe de Ville hiding at the bottom of a Cracker Jack box." [...] He says you could only [...] "get away" [...] with that lyric [...] "in a Meat Loaf song".|$|E
500|$|Branded to Kill was {{released}} to Japanese theatres on June 15, 1967, {{in a double}} bill with Nishimura Shōgorō's Burning Nature. The films were financially unsuccessful and the former fared likewise among critics. Kinema Junpo magazine reported that the films [...] "resulted in less than [...] viewers at Asakusa and Shinjuku and about 500 at Yurakucho on the second day." [...] Both Joe Shishido and Yamatoya Atsushi later recounted having seen Branded to Kill in practically empty theatres, the latter on its opening night. Iijima Kōichi, a critic for the film journal Eiga Geijutsu, wrote that [...] "the woman buys a mink coat and thinks only about having sex. The <b>man</b> <b>wants</b> to kill and feels nostalgic about the smell of boiling rice. We cannot help being confused. We {{do not go to}} theaters to be puzzled." [...] Nikkatsu Studios had been criticized for catering to rebellious youth audiences, a specialty of contract director Seijun Suzuki, whose films had grown increasingly anarchic through the 1960s. This had earned him a large following but it had also drawn the ire of studio head Kyūsaku Hori. On April 25, 1968, Suzuki received a telephone call from a company secretary informing him {{that he would not be}} receiving his salary that month. Two of Suzuki's friends met with Hori the next day and were told, [...] "Suzuki's films were incomprehensible, that they did not make any money and that Suzuki might as well give up his career as a director as he would not be making films for any other companies." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{she hears}} nothing from Milda after their night together, she still expects to reunite with her dream man shortly, so she breaks off with Tonda, who storms the {{dormitory}} demanding his ring back. After {{listening to a}} speech by the housemother on the virtues of fidelity and commitment, she packs up her suitcase and arrives on Milda's doorstep in the big city, ready to resume their romance. Milda is not home, and she meets his parents, who {{have never heard of}} her and don't know what they should do with her. Milda comes home very late, and after an evening of comically painful tension and uncertainty, his parents decide it's only decent to put the girl up for the night on the sofa, requiring Milda to climb into bed with them in order to avoid any appearance of impropriety. Forman has described this famous scene: [...] "It’s a tight fit. The old <b>man</b> <b>wants</b> to sleep; the son would like to get thrown out so he can join the girl on the couch, but the mother runs the show and won’t tolerate any such filthy ideas under her roof." [...] Andula, kneeling outside the door of their bedroom, overhears the family squabbling, and when it becomes clear to her that she is not valued in the least, she breaks down in tears and, the next morning, returns to her home. She tells her friends about her [...] "wonderful" [...] trip to the capital and how nice Milda's parents were to her, especially his father, and then she returns to work at the factory.|$|E

2500|$|The Democrats {{said that}} would fatten the rich; the tariff should be low—for [...] "revenue only" [...] (thus not to foster manufacturing). Whigs argued that banks and paper money were needed; the Democrats countered that no honest <b>man</b> <b>wants</b> them. Public works {{programs}} to build roads, canals and railroads would give the country the infrastructure it needed for rapid economic development, said the Whigs. Democrats replied {{they did not want}} that kind of complex change. Rather the Democrats called for more of the same—especially more farms to raise the families in the traditional style. More land is needed for that, Democrats said, so they pushed for expansion south and west. Jackson conquered Florida for the US. Over intense Whig opposition, his political heir, James Polk (1844–48) added Texas, the Southwest, California, and Oregon. Next on the Democratic agenda would be Cuba.|$|E
2500|$|... "Respect" [...] {{is a song}} {{written and}} {{originally}} released by American recording artist Otis Redding in 1965. The song became a 1967 hit and signature song for R singer Aretha Franklin. The music in the two versions is significantly different, and through a few minor changes in the lyrics, the stories told by the songs have a different flavor. Redding's version is a plea from a desperate man, who will give his woman anything she wants. He won't care if she does him wrong, {{as long as he}} gets his due respect, when he brings money home. However, Franklin's version is a declaration from a strong, confident woman, who knows that she has everything her <b>man</b> <b>wants.</b> She never does him wrong, and demands his [...] "respect". Franklin's version adds the [...] "R-E-S-P-E-C-T" [...] chorus and the backup singers' refrain of [...] "Sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me..." ...|$|E
