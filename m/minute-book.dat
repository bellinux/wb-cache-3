His mouth, which embraced a large cigar, he kept continually screwing round and round and from side to side, as he looked sagaciously and coldly at the strangers.

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{document}} contributions to the early study and teaching of marketing at one of the first universities in Britain to do so and, in that way, to contribute to the literature about the history of marketing thought. Given that the first university business program in Britain was started in 1902, at about the same time as the earliest business programs in America, the more specific {{purpose of this}} paper was to explore whether or not the same influences were shared by pioneer marketing educators on both sides of the Atlantic. Design/methodology/approach An historical method is used including a biographical approach. Primary source materials included unpublished correspondence (letterbooks), lecture notes, seminar <b>minute-books,</b> course syllabi and exams, minutes of senate and faculty meetings, university calendars, and other unpublished documents in the William James Ashley Papers at the University of Birmingham. Findings The contributions of William James Ashley and the Commerce Program at the University of Birmingham to the early twentieth century study and teaching of marketing are documented. Drawing from influences similar to those on pioneer American marketing scholars, Ashley used an historical, inductive, descriptive approach to study and teach marketing as part of what he called “business economics”. Beginning in 1902, Ashley taught his students about a relatively wide range of marketing strategy decisions focusing mostly on channels of distribution and the functions performed by channel intermediaries. His teaching and the research of his students shares much with the early twentieth century commodity, institutional, and functional approaches that dominated American marketing thought. Research limitations/implications William James Ashley was only one scholar and the Commerce Program at the University of Birmingham was only one, although widely acknowledged as the first, of a few early twentieth century British university programs in business. This justifies future research into the possible contributions to marketing knowledge made by other programs such as those at the University of Manchester (1903), University of Liverpool (1910), and University of London (1919). Originality/value This paper adds an important chapter to the history of marketing thought which has been dominated by American pioneer scholars, courses, literature, and ideas...|$|R

It seems likely that the thoroughfare adjacent to the tavern, identified as Apollo Court on John Rocque's Map of London, 1746, was so named because of the tavern, however the name of the tavern seems to have disappeared from the record {{by the end of the}} eighteenth century.|$|E

5000|$|This kind {{negation}} was gratefully received, {{and inserted}} in the <b>minute-book</b> of the congregation. Here, however, the disinterestedness of their pastor did not terminate. That period of famine, so universal throughout Britain, and still well remembered in Scotland as [...] "The Dearth," [...] had reached its height in 1800, so that the middle were now transformed into the lower classes, while the lower were little better than paupers. At this crisis the minister stepped forward with a generous proposal; it was that, in consequence of the prevalent poverty, the amount of his stipend should be reduced. The people, however, {{who were able to}} appreciate his motives, refused to consent, and thus ended a contest that was equally honourable to both.|$|E
5000|$|Burrough had a {{considerable}} {{reputation as an}} architect at the university, where he used his influence to introduce the Classical style which had then become fashionable. Although basically an amateur, he occasionally took a professional fee, as he did for his work at Peterhouse. In 1721 he was added to a syndicate which had been appointed two years before to build the new Senate House. The following year he submitted a [...] "Plan of the Intended Publick Buildings", which, as the <b>minute-book</b> of the syndics records, the architect James Gibbs, who had been consulted, was requested to [...] "take with him to London, and make what improvements he shall think necessary upon it". Gibbs was undoubtedly {{the architect of the}} existing building, the design being engraved in his published work, and Burrough's share in it was probably confined to general suggestions of style and arrangement.|$|E
50|$|This is the {{authentic}} {{history of the}} Kalabaris and any other version given and which does not tally with the Bille position is a fallacy because the people of Kalabari had referred all cases concerning the correct version of their history to the Bille people even in the early thirties. According to palace sources in Bille, {{made available to the}} Press team during the drafting of the memorandum submitted to the State Commission on the Kalabari / Bille Conflict, there are records of visits to Bille by some Kalabari chiefs to request the people of Bille to speak the truth concerning the rightful owners of the kingship of the Kalabari kingdom. Their visits were recorded in a <b>minute-book</b> kept by the Bille king for visitors. As a rule, the Secretary of the Council of Chiefs, usually a non-chief who was however literate, wrote the minutes for the chiefs in those days.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the death}} of Louis Laguerre in 1721 Parmentier {{returned}} to London, hoping to succeed to his practice as a decorative painter. During this London sojourn he {{became a member of}} a masonic music club called the Philo-musicae et -architecturae societas Apollini, which met at the Queen's Head tavern on Fleet Street near Temple Bar. Parmentier may have been hoping that freemasonry might provide a viable source of patronage for him, and it is known that he did get some work through the club, as its <b>minute-book</b> records that when the tavern changed its name to the Apollo tavern in recognition of its musical clientele, Parmentier painted the new sign. He did not, however, achieve his hoped-for success in London, and was on the point of returning to the Netherlands, where he had been invited {{to spend the rest of}} his life with relatives at Amsterdam, when he died on 2 December 1730. He was buried in St Paul's, Covent Garden.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Minute-book</b> of Highgate School {{supplies}} Hewett's date {{of death}} on 25 January 1566/7. Hewett made his will on 3 January 1566/7 requesting burial at St Martin Orgar near his wife. It reveals his extensive engagement with his Hewett and Leveson kin. His principal beneficiaries were Edward Osborne and Anne, and Henry Hewett son of his brother Thomas, all four of whom were his executors. Henry inherited the Three Cranes, with remainder to Thomas and then to Edward. Thomas, a wealthy man in his own right, received a tenement in St Clement's Lane. The Crown in Fenchurch Street (St Dionis Backchurch) devolved to Anne his heir, as did his lands in Wales and manor of Harthill in Yorkshire (excepting a farm to his cousin John Rodes) while the neighbouring farm of Woodsetts was given to Osborne. These became the ancestral heart of the Kiveton Park estates of the Dukes of Leeds. Another important beneficiary was William Hewett, his godson, brother to his said nephew Henry, who received the parsonage of Dunton Bassett in Leicestershire and an estate at Mansfield in Sherwood, Nottinghamshire, as well as £5 annually towards his education at Gray's Inn. This, presumably, was the William Hewett admitted to Gray's Inn on 4 March 1565/6.|$|E
5000|$|As {{early as}} the year 1627 the Portuguese Jews possessed a small place of worship, styled Talmud Torah (תלמוד תורה), {{in the house of}} Elijah Aboab Cardoso. Emperor Ferdinand II {{addressed}} bitter complaints to the senate about this [...] "synagogue", the Catholics not being allowed to build a church in Hamburg at that time. But, in spite of this protest and the violent attacks of the Lutheran clergy, the senate continued to protect the Jews. Their first Ḥacham חכם was Isaac Athias of Venice, whose successor was Abraham Ḥayyim de Fonseca (d. Iyyar, 5411 = 1651), also Ḥacham of another synagogue, Keter Torah (כתר תורה). A further congregation established, named Neveh Shalom (נוה שלום). In 1652 the three Portuguese congregations formally constituted themselves as Holy Community of the Sephardim of Beit Israel (בית ישראל) with a large synagogue of the same name, and chose as chief rabbi ("Ḥacham do naçao") the learned David Cohen de Lara (d. 1674). With him Ḥacham Moses Israel, and, a little later, Judah Carmi were rabbis of the congregation (both died in 1673). In 1656 Isaac Jesurun was called from Venice to Hamburg, there {{to take the place of}} chief rabbi ("Ḥacham geral") [...] [...] [...] [...] "for the promotion of religion and the general welfare," [...] [...] [...] as the oldest <b>minute-book</b> of the congregation says. Apparently offended by this call, Cohen de Lara took leave for a few months and afterward went to live at Amsterdam. After the death of Jesurun (1665), De Lara went back to Hamburg, where he died.|$|E
