40|$|Mechanisms that {{regulate}} intracellular membrane/protein trafficking are of utmost physiological importance. By affecting {{the delivery of}} macromolecules to specific external and subcellular sites they impact majority, if not all relevant cellular processes. Not surprisingly, defects in intracellular membrane flow and its regulators are observed in many pathological conditions, including several neurodegenerative disorders (Howell et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2014). For instance, in Alzheimers’ disease (AD), the most frequent cause of age-related dementia, endo-lysosomal aberrancies followed by consequent defective turnover of autophagic vacuoles {{are one of the}} earliest neuropathological features to develop (Nixon, 2005; Nixon and Yang, 2011). Herein, AD-related and nbsp;associated presenilins (PSEN 1 / 2) may have a two-fold exacerbating contribution. On the one hand, by cleaving amyloid precursor protein (APP) PSENs may facilitate the accumulation of toxic amyloid β (Aβ) species within these internal compartments, thereby compromising their functioning. On the other hand, PSENs (and in particular PSEN 1) have a range of reported functions independent of their primary proteolytic activity. This e. g. includes the increasingly evident roles in endo-lysosomal trafficking of molecules and turnover of autophagic vacuoles, whereby in yet another (more direct) way PSEN dysfunction (as may occur in ageing and AD) could affect these internal compartments. The specific mechanism how this is mediated, however, in big part remains unsettled (reviewed in (Peric and Annaert, 2015)). One of the first accounts on this unconventional role of PSENs (later confirmed by independent sources) emerged from studies of the host laboratory, which demonstrated that PSEN 1 interacts with neuron-specific cell surface localized adhesion protein Telencephalin (TLN), but does not proteolytically process it (Annaert et al., 2001; Esselens et al., 2004). Instead, in PSEN 1 -/- neurons TLN has a delayed turnover (prolonged half-life) and specifically and prominently deposits internally in neuronal soma and dendrites within autophagic-like vacuoles (devoid of APP). While similar TLN-specific accumulations are also noted in wild-type (WT) neurons, lack of PSEN 1 clearly leads to their earlier and much more abundant occurrence. Notably, both human PSEN 1 and its catalytically dead mutant successfully rescue this defect, underscoring that PSEN 1 proteolytic activity does not play a role in this phenomenon (Esselens et al., 2004). Although disturbed turnover of TLN and its specific internal deposition strongly implied an underlying endo-lysosomal trafficking dysfunction, resulting from PSEN deficiency (as in PSEN 1 -/-) or its declining function (as in rdquo; in vitro WT) neurons, the molecular determinants of this deficit remained unknown. Under physiological conditions TLN is primarily found at the somato-dendritic plasma membrane of excitatory neurons, where it prominentlynbsp;to dendritic filopodia, thin (μm-long) protrusions that play a role in development of postsynaptic sites, and hence synaptogenesis. Previously, it has been established that during dendritic filopodia transition (maturation) to spines, TLN undergoes gradual exclusion from the postsynaptic cell surface, and that its selective removal is necessary in this process (Furutani et al., 2007; Matsuno et al., 2006). Specific contribution of endocytic trafficking regulators in this phenomenon, however, has not been evaluated. As regulators of TLN intracellular trafficking likely harbor molecules that may expand our understanding of both PSEN-related trafficking deficits as well as the negative regulatory role of TLN in development of postsynapses, the first objective of this thesis was to identify specific factors involved in endocytic TLN routing and to dissect the trafficking itinerary followed by this protein, starting from its internalization at the plasma membrane. Equipped with the knowledge gained through these studies, we also aimed to examine if and how the identified mediators of TLN endo-lysosomal trafficking functionally interact with this protein in context of spinogenesis. Finally, we also wanted to evaluate their functional relationship with PSENs. Towards the first major objective of this thesis, we identified a small GTPase ARF 6 as an important mediator of TLN internalization and post-endocytic trafficking. Our experiments also revealed that once taken up from the cell surface, TLN follows a route through Rab 5 positive early endosomes, to eventually become sorted towards intralumenal vesicles (ILVs) of the late endosomal multi-vesicular bodies (MVBs), the markers of which we found co-accumulating with TLN in previously reported intra-neuronal autophagic-like vacuoles. Similar colocalization with TLN in endosomes and neuronal accumulations was also shown for the lipid raft marker protein flotillin, which in addition co-distributed with TLN within distinct plasma membrane domains. Overall this suggested that after their internalization at the cell surface, both TLN and flotillin follow a common endocytic route, wherein ARF 6 plays anbsp;function. Our experiments also revealed that ARF 6 -mediated internalization of TLN from dendritic filopodia surface, promotes their maturation to dendritic spines. This resolved the important outstanding question how during dendritic filopodia transition (maturation) to spines, TLN is excluded from the postsynaptic membranes. Thereby, we also addressed the second major objective of this thesis project. All these results were summarized and reported in the EMBO Journal, in a publication on which I share the first authorship (Raemaekers et al., 2012). This study comprises the Chapter III of the present work. Our novel findings that ARF 6 mediates the intracellular routing of TLN, which previously has been show to also require PSEN 1 (Esselens et al., 2004), suggested that ARF 6 and PSEN 1 may be functionally related. To study the cellular interplay between these two proteins, we next switched our focus to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), in which PSEN deficiency, much like in neurons, results in endo-lysosomal transport deficits. We here first examined how ARF 6 and PSENs relate to each other in context of cellular migration (as part of the third major objective of this thesis project). Our experiments revealed that both decreased levels of ARF 6 as well as PSEN deficiency, severely compromise directional persistence of migration of MEF cells. We further show that expression of hPSEN 1, catalytically inactive (hPSEN 1 D 257 A/D 385 A) mutant or hARF 6 (WT or its fast-cycling (T 157 A) mutant) in PSEN deficient MEFs, all successfully rescue this <b>migratory</b> <b>deficit.</b> Taken together, this implied that within the pathway that controls directional migration of MEF cells, PSEN 1 acts independently of its proteolytic function, likely as an upstream modulator of ARF 6. In line, we next demonstrated that this phenomenon (at least in part) may relate to a γ-secretase-independent influence of PSEN 1 on ARF 6 expression, as assessed on protein, mRNA and ARF 6 promoter activity levels. These findings were further confirmed in two additional cell lines (namely N 2 a and HeLa cells), wherein upon genetically ablating PSEN 1 and PSEN 2, we observed congruent drops in ARF 6 expression relative to WT cells in all tested assays. Finally, to identify additional trafficking regulators (affected in a similar way as ARF 6 by the PSEN 1) we performed comparative microarray mRNA profiling of PSEN double deficient MEFs, their hPSEN 1, hPSEN 1 D 257 A/D 385 A rescued and WT counterparts. Subsequent ranking of all genes according to the extent of rescue efficacy (up- or down-regulation in PSENdKOs and a successful expression recovery towards the levels observed in WT cells by both normal and catalytically inactive hPSEN 1), confirmed our previous experimental findings by positioning ARF 6 among the best rescued genes. In addition, this approach also revealed several additional interesting targets (of known involvement in membrane trafficking regulation) the expression of which seems to be prone to regulation by PSEN 1 in a manner independent of its catalytic activity. This includes a few small GTPases of the RAB family, like e. g. Rab 10, which interestingly enough, was recently identified as a novel functional partner of ARF 6 in endocytic recycling (Shi and Grant, 2013). These findings are summarized in the Chapter IV of this thesis. In our two related studies, described in Chapters III and IV of the present work, we identified ARF 6 -regulated endocytic trafficking as annbsp;mediator of synaptogenesis (development of postsynaptic sites) and as well provided a strong support for its contributing role in PSEN-related, γ-secretase-independent endocytic trafficking phenomena. Regarding the well established role of synaptic deficits, endocytic abnormalities and aberrant PSEN-functioning to AD pathogenesis, taken together our findings are hence not only relevant to basic cell biology, but potentially also of importance to mechanisms governing AD progression.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{vertebrate}} organisms, {{the neural}} crest (NC) {{gives rise to}} multipotential and highly migratory progenitors which are distributed throughout the embryo and generate, among other structures, the peripheral nervous system, including the intrinsic neuroglial networks of the gut, i. e. the enteric nervous system (ENS). The majority of enteric neurons and glia originate from vagal NC-derived progenitors which invade the foregut mesenchyme and migrate rostro-caudally to colonise {{the entire length of}} the gut. Although the migratory behaviour of NC cells has been studied extensively, it remains unclear how their properties and response to microenvironment change as they navigate through complex cellular terrains to reach their target embryonic sites. RESULTS: Using conditional gene inactivation in mice we demonstrate here that the cell cycle-dependent protein Geminin (Gem) is critical for the survival of ENS progenitors in a stage-dependent manner. Gem deletion in early ENS progenitors (prior to foregut invasion) resulted in cell-autonomous activation of DNA damage response and p 53 -dependent apoptosis, leading to severe intestinal aganglionosis. In contrast, ablation of Gem shortly after ENS progenitors had invaded the embryonic gut did not result in discernible survival or <b>migratory</b> <b>deficits.</b> In contrast to other developmental systems, we obtained no evidence for a role of Gem in commitment or differentiation of ENS lineages. The stage-dependent resistance of ENS progenitors to mutation-induced genotoxic stress was further supported by the enhanced survival of post gut invasion ENS lineages to γ-irradiation relative to their predecessors. CONCLUSIONS: Our experiments demonstrate that, in mammals, NC-derived ENS lineages are sensitive to genotoxic stress in a stage-specific manner. Following gut invasion, ENS progenitors are distinctly resistant to Gem ablation and irradiation in comparison to their pre-enteric counterparts. These studies suggest that the microenvironment of the embryonic gut protects ENS progenitors and their progeny from genotoxic stress...|$|R
