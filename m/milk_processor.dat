40|$|Dairy {{market in}} Malaysia has been {{increasing}} due to high income and population growth in the region. In response to the increasing demand, <b>milk</b> <b>processors</b> need to obtain constant milk supplies from the dairy farmers.

This paper examines the determinants of relationship quality and its role in enhancing long term relationship between the Malaysian <b>milk</b> <b>processors</b> and dairy farmers. The study revealed that where as mutuality and price satisfaction influence the perceived relationship quality of the farmers positively; dependency and price flexibility do not. Furthermore, the perceived relationship quality of the farmers has a positive influence on long term orientation of the relationship. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{corporate}} {{leadership in}} Kenya Dairy Board is dormant in ensuring linkages between the Government and Public Private Partnership benefits the farmer, small scale <b>milk</b> <b>processors</b> instead leaving big timers in dairy industry to dominate. The recent trend has been towards big processors embarking in buying-out small <b>milk</b> <b>processors.</b> Brookside is on record to have bought-out Ilara Dairy, Spin Knit Dairy, Buzeki Dairy and its tactical disposal of 40 % shareholding {{in favour of}} Banone Company of France. The dairy industry is headed for a monopoly in milk processing if the current trend is anything to go by. This is taking root despite Kippra clearly stating that the sector is un- exploited hence the Government should take this advantage of the poverty- reducing potential of livestock sub-sector. Recommendations over years on ways to revitalize the dairy industry {{with a view to}} empower the producer have never been implemented fully including the lukewarm participation of the market regulator KDB and the Government. The Government has been keen to privatise KCC, which will give private <b>milk</b> <b>processors</b> a leverage to continue dictating the terms of trade in the industry. There is a lot of emphasis on marketing activities of milk products where the farmer has no say or input. This {{is due to the fact}} that farmers are not directly involved in what happens after they struggle to deliver milk to the buyer.

40|$|In Peru, {{strong growth}} in urban demand for industrially {{processed}} dairy products has induced a {{rapid increase in}} milk production along the coast {{but not so much}} in the Andean highlands, where an increase in milk production would create the greatest benefits. A farm–household optimisation model was used to assess the current and changing competitiveness of milk production on the coast (Arequipa and Lima) and in the highlands (Cajamarca). Results show that large farms on the coast, particularly near Lima, are currently the most profitable. However, the high milk prices in Lima are likely to fall because of local market saturation and reduced competition among regional milk buyers. In contrast, milk prices in Arequipa and Cajamarca are expected to rise as a result of increased milk collection by <b>milk</b> <b>processors</b> since <b>milk</b> production costs in these regions are lower and there is a strong incentive to increasingly substitute expensive imported milk powder with locally produced evaporated milk. Improvements in the rural road system and the promotion of agricultural export crops along the coast, particularly in Arequipa, would accelerate the expansion of milk production in the highlands. To improve highland farmers' access to the market, policy makers and development agencies should target their interventions in close collaboration with <b>milk</b> <b>processors.</b> Because they have a strong interest in increasing milk production in their own region, <b>milk</b> <b>processors</b> are also important partners when designing measures to improve farmers' fodder and herd management practices in order to further increase the competitiveness of milk production in the highlands relative to the coast...|$|R

40|$|The {{concentrations}} of airborne dust and bacteria were determined in 12 flax scutching mills {{and in two}} milk processing plants in Normandy, France. A total of 308 of 340 flax workers and 111 of 113 <b>milk</b> <b>processors</b> volunteered to answer a respiratory questionnaire. Personal exposure to airborne dust in the scutching mills varied from 22. 2 mg/m 3 to 144 mg/m 3 and areal concentrations from 8. 92 mg/m 3 to 47. 1 mg/m 3. The concentration of Gram negative bacteria ranged from 3970 (colony forming units) cfu/m 3 to 67, 900 cfu/m 3 and that of total bacteria from 12, 900 cfu/m 3 to more than 600, 000 cfu/m 3.

The corresponding figures among <b>milk</b> <b>processors</b> were 3. 6 % and 4. 5 %. Unexpectedly, only 12. 5 % of the scutchers appeared to suffer from byssinotic symptoms even though they were heavily exposed to airborne dust and bacteria. The low prevalence of byssinosis might be due to self selection of the workforce or a relatively low concentration of the causative agent despite high airborne contamination...|$|R
