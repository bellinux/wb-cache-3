60|$|It {{must have}} {{required}} all the deep and fixed convictions of an ardent temperament, to induce Columbus to rejoice that he had, at length, obtained {{the means of}} satisfying his longings for discovery, when he came coolly to consider what those means were. The names of his vessels, the Santa Maria, the Pinta, and the Niña, have already been mentioned, and some allusions {{have been made to}} their size and construction. Still, it may aid the reader in forming his opinions of the character of this great enterprise, if we give a short sketch of the vessels, more especially that in which Columbus and Luis de Bobadilla were now received. She was, of course, the Santa Maria, a ship of nearly twice the burden of the craft next her in size. This vessel had been prepared with more care than the others, and some attention had been paid to the dignity and comfort of the Admiral she was destined to carry. Not only was she decked in, but a poop, or round-house, was constructed on her quarter-deck, in which he had his berth. No proper notion can be obtained of the appearance of the Santa Maria, from the taunt-rigged, symmetrical, and low-sterned ships of the present time; for, though the Santa Maria had both a poop and top-gallant-forecastle, as they would be termed to-day, neither was constructed in the snug and unobtrusive manner that is now used. The poop, or round-house, was called a castle, to which it had some fancied resemblance, while the top-gallant-forecastle, in which most of the people lived, was out of proportion large, rose like a separate structure on the bows of the vessel, and occupied {{about a third of the}} deck, from forward aft. To those who never saw the shipping that was used throughout Europe, a century since, it will not be very obvious how vessels so small could rise so far above the water, in safety; but this difficulty may be explained; many very old ships, that had some of the peculiarities of this construction, existing within the memory of man, and a few having fallen under our own immediate inspection. The bearings of these vessels were at the loaded water-lines, or very little above them, and they tumbled home, in a way to reduce their beams on their poop decks nearly, if not quite, a fourth. By these precautions, their great height out of the water was less dangerous than might otherwise have been the case; and as they were uniformly short ships, possessing the advantages of lifting easily forward, and were, moreover, low-waisted, they might be considered safe in a sea, rather than the reverse. Being so short, too, they had great beam for their tonnage, which, if not an element of speed, was at least one of security. Although termed ships, these vessels were not rigged in the manner of the ships of the present day, their standing spars being relatively longer than those now in use, while their upper, or shifting spars, were much less numerous, and much less important than those which now point upward, like needles, toward the clouds. Neither had a ship necessarily the same number of spars, in the fifteenth century, as belong to a ship in the nineteenth. The term itself, as it was used in all the southern countries of Europe, being directly derived from the Latin word navis, was applied rather as a generic than as a distinctive term, and by no means inferred any particular construction, or particular rig. The caravel was a ship, in this sense, though not strictly so, perhaps, when we descend to the more <b>minute</b> <b>classification</b> of seamen.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{present a}} method for {{identifying}} patients suffering from the sleep disorder apnea {{on the basis of}} their Electro-Cardiograms (EGCs). The method is a simple algorithm which utilises characteristic features present in the ECG spectrogram. Additionally they describe extensions which enable assessment of whether a subject is experiencing apnea on a minute by minute basis. The authors find that the most informative spectral feature is a previously observed low frequency oscillation at 0. 02 Hz. The oscillation is present during apnea episodes in both the raw ECG signal and also the point process signal formed from the beat times. This indicates that there is a change in the intrinsic dynamics of the system regulating the cardiac cycle heart during apnea episodes. The method was applied to a test set of data provided by Dr Penzel for the `Computers in Cardiology Challenge 2000 ' competition and classified all subjects correctly (30 / 30 = 100 %) and scored 15257 / 17268 = 88 % on the minute by <b>minute</b> <b>classification.</b> Entrant 7 Entry numbers 20000503. 123923 and 20000916. 19393...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We present how {{to perform}} exact {{large-scale}} multi-class Gaus-sian process classification with parameterized histogram intersection ker-nels. In contrast to previous approaches, we use a full Bayesian model without any sparse approximation techniques, which allows for learning in sub-quadratic and classification in constant time. To handle the addi-tional model flexibility induced by parameterized kernels, our approach is able to optimize the parameters with large-scale training data. A key ingredient of this optimization is a new efficient upper bound of the negative Gaussian process log-likelihood. Experiments with image cate-gorization tasks exhibit high performance gains with flexible kernels as well as learning within a few <b>minutes</b> and <b>classification</b> in microseconds for databases, where exact Gaussian process inference was not possible before...|$|R

In this paper, we explore the feasibility of answering questions by asking strangers. In this approach, strangers with potentially useful information are identified by mining the public status updates posted on Twitter, questions are sent to these strangers, and responses are collected. We explore feasibility in two ways: will users respond to questions sent by strangers and, if they do respond, how long must we wait for a response? Our results from asking 1159 questions across two domains suggest that 42 % of users will respond to questions from strangers. 44 % of these responses arrived within 30 <b>minutes.</b> ACM <b>Classification</b> Keywords H 5. m.

40|$|Objective: To {{test the}} {{feasibility}} of a classification system developed to record the contents of treatment sessions intended to improve mobility and self-care by persons with a spinal cord injury (SCI) in clinical rehabilitation. Design: Descriptive study. Setting: Three Dutch SCI facilities. Participants: Participants (N = 36) {{as well as physical}} therapists (n = 20), occupational therapists (n = 14), and sports therapists (n = 2). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Questionnaires to assess the clarity of the classification system, time needed to record 1 treatment session, and the distribution of categories and interventions. The classification system consisted of 28 categories at 3 levels of functioning: basic functions (eg, muscle power), basic activities (eg, transfers), and complex activities (eg, walking and moving around outside). Results: Therapists used 1625 codes to record 856 treatment sessions of 142 patients. For 93 % of the treatment sessions, the coding caused little or no doubt. The therapists were able to classify 86. 3 % of the treatment sessions within 3 <b>minutes.</b> The <b>classification</b> system was rated as useful and easy to use. Conclusions: The findings support the suitability of our classification system as a tool to record the contents of SCI treatment sessions in different settings and by different therapists...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the structure-to-function relationship, life sciences researchers and biologists need to retrieve similar structures from protein databases and classify {{them into the}} same protein fold. With the technology innovation the number of protein structures increases every day, so, retrieving structurally similar proteins using current structural alignment algorithms may take hours or even days. Therefore, improving the efficiency of protein structure retrieval and classification becomes an important research issue. In this paper we propose novel approach which provides faster <b>classification</b> (<b>minutes)</b> of protein structures. We build separate Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for each class.

40|$|Abstract: Defect {{categorization}} is {{the basis}} of many works that relate to software defect detection. The assumption is that different subjects assign the same category to the same defect. Because this assumption was questioned, our following decision was to study the phenomenon, in the aim of providing empirical evidence. Because defects can be categorized by using different criteria, and the experience of the involved professionals in using such a criterion could affect the results, our further decisions were: (i) to focus on the IBM Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC); (ii) to involve professionals after having stabilized process and materials with students. This paper is concerned with our basic experiment. We analyze a benchmark including two thousand and more data that we achieved through twenty-four segments of code, each segment seeded with one defect, and by one hundred twelve sophomores, trained for six hours, and then assigned to classify those defects in a controlled environment for three continual hours. The focus is on: Discrepancy among categorizers, and orthogonality, affinity, effectiveness, and efficiency of categorizations. Results show: (i) training is necessary to achieve orthogonal and effective classifications, and obtain agreement between subjects, (ii) efficiency is five <b>minutes</b> per defect <b>classification</b> in the average, (iii) there is affinity between some categories. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{effectiveness}} of speech contents for detecting clinical depression in adolescents. We also evaluated the performances of acoustic features such as Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), short time energy (Energy), zero crossing rate (ZCR) and Teager energy operator (TEO) using Gaussian mixture models for depression detection. A clinical data set of speech from 139 adolescents, including 68 (49 girls and 19 boys) diagnosed as clinically depressed, {{was used in the}} classification experiments. Each subject participated in three 20 <b>minutes</b> interactions. The <b>classification</b> was first performed using the whole data and a smaller sub-set of data selected based on behavioural constructs defined by trained human observers (data with constructs). In the experiments, we found that the MFCC+Energy feature out performed the TEO feature. The results indicated that using the construct based speech contents in the problem solving interactions (PSI) session improved the detection accuracy. Accuracy was further improved by 4 % when the gender dependent depression modelling technique was adopted. By using construct based PSI session speech content, gender based depression models achieved 65. 1 % average detection accuracy. Also, for both types of features (TEO and MFCC), the correct classification rates were higher for female speakers than for male speakers. 1...|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately, not {{everyone}} at Princeton agreed with Richardson’s method of cataloging. His system, {{often referred to}} as the “Princeton System” relied on whole numbers and <b>minute</b> specifications for <b>classification,</b> resulting in a lengthy cataloging number. And, after many years of service to the Princeton University faculty, staff and students, Richardson was confronted with a group of opposing faculty, who believed that Richardson was not properly performing his duties and that funds were being disposed of inefficiently. A committee was formed to investigate this accusations, of which Richardson was cleared, and it was recommended that the school give the library more funds. This positive opinion did not last, and J.T. Gerould was appointed librarian and the new position of director was created for Richardson without a salary increase. Tensions grew when Richardson traveled abroad and was docked part of his salary, even though he carried out work for the library and had always been compensated previously. To make matters worse, Gerould changed Richardson’s “Title-a-Bar” and “Princeton System” to “Full-form” cataloging and the “Library of Congress System,” while Richardson was abroad. Conflicts between Gerould and Richardson continued and, in 1925, Richardson retired from Princeton and accepted an offer from the Library of Congress as an Honorary Consultant in Bibliography.|$|R
500|$|Stage 5, {{with its}} summit finish at Abetone, was also {{won by a}} rider from a breakaway, this time Jan Polanc (...) , who {{attacked}} on the final climb and won {{by more than a}} <b>minute.</b> The general <b>classification</b> favourites attacked on the final climb; Contador was the first to attack and was followed by Aru and Porte. They were then joined by Mikel Landa, Aru's teammate, and gained time over all the other riders. Clarke lost over two minutes to Contador, Aru and Porte; he therefore lost the lead in the general classification and Contador became the new leader of the race, two seconds ahead of Aru and twenty ahead of Porte. Contador's lead came under threat the following day. The stage was won by Greipel in a sprint finish, but there was a large crash in the final metres. This was caused by a spectator who was leaning over the crash barriers with a camera; Daniele Colli (...) collided with him and caused a large number of riders to crash behind him. Contador was among the riders to crash; although he finished the stage on the same time as Greipel, he was treated for a shoulder injury by his team doctor and was unable to put on the leader's jersey on the podium. Despite suffering from the injury, Contador started and finished the following day's stage. This was won in a sprint finish by Diego Ulissi (Lampre-Merida), while Contador retained the race lead.|$|R
60|$|Plates {{are given}} of the {{principal}} varieties of patterns, having regard only to their more fundamental differences, and names are attached {{for the convenience of}} description; specimens are also given of the outlines of the patterns in all the ten digits of eight different persons, taken at hazard, to afford a first idea of the character of the material to be dealt with. Another and less <b>minute</b> system of <b>classification</b> under three heads is then described, which is very useful for rough preliminary purposes, and of which frequent use is made further on. It is into Arches, Loops, and Whorls. In the Arches, there is no pattern strictly speaking, for there is no interspace; the need for it being avoided by a successive and regular broadening out of the ridges as they cross the bulb of the finger. In Loops, the interspace is filled with a system of ridges that bends back upon itself, and in which no one ridge turns through a complete circle. Whorls contain all cases in which at least one ridge turns through a complete circle, and they include certain double patterns which have a whorled appearance. The transitional cases are few; they are fully described, pictured, and classified. One great advantage of the rude A. L. W. system is that it can be applied, with little risk of error, to impressions that are smudged or imperfect; it is therefore very useful so far as it goes. Thus it can be easily applied to my own finger prints on the title-page, made as they are from digits that are creased and roughened by seventy years of life, and whose impressions have been closely clipped in order to fit them into a limited space.|$|R
5000|$|Haque, in {{his attempt}} to apply the anthropometric system {{originally}} proposed by Francis Galton, got frustrated in terms of its practical application. He soon, according to Bevan, [...] "began to work on a classification system of his own borrowing elements of Galton's." [...] He devised a mathematical formula of sorting slips in 1024 pigeonholes in thirty-two columns and thirty-two rows based on fingerprint patterns. [...] "Its use required no math and no measurements." [...] Beavan further writes, [...] "By 1897, Haque had collected 7000 fingerprint sets in his cabinet. His simple methods of further subclassification, which were easier to learn and less prone to error than Galton's, meant that even a collection numbering in the hundreds of thousands could be divided into small groups of slips. As he predicted, his fingerprint sets, compared with anthropometric cards, were far less prone to error and could be classified and searched with much greater confidence. The registration of a convict or a search for his existing card took an hour under the anthropometric system, but only five <b>minutes</b> using Haque's <b>classification</b> of fingerprints." [...] Bevan goes on to say, [...] "Haque's boss, Edward Henry, was overjoyed with Haque's results, and Henry saw that they would reflect well on him and career. He asked the colonial government to convene a committee to evaluate the system for widespread use. The committee reported that fingerprints were superior to anthropometry [...] "1. In simplicity of working; 2. In the cost of apparatus; 3. In the fact that all skilled work is transferred to a central or classification office; 4. In the rapidity with which the process can be worked; and 5. In the certainty or results. Fingerprints, in other words, were the new hero in criminal identification." [...] (Bevan, page 142) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{absence of}} {{comparative}} validity studies has prevented researchers from reaching consensus regarding {{the application of}} intensity-related accelerometer cut points for children and adolescents. PURPOSE This study aimed to evaluate the classification accuracy of five sets of independently developed ActiGraph cut points using energy expenditure, measured by indirect calorimetry, as a criterion reference standard. METHODS A total of 206 participants {{between the ages of}} 5 and 15 yr completed 12 standardized activity trials. Trials consisted of sedentary activities (lying down, writing, computer game), lifestyle activities (sweeping, laundry, throw and catch, aerobics, basketball), and ambulatory activities (comfortable walk, brisk walk, brisk treadmill walk, running). During each trial, participants wore an ActiGraph GT 1 M, and VO 2 was measured breath-by-breath using the Oxycon Mobile portable metabolic system. Physical activity intensity was estimated using five independently developed cut points: Freedson/Trost (FT), Puyau (PU), Treuth (TR), Mattocks (MT), and Evenson (EV). Classification accuracy was evaluated via weighted κ statistics and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). RESULTS Across all four intensity levels, the EV (κ = 0. 68) and FT (κ = 0. 66) cut points exhibited significantly better agreement than TR (κ = 0. 62), MT (κ = 0. 54), and PU (κ = 0. 36). The EV and FT cut points exhibited significantly better classification accuracy for moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activity (ROC-AUC = 0. 90) than TR, PU, or MT cut points (ROC-AUC = 0. 77 - 0. 85). Only the EV cut points provided acceptable classification accuracy for all four levels of physical activity intensity and performed well among children of all ages. The widely applied sedentary cut point of 100 counts per <b>minute</b> exhibited excellent <b>classification</b> accuracy (ROC-AUC = 0. 90). CONCLUSIONS On the basis of these findings, we recommend that researchers use the EV ActiGraph cut points to estimate time spent in sedentary, light-, moderate-, and vigorous-intensity activity in children and adolescents.
