50|$|General {{elections}} {{was held}} in Mauritius on 15 September 1991. Three main parties gained seats in this election: the Militant Socialist Movement, Mauritian Militant Movement and the Labour Party. The MSM formed an alliance with the MMM and the Labour party formed an alliance with the <b>Mauritian</b> <b>Social</b> Democrat <b>Party</b> (PMSD). On 17 September 1991, results showed that MSM-MMM won 57 seats out of 60 elected seats. This gave 95% of seats to MSM-MMM leader Anerood Jugnauth and 5% to Labour Party-PMSD leader Navin Ramgoolam.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, {{he and the}} MSM joined {{hands with}} the Mauritian Labour <b>Party</b> and <b>Mauritian</b> <b>Social</b> Democrat <b>Party</b> and formed a {{coalition}} known as Ptr-MSM-PMSD which won the parliamentary elections. President Sir Anerood Jugnauth {{on the advice of}} Navin Ramgoolam then appointed him as Vice Prime Minister & Minister of Finance taking office as from 11 May 2010. Ion 26 July 2011, he resigned from his office of minister as well as all other MSM Ministers due to a scandale involving one of the MSM ministers.|$|R
50|$|A general {{election}} {{was held in}} Mauritius on 5 May 2010. The coalition comprising Mauritius Labour Party under Navin Ramgoolam, the Militant Socialist Movement under Pravind Jugnauth and the <b>Mauritian</b> <b>Social</b> Democrat <b>Party</b> under Xavier Luc Duval, won a majority with 41 seats in the parliament. The Mauritian Militant Movement-led coalition under Paul Berenger finished second with 18 seats. The Mauritian Solidarity Front won one seat and the Rodrigues Movement won the two remaining seats. The elections were the ninth to be held since independence from the United Kingdom in 1968.|$|R
50|$|He then {{created his}} own party known as the PMXD which was {{dissolved}} in 2009 to merge with the <b>Mauritian</b> <b>Social</b> Democrat <b>Party.</b> He was then elected leader of the party. His party was in alliance with the Labour Party in 2005 and 2010. Due to the alliance between the Labour Party and MMM in 2014 elections, he resigned as minister on 6 June 2014 and aligned with the MSM to form the Alliance Lepep which then won a landslide victory. He was since then appointed as Deputy Prime Minister.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Mauritian</b> <b>Social</b> Democrat <b>Party</b> has 4 MPs and {{the leader}} Xavier-Luc Duval is also Vice Prime Minister. The party has been kept for ethnic {{representation}} as alone the labour and MSM have absolute majority by 41 seats on 69. The Labour Party is an aristocratic movement headed by mostly Hindus and the MSM is a Vaish dominant party which competes for the Hindu vote. Having two parties with Hindu majority was not perceived as representing the whole population and ethnic minorities. The Social Democrats, which is a Christian majority party, has therefore paved its way to form part of the government.|$|R
5000|$|General {{elections}} {{were held in}} Mauritius on 21 August 1983. The result was a victory for an alliance of the Militant Socialist Movement, the Labour <b>Party</b> and the <b>Mauritian</b> <b>Social</b> Democrat <b>Party,</b> which between them won 46 seats. The Militant Socialist Movement (MSM) won 32 seats, whilst the Labour Party secured 9 seats and PMSD five. This alliance allowed Jugnauth to continue as Prime Minister while bringing Seewoosagur Ramgoolam and Gaetan Duval back into the government after their severe defeat in the 1982 elections. Shortly after, Ramgoolam was appointed as Governor General, Duval became Deputy Prime Minister and Satcam Boolell (new leader of the labour Party) became Minister of Foreign Affairs.|$|R
5000|$|The Alliance Sociale, a {{coalition}} {{led by the}} Mauritian Labour Party (PTr) and including the Mauritian Party of Xavier-Luc Duval (PMXD), the <b>Mauritian</b> <b>Social</b> Democrat <b>Party</b> (MSN), Les Verts (Greens), the Republican Movement, and the Mauritian Militant Socialist Movement (MMSM), won the election with 42 of the 70 seats (38 elected directly, and another 4 nominated under the country's [...] "best loser" [...] system). The PTr leader, Navin Ramgoolam, was subsequently appointed Prime Minister on 5 July, with Rashid Beebeejaun as his deputy. Three other coalition leaders were elected, but the Les Verts leader failed to oust outgoing Prime Minister Paul Bérenger from his constituency.|$|R
5000|$|Charles Gaëtan Xavier Luc Duval [...] (born 28 January 1958) is a Mauritian {{politician}} who was Deputy Prime Minister of Mauritius {{in the cabinet}} of Sir Anerood Jugnauth from December 2014 to December 2016. He was also Minister of Tourism & External Communications and serves as 1st Member of Parliament elected from Constituency No 18 Belle Rose & Quatres Bornes. He {{is the leader of}} the <b>Mauritian</b> <b>Social</b> Democrat <b>Party</b> (PMSD), which was a minority party in the Alliance Lepep. After the PMSD left the government on 19 December 2016, Xavier-Luc Duval was appointed as the leader of the opposition by the President. His party, the PMSD, has 11 MPs, and he succeeded Paul Berenger.|$|R
5000|$|The Mauritius Labour <b>Party,</b> the <b>Mauritian</b> <b>Social</b> Democrat <b>Party</b> (PMSD) and the Militant Socialist Movement (MSM) {{formed an}} electoral {{coalition}} called Alliance de L'avenir (Alliance of the Future) for this election. Ramgoolam, the alliance leader, allotted 35 seats {{to his own}} party {{to compete for the}} 60 seats on the island, whereas the MSM was given 18 and the PMSD 7. Before the election, it appeared that Berenger might gain back the PM's post that he held from 2003 to 2005; he was the first prime minister since independence that was not of South Asian origin. [...] Berenger led his own alliance of parties, known as the Alliance du Coeur (Alliance of the Heart), a reference to the official logo of the Mauritian Militant Movement, by far the biggest party in that alliance. Parties based in Rodrigues compete for the two remaining seats, with the Rodrigues People's Organisation and the Rodrigues Movement being the main parties there.|$|R
50|$|The 1976 {{elections}} were contested by {{three of the}} most popular candidates on the island.These were the Independent Party IP, an alliance of the Mauritian Labor Party, led by the Prime Minister, Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, and the Muslim Action Committee; <b>Mauritian</b> <b>Social</b> Democrat <b>Party</b> (PMSD) led by Gaëtan Duval; and the Mauritian Militant Movement (MMM) led by Paul Bérenger and Anerood Jugnauth himself. About 460 100 voters of the 0.8 million inhabitants of Mauritius registered, and 88% (404 918) of them actually voted. The election was closely fought, and no party was able to gain a majority of parliamentary seats (see 1976 Legislative Assembly election results). The MMM received most votes, 38.64%, but gained only 34 seats, two short of an absolute majority. The Independence Party (MLP and CAM) gained 37.90% and 28 seats, while the PMSD received 16.20% of the votes and eight seats. By once more forming a coalition with the PMSD, Ramgoolam managed to stay in power, but with a majority of only two seats in the Assembly.|$|R
50|$|Founded in 1956 by Jules Koenig, the <b>Mauritian</b> <b>Social</b> Democratic <b>Party</b> {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} parties in the country. It was known as the Mauritian Union from 1946 to 1956. After the post-colonial era, the PMSD was led by Sir Gaetan Duval from 1967 to 1995. The PMSD is known as the only {{political}} party which did not agree to independence for Mauritius. It started out with a large following in the minority communities such as Christians and Muslims, but with the arrival of the MMM in the 1970s, it faded. It won 23 seats in the 1967 general elections; at the 1976 elections, it retained only 7 (plus an eighth indirectly elected member). In 2000 the party formed part of the historical MSM/MMM alliance as a minority party. It joined the Labour Party-led Social Alliance, which included other allies. In 2009, it merged with the Xavier Duval Mauritian Party and retained its name; however, Xavier Luc Duval became leader and Maurice Allet became president. The PMSD is now focused with the Mauritian Creole community and has long been a loyal ally of the Mauritian Labour Party. In the elections of 2014, however, it joined the Alliance Lepep, a coalition comprising the Militant Socialist Movement, the Muvman Liberater, and itself. It won eleven seats.|$|R
50|$|Elections in 1947 for {{the newly}} created Legislative Assembly marked Mauritius' first steps toward self-rule. The Assembly was elected among adult knowing to write. It was won by the Labour Party Headed by Guy Rozemont. It {{is the first time}} the elite Franco was ousted out of power. An {{independence}} campaign gained momentum after 1961, when the British agreed to permit additional self-government and eventual independence. A coalition composed of the Mauritian Labour Party (MLP), the Muslim Committee of Action (CAM) of Sir Abdool Razack Mohamed, and the Independent Forward Bloc (IFB)--a traditionalist Hindu party—won a majority in the 1967 Legislative Assembly election, despite opposition from Franco-Mauritian and Creole supporters of Gaetan Duval's and Jules Keoing's <b>Mauritian</b> <b>Social</b> Democratic <b>Party</b> (PMSD). The contest was interpreted locally as a referendum on independence. The election was won by a small margin. The constituency No. 15 was capital to the winning of the pro-independence coalition. The MLP led alliance was able to win this constituency only due to the support of the C.A.M. of Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, MLP leader and chief minister in the colonial government, became the first prime minister after independence, on March 12, 1968. This event was preceded by a period of communal strife, brought under control with assistance from British troops.|$|R
40|$|With this {{important}} {{collection of essays}} on the independent economic activities of slaves, freedmen, and indentured Indians in colonial Mauritius, Richard Allen takes the history of Mauritian labor well beyond the familiar themes of exploitation and resistance. This is careful economic history from below, with important implications for <b>Mauritian</b> <b>social</b> and cultural history. Allen s argument is that inhabitants of the vast bottoms of the social pyramid gens de couleur (free persons of color), ex-apprentices, and Indian immigrants not only shaped their own destinies in difficult legal and social conditions, but that their independent choices profoundly influenced the insular economy as a whole. Through attention to subalterns acquisition and management of land and capital, Allen sheds new light on key questions in <b>Mauritian</b> <b>social</b> history (especially the social disappearance of the Afro-Mauritian population {{and the rise of}} Indian entrepreneurship {{in the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries). As do all provocative and well-researched works, this one proposes solutions to old problems and allows us to ask new questions about the roles of Malagasy, Africans, Indians, and their descendants in Mauritian history. ...|$|R
