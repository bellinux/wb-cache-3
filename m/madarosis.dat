50|$|In many leprosy cases, <b>madarosis</b> is {{a symptom}} or a quality after diagnosis. However, in India, leprosy is common and {{researchers}} report a case of <b>madarosis</b> before diagnosis of leprosy with no skin lesions, only <b>madarosis.</b> This allowed for quicker treatment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Madarosis</b> {{is not a}} {{critical}} or severe condition. The main symptom and sign of <b>madarosis</b> {{is the loss of}} hair from the eyelids, eyebrows, or eyelashes. Many symptoms are from other diseases involved.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{are being}} {{conducted}} in which <b>madarosis</b> {{can be related}} to malignancy. A study by Groehler and Rose found that there was a statistical significance between these two. They concluded that patients malignancy lesions on the eyelid have a higher chance of having <b>madarosis</b> than a patient with a benign lesion. They stated that {{despite the fact that it}} is significant, the absence of <b>madarosis</b> does not mean the lesion cannot be malignant.|$|E
50|$|<b>Madarosis</b> is {{the loss}} of eyelashes.|$|E
50|$|There {{are various}} causes of <b>madarosis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Dermatologic conditions: {{there are}} {{multiple}} types of dermatological conditions that can result in <b>madarosis.</b> These include Atopic dermatitis, Seborrhoeic dermatitis atopic dermatitis, and Psoriasis on the eyelids can result in <b>madarosis.</b> Others include: frontal fibrosing alopecia, ulerythema ophryogenes, acne rosacea, telogen effluvium, follicular mucinosis,and cutaneous sarcoidosis.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Madarosis</b> is a {{condition}} that results {{in the loss of}} eyelashes, sometimes eyebrow. The term [...] "madarosis" [...] is Greek for the word [...] "madao" [...] which means [...] "to fall off." [...] It originally was a disease of only losing eyelashes but it currently is the loss of both eyelashes and eyebrows. Eyebrows and eyelashes are both important in the prevention of bacteria and other foreign objects from entering the eye. A majority of patients with <b>madarosis</b> have leprosy, and it was reported that 76% of patients with varying types of leprosy had <b>madarosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{severity}} of the pre-existing condition determines which type of <b>madarosis</b> occurs.|$|E
5000|$|Trauma: Most trauma {{injuries}} cause <b>madarosis</b> {{from the}} psychological standpoint, known as trichotillomania ...|$|E
5000|$|Dermatologic conditions: {{there are}} {{multiple}} types of dermatological conditions that can result in <b>madarosis</b> dependent on the location. Atopic dermatitis is associated with allergic disorders and affects the lower eyelid. Seborrhoeic dermatitis {{can be seen as}} the scaling of the eyebrows. Loss of eyebrows is commonly seen from both atopic and seborrhoeic dermatitis due to continuous scratching/touching. Psoriasis on the eyelids can result in <b>madarosis.</b> Others include: frontal fibrosing alopecia, ulerythema ophryogenes, acne rosacea, telogen effluvium, follicular mucinosis,and cutaneous sarcoidosis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Madarosis</b> has {{different}} possible treatments {{and can be}} reversed if treated early enough. The treatments for <b>madarosis</b> are completely dependent upon the pre-existing condition. When suffering from blepheritis, antibiotics are used to combat the bacterial infection. People who are suffering from trichotillomania need to seek behavioral and psychological help. Many people look to hair transplant surgeries, especially in non-scarring cases. These surgeries are mainly used as a cosmetic reason rather than a medical one. There are also other treatments {{that can be used}} for cosmetic purposes.|$|E
50|$|According to the 2016 United States census, roughly 3% of the {{population}} suffers from a disease called <b>madarosis,</b> which is a deficiency where individuals cannot grow eyebrows or eyelashes.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two major}} types of classifications of madarosis.The first is labeled as [...] "non-scarring." [...] Non-scarring the hair {{has the ability to}} {{regrowth}} after treatment of the primary disorder. Scarring <b>madarosis</b> is when the hair loss is permanent and can only regrow after cosmetic treatments.|$|E
5000|$|Infections: Unilateral <b>madarosis</b> (only one eye) {{may occur}} in {{tuberculoid}} leprosy from granulomatous infiltration of hair follicles ultimately destroying them. Infections like syphilis by causing a moth-eaten {{appearance of the}} eyebrow hair loss. Viral infections like herpes or HIV can cause scarring of the eyelid, causing loss of hair. Various fungal infections like paracoccidioidomycosis can cause lesions {{and changes in the}} hair locations of the eyelid.|$|E
50|$|A {{main reason}} {{many people have}} <b>madarosis</b> {{is due to the}} {{chemotherapy}} drugs. There was a clinical trial in 2011 that tested an eyelash gel called bimatoprost. This gel enhanced the eyelashes in quantity and thickness. They tested this on 20 breast cancer patients who were undergoing chemotherapy. Results seemed positive, in that the group of people who used the gel had growth of eyelashes after the chemotherapy drugs.|$|E
40|$|<b>Madarosis</b> {{may be a}} {{presenting}} {{feature of}} a number of vision and life-threatening conditions, including herpes zoster, leprosy, HIV/AIDS, trachoma, malignant eyelid tumors, discoid lupus, scleroderma, and hypothyroidism. It may occur via two broad pathogenic pathways: scarring and non-scarring, which indicates the potential for lash re-growth. <b>Madarosis</b> may occur as an isolated finding or together with loss of other body and scalp hair. The etiology of <b>madarosis</b> can be further divided into dermatological, infection, endocrine, neoplastic, drug-related, congenital, and trauma.

Periocular involvement occurs uncommonly and may progress from eyelid erythema to scarring and <b>madarosis.</b> METHODS: Observational case report. RESULT: A case of DLE that presented with <b>madarosis</b> {{alone in the}} absence of preceding skin erythema and scarring. CONCLUSION: Our case demonstrates that DLE may present with <b>madarosis</b> alone {{in the absence of}} a history of preceding erythema and scarring. Discoid {{lupus erythematosus}} should therefore be considered as a differential diagnosis in chronic blepharitis that persists despite usual medical management and eyelid hygiene. Biopsy should be considered in the presence of clinical features such as erythematous scale on the face and alopecia and sent for direct immunofluorescence staining. Dinesh Selva, Celia S.

40|$|Objective: We {{describe}} {{the case of}} a patient with metastatic breast cancer who presented with eyelid margin thickening and <b>madarosis</b> more suggestive of sebaceous cell carcinoma than metastatic disease. Histopathology confirmed metastatic breast adenocarcinoma. Case Report: A 59 -year-old woman with a known history of metastatic breast carcinoma actively enrolled in a clinical trial presented with a thickened right upper eyelid margin with <b>madarosis</b> and without ulceration. Although the possibility of metastasis was considered, a biopsy was performed to ensure the patient did not have a primary eyelid malignancy such as sebaceous cell carcinoma given her immunocompromised state. Histopathology revealed metastatic breast adenocarcinoma. Conclusions: To the authors’ best knowledge, metastatic breast carcinoma presenting as eyelid margin thickening without ulceration has not previously been reported. Eyelid metastasis is rare, and this patient’s clinical presentation was found to be unusual as well. It is important to establish metastatic disease even in a small focus such as the eyelid, as it may alter disease management...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the results of}} reconstruction of large defects in the upper lid using two composite contra-lateral eyelid margin grafts. Methods: This is an interventional case series in which a large full thickness defect of the upper lid was reconstructed in 7 patients using two composite eyelid margin grafts and myocutaneous advancement. The grafts were taken from both eyelids of the contra lateral eye and the final outcome was evaluated. Results: Cosmetic results were achieved in both donor and recipient eyes satisfying to all patients; no graft sloughing was seen. Transient edema, punctate epithelial erosions, lid notching, <b>madarosis</b> and ptosis were seen in the early postoperative period. Conclusion: Reconstruction of a large defect in the upper lid with two composite eyelid-margin grafts is an easy, safe, effective technique with minimal complications...|$|E
40|$|Eyelashes {{serve as}} the eyeball’s barrier, {{shielding}} it from small foreign bodies and irritants and participating in the reflex that closes the eye. 1, 2 They also play an important aesthetic role in the per-ception of beauty, facial expression, and personal interaction 2 —individuals suffering from <b>madarosis</b> report low self-esteem and confidence. 2 Several methods exist to reconstruct eyelashes using head hair from the safe donor area, includ-ing reverse follicular unit grafting, follicular unit strip surgery, or follicular unit extraction (FUE). 3 – 5 Although neck nape hair and finer hairs {{from the sides of}} the head have been used as donor sources, 3 these hairs are usually straight instead of curled, rela-tively rigid, and grow rapidly.

40|$|Abstract Background Leprosy {{still remains}} an {{important}} {{public health problem}} for {{many parts of the}} world. An association of gangrene with leprosy is a rare one & can have a number of causative mechanisms. We present a case with Leprosy & gangrene with positive anti phopholipid antibody titers. Case presentation A 50 -year-old non-diabetic, non-hypertensive lady presented with 2 months history of progressive gangrene of bilateral toes. She was found to have <b>madarosis</b> & hypopigmented, hypoaesthetic macular lesions on the upper limb & thighs. Bilateral ulnar & popliteal nerves were thickened. A skin biopsy of the lesions revealed borderline tuberculoid leprosy, slit skin smears revealed a bacteriological index of 1 +. She did not have any evidence of thromboembolic episode or atherosclerosis. ACLA was positive at presentation & also on another occasion 6 weeks later. ACLAs were of the IgM type on both occasions. Lupus Anticoagulant & β 2 GPI antibody were negative. DOPPLER of the lower limb arteries did not reveal any abnormality. Patient was successfully treated with multi-drug antileprotics & anticoagulants. Conclusion Infectious APLAs should be recognized as a cause of thrombosis in Leprosy.

40|$|Leprosy or Hansen’s {{disease is}} a chronic mildly {{contagious}} granulomatous disease of tropical and subtropical regions caused by the rod shaped bacillus, Mycobacterium leprae. It affects the skin, peripheral nerves in the hands and feet, mucous membrane of nose, throat and eyes. When left untreated, {{it is capable of}} producing various deformities and disfigurements. Aim: To study the ocular involvement in patients with Leprosy under the parameters of age group, sex type and duration of leprosy. To study the different ocular manifestations and identify the potentially sight threatening lesions and provide early management. Methods: This was a prospective study which included 50 cases diagnosed with Hansen’s disease. Detailed history and thorough clinical examination was done. Potentially sight threatening lesions were managed conservatively or surgically. Results: Out of 50 cases of Leprosy, 58 % had ocular involvement and majority were in the age group 21 - 40 years. Ocular involvement was predominantly seen in Lepromatous type with 35 % having ocular lesions. The most common ocular manifestation observed was superciliary <b>madarosis</b> (48 %). Potentially sight threatening lesions accounted for 72. 4 % of which lagophthalmos was common. No cases of blindness seen. Conclusion: Visual impairment is preventable in Leprosy if detected early.

40|$|AbstractAllogeneic hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (HSCT) has evolved {{over the past two}} decades to become the standard of care for hematologic and lymphoid malignancies. Major ocular complications after allogeneic HSCT have been increasing in number and severity. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a major cause of ocular morbidity after allogeneic HSCT. The main objective of this review is to elucidate the ocular complications in patients developing GVHD following HSCT. Ocular complications secondary to GVHD are common and include dry eye syndrome, acquisition of ocular allergy from donors with allergic disorders. Eyelid changes may occur in GVHD leading to scleroderma-like changes. Patients may develop poliosis, <b>madarosis,</b> vitiligo, lagophthalmos, and entropion. The cornea may show filamentary keratitis, superficial punctate keratitis, corneal ulcers, and peripheral corneal melting which may lead to perforation in severe cases. Scleritis may also occur which can be anterior or posterior. Keratoconjunctivis sicca appears to be the most common presentation of GVHD. The lacrimal glands may be involved with mononuclear cell infiltration of both the major and accessory lacrimal glands and decrease in tear production. Severe dry eye syndrome in patients with GVHD may develop conjunctival scarring, keratinization, and cicatrization of the conjunctiva. Therapy of GVHD includes systemic immunosuppression and local therapy. Surgical treatment in refractory cases includes surgical intervention to improve the manifestation of GVHD of the eye. This may include tarsorrhapy, prose lenses, punctal occlusions and corneal transplantation...|$|E
40|$|AIM—To {{describe}} leprosy characteristics, ocular features, {{and type}} of organisms that produce infective corneal ulcers in leprosy patients.  METHOD—The records of all leprosy patients admitted for treatment of corneal ulcers between 1992  and 1997  were reviewed.  RESULTS— 63 leprosy patients, 53  males and 10  females, are described. 16  were tuberculoid and 47  lepromatous. 25  patients had completed multidrug therapy. 10  patients had face patches, eight had type I reaction, and 10  had type II reaction. 43  (68 %) patients had hand deformities. In 54 % of patients pain was absent as a presenting symptom. 19  patients gave a history of trauma. In 15  patients ulcers had also occurred on the other eye, five of them having occurred {{during the study period}} and the rest before 1992.  Of the 68  eyes with corneal ulcers, 28  had <b>madarosis,</b> 34  had lagophthalmos, nine had ectropion, three had trichiasis, six had blocked nasolacrimal ducts, and 39  decreased corneal sensation. In 14  eyes, a previous lagophthalmos surgery had been done. 16  patients were blind at presentation. 32 % of ulcers were located centrally. After treatment only 18 % of the eyes showed visual improvement. Five types of fungus were cultured, two of them rare ocular pathogens.  CONCLUSIONS—Corneal ulcers occur more in males and in the lepromatous group of patients. Decreased corneal sensation, lagophthalmos and hand deformity are closely associated. Indigenous treatment and late presentations were notable in many patients. Visual outcome is not good. There is increased risk of developing an ulcer in the other eye. Fungal corneal ulcers are not uncommon.    Keywords: infectious keratitis; corneal ulcers; lepros...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Collateral {{damage to}} upper eyelid margin during proton beam {{radiotherapy}} (PBR) for choroidal melanoma may cause squamous metaplasia of the tarsal conjunctiva with keratinisation, corneal irritation, discomfort and, rarely, corneal perforation. We evaluated transpalpebral PBR {{as a means}} of avoiding collateral damage to the upper eyelid margin without increasing the risk of failure of local tumour control. METHODS: Retrospective study of consecutive patients who underwent PBR for choroidal melanoma between 1992 and 2007 at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital and the Douglas Cyclotron at Clatterbridge Cancer Centre, UK. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients were included in this study. Mean basal tumour diameter and tumour thickness were 11. 8  mm and 3. 6  mm, respectively. PBR mean beam range and modulation were 26. 5  mm and 16. 9  mm respectively. The eyelid margin was included in the radiation field in 15 (24 %) eyes. The median follow-up was 2. 5  years. Local tumour recurrence developed in 2 (3. 2 %) patients. In these two cases that developed tumour recurrence the transpalpebral treatment did not involve the eyelid margin. Six (9. 5 %) patients died of metastatic disease. No eyelid or ocular surface problems developed in any of the 48 patients who were treated without eyelid rim involvement, while 7 of the 15 patients with unavoidable irradiation of the eyelid rim developed some degree of <b>madarosis.</b> These seven patients all received more than 26. 55 proton Gy to the eyelid margin. Symptoms, such as grittiness occurred in 12 % of 48 patients without eyelid margin irradiation as compared with 53 % of 15 patients whose lid margin was irradiated. CONCLUSIONS: Transpalpebral PBR of choroidal melanoma avoids eyelid and ocular surface complications without increasing failure of local tumour control...|$|E
40|$|O lúpus eritematoso discóide é uma desordem autoimune que geralmente afeta áreas da pele expostas ao sol. A apresentação de lesões palpebrais na ausência de outras anormalidades cutâneas é incomum, sendo o envolvimento da pálpebra {{inferior}} prevalente em apenas 6 % dos pacientes com lúpus eritematoso cutâneo crônico. Relatamos o caso de uma paciente do sexo feminino de 40 anos, com hiperemia, madarose e ulceração na pálpebra inferior do olho esquerdo refratária ao tratamento para blefarite. Inicialmente, outra lesão semelhante havia sido descrita na pálpebra superior do olho direito. No entanto, as biópsias incisionais mostraram-se inconclusivas. Diante de uma lesão migratória palpebral de características semelhantes à primeira, a hipótese clínica de lúpus eritematoso discóide foi aventada e o diagnóstico confirmado por meio de revisão histopatológica. Uma forte suspeita clínica e o reconhecimento precoce podem evitar erros diagnósticos, complicações clínicas e tratamentos inapropriados, como descrito neste caso de lesão palpebral como manifestação primária do lúpus eritematoso discóide. The discoid {{lupus erythematosus}} is an autoimmune disorder which generally affects the sun-exposed skin. Presentation of lesions on the eyelids {{in the absence of}} any other cutaneous abnormality is uncommon and the lower-eyelid involvement is seen in 6 % of patients with cronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus.

As lesões oculares (74, 4 %) tiveram freqüências desiguais (r PURPOSE: To {{determine the}} prevalence of eye lesions in patients with active and non active leprosy who are being accompanied in a reference center. METHODS: The transverse study consisted of ocular examinations {{and the study of}} demographic and clinical-epidemiological data, in the reference center in the city of Rio Branco, AC (Brazil). The study was conducted between October of 2001 and April of 2002. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-four patients were examined, the average age was 41. 9 years, 70. 1 % were males and 29. 9 % females; 73. 6 % were from the urban area, 76. 8 % were of the multibacillary form and 23. 2 % were of the paucibacillary form. Abnormalities of the ocular annexes were observed in 49. 6 % of the patients (n= 126) and of the ocular globe in 39. 4 % (n= 100), the most frequent being hypoesthesia of the cornea, cataract, <b>madarosis,</b> hiperchromic patches, hypolacrimation, and punctate keratitis.
