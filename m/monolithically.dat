25|$|From {{the fall}} of the monarchy in the 9th century to the {{accession}} of the 5th Dalai Lama, the centre of political power in the Tibetan region was not situated in Lhasa. However, the importance of Lhasa as a religious site became increasingly significant as the centuries progressed. It was known as the centre of Tibet where Padmasambhava magically pinned down the earth demoness and built the foundation of the Jokhang Temple over her heart. Islam has been present since the 11th century in what is considered to have always been a <b>monolithically</b> Buddhist culture. Two Tibetan Muslim communities have lived in Lhasa with distinct homes, food and clothing, language, education, trade and traditional herbal medicine.|$|E
500|$|Meghan O'Rouke, Slate Magazines culture {{critic and}} {{advisory}} editor, ultimately found The Kite Runner mediocre, writing, [...] "This {{is a novel}} simultaneously striving to deliver a large-scale informative portrait and to stage a small-scale redemptive drama, but its therapeutic allegory of recovery can only undermine its realist ambitions. People experience their lives {{against the backdrop of}} their culture, and while Hosseini wisely steers clear of merely exoticizing Afghanistan as a <b>monolithically</b> foreign place, he does so much work to make his novel emotionally accessible to the American reader that there is almost no room, in the end, for us to consider for long what might differentiate Afghans and Americans." [...] Sarah Smith from The Guardian thought the novel started out well but began to falter towards the end. She felt that Hosseini was too focused on fully redeeming the protagonist in Part III and in doing so created too many unrealistic coincidences that allowed Amir the opportunity to undo his past wrongs.|$|E
2500|$|Jarmakani {{argues that}} because of the {{dominant}} representation of Arab women given by the Bush administration many individuals in western societies have an orientalist point of view, have Islamophobia and believe that Arab feminism cannot exist.The reason for this is because the Bush administration led the, [...] "invasion of Afghanistan, as a project of liberation meant to save Afghan women from the oppression of the Taliban," [...] this did not allow for the idea that there could be Arab feminism. Jarmakani explains that US based Feminist Majority Foundation has taken on the role of savior instead of fighting with Arab feminists for issues that they believed were important topics {{that need to be addressed}} in their communities. This coupled with the invasion led to, [...] "reify stereotypical notions of Arab and Muslim womanhood as <b>monolithically</b> oppressed. They depend on a set of U.S. cultural mythologies about the Arab and Muslim worlds, which are often promulgated through overdetermined signifiers, like the “veil” (the English term collapsing a range of cultural and religious dress expressing modesty, piety, or identity, or all three)". She then concludes {{that because of}} the symbols that are used to reinforce this they, [...] "threaten to eclipse the creative work of Arab American feminists. Because the mythologies are so pervasive, operating subtly and insidiously on the register of “common sense,” Arab American feminists are often kept oriented toward correcting these common misconceptions rather than focusing on our own agendas and concerns." [...] Because of these symbols, Arab women are placed in a paradox where, “ the marker (supposedly) of invisibility and cultural authenticity, renders Arab and Muslim womanhood as simultaneously invisible and hypervisible” because the veil is seen as a form of oppression and becomes well known in the western societies as an oppressive form therefore it brings hypervisibility to these women.|$|E

50|$|A Rigid-frame {{bridge is}} a bridge {{in which the}} {{superstructure}} and substructure are rigidly connected {{to act as a}} continuous unit. Typically, the structure is cast <b>monolithically,</b> making the structure continuous from deck to foundation. The connections between members are rigid connections which transfer bending moment, axial forces, and shear forces. A bridge design consisting of a rigid frame can provide significant structural benefits, but can also be difficult to design and/or construct.|$|E

50|$|The deck is {{connected}} <b>monolithically</b> {{with the two}} piers, forming a portal frame, and rests on neoprene bearings at the abutments. The deck is a single-cell box 14 m wide, whose depth varies between 3.5 and 2.1 m between the piers and central areas or near abutments.The piers, with a single shaft in their full height, are made of reinforced concrete. Some of the piers reach 40 m in height. The pylon coincides with the pier axis under the box girder. Pylon is 15 m high and has rectangular cross-section linearly variable.|$|E
50|$|The use of rigid-frame bridges {{began in}} Germany {{in the early}} twentieth century and quickly spread to the Americas. Emílio Henrique Baumgart and Arthur G.

At the time, reinforced concrete was commonly used in bridge design but the superstructure was designed with bearings on the substructure. In concrete rigid-frame design, there are no bearings. Instead the superstructure is cast <b>monolithically</b> with the substructure and the entire bridge from deck to footing is continuous.|$|E
50|$|But {{this was}} not a {{practice}} the artist used in all his paintings from this period, and it is indeed in sharp contrast with The Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence, another depiction of human suffering Titian was completing {{at the same time he}} was working on the Crucifixion. Whereas the Crucifixion has a simple layout, The Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence is a complex—almost baroque—composition. Although the use of colour, light and contrast in the Martyrdom has some obvious similarities with the Crucifixion, it makes no use of any plan of <b>monolithically</b> coloured forms to convey any of its message or gravity.|$|E

50|$|Polarization and {{radiation}} pattern reconfigurability, and frequency tunability, are usually achieved by incorporation of III-V semiconductor components, such as SPST switches or varactor diodes. However, these components {{can be readily}} replaced by RF MEMS switches and varactors {{in order to take}} advantage of the low insertion loss and high Q factor offered by RF MEMS technology. In addition, RF MEMS components can be integrated <b>monolithically</b> on low-loss dielectric substrates, such as borosilicate glass, fused silica or LCP, whereas III-V compound semi-insulating and passivated silicon substrates are generally lossier and have a higher dielectric constant. A low loss tangent and low dielectric constant are of importance for the efficiency and the bandwidth of the antenna.|$|E

50|$|Commercial EDWA {{development}} efforts intensified in 2000's when Inplane Photonics joined the race. In general, their approach {{was similar to}} that of Bell Labs, i.e. the silica-on-silicon technology. Inplane Photonics, however, was able to further improve and expand capabilities of this technology by integrating two to three different waveguide types on the same chip. This feature allowed them to <b>monolithically</b> integrate gain blocks (active waveguides providing amplification) with different passive elements, such as couplers, arrayed waveguide gratings (AWG), optical taps, turning mirrors and so on. Some of advanced Inplane Photonics' photonic circuits containing EDWAs were used by Lockheed Martin in their development of new high-speed on-board communication systems for the US Air Force. Inplane Photonics and its technology was later acquired by CyOptics.|$|E
50|$|Built in 1992, {{the bridge}} was the first {{cable-stayed}} road bridge in Greece. A technical challenge during the design and the construction phase was the extremely slender (L/480) longitudinally and transversally pre-stressed concrete deck with only 45 cm constant thickness, providing sufficient stiffness to abandon any longitudinal girder. The multi-strand stay-cables therefore have a closer spacing of app.5 m with a minimum inclination of 23 degrees and were directly used to support the free cantilever formworks during deck construction. For purpose of higher seismic performance, the concrete deck is <b>monolithically</b> connected with the towers. Constrained reaction due to temperature rise can be handled well due to the slender towers and the soft superstructure. At the transition piers at the bridge ends hinged tension pendulum members are used to transfer uplift forces into the substructure.|$|E
50|$|A {{waffle slab}} foundation, also called a ribbed slab foundation, is an {{above-ground}} type of foundation {{used to provide}} load-bearing capacity in expansive, rocky or hydro collapsible soils. The foundation is created by placing a series of single-use plastic forms set directly on grade to create a grid of ribs, and then <b>monolithically</b> pouring a post tensioned, rebar or Fiber reinforced concrete slab, usually 4 to 8 inches thick between the ribs. Sometimes, expanded polystyrene blocks are used instead of plastic forms, to prevent creating an air space under the slab. The monolithic pour creates concrete beams running throughout the footprint and perimeter of the foundation, with voids between, in one operation. The completed slab then sits on the ground bearing on the ribs created between the forms. The void areas underneath the slab allow for soil movement.|$|E
50|$|The {{other method}} is quasi-phase-matching. In this method the {{frequencies}} involved are not constantly locked in phase with each other, instead the crystal axis is flipped at a regular interval Λ, typically 15 micrometres in length. Hence, these crystals are called periodically poled. This {{results in the}} polarization response of the crystal to be shifted back in phase with the pump beam by reversing the nonlinear susceptibility. This allows net positive energy flow from the pump into the signal and idler frequencies. In this case, the crystal itself provides the additional wavevector k = 2π/Λ (and hence momentum) to satisfy the phase-matching condition. Quasi-phase-matching can be expanded to chirped gratings to get more bandwidth and to shape an SHG pulse like it is done in a dazzler. SHG of a pump and self-phase modulation (emulated by second-order processes) of the signal and an optical parametric amplifier can be integrated <b>monolithically.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} {{may explain}} the confusion between Mid-Acts dispensationalism and Acts 28 ultradispensationalism. Early ultradispensationalism (Acts 28 dispensationalism), such as that promoted by Sir Robert Anderson and E. W. Bullinger emphasized a dispensational boundary line at Acts 28:28, but did not apply this boundary line to the Pauline Epistles. Unlike Bullinger, Anderson posited a Pentecostal dispensation during the period covered by the Book of Acts. Bullinger exposits the Pauline epistles as a whole {{whether or not they}} were written before or after Acts 28:28 in almost all his writings. Bullinger thus had not applied his Acts 28 position consistently to his exposition of Paul's epistles until later in life and then in one book. Thus most all of his books which were already published along with the writings of Sir Robert Anderson exposit Paul's epistles <b>monolithically</b> and are then quite compatible with Mid-Acts hyperdispensationalism.|$|E
