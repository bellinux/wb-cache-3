40|$|Knowledge {{regarding}} the kinetics of metastatic tumor formation, {{as related to}} the growth of the primary tumor, represents a fundamental issue in cancer biology. Using an in vivo mammalian model, we show here that one can obtain useful information from the frequency distribution of the sizes of metastatic colonies in distant organs after serial sectioning and image reconstruction. To explain the experimental findings, we constructed a biophysical model based on the respective growth patterns of the primary tumor and metastases and a stochastic process of <b>metastatic</b> <b>colony</b> formation. Heterogeneous distributions of various biological parameters were considered. We found that the elementary assumption of exponential forms of growth for the primary tumor and metastatic colonies predicts a linear relation on a log-log plot of a <b>metastatic</b> <b>colony</b> size distribution, which was consistent with the experimental results. Furthermore, the slope of the curve signifies the ratio of growth rates of the primary and the metastases. Non-exponential (Gompertzian and logistic) tumor growth patterns were also incorporated into the theory to explain possible deviation from the log-log linear relation. The observed metastasis-free probability also supported the assumption of a time-dependent Poisson process. With this approach, we determined the mechanistic parameters governing the process of metastatogenesis in the lungs for two murine tumor cell lines (KHT and MCaK). Since biological parameters specified in the model could be obtained in the laboratory, a workable metastatic "assay" may be established for various malignancies and in turn contribute in formulating rational treatment regimens for subclinical metastases.

40|$|Suppression of neo-angiogenesis is a {{clinically}} used anti-tumor {{strategy with}} new targets such as angiopoietin- 2 (Ang 2) being proposed. However, {{the functions of}} Ang 2 in vascular remodeling, inflammation and tumor growth are not consistent. We examined effect of depletion of host Ang 2 on liver colony formation using Ang 2 deficient (Ang 2 (-/-)) mice. Surprisingly, the metastatic colonies formed in Ang 2 (-/-) mice were larger {{than those in the}} wild type. These colonies had greater vascular density with more pericyte coverage than the vessels in liver colonies in the wild type. Liver VEGF concentration in both genotypes was equivalent, and thus, the differences appeared VEGF independent. However, after colony formation, the serum concentration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and CXCL 1 in Ang 2 (-/-) mice was 12 and 6 times greater than after colony formation in wild type. Increase of these two cytokines was associated with two times greater numbers of neutrophils recruited to the liver. Two times more Tie 2 +/CD 11 b+/CD 31 - cells were present in the tumors in Ang 2 (-/-) than in the wild type livers. These results suggest that the depletion of host Ang 2 induced compensatory VEGF-independent angiogenic mechanisms and thus enhanced liver <b>metastatic</b> <b>colony</b> growth and colony vascularity. They further indicate organotypic differences in response to tumor metastasis. In contrast, Ang 2 deficiency inhibited tumor growth during <b>metastatic</b> <b>colony</b> formation in the lung, consistent with the reports of decreased pulmonary seeding of tumor cells after pharmacological inhibition of Ang 2.

40|$|Abstract Background TGFβ {{signaling}} has typically {{been associated}} with suppression of tumor initiation while the role it plays in metastasis is generally associated with progression of malignancy. However, we present evidence here for an anti-metastatic role of TGFβ signaling. Methods To test the importance of TGFβ signaling to cell survival and metastasis we compared human colon carcinoma cell lines that are either non-tumorigenic with TGFβ response (FET), or tumorigenic with TGFβ response (FETα) or tumorigenic with abrogated TGFβ response via introduction of dominant negative TGFβRII (FETα/DN) {{and their ability to}} metastasize. Metastatic competency was assessed by orthotopic transplantation. <b>Metastatic</b> <b>colony</b> formation was assessed histologically and by imaging. Results Abrogation of TGFβ signaling through introduction of a dominant negative TGFβ receptor II (TGFβRII) in non-metastatic FETα human colon cancer cells permits metastasis to distal organs, but importantly does not reduce invasive behavior at the primary site. Loss of TGFβ signaling in FETα-DN cells generated enhanced cell survival capabilities in response to cellular stress in vitro. We show that enhanced cellular survival is associated with increased AKT phosphorylation and cytoplasmic expression of inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family members (survivin and XIAP) that elicit a cytoprotective effect through inhibition of caspases in response to stress. To confirm that TGFβ signaling is a metastasis suppressor, we rescued TGFβ signaling in CBS metastatic colon cancer cells that had lost TGFβ receptor expression due to epigenetic repression. Restoration of TGFβ signaling resulted in the inhibition of <b>metastatic</b> <b>colony</b> formation in distal organs by these cells. These results indicate that TGFβ signaling has {{an important role in the}} suppression of metastatic potential in tumors that have already progressed to the stage of an invasive carcinoma. Conclusions The observations presented here indicate a metastasis suppressor role for TGFβ signaling in human colon cancer cells. This raises the concern that therapies targeting inhibition of TGFβ signaling may be imprudent in some patient populations with residual TGFβ tumor suppressor activity. </p...|$|E

We utilized a high-resolution time-lapse intravital imaging approach to visualize the dynamics of cancer cell extravasation in vivo. During intravascular migration, cancer cells form protrusive structures identified as invadopodia by their enrichment of MT 1 -MMP, cortactin, Tks 4, and importantly Tks 5, which localizes exclusively to invadopodia. Cancer cells extend invadopodia through the endothelium into the extravascular stroma prior to their extravasation at endothelial junctions. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of invadopodia initiation (cortactin), maturation (Tks 5), or function (Tks 4) resulted in an abrogation of cancer cell extravasation and <b>metastatic</b> <b>colony</b> formation in an experimental mouse lung metastasis model.

The tumor microenvironment {{is known to be}} essential for metastatic growth, yet identification of plausible targets for cancer therapy in the microenvironment has proven elusive. We found that human colorectal cancer liver metastases and murine gastrointestinal experimental liver metastases are infiltrated by neutrophils. Plasticity in neutrophils has recently been shown to lead to both pro- and anti- tumor effects. Here, neutrophils promoted the growth of hepatic metastases, as depletion of neutrophils in already established, experimental, murine liver metastases led to diminished metastatic growth. Decreased growth was associated with reductions in vascular density and branching suggestive of vessel normalization Metastasis-associated neutrophils expressed substantially more FGF 2 than naïve neutrophils indicating neutrophil polarization by the tumor microenvironment. Administration of FGF 2 neutralizing antibody to mice bearing experimental liver metastases phenocopied neutrophil depletion by reducing liver <b>metastatic</b> <b>colony</b> growth, vascular density and branching.

40|$|Background: Analysing tumour {{architecture}} for metastatic potential usually {{focuses on}} phenotypic differences due to cellular morphology or specific genetic mutations, but often ignore the cell's {{position within the}} heterogeneous substructure. Similar disregard for local neighborhood structure is common in mathematical models. Methods: We view the dynamics of disease progression as an evolutionary game between cellular phenotypes. A typical assumption in this modeling paradigm is that {{the probability of a}} given phenotypic strategy interacting with another depends exclusively on the abundance of those strategies without regard local heterogeneities. We address this limitation by using the Ohtsuki-Nowak transform to introduce spatial structure to the go vs. grow game. Results: We show that spatial structure can promote the invasive (go) strategy. By considering the change in neighbourhood size at a static boundary [...] such as a blood-vessel, organ capsule, or basement membrane [...] we show an edge effect that allows a tumour without invasive phenotypes in the bulk to have a polyclonal boundary with invasive cells. We present an example of this promotion of invasive (EMT positive) cells in a <b>metastatic</b> <b>colony</b> of prostate adenocarcinoma in bone marrow. Interpretation: Pathologic analyses that do not distinguish between cells in the bulk and cells at a static edge of a tumour can underestimate the number of invasive cells.

40|$|We {{have shown}} {{recently}} that the hyaluronan receptor, CD 44, and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP- 9) form a complex {{on the surface of}} TA/St mouse mammary carcinoma cells that activates latent transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and is required for tumor invasion. Disruption of the CD 44 /MMP- 9 complex by expression of soluble CD 44 results in the loss of tumor invasiveness and abrogates tumor cell survival in host lung parenchyma following intravenous injection into syngeneic mice. To explore the molecular nature of the survival signals derived from the CD 44 /MMP- 9 complex during the development of tumor metastasis, we investigated the possibility that activation of latent TGF-beta by the CD 44 /MMP- 9 complex is responsible for tumor cell survival in host lung parenchyma. TA 3 cells overexpressing dominant negative soluble CD 44 (TA 3 sCD 44), which compromises native CD 44 function and the ability of TA 3 cells to develop metastases, were transfected with constitutively active or latent TGF-beta 2 and tested for their ability to form tumors in syngeneic mice. Our results demonstrate that expression of the constitutively active, but not the latent, form of TGF-beta 2 rescues TA 3 sCD 44 cells from apoptosis during lung colonization. These observations provide evidence that activation of latent TGF-beta constitutes an event downstream of CD 44 -dependent signals that is required for tumor cell survival and <b>metastatic</b> <b>colony</b> formation.

40|$|Abstract Background Osteosarcoma (OS) is {{the most}} common primary bone tumour in {{children}} and young adults. Despite improved prognosis, metastatic or relapsed OS remains largely incurable and no significant improvement has been observed in the last 20 years. Therefore, the search for alternative agents in OS is mandatory. Results We investigated phospho-ERK 1 / 2, MCL- 1, and phospho-Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin (P-ERM) as potential therapeutic targets in OS. Activation of these pathways was shown by immunohistochemistry in about 70 % of cases and in all OS cell lines analyzed. Mutational analysis revealed no activating mutations in KRAS whereas BRAF gene was found to be mutated in 4 / 30 OS samples from patients. Based on these results we tested the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib (BAY 43 - 9006) in preclinical models of OS. Sorafenib inhibited OS cell line proliferation, induced apoptosis and downregulated P-ERK 1 / 2, MCL- 1, and P-ERM in a dose-dependent manner. The dephosphorylation of ERM was not due to ERK inhibition. The downregulation of MCL- 1 led to an increase in apoptosis in OS cell lines. In chick embryo chorioallantoic membranes, OS supernatants induced angiogenesis, which was blocked by sorafenib and it was also shown that sorafenib reduced VEGF and MMP 2 production. In addition, sorafenib treatment dramatically reduced tumour volume of OS xenografts and lung metastasis in SCID mice. Conclusion In conclusion, ERK 1 / 2, MCL- 1 and ERM pathways are shown to be active in OS. Sorafenib is able to inhibit their signal transduction, both in vitro and in vivo, displaying anti-tumoural activity, anti-angiogenic effects, and reducing <b>metastatic</b> <b>colony</b> formation in lungs. These data support the testing of sorafenib as a potential therapeutic option in metastatic or relapsed OS patients unresponsive to standard treatments. </p...|$|E

The mice {{were divided into two}} groups : one was the control group that was inoculated with colon 26 (5 × 10 ⁴) with untreated non-adherent splenocyte (2 × 10 ⁶) : the other was the OK-AK group that was inoculated with colon 26 cell (5 × 10 ⁴) with OK-AK cell (2 × 10 ⁶). The number of <b>metastatic</b> <b>colonies</b> and wet hepatic weight was significantly reduced in the OK-AK group (32. 8 ± 8. 1, 0. 98 ± 0. 07 g) compared with the control group (171. 0 ± 37. 3, 1. 23 ± 0. 23 g). Also the survival time of mice was significantly improved. These results demonstrate that perioperative adoptive immunotherapy with OK- 432 -induced activated killer cells reduced the development of liver metastases...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} galectin- 3 in metastasis of human breast carcinoma BT 549 cells using the experimental liver metastasis model. Underlying mechanisms were then elucidated using the liver/tumor co-culture and cell culture systems. After intrasplenic injection, galectin- 3 cDNA transfected BT 549 cells (BT 549 gal- 3 wt) formed <b>metastatic</b> <b>colonies</b> in the liver, while galectin- 3 null BT 549 cells (BT 549 par) did not, demonstrating that galectin- 3 enhances metastatic potential. More than 90 % of BT 549 gal- 3 wt cells survived after 24 hours-co-culture with the liver fragments isolated following ischemia treatment. In contrast, {{more than half of}} BT 549 par cells showed metabolic death following co-culture with the liver fragments. When the liver from inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) knockout mice was used, no cytotoxicity to BT 549 par cells was observed. Thus, iNOS exerts cytotoxicity on BT 549 par cells and galectin- 3 can protect against iNOS-induced cytotoxicity. BT 549 gal- 3 wt also exhibited enhanced survival against peroxynitrite (up to 400 μmol/L) in vitro. A single mutation in the NWGR motif of galectin- 3 obliterated both metastatic capability and cell survival, indicating that the antiapoptotic function of galectin- 3 is involved in enhanced metastasis. In conclusion, galectin- 3 enhances the metastatic potential of BT 549 cells through resistance to the products of iNOS, possibly through its bcl- 2 -like antiapoptotic function...|$|R
40|$|Metastasic {{breast cancer}} {{is the leading cause}} of death by {{malignancy}} in women worldwide. Tumor metastasis is a multistep process encompassing local invasion of cancer cells at primary tumor site, intravasation into the blood vessel, survival in systemic circulation, and extravasation across the endothelium to metastasize at a secondary site. However, only a small percentage of circulating cancer cells initiate <b>metastatic</b> <b>colonies.</b> This fact, together with the inaccessibility and structural complexity of target tissues has hampered the study of the later steps in cancer metastasis. In addition, most data are derived from in vivo models where critical steps such as intravasation/ extravasation of human cancer cells are mediated by murine endothelial cells. Here, we developed a new mouse model to study the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying late steps of the metastatic cascade. We have shown that a network of functional human blood vessels can be formed by co-implantation of human endothelial cells and mesenchymal cells, embedded within a reconstituted basement membrane-like matrix and inoculated subcutaneously into immunodeficient mice. The ability of circulating cancer cells to colonize these human vascularized organoids was next assessed in an orthotopic model of human breast cancer by bioluminescent imaging, molecular techniques and immunohistological analysis. We demonstrate that disseminated human breast cancer cells efficiently colonize organoids containing a functional microvessel network composed of huma...|$|R

We evaluated the effect of VEGF 121 /rGel on the growth of metastatic MDA-MB- 231 tumor cells in SCID mice. VEGF 121 /rGel treatment reduced surface lung tumor foci by 58 % compared to controls (means were 22. 4 and 53. 3, respectively; P <. 05) and the mean area of lung colonies by 50 % (210 ± 37 m 2 vs 415 ± 10 m 2 for VEGF 121 /rGel and control, respectively; P <. 01). In addition, the vascularity of metastatic foci was significantly reduced: (198 ± 37 vs 388 ± 21 vessels/mm 2 for treated and control, respectively). Approximately 62 % of <b>metastatic</b> <b>colonies</b> from the VEGF 121 /rGel-treated group had fewer than 10 vessels per colony compared to 23 % in the control group. The VEGF receptor Flk- 1 was intensely detected on the metastatic vessels in the control {{but not in the}} VEGF 121 /rGel-treated group. Metastatic foci present in lungs had a three-fold lower Ki- 67 labeling index compared to control tumors. Thus, the antitumor vascular-ablative effect of VEGF 121 /rGel may be utilized not only for treating primary tumors but also for inhibiting metastatic spread and vascularization of metastases...|$|R
40|$|In {{pancreatic}} cancer, the mutation of c-K-ras is {{a critical}} event of tumor growth and metastasis. 1 We have previously demonstrated a dominant negative effect of N 116 Y on the growth of pancreatic cancer cells. 2 To evaluate the potential of N 116 Y for suppressing the metastatic growth of pancreatic tumor cells, we made a replication-deficient recombinant N 116 Y adenovirus driven by the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) promoter (Ad CEA-N 116 Y). We demonstrated that the expression of N 116 Y, growth inhibition, and apoptotic death induction were all specific to pancreatic cancer cell lines (PCI- 35 and PCI- 43) that were promoter positive, whereas no growth retardation was observed in human embryonic pancreas-derived cell line 1 C 3 D 3 after Ad CEA-N 116 Y infection. We examined the effect of Ad CEA-N 116 Y on the metastatic growth of PCI- 43 colonies in liver, which were generated by tumor injection into the spleen of nude mice. The results showed that Ad CEA-N 116 Y effectively {{reduced the number of}} <b>metastatic</b> <b>colonies</b> without any complication by injecting intrasplenically five days after tumor cell inoculation. Thus N 116 Y can selectively suppress the metastatic growth of pancreatic tumor cell by using the CEA promoter driven adenovirus vector indicating that N 116 Y gene therapy may be potentially useful for the treatment of pancreatic cancer patients with liver micrometastasis...|$|R

40|$|Matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) {{produced}} by colorectal cancer cells {{is a critical}} determinant of metastatic disease progression and an attractive target for antimetastatic strategies to reduce colon cancer mortality. Cellular signaling by cyclic GMP (cGMP) regulates MMP- 9 dynamics in various cell systems, and the bacterial enterotoxin receptor guanylyl cyclase C (GCC), the principle source of cGMP in colonocytes, which is overexpressed in colorectal cancers, inhibits tumor initiation and progression in the intestine. Here, we show that ligand-dependent GCC signaling through cGMP induces functional remodeling of cancer cell MMP- 9 reflected by a compartmental redistribution of this gelatinase, in which intracellular retention resulted in reciprocal extracellular depletion. Functional remodeling of MMP- 9 by GCC signaling reduced the ability of colon cancer cells to degrade matrix components, organize the actin cytoskeleton to form locomotory organelles and spread, and hematogenously seed distant organs. Of significance, GCC effects on cancer cell MMP- 9 prevented establishment of <b>metastatic</b> <b>colonies</b> by colorectal cancer cells in the mouse peritoneum in vivo. Because endogenous hormones for GCC are uniformly deficient in intestinal tumors, reactivation of dormant GCC signaling with exogenous administration of GCC agonists may represent a specific intervention to target MMP- 9 functions in colon cancer cells. The notion that GCC-mediated regulation of cancer cell MMP- 9 disrupts metastasis, in turn, underscores the unexplored utility of GCC hormone replacement therapy in the chemoprevention of colorectal cancer progression...|$|R

Medium conditioned with hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells stimulated {{the growth of}} highly liver-colonising (RAW 117 -H 10) and highly liver- and lung-colonising (RAW 117 -L 17) sublines at higher rates than the poorly metastatic parental line (RAW 117 -P) (H 10 greater than L 17 greater than P). Medium conditioned with lung microvessel endothelial cells selectively stimulated {{the growth of the}} lung-colonising RAW 117 -L 17 subline. Medium conditioned with brain microvessel endothelial cells showed no growth selectivity, and equivalently stimulated the growth of various RAW 117 cell sublines. Medium conditioned with hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells preferentially promoted the migration of the liver-colonising H 10 and L 17 sublines, and medium conditioned with lung endothelial cells differentially stimulated the migration of the lung-colonising L 17 subline; whereas medium conditioned with brain endothelial cells only slightly stimulated the migration of L 17, but not H 10 or P cells. Fractionation of medium conditioned with hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells by DEAE Sephacel anion exchange chromatography revealed that the growth-stimulating activities were clearly separable from migration-stimulating activities. The growth- and migration-stimulating activities released from organ microvessel endothelial cells may be important in determining the ability of RAW 117 cells to selectively form <b>metastatic</b> <b>colonies</b> in particular organs...|$|R
