5|$|The mallard is {{omnivorous}} {{and very}} flexible in its choice of food. Its diet may vary based on several factors, including {{the stage of}} the breeding cycle, short-term variations in available food, nutrient availability, and interspecific and intraspecific competition. The majority of the mallard's diet seems to be made up of gastropods, invertebrates (including beetles, flies, lepidopterans, dragonflies, and caddisflies), crustaceans, worms, many varieties of seeds and plant <b>matter,</b> <b>and</b> roots and tubers. During the breeding season, male birds were recorded to have eaten 37.6% animal <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> 62.4% plant matter, most notably Echinochloa crus-galli, and nonlaying females ate 37.0% animal <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> 63.0% plant matter, while laying females ate 71.9% animal <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> only 28.1% plant matter. Plants generally make up the larger part of a bird's diet, especially during autumn migration and in the winter.|$|E

5|$|Dark <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> {{dark energy}} are the current leading topics in astronomy, as their {{discovery}} and controversy originated {{during the study}} of the galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Each {{particle}} {{of matter}} has a corresponding antimatter particle {{with the opposite}} electrical charge. Thus, the positron is a positively charged antielectron and the antiproton is a negatively charged equivalent of a proton. When a <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> corresponding antimatter particle meet, they annihilate each other. Because of this, along with an imbalance {{between the number of}} <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> antimatter particles, the latter are rare in the universe. The first causes of this imbalance are not yet fully understood, although theories of baryogenesis may offer an explanation. As a result, no antimatter atoms have been discovered in nature. However, in 1996 the antimatter counterpart of the hydrogen atom (antihydrogen) was synthesized at the CERN laboratory in Geneva.|$|E
5|$|Estimates put {{the average}} energy {{density of the}} Universe at the {{equivalent}} of 5.9 protons per cubic meter, including dark energy, dark <b>matter,</b> <b>and</b> baryonic matter (ordinary matter composed of atoms). The atoms account for only 4.6% of the total energy density, or a density of one proton per four cubic meters. The density of the Universe, however, is clearly not uniform; it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies—including very high density in structures within galaxies, such as planets, stars, and black holes—to conditions in vast voids that have much lower density, {{at least in terms}} of visible matter. Unlike the <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> dark matter, the dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies: although dark energy may account for a majority of the mass-energy in the Universe, dark energy's influence is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the influence of gravity from <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> dark matter within the Milky Way.|$|E

5|$|Fundamental to the {{structure}} of the Universe is the existence of dark <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> dark energy.

5|$|Gravitational aggregations {{clustered}} into filaments, leaving voids in the gaps. Gradually, {{organizations of}} gas and dust merged to form the first primitive galaxies.
