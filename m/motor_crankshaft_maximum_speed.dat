5000|$|It was {{on display}} at the November 1923 Paris Salon and struck Flights {{reporter}} as [...] "extremely interesting" [...] and car-engine like in its four cylinder inline arrangement, a little heavy but reliable. It was unusual in its high <b>maximum</b> <b>crankshaft</b> <b>speed</b> of 3,200 rpm and the availability of a choice of reduction gear ratios.|$|R
5000|$|The BMW M12/13 {{turbocharged}} straight-4 {{engine was}} famous during its life {{for being the}} first Formula 1 engine capable of [...] in racing trim, although it was capable of nearly [...] for qualifying with modification of its boost. This engine had a bore and stroke of 89.2 mm x 60.0 mm, giving a displacement of 1,499.79 cc. <b>Maximum</b> <b>crankshaft</b> <b>speed</b> was 11,200 rpm. Peak power b.m.e.p. was {{in the region of}} 1,000 lbs/sq.in.|$|R
40|$|A {{heat pump}} {{developed}} {{for use in}} Spacelab as a stand-alone refrigeration unit as well as within a fluid loop system is discussed. It will provide an active thermal control for payloads. Specifications for the heat pump were established: (1) heat removal rates at the source; (2) heat source temperatures from room temperature; (3) heat-sink fluid temperatures at condenser inlet; and (4) minimum power consumption. A reversed Carnot cycle heat pump using Freon 12 as working fluid incorporating a one-cylinder reciprocating compressor was selected. The <b>maximum</b> <b>crankshaft</b> <b>speed</b> was fixed relatively high at 100 rpm. The specified cooling rates then made it necessary to select a cylinder volume of 10 cu cm, which was obtained with a bore of 40 mm and a stroke of 8 mm...|$|R
25|$|On average, the headway {{between each}} tram {{departure}} is approximately 1.5 minutes during peak hours. In the past, trams had a <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> of 40km/h. However, since early 2008, the <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> of some trams was increased, with a <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> of 50km/h now enabled on most trams - {{a few of}} them even have a <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> of 60km/h.

50|$|Trains on {{the metro}} operate at a <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> of 80 km/h, {{and an average}} speed of 32 km/h. <b>Maximum</b> <b>speed</b> is limited to 42 km/h at curves.|$|R
50|$|Speed is {{generally}} limited to 130-140 km/h, but on most secondary lines actual <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> is significantly lower. On the HSL-Zuid line, the <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> {{is much higher}} at 300 km/h. Technically, more recent lines have been constructed to allow for higher speeds.

40|$|Honors ThesisThe {{thrust of}} this project was to design, build, and test a sled cowling for use on local area roads to reduce the {{aerodynamic}} drag, and therefore increasing speed. Without a cowling, <b>maximum</b> <b>speeds</b> are approximately 40 mph. It is the goal {{of this project}} to compare the <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> of a sledder to the <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> of a sledder within this cowling...|$|R
50|$|Many Class 143 {{locomotives}} were in use {{for passenger}} traffic and on longer Regionalbahn and Regional-Express services, so the <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> of 120 km/h was awkward, {{especially as the}} carriages often had a <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> of 140 or 160 km/h. It was planned to rebuild some locomotives with higher <b>maximum</b> <b>speeds</b> of 140 and 160 km/h, which would be classified as Class 114.3 and Class 114.1 respectively.|$|R
50|$|Most modern {{gearboxes}} {{are used}} to increase torque while reducing {{the speed of a}} prime mover output shaft (e.g. a <b>motor</b> <b>crankshaft).</b> This means that the output shaft of a gearbox rotates at a slower rate than the input shaft, and this reduction in speed produces a mechanical advantage, increasing torque. A gearbox can be set up to do the opposite and provide an increase in shaft speed with a reduction of torque. Some of the simplest gearboxes merely change the physical rotational direction of power transmission.|$|R
