5|$|During the investigation, an {{examination}} of the pylon attachment points revealed damage to the wing's pylon <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> that matched the shape of the pylon's rear attachment fitting. This meant that the pylon attachment fitting had struck the <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> at some point. This was important evidence, as the only way the pylon fitting could strike the wing's <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> in the observed manner was if the bolts that held the pylon to the wing had been removed and the engine/pylon assembly was being supported by something other than the aircraft itself. Hence investigators were able to conclude that the observed damage to the rear pylon mount had been present before the crash, rather than being caused by it.|$|E
5|$|Each module {{was fitted}} with {{external}} components {{specific to the}} experiments that were carried out within that module, the most obvious being the Travers antenna mounted to Priroda. This synthetic aperture radar consisted of a large dish-like framework mounted outside the module, with associated equipment within, used for Earth observations experiments, as was {{most of the other}} equipment on Priroda, including various radiometers and scan platforms. Kvant-2 also featured several scan platforms and was fitted with a <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> to which the cosmonaut manoeuvring unit, or Ikar, was mated.

This engine was rated at a [...] with 2 x 4 barrel Holley carburetors and a solid lifter camshaft. Ford also made available aluminum cylinder heads as a dealer option. The 1963½ was still overweight, however. To be competitive in drag racing Ford produced 212 (around 170 from Ford Norfolk, about 20 from Ford Los Angeles) lightweight versions of the [...] "R" [...] code 427, in the Galaxie 500 Sport Special Tudor Fastback. Available only in Corinthian White with red vinyl interior, and with a list price of about US$4,200 (when a base Ford 300 went for US$2,324, and XL Fastback was US$3,268), these cars came stock with Borg-Warner T-10 four-speed, 4.11:1 rear axle, heavy-duty suspension and brakes, and were fitted with a fiberglass hood (a flat piece at first, late in 1963 the popular blister hood also used on the Thunderbolt), trunk, front fenders, and fender aprons, as well as aluminum bumpers and mounting brackets, transmission cases, and bellhousing. Hood springs, heater, trunk lining and mat, spare wheel and tire (and <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket),</b> trunk lid torsion bar, jack, lug wrench, one horn (of the stock two), armrests, rear ashtrays, courtesy lights, and dome light were removed to reduce weight. The first 20 cars had functional fiberglass doors, which shaved these were deleted because of Ford's concern for safety if used on the highway. The cars had all sound-deadening material removed, lightweight seats and floormats, and no options. They were not factory equipped with cold-air induction, as the Thunderbolt would be. In addition, they were built on the -lighter Ford 300 chassis, originally intended for a smaller-displacement V8. In all, the 427s were [...] lighter than before ( [...] with the fiberglass doors).|$|E

40|$|Engine mounts have an {{important}} function of containing firmly the power-train components of a vehicle. Correct geometry and positioning of the <b>mount</b> <b>brackets</b> on the chassis ensures a good ride quality and performance. As an FSAE car intends to be a high performance vehicle, the brackets on the frame that support the engine undergo high static and dynamic stresses as well as huge amount of vibrations. Hence, dissipating the vibrational energy and keeping the stresses under a pre-determined level of safety should be achieved by careful designing {{and analysis of the}} <b>mount</b> <b>brackets.</b> Keeping this in mind the current paper discusses the modeling, Finite Element Analysis, Modal analysis and mass optimization of engine <b>mount</b> <b>brackets</b> for a FSAE car.
