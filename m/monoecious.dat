5|$|Species {{boundaries}} in plants may be weaker than in animals, and cross species hybrids are often possible. A familiar example is peppermint, Mentha × piperita, a sterile hybrid between Mentha aquatica and spearmint, Mentha spicata. The many cultivated varieties of wheat {{are the result}} of multiple inter- and intra-specific crosses between wild species and their hybrids. Angiosperms with <b>monoecious</b> flowers often have self-incompatibility mechanisms that operate between the pollen and stigma so that the pollen either fails to reach the stigma or fails to germinate and produce male gametes. This is one of several methods used by plants to promote outcrossing. In many land plants the male and female gametes are produced by separate individuals. These species are said to be dioecious when referring to vascular plant sporophytes and dioicous when referring to bryophyte gametophytes.|$|E
5|$|There {{are male}} (staminate) and female (pistillate) flowers (unisexual flowers) {{on a single}} plant (<b>monoecious),</b> and these grow singly, {{appearing}} from the leaf axils. Flowers have five fused yellow to orange petals (the corolla) and a green bell-shaped calyx. Male flowers in Cucurbitaceae generally have five stamens, but in Cucurbita there are only three, and their anthers are joined together so that {{there appears to be}} one. Female flowers have thick pedicels, and an inferior ovary with 3–5 stigmas that each have two lobes. The female flowers of C.argyrosperma and C.ficifolia have larger corollas than the male flowers. Female flowers of C.pepo have a small calyx, but the calyx of C.moschata male flowers is comparatively short.|$|E
5|$|Figs have {{complicated}} inflorescences called syconia. Flowers {{are entirely}} contained within an enclosed structure. Their only {{connection with the}} outside is through a small pore called ostiole. <b>Monoecious</b> figs like F. aurea have {{both male and female}} flowers within the syconium. Female flowers mature first. Once mature, they produce a volatile chemical attractant. Female wasps squeeze their way through the ostiole into the interior of the syconium. Inside the syconium, they pollinate the flowers, lay their eggs in some of them, and die. The eggs hatch and the larvae parasitise the flowers in which they were laid. After four to seven weeks (in F. aurea), adult wasps emerge. Males emerge first, mate with the females, and cut exit holes through the walls of the fig. The male flowers mature around {{the same time as the}} female wasps emerge. The newly emerged female wasps actively pack their bodies with pollen from the male flowers before leaving through the exit holes the males have cut and fly off to find a syconium in which to lay their eggs. Over the next one to five days, figs ripen. The ripe figs are eaten by various mammals and birds which disperse the seeds.|$|E
25|$|The Phytelephantoideae are a <b>monoecious</b> subfamily. Members of {{this group}} have {{distinct}} monopodial flower clusters. Other distinct features include a gynoecium with five to 10 joined carpels, and flowers with more than three parts per whorl. Fruits are multiple-seeded and have multiple parts.|$|E
25|$|Most {{conifers}} are <b>monoecious,</b> {{but some}} are subdioecious or dioecious; all are wind-pollinated. Conifer seeds develop inside a protective cone called a strobilus. The cones take from four months to three years to reach maturity, and vary in size from 2mm to 600mm long.|$|E
25|$|Ragweeds are <b>monoecious,</b> most {{producing}} inflorescences {{that contain}} both staminate and pistillate flowers. Inflorescences {{are often in}} the form of a spike or raceme made up mostly of staminate flowers with some pistillate clusters around the base. Staminate flower heads have stamens surrounded by whitish or purplish florets. Pistillate flower heads have fruit-yielding ovules surrounded by many phyllaries and fewer, smaller florets. The pistillate flowers are wind pollinated, and the fruits develop. They are burs, sometimes adorned with knobs, wings, or spines.|$|E
25|$|Flowering and fruiting- Hickories are <b>monoecious</b> {{and flower}} {{in the spring}} (3). The staminate catkins of pignut hickory are 8 to 18cm (3 to 7 in) long and develop from axils of leaves of the {{previous}} season or from inner scales of the terminal buds {{at the base of}} the current growth. The pistillate flowers appear in spikes about 6mm (0.25in) long on peduncles terminating in shoots of the current year. Flowers open from the middle of March in the southeast part of the range to early June in New England. The catkins usually emerge before the pistillate flowers.|$|E
25|$|The seed cones {{are highly}} modified, each cone {{containing}} a single seed 4–7mm long partly {{surrounded by a}} modified scale which develops into a soft, bright red berry-like structure called an aril, 8–15mm long and wide and open at the end. The arils are mature 6–9 months after pollination. The seeds contained in the arils are eaten by thrushes and other birds, which disperse the hard seeds undamaged in their droppings; maturation of the arils is spread over 2–3 months, increasing the chances of successful seed dispersal. The male cones are globose, 3–6mm diameter, and shed their pollen in early spring. It is mostly dioecious, but occasional individuals can be variably <b>monoecious,</b> or change sex with time.|$|E
25|$|Hornbeams {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} trees, Carpinus betulus reaching {{a height of}} 32m. The leaves are deciduous, alternate, and simple with a serrated margin, and typically vary from 3–10cm in length. The flowers are wind-pollinated pendulous catkins, produced in spring. The male and female flowers are on separate catkins, but on the same tree (<b>monoecious).</b> The fruit is a small nut about 3–6mm long, held in a leafy bract; the bract may be either trilobed or simple oval, and is slightly asymmetrical. The asymmetry of the seedwing makes it spin as it falls, improving wind dispersal. The shape of the wing {{is important in the}} identification of different hornbeam species. Typically, 10–30 seeds are on each seed catkin.|$|E
25|$|The {{flowers are}} unisexual, {{carried on the}} same {{inflorescence}} (i.e. the plant is <b>monoecious).</b> One (or occasionally two) inflorescences emerge from a leaf axil, with at least five inflorescence-bearing axils per fertile branch. The inflorescences have a unique structure among flowering plants. In the centre {{there is a single}} carpellate ("female") flower. This lacks obvious petals or sepals (although there are small bracts below the flower which some researchers have suggested may be the remnants of the perianth), and consists solely of a single-celled (unilocular) ovary, 5mm long by 2mm wide, surmounted by three curved 4mm long stigmas. On either side of the solitary carpellate flower there are two branches each with five or six staminate ("male") flowers arranged at 1–3mm intervals.|$|E
25|$|<b>Monoecious,</b> {{sometimes}} dioecious herbs, shrubs, or {{trees to}} 6m tall. Thorns or other armature absent. Stipules present, sometimes leaf-like is some Meineckia. Petioles present or absent, not pulvinate. leaves simple, arrangement alternate, subopposite, {{or in some}} Poranthera, opposite. margins entire. Inflorescences axillary, or rarely, apparently terminal. Flowers solitary to fasciculate. Sepals free, greenish, persistent. Petals present or absent, often partly adnate to the nectary disk, equal to the sepals or shorter, white or greenish, usually larger in staminate than in pistillate flowers. Disk present, extrastaminal; annular or divided into alternisepalous segments or glands. Stamens opposite the sepals, free or fused for up to 9/10 of their length. Anthers latrorse, at least in bud, opening by longitudinal slits, or in Poranthera, by pores. Ovary usually divided into three locules. Two ovules in each locule. Styles free to almost completely fused. Fruit explosively dehiscent. Seeds usually two per locule; sometimes one in Actephila and Meineckia.|$|E
500|$|Aiphanes {{species are}} pleonanthic—they flower {{repeatedly}} {{over the course}} of their lifespan—and <b>monoecious,</b> meaning that there are separate male and female flowers, but individuals plants bear both types of flowers. In Aiphanes, male and female flowers are borne together on the same inflorescence. [...] Usually only a single inflorescence is borne at each node, although A.gelatinosa often bears then in groups of three at a single node. [...] The inflorescence usually consists of a main axis consisting of a peduncle and a rachis. [...] The rachis bears rachillae, which are smaller branches which themselves bear the flowers, while the peduncle is the main stalk connecting the rachis with the stem of the plant. [...] In some species there is second-order branching—the rachillae themselves are branched and the flowers are borne on these branches.|$|E
500|$|The <b>monoecious</b> (or bisexual) yellow-green {{flowers are}} {{produced}} after the leaves in early summer, in May or June in the British Isles, on pendulous panicles [...] long with about 60–100 flowers on each stalk. The fruits are paired winged seeds or samaras, the seeds [...] in diameter, {{each with a}} wing [...] long developed {{as an extension of}} the ovary wall. [...] The wings are held at about right angles to each other, distinguishing them from those of A. platanoides and A. campestre, in which the wings are almost opposite, and from those of A. saccharum, in which they are almost parallel. [...] When shed, the wing of the samara catches the wind and rotates the fruit as it falls, slowing its descent and enabling the wind to disperse it further from the parent tree. The seeds are mature in autumn about four months after pollination.|$|E
500|$|The {{flowers are}} {{generally}} unisexual, with {{male and female}} flowers appearing in separate sessile clusters, though they are sometimes also bisexual. They appear in spring from April to May (though as early as late January {{in the southern part}} of its range), usually coming before the leaves. The tree itself is considered Polygamodioecious, meaning some individuals are male, some female, and some <b>monoecious.</b> Under the proper conditions, the tree can sometimes switch from male to female, male to hermaphroditic, and hermaphroditic to female [...] The red maple will begin blooming when it is about 8 years old, but it significantly varies between tree to tree: some trees may begin flowering when they are 4 years old. The flowers are red with 5 small petals and a 5-lobed calyx borne in hanging clusters, usually at the twig tips. They are lineal to oblong in shape and are pubescent. The pistillate flowers have one pistil formed from two fused carpels with a glabrous superior ovary and two long styles that protrude beyond the perianth. The staminate flowers contain between 4 and 12 stamens, often with 8.|$|E
500|$|The {{silver birch}} is a {{medium-sized}} deciduous tree, typically reaching [...] tall (exceptionally up to [...] ), with a slender trunk usually under [...] diameter. The bark {{on the trunk}} and branches is golden-brown at first, but later this turns to white {{as a result of}} papery tissue developing on the surface and peeling off in flakes, in a similar manner to the closely related Paper birch (B. papyrifera). The bark remains smooth until the tree gets quite large, but in older trees, the bark thickens, becoming irregular, dark and rugged. Young branches have whitish resin warts and the twigs are slender, hairless and often [...] The buds are small and sticky, and development is sympodial, that is to say the terminal bud dies away and growth continues from a lateral bud. The species is <b>monoecious</b> with male and female catkins found in the same tree. Some shoots are long and bear the male catkins at the tip, while others are short and bear female catkins. The immature male catkins are present during the winter but the female catkins develop in the spring, soon after the leaves unfurl.|$|E
2500|$|The {{species is}} <b>monoecious,</b> with pollen and seed cones {{on the same}} plant. The seed cones are ovoid, [...] long, with 15–25 spirally {{arranged}} scales; pollination is in late winter with maturation about 8–9 months after. Each cone scale bears three to seven seeds, each seed [...] long and [...] broad, with two wings [...] wide. The seeds are released when the cone scales dry out and open at maturity. The pollen cones are ovular and [...] long.|$|E
2500|$|Self-fertilization, {{also known}} as autogamy, occurs in {{hermaphroditic}} organisms where the two gametes fused in fertilization {{come from the same}} individual, e.g., many vascular plants, some foraminiferans, some ciliates. The term [...] "autogamy" [...] is sometimes substituted for autogamous pollination (not necessarily leading to successful fertilization) and describes self-pollination within the same flower, distinguished from geitonogamous pollination, transfer of pollen to a different flower on the same flowering plant, or within a single <b>monoecious</b> Gymnosperm plant.|$|E
2500|$|Figs have {{complicated}} inflorescences called syconia. Flowers {{are entirely}} contained within an enclosed structure. Their only {{connection with the}} outside is through a small pore called ostiole. [...] <b>Monoecious</b> figs like F. maxima have {{both male and female}} flowers within the syconium. [...] Female flowers mature first. Once mature, they produce a volatile chemical attractant which is recognised by female wasps belonging to the species Tetrapus americanus. Female wasps of this species are about [...] long and are capable of producing about 190 offspring.|$|E
2500|$|Glossopteris was a woody, seed-bearing shrub or tree, some {{apparently}} reaching [...] tall. They had a softwood interior {{that resembles}} conifers {{of the family}} Araucariaceae. Seeds were borne {{on one side of}} variably branched or fused structures, and microsporangia containing pollen were borne in clusters at the tips of slender filaments. Both the seed- and pollen-bearing organs were partially fused (adnate) to the leaves, or, in some cases, possibly positioned in the axils of leaves. The homologies of the flattened seed-bearing structures have remained particularly controversial with some arguing that the fertile organs represent megasporophylls (fertile leaves) whereas others have interpreted the structures as flattened, seed-bearing, axillary axes (cladodes). It is unclear whether glossopterids were <b>monoecious</b> or dioecious.|$|E
2500|$|In conifers, the {{reproductive}} structures are borne on cones. The cones are either pollen cones (male) or ovulate cones (female), but some species are <b>monoecious</b> and others dioecious. [...] A pollen cone contains hundreds of microsporangia carried on (or borne on) reproductive structures called sporophylls. Spore mother {{cells in the}} microsporangia divide by meiosis to form haploid microspores that [...] develop further by two mitotic divisions into immature male gametophytes (pollen grains). [...] The four resulting cells consist of a large tube cell that forms the pollen tube, a generative cell that will produce two sperm by mitosis, and two prothallial cells that degenerate. [...] These cells comprise a very reduced microgametophyte, that is contained within the resistant wall of the pollen grain.|$|E
2500|$|Sequoia sempervirens [...] is {{the sole}} living species of the genus Sequoia in the cypress family Cupressaceae (formerly treated in Taxodiaceae). Common names include coast redwood, coastal redwood and California redwood. It is an evergreen, long-lived, <b>monoecious</b> tree living 1,200–1,800 years or more. This species {{includes}} the tallest living trees on Earth, reaching up to [...] in height (without the roots) and up to [...] in diameter at breast height (dbh). These trees are also among the oldest living things on Earth. Before commercial logging and clearing began by the 1850s, this massive tree occurred naturally in an estimated [...] along much of coastal California (excluding southern California where rainfall is not sufficient) and the southwestern corner of coastal Oregon within the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Typha are aquatic or semi-aquatic, rhizomatous, {{herbaceous}} perennial plants. The {{leaves are}} glabrous (hairless), linear, alternate and mostly basal on a simple, jointless stem that bears the flowering spikes. The plants are <b>monoecious,</b> with [...] unisexual flowers that develop in dense racemes. The numerous male flowers form a narrow spike {{at the top}} of the vertical stem. Each male (staminate) flower is reduced to a pair of stamens and hairs, and withers once the pollen is shed. Large numbers of tiny female flowers form a dense, sausage-shaped spike on the stem below the male spike. In larger species this can be up to [...] long and [...] thick. The seeds are minute, [...] long, and attached to fine hairs. [...] When ripe, the heads disintegrate into a cottony fluff from which the seeds disperse by wind.|$|E
2500|$|The {{flowers of}} Cannabis sativa are {{unisexual}} and plants {{are most often}} either male or female. It is a short-day flowering plant, with staminate (male) plants usually taller and less robust than pistillate (female) plants The flowers of the female plant are arranged in racemes and can produce hundreds of seeds. Male plants shed their pollen and die several weeks prior to seed ripening on the female plants. Although genetic factors dispose a plant to become male or female, environmental factors including the diurnal light cycle can alter sexual expression. Naturally occurring <b>monoecious</b> plants, with {{both male and female}} parts, are either sterile or fertile but artificially induced [...] "hermaphrodites" [...] can have fully functional reproductive organs. [...] "Feminized" [...] seed sold by many commercial seed suppliers are derived from artificially [...] "hermaphrodytic" [...] females that lack the male gene, or by treating the plants with hormones or silver thiosulfate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{park has}} the largest {{reserved}} population of black cypress pine (Callitris endlicheri) in Victoria. [...] The native conifer is commonly found in the hilly areas of southeast Australia where the climates are relatively warm and dry. [...] The <b>monoecious</b> species is wind pollinated and described as having mostly erect branches, tough furrowed bark and dark green foliage. The species exhibits strong drought tolerance {{and an ability to}} survive in densely crowded strands though the rate of maturation can be slowed under these conditions. [...] The pine is vulnerable to changes in rainfall and grazing pressure from rabbits and deer. [...] The pine is highly susceptible to fire and mortality usually follows exposure. [...] The Chiltern-Mt Pilot pine population was severely affected by the 2003 Eldorado fire. [...] This places the species at greater risk of local extinction from future fires, particularly if two fires were to occur in close succession.|$|E
2500|$|The word monoicous and {{the related}} forms <b>mon(o)ecious</b> are derived from the Greek mόνος (mónos), single, and οἶκος (oîkos) or οἰκία (oikía), house. [...] The words dioicous and di(o)ecious are derived from οἶκος or οἰκία and δι- (di-), twice, double. ((o)e is the Latin way of transliterating Greek οι, whereas oi is a more {{straightforward}} modern way.) Generally, the terms [...] "monoicous" [...] and [...] "dioicous" [...] have been restricted to description of haploid sexuality (gametophytic sexuality), and are thus used primarily to describe bryophytes in which the gametophyte is the dominant generation. [...] Meanwhile, [...] "monoecious" [...] and [...] "dioecious" [...] are used to describe diploid sexuality (sporophytic sexuality), and thus are used to describe tracheophytes (vascular plants) in which the sporophyte is the dominant generation. However, this usage, although precise, is not universal, and [...] "monoecious" [...] and [...] "dioecious" [...] are still used by some bryologists for the gametophyte.|$|E
2500|$|Pines {{are mostly}} <b>monoecious,</b> having {{the male and}} female cones on the same tree, though a few species are sub-dioecious, with {{individuals}} predominantly, but not wholly, single-sex. The male cones are small, typically 1–5cm long, and only present for a short period (usually in spring, though autumn in a few pines), falling as soon as they have shed their pollen. The female cones take 1.5–3 years (depending on species) to mature after pollination, with actual fertilization delayed one year. At maturity the female cones are 3–60cm long. Each cone has numerous spirally arranged scales, with two seeds on each fertile scale; the scales at the base and tip of the cone are small and sterile, without seeds. The seeds are mostly small and winged, and are anemophilous (wind-dispersed), but some are larger and have only a vestigial wing, and are bird-dispersed (see below). At maturity, the cones usually open to release the seeds, but in some of the bird-dispersed species (e.g. whitebark pine), the seeds are only released by the bird breaking the cones open. In others, the seeds are stored in closed ("serotinous") cones for many years until an environmental cue triggers the cones to open, releasing the seeds. [...] The most common form of serotiny is pyriscence, in which a resin binds the cones shut until melted by a forest fire.|$|E
60|$|Dioecious plants, however fertilised, {{have a great}} {{advantage}} over other plants in their cross-fertilisation being assured. But this advantage is gained {{in the case of}} anemophilous species {{at the expense of the}} production of an enormous superfluity of pollen, with some risk to them and to entomophilous species of their fertilisation occasionally failing. Half the individuals, moreover, namely, the males, produce no seed, and this might possibly be a disadvantage. Delpino remarks that dioecious plants cannot spread so easily as <b>monoecious</b> and hermaphrodite species, for a single individual which happened to reach some new site could not propagate its kind; but it may be doubted whether this is a serious evil. <b>Monoecious</b> plants can hardly fail to be to a large extent dioecious in function, owing to the lightness of their pollen and to the wind blowing laterally, with the great additional advantage of occasionally or often producing some self-fertilised seeds. When they are also dichogamous, they are necessarily dioecious in function. Lastly, hermaphrodite plants can generally produce at least some self-fertilised seeds, and they are at the same time capable, through the various means specified in this chapter, of cross-fertilisation. When their structure absolutely prevents self-fertilisation, they are in the same relative position to one another as <b>monoecious</b> and dioecious plants, with what may be an advantage, namely, that every flower is capable of yielding seeds.|$|E

6000|$|We {{now come}} to our second Class, that of <b>monoecious</b> species, or those which have their sexes {{separated}} but borne on the same plant. The flowers necessarily differ, but when those of one sex include rudiments of the other sex, {{the difference between the}} two kinds is usually not great. When the difference is great, as we see in catkin-bearing plants, this depends largely on many of the species in this, as well as in the next or dioecious class, being fertilised by the aid of the wind; for the male flowers have in this case to produce a surprising amount of incoherent pollen. (Introduction/16. Delpino 'Studi sopra uno Lignaggio Anemofilo' Firenze 1871.) Some few <b>monoecious</b> plants consist of two bodies of individuals, with their flowers differing in function, though not in structure; for certain individuals mature their pollen before the female flowers on the same plant are ready for fertilisation, and are called proterandrous; whilst conversely other individuals, called proterogynous, have their stigmas mature before their pollen is ready. The purpose of this curious functional difference obviously is to favour the cross-fertilisation of distinct plants. A case of this kind was first observed by Delpino in the Walnut (Juglans regia), and has since been observed with the common Nut (Corylus avellana). I may add that according to H. Muller the individuals of some few hermaphrodite plants differ in a like manner; some being proterandrous and others proterogynous. (Introduction/17. Delpino 'Ult. Osservazioni sulla Dicogamia' part 2 fasc 2 page 337. Mr. Wetterhan and H. Muller on Corylus 'Nature' volume 11 page 507 and 1875 page 26. On proterandrous and proterogynous hermaphrodite individuals of the same species, see H. Muller 'Die Befruchtung' etc. pages 285, 339.) On cultivated trees of the Walnut and Mulberry, the male flowers have been observed to abort on certain individuals, which have thus been converted into females; but whether there are any species in a state of nature which co-exist as <b>monoecious</b> and female individuals, I do not know. (Introduction/18. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1847 pages 541, 558.) ...|$|E
60|$|The {{subject of}} the present volume, namely the {{differently}} formed flowers normally produced by certain kinds of plants, either on the same stock or on distinct stocks, {{ought to have been}} treated by a professed botanist, to which distinction I can lay no claim. As far as the sexual relations of flowers are concerned, Linnaeus long ago divided them into hermaphrodite, <b>monoecious,</b> dioecious, and polygamous species. This fundamental distinction, with the aid of several subdivisions {{in each of the four}} classes, will serve my purpose; but the classification is artificial, and the groups often pass into one another.|$|E
6000|$|With {{respect to}} {{dioecious}} plants, distinct individuals must always fertilise each other. With <b>monoecious</b> plants, as pollen {{has to be}} carried from flower to flower, {{there will always be}} a good chance of its being carried from plant to plant. Delpino has also observed the curious fact that certain individuals of the <b>monoecious</b> walnut (Juglans regia) are proterandrous, and others proterogynous, and these will reciprocally fertilise each other. (10/30. 'Ult. Osservazioni' etc. part 2 fasc 2 page 337.) So it is with the common nut (Corylus avellana) (10/31. 'Nature' 1875 page 26.), and, what is more surprising, with some few hermaphrodite plants, as observed by Hermann Muller. (10/32. 'Die Befruchtung' etc. pages 285, 339.) These latter plants cannot fail to act on each other like dimorphic or trimorphic species, in which the union of two individuals is necessary for full and normal fertility. With ordinary hermaphrodite species, the expansion of only a few flowers at the same time is one of the simplest means for favouring the intercrossing of distinct individuals; but this would render the plants less conspicuous to insects, unless the flowers were of large size, as in the case of several bulbous plants. Kerner thinks that it is for this object that the Australian Villarsia parnassifolia produces daily only a single flower. (10/33. 'Die Schutzmittel' etc page 23.) Mr. Cheeseman also remarks, that as certain Orchids in New Zealand which require insect-aid for their fertilisation bear only a single flower, distinct plants cannot fail to intercross. (10/34. 'Transactions of the New Zealand Institute' volume 5 1873 page 356.) ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the case}} of plants Gartner states that he fertilised {{thirteen}} heads (and subsequently nine others) on a dwarf maize bearing yellow seed (16/11. 'Bastarderzeugung' s. 87, 169. See also the Table {{at the end of}} volume.) with pollen of a tall maize having red seed; and one head alone produced good seed, but only five in number. Though these plants are <b>monoecious,</b> and therefore do not require castration, yet I should have suspected some accident in the manipulation, had not Gartner expressly stated that he had during many years grown these two varieties together, and they did not spontaneously cross; and this, considering that the plants are <b>monoecious</b> and abound with pollen, and are well known generally to cross freely, seems explicable only on the belief that these two varieties are in some degree mutually infertile. The hybrid plants raised from the above five seeds were intermediate in structure, extremely variable, and perfectly fertile. (16/12. 'Bastarderzeugung' s. 87, 577.) In like manner Prof. Hildebrand (16/13. 'Bot. Zeitung' 1868 page 327.) could not succeed in fertilising the female flowers of a plant bearing brown grains with pollen from a certain kind bearing yellow grains; although other flowers on the same plant, which were fertilised with their own pollen, yielded good seed. No one, I believe, even suspects that these varieties of maize are distinct species; but had the hybrids been in the least sterile, no doubt Gartner would at once have so classed them. I may here remark, that with undoubted species there is not necessarily any close relation between the sterility of a first cross and that of the hybrid offspring. Some species can be crossed with facility, but produce utterly sterile hybrids; others can be crossed with extreme difficulty, but the hybrids when produced are moderately fertile. I am not aware, however, of any instance quite like this of the maize, namely, of a first cross made with difficulty, but yielding perfectly fertile hybrids. (16/14. Mr. Shirreff formerly thought ('Gardener's Chronicle' 1858 page 771) that the offspring from a cross between certain varieties of wheat became sterile in the fourth generation; but he now admits ('Improvement of the Cereals' 1873) that this was an error.) ...|$|E
60|$|Hildebrand {{has shown}} that with {{hermaphrodite}} plants which are strongly proterandrous, the stamens in the flowers which open first sometimes abort; and this seems to follow from their being useless, as no pistils are then ready to be fertilised. Conversely the pistils in the flowers which open last sometimes abort; as when they are ready for fertilisation all the pollen has been shed. He further shows {{by means of a}} series of gradations amongst the Compositae, that a tendency from the causes just specified to produce either male or female florets, sometimes spreads to all the florets on the same head, and sometimes even to the whole plant (7/5. 'Ueber die Geschlechtsverhaltnisse bei den Compositen' 1869 page 89.); and in this latter case the species becomes dioecious. In those rare instances mentioned in the Introduction, in which some of the individuals of both <b>monoecious</b> and hermaphrodite plants are proterandrous, others being proterogynous, their conversion into a dioecious condition would probably be much facilitated, as they already consist of two bodies of individuals, differing to a certain extent in their reproductive functions.|$|E
60|$|Why the {{descendants}} of plants which were originally dioecious, and which therefore profited by always intercrossing with another individual, should have been converted into hermaphrodites, may perhaps {{be explained by the}} risk which they ran, especially {{as long as they were}} anemophilous, of not being always fertilised, and consequently of not leaving offspring. This latter evil, the greatest of all to any organism, would have been much lessened by their becoming hermaphrodites, though with the contingent disadvantage of frequent self-fertilisation. By what graduated steps an hermaphrodite condition was acquired we do not know. But we can see that if a lowly organised form, in which the two sexes were represented by somewhat different individuals, were to increase by budding either before or after conjugation, the two incipient sexes would be capable of appearing by buds on the same stock, as occasionally occurs with various characters at the present day. The organism would then be in a <b>monoecious</b> condition, and this is probably the first step towards hermaphroditism; for if very simple male and female flowers on the same stock, each consisting of a single stamen or pistil, were brought close together and surrounded by a common envelope, in nearly the same manner as with the florets of the Compositae, we should have an hermaphrodite flower.|$|E
60|$|This {{plant is}} <b>monoecious,</b> and was {{selected}} for trial on this account, no other such plant having been experimented on. (6/8. Hildebrand remarks that this species seems at first sight adapted to be fertilised by pollen from the same plant, owing to the male flowers standing above the female flowers; but practically it must generally be fertilised by pollen from another plant, as the male flowers usually shed their pollen before the female flowers are mature: 'Monatsbericht der K. Akad.' Berlin October 1872 page 743.) It is also anemophilous, or is fertilised by the wind; and of such plants only the common beet had been tried. Some plants were raised in the greenhouse, and were crossed with pollen taken from a distinct plant; and a single plant, growing quite separately in {{a different part of}} the house, was allowed to fertilise itself spontaneously. The seeds thus obtained were placed on damp sand, and as they germinated in pairs of equal age were planted on the opposite sides of four very large pots; nevertheless they were considerably crowded. The pots were kept in the hothouse. The plants were first measured to the tips of their leaves when only between 1 and 2 feet in height, as shown in Table 6/97.|$|E
60|$|Finally, we {{have seen}} {{reason to believe that}} the higher plants are descended from {{extremely}} low forms which conjugated, and that the conjugating individuals differed somewhat from one another,--the one representing the male and the other the female--so that plants were aboriginally dioecious. At a very early period such lowly organised dioecious plants probably gave rise by budding to <b>monoecious</b> plants with the two sexes borne by the same individual; and by a still closer union of the sexes to hermaphrodite plants, which are now much the commonest form. (10/63. There is a considerable amount of evidence that all the higher animals are the descendants of hermaphrodites; and it is a curious problem whether such hermaphroditism may not have been the result of the conjugation of two slightly different individuals, which represented the two incipient sexes. On this view, the higher animals may now owe their bilateral structure, with all their organs double at an early embryonic period, to the fusion or conjugation of two primordial individuals.) As soon as plants became affixed to the ground, their pollen must have been carried by some means from flower to flower, at first almost certainly by the wind, then by pollen-devouring, and afterwards by nectar-seeking insects. During subsequent ages some few entomophilous plants have been again rendered anemophilous, and some hermaphrodite plants have had their sexes again separated; and we can vaguely see the advantages of such recurrent changes under certain conditions.|$|E
