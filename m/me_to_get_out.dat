500|$|Heffron, humiliated {{and tired}} after several decades in ministerial office, {{resigned}} as Premier {{six months later}} on 30 April 1964 {{at the age of}} 73. His announcement came as a surprise to many members of his own party, although there had been existing hints in the previous months that the Labor caucus had been discussing a departure plan for Heffron, to be replaced by the Deputy Premier Renshaw. Heffron insisted that he had made the decision to himself a year prior, declaring: [...] "It was purely my own decision, so I cannot complain about anyone throwing me out or advising <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out.</b> Sometimes we are advised to get out – there are hints, but we don't take any notice when they come from outside, {{but it is not the}} same, of course, as coming from your own party." [...] Renshaw succeeded him as Premier. On 24 June 1964, Heffron was granted by Queen Elizabeth II retention of the title [...] "The Honourable" [...] for having served for more than three years as a Member of the Executive Council of New South Wales.|$|E

But Disney {{expressed}} interest, with Lucas saying [...] "It's better for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> {{at the beginning of a}} new thing and I can just remove myself. The time is more important to me than the money." ...|$|E
2500|$|Del Toro has {{expressed}} interest in a sequel, saying, [...] "I think we would all come back to do a third Hellboy, if they can wait for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of Middle-Earth, but we don't know. Ron may {{want to do it}} sooner, but I certainly know where we're going with the movie on the third one." [...] On May 30, 2010, Guillermo del Toro dropped out of directing The Hobbit.|$|E

2500|$|Ginsberg {{received}} a letter from his mother after her death responding to a copy of [...] "Howl" [...] he had sent her. It admonished Ginsberg to be good and stay away from drugs; she says, [...] "The key is in the window, the key is in the sunlight at the window – I have the key – Get married Allen don't take drugs – the key is in the bars, in the sunlight in the window". In a letter she wrote to Ginsberg's brother Eugene, she said, [...] "God's informers come to my bed, and God himself I saw in the sky. The sunshine showed too, a key {{on the side of the}} window for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out.</b> The yellow of the sunshine, also showed the key on the side of the window." [...] These letters and the absence of a facility to recite kaddish inspired Ginsberg to write [...] "Kaddish" [...] which makes references to many details from Naomi's life, Ginsberg's experiences with her, and the letter, including the lines [...] "the key is in the light" [...] and [...] "the key is in the window".|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, thanks, I am {{sure he is}} all right," [...] I {{answered}} (for {{nothing in}} the world would have induced <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of bed {{while he was in the}} room). [...] "Do you object to a cigarette?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's it--tommy rot," [...] {{answered}} Alan, {{who was not}} superstitious. [...] "Well, I {{suppose that}} we must go through with it. But oh! Jeekie, I wish you would tell <b>me</b> how <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of this." ...|$|R
40|$|Five years ago, when I {{returned}} to school for my master’s degree, I had never used a Window’s program. Today, I compose spreadsheets, set up databases, and do {{a great deal of}} research online utilizing remote access to libraries. The work that I have done has provided me with the exposure to possibilities I had never dreamed of before. Technology has forced <b>me</b> <b>to</b> stretch; <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of my comfort zone. ...|$|R
60|$|I {{had seen}} Mr. Guppy {{bringing}} in papers and arranging them for Mr. Kenge; {{and he had}} seen me and made me a forlorn bow, which rendered <b>me</b> desirous <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the court. Richard had given me his arm and was taking me away when Mr. Guppy came up.|$|R

60|$|Presently I became {{certain that}} my {{instincts}} had not deceived me, for I heard the quick {{sound of a}} bicycle bell. This was odd, for surely no one would ring for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the way. Then there was another tinkle, a little nearer.|$|E
6000|$|Now, my Lady Marchioness, I've {{thought it}} {{my duty to}} [...] tell you all this because I don't {{like to see a}} noble [...] family put upon. There isn't nothing for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> [...] of it myself. But I do it just as one of the family's [...] well-wishers. Therefore I sign myself your very [...] respectful, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shore. Leave it <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of camp, anyhow. That {{conceited}} hombre, Lee Stanton, will {{be riding}} in here," [...] answered Flo, laconically.|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{that you}} have to do," [...] wrote Casanova in answer, [...] "is to break through the ceiling of my cell and <b>get</b> me <b>out</b> of this, then trust <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> you <b>out</b> of the Piombi. If you are {{disposed}} to make the attempt, I will supply you with the means, and show you the way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That foolishness in the Legislature, as {{you call}} it, {{represented}} a sentiment all over the State," [...] said Hilary. [...] "And if I'd been you, I wouldn't have let Hunt in this year. But you didn't ask my opinion. You asked me when you begged <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Adam <b>out,</b> and I predicted that he wouldn't get out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wal, y'u all can back me up," [...] replied Blue, dubiously. [...] "Y'u see, my plan goes {{as far as}} killin' Jorth--an' mebbe his brothers. Mebbe I'll get a {{crack at}} Queen.

Mebbe it 'll be easy fer <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out.</b> An' if I do y'u fellars will know it an' can fill thet {{storeroom}} full of bullets." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Finch--with {{his whole}} {{attention}} fixed on Oscar--wrung my hand mechanically, and said I was a [...] "good creature;" [...] {{much as he}} might have patted, and spoken to, Oscar's companion, if the companion had been a dog. I almost wished myself that animal for the moment--I should have {{had the privilege of}} biting Mr. Finch. Oscar impatiently repeated my question; the rector, at the time, officiously assisting him to descend from the carriage, and leaving <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> as I could.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, captain. That twenty napoleons {{may help}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of an English prison. I will manage a hiding place for them. And now I think, captain, {{we will be}} off at once--at least {{as soon as we}} have had our dinner. It's a good long way across the island to where that {{schooner}} was lying, and I shall have to choose a place for my fire {{so that it can be}} seen from the top of the hill." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anderson left Stargate SG-1 {{because he}} wanted {{to spend more time with}} his daughter, stating, [...] "Being a father, well, I don't know if this is a change, but it makes <b>me</b> want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of here faster. Get off the clock. Just 'cause the baby is my reason for living, my reason for coming to work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If you can't <b>get</b> it <b>out,</b> ma'am,' said Bounderby, 'leave <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it <b>out.</b> This {{is not a}} {{time for}} a lady, however highly connected, to be totally inaudible, and {{seemingly}} swallowing marbles.

5000|$|Marc Nix of IGN {{criticized the}} {{characters}} for {{their lack of}} unique abilities, and wrote, [...] "Collecting four pairs of sunglasses on each level, such as {{is the driving force}} in Men In Black 2, isn't enough reason for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> even <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of bed." [...] U.K. magazine Total Game Boy criticized the graphics, the repetitive gameplay, and the difficulty.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} major, good-humoredly. [...] "I am simply the man driving the lighter and more easily-managed team for pleasure, and he's the man driving the heavier and more {{difficult}} machine for work. It's for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of his way; and looked at {{in the light of}} my being THE LANDLORD it is still worse, for as we're working 'on shares' I'm interrupting HIS work, and reducing HIS profits merely because I choose to sacrifice my own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Confound it,' {{he muttered}} angrily, 'he must have slipped out {{at one of}} the other {{stations}} without my noticing him. It must have been at Vauxhall, just as those four men were pushing past <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out.</b> I am a nice sort of fellow to take up the amateur detective business. To hunt for a man for nearly three weeks and then when I have found him to lose him again like this. I will go across and see Danvers. Of course he will have the laugh against me. Well, I can't help that; I will take his advice about it. I am evidently not fit to manage by myself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just that. What are {{my chances}} of getting away now?" [...] he asked her. [...] "Was there ever such infernal luck as mine? The Telemachus will sail without me, and the only man who could and would have helped <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of this damned country is under arrest. It's clear I shall have to shift for myself again, and I can't even do that {{for a day or}} two with my leg in this state. I shall have to go back into that stuffy store-cupboard of yours till God knows when." [...] He lost all {{self-control}} at the prospect and broke into imprecations of his luck.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't let us judge her harshly, my dear: we don't {{know what}} serious {{necessity}} may not plead her excuse. It is plain {{that she can}} trust nobody--and that she only consented <b>to</b> see <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> you <b>out</b> {{of the room and}} spare you the pain of parting. Compose yourself, Blanche. I don't despair of discovering where she has gone, if you will help me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, he hasn't," [...] cried Corrie, eagerly. [...] "That's it, that's {{just the}} point; he has saved {{more than he}} ever took away, and he's sorry for what he has done; yet they're going to hang him. Now, I say, that's sinful-- it's not just. It shan't be done if I can prevent it; and you must help <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> him <b>out</b> of this scrape--you must indeed, Dick Price." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{set out to}} swim instinctively, {{the life}} {{preserver}} holding him up, although {{it had not been}} light enough to counteract the suction of the sinking ship. Where he was going he did not know, for the glare of the searchlight and the splashing of shots on the water was perfectly bewildering. [...] "I'm lost!" [...] he thought a dozen times. [...] "O God, help <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> alive!" [...] And that prayer was answered, for presently his foot touched bottom and he saw land ahead,--a bit of sandy beach between Morro Castle and a battery located on Estrella Cove, for the tide was coming in, and had carried him up the harbor instead of down.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{moved in}} here three years ago," [...] {{continued}} Jake, [...] "they met {{me and told}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out.</b> I told 'em I weren't takin' a back track that year. One night they rode down a-whoopin' and a-shoutin', and I natcherly poked my gun out'n the winder and handed out a few to 'em--an' they rode off. Next year quite a little squad o' truck farmers moved into the bend just below, an' we got together and talked it over and agreed to stand by. We planted two more o' them, and they got one on us. They control the courts, {{and so we have}} got to fight. They've got a judge that suits 'em now, and this year will be hot--it will, sure." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{could eat}} nothing {{and could not}} sleep, and I grew so nervous under those delays and the slow pace at which we {{travelled}} that I had an unreasonable desire upon <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> and walk. Yielding to my companion's better sense, however, I remained where I was. All this time, kept fresh by a certain enjoyment {{of the work in}} which he was engaged, he was up and down at every house we came to, addressing people whom he had never beheld before as old acquaintances, running in to warm himself at every fire he saw, talking and drinking and shaking hands at every bar and tap, friendly with every waggoner, wheelwright, blacksmith, and toll-taker, yet never seeming to lose time, and always mounting to the box again with his watchful, steady face and his business-like [...] "Get on, my lad!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anywhere but {{near the}} boathouse," [...] {{returned}} Blumpo, with a shiver {{that was not}} brought on entirely by his involuntary bath. [...] "If you land me there the fellows won't give <b>me</b> a chance <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of sight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come out of it, Bensington," [...] he said. [...] "It's all right. It's <b>me.</b> We've got <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of this. They're {{setting the}} place on fire. The porters are all {{clearing}} out. The servants are gone. It's lucky I caught the man who knew.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{when he saw}} us, he bade us welcome, {{and married}} us to his twelve daughters, the eldest to the eldest, and so on <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> whose bride was the {{youngest}} of all and also the prettiest. And my brothers were filled with envy, and left <b>me</b> <b>to</b> drown in a brook, but I was saved by a fish who showed <b>me</b> how <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out.</b> Now, you are a judge! Who did well, and who did evil--I or my brothers?' ...|$|R
