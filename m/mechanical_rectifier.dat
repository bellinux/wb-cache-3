5000|$|The machine {{shown in}} the {{reference}} [...] was designed by Read and Gimson et al., at British Thomson-Houston (BTH) Rugby, Warwickshire, England, in the early 1950s. It is a three-phase <b>mechanical</b> <b>rectifier</b> working at 220 volts and 15,000 amperes, and its application was the powering of huge banks of electrolysis cells.|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} of vacuum tube {{technology in the}} early 20th century resulted in the invention of various tube-type rectifiers, which largely replaced the noisy, inefficient <b>mechanical</b> <b>rectifiers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Active rectification, or {{synchronous}} rectification, is {{a technique}} for improving the efficiency of rectification by replacing diodes with actively controlled switches such as transistors, usually power MOSFETs or power BJTs. [...] Historically, vibrator driven switches or motor-driven commutators have also been used for <b>mechanical</b> <b>rectifiers</b> and synchronous rectification.|$|R
50|$|These <b>mechanical</b> <b>rectifiers</b> were {{noisy and}} had high {{maintenance}} requirements. The moving parts had friction, which required lubrication and replacement due to wear. Opening mechanical contacts under load resulted in electrical arcs and sparks that heated and eroded the contacts. They also {{were not able}} to handle AC frequencies above several thousand cycles per second.|$|R
50|$|A <b>mechanical</b> <b>rectifier</b> is {{a device}} for {{converting}} alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) {{by means of}} mechanically operated switches. The best-known type is the commutator, which {{is an integral part}} of a DC dynamo, but before solid-state devices became available, independent mechanical rectifiers were used for certain applications. Before the invention of semiconductors, rectification at high currents involved serious losses.|$|E
50|$|Other {{electromagnetic}} machines {{include the}} Amplidyne, Synchro, Metadyne, Eddy current clutch, Eddy current brake, Eddy current dynamometer, Hysteresis dynamometer, Rotary converter, and Ward Leonard set. A rotary converter {{is a combination}} of machines that act as a <b>mechanical</b> <b>rectifier,</b> inverter or frequency converter. The Ward Leonard set {{is a combination of}} machines used to provide speed control. Other machine combinations include the Kraemer and Scherbius systems.|$|E
50|$|Commutators {{are used}} in direct current (DC) machines: dynamos (DC generators) and many DC motors as well as {{universal}} motors. In a motor the commutator applies electric current to the windings. By reversing the current direction in the rotating windings each half turn, a steady rotating force (torque) is produced. In a generator the commutator picks off the current generated in the windings, reversing {{the direction of the}} current with each half turn, serving as a <b>mechanical</b> <b>rectifier</b> to convert the alternating current from the windings to unidirectional direct current in the external load circuit. The first direct current commutator-type machine, the dynamo, was built by Hippolyte Pixii in 1832, based on a suggestion by André-Marie Ampère.|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Animal {{locomotion}} possesses advantageous {{characteristics in}} animal morphology, motion efficiency and environment adaptivity, hence furnishing a natural learning template for design and optimization of robotic vehicles. Inspired by their natural analogues, {{the increasing number}} of animal-like robots have emerged in recent years. This thesis considers a class of <b>mechanical</b> <b>rectifiers</b> arising from dynamics of animal locomotion. The thesis starts with introduction of the general system modeling method of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>rectifiers,</b> followed by the description of three typical robotic implementations, namely fliptail, snake-like and flapping-wings locomotors. The dynamics of <b>mechanical</b> <b>rectifiers</b> then is revealed to be under-actuated and essentially have three components: oscillation, orientation and locomotion dynamics. The oscillation dynamics describes how the oscillatory motion of the body shape results from the interaction with environment and body actuation. The orientation dynamics shows the under-actuation property of the locomotion system where the system orientation does not receive direct control. But it is coupled with oscillation dynamics. The locomotion dynamics demonstrates the effect of the mechanical rectification where the periodic body motion is converted to the movement on the mass center. Regarding three components, the main achievement of this work has three folds. For oscillation dynamics, we introduce the natural oscillation patterns for body shape and proposed a biologically inspired controller to make the closed-loop system exactly entrain the oscillation. For orientation dynamics, we construct a orientation controller on top of the entrainment controller manipulating the average orientation to be aligned with locomotion direction, though at price of the accuracy of body oscillation. The oscillation accuracy however can be tuned by controller parameters. For locomotion dynamics, we prove that the induced body oscillation and orientation can globally achieve a specific locomotion velocity at mass center which is called natural velocity. This three efforts compose a control design framework for <b>mechanical</b> <b>rectifiers.</b> Throughout the thesis, these three aspects of the framework would be detailed by applications to the three aforementioned robotic locomotors. The effectiveness of control design framework is supported theoretically by rigorous proof and practically validated by numerical simulation...|$|R

Made of brick covered in stucco, the large interior once held old style rotary <b>mechanical</b> <b>rectifiers</b> to convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) to serve nearby streetcar and interurban lines: the Venice Short Line, Redondo Beach via Playa del Rey Line, and Santa Monica Air Line.|$|R
40|$|Switches and {{rectification}} {{devices are}} fundamental componentsused for controlling {{the flow of}} energy in numerous applications. Thermal and acoustic rectifiers have been proposed for use in biomedical ultrasound applications thermal computers energy-saving and-harvesting materials and direction-dependent insulating materials. In all these systems the transition between transmission states is smooth with increasing signal amplitudes. This limits their effectiveness as switching and logic devices, and reduces their sensitivity to external conditions as sensors. Here we overcome these limitations by demonstrating a new mechanism for tunable rectification that uses bifurcations and chaos. This mechanism has a sharp transition between states, {{which can lead to}} phononic switching and sensing. We present an experimental demonstration of this mechanism, applied in a <b>mechanical</b> energy <b>rectifier</b> operating at variable sonic frequencies. The rectifier is a granular crystal, composed of a statically compressed one-dimensional array of particles in contact, containing a light mass defect near a boundary. As a result of the defect, vibrations at selected frequencies cause bifurcations and a subsequent jump to quasiperiodic and chaotic states with broadband frequency content. We use this combination of frequency filtering and asymmetrically excited bifurcations to obtain rectification ratios greater than 10 ^ 4. We envisage this mechanism to enable the design of advanced photonic, thermal and acoustic materials and devices...|$|R

In 1903, while at Queen, he completed work on the <b>mechanical</b> <b>rectifier</b> that enabled X-ray tubes to be powered by alternating current. Also in 1903, Snook and two other employees, G. Herbert White and Edwin Kelly, left Queen to establish the Radioelectric Company. Radioelectric became the Roentgen Manufacturing Company.In 1907, Snook manufactured the first interrupterless transformer. In 1907, Snook introduced the Snook apparatus, the first interrupterless device produced for X-ray work. The Snook apparatus was manufactured in England. Snook next {{became president of the}} Roentgen Manufacturing Company in Philadelphia and was responsible for technical development and oversight of manufacturing until 1913. In 1913, Snook formed a new company and became president of the Snook-Roentgen Manufacturing Company, which grew form the Roentgen Manufacturing Company. From 1916 to 1917, he was vice-president of the Victor Electric Corporation in Chicago, Illinois and in 1917, Snook moved to New York, N.Y. to accept a position with the Western Electric Company as an electrical engineer. In 1925 he moved to Bell Telephone Laboratories, and in 1927 became a consulting engineer.|$|E
5000|$|The rotary {{converter}} {{can be thought}} of as a motor-generator, where the two machines share a single rotating armature and set of field coils. The basic construction of the {{rotary converter}} consists of a DC generator (dynamo) with a set of slip rings tapped into its rotor windings at evenly spaced intervals. When a dynamo is spun the electric currents in its rotor windings alternate as it rotates in the magnetic field of the stationary field windings. This alternating current is rectified by means of a commutator which allows DC current to be extracted from the rotor. This principle is taken advantage of by energizing the same rotor windings with AC power which causes the machine to act as a synchronous AC motor. The rotation of the energized coils excites the stationary field windings producing part of the DC current. The other part is AC current from the slip rings which is directly rectified into DC by the commutator. This makes the rotary converter a hybrid dynamo and <b>mechanical</b> <b>rectifier.</b> When used in this way it is referred to as a synchronous rotary converter or simply a synchronous converter. The AC slip rings also allow the machine to act as an alternator.|$|E

For the <b>mechanical</b> <b>rectifier</b> system consisting of multiple links in series, a biologically inspired control design approach has been proposed to study a kind of locomotion gait in natural oscillation on a plane. In this paper, the approach is further developed for more complex multi-segmental systems moving in three dimensional space. A typical example of this class of systems is the flapping-wing structure which arises from animal locomotion such as bird flying or ray swimming. Three elemental actions including oscillation, orientation, and locomotion are fully discussed in this paper in terms of theoretical analysis and numerical simulation...|$|E

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) A {{multi-link}} {{mechanical system}} designed for locomotion, {{can be regarded}} as a <b>mechanical</b> <b>rectifier</b> as periodic oscillations of the links are rectified to induce locomotion of the system. The essential mechanism underlying the limbless locomotion of many animals can be viewed as rectification that converts periodic body movements to thrust force through interaction with the environment. It inspires the mechanical design of multi-link locomotors. To undercover the fundamental engineering mechanism underlying the rectifier model, we developed a prototype <b>mechanical</b> <b>rectifier</b> (PMR) comprising of two-link system and a disk at the first stage. A biologically inspired central pattern generator (CPG) controller was developed to achieve the locomotion of the disk with a certain sense of natural oscillation of the links. This PMR system is simply enough to reveal the animal locomotion mechanism. However, it is too simple to understand the complicated locomotion gaits. Later on, we designed and manufactured a multi-link fully-actuated system to examine the ray fish-like flapping-wing gait and a multi-link under-actuated system to analyze the snake-like serpentine gait. These two systems were developed to realize the complex natural locomotion gait {{and at the same time}} to validate the effectiveness of the CPG controller to achieve the stable autonomous locomotion gaits with the undulation of the body links at natural oscillation...|$|E

It is inspired by a biological neuron circuit called central pattern generator {{and is expected to}} exhibit robust and adaptive abilities against system parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. The controller was originally designed in an ideal situation that system parameters such as friction coefficients were precisely known, and measurement channels and actuation circuits were noiseless. In this study, the authors conduct specific robustness analysis for the locomotion controller with respect to system parameter variations and measurement and actuation noises. The numerical study shows that the locomotion controller is able to maintain a reasonable performance under these circumstances...|$|E
40|$|Internally Architectured Materials (IAMs) that exhibit {{different}} {{friction forces}} for sliding {{in the opposite}} directions are proposed. This is achieved by translating deformation normal to the sliding plane into a tangential force {{in a manner that}} is akin to a toothbrush with inclined bristles. Friction asymmetry is attained by employing a layered material or a structure with parallel &# 039;ribs&# 039; inclined to the direction of sliding. A theory of directionally asymmetric friction is presented, along with prototype IAMs designed, fabricated and tested. The friction anisotropy (the -coefficient) is characterised by the ratio of the friction forces for two opposite directions of sliding. It is further demonstrated that IAM can possess very high levels of friction anisotropy, with of the order of 10. Further increase in is attained by modifying the shape of the ribs to provide them with directionally dependent bending stiffness. Prototype IAMs produced by 3 D printing exhibit truly giant friction asymmetry, with in excess of 20. A novel <b>mechanical</b> <b>rectifier,</b> which can convert oscillatory movement into unidirectional movement by virtue of directionally asymmetric friction, is proposed. Possible applications include locomotion in a constrained environment and energy harvesting from oscillatory noise and vibrations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractActive glycerinated rabbit psoas fibers were {{stretched}} at {{constant velocity}} (0. 1 – 3. 0 lengths/s) under sarcomere length control. As observed by previous investigators, force rose in two phases: an initial rapid increase {{over a small}} stretch (phase I), and a slower, more modest rise over {{the remainder of the}} stretch (phase II). The transition between the two phases occurred at a critical stretch (LC) of 7. 7 ± 0. 1 nm/half-sarcomere that is independent of velocity. The force at critical stretch (PC) increased with velocity up to 1 length/s, then was constant at 3. 26 ± 0. 06 times isometric force. The decay of the force response to a small step stretch was much faster during stretch than in isometric fibers. The addition of 3 mM vanadate reduced isometric tension to 0. 08 ± 0. 01 times control isometric tension (P 0), but only reduced PC to 0. 82 ± 0. 06 times P 0, demonstrating that prepowerstroke states contribute to force rise during stretch. The data can be explained by a model in which actin-attached cross-bridges in a prepowerstroke state are stretched into regions of high force and detach very rapidly when stretched beyond this region. The prepowerstroke state acts as a <b>mechanical</b> <b>rectifier,</b> producing large forces during stretch but small forces during shortening...|$|E
40|$|The ocean {{presents}} a vast quantity of untapped renewable energy. There exist several methods of extracting {{energy from the}} ocean waves. This system presents the concept of designing and testing a low cost wave-solar generator for Pacific Island countries. A simple self-contained wave-solar energy converter (WSEC) that can be deployed off-shore is useful in situations where there’s no supply of electricity. This device is a single unit containing all the mechanisms in an average sized barrel and placed {{on the surface of}} the sea. It operates with surging and heaving motion of the waves. The system has one moving part, gears & electric generator relative to one fixed part, the flywheel. Due to the irregular wave motions a <b>mechanical</b> <b>rectifier</b> is utilized to convert the opposing angular movements into a single directional turning alternator. For the electricity generation, a DC generator is used which provides a DC output but inconsistent power generation lead to electronic circuits being incorporated for a regulated voltage output. The design can be used in places with low wave activities as it can generate electricity with low rpm of the flywheel. All the parts for the construction of the device are readily available locally. The main purpose of this device is to provide electricity for lighting and other low powered equipment of on shore community or fisherman boat...|$|E
40|$|Biological systems {{display a}} variety of complex dynamic behaviors, ranging from {{periodic}} orbits to chaos. Regular rhythmic behavior, for instance, is associated with locomotion, while chaotic behavior is observed in neural interactions. Both these cases can be mathematically expressed as the interaction {{of a collection of}} coupled bodies or oscillators that are actuated to behave with a desired pattern. In animal locomotion, this desired pattern is the periodic body motion (gait) that interacts with the environment to generate thrust for motion. By contrast, the observed behavior of a network of neurons is possibly chaotic and flexible. This research focuses on the design and analysis of these two types of behaviors in biologically-inspired systems. A fundamental problem in animal locomotion is determining a gait that optimizes an essential performance while satisfying a desired velocity constraint. In this study, a functional model is developed for a general class of three dimensional locomotors with full (six) degrees of freedom, in addition to arbitrary finite degrees of freedom for body shape deformation. An optimal turning gait problem is then formulated for a periodic body movement that minimizes a quadratic cost function while achieving a steady turning motion with prescribed average linear and angular velocities. The problem is shown to reduce equivalently to two separate and simpler minimization problems that are both solvable for globally optimal solutions. Optimal gait theory can also be utilized in order to determine analytical justifications for observed behavior in biological systems. In this study, a simple body-fluid fish model is developed, and steady swimming at various speeds is analyzed using optimal gait theory. The results show that the gait that minimizes bending moment over tail movements and stiffness matches data from observed swimming of saithe. Furthermore, muscle tension is reduced when undulation frequency matches the resonance frequency, which maximizes the ratio of tail-tip velocity to bending moment. The final task is to design the interconnections in a network of Andronov-Hopf oscillators in order to generate desired chaotic behavior. Due to the structure of the oscillators, it is possible to generate chaos by using weak linear coupling to destabilize the phase difference between the oscillators. To this end, a set of sufficient conditions are determined to guarantee the instability of a desired periodic solution through phase destabilization. Subsequently, a condition is found to guarantee the absence of any stable harmonic orbit. Finally, additional properties are considered, where small variations in a parameter can lead to chaotic behavior. With additional research, these results can be expanded to the design of a chaotic neural controller to generate adaptive locomotion for a <b>mechanical</b> <b>rectifier...</b>|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityPanoramic {{photography}} is quite old, but {{is becoming increasingly}} important {{in the field of}} aerial photography. Due to increased efficiency of aircraft warning facilities and accuracy of anti-aircraft missles the problem of obtaining photographs for aerial reconnaissance and mapping and charting becomes extremely hazardous. The obvious solution is to fly higher and further away and to take oblique photographs. This doesn't seem to be difficult, at first glance, but the object to camera distance becomes extremely long, thereby reducing the scale of the photograph. Decreasing the scale of a photograph decreases its usability. The only way to keep a proper scale then, is to increase the focal length. Increasing the focal length increases the format size and the overall camera dimensions, and more important weight. Weight and size are at a premium in an aircraft and to combat this a folded optical system is coupled to a slit scan device which utilizes moving film. This reduces weight and size, but introduces other technical problems, which are presently being solved by the U. S. Air Force. Assuming that the panoramic camera is built and is operational suitable. A method of rectification must be devised in order to effectively utilize the photography. Three methods of rectification are discussed. First, a pancratic lens coupled to a slit scanning device. Second, a <b>mechanical</b> <b>rectifier,</b> utilizing moving film and paper. Third, a mathematical Solution. The pancratic lens-slit scan system tends to recreate the conditions in existence at the time of exposure. The Scheimpflug condition is neglected by selecting a slit width so small that the image remains within the focal range. During the exposure the images were in perfect focus from nadir to horizon, as the distances involved are considered to be infinity. But in rectifier the object to image distance varies from 4 feet at the nadir to 6 feet at 0 = 60 °. Therefore a lens system had to be designed to keep proper focus for all object to image distances and the proper magnification, (to insure the correct scale). These two variables are a function of the angle of scan (0). The basic design for this pancratic lens starts with selecting 2 lenses of 22 inch focal length and computing the movements necessary to accomplish the required magnifications and focal distances. It was found that this could be easily accomplished, but the final lens system would have to be designed by a competent lens designer and would be much more complicated, due to a aberration corrections. For proper illumination the filament of the light source has to move as a function of 0 in order to keep imaged onto the aperture. The effective f/no very nicely stayed approximately the same, 14. 75 to 17. 25, throughout all the lens movements. For overall illumination the speed of the scan has to vary to compensate for loss due to the inverse square law, due to tilting of the image plane, and due to increased density of negative toward the horizon. The second system, the mechanical system, consists of either a pancratic or a fixed lens system, with the negative moving past a slit and the image being projected down on a table onto moving paper. The moving parts that have to be calibrated are: the negative, printing paper, light source filament, 1 st projection lens, 2 nd projection lens, rotation of lens system, image to object distance, and tilt of easel. Most of these relationships are easy to compute and control, but the paper speed when determined will be difficult to control. As has been observed in the field, continuous printing devices do not operate efficiently in operational organizations. The third system, the mathematical solution, uses surfaces which were derived by trial and error after extensive mathematical research. This system can be proved, mathematically, not to be perfect. In fact the distortion has not been reduced less than 14 per cent. This is too much for reconnaissance and charting purposes. In view of the limitations of the various rectifiers it is felt that the pancratic lens-slit scan system would be the most practical rectifier for field use. If accepted for field use this pancratic lens system could eventually replace the current tri-metrago method of charting. The panoramic rectification system would eliminate many operations and specialized techniques and save money by reducing man-power requirements per chart...|$|E
