60|$|Though Anne did {{not expect}} such a {{catastrophe}} as this, she was <b>really</b> <b>grateful</b> for the offer, and thought it possible that she might avail herself of it, as {{she had not been}} able to communicate with any of her mother's old friends, and Bishop Ken was not to her knowledge still in London.|$|R

60|$|After {{some time}} the fox {{thought he would}} see if the Count Piro was <b>really</b> <b>grateful</b> to him for all he had done, {{and went back to}} the castle, where he lay down on the door-step, and pretended to be dead.

5000|$|Both Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Michelle Trachtenberg, by {{the time}} the film went into production, were looking for {{independent}} films where making money was not the main goal. Trachtenberg was filming EuroTrip (2004) in Prague when she first received the script, and quickly decided to join production. Gordon-Levitt was especially praiseful of Araki for allowing him to join production, and commented in a 2005 interview: [...] "It is a really different role for me, and I'll always be <b>really</b> <b>grateful</b> to Gregg for believing that I could do a role like this. I've played the nice kid, and the smart one or funny one and even the angry one, but Gregg {{was the first one to}} call me sexy, and I'll always be <b>really</b> <b>grateful</b> for that." [...] Araki approached Gordon-Levitt, who was by then struggling to find work for over a year, after seeing him in Manic (2001). Made on a low budget, filming commenced in August 2003 and lasted only three weeks, which gave the cast and crew no possibility of doing retakes.|$|R

60|$|Isa {{was very}} much upset at my displeasure. She came to me {{afterwards}} {{and said she was}} greatly grieved; but Metelill would not move, and she had always supposed it wrong to make acquaintance with strangers in that chance way. I represented that making room was not picking up acquaintance, and she owned it, and was <b>really</b> <b>grateful</b> for the reproof; but, as I told her, no doubt such a rule must be necessary in a place like Oxford.|$|R

In such cases, {{there would be no}} contempt mixed up with the lady's gratitude. But ladies are never <b>really</b> <b>grateful</b> to a man for turning himself into a flunky." ...|$|R

60|$|How empty are our {{conceptions of}} Deity! We admit {{theoretically}} that God is good, omnipotent, omnipresent, infinite, {{and then we}} try to give information to this infinite Mind; and plead for unmerited pardon, and a liberal outpouring of benefactions. Are we <b>really</b> <b>grateful</b> for the good already received? Then we shall avail ourselves of the blessings we have, and thus be fitted to receive more. Gratitude {{is much more than}} a verbal expression of thanks Action expresses more gratitude than speech.|$|R

60|$|The {{chairman}} of the railway had been enjoying her hospitality for several days, and he was <b>really</b> <b>grateful</b> for it. It was only since he had left Sta.

In the capital {{he had been the}} guest of the Legation, and had been kept busy negotiating with the members of Don Vincente's Government--cultured men, men to whom the conditions of civilized business were not unknown.|$|R
60|$|Twenty {{minutes later}} I {{knocked at the}} door of the lady's private cabin, with my best bedside manner in full play. As I suspected, she was nervous--nothing more--my mere smile {{reassured}} her. I observed that she held her thumb fast, doubled under in her fist, all the time I was questioning her, as Hilda had said; and I also noticed that the fingers closed about it convulsively at first, but gradually relaxed as my voice restored confidence. She thanked me profusely, and was <b>really</b> <b>grateful.</b>|$|R
