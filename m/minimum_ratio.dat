The maximum and <b>minimum</b> void <b>ratios</b> are functions of soil properties such as grain size distribution, uniformity coefficient, angularity, {{and percentage of}} fine contents. Based on the existing results, {{it appears that the}} difference between the maximum and <b>minimum</b> void <b>ratios,</b> not maximum void <b>ratio</b> or <b>minimum</b> void <b>ratio</b> alone, is the controlling parameter for compressibility, relative density, and strength of granular soils. In spite of some scatter, the difference between the maximum and <b>minimum</b> void <b>ratio</b> bears a unique relationship to the median grain size. Several correlations relating the median grain size with the strength and compressibility are presented...|$|R

It also sets a <b>minimum</b> <b>ratio</b> of direct health care spending to premium income, and creates price competition bolstered by the creation of three standard insurance coverage levels to enable like-for-like comparisons by consumers, and a web-based health insurance exchange where consumers can compare prices and purchase plans. The system preserves private insurance and private health care providers and provides subsidies {{in the form of}} income tax reductions to enable lower income Americans to buy insurance. PPACA also made many changes to the 1997, 2000 and 2003 laws that had previously changed Medicare and further expanded eligibility for Medicaid (that expansion was later ruled by the Supreme Court to be at the discretion of the states) ...|$|E

30|$|Besides the {{lamination}} thickness {{effect on}} RS strength, the width-to-thickness of laminations is also believed to affect RS strength evaluations. European Standard EN 16351 : 2013 [2], thus recommends the <b>minimum</b> width-to-thickness <b>ratio</b> of 4 to use higher RS characteristic strength of 1.1  MPa. Similarly, in Canada, the <b>minimum</b> width-to-depth <b>ratio</b> of 3.5 is recommended [19]. In this study, the width-to-depth ratios of the laminations in the CLT specimens all exceeded 4. Further research {{is required to}} study how the width-to-thickness ratio affects the RS strength of CLT in a quantitative manner. Given <b>minimum</b> width-to-depth <b>ratio</b> is satisfied, it seems more rational to provide different RS strength properties for CLT products consisting of different lamination thickness.|$|R

40|$|Maximum {{and stable}} {{hyperaemia}} are critical prerequisites for the accurate measurement of fractional flow reserve (FFR). However, {{in some patients}} in whom hyperaemia is induced through a central vein (IV) the minimum distal coronary pressure to aortic pressure ratio (Pd/Pa ratio) develops before the stabilisation of hyperaemia. We sought to describe the prevalence, magnitude and clinical implications of this phenomenon. The FFR tracing archive of a single institution was reviewed {{and a total of}} 104 high-quality IV-FFR recordings from 90 patients were identified. Whenever the <b>minimum</b> Pd/Pa <b>ratio</b> was found before the onset of stable hyperaemia, a search for the lowest Pd/Pa ratio within the steady-state hyperaemic plateau was performed and labelled as FFRstable. Whilst in most cases the <b>minimum</b> Pd/Pa <b>ratio</b> developed during stable hyperaemia, in 19 cases (prevalence of 18. 3 % [95 % CI: 12. 0 % to 26. 8 %]) this value was found before the stabilisation of the hyperaemic state. In such cases, the <b>minimum</b> Pd/Pa <b>ratio</b> stabilised later at a higher level (0. 77 ± 0. 09 vs. 0. 81 ± 0. 08, p 0. 80. During IV adenosine infusion, the <b>minimum</b> Pd/Pa <b>ratio</b> occurs before the stabilisation of hyperaemia in a significant proportion of cases.
