40|$|We collate the {{evidence}} for rotation-powered neutron stars that are visible as X-ray sources and not as radio pulsars. Quantitative upper limits exist for the radio fluxes of eight objects, revealing a population at least {{an order of magnitude}} less luminous at radio wavelengths than known radio pulsars of similar power or age. These objects could have intrinsically low radio luminosities, but a simple alternative explanation is that they are pulsars in which the <b>radio</b> <b>beams</b> are directed away from Earth. Where hard X-ray or gamma-ray fluxes are seen, the beaming explanation implies different emission sites for the high-energy radiation and the unseen <b>radio</b> <b>beams.</b> We estimate that (a) the <b>radio</b> <b>beaming</b> fraction of young pulsars is roughly 50 %, certainly much less than 100 %, and (b) one neutron star is born in the Galaxy every ~ 90 years. We conclude that probably all neutron stars are born as radio pulsars and that most young, nearby pulsars have already been discovered.

40|$|In this diploma thesis {{we study}} the {{characteristics}} of electromagnetic fields carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) by analyzing and utilizing results achieved in optics and then apply them to the radio domain to enable innovative radio studies of space {{and the development of}} new concepts in wireless communications. With the recent advent of fast digital converters it has become possible, over a wide radio frequency range, to manipulate not only the modulation properties of any given signal carried by a <b>radio</b> <b>beam,</b> but also the physical field vectors which make up the <b>radio</b> <b>beam</b> itself. Drawing inferences from results obtained in optics and quantum communication research during the past 10 - 15 years, we extract the core information about fields carrying orbital angular momentum. We show that with this information it is possible to design an array of antennas which, together with digital receivers/transmitters, can readily produce, under full software control, a <b>radio</b> <b>beam</b> that carries electromagnetic orbital angular momentum, a classical electrodynamics quantity known for a century but so far preciously little utilized in radio, if at all. This electromagnetic field is then optimized with the help of various antenna array techniques to improve the radio vector field qualities. By explicit numerical solution of the Maxwell equations from first principles, using a de facto industrial standard antenna software package, we show th at the field indeed carries orbital angular momentum, and give a hint on how to detect and measure orbital angular momentum in <b>radio</b> <b>beams.</b> Finally, we discuss and give an explanation of what this can be used for and what the future might bring in this area...|$|R
40|$|We {{argue that}} eclipses of radio {{emission}} from the millisecond pulsar A {{in the double}} pulsar system J 0737 - 3039 are due to synchrotron absorption by plasma in the closed field line region of the magnetosphere of its normal pulsar companion B. A's <b>radio</b> <b>beam</b> only illuminates B's magnetosphere for about 10 minutes surrounding the time of eclipse. During this time it heats particles at r≳ 10 ^ 9 cm to relativistic energies and enables extra plasma to be trapped by magnetic mirroring. An enhancement of the plasma density by a factor ∼ 10 ^ 2 is required to match the duration and optical depth of the observed eclipses. The extra plasma might be supplied by a source near B through Bγ pair creation by energetic photons produced in B's outer gap. Excitation of pairs' gyrational motions by cyclotron absorption of A's <b>radio</b> <b>beam</b> can result in their becoming trapped between conjugate mirror points in B's magnetosphere. Because the trapping efficiency decreases with increasing optical depth, the plasma density enhancement saturates even under steady state illumination. The result is an eclipse with finite, frequency dependent, optical depth. After illumination by A's <b>radio</b> <b>beam</b> ceases, the trapped particles cool and are lost. The entire cycle repeats every orbital period. We speculate that the asymmetries between eclipse ingress and egress result {{in part from the}} magnetosphere's evolution toward a steady state when illuminated by A's <b>radio</b> <b>beam.</b> We predict that A's linear polarization will vary with both eclipse phase and B's rotational phase.

40|$|Ionospheric {{modification}} by {{high power}} radio waves and by chemical releases are combined in a theoretical study of ionospheric focused heating. The release of materials which promote electron-ion recombination creates {{a hole in}} the bottomside ionosphere. The ionospheric hole focuses high power radio waves from a ground-based transmitter to give a 20 dB or greater enhancement in power density. The intense <b>radio</b> <b>beam</b> excites atomic oxygen by collisions with accelerated electrons. Airglow from the excited oxygen provides a visible trace of the focused beam. The large increase in the intensity of the <b>radio</b> <b>beam</b> stimulates new wave-plasma interactions.

40|$|We {{argue that}} eclipses of radio {{emission}} from the millisecond pulsar A in the binary pulsar system J 0737 - 3039 {{are due to}} synchrotron absorption by plasma in the closed field line region of the magnetosphere of its normal pulsar companion B. Irradiation by A’s <b>radio</b> <b>beam</b> heats particles at r � 10 9 cm in B’s magnetosphere to relativistic energies. Heating also enable extra plasma, beyond that needed to maintain the corotation magnetic field, {{to remain in the}} magnetosphere. Such plasma might be supplied by a source near B through Bγ pair creation by energetic photons produced in B’s outer gap. We show that enhancement of the plasma density by a factor of ∼ 10 2 boosts the eclipse duration and optical depth to where they match values determined by observation. We demonstrate how the plasma density enhancement might saturate under steady state illumination by A’s <b>radio</b> <b>beam</b> at a value consistent with that needed to match observations (cannot exceed several hundred at r = 10 9 cm). The maximum optical depth for absorption cannot be arbitrarily high and is a function of frequency. The plasma properties in B’s magnetosphere vary during eclipse as a result of evolution towards a steady state thus accounting for the observed asymmetries between eclipse ingress and egress. We offer two predictions for future observations. A’s linear polarization will vary with both eclipse phase and B’s rotational phase. Excess high frequency radio emission modulated by B’s rotation will be detected at a level of ∼ 0. 01 − 0. 1 mJy at about 100 GHz when B’s magnetosphere is illuminated by A’s <b>radio</b> <b>beam...</b>|$|R
