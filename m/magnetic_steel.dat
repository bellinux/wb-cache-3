25|$|Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Weber {{built the}} first {{electromagnetic}} telegraph used for regular communication in 1833 in Göttingen, connecting Göttingen Observatory and the Institute of Physics, covering {{a distance of about}} 1km. The setup consisted of a coil that could be moved up and down over the end of two <b>magnetic</b> <b>steel</b> bars. The resulting induction current was transmitted through two wires to the receiver, consisting of a galvanometer. The direction of the current could be reversed by commuting the two wires in a special switch. Therefore, Gauss and Weber chose to encode the alphabet in a binary code, using positive and negative currents as the two states.|$|E
60|$|Here, it must needs be said, that {{accidents}} {{like this}} have {{in more than}} one case occurred to ships in violent storms. The magnetic energy, as developed in the mariner's needle, is, as all know, essentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven; hence it is not to be much marvelled at, that such things should be. In instances where the lightning has actually struck the vessel, so as to smite down some of the spars and rigging, the effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal; all its loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before <b>magnetic</b> <b>steel</b> was of no more use than an old wife's knitting needle. But in either case, the needle never again, of itself, recovers the original virtue thus marred or lost; and if the binnacle compasses be affected, the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship; even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. With an {{increasing}} demand for high grade electric <b>magnetic</b> <b>steels,</b> SSRF(Single Snorkel Refining Furance) has got much attention {{due to its}} high efficiency of both decarburization and desulphurization. However the desulphurization mechanism of this kind SSRF is remarkably {{different from that of}} other steel refining processes such as LF,RH etc., so it is necessary to understand the behaviour of desulphurization clearly. A mathmatical model has been established in this paper to investigate the degree of desulpurization with time {{on the basis of the}} influencing factors such as sulphur capacity of flux,stirring energy of molten steel. It is shown that the desulpurization rate constant is about 1. 0 E- 8 in accordance with the data from the practical test of a steel plant with SSRF...|$|R

40|$|We present model calculations, {{based on}} the {{continuum}} theory of micromagnetics, for the correlation function of the spin-misalignment SANS cross section of bulk ferromagnets (e. g. elemental polycrystalline ferromagnets, soft and hard magnetic nanocomposites, nanoporous ferromagnets, or <b>magnetic</b> <b>steels).</b> For such materials, the spin disorder which is related to spatial variations in the saturation magnetization and magnetic anisotropy field results in strong spin-misalignment scattering dΣM/dΩ along the forward direction [1]. When the applied magnetic field is perpendicular to the incoming neutron beam, the characteristics of dΣM/dΩ (e. g. the angular anisotropy on a two-dimensional detector or the asymptotic power-law exponent) {{are determined by the}} ratio of magnetic anisotropy-field strength Hp to the jump ΔM in the saturation magnetization at internal interfaces. Here, we analyze the corresponding one and two-dimensional real-space correlations as a function of applied magnetic field, ratio Hp/ΔM, single-particle form factor, and particle volume fraction. Finally, we compare the theoretical results for the correlation function to experimental data on a Nd-Fe-B-based nanocomposite...|$|R
40|$|An X-band RF dry load made of <b>magnetic</b> {{stainless}} <b>steel,</b> SS 430, {{was designed}} {{to work at a}} low surface electric field. The optimization process of the lossy section was performed using an S-matrix formalism and the maximum surface electric field is below 55 MV/m at an input power of 100 MW. A new elliptical polarizer was proposed making a smooth transition from the linearly polarized point at the input of the load to the circularly polarized point {{at the entrance to the}} lossy region. This design suppresses the local enhancement of the electromagnetic field, resulting in a very broad bandwidth of 1 GHz below – 20 dB. Based on this design, a test load was fabricated. It was clarified that the surface resistance of the <b>magnetic</b> stainless <b>steel</b> SS 430 was decreased by a factor of ~ 1. 2 due to the high temperature brazing process.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of suitable drive technologies {{for use in}} a new high-speed machining spindle was performed to determine critical research areas. The focus is on a hysteresis motor topology using a solid, inherently-balanced D 2 steel shaft. An analytical model of the motor is devised in order to make performance predictions and optimization, and an experimental apparatus is constructed in order to verify the predictions of the model and investigate speed limits. The model's limitations due to a still-incomplete understanding of the vector hysteresis properties of <b>magnetic</b> <b>steels</b> are noted, and a proposal for an experiment to resolve this limitation is presented. The model predicts that the motor performance is optimized for a very thin ring of hysteretic steel. The experimental apparatus used a solid rotor. It was run up to a speed of 11, 000 RPM and torque-speed curves with various drive parameters are measured. by Jacob D. Bayless. Thesis: S.

50|$|To reduce {{component}} size, weight, durability requirements, {{and most}} importantly, cost, the magnetic circuit must be optimized to deliver more {{energy to the}} projectile for a given energy input. This has been addressed to some extent {{by the use of}} back iron and end iron, which are pieces of magnetic material that enclose the coil and create paths of lower reluctance in order to improve the amount of magnetic flux coupled into the projectile. Results can vary widely, depending on the materials used; hobbyist designs may use, for example, materials ranging anywhere from <b>magnetic</b> <b>steel</b> (more effective, lower reluctance) to video tape (little improvement in reluctance). Moreover, the additional pieces of magnetic material in the magnetic circuit can potentially exacerbate the possibility of flux saturation and other magnetic losses.|$|E
