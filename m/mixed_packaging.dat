40|$|The studied {{retail brand}} owning company has two {{problems}} related to the distributors’ ordering process. The first problem is that many developed products are cancelled and never produced. The second problem is high material handling cost for distributors, due to many received <b>mixed</b> <b>packaging.</b> Therefore, {{the aim of the}} study is to propose an ordering strategy that differentiates products based on their ordering characteristics, for the ordering process between the retail brand owning company and its distributors and suppliers, in order to decrease the material handling cost for distributors and the large amount of cancelled products. Generally, more strategies, for retailers’ ordering process than distributors’ ordering process, are presented in literature. Hence, the ordering process is also interesting to study from a research point of view. The process, to create a differentiated ordering strategy, was divided into four parts. Firstly, stakeholders’ requirements were identified for segmentation, order quantity restrictions, and implementation, to detect what aspects of ordering that are most relevant for the study. Secondly, a segmentation of the product assortment was made, to identify product segments that are suitable for having different ordering strategies. The segmentation consisted of four segments. The dimensions of the segmentation matrix are distributors’ risk and demand, which are areas primarily affecting the ordering. Each Ekldimension consisted of an underlying factor. The factor for risk is customer segment, and the factor for demand is first forecast on colour level. Thirdly, order quantity restrictions were examined. Order quantity restrictions, MOQs and multiples, were recommended for all four segments. Finally, the required changes to implement the differentiated ordering strategy were identified. As a result of the differentiated ordering strategy, different product segments will have different order quantity restrictions. By implementing multiples, new packaging instructions, and a higher MOQ for 85 % of the products, the amount of <b>mixed</b> <b>packaging</b> are decreased. As a result of less <b>mixed</b> <b>packaging,</b> the material handling cost for distributors is reduced. Moreover, by a differentiated MOQ and a first forecast on colour level, the large amount of cancelled products will decrease...|$|E

40|$|Purslane (Portulaca oleracea L.) is {{a common}} weed that grows {{all over the world}} and is one of the most {{widespread}} weed species in summer crops. However, it has great potential to become a new crop since its identification as one of the best plant sources ofω- 3 fatty acid, α-linolenic acid, as well as some antioxidants (α-tocopherol, β-carotene, ascorbic acid, and glutathione). Several other features distinguish this species: high content of crude protein, water-soluble polysaccharides useful as gums, and good tolerance to salinity. This review summarizes purslane’s origin, botanical, and physiological features while its nutritional and medical properties are reported in reference to several studies carried out on its chemical properties. Finally, its cultivation potential is discussed and future uses are proposed for this species, mainly as a component in ready-to-use vegetables (especially in <b>mixed</b> <b>packaging)</b> but also for other cultivation purposes...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{carried out}} {{and the results of}} the Master Thesis “Comparison of packaging collection systems in Latvia” give an overview about level of the development of packaging collection systems, as well as possible ways to improve their performance. In Latvia, there are two packaging collection systems implemented for management of recyclable waste in different towns. In this study, sorted packaging collection system is described (advantages, disadvantages, costs of performance, the amount and quality of the collected material), followed by the corresponding description of the <b>mixed</b> <b>packaging</b> collection system. The systems are compared and ways to upgrade both systems are offered. During the course of the thesis the author collected necessary information about the packaging recycling systems in Europe and Latvia, obtained the necessary details and information from the staff of the Ministry of Environment of Latvia and waste handling organizations and held a social enquiry. The information obtained during the research reveals data on the flow of the waste packaging and its components, as well as the activity of the residents in the recycling process. Data analysis made it possible to analyze the costs of integrating and maintaining the systems, as well as to propose the measures which can help to improve them in order to make their performance more effective and socially acceptable. The figures and information obtained during the research can be used for upgrading of the Waste management plans in the regions of Latvia or for a successful introduction of a new collection system in a town or region. The results show that at the moment {{it is not possible to}} clearly state which one of the two systems is better for Latvia because performance of each system depends on a list of factors, such as social, e. g. residents’ involvement in the process, and economical factors. A conducted survey revealed that residents are more likely to participate in a recycling process if they do not have to sort packaging by types. Data analysis showed that there is a substantial difference in transportation and sorting expenses between these two systems, however this difference is too small to make any of the systems profitable for recovery of paper and plastic material. Only collection of glass material proved to be economically profitable in both systems...|$|E

40|$|Placing a {{price on}} {{greenhouse}} gas emissions using an emissions tax or auctioning tradable permits provide the least cost government intervention to reduce pollution. Initial effects of the charge on pollution include {{an increase in the}} relative prices of greenhouse gas intensive products and production processes to reduce pollution, and a net increase in indirect taxes with a windfall boost to government revenue. There are at least three overlapping sets of economic efficiency, equity and political acceptance reasons for returning most of the windfall revenue gains to households as compensating income tax reductions and increases in social security payments as a tax <b>mix</b> change <b>package.</b> Most of the indirect tax increases will be passed onto consumers as a higher cost of living, albeit with changes in relative prices. With a likely regressive incidence, some compensation in a close to lump sum form has both equity and political acceptability claims. With no changes in market wages and nominal interest rates, the higher cost of living will further distort the effects of existing income taxes on labour and capital market decisions and their associated efficiency costs. Or, the cost of living increase will provide a catalyst for compensating increases in market wages and nominal interest rates, with the added risk of initiating an inflationary cycle. A tax <b>mix</b> change <b>package</b> has the potential to neutralise the negative effects of the associated increase in indirect taxation. Given the expected time path of increases in the pollution charge on greenhouse gas emissions, and of the windfall increase in indirect tax revenue, the details of new tax <b>mix</b> change <b>package</b> will need to be renegotiated every few years.

40|$|Cement {{manufacturing}} is {{an energy}} and carbon-intensive industry. The cement industry contributes approximately 5 % {{of the global}} man-made carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions and is thus becoming the second largest CO 2 contributor in industry after power plants. A wide range of options are available to considerably reduce CO 2 emissions. This paper reviewed major point sources of CO 2 emissions at all stages of cement manufacturing, including (1) raw material preparation (grinding and transportation), (2) clinker production and the combustion of fuels in the kiln and (3) the production of cement final product (milling, blending, <b>mixing,</b> <b>packaging</b> and transportation. Various CO 2 mitigation strategies are subsequently discussed, including (1) energy efficiency improvements; (2) waste heat recovery; (3) the substitution of fossil fuel with renewable energy; (4) the production of low carbon cement by replacing ordinary Portland cement with alternative materials, i. e., geo-polymers, blast furnace slag, coal fly ash, and natural pozzolanic materials; and (5) carbon capture and storage. Although reviewed CO 2 mitigation measures are indeed beneficial to the environment, however, they are also bounded by some limitations. The limitations and selection of CO 2 mitigation measure are also outlined in this paper...|$|R
