40|$|Abstract- A few {{specimens}} of <b>macruran</b> decapod crustaceans from the Apsheronsk Re-gion (N Caucasus, Russia) are described. The specimens {{were found in}} the layers of the Maikop Formation, dated back to Lower Miocene. The study of this material brought to the description of the two new genera Longitergite nov.

Even though the sample is represented only by a few specimens, it plays a particularly important role, since it enriches the previous knowledge about the <b>macruran</b> decapod crustaceans of Miocene of N Caucasus. Moreover, the genus Bannikovia nov. enri-ches the knowledge about the Miocene carideans, adding to the two forms already know...|$|E

40|$|From August 1977 to February 1983, the {{distributions}} {{and food}} habits of righteye flounders Limanda herzensteini and L. yokohamae in Mutsu Bay, Aomori Prefecture, were investigated. Results of tagging experiments conducted {{for six years}} suggested that both species in the bay hardly migrated outside it. In winter they were found chiefly in West Bay. In the other seasons L. herzensteini concentrated in West Bay or western part of East Bay, or both, while L. yokohamae {{in the eastern part}} of East Bay. L. herzensteini fed chiefly on polychaetes, sea-hares, bivalves, and ophiuroides from spring to autumn and in winter fish and <b>macrurans</b> became very important in their diet. On the other hand, L. yokohamae fed exclusively on polychaetes throughout the year. There was a considerable difference in species selection for prey and food composition in stomachs between the two species. However, ingested-food compositions did not differ very much between the two species in the same area, suggesting that they need a similar food resource and so compete potentially for food and habitat...|$|R
40|$|Decapod {{crustaceans}} have elaborate statocysts {{to detect}} {{changes in the}} body position. They utilize these organs to initiate and control various equilibrium reactions {{so that they can}} always maintain an upright posture. In <b>macrurans,</b> these reactions consist of asymmetrical movements of walking legs, swimmeret 9 and uropods, as well as compensatory movements of the eyestalks and antennae. They have been previously described in terms of a simple input (i. e. the tilt angle) -and-output (i. e. the magnitude of the resultant reaction) relationship (e. g. Schone, 1954). But do these equilibrium reactions occur whenever the animal tilts? We report here that one of them, the uropod steering movement, does not occur by itself and always occurs together with the abdominal movement which is unrelated to the equilibrium reaction. It is shown that this association of two independent movements is not mediated by any peripheral sense organ. Quantitative aspects of the uropod steering movement were described elsewhere (Yoshino, Takahata & Hisada, 1980). When the crayfish Procambarus clarkii Girard is rolled without the leg substratum, the uropod on the upper side is spread out while the one on the lower side is closed...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{recognition}} of four broad groups within Decapoda – natantians, <b>macrurans,</b> anomurans and brachy-urans – {{has long been a}} staple of textbooks and even the primary taxonomic literature, a precise resolution of phylogenetic relationships within the order has proved more difficult. Indeed, there have been as many schemes of decapod taxonomy and phylogeny as there were experts who wished to offer an opinion. In this decade, utilization of explicit cladistic methods of analysis and the application of molecular techniques have produced a series of clear hypotheses concerning the relationships within many of the groups of Decapoda. It is apparent that earlier conflicts of opinion can be related in part to the implicit problems of dealing with paraphyletic groups near the base of the tree that are too broadly defined by only general or plesiomorphic features. Comprehensive morphological analyses of both fossil and living forms, with attention being paid to defining synapomorphies, can lead to resolution of old controversies. Molecular techniques hold great promise towards providing further resolution, but currently suffer from insufficiencies of sampling. Nevertheless, where once there was chaos and vexation, there is now some enlightenment. The situation can only improve, but the broad outlines of decapod deep history are already emerging...|$|R
40|$|Coastal marine zones {{located in}} front of large rivers are of major {{biological}} interest. In these areas, {{the origin of the}} organic matter is complex and highly variable. The continental inputs, added to the nutrients already present in the marine environment, influence considerably the productivity and functioning of the ecosystems. Used {{for the first time in}} aquatic ecology on the Romanian coast, the proportion of stable isotopes of carbon (13 C/ 12 C) and nitrogen (15 N/ 14 N) allowed the identification of the organic material sources (terrestrial and marine) as well as the analysis of the food webs due to the predictable isotopic relation between consumers and their food. Preliminary analyses of stable isotopes of the particulate organic matter POM of the Danube water as well as marine POM, sediments and marine organisms were made on 186 samples collected at 10 stations in October 2004. The identification of the isotopic signatures of the main sources of organic material (terrestrial and marine) was achieved along with those of some groups of marine organisms present in this area (macrophytes, bivalves, polychaetes, amphipods, <b>macrurans,</b> brachyurans and fish). The results obtained in the Black Sea were compared with those of the Mediterranean Sea seawards the Rhone river and showed that the isotopic signatures of the two river POM were close to each other, whereas they largely differed in marine phytoplankton and macrophytes...|$|R

Comparisons of clectromyo-grams recorded from some of the principal muscles involved in these overtly very different behaviour patterns reveal that homologous muscles in the two sand crabs tend to be activated at comparable phase positions (Table 1).

40|$|The {{addition}} of protease inhibitors and antibiotics provides a valuable means of stabilizing proteins in solution {{but this is}} less desirable if the physiological properties of a biological fluid, such as haemolymph, are to be accurately evaluated. Freezing haemolymph {{has proved to be}} a convenient way both of transporting samples from remote sites and of storage for longer periods. Although many investigators have suspected and intimated that freezing may affect haemocyanin function there are few data describing exactly what these effects may be. Mangum (1983 a) provided some data for Squilla empusa haemocyanin indicating that freezing did not alter the P 50 affinity but did reduce the cooperativity of O 2 binding. Similar results were reported for Palaemon elegans (Bridges et al. 1984; Morris et al. 1985). These reports that cooperativity may be reduced by freezing indicate that structural changes occur that may lead to changes in affinity, despite the P 50 remaining unchanged.

40|$|I. In Hippa pacifica, mitotic {{division}} of germinal epithelial cells produces primary spermatocytes which, as sustentacular-like cells appear, divide meiotically to form spermatids. 2. Concurrently as spermatids metamorphose into spermatozoa, germinal epithelial cells renew their activity and again produce primary spermatocytes which, as they fill the sacculus, expel the spermatozoa. 3. A continuous spermatogenic mass enters the vas deferens, where an enveloping secretion from the epithelial cells bounding the lumen forms a thin sheath to the sperm mass. 4. The lumen (viewed in cross-section) becomes keyhole-shaped and a secretion from a wedge-shaped group of cells bounded by two deep crypts both surrounds the sheathed sperm mass and forms a ribbon-like supporting stalk and a broad, basal foot. 5. As the lumen again becomes circular (in cross-section), a secretion from the epithelial cells surrounds the completed spermatophore and forms the homogeneous matrix. 6. The spermatophore of H. pacifica is both macruran-like, {{because of its}} con-tinuous, highly convoluted sperm mass, and anomuran-like, because of its raised spermatophore and broad foot. 7. Neither the anomuran-like spermatophore of a <b>macruran,</b> Parrabicus antarcticus, nor the macruran-like spermatophore of an anomuran, Hippa pacifica, justifies the inference that these two animals occupy a systematic position intermediate between the Macrura and the Anomura, but rather illustrates the need for consideration of many characters before postulating relationships...|$|E
40|$|Examining {{the stomach}} {{contents}} of the yellwfin and the bigeye tunas obtained {{in the western part}} of South Pacific Ocean for about thirty days, October 1958, and the following results were obtained; (1) In the Fiji area, there occured many fish having rather empty stomach than in the other area, therefore, this area seems to be poor in food organisms. (2) Food organisms found in the stomach amounted to about 27 kind (c. f. Table 4), being remarkably poor than in the equatorial region. Among them, Alepisaurids, Carangids, Lepidotids, Paralepids, Ostraciontids, Balistids, Cephalopods and <b>Macruran</b> shrimps occupied more than 10 %, respectively. These are probably the most important as prey of tunas in the Fiji area. (3) Coelenterates were rather abundant in the Fiji area than in the region to the north of 20 °S. (4) There differences of food-habit among both fish in respects of certain kind of preys. Several deep sea fish, such as Paralepids and Alepisaurids, occured in the bigeye tuna at higher frequency than in the yellowfin tuna. Others, such as Chiasmodontids and Sternoptychids occured in the bigeye tuna, being absent in the yellowfin tuna. Several surface sea fish, such as Carangids, Scombrids, Clupeids and Ostraciontids, on the contrary, were found more abundant in the yellowfin tuna than the bigeye tuna. Others, such as Balistids, Molids, Coryphaenids and the youngs of Katsuwonids were not seen in the bigeye tuna. From the mentioned above, it will be presumed that the bigeye tuna may be essentially the resident in slightly deeper layer compared with the yellowfin tuna. ﻿フイジー海域におけるマグロ類の胃内容物の特徴として下記の傾向が認められた. 1. 赤道から南北にへだたる程,空胃が多くなる. 従って,この海域はマグロ類にとって餌料となるべき生物の量が少ないものと考えられる. 2. 本海域に見られた餌料生物は約 27 種で,赤道海域より種類が顕著に少ない. そのうち, 10 %以上の高い出現率を示したpreyはミズウオ科・アジ科・シマガツオ科・ハダカエソ科・モンガラカワハギ科・ハコフグ科の魚類 6 種とイカ類・エビ類で,本海域の鮪類の餌料として重要な﻿占めるものと思われる. 3. クラゲ類は他の海域より高い出現率を示した. 4. 数種の餌料について,キハダとメバチにかなり顕著な食性の相異が認められた. 深海性のハダカエソ科・ミズウオ科はメバチにその出現割合が大きい. 深海性のムネエソ科・クロバウズギス科はメバチに出現し,キハダではその出現を見なかった. 表層性のモンガラカワハギ科・マンボ科・シイラ科及びカツオ若年魚はキハダには見られ,メバチには出現を見なかった. 又,表層性のアジ科・サバ科・イワシ科・ハコフグ科がキハダにその出現割合が大きい. 以上の傾向から,メバチの棲息分布はキハダより深い層にあるということが考えられる...|$|E
40|$|To undersatnd {{adaptive}} {{functions for}} thermal {{changes of the}} central nervous system (CNS),the abdominal ganglia and muscle of crustaceans responding to transient temperature changes were investigated. Further, three species living under different temperature conditions (Panulirus japonicus,Penaeusjaponicus and Homarus americanus) were chosen for the studies. Firstly,firing properties of the central neurons responding to cooling or warming of the isolated abdominal ganglia were described. The temperature sensitive neurons were defined as“cool-sensitive neurons”because they were excited by a small fall in temperature. Their sensory properties were discussed. Secondly,both neuronal and muscular responses to cooling of the posture motor system were analyzed with electrophysiological methods. The motor function of cool-sensitive neurons was discussed. Several efferent axons in each of the first,second and third roots (r 1,r 2 and r 3) of the isolated abdominal ganglia initiated impuless or raised frequency of spontaneous impuless with the cold stimulation. The spontaneous and elicited impulses stopped with warning. The efferent firing pattern of cool-sensitive neurons was tonic. The increase in impulse frequency depended on falling temperature in a range of 0. 5 - 5. 5 ゜C. The response curve to cooling was sigmoid. The maximum frequency of large amplitude impulses was up to 10 Hz while smaller amplitude impuless were higher than 10 Hz in the frequency. These cool-sensitive neurons were present in all abdominal ganglia of the three species,and their firing properties and distribution were homologous to those in thoracic ganglia. These suggest that the cool-sensitive neurons distribute all over the ventral nerver cord of crustaceans living in different temperature conditions. Most silent neurons in an isolated abdominal ganglion were slowly depolarized by cooling (0. 5 mV/゜C). But this depolarization did not result in spiking. A few of the silent neurons (3 %) produced sustained depolarizing potentials with cooling (2. 5 - 3 m V/゜C) and generated action potentials. The cold neurons seemed to be interneurons and interacted synaptically with other interneurons,and some efferent neurons in the ganglion. Judged from the high sensitivity and the distribution of cool-sensitive neurons,the central cold neurons of crustaceans may function as a temperature detector. Moreover,none of temperature receptor on the body surface has been found in crustaceans. Therefore,it is proposed in this study that the abdomonal ganglia may function as a sense organ for both internal and external temperatures. With cooling of the abdominal tonic extensor or flexor muscle (TEM or TFM) associatied with the single ganglion via a thin branch of the r 2 or r 3,firing rate of the nerve increased while the muscle fibers were depolarized. The muscle depolarization by cooling was composed of excitatory junction potentials (EJPs) and slow depolarizing potentials (SDPs). A small component of the SDPs (small SDP, 1 mV/゜C) was attributable to a direct effect of falling temperature on the resting potential. The other component was large (lage SDP, 3 - 5 mV/゜C). Both EJPs and the large SDP disappeared with cutting of the innervating nerve. Thus production of the large SDP was concerned with ganglonic actions. On the other hand,the large SDP was produced by modulation of the small SPD by either serotonin or octopamine,which was thought to be a cotransmitter of the cool-sensitive motoneuron. It was therefore suggested that the muscle depolarization was developed additionally by a modulatory action of the cool-sensitive neurons. The modulatory action on the muscle resting potential (the small SPD) was a new finding in this stidy. In the isolated TEM or TFM,electrical stimulation (2 - 5 Hz) of the innevating never often caused the muscle fibers to depolarize the same degree as cooling. This suggests that the cool-sensitive motoneurons could activate the tonic muscles by both neuromuscular transmission and a hormonal action on the cooling-dependent depolarization (the small SDP). Effects of pericardial hormones (serotonin,octopamine and proctolin) on the ganglion-muscle preparation were also examined. Either serotonin or octopamine had action not only to the muscle but also to the ganglion,and increased the impulese of innervating never. Proctolin directly increased the muscle tension without changing the muscle membrane potentials. It has been suggested that these hormones are releaed with a decrease in body temperature and may reach the abdminal organs (Kuramoto and Tani, 1994). Therefore,the pericardial hormones may additionally activate the posture motor system in vivo and may increase the abdominal tone. It was futher observed that the increase in muscle tention induced either by cooling or by the pericardial hormones was accompanied by an increase in oxygen consumption (metabolism) of the preparation. The present study suggests that the abdominal tone of <b>macruran</b> decapods increases reciprocally to body temperature via the cool-sensitive neurons. The information of abdominal tone is sent to the CNS via stretch receptors located along the tonic muscle. Thus,the raised abdominal tone under the cold may be useful to compensate the reduced contractile ability of the phasic muscles. Moreover,the muscle activation by the cool-sensitive neurons may be further related to an increase of efferent impulses for the other systems. Such multiple activation of the abdominal motor systems may contribute to maintain or increase the metabolic rate for a while when the body temperature is suddenly lowered. Thesis (Ph.
