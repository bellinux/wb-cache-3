Spatiotemporal harmonization of the metal oxide dissolution and the PCP crystallization allowed the preservation of very fine mineral morphological details of periodic alumina inverse opal structures.

Microwave heating is an advanced direct heating method, which has used for thermal desorption (Júnior et al. 2017).

Johannesburg 2013. Tool manufacturing {{played a major role}} in the development and evolution of our species, and by studying the tools left behind by our ancestors we gain valuable insight into their development and behaviours through time. This study was conducted on the Swartkrans Oldowan (2. 2 - 1. 7 Ma), early Acheulean (1. 5 - 1 Ma), and Middle Stone Age (< 110 ka) assemblages to determine the degree of lithic raw <b>material</b> <b>selectivity</b> for making stone tools, and if they practiced ever increasing selection towards better quality stone over time. The presence of quality selection was determined by comparing the various Swartkrans assemblages with experimentally created lithic tools from rock types found in the study area. Three main characteristics that determine selection of rock types were isolated: flaking predictability, durability and sharpness. Analysis of the data provided further evidence that our early stone tool making ancestors had the ability to understand how different rock types behave when knapped and tended to select rocks that had a high flaking predictability, high durability and could produce fairly sharp edges. It was also apparent that they could identify features that diminish the above mentioned characteristics. Variables such as the impurity encounter rate, fracture encounter rate, weathering, grain size and homogeneity were semiquantitatively recorded for the three techno-complexes at Swartkrans and compared to each other to help identify the degree of selectivity that was practiced over time. The data revealed that selection for quality of lithic raw materials was practiced to some extent during the Oldowan and improved slightly in the early Acheulean. The most marked selection for quality was seen for the Middle Stone Age when modern humans used the site. These results indicate that as time progressed in the Sterkfontein valley, and the stone tool technologies became more complex, so too did the selective pressures and thus an increase in selection for quality lithic raw materials over the course of time...|$|E

Their unique properties have enabled their use in a wide range of conservation applications, since they ensure interventions with precise control, <b>material</b> <b>selectivity</b> and immediate feedback. Surface cleaning, based on laser ablation, is a delicate, critical and irreversible process, which, given the multitude of materials that may be present on a CH object and the often fragile or precarious condition of the original surfaces, is fraught with many potential complications. Therefore it is crucial to choose the best possible laser cleaning methodology for each individual case, which involves optimising the laser parameters according to material properties, as well as the thorough knowledge of the ablation mechanisms involved. In this context the systematic investigation and elucidation of potential damage or side effects occurring upon cleaning is essential, as it delineates the possibilities and limitations of laser ablation and allows the fine-tuning of the operating parameters for a successful cleaning intervention. This paper is an overview of studies investigating the mechanisms which are responsible for the laser-induced discoloration effects. Emphasis is given on the yellowing coloration observed on stonework upon infrared (IR) ablation of pollution encrustations, while the various theories introduced to approach the different physical and/or chemical processes and mechanisms responsible for such side effects are discussed. In this respect the different laser cleaning methodologies, which are based on the use of laser systems with different pulse durations and wavelength characteristics, introduced in order to rectify or prevent discoloration on stonework are presented.

40|$|The {{steadily}} increasing mortality due to atherosclerotic diseases {{is a growing}} problem in our society. In this disease the vessel lumen is reduced by deposition of plaques at the wall of blood vessels in combination with smooth muscle cell migration. The treatment of this disorder by means of invasive therapies has become increasingly important in recent decades, so that currently {{more than half a}} million bypass surgeries are performed per year. However, often suitable autologous vessels are missing and the implantation of synthetic substitutes is the only possible therapeutic approach for many patients. Here the surfaces of the artificial materials used are inferior to autologous vessels due to insufficient hemocompatibility. There are many concepts for reducing the thrombogenicity of artificial implants, whereby the generation of a natural anti-thrombogenic layer by colonization with autologous endothelial cells is the most promising strategy. However, the generation of a functional-confluent and shear resistant endothelial cell layer is difficult on many synthetic surfaces, since they do not allow stable endothelialization due to its interfacial properties. Therefore modern endothelialization strategies use low-molecular cell-binding ligands such as peptides, antibodies or aptamers for selective cell recruitment. Since these ligands do not have additional valences for further interaction, covalent immobilization is mostly the only possibility to generate a stable surface functionalization. However, methods used for covalent immobilization can cause adverse effects on the subsequent application like an alteration of the substrate surface or changes in the biological activity of the ligand. An alternative to covalent immobilization would be the use of optimized substrate binding molecules for a stable functionalization, which allow a variety of non-covalent physical interactions on the principle of multivalency in the same manner like cell-binding ligands. The screening for such optimized to the surface of a polymeric biomaterial binding ligands was carried out by means of an on nucleic acids (aptamers) based in vitro selection process. As an ideal candidate material for DNA-ligands polyetherimide (PEI) was selected in the form of films, as it has a variety of valences to interact by physical forces with DNA bases, based on its chemical structure and interface properties. Furthermore this polymer exhibited a comparatively good hemo- and biocompatibility. The in vitro selection for the generation of PEI binding DNA-aptamers resulted in the clarification of thymine dominated binding motive. The preferential interaction of the polymeric surface with thymine was attributed to the chemical structure of the base, which was connected with a decreased electrostatic repulsion of the π-electron system as well as the hydrophobic character maximizing entropy. Despite of a lack of <b>material</b> <b>selectivity</b> with regard to other polymers showing similar macroscopic interfacial properties, the generation of multivalent binding aptamers against the surface of the selected model polymer PEI could be shown. On the basis of these ligands an up to the nanometer range area wide coating of the polymeric substrate could be achieved. In subsequently performed in vitro binding studies it was elucidated, that the aptamer coating was instable under the influence of proteinogenic components in the surrounding fluid. Nevertheless, by adjusting the cell culture system, the non-covalent immobilization of a cell binding ligand, via non-covalent biotin/streptavidin interaction, with the surface bound aptamers was shown in a proof of concept, whereby the initial adherence and shear resistance of endothelial cells was significantly improved compared to the untreated polymer...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Robotic {{grasping}} {{of unknown}} objects is recognized to be a challenging problem; {{this is due}} to the uncertainty of object shape, caused by the imperfect perception capability of the robot. Vision and depth sensors are commonly used to sense objects before grasping. These sensors suffer from shortcomings such as occlusion, inaccurate sensor readings, and failures due to reflection and transparency. Grasping solely relying on an incomplete object shape can fail regardless of the grasp planning. On the other hand, tactile exploration is widely used to acquire local geometric information of the object and does not subject to occlusion. However, since touch sensing relies on physical contact between the manipulator and the object, it tends to unintentionally displace objects, particularly light objects. This dissertation considers "pretouch", a sensing modality that is intermediate in range between long-range depth and tactile sensing. This is potentially beneficial for robotic grasping as it provides reliable geometric information in the last centimeter before contact. In this dissertation, a novel pretouch technique, "seashell effect pretouch", is first presented. It is effective for a set of materials that other pretouch techniques fail to sense. This pretouch modality is inspired by the phenomenon of "hearing the sea" when a seashell is held to the ear; in particular, the observation that the "sound of the sea" changes as the distance from the seashell to the ear varies. It is because environmental noise is amplified the most (attenuated the least) at the cavity's resonant frequency, which changes as the cavity approaches an object. In order to turn the familiar seashell effect into a pretouch sensor, I study the underlying acoustic principle, i. e., the acoustic radiation impedence changes caused by the object being close to the opening of the cavity. The sensor design, including the acoustic properties, hardware/software design, and signal processing, are discussed in detail. The resulting implementation is fully integrated into the finger of a Willow Garage PR 2 robot. The sensor detects resonance frequency shifts in the spectrum of ambient sound, which occur when the finger approaches an object. The performance of the proposed sensor is characterized and evaluated, in terms of the sensing range, accuracy, and its <b>material</b> <b>selectivity.</b> This results in the ability to reliably detect the presence of the object within 5 mm. In addition, a new infrared optical pretouch sensor can be developed, with minimal modification on the proposed sensor system design. The first explored application is detecting extremely compliant objects during grasp execution. In a pre-grasp execution experiment, the ability to detect compliant objects of the seashell effect pretouch sensor is compared with that of a pressure sensor. The results suggest advantages of seashell pretouch over tactile sensing. The second application is pretouch-assisted grasp planning. When the pretouch sensor senses the object during a series of probing motions, it provides points collected by recording the position of end effector on the robot; these additional points augment the point cloud from the depth sensor. This method compensates for object shape, that is otherwise incomplete due to depth sensor failure or occlusion. Furthermore, a unified probabilistic framework is proposed to (1) identify shape uncertainty for the target object; (2) automatically explore the uncertain areas to reduce the uncertainty, resulting in a grasp with higher confidence. In the beginning, the robot is provided with only the incomplete object shape data acquired from a Kinect depth sensor [...] -it does not have a model of the object. Next, combining the Kinect point cloud with prior probability distributions for occlusion and transparency, it makes inferences about unobserved portions of the object. Operating on the inferred shape of the object, an iterative grasp replanning algorithm decides whether further exploration is required, and where to explore in the scene. The information gathered by the exploration action is added directly to the environment representation in real-time and hence considered in the next grasp planning iteration. Experimental results showed that, the robot is able to grasp partially transparent objects with a high success rate of 96 %. Finally, I propose to augment streaming point cloud data with the seashell effect pretouch information. This is inspired by the use case of haptic rendering in a telerobotic grasping scenario. The non-contact seashell-effect pretouch sensor fixed to the robot end effector is used to sense physical geometries within the vicinity of the sensor. Thus, the point cloud representation of an unknown environment, which may be sparse or poorly visible, is enhanced through telerobotic exploration/sensing in real-time. Furthurmore, real-time haptic rendering algorithms are applied on the augmented point clouds to create haptic virtual fixtures, and also provide haptic force feedback to the operator. This method provides the teleoperator with critical geometrical information about the grasp target, while preventing the robot end effector from collision. The augmented virual environment after the pretouch exploration represents more complete object shapes, which helps the operator align the gripper on the slave robot with the target object for grasping...|$|E
40|$|Ion {{channels}} {{play key}} roles in functions and dysfunctions of all cells. Single channel recording methods using planar (black) lipid membranes (BLM) and patch clamp techniques {{are widely used}} at present, {{but they are not}} suited for automation and miniaturization. Therefore, in order to develop electrophysiology library arrays, several groups have recently reported on wafer-based devices that can replace the more traditional glass pipettes and Teflon partitions that are employed for investigating ion channels activities in cells and artificial membrane. The supported planar lipid bilayer (SPLB) is a lipid bilayer supported on solid surfaces. Concerning the ion-channel biosensors, single ion channel recording has been succeeded in suspended membranes made by the painting method on micro-machined supports. In the case of the suspended membrane, {{it is not easy to}} make a single bilayer with a small pore diameter (several μm), which is necessary for high speed recording and low noises. In the SPLBs made by vesicle fusion however, single channel recording have not yet been reported. The SPLB on the silicon based microelectrode are extremely attractive since small pore can be easily made, thus it has a potential of high stability, high sensitivity and high density of integration. It is considered that a major challenge in the production of tightly sealed bilayers to reduce leakage currents to the levels found in the suspended membrane, and most likely, this will require the reduction of the substrate surface roughness and the elimination of edge effects. The efforts to get high resistivity in the tethered supported membrane on Au surface have been done by several groups. Recently, the tethered lipid bilayers with a high electrical resistance of ~ 130 MΩ and the subsequent detection of only a few synthetic ligand-gated ion channels incorporated in the tethered lipid bilayer, have been reported.

Langmuir 19 (2003) 5567] In spite of these efforts, it is clear that a much higher resistivity (GΩ seal) is required to realize a supported membrane biosensor which can be applied to the single ion channel recording. 　　In the present thesis, based on these backgrounds, I have developed several elementary processes to realize an ideal SPLB with GΩ resistance on Si-based microelectrodes. I have developed the techniques to fabricate a hole (well) with a diameter of about 1 μm for microelectrodes on a SiO 2 /CoSi 2 /Si substrate, while maintaining the SiO 2 surface roughness at less than 1 nm using a femtosecond laser microfabrication technique and synchrotron radiation etching. The SPLB membrane was formed on the surface of a microelectrode area by the fusion of giant unilamellar vesicles. I have characterized the stability, electrical resistance, capacitance, and current noise of the bilayers. 　　After the deposition of Co on the Si(100) surface, the SiO 2 thin film consists of spin on glass (SOG) (400 nm thickness) and sputtered SiO 2 (200 nm thickness) was formed on the Co/Si. Then by annealing at 540 =℃ for 10 min, the Co/Si layer was changed to CoSi 2 keeping the SiO 2 surface roughness less than 1 nm. A 300 nm of Co layer was deposited on the SiO 2 surface by sputtering as an etching contact mask and circular patterns were made on the Co mask using the femto-second laser ablation. The SR etching of the SiO 2 layer to make the wells on the electrode was carried out at the beam line 4 A 2 of the SR facility (UVSOR) at the Institute for Molecular Science, using a mixture of SF 6 (0. 05 Torr) and O 2 (0. 002 Torr) as an etching gas. The SR etching results in a vertical wall and completely stops at the surface of the CoSi 2 /Si(100). SR was used because of its unique features such as high spatial resolution, extremely high <b>material</b> <b>selectivity</b> between CoSi 2 and SiO 2, anisotropic etching, low damage, and clean etching atmosphere. Finally the Co contact mask was removed without damaging the substrate by immersion into 0. 1 M HNO 3 aq. AFM images of the SiO 2 surface after the removal of the Co mask showed that the surface was very flat (R a = 0. 8 nm), which is essential for the formation of the defect-free SPLB on the surface. 　　Ag (50 nm) was deposited by electroplating on the surface of CoSi 2 which was exposed at the bottom of the etched well. Then the surface of the Ag was changed into AgCl also by electroplating. The giant unilamellar vesicles were prepared by adding a buffer solution (10 mM KCl, pH = 6. 6) to vacuum-dried films of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn- 3 -phosphor- L-Serin (POPS) (9 : 1, w/w) and agitating at RT. Mixing of negatively charged lipid POPS to neutral lipid DPPC was essentially effective to form unilamellar giant vesicles without aggregation. Formation of SPLB covering the well-type electrode by the rapture of the giant vesicle was confirmed by fluorescence microscope. When substrates are immersed in an aqueous solution of lipid vesicles, the vesicles adhere to the surface, rupture, and spread to form a bilayer on hydrophilic surfaces of SiO 2. It has been suggested that a thin water layer approximately 1 - 2 nm is trapped between the support and the headgroups of the lower leaflet of the bilayer. [Bayerl, T. M.; Bloom, M. Biophysical Journal, 58 (1990) 357] 　　Fluorescence microscopy images showed that the diameter of the SPLB formed on the SiO 2 /Si(100) surface by the rapture of the giant vesicles was typically about 150 ~ 300 μEm, large enough to cover the electrode area (10 μEm ~ 30 μEm diameter). AFM images of the bilayer showed that the thickness of the SPLB membrane was 4. 5 nm, corresponding to the height of a single bilayer. The electric characteristics were measured by a patch clamp amplifier through the AgCl/Ag electrode. The resistances before and after the lipid bilayer formation were 10 ± 3 MΩ and 1. 2 GΩ, respectively. This confirmed the GΩ seal formation of SPLB on the microelectrodes. The capacitance of the bilayer measured by using a patch clamp amplifier was 10. 7 pF. These values were observed with extremely good reproducibility during our experiments for more than 5 hours. 　　Although the resistance value fulfills the condition required for the measurement of single channel measurements, even then it is much smaller than those (> 30 GΩ) realized in the planer or suspended membranes. This may be due to the edge leak current. Therefore, by depressing the edge leak current, much higher resistance of lipid bilayer is expected to be obtained. 　　I have considered to use the hydrophobic self-assembled monolayers (SAM) as a “guard ring” to reduce the edge leak current of SPLB. I have developed a patterning method of octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) SAM by photo-lithography and UV ashing. OTS-SAM were formed on the sputtered SiO 2 surface by immersing the sample into a 1. 0 mM solution of OTS in toluene for 10 s at 22 ℃. Then negative resist (7 μEm height) pattern was made with lithography technique. After 30 min of UV ashing, resist pattern was removed with remover. The OTS-SAM on the open area, which was not covered with the resist, were completely removed by UV ashing, while no change was observed in the OTS-SAM on the area covered with the resist. The height of the OTS-SAM was ~ 2. 5 nm and the roughness of the SiO 2 surface without OTS-SAM was R a = 0. 8 nm. SPLB was formed on this patterned OTS-SAM by rapture of giant unilamellar vesicles. AFM and fluorescence microscopy images have shown that SPLB forms bilayer on hydrophilic SiO 2 surfaces and a monolayer on OTS-SAM hydrophobic surfaces. This technique has been considered to use for the formation of tightly sealed bilayers to reduce leakage current of the SPLB...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{focuses on}} the problems that the ECJ has found in recent cases at applying the classic three step selectivity test {{in the area of}} taxation. The Court is confronted with the Member States’ attempt to circumvent the State aid rules by creating ad hoc general tax systems so there is no general system against which the tax measures can be assessed. In order to avoid this circumvention, the ECJ has shifted its case law on <b>material</b> tax <b>selectivity</b> towards a new “comparability test” (also called “equality test”) based on a non-formalistic approach which takes into account the underlying objectives of the tax measure. This “comparability test” encompasses an objectives-based approach which provides Member States a higher degree of freedom. However it seems to be rather vague because it involves the difficult task of distinguishing permissible goals from impermissible goals which irretrievably leads us to a case-by-case analysis which does not provide the desirable degree of legal certainty and predictability. The main conclusion of this research is that the criterion of <b>material</b> tax <b>selectivity</b> is not definitively formulated in the ECJ case law but, on the contrary, it is open to refinements {{in order to meet the}} challenges that current and future State aid cases may raise.
