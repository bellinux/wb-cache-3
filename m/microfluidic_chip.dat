40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{discovery}} of DNA, biologists have been striving to unravel its mysteries. Many efforts have been made {{over the years to}} further our understanding of genes, what they do and how they function. Genomes exist as a 3 D structure inside the nucleus and they are not randomly arranged. However, there are still many gaps in the knowledge of how the structure fills this 3 D space. Using chromosome conformation capture (3 C) and other methods based on proximity ligation, interactions between different sections on the chromosome can be captured. A computer simulated 3 D chromosome model can then be created based on the interaction data. Currently, global interaction maps can only be created for populations of cells. The overall goal of this research is to develop a protocol that will enable the capture of chromosome interactions within a single cell. This requires the use of <b>microfluidic</b> <b>chips</b> due to the minute quantity of DNA within a single cell. Therefore the main objectives of this research are to: 1) build and test a microfluidic system (lab-on-a-chip or LOC) that will aid in the capture of interand intra- chromosomal interactions of a single cell; and 2) characterize the restriction and ligation of DNA that will be performed in a microfluidic system. In order to assess the efficiency of DNA digestion within <b>microfluidic</b> <b>chips,</b> EcoRI and MspI digestion kinetics within microtubes is first characterized to establish a base line for comparison with digestion kinetics within <b>microfluidic</b> <b>chips.</b> The Km, Vmax and Kcat for EcoRI within microtubes are 32 nM, 0. 14 nM s- 1 and 1. 4 fmol s- 1 U- 1 respectively. The Km, Vmax and Kcat for MspI within microtubes are 125 nM, 1. 46 nM s- 1 and 29. 2 fmol s- 1 U- 1 respectively. On the other hand, the digestion kinetics within <b>microfluidic</b> <b>chips</b> is undetermined, because both restriction enzymes exhibit non-specific nuclease activity within <b>microfluidic</b> <b>chips</b> under the conditions tested. The exhibition of non-specific nuclease activity is unexpected and causes ligation of DNA performed in <b>microfluidic</b> <b>chips</b> to fail. The non-specific nuclease activity of EcoRI and MspI within <b>microfluidic</b> <b>chips</b> is also problematic for the overall goal of developing a protocol that will enable the capture of chromosome interactions within a single cell, because the non-specific nuclease activity would cause loss of template and random variations in results obtained...|$|R

Biomolecules, such as DNA, RNA or proteins, can be individually tethered between the microspheres and a surface and then probed by the acoustic forces exerted by the piezo sensor.

With AFS devices {{it is possible to}} apply forces ranging from 0 to several hundreds of picoNewtons on hundreds of microspheres and obtain force-extension curves or histograms of rupture forces of many individual events in parallel.|$|E
50|$|Uwe Marx (born 26 June 1964 in Berlin) is a German {{physician}} and biotechnologist, {{and is one}} of the world's leading researchers in the fields of organ-on-a-chip technology and antibody production.

40|$|We {{report a}} fast and simple {{prototyping}} method to fabricate polymer-based <b>microfluidic</b> <b>chips</b> using Direct Laser Plotting (DLP) technique, by which various functional micro-structures {{can be realized}} within minutes, in a mask-free and out-of-cleanroom fashion. A 2 D Computer-Aid-Design (CAD) software was employed to layout the required micro-structures and micro-channels, a CO 2 laser plotter was then used to construct the microstructures. The desired patterns can be plotted directly on PDMS substrates and bio-compatible polymer films by manipulating the strength and density of laser pulses. With the DLP technique, chip-embedded micro-electrodes, micro-mixers and 3 D <b>microfluidic</b> <b>chips</b> with 5 layers, which normally require several days of work in a cleanroom facility, can be fabricated in minutes in common laboratory. This novel method can produce microfluidic channels with average feature size of 100 mu m. while feature size of 50 mu m or smaller is achievable by making use of the interference effect from laser impulsion. In this report, we present the optimized parameters for successful fabrication of 3 D microchannels, micro-mixers and <b>microfluidic</b> <b>chips</b> for protein concentration measurements (Bovine Serum Albumine (BSA) test), and a novel procedure to pattern flexible embedding electrodes on PDMS-based <b>microfluidic</b> <b>chips.</b> DLP offers a convenient and low cost alternative to conventional microfluidic channel fabrication technique which relies on complicated and hazardous soft lithography process.

40|$|<b>Microfluidic</b> <b>chips</b> {{have become}} a {{powerful}} tool in research where biological cells are processed and/or analyzed. One method for contactless cell manipulation in <b>microfluidic</b> <b>chips</b> that has gained an increasing amount of attention the last decade is ultrasonic standing wave (USW) technology. This Thesis explores the biocompatibility of USW technology applied to <b>microfluidic</b> <b>chips,</b> and presents a novel USW-based method for serial processing and accurate characterization of living cells. The biocompatibility has been investigated by measuring the proliferation rate of cells after they had been trapped and aggregated inside a chip by ultrasound. No negative influence was observed after continuous exposure to 0. 85 MPa pressure amplitudes for up to 75 min. Furthermore, the heat generation in the fluid channel caused by the ultrasound has been measured and used in a regulation scheme where the temperature can be controlled around any relevant temperature (e. g. 378 Ì 9) with Â± 0. 18 Ì 9 accuracy for more than 12 hours. The proliferation rate and temperature investigations suggest that USW technology applied to <b>microfluidic</b> <b>chips</b> is a biocompatiblemethod useful for long-term handling of living cells. We have introduced a new concept of contactless ultrasonic âcagingâ of single cells or small aggregates of cells. These cages are channel segments in the <b>microfluidic</b> <b>chips</b> that are geometrically designed to resonate at one or several actuation frequencies. The actuation is performed remotely by up to five external frequency specific wedge transducers, where each transducer produces a localized and spatially confined standing wave with a specific orientation of its corresponding radiation force field. By multi-frequency actuation, sophisticated and flexible force fields are realized by both overlapping and separated single fields. The Thesis describes two different cages: A sub-mm âmicro-cageâ for tree-dimensional manipulationof single cells, and a 5 -mm âmini-cageâ for selective retention of small cell aggregates (up to approx. 10 ^ 3 cells) from a continuously feeding sample flow. Finally,our <b>microfluidic</b> <b>chips</b> were also designed to be compatible with high-resolution optical microscopy. We have demonstrated sub-Î¼m-resolution confocal fluorescence and trans-illumination microscopy imaging of ultrasonically caged living cells. QC 2010081...|$|R

50|$|The {{use of a}} glow {{discharge}} for solution of certain mapping problems was described in 2002. According to a Nature news article describing the work, researchers at Imperial College London demonstrated how they built a mini-map that gives tourists luminous route indicators. To make the one-inch London chip, the team etched a plan of the city centre on a glass slide. Fitting a flat lid over the top turned the streets into hollow, connected tubes. They filled these with helium gas, and inserted electrodes at key tourist hubs. When a voltage is applied between two points, electricity naturally runs through the streets along the shortest route from A to B - and the gas glows like a tiny glowing strip light. The approach itself provides a novel visible analog computing approach for solving a wide class of maze searching problems based on the properties of lighting up of a {{glow discharge}} in a <b>microfluidic</b> <b>chip.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} thermal cyclers {{were designed}} for use with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Since this enzyme is destroyed during each heating step of the amplification process, new enzyme had to be added every cycle. This led to a cumbersome machine based on an automated pipettor, with open reaction tubes. Later, the PCR process was adapted {{to the use of}} thermostable DNA polymerase from Thermus aquaticus, which greatly simplified the design of the thermal cycler. While in some old machines the block is submerged in an oil bath to control temperature, in modern PCR machines a Peltier element is commonly used. Quality thermal cyclers often contain silver blocks to achieve fast temperature changes and uniform temperature throughout the block. Other cyclers have multiple blocks with high heat capacity, each of which is kept at a constant temperature, and the reaction tubes are moved between them by means of an automated process. Miniaturized thermal cyclers have been created in which the reaction mixture moves via channel through hot and cold zones on a <b>microfluidic</b> <b>chip.</b> Thermal cyclers designed for quantitative PCR have optical systems which enable fluorescence to be monitored during reaction cycling.|$|E

40|$|Separation {{methods have}} been {{miniaturized}} in recent years. Capillary electrophoresis is now common {{and other types of}} analyses are being done on <b>microfluidic</b> <b>chips</b> with capillary channels in lieu of wider column diameters. The surfaces of the media used for separation are chemically modified. Using infrared spectroscopy by a microscope attachment, attempts were made to characterize the surfaces of both capillary channels and modified polymer for <b>microfluidic</b> <b>chips.</b> FTIR microscopy is not common in this type of analysis and is normally used to analyze particles, such as fibers, paint, and other polymer sources. Since modification of miniaturized chemical media is done on a microscopic scale, the FTIR microscope seemed promising for the detection of these changes. However, there was great difficulty in detecting the target material against the background material. Thus, micro-infrared spectroscopy is not an ideal method for characterizing modified separation media, despite its ability to sample small areas. Additionally, a novel medium for <b>microfluidic</b> <b>chips,</b> a material made of polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS), was described.
