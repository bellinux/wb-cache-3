The most likely mechanisms for bubble formation are tribonucleation, when two surfaces <b>make</b> <b>and</b> <b>break</b> contact (such as in joints), and heterogeneous nucleation, where bubbles are created {{at a site}} based on a surface {{in contact with the}} liquid. Homogeneous nucleation, where bubbles form within the liquid itself is less likely because it requires much greater pressure differences than experienced in decompression. The spontaneous formation of nanobubbles on hydrophobic surfaces is a possible source of micronuclei, but it is not yet clear if these can grow large enough to cause symptoms as they are very stable.|$|E

25|$|The five-needle telegraph, {{which was}} mainly, if not entirely, due to Wheatstone, {{was similar to}} that of Schilling, and based on the {{principle}} enunciated by André-Marie Ampère – that is to say, the current was sent into the line by completing the circuit of the battery with a <b>make</b> <b>and</b> <b>break</b> key, and at the other end it passed through a coil of wire surrounding a magnetic needle free to turn round its centre. According as one pole of the battery or the other was applied to the line by means of the key, the current deflected the needle to one side or the other. There were five separate circuits actuating five different needles. The latter were pivoted in rows across the middle of a dial shaped like a diamond, and having the letters of the alphabet arranged upon {{it in such a way}} that a letter was literally pointed out by the current deflecting two of the needles towards it.|$|E

2500|$|After World War II, amateur radio {{operators}} in the US started to receive obsolete but usable Teletype Model 26 equipment from commercial operators {{with the understanding}} that this equipment would not be used for or returned to commercial service. [...] "The Amateur Radioteletype and VHF Society" [...] was founded in 1946 in Woodside, NY. This organization soon changed its name to [...] "The VHF Teletype Society" [...] and started US Amateur Radio operations on 2 meters using audio frequency shift keying (AFSK). The first two-way amateur radioteletype QSO of record took place in May 1946 between Dave Winters, W2AUF, Brooklyn, NY and W2BFD, John Evans Williams, Woodside Long Island, NY. On the west coast, amateur RTTY also started on 2 meters. Operation on 80 meters, 40 meters and the other High Frequency (HF) amateur radio bands was initially accomplished using <b>make</b> <b>and</b> <b>break</b> keying since frequency shift keying (FSK) was not yet authorized. In early 1949, the first American transcontinental two-way RTTY QSO was accomplished on 11 meters using AFSK between Tom McMullen (W1QVF) operating at W1AW and Johnny Agalsoff, W6PSW. The stations effected partial contact on January 30, 1949, and repeated more successfully on January 31. On February 1, 1949, the stations exchanged solid print congratulatory message traffic and rag-chewed. Earlier, on January 23, 1949, William T. Knott, W2QGH, Larchmont, NY, had been able to make rough copy of W6PSW's test transmissions. While QSOs could be accomplished, it was quickly realized that FSK was technically superior to <b>make</b> <b>and</b> <b>break</b> keying. Due to the efforts of Merrill Swan, W6AEE, of [...] "The RTTY Society of Southern California" [...] publisher of RTTY and Wayne Green, W2NSD, of CQ Magazine, Amateur Radio operators successfully petitioned the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to amend Part 12 of the Regulations, which was effective on February 20, 1953. The amended Regulations permitted FSK in the non-voice parts of the 80, 40 and 20 meter bands and also specified the use of single channel 60 words-per-minute five unit code corresponding to ITA2. A shift of 850 hertz plus or minus 50 hertz was specified. Amateur Radio operators also had to identify their station callsign at {{the beginning and the end}} of each transmission and at ten-minute intervals using International Morse code. Use of this wide shift proved to be a problem for Amateur Radio operations. Commercial operators had already discovered that narrow shift worked best on the HF bands. After investigation and a petition to the FCC, Part 12 was amended, in March 1956, to allow Amateur Radio Operators to use any shift that was less than 900 hertz.|$|E

5000|$|The {{telegraph}} sounder {{was used}} at {{the receiving end of}} the line to make the Morse code message audible. Its simple mechanism was similar to a relay. It consisted of an electromagnet attached to the telegraph line, with an iron armature near the magnet's pole balanced on a pivot, held up by a counterweight. When current flowed through the electromagnet's winding, it created a magnetic field which attracted the armature, pulling it down to the electromagnet, resulting in a [...] "click" [...] sound. When the current ended, the counterweight pulled the armature back up to its resting position, resulting in a [...] "clack" [...] sound. Thus, as the telegraph key at the sending end <b>makes</b> <b>and</b> <b>breaks</b> the contact, the sounder echoes the up and down state of the key.|$|R

6000|$|... 1073. The fact is, {{that under}} many {{variations}} of the experiments, the permanent current loses in force as the effects upon breaking contact become exalted. This is abundantly evident in the comparative experiments with long and short wires (1068.); and is still more strikingly shown by the following variation. Solder {{an inch or two}} in length of fine platina wire (about one-hundredth of an inch in diameter) on to one end of the long communicating wire, and also a similar length of the same platina wire on to one end of the short communication; then, in comparing the effects of these two communications, <b>make</b> <b>and</b> <b>break</b> contact between the platina terminations and the mercury of the cup G or E (1079.). When the short wire is used, the platina will be ignited by the constant current, because of the quantity of electricity, but the spark on breaking contact will be hardly visible; on using the longer communicating wire, which by obstructing will diminish the current, the platina will remain cold whilst the current passes, but give a bright spark at the moment it ceases: thus the strange result is obtained of a diminished spark and shock from the strong current, and increased effects from the weak one. Hence the spark and shock at the moment of disjunction, although resulting from great intensity and quantity, of the current at that moment, are no direct indicators or measurers of the intensity or quantity of the constant current previously passing, and by which they are ultimately produced.|$|E
