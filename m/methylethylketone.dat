40|$|The {{influence}} of the organic solvents widely used in the pharmaceutical industry (acetone, <b>methylethylketone,</b> ethanol, and isopropanol) both in the presence {{and in the absence}} of water on the crystallization behavior of erythromycin (Em), a clinically relevant antibiotic of the macrolide group, was investigated. It was observed that despite a high preference for water as a guest molecule, Em rather easily forms solvates with the organic solvents studied. Consequently, 4 distinct solvates of Em have been isolated by recrystallization: acetonate, methylethylketonate, ethanolate, and isopropanolate. It was established that in a pure organic solvent, or 1 ∶ 9 or 1 ∶ 1 water-organic solvent mixtures, the corresponding solvate is always crystallized. However, the recrystallization of erythromycin from 2 ∶ 1 water-organic solvent (excluding <b>methylethylketone)</b> mixture results in the formation of a crystal hydrate form. X-ray powder diffraction revealed the isostructurality of the solvates with acetone and <b>methylethylketone.</b> Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the loss of volatiles by all of the solvated crystals is nonstoichiometric. The desolvation behavior of the solvates with the organic solvents studied by means of variable-temperature x-ray powder diffraction indicates that in contrast to erythromycin dihydrate, they belong to a different class of solvates—those that produce an amorphous material upon desolvation...|$|E

Also, some organic or inorganic additives - called fillers - which are used with the polyester in order to decrease cost, affect the curing of the polyester. In this work the effect of residual catalyst on the curing of unsaturated polyester is studied. Unsaturated polyesters were prepared using propylene glycol with a 10 % molar excess over stoichiometry and a mixture of dicarboxylic acids, namely maleic acid (unsaturated) adipic acid (saturated) and phthalic anhydride (saturated) at a molar ratio 1 : 2 : 2. Lead dioxide, p-toluenesulfonic acid and zinc acetate were used as catalysts, at 0. 1 % w/w. After the polyesterification, the polymers were diluted with styrene at a proportion of 100 : 30 w/w. The resins were cured by using MEKP (<b>methylethylketone</b> peroxide) as initiator and CoNp (cobalt naphthenate) as accelerator. Catalysts affect the final color of the polyester. The kinetics of curing of the resins was studied by DSC analysis based on the exothermic peak due to the double bonds breaking to give crosslinked macromolecules. The heat released DeltaH is decreased by the presence of catalyst, while activation energy, the frequency factor and the order of reaction are increased...|$|E
40|$|Poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoethylene) electrospun {{membranes}} {{were obtained}} from a blend of dimethylformamide (DMF) and <b>methylethylketone</b> (MEK) solvents. The inclusion of the MEK to the solvent system promotes a faster solvent evaporation allowing complete polymer crystallization during the jet travelling between the tip and the grounded collector. Several processing parameters were systematically changed to study their influence on fiber dimensions. Applied voltage and inner needle diameter do not have large influence on the electrospun fiber average diameter but in the fiber diameter distribution. On the other hand, the increase of {{the distance between the}} needle tip to collector results in fibers with larger average diameter. Independently on the processing conditions, all mats are produced in the electroactive phase of the polymer. Further, MC- 3 T 3 -E 1 cell adhesion was not inhibited by the fiber mats preparation, indicating their potential use for biomedical applications.

40|$|A {{new method}} {{allowing}} the labelling of fibrinogen with 99 mTcO 4 -is described. The 99 mTcO 4 -is reduced by stannous chloride in an alkaline medium. After 1 h incubation with fibrinogen, the pH was brought down to 7. 1. The study of (1) the pH of the solution, (2) {{the quantity of}} the reducer, and (3) the time of incubation allowed us to specify optimal conditions for labeling. The labeling yield varied from 91. 68 %± 6. 05 % to 95. 18 %± 2. 13 % according to the method of control used: the precipitation of fibrinogen by (NH 4) 2 SO 4 25 % or thin-layer chromatography with <b>methylethylketone</b> as solvent. Clottable radioactivity averaged 72 %± 4. 43 %. Column chromatography separated the tracer into two radioactive peaks. The first peak corresponded to the fibrinogen and carried 73. 36 %± 5. 8 % of the total radioactivity. The total recovered radioactivity amounted to 89. 86 %± 8. 07 %. Spectroscopic clottability was 88. 23 %± 2. 42 %. The in vivo stability of the labeling and the molecule was followed for 24 h after intravenous injection. If the radioactivity measured in the 5 min sample was considered to equal 100 %, the 24 h sample averaged 32. 71 %± 3. 25 %, of which 85. 68 %± 2. 92 % was recovered in the clot. In conclusion, this method enabled us to obtain a stable tracer that we used for routine investigations in man. © 1978 Spriger-Verlag. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Protein {{tyrosine}} phosphatase 1 B (PTP 1 B) plays a {{major role}} in the negative regulation of insulin signaling, and is thus considered as an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes. Bioassay-guided investigation of the <b>methylethylketone</b> extract of marine-derived fungus Penicillium sp. JF- 55 cultures afforded a new PTP 1 B inhibitory styrylpyrone-type metabolite named penstyrylpyrone (1), and two known metabolites, anhydrofulvic acid (2) and citromycetin (3). Compounds 1 and 2 inhibited PTP 1 B activity in a dose-dependent manner, and kinetic analyses of PTP 1 B inhibition suggested that these compounds inhibited PTP 1 B activity in a competitive manner. In an effort to gain more biological potential of the isolated compounds, the anti-inflammatory effects of compounds 1 – 3 were also evaluated. Among the tested compounds, only compound 1 inhibited the production of NO and PGE 2, due to the inhibition of the expression of iNOS and COX- 2. Penstyrylpyrone (1) also reduced TNF-α and IL- 1 β production, and these anti-inflammatory effects were shown to be correlated with the suppression of the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB-α, NF-κB nuclear translocation, and NF-κB DNA binding activity. In addition, using inhibitor tin protoporphyrin (SnPP), an inhibitor of HO- 1, it was verified that the inhibitory effects of penstyrylpyrone (1) on the pro-inflammatory mediators and NF-κB DNA binding activity were associated with the HO- 1 expression. Therefore, these results suggest that penstyrylpyrone (1) suppresses PTP 1 B activity, as well as the production of pro-inflammatory mediators via NF-κB pathway, through expression of anti-inflammatory HO- 1...|$|E
