5|$|As {{a member}} of the House Ways and <b>Means</b> <b>Committee</b> and former {{chairman}} of the Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures, Neal is an influential figure in House economic policy. He has also dedicated much of his career to US–Ireland relations and maintaining American involvement in the Northern Ireland peace process, for which he has won several acclamations. He has a generally liberal voting record, but is considered a moderate on such issues as abortion and trade.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, {{with the}} Republicans in the majority, McKinley sought {{election}} as Speaker of the House. He failed {{to gain the}} post, which went to Thomas B. Reed of Maine; however, Speaker Reed appointed McKinley chairman of the Ways and <b>Means</b> <b>Committee.</b> The Ohioan guided the McKinley Tariff of 1890 through Congress; although McKinley's work was altered through the influence of special interests in the Senate, it imposed a number of protective tariffs on foreign goods.|$|E

5|$|On September 3, 2009, The Washington Post {{called on}} Rangel to resign his {{chairmanship}} of the House Ways and <b>Means</b> <b>Committee,</b> given the ethical issues that had surfaced. Another Republican resolution was put forth to force {{him out of his}} chairmanship. However, Rangel stayed in place and mostly maintained his role in House leadership and policy discussions, including the Obama health care reform plan (opposition to which, he suggested, was partly due to racial prejudice against President Obama). Nevertheless, his influence was diminished by the questions surrounding him.|$|E
5|$|Carlisle {{selected}} William Ralls Morrison, another tariff reformer, to {{lead the}} Ways and <b>Means</b> <b>committee,</b> but allowed Randall {{to take charge of}} Appropriations. Morrison's committee produced a bill proposing tariff reductions of 20%; Randall opposed the idea from the start, as did the Republicans. Another bout of illness kept Randall away from Congress at a crucial time in April 1884, and the tariff bill passed a procedural hurdle by just two votes. Two days later, Randall's Appropriations committee reported several funding bills with his support. Many Democrats who had voted for Morrison's tariff were thereby reminded that Randall had the power to defeat spending that was important to them; when the final vote came, enough switched sides to join with Republicans in defeating the reform 156 to 151.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} session of the 33rd Congress, Breckinridge acted as {{spokesman}} for Ways and <b>Means</b> <b>Committee</b> bills, including a bill to assume and pay the debts Texas incurred prior to its annexation. Breckinridge's friends, W. W. Corcoran and Jesse D. Bright, were two of Texas's major creditors. The bill, which was approved, paid only those debts related to powers Texas surrendered to Congress upon annexation. Breckinridge was disappointed that the House defeated a measure to pay the Sioux $12,000 owed them for the 1839 purchase of {{an island in the}} Mississippi River; the debt was never paid. Another increase in the subsidy to the Collins Line passed over his opposition, but Pierce vetoed it.|$|E

5|$|Of 234 {{representatives in}} the House, Breckinridge was one of 80 re-elected to the Thirty-third Congress. His {{relative}} seniority, and Pierce's election, increased his influence. He was rumored to have Pierce's backing for Speaker of the House, but he again deferred to Boyd; Maryland's Augustus R. Sollers spoiled Boyd's unanimous election by voting for Breckinridge. Still not given a committee chairmanship, {{he was assigned to}} the Ways and <b>Means</b> <b>Committee,</b> where he secured passage of a bill to cover overspending in fiscal year 1853–1854; {{it was the only time}} in his career that he solely managed a bill. His attempts to increase Kentucky's allocation in a rivers and harbors bill were unsuccessful but popular with his Whig constituents.|$|E
5|$|Of the 234 {{members of}} the House, Breckinridge was among the 80 that were {{returned}} to their seats for the Thirty-third Congress. Due to his increased seniority, {{he was assigned to}} the more prestigious Ways and <b>Means</b> <b>Committee,</b> but he was not given a committee chairmanship as many had expected. Although he supported Pierce's pro-slavery agenda on the principle of states' rights and believed that secession was legal, he opposed secession as a remedy to the country's immediate problems. This, coupled with his earlier support of manumission and African colonization, balanced his support for slavery; most still considered him a moderate legislator.|$|E
5|$|Sereno E. Payne, {{chairman}} of the House Ways and <b>Means</b> <b>Committee,</b> had held hearings in late 1908, and sponsored the resulting draft legislation. On balance, the bill reduced tariffs slightly, but when it passed the House in April 1909 and reached the Senate, the {{chairman of}} the Senate Finance Committee, Rhode Island Senator Nelson W. Aldrich, attached many amendments raising rates. This outraged progressives such as Wisconsin's Robert M. La Follette, who urged Taft to say that the bill was not in accord with the party platform. Taft refused, angering them. Taft insisted that most imports from the Philippines be free of duty, and according to Anderson, showed effective leadership on a subject he was knowledgeable on and cared about.|$|E

5|$|Tariffs {{had been}} raised to high levels during the Civil War. Afterwards, Garfield, who made a close study of {{financial}} affairs, advocated moving towards free trade, though the standard Republican position was a protective tariff that would allow American industries to grow. This break with his party likely cost him his place on the Ways and <b>Means</b> <b>Committee</b> in 1867, and though Republicans held {{the majority in the}} House until 1875, Garfield remained off that committee during that time. Garfield came to chair the powerful House Appropriations Committee, but it was Ways and Means, with its influence over fiscal policy, that he really wanted to lead. Part of the reason Garfield was denied a place on Ways and Means was the opposition of the influential Republican editor, Horace Greeley.|$|E
5|$|To fund this army, Hamilton wrote {{regularly}} to Oliver Wolcott Jr., his successor at the Treasury William Loughton Smith, of the House Ways and <b>Means</b> <b>Committee</b> and Senator Theodore Sedgwick of Massachusetts. He directed them {{to pass a}} direct tax to fund the war. Smith resigned in July 1797, as Hamilton scolded him for slowness, and told Wolcott to tax houses instead of land. The eventual program included a Stamp Act {{like that of the}} British before the Revolution and other taxes on land, houses, and slaves, calculated at different rates in different states, and requiring difficult and intricate assessment of houses. This provoked resistance in southeastern Pennsylvania, led primarily by men such as John Fries who had marched with Washington against the Whiskey Rebellion.|$|E
5|$|When {{war began}} in April 1861, Stevens {{argued that the}} Confederates were revolutionaries, to be crushed by force. He also {{believed}} that the Confederacy had placed itself beyond {{the protection of the}} U.S. Constitution by making war, and in a reconstituted United States, slavery would have no place. Speaker Galusha Grow, whose views placed him with Stevens among the members becoming known as the Radical Republican (for their position on slavery, as opposed to the Conservative or Moderate Republicans), appointed him as chairman of the House Ways and <b>Means</b> <b>Committee.</b> This position gave him power over the House's agenda.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of Stanley's {{election}} to the House, the American Tobacco Company had eliminated all its substantial competitors either by acquisition or by driving them out of business. The company worked with British tobacco manufacturers to set tobacco prices worldwide. Congressman Stanley came {{to the defense of}} the tobacco farmers of his district, making him virtually unbeatable as a congressional candidate. In the first of his five consecutive terms, he authored a bill that would remove an oppressive national tobacco tax, hoping this would help raise prices for unprocessed tobacco. The bill was defeated by extensive lobbying efforts by the American Tobacco Company. In 1904, he convinced the Ways and <b>Means</b> <b>Committee</b> to hold public hearings on the American Tobacco Company's monopolistic actions, but the hearings did not convince legislators to repeal the tax nor take action against the American Tobacco Company.|$|E
5|$|FairTax proponents {{argue that}} the {{proposal}} would provide tax burden visibility and reduce compliance and efficiency costs by 90%, returning {{a large share of}} money to the productive economy. The Beacon Hill Institute concluded that the FairTax would save $346.51 billion in administrative costs and would be a much more efficient taxation system. Bill Archer, former head of the House Ways and <b>Means</b> <b>Committee,</b> asked Princeton University Econometrics to survey 500 European and Asian companies regarding the effect on their business decisions if the United States enacted the FairTax. 400 of those companies stated they would build their next plant in the United States, and 100 companies said they would move their corporate headquarters to the United States. Supporters {{argue that the}} U.S. has the highest combined statutory corporate income tax rate among OECD countries along with being the only country with no border adjustment element in its tax system. Proponents state that because the FairTax eliminates corporate income taxes and is automatically border adjustable, the competitive tax advantage of foreign producers would be eliminated, immediately boosting U.S. competitiveness overseas and at home.|$|E
5|$|In 1834, Waller went to New York City to be a tutor, {{but left}} after {{three or four}} weeks. This {{was the last time}} in his life that he was paid as a teacher but he still opened and funded some schools. He opened a {{classical}} school in Bloomsburg, which was built in 1839, and he contributed $3500 to it. Shortly after arriving in Bloomsburg, he organized a singing school and also created a Bible class in 1839. The class continued until after his death. He helped to open Bloomsburg's State Normal School. He was appointed a trustee of Lafayette College in 1849 by the Synod of Philadelphia. He held that position until 1879. He was also on Lafayette College's Ways and <b>Means</b> <b>committee</b> and helped stop the college from closing in 1852. In 1856, Waller helped convert a classical school into the Bloomsburg Literary Institute and served as one of the nine initial trustees. He resigned from being a trustee in 1866 after a dispute about where to set up a new building for the institute. Despite resigning from the trustees, he helped conduct the opening ceremony of the institute's new building on April 3, 1867.|$|E

5|$|In 1886, a bill {{to reduce}} the tariff was {{narrowly}} defeated in the House. The tariff issue was emphasized in the Congressional elections that year, and the forces of protectionism increased their numbers in the Congress, but Cleveland continued to advocate tariff reform. As the surplus grew, Cleveland and the reformers called for a tariff for revenue only. His message to Congress in 1887 (quoted at right) highlighted the injustice of taking more money from the people than the government needed to pay its operating expenses. Republicans, as well as protectionist northern Democrats like Samuel J. Randall, believed that American industries would fail without high tariffs, and they continued to fight reform efforts. Roger Q. Mills, chairman of the House Ways and <b>Means</b> <b>Committee,</b> proposed {{a bill to}} reduce the tariff from about 47% to about 40%. After significant exertions by Cleveland and his allies, the bill passed the House. The Republican Senate failed to come to agreement with the Democratic House, and the bill died in the conference committee. Dispute over the tariff persisted into the 1888 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|When Randall {{returned}} to Washington in 1881 {{to begin his}} term in the 47th Congress, the legislature was controlled by Republicans. After Garfield's assassination later that year, Vice President Chester A. Arthur assumed the presidency. Arthur, like most Republicans, favored high tariffs, but he sought to simplify the tariff structure and to reduce excise taxes. Randall, who had {{returned to}} his seat on the Appropriations Committee, favored the president's plan, and was among the few Democrats in the House to support the it. The bill {{that emerged from the}} Ways and <b>Means</b> <b>Committee,</b> dominated by protectionists, provided for only a 10 percent reduction. After conference with the Senate, the resulting bill had an even smaller effect, reducing tariffs by an average of 1.47 percent. It passed both houses narrowly on March3, 1883, the last full day of the 47th Congress; Arthur signed the measure into law. Toward the end, Randall took less part in the debate, feeling the tension between his supporters in the House, who wanted more reductions, and his constituents at home, who wanted less.|$|E
5|$|At the 1848 Whig National Convention, Taylor {{defeated}} Henry Clay and Winfield Scott {{to receive}} the Whig nomination for President. For his Vice Presidential nominee the convention chose Millard Fillmore, a prominent New York Whig who had chaired the House Ways and <b>Means</b> <b>Committee</b> and had been a contender for Clay's Vice Presidential nominee in the 1844 election. Fillmore's selection was largely an attempt at reconciliation with northern Whigs, who were furious at the nomination of a slaveowning southerner; all factions of the party were dissatisfied with the final ticket. Taylor continued to minimize {{his role in the}} campaign, preferring not to directly meet with voters or correspond regarding his political views. His campaign was skillfully directed by Senator John J. Crittenden of Kentucky, a friend and early political supporter, and bolstered by a late endorsement from Senator Daniel Webster of Massachusetts. Taylor defeated Lewis Cass, the Democratic candidate, and Martin Van Buren, the Free Soil candidate, taking 163 of the 290 electoral votes. In the popular vote, he took 47.3%, while Cass won 42.5% and Van Buren won 10.1%. Taylor would be the last Whig to be elected president and the last person elected to the U.S. presidency from neither the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, as well as the last Southerner to win a presidential election until Woodrow Wilson's election in 1912.|$|E
