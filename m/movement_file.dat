40|$|Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) {{characterized}} by nodes with relatively high Mobility and various distributed environments represent a remarkable challenge dissimilar to MANETs. Applications of inter-vehicle and vehicle-toroadside wireless communication that {{make use of}} VANETs require reliable communication that provides a guarantee of real-time message propagation. In this thesis the performance of wireless VANET is evaluated by finding the impact of placement of Road Side Units on different Mobility Models by taking various parameters into consideration. For evaluation we use the network simulator NS- 2 with a car traffic <b>movement</b> <b>file</b> of different scenarios generated by Mobility generator Vanet MobiSim, simulating the current WLAN hardware with the Ad hoc On Demand Distance Vector routing protocol (AODV). The connectivity tests have shown {{that it is a}} realistic option to use ad hoc networks for vehicular communication. But our simulations also have drawn out that placement of Road Side Units according to the type of Mobility Model used will lead to better communication...|$|E

40|$|While Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks are {{generally}} studied using a randomized node movement model {{such as the}} Random Way-Point model [8], Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks deal with street-bound vehicles following a completely different movement pattern.

Thus, researchers need a) suitable movement patterns for simulation, and b) a solid statistical understanding of the connectivity situation independent of the protocols utilized.

40|$|During {{the period}} of the late 1920 s through the late 1940 s, a most {{remarkable}} event in the history of American social work emerged: the development of a vital radical trade union organizing effort known as the 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 rank and <b>file</b> <b>movement.</b> 2 ̆ 2 Born within the growing economic crisis of the 1920 s and maturing in the national economic collapse and social upheaval heralded by the Great Depression, the rank and <b>file</b> <b>movement</b> would attract the support and membership of thousands of professional social workers and uncredentialed relief workers in efforts to organize social service workers along the lines of industrial unionism. Within its relatively short life span, the rank and <b>file</b> <b>movement</b> would grow in sufficient number and influence to challenge both the prevailing definitions of social work as a profession - its form and identity and the essence of its function - its practice. It is the thesis of this study that an understanding of the rank and <b>file</b> <b>movement</b> is central to a modem understanding of our profession. The origin, development and demise of the rank and <b>file</b> <b>movement</b> reflects more than the historical curiosity of a momentary tendency in the evolution of a profession; rather, it reveals the enduring legacy of individuals, organizations and collective intellectual discourse in common struggle for the possibilities of a more just and democratic social order. And, perhaps unlike any other profession, the domain of social work is historically one uniquely born of this struggle, encompassing the self-imposed imperatives and paradoxes of morality, socially purposive service and scientific rationality. Consequently, this study seeks to inform the terms of this enduring legacy within the dynamic world of social work. It does so by: 1) locating the history of the rank and <b>file</b> <b>movement</b> within the context of an evolving profession; 2) analyzing this specific history of a profession within the context of broader social and political forces that defined both the limits and potentials of that evolution; and 3) assessing the implications of this history for social work in terms of its past, present and future...|$|R

40|$|Contemporary Marxists {{justify their}} {{continuing}} advocacy of independent rank and <b>file</b> <b>movements</b> in trade unions by over-optimistic readings of history. The past, {{it is commonly}} concluded, reveals a prefigurative model which suitably finessed can {{serve as the basis}} for future endeavour. Historical excavation raises doubts about this approach and discloses that the concept of a revolutionary rank and <b>file</b> <b>movement,</b> and how it should operate in practice, are problematic. The rationale for these movements rests on the unverified assertion of a fundamental structural antagonism between the trade union bureaucracy and an artificially homogenized membership. There were significant differences between the philosophy, politics and organisation of the Shop Stewards’ Movement of the Great War, the National Minority Movement of the 1920 s and subsequent rank and file initiatives from the 1930 s to the 1970 s. Taken together, they do not constitute a unified composite, still less a blueprint for any future movement. Each was flawed, particularly by adaptation to trade unionism and Russian policy. All were less successful than is sometimes assumed. Members’ dissatisfaction and periodic rebellion were recurring features of British trade unionism. However, support for rank and <b>file</b> <b>movements</b> was sporadic, uneven and temporary. Sustained organisation was typically motivated, moulded and controlled by the Communist Party. Its hegemony was far from benign and remained at some distance from Marxist ideas of revolutionary practice. The lessons are often negative.
