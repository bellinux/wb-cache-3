40|$|The FOM Fusion FEM project {{involves}} {{the construction and}} operation of a 1 -MW, 100 ms pulse, rapid tunable FEM in the 130 - 250 GHz range for fusion applications. The undulator of the FEM consists of two sections with different strengths and different lengths separated by a gap without undulator field. The design provides arbitrary focussing. Single frequency codes predict a much higher output power for the two-section undulator than for a one-section undulator. However, the different undulator strengths lead to different resonance conditions and therefore, in principle, multiple frequencies can be generated. This problem of multi-frequency generation due to the two-section undulator is under investigation. First results are presented in this paper. The longitudinal mode structure of the FEM is simulated in a multi-pass, <b>multi-frequency</b> <b>code.</b> In this code the electrons are described fully 3 D, non-wiggler averaged {{and in the long}} pulse limit. AC longitudinal space-charge forces are included. The radiation field is considered to have the known transverse radial dependence of a HE 11 -mode, due to the rectangular corrugated waveguide of the FEM. A multi-pass calculation in the single-frequency limit is presented, where the field grows into saturation...|$|E
40|$|The FOM Fusion FEM project {{involves}} {{the construction and}} operation of a 1 -MW, 100 ms pulse, rapidly tunable FEM in the 130 – 250 GHz range for fusion applications. The undulator is a novel step-tapered undulator, consisting of two sections with different strengths and lengths and equal periodicities, and separated by a fieldfree gap. The purpose of this novel proposal is to enhance the efficiency at high output power. The associated high gain in the linear and in the non-linear regime provide a unique oscillator. The spectral dynamics of the high-current FEM with a low-quality cavity is calculated with a multi-pass, <b>multi-frequency</b> <b>code.</b> In this code the electrons are described 3 D. The equations in the model are not averaged over a wiggler period. The continuous beam limit is considered. The radiation field {{is described as a}} sum over discrete frequencies. The millimeter wave field has the transverse radial dependence of the HE 11 -mode in the rectangular corrugated waveguide. The linear gain curve of the step-tapered undulator has a completely different spectrum than the single undulator. Furthermore the gain of the FEM is so high that non-linear interaction already occurs within a few passes. In the fully non-linear regime the gain is still relatively high and the output power reaches the required high level. Already in an early phase the spectral dynamics is strongly influenced by non-linear competition between the various maser modes. This non-linear mode competition is investigated, in particular the evolution of the sidebands is analized. It is observed that the spectral signal at the resonant frequency of the second undulator is suppressed. This suppression is observed for several gap lengths. Furthermore the spectrum can change with the variation of the gap length from quasi-stable to chaotic...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: To {{improve the}} axial {{resolution}} of ultrasonic elastography, {{by taking the}} advantage of code excitation and frequency compounding, <b>multi-frequency</b> with <b>coded</b> excitation for elastography (FCCE) was proposed. FCCE adopts the Chirp signal excitation scheme and strikes a balance {{in the selection of}} sub-signal bandwidth, the bandwidth overlap and the number of sub-strain image based on theoretical derivation, so as to further improve the axial resolution of elastic image. On MATLAB, <b>multi-frequency</b> with <b>coded</b> excitation for elastography was implemented and compared with short pulse. Experiments have proved that, compared with the short pulse, the elastographic signal-to-noise ratio (SNRe) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNRe) were improved significantly. Moreover, probing depth, axial resolution and target detection were improved too. Therefore, the FCCE technology can effectively improve the elastography quality and can be applied to ultrasonic clinical trials. Copyright © 2014 IFSA Publishing, S. L...|$|R

The power that gyrotrons can radiate in the millimeter- and submillimeter-wavelength regions exceeds {{the power of}} classical microwave tubes by many orders of magnitude. In this work, the author considers some problems related to the operation of gyro-devices and methods of their solution. In particular, the self-excitation conditions for parasitic backward waves and effect of distributed losses on the small-signal gain of gyro-TWTs are analyzed. The corresponding small-signal theory describing two-stage gyro-traveling-wave tubes (gyro-TWTs) with the first stage having distributed losses is presented. The theory is illustrated by using it for the description of operation of a Ka-band gyro-TWT designed at the Naval Research Laboratory. Also, the results of nonlinear studies of this tube are presented and compared with the ones obtained {{by the use of}} MAGY, a <b>multi-frequency,</b> self-consistent <b>code</b> developed at the University of Maryland.

40|$|The light {{curve and}} other {{observable}} diagnostics are presented for {{what should be}} a typical Type II 'plateau' supernova, the explosion of a 15 solar mass red supergiant. The calculations are carried out using a <b>multi-frequency</b> radiation transport <b>code</b> that includes opacity from all important mechanisms-bound-bound, bound-free, free-free, and electron scattering. It is found that the inclusion of opacity sources besides electron scattering increases the computed lenght of the plateau in the 15 solar mass model by approximately 30 days. Especially important is the ultraviolet cutoff caused by a thick forest of lines. Deposition and escape of gamma-rays from radioactive decay are also accurately simulated. We find {{that the presence of}} 0. 06 solar mass of ejected Ni- 56 extends the length of the plateau from approximately 100 days to approximately 140 dys. Because of the large hydrogen envleope and radius in this model, mixing does not appreciably alter the bolometric light curve, although it does change the gamma-ray light curve significantly. With 0. 06 solar mass of ejected Ni- 56, the unmixed (mixed) model peaks in escaping gamma-rays at 576 (466) days with gamma-ray luminosity of 3 x 10 (exp 38) ergs/s. Except for the local group, the gamma-rays from an extragalactic 15 solar mass SNe IIp will be too faint to detect with any exsiting detectors. However, a Galactic SNe IIp would be quite bright and easily detectable...|$|R

A comparative small-signal analysis of conventional four-cavity and three-stage clustered-cavity gyroklystrons is performed. The corresponding point-gap models for these devices are presented. The efficiency, gain, bandwidth and gain-bandwidth product are analyzed for each scheme. Advantages of the clustered-cavity over the conventional design are discussed. The startup scenarios in high-power gyrotrons and the most important physical effects associated with them are considered. The work presents the results of startup simulations for a 140 GHz, MW-class gyrotron developed by Communications and Power Industries (CPI) for electron-cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) and current drive experiments on the "Wendelstein 7 -X" stellarator plasma. Also presented are the results for a 110 GHz, 1. 5 MW gyrotron currently being developed at CPI. The simulations are carried out for six competing modes and with the effects of electron velocity spread and voltage depression taken into account. Also, the slow stage of the startup in long-pulse gyrotrons is analyzed and attention is paid to the effects of ion compensation of the beam space charge, frequency deviation due to the cavity wall heating and beam current decrease due to cathode cooling. These effects are modeled with a simple nonlinear theory and the code MAGY...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{considers the}} optimization of radar performance within the structure imposed by a coded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) format {{required to achieve}} an acceptable communication link. The dual goal of achieving both satisfactory radar and communication performance raises challenges that can be substantively addressed by combining phase coding and modulation techniques to provide the temporal and spectral structure necessary to implement simultaneous radar and communication operations. In particular, the specific techniques, as introduced within this dissertation, of using the <b>Multi-Frequency</b> Complementary Phase <b>Coded</b> (MCPC) sequences, as prescribed by Levanon and Mozeson, for simultaneous radar and wireless communication operations represent a novel contribution and offers a significant improvement in the study, implementation, and performance of dual use radar and communication waveforms and signal processing techniques. Specific contributions of this dissertation include: 1) as will be demonstrated, not all valid MCPC sequences {{can be used for}} data transmission, and, therefore, a subset of MCPC sequences are chosen with consideration to radar detection performance, 2) communication operation is improved through the introduction of an algorithm that enables Gray codes to be applied to MCPC sequences, 3) the orthogonality of MCPC sequences is exploited to overcome the effects of multipath fading and intercarrier interference, 4) a new detector type, termed the Beta detector, is developed for both communications operations and radar detection, 5) a radar detection method, termed Polar Signal Detection, is developed that combines the Beta detector with a traditional matched filter detector to achieve superior detection performance as compared to traditional Cell-Averaging Constant False Alarm Rate (CA-CFAR) detectors in multi-target environments, and 6) a novel method of measuring Doppler frequencies is introduced that is superior to the measurement performance of traditional radar systems...|$|R
40|$|The first {{generation}} of stars that formed directly from the primordial gas {{played a crucial role}} in the early phase of the reionization of the universe. Because of the short lifetimes of these stars the metals produced in their cores were quickly returned to the environment, from which early PopII stars with a different initial mass function and different SEDs were formed, already much earlier than the time at which the universe became completely reionized at a redshift of z~ 6. Using a state-of-the-art model atmosphere code we calculate realistic SEDs of very massive stars (VMSs) of different metallicities to serve as input for the 3 -dimensional <b>multi-frequency</b> radiative transfer <b>code</b> we have developed to simulate the temporal evolution of the ionization of the inhomogeneous interstellar and intergalactic medium, using multiple stellar clusters as sources of ionizing radiation. Our tool handles distributions of numerous radiative sources characterized by high resolution synthetic SEDs, and yields occupation numbers of the required energy levels of the most important elements which are treated in NLTE consistently with the 3 d radiative transfer. We further demonstrate that the increasing metallicity of the radiative sources in the transition from PopIII stars to PopII stars has a strong impact on the hardness of the emitted spectrum, and hence on the reionization history of helium. A top-heavy stellar mass distribution characterized by VMSs forming in chemically evolved clusters of high core mass density may not only provide the progenitors of intermediate-mass and supermassive black holes (SMBHs), but also play an important role for the reionization of HeII. The number of VMSs required to reionize HeII by a redshift of z~ 2. 5 is astonishingly close to the number of VMSs required to explain galactic SMBHs if one assumes that these have been formed by mergers of smaller black holes.
