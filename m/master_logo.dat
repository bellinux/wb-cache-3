5000|$|In 2011, Payne and {{his fellow}} members at Augusta National {{continued}} further with diverting from the club's usually uncompromising, tradition-laden ways by establishing another contemporary modification to their featured golf tournament. They have now sanctioned a video game that features the <b>Masters</b> name, <b>logo,</b> and their fabled golf course. The video game is so technologically sophisticated that if rain - for example - should happen to be falling in Augusta, Ga. on the day an end-user powers up the game from anywhere around the world, rain will also be simulated on the end-user's video screen.|$|R
5000|$|The {{parent company}} of Lyric Records was {{initially}} listed on the label as the Lyraphone Company of America, New York City, although actually headquartered in Newark, New Jersey. Later labels reflected the actual location. The label artwork featured a drawing of a white cat (perhaps inspired by the dog Nipper of the Victor Talking Machine Company's His <b>Master's</b> Voice <b>logo)</b> seated on a gramophone record, with the legend [...] "Never Scratches". Lyric Records actually seem to be exactly as prone to scratching as any other shellac 78rpm record of the era.|$|R
5000|$|The Masters {{brand name}} was {{announced}} on 2 May 2011, {{coinciding with the}} launch of a website at masters.com.au.

40|$|In Plutarch's {{dialogue}} De genio Socratis, Garaxidoros, who is {{a typical}} Greek citizen, argues a question of Socrates' obedience to divine sign. The problem is that Socrates is the <b>master</b> of reason (<b>logos),</b> whereas his entire life has been organized by irrational means, especially divine sign (daimonion). My papers are intended as historical considerations of this problem. In this part, I refer to Aristophanes' comedy and Plato's dialogues. We meet a paradoxical philosopher in them...|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Blue Peter" [...] shows Oldfield {{competing}} {{in a race}} with various kinds of vehicles. The intro is filmed {{in black and white}} and begins with a silent film style title card 'Episode 4 [...] "The Race"'; there is a second card after a short sequence with Oldfield and another man, displaying 'Zhree, Two, vun Actshun!' (meaning 'Three, Two, One, Action!'). The race then begins, three of the competitors are Oldfield himself (filmed in different shots as a pilot, pirate and a man with a moustache) and some are not. The vehicles include hovercraft, a tricycle hang glider, a helicopter, a three-wheeled ATV, a larger ATV and a kite buggy. The end of the video appears to parody the His <b>Master's</b> Voice <b>logo</b> with a gramophone and a dog (i.e. Nipper).|$|R

50|$|In 1957, RCA {{ended its}} 55-year {{association}} with EMI/HMV {{and signed a}} distribution deal with Decca Records, which caused EMI to purchase Capitol Records. Capitol then became the main distributor for EMI recordings in North and South America, with RCA distributing its recordings through Decca in the United Kingdom on the RCA label. RCA used the lightning bolt logo instead of the His <b>Master's</b> Voice Nipper <b>logo</b> (now owned by HMV in the UK as EMI transferred trademark ownership in 2003) in the UK. RCA set up its own British distribution in 1969.|$|R
5000|$|JVC is {{generally}} known within Japan by the Victor brand, preceded by the His <b>Master's</b> Voice (HMV) <b>logo</b> featuring the dog Nipper. Because {{of a conflict}} in trademarks between HMV and Victor, HMV {{is not allowed to}} use Nipper in Japan. At one time, the company used the Nivico name (for [...] "Nippon Victor Company") overseas, before rebranding to JVC, which stands for Japan's Victor Company. Therefore, the Victor and JVC-Victor web sites look quite different. Conversely, the HMV store chain exists in Japan (though no longer owned by HMV Group), but it cannot use the His Master's Voice motto or logo; its logo is a stylized image of a gramophone only.|$|R
40|$|I am {{concerned}} with the problem that Socrates is the <b>master</b> of reason (<b>logos),</b> whereas his entire life has been organized by irrational means, namely the divine sign (daimonion). The aim {{of this paper is}} to consider Socrates' Daimonion about which Xenophon tells us, especially compared with that Plato draws. Xenophon's reports have much in common with those of Plato. He, for example, puts Daimonion in another way as traditional God, and is making it connected with the art of prediction. However, their views differ as to the contents of prediction which Daimonion passes. In Plato's dialogues, Daimonion tells Socrates only about a command of prohibition to the act which he will be trying to perform. There, the selection of the act by Socrates' own reason has already existed. In Xenophon's dialogues, on the other hard, Daimonion seems to order Socrates positively to perform such a specific act as what he must to do. There is no room for Socrates' reason to be involved. According to Xenophon, Daimonion and reason would not be compatible in the case of a moral act. In this case, does Socrates' reason lose the place to commit completely? Xenophon distinguishes between the matter with which man is concerned, and the matter unclear to man. Then he assigns reason to the former and Daimonion to the latter. Knowledge about a moral act belongs to a realm beyond man's capability...|$|R
