5|$|In China, {{silk-worm}} farming {{was originally}} restricted to women, and many women {{were employed in}} the silk-making industry.

For approximately a millennium, the right to wear silk was reserved for the emperor and the highest dignitaries. Silk was, at the time, a sign of great wealth, because of its shimmering appearance. This appearance was due to silk's prism-like shape/structure, which refracted light from every angle. After some time, silk gradually extended to other classes of Chinese society. Silk began to be used for decorative <b>means</b> <b>and</b> also in less luxurious ways: musical instruments, fishing, and bow making.
