5|$|Burnet's major {{achievements}} in microbiology included discovering the causative agents of Q-fever and psittacosis; developing assays for the isolation, culture and detection of influenza virus; describing the recombination of influenza strains; demonstrating that the <b>myxomatosis</b> virus {{does not cause}} disease in humans. Modern methods for producing influenza vaccines are still based on Burnet's work improving virus growing processes in hen's eggs.|$|E
5|$|The island's rabbit population, {{introduced}} {{for farming}} in the 12th century, suffers from <b>myxomatosis,</b> which effectively contains the numbers. The island has been grazed since 1989, initially by goats, {{but also by}} sheep since 1992. In 1997 Soay sheep were introduced and as of 2008 there are 28 sheep grazing wild on the island.|$|E
5|$|Fleas are vectors for viral, {{bacterial}} and rickettsial {{diseases of}} humans and other animals, {{as well as of}} protozoan and helminth parasites. Bacterial diseases carried by fleas include murine or endemic typhus. and bubonic plague. Fleas can transmit Rickettsia typhi, Rickettsia felis, and Bartonella henselae, and the <b>myxomatosis</b> virus. They can carry Hymenolepiasis tapeworms and Trypanosome protozoans. The chigoe flea or jigger (Tunga penetrans) causes the disease tungiasis, a major public health problem around the world. Fleas that specialize as parasites on specific mammals may use other mammals as hosts; thus, humans may be bitten by cat and dog fleas.|$|E
5|$|Lundy {{is home to}} {{an unusual}} range of mammals, almost all introduced, {{including}} a distinct breed of wild pony, the Lundy pony. Until recently, Lundy and the Shiant Isles in the Hebrides {{were the only two}} places in the UK where the black rat (Rattus rattus) could be found regularly. In the rest of the United Kingdom they have largely been replaced by brown rats except for occasional sightings in port towns and the Thames Estuary. It has since been eradicated on the island, {{in order to protect the}} nesting seabirds. Other species which have made the island their home include the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus), Sika deer (Cervus nippon), pygmy shrew (Sorex minutus) and feral goats (Capra aegagrus hircus). Unusually, 20% of the rabbits (Leporidae) on the island are melanistic compared with 4% which is typical in the UK. In mid-2006 the rabbit population was devastated by <b>myxomatosis,</b> leaving only 60 pairs from the previous 15–20,000 individuals. Soay sheep (Ovis aries) on the island have been shown to vary their behaviours according to nutritional requirements, the distribution of food and the risk of predation.|$|E
25|$|The rabbit {{population}} reached {{eight to}} ten thousand individuals {{before the arrival of}} <b>myxomatosis</b> in 1954 killed all but 12 animals, although numbers increased afterwards. Further outbreaks of the disease have led to fluctuating numbers of rabbits on the island. Other resident mammals include stoats, common shrews, pygmy shrews, wood mice and short-tailed voles. Three species of deer have travelled over the marshes to reach the island.|$|E
25|$|The {{continued}} {{rain and}} mild conditions (warm in the south, {{cool in the}} tropics) led to an outbreak of Murray Valley encephalitis which killed 19 people during the subsequent summer. It had the remarkable positive, however, of allowing the first curbs to the rabbit plague in Australia via <b>myxomatosis,</b> which had not spread in the dry era since 1922 because {{of the absence of}} standing water for mosquitoes to breed.|$|E
25|$|The rabbits rapidly multiplied before {{numbers were}} reduced to about 10,000 in the early 1980s when <b>myxomatosis</b> was introduced. Rabbit numbers then grew again to over 100,000 by 2006. The rodents feed on young chicks while rabbits {{nibbling}} on the grass layer has led to soil erosion and cliff collapses, destroying seabird nests. Large portions of the Macquarie Island bluffs are eroding as a result. In September 2006 a large landslip at Lusitania Bay, {{on the eastern side}} of the island, partially destroyed an important penguin breeding colony. Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service attributed the landslip to a combination of heavy spring rains and severe erosion caused by rabbits.|$|E
25|$|The European rabbit or common rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is {{a species}} of rabbit native to southwestern Europe (Spain, Portugal and Western France) and {{northwest}} Africa (Morocco and Algeria). It has been widely introduced elsewhere, often with devastating effects on local biodiversity. However, its decline in its native range (caused by the diseases <b>myxomatosis</b> and rabbit calicivirus, as well as overhunting and habitat loss), has caused the decline of its highly dependent predators, the Iberian lynx and the Spanish imperial eagle. It is known as an invasive species {{because it has been}} introduced to countries on all continents with the exception of Antarctica, and caused many problems within the environment and ecosystems. Australia has the most problems with European rabbits, {{due to the lack of}} natural predators there.|$|E
500|$|Under Burnet's direction, {{scientists}} at the Institute {{made significant contributions to}} infectious disease research during a period that has been called the [...] "golden age of virology". Virologists including Alick Isaacs, Gordon Ada, John Cairns, Stephen Fazekas de St. Groth, and Frank Fenner made significant contributions on Murray Valley encephalitis, <b>myxomatosis,</b> poliomyelitis, poxviruses, herpes and influenza.|$|E
500|$|The rabbit {{population}} {{can grow}} {{to a level}} at which their grazing and burrowing adversely affects the fragile dune vegetation. When rabbit numbers are reduced by <b>myxomatosis,</b> the plants recover, although those that are toxic to rabbits, like ragwort, then become less common due to increased competition from the edible species. The rabbits may be killed by carnivores such as red foxes, weasels and stoats. Records of [...] mammals that are rare in the NNR area include red deer swimming in the haven, a hedgehog and a beached Sowerby's beaked whale.|$|E
500|$|Craigleith lies {{close to}} North Berwick's harbour and {{historically}} {{was used as}} a rabbit warren. The rabbits were bred for food but they were wiped out by <b>myxomatosis</b> in the 1950s. The Atlantic puffin colony on Craigleith, once {{one of the largest in}} Britain with 28,000 pairs, became endangered from 1999 onwards, due to an invasion of the non-endemic plant tree mallow, which choked the puffins' burrows, preventing them from rearing their chicks, or [...] "pufflings". A five-year project, SOS Puffin, led by the Scottish Seabird Centre at North Berwick, was launched early in 2007. Since then, hundreds of volunteers have been working hard to rid the island of the problem, ferried out by boat from the Seabird Centre during the winter months, when the puffins are at sea. There are signs that the puffins are starting to return to the island to breed. Fidra, Inchmickery and Eyebroughy are RSPB reserves, the last being noted for its cormorants. Over 240 species of bird and 60 varieties of seaweed have been recorded on the Isle of May.|$|E
2500|$|Twenty-four European rabbits were {{introduced}} to Australia in 1859 by estate owner Thomas Austin in Victoria. They soon spread throughout the country {{due to the lack}} of natural predators, widespread farming producing an ideal habitat, and mild Australian winters allowing them to breed year-round. Australia's equivalent to the rabbit, the bilby, was quickly pushed out by the rabbits. The bilbies are endangered, but are now making a comeback due to government protection. Between 1901 and 1907, Australia built an immense [...] "rabbit-proof fence" [...] to halt the westward expansion of the introduced rabbit population. The European rabbit can not only jump very high, but also burrow underground, making fencing essentially futile. During the 1950s, experiments with introduction of a virus, <b>Myxomatosis</b> cuniiculi, provided some relief in Australia, but not in New Zealand, where the insect vectors necessary for spread of the disease were not present. <b>Myxomatosis</b> can also infect pet rabbits of the same species. Today's remaining wild rabbits in Australia are largely immune to <b>myxomatosis.</b> The rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus has been cleared as a biological control agent against the European rabbit in Australia, and has already killed millions of the animals. It was also illegally introduced in New Zealand.|$|E
2500|$|The European rabbit is {{well known}} for digging {{networks}} of burrows, called warrens, where it spends most of its time when not feeding. Unlike the related hares (Lepus spp.), rabbits are altricial, the young being born blind and furless, in a fur-lined nest in the warren, and they are totally dependent upon their mother. Much of the modern research into wild rabbit behaviour was carried out in the 1960s by two research centres. One was the naturalist Ronald Lockley, who maintained a number of large enclosures for wild rabbit colonies, with observation facilities, in Orielton, Pembrokeshire. Apart from publishing a number of scientific papers, he popularised his findings in a book The Private Life of the Rabbit, which is credited by Richard Adams as having {{played a key role in}} his gaining [...] "a knowledge of rabbits and their ways" [...] that informed his novel Watership Down. The other group was the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia, where numerous studies of the social behavior of wild rabbits were performed. Since the onset of <b>myxomatosis,</b> and the decline of the significance of the rabbit as an agricultural pest, few large-scale studies have been performed and many aspects of rabbit behaviour are still poorly understood.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with the}} least weasel, mouse-like rodents predominate in the stoat's diet. However, unlike the least weasel, which almost {{exclusively}} feeds on small voles, the stoat regularly preys on larger rodent and lagomorph species, and will take down individuals far larger than itself. In Russia, its prey includes rodents and lagomorphs such as European water voles, common hamsters, pikas, and others, which it overpowers in their burrows. Prey species of secondary importance include small birds, fish, and shrews and, more rarely, amphibians, lizards, and insects. In Great Britain, European rabbits are an important food source, with the frequency in which stoats prey on them having increased between the 1960s and mid 1990s {{since the end of}} the <b>myxomatosis</b> epidemic. Typically, male stoats prey on rabbits more frequently than females do, which depend to a greater extent on smaller rodent species. British stoats rarely kill shrews, rats, squirrels and water voles, though rats may be an important food source locally. In Ireland, shrews and rats are frequently eaten. In mainland Europe, water voles make up a large portion of the stoat's diet. Hares are sometimes taken, but are usually young specimens. In North America, where the ecological niche for rat and rabbit sized prey is taken by the larger long-tailed weasel, the stoat preys on mice, voles, shrews, and young cottontails. In New Zealand, the stoat feeds principally on birds, including the rare kiwi, kaka, mohua, yellow-crowned parakeet, and New Zealand dotterel. Cases are known of stoats preying on young muskrats. The stoat typically eats about [...] of food a day, which is equivalent to 25% of the animal's live weight.|$|E
50|$|<b>Myxomatosis</b> is {{a threat}} to the health of pet and {{livestock}} rabbits. Rabbits caged outdoors in Australia are vulnerable in areas with high numbers of mosquitoes. In Europe, fleas are the carriers of <b>myxomatosis.</b> In some countries, annual vaccinations against <b>myxomatosis</b> are available. In Australia, <b>myxomatosis</b> was intentionally introduced into the feral population of European rabbits (which have become an invasive species) as a means of population control. The Australian government will not allow veterinarians to purchase and use the vaccine that would protect domestic rabbits, for fear that this immunity would be spread into the wild by escaped livestock and pets. This is also the motivation for the pet-rabbit ban in Queensland.|$|E
50|$|There is {{evidence}} it carries <b>myxomatosis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In most jurisdictions, {{including}} the United States (except were required by local animal control ordinances), rabbits {{do not require}} vaccination. Vaccinations exist for both rabbit hemorrhagic disease and <b>myxomatosis.</b> These vaccinations are usually given annually, two weeks apart. If there is an outbreak of <b>myxomatosis</b> locally, this vaccine can be administered every six months for extra protection. [...] <b>Myxomatosis</b> immunizations are not available in all countries, including Australia, due to fears that immunity will pass on to feral rabbits. However, they are recommended by some veterinarians as prophylactics, where they are legally available.|$|E
50|$|A legal vaccine {{exists in}} Australia for RHD. There {{is no cure}} for either <b>myxomatosis</b> or RHD, and many {{affected}} pets are euthanised. In Europe, where rabbits are farmed on a large scale, they are protected against <b>myxomatosis</b> and calicivirus with a genetically modified virus. The vaccine was developed in Spain.|$|E
