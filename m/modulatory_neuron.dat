2500|$|The {{experiment}} of Kemenes et al. {{demonstrated that}} in an extrinsic <b>modulatory</b> <b>neuron,</b> nonsynaptic plasticity influences the expression of long-term associative memory. The relationship between nonsynaptic plasticity and memory was assessed using cerebral giant cells (CGCs). Depolarization from conditioned stimuli increased the neuronal network response. This depolarization lasted {{as long as the}} long-term memory. Persistent depolarization and behavioral memory expression occurred more than 24 hours after training, indicating long-term effects. In this experiment, the electrophysiological expression of the long-term memory trace was a conditioned stimulus induced feeding response. CGCs were significantly more depolarized in the trained organisms than the control group, indicating association with learning and excitability changes. When CGCs were depolarized, they showed an increased response to the conditional stimuli and a stronger fictive feeding response. This demonstrated that the depolarization is enough to produce a significant feeding response to the conditioned stimuli. [...] Additionally, no significant difference was observed in the feeding rates between conditioned organisms and ones that were artificially depolarized, reaffirming that depolarization is sufficient to generate the behavior associated with long-term memory.|$|E
40|$|A {{constant}} facilitation {{of responses}} evoked in the earthworm muscle contraction generator neurons by responses evoked in the neurons of its {{peripheral nervous system}} was demonstrated. It {{is based on the}} proposal that these two responses are bifurcations of an afferent response evoked by the same peripheral mechanical stimulus but converging again on this central neuron. A single-peaked generator response without facilitation was demonstrated by sectioning the afferent route of the peripheral facilitatory modulatory response, or conditioning response (CR). The multipeaked response could be restored by restimulating the sectioned <b>modulatory</b> <b>neuron</b> with an intracellular substitutive conditioning stimulus (SCS).

However, we show here that a persistent depolarization of membrane potential, a type of cellular change that increases neuronal responsiveness, contributes significantly to a long-lasting associative memory trace. The use of a model invertebrate network with identified neurons and known synaptic connectivity had the advantage that the contribution of this cellular change to memory could be evaluated in a neuron with a known function in the learning circuit. Specifically, we used the well-understood motor circuit underlying molluscan feeding [2 - 4] and showed that a key <b>modulatory</b> <b>neuron</b> involved in the initiation of feeding ingestive movements [5] underwent a long-term depolarization following behavioral associative conditioning [6]. This depolarization led to an enhanced single cell and network responsiveness to a previously neutral tactile conditioned stimulus, and the persistence of both matched {{the time course of}} behavioral associative memory.

Here, using behavioral, electrophysiological, and optical recording methods, we show that the previously described learning-induced depolarization of a <b>modulatory</b> <b>neuron</b> [5] of the Lymnaea feeding system affects its axonal terminals in a spatially segregated manner. In a side branch of the axon of the cerebral giant cells (CGCs), classical conditioning of intact animals reduced proximal-to-distal attenuation of spike-evoked calcium transients, providing a highly effective mechanism for a compartmentalized increase in synaptic efficacy. Somatic depolarization by current injection, which spreads onto the CGC's axonal side branch [5], and the blocking of A-type potassium channels with 4 -aminopyridine had an effect similar to learning on the calcium transients.

What still remains unclear, though, is how nonsynaptic plasticity contributes to the altered neural network properties on which memory depends. Understanding how nonsynaptic plasticity is translated into modified network and behavioral output therefore represents an important objective of current learning and memory research. Results By using behavioral single-trial classical conditioning together with electrophysiological analysis and calcium imaging, we have explored the cellular mechanisms by which experience-induced nonsynaptic electrical changes in a neuronal soma remote from the synaptic region are translated into synaptic and circuit level effects. We show that after single-trial food-reward conditioning in the snail Lymnaea stagnalis, identified modulatory neurons that are extrinsic to the feeding network become persistently depolarized between 16 and 24 hr after training. This is delayed with respect to early memory formation but concomitant with the establishment and duration of long-term memory. The persistent nonsynaptic change is extrinsic to and maintained independently of synaptic effects occurring within the network directly responsible for the generation of feeding. Artificial membrane potential manipulation and calcium-imaging experiments suggest a novel mechanism whereby the somal depolarization of an extrinsic neuron recruits command-like intrinsic neurons of the circuit underlying the learned behavior.

Using the molluscan model system Lymnaea, we investigate here whether LTM formation is associated with specific changes in the activity of members of the NOS gene family: Lym-nNOS 1, Lym-nNOS 2, and the antisense RNA-producing pseudogene (anti-NOS). We show that expression of the Lym-nNOS 1 gene is transiently upregulated in cerebral ganglia after conditioning. The activation of the gene is precisely timed and occurs {{at the end of a}} critical period during which NO is required for memory consolidation. Moreover, we demonstrate that this induction of the Lym-nNOS 1 gene is targeted to an identified <b>modulatory</b> <b>neuron</b> called the cerebral giant cell (CGC).

40|$|SummaryRecent {{studies of}} {{behavioral}} choice {{support the notion}} that the decision to carry out one behavior rather than another depends on the reconfiguration of shared interneuronal networks [1]. We investigated another decision-making strategy, derived from the classical ethological literature [2, 3], which proposes that behavioral choice depends on competition between autonomous networks. According to this model, behavioral choice depends on inhibitory interactions between incompatible hierarchically organized behaviors. We provide evidence for this by investigating the interneuronal mechanisms mediating behavioral choice between two autonomous circuits that underlie whole-body withdrawal [4, 5] and feeding [6] in the pond snail Lymnaea. Whole-body withdrawal is a defensive reflex that is initiated by tactile contact with predators. As predicted by the hierarchical model, tactile stimuli that evoke whole-body withdrawal responses also inhibit ongoing feeding in the presence of feeding stimuli. By recording neurons from the feeding and withdrawal networks, we found no direct synaptic connections between the interneuronal and motoneuronal elements that generate the two behaviors. Instead, we discovered that behavioral choice depends on the interaction between two unique types of interneurons with asymmetrical synaptic connectivity that allows withdrawal to override feeding.

In addition, gastric mill motor activity was elicited for the duration of the stimulation.

The behavioural and neurophysiological consequences of rapid escalation of blood alcohol concentration and subsequent withdrawal, and their effects on learning and memory and underlying neural circuitry can be studied in suitable animal models. Here, spatial and instrumental learning as well as hippocampal LTP were assessed in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice for the effects of adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) and other ethanol treatments. AIE treatment did not impair spatial or non-spatial memory when tested in adulthood. However, if mice were trained whilst intoxicated during AIE treatment, spatial memory was impaired. Post-training injections of ethanol impaired performance in operant conditioning. A rapid rise and fall in ethanol concentration, prior to stimulation, blocked LTP induction in drug naïve hippocampal slices; an effect that was not seen if the ethanol concentration was gradually increased and decreased. Moreover, AIE treatment caused an NMDA receptor-dependent transient increase in hippocampal LTP. The second part of this study used a novel molluscan model Lymnaea stagnalis and demonstrated that high concentrations of ethanol blocked acquisition and retrieval of an associative memory. However, if acquisition occurred in the presence of ethanol then memory could also be retrieved under ethanol, demonstrating ethanol state dependency.

To understand the role of each co-localized substance released from an individual neuron, {{it is necessary to}} characterize the actions of these substances on their potential target neurons or muscles. The neuropil of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab Cancer borealis contains more than 15 different neuromodulators (Marder et al., 1995, 1997; Marder and Weimann, 1992). These substances are found in approximately 20 pairs of <b>modulatory</b> <b>neurons</b> (Coleman et al., 1992) that project into the STG neuropil primarily from somata in the paired commissural ganglia (CoGs) and unpaired oesophageal ganglion (OG).

The neurotransmitter g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is found in inputs to the STG in several decapod species (Blitz et al., 1999; Cazalets et al., 1987; Cournil et al., 1990 a,b; Mulloney and Hall, 1990).

40|$|Neural {{networks}} underlying rhythmic behaviors produce different motor {{patterns in}} response to different modulatory inputs, even in the isolated nervous system. This modulation of network activity has been studied in various systems by neurotransmitter bath application and stimulation of sensory and/or projection neuron inputs. However, {{little is known about}} the mechanisms whereby distinct inputs select distinct motor patterns from a single neural network. One possibility is that they use different transmitters, or transmitter complements. While many neurons contain cotransmitters, there is little information regarding the identity and roles of cotransmitters used by modulatory inputs in motor pattern selection. These issues were addressed in the stomatogastric nervous system of the crab Cancer borealis, focusing on the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) neural network. The STG is a well characterized multifunctional network that produces multiple versions of the gastric mill and pyloric rhythms. There are three projection neuron pairs, MPN, MCN 1 and MCN 7, which innervate the STG and contain the same peptide transmitter, proctolin. Dye-fills and immunocytochemistry were used to document that these projection neurons contain distinct transmitter complements. This documentation included identifying the presence and physiological actions of two tachykinin-like peptides. One of these peptides is related to the crab neuropeptide that is an MCN 1 cotransmitter. Standard electrophysiological techniques demonstrated that each proctolin neuron elicits a distinct STG motor pattern. The MCN 7 motor pattern results partly from a selective enhancement of activity in one STG network neuron. The MPN motor pattern results partly from its actions on parallel pathways originating in the commissural ganglia (CoGs). MPN stimulation inhibits the gastric mill rhythm by inhibiting these projection neurons. Previous work showed that proctolin application mimics MPN excitation of the pyloric rhythm in the STG. Pharmacological techniques and transmitter application were used here to document that MPN uses only GABA to influence the CoG projection neurons. The separate actions of the MPN cotransmitters demonstrate a functional cotransmitter segregation in an identified <b>modulatory</b> <b>neuron.</b> This work also documents the use of distinct cotransmitter complements, interactions among parallel pathways and selective alteration of network neuron function to select distinct motor patterns from a multifunctional neural network. ...|$|E

Unique amongst antennal-lobe neurons is an identified wide-field serotonergic neuron, the contralaterally-projecting, serotonin-immunoreactive deutocerebral neuron (CSDn). The CSDn spreads its termini all over the contralateral antennal lobe, suggesting a diffuse neuromodulatory role. A closer examination, however, reveals a restricted pattern of the CSDn arborization in some glomeruli. We show that sensory neuron-derived Eph interacts with Ephrin in the CSDn, to regulate these arborizations. Behavioural analysis of animals with altered Eph-ephrin signaling and with consequent arborization defects suggests that neuromodulation requires local glomerular-specific patterning of the CSDn termini. Our results show the importance of developmental regulation of terminal arborization of even the diffuse <b>modulatory</b> <b>neurons</b> {{to allow them to}} route sensory-inputs according to the behavioural contexts...|$|R
40|$|Insect {{mushroom}} {{bodies are}} required for diverse behavioral functions, including odor learning and memory. Using the numerically simple olfactory pathway of the Drosophila melanogaster larva, we provide evidence that the formation of appetitive olfactory associations relies on embryonic-born intrinsic mushroom body neurons (Kenyon cells). The participation of larval-born Kenyon cells, i. e., neurons that become gradually integrated in the developing mushroom body during larval life, in this task is unlikely. These data provide important insights into how a small set of identified Kenyon cells can store and integrate olfactory information in a developing brain. To investigate possible functional subdivisions of the larval mushroom body, we anatomically disentangle its input and output neurons at the single-cell level. Based on this approach, we define 10 subdomains of the larval mushroom body that may be implicated in mediating specific interactions between the olfactory pathway, <b>modulatory</b> <b>neurons,</b> and neuronal output...|$|R
40|$|SummaryMolecular {{analyses}} of Aplysia, a well-established model organism for cellular and systems neural science, have been seriously handicapped {{by a lack}} of adequate genomic information. By sequencing cDNA libraries from the central nervous system (CNS), we have identified over 175, 000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs), of which 19, 814 are unique neuronal gene products and represent 50 %– 70 % of the total Aplysia neuronal transcriptome. We have characterized the transcriptome at three levels: (1) the central nervous system, (2) the elementary components of a simple behavior: the gill-withdrawal reflex—by analyzing sensory, motor, and serotonergic <b>modulatory</b> <b>neurons,</b> and (3) processes of individual neurons. In addition to increasing the amount of available gene sequences of Aplysia by two orders of magnitude, this collection represents the largest database available for any member of the Lophotrochozoa and therefore provides additional insights into evolutionary strategies used by this highly successful diversified lineage, one of the three proposed superclades of bilateral animals...|$|R
40|$|Intra-axonal {{recordings}} of stomatogastric nerve axon 1 (SNAXl) {{indicate that there}} are synaptic inputs onto the SNAXI terminals in the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab Cancer borealis (Nusbaum et al., 1992 b). To de-termine whether this synaptic input only influenced SNAXI activity within the STG, we identified the SNAXI soma in the commissural ganglion (COG). We found that this neuron has a neuropilar arborization in the COG and also receives syn-aptic inputs in this ganglion. Based on its soma location, we have renamed this <b>neuron</b> <b>modulatory</b> commissural <b>neuron</b> 1 (MCNI). While intracellular stimulation of MCNI [...] ,, and MCN 1 s,wx has the same excitatory effects on the STG motor patterns, MCNI receives distinct synaptic inputs in the STG and COG. Moreover, the synaptic input that MCNI receives within the STG compartmentalizes its activity. Specifically...|$|R
40|$|In {{a number}} of {{neuronal}} models of learning signalling by endogenous nitric oxide (NO), produced by the enzyme NO synthase (NOS), {{is essential for the}} formation of long-term memory (LTM). For example, in the molluscan model system Lymnaea, NO is required for LTM formation in the first few hours after one-trial reward conditioning. Furthermore, conditioning leads to transient up-regulation of the NOS gene in identified <b>modulatory</b> <b>neurons,</b> the cerebral giant cells (CGCs), which are known to be involved in LTM formation. In Lymnaea nothing is known however about the structure and localization of the major receptor for NO, the soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). Here we report on the cloning and characterization of both ? and ? subunits of NO-sensitive sGC and show that they are coexpressed in the CGCs. Furthermore, our electrophysiological experiments on isolated CGCs show that these neurons respond to NO by generating a prolonged depolarization of the membrane potential. Moreover, we demonstrate that this depolarization is blocked by ODQ, supporting our hypothesis that it is mediated by sGC...|$|R
40|$|Specificity in {{the actions}} of {{different}} <b>modulatory</b> <b>neurons</b> is often attributed to their having distinct cotransmitter complements. We are assessing the validity of this hypothesis with the stomatogastric nervous system of the crab Cancer borealis. In this nervous system, the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) contains a multifunctional network that generates the gastric mill and pyloric rhythms. Two identified projection neurons [modulatory proctolin <b>neuron</b> (MPN) and <b>modulatory</b> commissural <b>neuron</b> 1 (MCN 1) ] that innervate the STG and modulate these rhythms contain GABA and the pentapeptide proctolin, but only MCN 1 contains Cancer borealis tachykinin-related peptide (CabTRP Ia). Selective activation of each projection neuron elicits different rhythms from the STG. MPN elicits only a pyloric rhythm, whereas MCN 1 elicits a distinct pyloric rhythm {{as well as a}} gastric mill rhythm. We tested the degree to which CabTRP Ia distinguishes {{the actions of}} MCN 1 and MPN. To this end, we used the tachykinin receptor antagonist Spantide I to eliminate the actions of CabTRP Ia. With Spantide I present, MCN 1 no longer elicited the gastric mill rhythm and the resulting pyloric rhythm was changed. Although this rhythm was more similar to the MPN-elicited pyloric rhythm, these rhythms remained different. Thus, CabTRP Ia partially confers the differences in rhythm generation resulting from MPN versus MCN 1 activation. This result suggests that different projection neurons may use the same cotransmitters differently to elicit distinct pyloric rhythms. It also supports the hypothesis that different projection neurons use a combination of strategies, including using distinct cotransmitter complements, to elicit different outputs from the same neuronal network.
