5|$|All {{specimens}} of Ocepeia {{come from the}} Ouled Abdoun Basin of Morocco, a phosphate basin. Research on Ocepeia {{has been carried out}} by French and Moroccan researchers led by Dr. Emmanuel Gheerbrant of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris. Ocepeia fossils have been recovered from the Grand Daoui, Meraa El Arech, and Sidi Chennane quarries, with the latter bearing the most complete specimens. Some of the original <b>material</b> <b>was</b> collected on-site as early as 1997, while other <b>material</b> <b>was</b> obtained from fossil dealers.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 2 million {{pieces of}} debris were recovered and brought ashore for inspection at a secure handling facility in a marine industrial park at Sheet Harbour, where small <b>material</b> <b>was</b> hand inspected by teams of RCMP officers looking for human remains, personal effects, and valuables from the aircraft's cargo hold. The <b>material</b> <b>was</b> then transported to CFB Shearwater, {{where it was}} assembled and inspected by over 350investigators from multiple organizations, such as the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, U.S. Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), Air Accidents Investigation Branch, Boeing, Pratt & Whitney, and Swissair.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{background}} and design {{idea of the}} intelligent <b>materials</b> <b>is</b> introduced. Three elements of intelligent <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> given. Then based on classifying of intelligent materials, the features and applications of intelligent <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> researched. Principle and the latest applications of typical intelligent materials such as optical fiber, shape memory alloys, shape memory polymers, piezoelectric, magnetostrictive materials, fluid material and polymer colloid are analyzed simplely. The research difficulties and the future research focuses of intelligent <b>material</b> <b>are</b> pointed out. Introduction of Intelligent <b>Materials</b> Intelligent <b>material</b> <b>is</b> the fourth generation materials after the natural materials, polymer materials and artificial <b>materials,</b> it <b>is</b> {{one of the important}} development directions of the modern high-tech materials.

50|$|Parent <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> {{classified}} {{according to}} how they came to <b>be</b> deposited. Residual <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> mineral <b>materials</b> that have weathered in place from primary bedrock. Transported <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> {{those that have been}} deposited by water, wind, ice or gravity. Cumulose <b>material</b> <b>is</b> organic matter that has grown and accumulates in place.|$|R
50|$|Most {{applications}} of linseed oil exploit its drying properties, i.e., the initial <b>material</b> <b>is</b> liquid {{or at least}} pliable and the aged <b>material</b> <b>is</b> rigid but not brittle. The water-repelling (hydrophobic) nature of the resulting hydrocarbon-based <b>material</b> <b>is</b> advantageous.|$|R
5|$|At Oak Ridge, uranium slugs were {{irradiated}} for 40 days, {{then left}} {{to cool down}} for 1 to 5 days, then dissolved. Barium then was extracted and the solution evaporated; the solid <b>material</b> <b>was</b> then shipped to Los Alamos. As of 1949, full production runs involved up to 1728 slugs (34.5 batches of 50 slugs). Until 1949 the Oak Ridge production site processed uranium slugs irradiated both on-site and at Hanford; afterward only Hanford <b>material</b> <b>was</b> processed.|$|E
5|$|Copper-bearing <b>material</b> <b>was</b> smelted {{to produce}} black copper, {{containing}} impurities such as lead, tin and zinc. Black copper was refined using oxygen, producing 98% copper, {{along with a}} zinc oxide residue and a slag containing lead, tin, nickel {{and a number of}} heavy metals.|$|E
5|$|Massospondylus {{had also}} been {{reported}} from Argentina, but this has been reassessed as a closely related but distinct genus. The fossils included several partial skeletons {{and at least one}} skull, found in the Lower Jurassic Canon del Colorado Formation of San Juan, Argentina.

40|$|Abstract. Research and {{development}} in nanostructured <b>materials</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the most}} intensely studied areas in science. As a result of concerted R & D efforts, nanostructured electronic and magnetic materials have achieved commercial suc-cess. Specific examples of novel industrially important nanostructured electronic and magnetic <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> provided. Advantages of nanocrystalline magnetic mate-rials in the context of both <b>materials</b> and devices <b>are</b> discussed. Several high tech-nology examples of the use of nanostructured magnetic <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> presented. Methods of processing nanostructured <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> described and the examples of sol gel, rapid solidification and powder injection moulding as potential processing methods for making nanostructured <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> outlined.

50|$|If χ <b>is</b> positive, a <b>material</b> can <b>be</b> para{{magnetic}}. In this case, {{the magnetic}} field in the <b>material</b> <b>is</b> strengthened by the induced magnetization. Alternatively, if χ <b>is</b> negative, the <b>material</b> <b>is</b> diamagnetic. In this case, {{the magnetic field}} in the <b>material</b> <b>is</b> weakened by the induced magnetization. Generally, non-magnetic <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> said to be para- or diamagnetic {{because they do not}} possess permanent magnetization without external magnetic field. Ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, or antiferromagnetic materials have positive susceptibility and possess permanent magnetization even without external magnetic field.|$|R

5|$|A {{tabletop}} roleplaying game {{based on}} the series was created by Clint Krause. Other merchandise included posters, scarves, playing cards, a plushie, postcards, a signed puzzle kit, and T-shirts. Additionally, a two-and-a-half-hour DVD commentary about the first Bizenghast volume, with Tokyopop editor interviews and bonus <b>material,</b> <b>was</b> planned {{to be released in}} mid-August 2010.|$|E
5|$|Aetosaur <b>material</b> <b>was</b> first {{described}} by Swiss paleontologist Louis Agassiz in 1844. He named the genus Stagonolepis from the Lossiemouth Sandstone in Elgin, Scotland, but considered {{it to be}} a Devonian fish rather than a Triassic reptile. This may be because he considered the strata {{to be part of the}} Old Red Sandstone, and thus Paleozoic in age. Agassiz mistook the osteoderms for large rhomboidal scales, which he thought were arranged in a similar pattern to those of gars. He also thought that these supposed scales were very similar to those of the lobe-finned fish Megalichthys due to their large size.|$|E
5|$|After {{the alarm}} had been raised, a major {{investigation}} commenced involving detectives from the Dublin Metropolitan North Central Division and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI). The {{house and the}} surrounding area were subject to a forensic examination by the Garda Technical Bureau. Gardaí performed house to house inquiries, took more than 1000 statements, and interviewed over 250 suspects. A postmortem examination of the bodies was made by the State Pathologist, Professor John Harbison; his first report was delivered on 13 March 1997. No <b>material</b> <b>was</b> found either by the forensic examination of the scene or by the postmortem examination that would have linked a suspect to the crime.|$|E
50|$|<b>Materials</b> <b>are</b> of {{the utmost}} {{importance}} for engineers, as the usage of the appropriate <b>materials</b> <b>is</b> crucial when designing systems. As a result, <b>materials</b> science <b>is</b> an increasingly important part of an engineer's education.|$|R

5|$|Apatosaurus alenquerensis {{was named}} in 1957 by Albert-Félix de Lapparent and Georges Zbyweski. It {{was based on}} post cranial {{material}} from Portugal. In 1990 this <b>material</b> <b>was</b> reassigned to Camarasaurus, but in 1998 it was given its own genus, Lourinhasaurus. This was further supported by the findings of Tschopp etal. in 2015, where Lourinhasaurus {{was found to be}} sister to Camarasaurus and other camarasaurids.|$|E
5|$|As {{the film}} was budgeted for two weeks of {{post-production}} photography, late 1976 saw three separate shoots for the final segment, but only some of this <b>material</b> <b>was</b> used. The narration that ends the film, featuring the joke about 'we all need the eggs', was conceived and recorded only two hours before a test screening.|$|E
5|$|At the time, no type {{specimen}} was specified, as the practice only arose later, in the 19th century. When a lectotype (type selected amongst original <b>material)</b> <b>was</b> designated, it {{was assigned to}} specimen 242.1 of Linnaeus' herbarium, the only V.thapsus specimen. The species had previously been designated as type species for Verbascum. European plants exhibit considerable phenotypical variation, {{which has led to}} the plant acquiring many synonyms over the years. Introduced American populations show much less variation.|$|E

5|$|Author Roald Dahl {{disapproved of}} the 1971 film {{adaptation}} and declined the film rights {{to produce the}} sequel, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator. Warner Bros. and Brillstein-Grey Entertainment entered discussions with the Dahl estate in 1991, hoping to purchase the rights to produce another film version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The purchase was finalized in 1998, with Dahl's widow, Felicity ("Liccy"), and daughter, Lucy, receiving total artistic control and final privilege on the choices of actors, directors and writers. The Dahl Estate's subsequent protection of the source <b>material</b> <b>was</b> the main reason that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory had languished in development hell since the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Avex Trax hired Japanese {{musician}} Max Matsuura {{to produce}} the entire record, alongside with Hamasaki and Japanese musician Naoto Suzuki's help, while Hamasaki wrote every song on the album. Recording sessions were handled at Prime Sound Studio, Studio Sound Dali, and Onkio Haus in Tokyo, Japan, and at Soundtrack Studios in New York City, United States; the final <b>material</b> <b>was</b> then mixed at Studio Sound Dali and Conway Studios in Los Angeles, California, and mastered by Eddy Schreyer at Oasis Masterings.|$|E
5|$|Bach led {{the first}} {{performance}} of the cantata on 16 June 1715. The performance material for Weimar is lost. Bach performed the work again as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. Extant performance <b>material</b> <b>was</b> prepared by his assistant Johann Christian Köpping. The first possible revival is the Trinity Sunday of Bach's first year in office, 4 June 1724, also the conclusion of his first year and first Leipzig cantata cycle, because he had assumed the office on the first Sunday after Trinity the year before. Bach made presumably minor changes.|$|E
