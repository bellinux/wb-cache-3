5000|$|<b>Methionine</b> <b>Sulfoximine</b> (MSO): MSO is an {{inhibitor}} {{that binds}} to the glutamate site. Bound to GS, MSO is phosphorylated by ATP {{that results in}} an irreversible, non-covalent inhibition of GS. The S-isomer configuration is more inhibitory. Glutamate entry is blocked into the active site by a stabilization of the flexible loop in the active site by MSO.|$|E
50|$|Sulfoximides (also called sulfoximines) are tetracoordinate sulfur-nitrogen compounds, isoelectronic with sulfones, {{in which}} one oxygen atom of the sulfone is {{replaced}} by a substituted nitrogen atom, e.g., R2S(O)=NR′. When two different R groups are attached to sulfur, sulfoximides are chiral. Much of the interest in this class of compounds is derived from the discovery that methionine sulfoximide (<b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine)</b> is an inhibitor of glutamine synthetase.|$|E

40|$|The convulsant agent <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> {{inhibits}} brain glutamine synthetase irreversibly and the inhibitor becomes {{bound to}} the active site of the enzyme as <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> phosphate. Only {{one of the four}} isomers of <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine,</b> L-methionine-S-sulfoximine, inhibits glutamine synthetase. In the present work, D-methionine-SR-sulfoximine, and highly purified preparations of L-methionine-S-sulfoximine and L-methionine-R-sulfoximine were tested in mice for convulsant activity; only L-methionine-S-sulfoximine produced convulsions. The finding that only one of the four optical isomers of <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> induces convulsions, and that only this same isomer inhibits glutamine synthetase, lends support to the conclusion that these two effects of <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> are closely connected...|$|E

It is known that <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> inhibits glutamine synthetase and hence blocks ammonia assimilation. <b>Methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> does not inhibit ammonia transport in R. sphaeroides; therefore, these results suggest that limited metabolism via a specific pathway is required subsequent to transport to elicit a chemotactic response to ammonia.

40|$|Ammonium {{suppresses}} nitrogenase {{activity in}} Anabaena flos-aquae (Lyng) Breb. at all pH values tested. l-Methionine-dl-sulfoximine at 1 millimolar totally inhibited glutamine synthetase, and 10 micromolar partially inhibited. Both concentrations protected nitrogenase activity from ammonium-induced suppression at pH 7. 1 and 8. 1. At pH 9. 3 and 10. 2, <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> did not alleviate {{the suppression of}} nitrogenase by ammonium. This pH-dependent protection of nitrogenase activity {{is a result of}} the noncompetitive inhibition of the ammonium transporter by <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine.</b> At pH 7. 1 and 8. 2, ammonium is protonated and <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> inhibits its entry into the cell. At pH 9. 3 and 10. 2, unprotonated ammonia is abundant and may enter the cell independent of the transport system. The effects of ammonium are closely mimicked by the ammonium analog methylamine. These results suggest that ammonium per se is an important in vivo regulator of nitrogen fixation and its function can be mimicked by methylamine. Previous studies employing <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> may have to be re-evaluated in light of the inhibitory effects of <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> on the ammonium transporter...|$|E

Wild-type Klebsiella is resistant to 0. 1 M <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> or methionine sulfone, whereas the gltD mutant is sensitive to 1 mM concentrations. Either glutamate or glutamine is effective in overcoming this inhibition. Activities of both glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthetase, two enzymes involved in the second pathway of glutamate synthesis, are inhibited by <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> and methionine sulfone.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> and {{ammonium}} chloride on [14 C] glutamate metabolism in excised leaves of Triticum aestivum were investigated. Glutamine {{was the principal}} product derived from [U 14 C]glutamate in the light {{and in the absence}} of inhibitor or NH 4 Cl. Other amino acids, organic acids, sugars, sugar phosphates, and CO 2 became slightly radioactive. Ammonium chloride (10 mm) increased formation of [14 C] glutamine, aspartate, citrate, and malate but decreased incorporation into 2 -oxoglutarate, alanine, and 14 CO 2. <b>Methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> (1 mm) suppressed glutamine synthesis, caused NH 3 to accumulate, increased metabolism of the added radioactive glutamate, decreased tissue levels of glutamate, and decreased incorporation of radioactivity into other amino acids. <b>Methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> also caused most of the 14 C from [U- 14 C]glutamate to be incorporated into malate and succinate, whereas most of the 14 C from [1 - 14 C]glutamate was metabolized to CO 2 and sugar phosphates. Thus, formation of radioactive organic acids in the presence of <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> does not take place indirectly through “dark” fixation of CO 2 released by degradation of glutamate when ammonia assimilation is blocked. When illuminated leaves supplied with [U- 14 C] glutamate without inhibitor or NH 4 Cl were transferred to darkness, there was increased metabolism of the glutamate to glutamine, aspartate, succinate, malate, and 14 CO 2. Darkening had little effect on the labeling pattern in leaves treated with <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> {{inhibits}} {{the growth}} of Salmonella typhimurium at a concentration of 50 μM, {{and the addition of}} glutamine, but not glutamate, is sufficient to overcome this inhibition. The analogue causes 50 % inhibition of glutamine synthetase activity at 2 to 4 μM and of glutamate synthase at 2 to 3 mM when these enzymes are assayed in vitro. No inhibition of glutamate dehydrogenase activity is observed at analogue concentrations as high as 50 mM. Two mutants selected for their resistance to <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> inhibition have a partial growth requirement for glutamine and a reduction in the glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase activities. The sensitivity of the remaining glutamine synthetase activity in these mutants to <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> inhibition appears unaltered, and the lesions conferring the analogue resistance may not affect glutamine synthetase directly...|$|E
40|$|<b>Methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> induced {{release of}} ammonia from {{illuminated}} cells of Ankistrodesmus braunii (Naegeli) Brunnth, in normal air, but less in air enriched to 3 % CO 2. In normal air, <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> also induced glycolate release. Addition of either glutamate, glycine, or serine suppressed glycolate release, whereas glutamate and glycine {{at the same}} time stimulated ammonia release. The results indicate that inhibition of glutamine synthetase and thereby inhibition of photorespiratory nitrogen cycling restricts the sink capacity for glycolate in the photorespiratory carbon cycle. An external supply of glutamate, glycine, or serine seems to stimulate glyoxylate transamination and thus partly restores the sink capacity. Calculations of total glycolate formation rates in air from glycolate and ammonia release rates in the presence of <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> and glutamate revealed values of approximately 20 micromoles glycolate per milligram chlorophyll per hour on the average. Similar calculations led to an estimated rate of photorespiratory ammonia release in air, in the absence of <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine,</b> of about 10 micromoles per milligram chlorophyll per hour on the average, a value comparable to the primary nitrogen assimilation rate of 8 micromoles per milligram chlorophyll per hour...|$|E

40|$|When Lemna minor L. is {{supplied}} with the potent inhibitor of glutamine synthetase, <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine,</b> rapid changes in {{free amino acid}} levels occur. Glutamine, glutamate, asparagine, aspartate, alanine, and serine levels decline concomitantly with ammonia accumulation. However, not all free amino acid pools deplete {{in response to this}} inhibitor. Several free amino acids including proline, valine, leucine, isoleucine, threonine, lysine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, histidine, and methionine exhibit severalfold accumulations within 24 hours of <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> treatment. To investigate whether these latter amino acid accumulations result from de novo synthesis via a <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> insensitive pathway of ammonia assimilation (e. g. glutamate dehydrogenase) or from protein turnover, fronds of Lemna minor were prelabeled with [15 N]H 4 + prior to supplying the inhibitor. Analyses of the 15 N abundance of free amino acids suggest that protein turnover is the major source of these <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> induced amino acid accumulations. Thus, the pools of valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, and threonine accumulated in response to the inhibitor in the presence of [15 N]H 4 +, are 14 N enriched and are not apparently derived from 15 N-labeled precursors. To account for the selective accumulation of amino acids, such as valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, and threonine, it is necessary to envisage that these free amino acids are relatively poorly catabolized in vivo. The amino acids which deplete in response to <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> (i. e. glutamate, glutamine, alanine, aspartate, asparagine, and serine) are all presumably rapidly catabolized to ammonia, either in the photorespiratory pathway or by alternative routes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Seizures are {{the result}} of a sudden and {{temporary}} synchronization of neuronal activity, the reason for which is not clearly understood. Astrocytes participate in the control of neurotransmitter storage and neurotransmission efficacy. They provide fuel to neurons, which need a high level of energy to sustain normal and pathological neuronal activities, such as during epilepsy. Various genetic or induced animal models have been developed and used to study epileptogenic mechanisms. <b>Methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> induces both seizures and the accumulation of brain glycogen, which might be considered as a putative energy store to neurons in various animals. Animals subjected to <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> develop seizures similar to the most striking form of human epilepsy, with a long pre-convulsive period of several hours, a long convulsive period during up to 48 hours and a post convulsive period during which they recover normal behavior. The accumulation of brain glycogen has been demonstrated in both the cortex and cerebellum as early as the pre-convulsive period, indicating that this accumulation is not a consequence of seizures. The accumulation results from an activation of gluconeogenesis specifically localized to astrocytes, both in vivo and in vitro. Both seizures and brain glycogen accumulation vary when using different inbred strains of mice. C 57 BL/ 6 J is the most “resistant ” strain to <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine,</b> while CBA/J is the most “sensitive ” one.

40|$|Regulation of the {{synthesis}} and activity of glutamine synthetase (GS) in the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain 7120 was studied by determining GS transferase activity and GS antigen concentration under {{a variety of}} conditions. Extracts prepared from cells growing exponentially on a medium supplemented with combined nitrogen had a GS activity of 17 mumol of gamma-glutamyl transferase activity per min per mg of protein at 37 degrees C. This activity doubled in 12 h after transfer of cells to a nitrogen-free medium, corresponding to the time required for heterocyst differentiation and the start of nitrogen fixation. Addition of NH 3 to a culture 11 h after an inducing transfer immediately blocked the increase in GS activity. In the Enterobacteriaceae, addition of NH 3 after induction results in the covalent modification of GS by adenylylation. The GS of Anabaena is not adenylylated by such a protocol, as shown by the resistance of the transferase activity of the enzyme to inhibition by Mg 2 + and by the failure of the enzyme to incorporate 32 P after NH 3 upshift. <b>Methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> inhibited Anabaena GS activity rapidly and irreversibly in vivo. After the addition of <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> to Anabaena, the level of GS antigen neither increased nor decreased, indicating that Glutamine cannot be the only small molecule capable of regulating GS synthesis. <b>Methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> permitted heterocyst differentiation and nitrogenase induction to escape repression by NH 3. Nitrogen-fixing cultures treated with <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> excreted NH 3. The fern Azolla caroliniana contains an Anabaena species living in symbiotic association. The Anabaena species carries out nitrogen fixation sufficient to satisfy all of the combined nitrogen requirements of the host fern. Experiments by other workers have shown that the activity of GS in the symbiont is significantly lower than the activity of GS in free-living Anabaena. Using a sensitive radioimmune assay and a normalization procedure based on the content of diaminopimelic acid, a component unique to the symbiont, we found that the level of GS antigen in the symbiont was about 5 % of the level in free-living Anabaena cells. Thus, the host fern appears to repress synthesis of Anabaena GS in the symbiotic association...|$|E

40|$|The {{amino acid}} {{concentrations}} in the phototrophic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum were measured during growth under nif-repressing and nif-derepressing conditions. The effects of ammonium, glutamine, darkness, phenazine methosulfate, and the inhibitors <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> and azaserine on amino acid levels of cells were tested. The changes were compared to changes in whole-cell nitrogenase activity and ADP-ribosylation of dinitrogenase reductase. Glutamate was the dominant amino acid under every growth condition. Glutamine levels were equivalent when cells were grown on high-ammonia (nif-repressing) medium or glutamate (nif-derepressing) medium. Thus, glutamine is not the solitary agent that controls nif expression. No other amino acid correlated with nif expression. Glutamine concentrations rose sharply when either glutamate-grown or N-starved cells were treated with ammonia, glutamine, or azaserine. Glutamine levels showed little change upon treatment of the cells with darkness or ammonium plus <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine.</b> Treatment with phenazine methosulfate resulted in a decrease in glutamine concentration. The glutamine concentration varied independently of dinitrogenase reductase ADP-ribosylation, and it is concluded that an increase in glutamine concentration is neither necessary nor sufficient to initiate the modification of dinitrogenase reductase. No other amino acid exhibited changes in concentration that correlated consistently with modification. Glutamine synthetase activity and nitrogenase activity were not coregulated under all conditions, and thus the two regulatory cascades perceive different signal(s) under at least some conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of the methanogenic archaebacterium Methanococcus voltae to 12 inhibitors was tested in liquid medium. Four compounds appeared to be inhibitors of growth. Their MICs were as follows: pseudomonic acid, 0. 1 micrograms/ml (0. 19 microM); puromycin, 2 micrograms/ml (3. 6 microM); <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine,</b> 30 micrograms/ml (170 microM); and fusidic acid, 100 micrograms/ml (170 microM). On solid medium, the MICs were similar {{and the frequency of}} spontaneous resistance was found to be 5 X 10 (- 5) (<b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine),</b> 10 (- 7) (pseudomonic acid), and less than 10 (- 7) (puromycin and fusidic acid). Pseudomonic acid was found to inhibit isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase activity as measured by the in vitro aminoacylation of M. voltae tRNA with L-[U- 14 C]isoleucine. Fusidic acid and puromycin were shown to inhibit poly(U) -dependent polyphenylalanine synthesis in S 30 extracts. Acetylpuromycin was inhibitory at much higher concentrations both in vivo and in vitro for M. voltae. Thus, the pac gene of Streptomyces alboniger, which is responsible for acetylation of puromycin and which conferred resistance to puromycin when introduced in eubacteria and eucaryotes, is a potential selective marker in gene transfer experiments with M. voltae. The latter was recently shown to be transformable. The same would be true for the cat gene of Tn 9, which encodes resistance to fusidic acid in eubacteria in addition to resistance to chloramphenicol...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} initial {{product of}} metabolism of [13 N]N 2 and 13 NH 4 + by five diverse cyanobacteria is glutamine. <b>Methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> inhibits formation of [13 N]glutamine {{except in the}} case of Gloeothece sp., an organism with a thick sheath through which the inhibitor may not penetrate. Thus, glutamine synthetase appears to catalyze the initial step in the assimilation of N 2 -derived or exogenous NH 4 + by these organisms. [13 N]Glutamate is, in all cases, the second major product of assimilation of 13 N-labeled N 2 and NH 4 +. In all of the N 2 -fixing cyanobacteria studied, the fraction of 13 N in glutamine declines and that in glutamate increases with increasing times of assimilation of [13 N]N 2 and 13 NH 4 +, and (Gloeothece again excepted) <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> reduces incorporation of 13 N into glutamate as well as into glutamine. Glutamate synthase therefore appears to catalyze the formation of glutamate {{in a wide range of}} N 2 -fixing cyanobacteria. However, the major fraction of [13 N]glutamate formed by Anacystis nidulans incubated with 13 NH 4 + may be formed by glutamic acid dehydrogenase.

40|$|Chlorsulfuron, an {{inhibitor}} of acetolactate synthase (EC 4. 1. 3. 18) (TB Ray 1984 Plant Physiol 75 : 827 - 831), markedly inhibited {{the growth}} of Lemna minor at concentrations of 10 − 8 molar and above, but had no inhibitory effects on growth at 10 − 9 molar. At growth inhibitory concentrations, chlorsulfuron caused a pronounced increase in total free amino acid levels within 24 hours. Valine, leucine, and isoleucine, however, became smaller percentages of the total free amino acid pool as the concentration of chlorsulfuron was increased. At concentrations of chlorsulfuron of 10 − 8 molar and above, a new amino acid was accumulated in the free pool. This amino acid was identified as α-amino-n-butyrate by chemical ionization and electron impact gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The amount of α-amino-n-butyrate increased from undetectable levels in untreated plants, to as high as 840 nanomoles per gram fresh weight (2. 44 % of the total free pool) in plants treated with 10 − 4 molar chlorsulfuron for 24 hours. The accumulation of this amino acid was completely inhibited by <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine.</b> Chlorsulfuron did not inhibit the <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> induced accumulations of valine, leucine, and isoleucine, supporting {{the idea that the}} accumulation of the branched-chain amino acids in <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> treated plants is the result of protein turnover rather than enhanced synthesis. Protein turnover may be primarily responsible for the failure to achieve complete depletion of valine, leucine, and isoleucine even at concentrations of chlorsulfuron some 104 times greater than that required to inhibit growth. Tracer studies with 15 N demonstrate that chlorsulfuron inhibits the incorporation of 15 N into valine, leucine, and isoleucine. The α-amino-n-butyrate accumulated in the presence of chlorsulfuron and [15 N]H 4 + was heavily labeled with 15 N at early time points and appeared to be derived by transamination from a rapidly labeled amino acid such as glutamate or alanine. We propose that chlorsulfuron inhibition of acetolactate synthase may lead to accumulation of 2 -oxobutyrate in the isoleucine branch of the pathway, and transamination of 2 -oxobutyrate to α-amino-n-butyrate by a constitutive transaminase utilizing either glutamate or alanine as α-amino-N donors...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the regulation of}} HvNRT 2, genes that encode high-affinity NO 3 − transporters in barley (Hordeum vulgare) roots, seedlings were treated with 10 mm NO 3 − in {{the presence or absence}} of amino acids (aspartate, asparagine, glutamate [Glu], and glutamine [Gln]), NH 4 +, and/or inhibitors of N assimilation. Although all amino acids decreased high-affinity 13 NO 3 − influx and HvNRT 2 transcript abundance, there was substantial interconversion of administered amino acids, making it impossible to determine which amino acid(s) were responsible for the observed effects. To clarify the role of individual amino acids, plants were separately treated with tungstate, <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine,</b> or azaserine (inhibitors of nitrate reductase, Gln synthetase, and Glu synthase, respectively). Tungstate increased the HvNRT 2 transcript by 20 % to 30 % and decreased NO 3 − influx by 50 %, indicating that NO 3 − itself does not regulate transcript abundance, but may exert post-transcriptional effects. Experiments with <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> suggested that NH 4 + may down-regulate HvNRT 2 gene expression and high-affinity NO 3 − influx by effects operating at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Azaserine decreased HvNRT 2 transcript levels and NO 3 − influx by 97 % and 95 %, respectively, while decreasing Glu and increasing Gln levels.

Xanthi) cells cultured on nitrate, urea, or ammonium succinate as the sole source of nitrogen, and of 13 NO 3 − by tobacco cells cultured on nitrate. The percentage of organic 13 N in glutamate, and subsequently, alanine, increases with increasing periods of assimilation. 13 NO 3 −, used {{for the first time}} in a study of assimilation of nitrogen, was purified by new preparative techniques. During pulse-chase experiments, there is a decrease in the percentage of 13 N in glutamine, and a concomitant increase in the percentage of 13 N in glutamate and alanine. <b>Methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> inhibits the incorporation of 13 N from 13 NH 4 + into glutamine more extensively than it inhibits the incorporation of 13 N into glutamate, with cells grown on any of the three sources of nitrogen. Azaserine inhibits glutamate synthesis extensively when 13 NH 4 + is fed to cells cultured on nitrate. These results indicate that the major route for assimilation of 13 NH 4 + is the glutamine synthetase-glutamate synthase pathway, and that glutamate dehydrogenase also plays a role, but a minor one. <b>Methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> inhibits the incorporation of 13 N from 13 NO 3 − into glutamate more strongly than it inhibits the incorporation of 13 N into glutamine, suggesting that the assimilation of 13 NH 4 + derived from 13 NO 3 − may be mediated solely by the glutamine synthetase-glutamate synthase pathway...|$|E
40|$|Rhodobacter sphaeroides {{maintained}} intracellular ammonium {{pools of}} 1. 1 to 2. 6 mM during growth in several fixed nitrogen sources {{as well as}} during diazotrophic growth. Addition of 0. 15 mM NH 4 + to washed, nitrogen-free cell suspensions was followed by linear uptake of NH 4 + from the medium and transient formation of intracellular pools of 0. 9 to 1. 5 mM NH 4 +. Transport of NH 4 + was shown to be independent of assimilation by glutamine synthetase because intracellular pools of over 1 mM represented NH 4 + concentration gradients of at least 100 -fold across the cytoplasmic membrane. Ammonium pools of over 1 mM were also found in non-growing cell suspensions in nitrogen-free medium after glutamine synthetase was inhibited with <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine.</b> In NH 4 +-free cell suspensions, methylammonium (14 CH 3 NH 3 +) was taken up rapidly, and intracellular concentrations of 0. 4 to 0. 5 mM were maintained. The 14 CH 3 NH 3 + pool was not affected by <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine.</b> Unlike NH 4 + uptake, 14 CH 3 NH 3 + uptake in nitrogen-free cell suspensions was repressed by growth in NH 4 +. These results suggest that R. sphaeroides may produce an NH 4 +-specific transport system {{in addition to the}} NH 4 +/ 14 CH 3 NH 3 + transporter. This second transporter is able to produce normal-size NH 4 + pools but has very little affinity for 14 CH 3 NH 3 + and is not repressed by growth in high concentrations of NH 4 +...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. To {{examine the}} impact of {{experimental}} ischemia and interruption of glutamate transport on retinal neuronal cell, especially retinal ganglion cell (RGC), survival in vitro. METHODS. Cell cultures were prepared from adult pig retinas and maintained under different experimental conditions of increasing hypoglycemia, environmental hypoxia (delayed postmortem period or atmospheric PO 2 � 2 %), or chemical hypoxia (potassium cyanide), or in the presence of glutamate transporter blockers L-trans-pyrrolidine- 2, 4 -dicarboxylic acid (tPDC) and L(�) -threo- 3 -hydroxyaspartic acid (THA), or the glutamine synthetase inhibitor <b>methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> (MS). After 48 hours, cells were returned to standard culture conditions and allowed to develop for 5 days, when they were fixed and immunostained with different retinal neuronal phenotypic markers...|$|E
40|$|Barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv Golden Promise) {{plants were}} grown in a {{continuous}} culture {{system in which the}} root and shoot ammonia and amino acid levels were constant over a 6 -hour experimental period. <b>Methionine</b> <b>sulfoximine</b> (MSO), 1 millimolarity when added to the culture medium, caused a total inactivation of root glutamine synthetase with little effect on the shoot enzyme. Root ammonia levels increased and glutamine levels decreased, irrespective of whether the plants were grown in 1 millimolar nitrate or 1 millimolar ammonia. Levels of glutamate, aspartate, serine, threonine, and asparagine all increased. There was little alteration in the amino acid and ammonia levels in the shoot, suggesting that MSO is not rapidly transported...|$|E
