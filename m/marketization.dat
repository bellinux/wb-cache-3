Work–family balance issues also differ by class, since middle class occupations provide more benefits and family support while low-wage jobs are less flexible with benefits.

The Great Plains or Palliser Triangle area to the south was mainly used for ranching economies. In {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, Saskatchewan farmers created cooperative organizations to maintain grain <b>marketization.</b> During the drought and depression of the 1930s, the population decreased as immigration nearly ended and numerous families left. During World War II, conservation programs and the increased demand for grain revived the economy.|$|E
25|$|Economic {{globalization}} {{refers to}} the free movement of goods, capital, services, technology and information. It is the increasing economic integration and interdependence of national, regional, and local economies across the world through an intensification of cross-border movement of goods, services, technologies and capital. Whereas globalization is a broad set of processes concerning multiple networks of economic, political, and cultural interchange, contemporary economic globalization is propelled by the rapid growing significance of information in all types of productive activities and <b>marketization,</b> and by developments in science and technology.|$|E
25|$|The {{comprehensive}} and wide-ranging reforms created political differences over {{the pace of}} <b>marketization</b> and the control over the ideology that came with it, opening a deep chasm within the central leadership. The reformers ("the right", led by Hu Yaobang) favoured political liberalization and a plurality of ideas as a channel to voice popular discontent, and pressed for further reforms. The conservatives ("the left", led by Chen Yun) said that the reforms had gone too far, and advocated a return to greater state control to ensure social stability and to better align with the party's socialist ideology. Both sides needed the backing of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to carry out important policy decisions.|$|E

The Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development (until 2008 the Ministry of Construction) oversees financing for urban water and sanitation infrastructure as well as policies concerning the regulation of water and sanitation utilities. Some important policy papers it has issued are “Accelerating the <b>Marketization</b> of Public Utilities” (No.272 Policy Paper of the MOC, 2002), the “Measure on Public Utilities Concession Management” (No.126 Policy Paper of the MOC, 2004), and the “Opinions on Strengthening Regulation of Public Utilities” (No.154 Policy Paper of the MOC, 2005). However, there is no law concerning the regulation of public utilities or private sector participation in the sector.

Nikolai Ryzhkov, the future Chairman of the Council of Ministers, referred in a 1987 speech to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to the [...] "sad experiences of the 1965 reform", and claimed that everything went from bad to worse following the reform's cancellation.|$|E
500|$|The governments led by General Jaruzelski, {{throughout}} their existence (1981–1989), engaged in market economy reforms, {{aimed at improving}} economic performance by eliminating central planning, reducing central bureaucracy, introducing self-management and self-financing of state enterprises and allowing self-government by employee councils. The reform's effects were positive but limited (the process vastly increased general economic literacy {{and some of its}} accomplishments were later claimed by Solidarity governments as their own), because enterprises' self-rule had to compete with the traditional party interference, the authorities shied from subjecting the population to hardships, and Western governments and institutions showed no interest in supporting what was perceived as reform of a communist regime. The government allowed more small-scale private enterprises to function, departing further from the 'socialist' model of economy. Ideological considerations were abandoned and priority was given to pragmatic issues and moves. Searching for ways to improve the economy and conscious of its alienation from the industrial working class, the regime turned toward market reforms with an increasingly significant elite-oriented liberal (from the mid-1980s) component. <b>Marketization,</b> formalized by a 1988 statute on economic activity, was a process that would continue past the mid-1990s. Neoliberal processes may have been initiated by Deputy Prime Minister [...] and the government of Zbigniew Messner, then developed further under Minister Mieczysław Wilczek (author of the statute) and Mieczysław Rakowski's government. [...] "Market socialism" [...] was introduced, as the regime leaders actually lost their faith in the socialist system and even the nomenklatura managers were threatened by the declining economy. The enterprises were to be made independent, self-financing and self-managed, which included workers' councils that were resistant to restructuring. Owners of private businesses did well in the final years of the People's Republic and the number of such entities increased. Foreign investment was also encouraged, but limited <b>marketization</b> failed to deliver an economic turnaround. The practice of centralized economic decision making had not been overcome, while the newly autonomous enterprises moved toward a rather spontaneous, chaotic partial privatization of dubious legality that included elements of kleptocracy and had a significant middle-level nomenklatura component. On a more basic level, countless ordinary Poles took advantage of the changing attitudes and became involved in a great variety of income-producing activities.|$|E
500|$|In recent years, the CPC {{has been}} {{especially}} interested in Latin America, {{as shown by the}} increasing number of delegates sent to and received from these countries. Of special fascination for the CPC is the 71-year-long rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in Mexico. While the CPC attributed the PRI's long reign in power to the strong presidential system, tapping into the machismo culture of the country, its nationalist posture, its close identification with the rural populace and the implementation of nationalization alongside the <b>marketization</b> of the economy, [...] the CPC concluded that the PRI failed {{because of the lack of}} inner-party democracy, its pursuit of social democracy, its rigid party structures that could not be reformed, its political corruption, the pressure of globalization, and American interference in Mexican politics. While the CPC was slow to recognize the pink tide in Latin America, it has strengthened party-to-party relations with several socialist and anti-American political parties over the years. The CPC has occasionally expressed some irritation over Hugo Chávez's anti-capitalist and anti-American rhetoric. Despite this, in 2013 the CPC reached an agreement with the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), which was founded by Chávez, for the CPC to educate PSUV cadres in political and social fields. By 2008, the CPC claimed to have established relations with 99 political parties in 29 Latin American countries.|$|E
500|$|... l. The {{processes}} of the Polish transformation resulted in a considerable loss of economic potential and people who depended on such potential were deprived of means to support their existence. Gross national income dropped by over 18% within two years, which in Poland amounted to a deepest recession since the Great Depression crisis of 1929–33. The ideologically motivated, frenetic privatization, a sell out of best state enterprises {{for a fraction of}} their worth, was called by Aleksander Małachowski a [...] "reform by ruin". According to Karol Modzelewski (2013), the psychological, cultural and political consequences of the social degradation experienced still burden everyday life of the Poles and threaten the regained freedom. The trauma of the great transformation has been exploited by right-wing populists. David Ost wrote the following (2016), referring to the [...] "post-communist" [...] Democratic Left Alliance, its ascent to power and its decline in 1993–1997 and 2001–2005: [...] "Twice before PiS first came to power, parties aligned with the liberal left secured strong labor support. But by insisting on <b>marketization,</b> privatization and participation (as a peripheral player) in the global capitalist economy, and disparaging demands for more security, they soon squandered that support, and ended up driving regular workers into the arms of PiS." [...] Then in 2007–2015, [...] "market liberals of Civic Platform (...) pursued a pragmatic politics of adapting to the European Union (...) while suicidally pursuing a hard agenda against workers." [...] Economic insecurity having fueled the rise of the Right as elsewhere in Europe, [...] "Kaczyński won in 2015 by focusing on economic issues" [...] and because of PiS' [...] "promise of economic security".|$|E

Eikenberry and Kluver, in their article entitled, “The <b>Marketization</b> of the Nonprofit Sector: Civil Society at Risk,” describes the idea that <b>marketization</b> trends negatively impact the unique roles nonprofit organizations play within society.

50|$|Commercialization or <b>marketization</b> (the {{terms are}} often used interchangeably in the <b>marketization</b> debate among scholars) occurs when a NPO decides to provide goods or {{services}} {{with the intent of}} turning a profit. Nonprofits’ resource dependency often lead them to constantly look for additional, nonconventional for nonprofit, funding. Factors behind a nonprofits decision to marketize are usually compounded by issues such as increased demand for services, inability to tax, and other funding sources’ inability to cover operational and service costs for the NPO. In return, the NPO enters into a mixed marketplace and thus begins to compete either with other NPO’s or for-profit entities.|$|E

With less government grants and resources being used for social services, contract competition between private and nonprofit sector has increased and led to nonprofit organizations using <b>marketization</b> techniques used mainly in the private sector to compete for resources to maintain their organizations livelihood. Scholars have argued that the <b>marketization</b> of the nonprofit sector will lead to a decrease of quality in services provided by nonprofit organizations.|$|E

Up until then, they had more frequently attacked anyone who criticised the rush to <b>marketization</b> as a 'conservative' - this is how Cui Zhiyuan was initially described, for example.

5000|$|The Double Movement is {{a concept}} {{originated}} by Karl Polanyi in his book The Great Transformation. The phrase refers to the dialectical process of <b>marketization</b> and push for social protection against that <b>marketization.</b> First, laissez-faire reformers seek to [...] "disembed" [...] the economy {{in order to establish}} what Polanyi calls a [...] "market society" [...] wherein all things are commodified, including what Polanyi terms [...] "false commodities": land, labor, and money. Second, a reactionary [...] "countermovement" [...] arises whereby society attempts to re-embed the economy through the creation of social protections such as labor laws and tariffs. In Polanyi's view, these liberal reformers seek to subordinate society to the market economy, which is taken by these reformers to be self-regulating. To Polanyi, this is a utopian project, as economies are always embedded in societies.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two main}} {{patterns}} of the liberalization process. The first one, acted in September 1987, concerns the <b>marketization</b> and removal of restrictions in the sector of agriculture. From that point, individuals are free to grow any type of crop and export their agricultural production. Those laws are significant {{in a country where}} 70% of the population is rural and its livelihoods are consequently mainly related to agriculture. However, the liberalization was not complete since the rice market had been excluded from the reforms, and only experienced <b>marketization</b> during a second liberalization in 2004. The second one is the Foreign Investment Law (FIL) of November 1988. This allows foreign capitals in a company from joint venture participation with a minimum of 35% of foreign holdings to a full detention with 100% of foreign equity. In order to attract foreign capitals, the law brings guarantees against the possibility of nationalization. It also ensures three years of tax exemption and the repatriation of profits.|$|E
