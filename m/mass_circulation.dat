His inaugural address, entitled The Penetrative Powers of the Price System, must have baffled his listeners as he ranged over centuries of economic history jumping abruptly from one topic to the next linking monetary developments to patterns of trade and settlement. The address was an ambitious attempt to show the disruptive effects of new technologies culminating in the modern shift from an industrial system based on coal and iron to the newest sources of industrial power, electricity, oil and steel. Innis also tried to show the commercial effects of <b>mass</b> <b>circulation</b> newspapers, made possible by expanded newsprint production, and of the new medium of radio, which [...] "threatens to circumvent the walls imposed by tariffs and to reach across boundaries frequently denied to other media of communication".

The general subsurface wave-speed structure {{is similar to the}} previous results obtained from SOHO/MDI observations. The general subsurface flow structure is also similar, and the downward flows beneath the sunspot and the <b>mass</b> <b>circulations</b> around the sunspot are clearly resolved. Below the sunspot, some organized divergent flow cells are observed, and these structures may indicate the existence of mesoscale convective motions. Near the light bridge inside the sunspot, hotter plasma is found beneath, and flows divergent from this area are observed. The Hinode data also allow us to investigate potential uncertainties caused by the use of phase-speed filter for short travel distances. Comparing the measurements with and without the phase-speed filtering, we find out that inside the sunspot, mean acoustic travel times are in basic agreement, but the values are underestimated by a factor of 20 - 40 % inside the sunspot umbra for measurements with the filtering. The initial acoustic tomography results from Hinode show a great potential of using high-resolution observations for probing the internal structure and dynamics of sunspots.

40|$|Abstract: A {{combined}} hydrogeological, geochemical nd isotopic {{investigation was}} performed in the Aveiro Cretaceous coastal aquifer in order to investigate he rock-water interaction {{and the evolution of}} palaeowaters. The results indicate an aquifer with well-defined freshwater (< 50 mg 1 - 1 C 1 -) throughout most of the aquifer as far as the coastline and with very slow chemical kinetics for the water-rock interactions. The low mineralization may be explained by the mainly siliciclastic omposition of the aquifer sediments, while calcite dissolution a d cation exchange were also considered {{to be involved in the}} groundwater chemical evolution. This interpretation is in agreement with lithology and facies changes, and was validated by the PHREEQC- 2 modelling results. Radiocarbon ages indicate asmooth gradient across the aquifer, implying continuous flow during the late Pleistocene and Holocene. Noble gas ratios indicate that the mean annual air temperatures were lower by 5 - 6 °C at the last glacial maximum (LGM). In contrast o most areas with continental palaeowaters, the environmental isotopes indicate enrichment (0. 8 - 1. 0 %o in 180), interpreted asreflecting the composition ofthe oceans at the time of the LGM at this maritime site, as well as the constancy of the air <b>mass</b> <b>circulations</b> over the period to the present day.

40|$|Having an {{extensive}} background in classical music performance and theory, as I began to explore architecture, I immediately noticed profound {{similarities between the}} two art forms. After additional research, I found that I was but one among many who had explored this relationship. What is most fascinating {{about the history of}} the long- standing interest in music and architecture is the richness of variation amongst the attitudes, inspirations, and discoveries that have come forth from within the union. This variation confirms the robustness of this concept as a source of inspiration not only for architects and music theorists, but also for cross-disciplinary thinkers. The goal of this thesis is two-fold. The first is to distill and illuminate the most powerful aspects of the relationships between music and architecture. The findings are presented in sections I, Background Research and II, Case Studies. Section I contains a survey of a variety of points of contact between music and architecture. Section II explores how these points of contact have been manifested in precedent works by architects and in personal experiments. The second goal of this thesis is to synthesize the above information and enact it upon an architectural design, as presented in sections III, Existing Site 2 ̆ 6 Program and IV, Design.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that orbital scale sea-level changes generated larger transport of sediments into the deep-sea during the last glacial maximum than the Holocene. However, the response of sedimentary processes to abrupt millennial-scale climate variability is rather unknown. Frequency of distal turbidites and amounts of advected detrital carbonate are estimated off the Lisbon-Setúbal canyons, within a chronostratigraphy based on radiometric ages, oxygen isotopes and paleomagnetic key global anomalies. We found that: 1) Higher frequency of turbidites concurred with Northern Hemisphere coldest temperatures (Greenland Stadials [GS], including Heinrich [H] events). But more than that, an escalating frequency of turbidites starts {{with the onset of}} global sea-level rising (and warming in Antarctica) and culminates during H events, at the time when rising is still in its early-mid stage, and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is re-starting. This short time span coincides with maximum gradients of ocean surface and bottom temperatures between GS and Antarctic warmings (Antarctic Isotope Maximum; AIM 17, 14, 12, 8, 4, 2) and rapid sea-level rises. 2) Trigger of turbidity currents is not the only sedimentary process responding to millennial variability; land-detrital carbonate (with a very negative bulk d 18 O signature) enters the deep-sea by density-driven slope lateral advection, accordingly during GS. 3) Possible mechanisms to create slope instability on the Portuguese continental margin are sea-level variations as small as 20 m, and slope friction by rapid deep and intermediate re-accommodation of water <b>masses</b> <b>circulation.</b> 4) Common forcing mechanisms appear to drive slope instability at both millennial and orbital scales...|$|R
