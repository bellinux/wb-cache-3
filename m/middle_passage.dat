Because of the legal dispute, reports of the massacre received increased publicity, stimulating the abolitionist movement in the late 18th and early 19th centuries; the Zong events were increasingly cited as a powerful symbol of the horrors of the <b>Middle</b> <b>Passage</b> of slaves to the New World.|$|E
5|$|In May 1803 a shipload of captive West Africans, upon {{surviving}} the <b>middle</b> <b>passage,</b> were landed by U.S.-paid captors in Savannah by slave ship, to be auctioned off {{at one of}} the local slave markets. The ship's enslaved passengers included a number of Igbo people from what is now Nigeria. The Igbo were known by planters and slavers of the American South for being fiercely independent and resistant to chattel slavery. The group of 75 Igbo slaves were bought by agents of John Couper and Thomas Spalding for forced labor on their plantations in St. Simons Island for $100 each.|$|E
5|$|The British {{initially}} {{became involved}} in the slave trade during the 16th century. By 1783, the triangular route that took British-made goods to Africa to buy slaves, transported the enslaved to the West Indies, and then brought slave-grown products such as sugar, tobacco, and cotton to Britain, represented about 80percent of Great Britain's foreign income. British ships dominated the trade, supplying French, Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese and British colonies, and in peak years carried forty thousand enslaved men, women and children across the Atlantic in the horrific conditions of the <b>middle</b> <b>passage.</b> Of the estimated 11million Africans transported into slavery, about 1.4million died during the voyage.|$|E

5|$|Two years later, the Royal African Company was inaugurated, {{receiving}} from King Charles {{a monopoly}} {{of the trade}} to supply slaves to the British colonies of the Caribbean. From the outset, slavery was {{the basis of the}} British Empire in the West Indies. Until the abolition of its slave trade in 1807, Britain was responsible for the transportation of 3.5 million African slaves to the Americas, a third of all slaves transported across the Atlantic. To facilitate this trade, forts were established on the coast of West Africa, such as James Island, Accra and Bunce Island. In the British Caribbean, the percentage of the population of African descent rose from 25% in 1650 to around 80% in 1780, and in the Thirteen Colonies from 10% to 40% over the same period (the majority in the southern colonies). For the slave traders, the trade was extremely profitable, and became a major economic mainstay for such western British cities as Bristol and Liverpool, which formed the third corner of the triangular trade with Africa and the Americas. For the transported, harsh and unhygienic conditions on the slaving ships and poor diets meant that the average mortality rate during the <b>Middle</b> <b>Passage</b> was one in seven.|$|E
5|$|With the {{publication}} of the Privy Council report in April 1789 and following months of planning, Wilberforce commenced his parliamentary campaign. On 12 May 1789, he made his first major speech on the subject of abolition in the House of Commons, in which he reasoned that the trade was morally reprehensible and an issue of natural justice. Drawing on Thomas Clarkson's mass of evidence, he described in detail the appalling conditions in which slaves travelled from Africa in the <b>middle</b> <b>passage,</b> and argued that abolishing the trade would also bring an improvement to the conditions of existing slaves in the West Indies. He moved 12 resolutions condemning the slave trade, but made no reference to the abolition of slavery itself, instead dwelling on the potential for reproduction in the existing slave population should the trade be abolished. With the tide running against them, the opponents of abolition delayed the vote by proposing that the House of Commons hear its own evidence, and Wilberforce, in a move that has subsequently been criticised for prolonging the slave trade, reluctantly agreed. The hearings were not completed {{by the end of the}} parliamentary session, and were deferred until the following year. In the meantime, Wilberforce and Clarkson tried unsuccessfully to take advantage of the egalitarian atmosphere of the French Revolution to press for France's abolition of the trade, which was, in any event, to be abolished in 1794 as a result of the bloody slave revolt in St. Domingue (later to be known as Haiti), although later briefly restored by Napoleon in 1802.|$|E

25|$|Estimates by Patrick Manning {{are that}} about 12 million slaves entered the Atlantic {{trade between the}} 16th and 19th century, but about 1.5 million died on board ship. About 10.5 million slaves arrived in the Americas.

25|$|The Atlantic {{slave trade}} or transatlantic slave trade {{involved}} the transportation by slave traders of enslaved African people, mainly from Africa to the Americas, {{and then their}} sale there. The slave trade used mainly the triangular trade route and its <b>Middle</b> <b>Passage,</b> and existed from the 16th to the 19th centuries. The vast majority {{of those who were}} enslaved and transported in the transatlantic slave trade were Africans from central and western Africa, who had been sold by other West Africans to Western European slave traders (with a small number being captured directly by the slave traders in coastal raids), who brought them to the Americas. The South Atlantic and Caribbean economies especially were dependent on the supply of secure labour for the production of commodity crops, making goods and clothing to sell in Europe. This was crucial to those western European countries which, in the late 17th and 18th centuries, were vying with each other to create overseas empires.|$|E
40|$|Introduction & Objective: Stem {{cells are}} {{determined}} by their unique features. One of them is high proliferation ability {{and the other is}} potency of differentiation to various tissues. The results of new works in various countries around the world including Iran show the growing momentum of works on stem cell therapy. Working with stem cells from different origins including the cells originated from fetal and adult origin (such as bone marrow, dental root, cord, etc) is in progress. The goal of this work was to clear the maintenance and stability of genetic materials of human mesenchymal stem cells through consecutive subcultures in our lab conditions in Hamadan Uni-versity of Medical Sciences. Materials & Methods: In an experimental work, human umbilical cord was used as a rich source of stem cells. Isolated stem cells, after proliferation phase, increased and filled the bottom of the flasks in consecutive passages. After some successive consecutive subcultures, stem cells aged and this may cause damages to genetic material that is evaluated in primary passages (passages number 1 - 5), <b>middle</b> <b>passages</b> (passages number 8 - 12) and late passages (passages number 15 - 18) by the single cell gel electrophoresis assay (comet assay). Also their karyotypes were ex-amined; Solid technique and G-banding staining for chromosome analysis in the stem cells were employed. Several microscopic slides from each passage were prepared. Then 20 cells were ran-domly selected from the slides related to each group. In all selected cells, damages were exam-ined and their degree of damages were scored based on the standard patterns, from 0 to 4. The averages were compared by Kruskal–Wallis test in different groups. Results: Average scores related to three studied cell groups, primary, <b>middle</b> and late <b>passages,</b> were 0. 4, 2. 8 and 3. 6, respectively. Prepared karyotypes from the cells belonging to passages 1 - 5 were normal but in the aged passages they were abnormal numerically and structurally. Our re-sults showed that the aging phenomenon and its consequences such as DNA damages should be considered in the work with consecutive passages of stem cells. Conclusion : We concluded that in our laboratory conditions, the stem cells taken from human umbilical cord blood are only usable for research purposes in early passages (below passage five). We recommend using passages more than five only for educational purposes in our labora-tory; and it is better to do the same work in such research centers.
