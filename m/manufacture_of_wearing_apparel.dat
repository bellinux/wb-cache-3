50|$|The Jews of Baltimore {{have participated}} {{fully in the}} civic life {{of the town and}} the state, and have taken some part in {{national}} affairs. In the city, Jews have filled numerous minor offices, notably as councilmen, justices of the peace, supervisors of elections, and in the city law department, as well as on boards and special commissions. Myer Block was judge of the Orphans' Court in Baltimore; Jacob H. Hollander was secretary to the International Bimetallic Commission, and the first treasurer of Porto Rico under American jurisdiction. Isidor Rayner served as representative in the fiftieth, the fifty-second, and the fifty-third congresses, after having sat in the House of Delegates and the Senate of the state; later he was attorney-general of the state. Among the state senators have been Jacob M. Moses and Lewis Putzel; and among the delegates: Mendes I. Cohen, Martin Emerich, Harry A. Fuld, M. S. Hess, Emanuel H. Jacobi, Martin Lehmayer, Lewis Putzel, and Charles J. Wiener. In the business world the Jews of Baltimore have occupied an important position. To a great extent they controlled the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>apparel</b> for men. Several of the largest department stores were conducted by Jews; and as financiers they bore an enviable reputation for probity and for a spirit of far-sighted and cautious enterprise.|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} {{focuses on}} the iron and steel industry, the motor vehicle and the non-electrical machinery industry {{as well as the}} <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>apparel</b> and footwear. The iron and steel industry and the motor vehicle industry were chosen, because they are characterized by low to middle skill level, capital-intensive production processes (Wolter 1974, 66 - 67; Walter 1982, 1; Humphrey 1982, 101; Kageyama, 1984, 25). The non-electrical machinery industry was selected, because it depends traditionally more on skilled labor, and less on physical capital (Dick 1981, 30; UNIDO 1984, 5 and 60). Finally the wearing apparel and the footwear industries represent the case of labor-intensive production processes that draw mainly on unskilled labor (Pearson 1983, 65; ILO 1979, 30). Throughout the analysis all manufacturing is used as a common benchmark. Reference is made to major competing newly industrialized countries, i. e., South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Mexico, as well as to industrialized countries such as the United States, Spain, Japan, and the Federal Republic of Germany. Section II will clarify the most important conceptual and methodological issues and some shortcomings of previous labor cost analyses, and lay the ground for the empirical investigation pursued in this study. Partial findings of previous studies on Brazilian labor costs will be referred to as complementary information in the empirical part of the study (Section III). In Section IV the major results of the analysis will be summarized. ...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{this article}} is to examine the stage of textile recycle waste in Romania.

40|$|Unprecedented {{economic}} {{achievement in}} China’s textile industry (TI) has occurred along with rising water consumption. The goal of industrial sustainable development requires the decoupling {{of economic growth}} from resource consumption. This paper examines the relationship between water consumption and economic growth, and the internal influence mechanism of China’s TI and its three sub-sectors: the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> textiles (MT) sector, the <b>Manufacture</b> <b>of</b> Textile <b>Wearing</b> <b>Apparel,</b> Footwear, and Caps (MTWA) sector, and the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> chemical fibers (MCF) sector. A decoupling analysis was performed and the Laspeyres decomposition method {{was applied to the}} period from 2001 to 2014. We showed that six of the fourteen years analyzed (2003, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2013) exhibited a strong decoupling effect and three of the fourteen years (2005, 2007, and 2010) exhibited a weak decoupling effect. Overall, China’s TI experienced a good decoupling between economic growth and water consumption from 2002 to 2014. For the three sub-sectors, the MTWA sector experienced a more significant positive decoupling than the MT and MCF sectors. The decomposition results confirm that the industrial scale factor is the most important driving force of China’s TI water consumption increase, while the water efficiency factor is the most important inhibiting force. The industrial structure adjustment does not significantly affect water consumption. The industrial scale and water use efficiency factors are also the main determinants of change in water consumption for the three sub-sectors...|$|R

Economic development can be focused on regional economic development, because it {{will contribute to the}} development of the province and will also contribute to national development. Establishment of Forum for Economic Development and Employment Promotion (FEDEP) by the City Government of Semarang in 2008, is the role of Semarang City Government in formulating policies for industrial development and small and focused and sustained. Development of Small and Medium Industries (IKM) will be more effective if supported by the existence of small-scale businesses, medium enterprises. IKM also requires the container to maintain its existence and develop themselves. One of the tasks is to develop IKM FEDEP through cluster approach, it also as a step to give more value to the IKM be able to compete in the free market. The analytical method used is the Location Quotient index, Herfindahl index, and bilateral Krugman specialization index and the Ellison-Glaeser index in explaining specialization and spatial concentration of small and medium industries in the city of Semarang in years 1999 to 2006 analysis. The result of the analysis are based on district, Semarang IKM concentrated in Sub Genuk (26, 21 %), and Gayamsari (12, 77 %). IKM seed subsector based on the specialization of Semarang district level are the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> food, beverages and tobacco (ISIC 3. 1) (25, 81 %), <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> textiles, <b>wearing</b> <b>apparel</b> and leather (ISIC 3. 2) (20, 46 %), and the timber subsector and the like (ISIC 3. 3) (18, 36 %). There are also several areas of concentration in Semarang IKM among Sub Genuk (ISIC 3. 3), where the area of concentration is a concern because of agglomeration effect, and the District of Gayamsari (ISIC 3. 9). In addition there are also several areas of concentration that is potential to develop IKM is District of Semarang Selatan, Gajah Mungkur, Candisari, and Tembalang (ISIC 3. 4) ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The paper aims {{to devote}} {{itself to the}} researching {{of the changes in}} firm {{efficiency}} in consumer goods industry under the political changes and tightening of competition. This study has for an objective the estimation of the consequences of changes in policy on firm efficiency and the development the ways of improving of the efficiency of both separate firms and the whole industries. Design/methodology/approach – The industrial efficiency is measured by data envelopment analysis (DEA). The change of efficiency by reason of political events during 2004 / 2005 is evaluated by the Malmquist total factor productivity index. Some firm attributes are examined for their impact on efficiency. They are firm size, regional location and property category. The results are based on a sample of 336 Ukrainian firms of consumer goods industry. Findings – Sharp socio-oriented reforms that promoted the rise of public welfare, led to many negative economic trends. But the impact of political changes on industrial efficiency was multivalued. The political changes had positive influence on efficiency of beverages and food industry and negative on light industry efficiency. The <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> food, textiles, <b>wearing</b> <b>apparel</b> and leather products is among the lowest efficient industrial activities in Ukraine and need to be improved. The empirical results reveal the influence of firm size, regional location and property category on firm efficiency. Research limitations/implications – The research is limited by three main consumer goods industries and by relatively short data set. The former explains that they are the most socio-oriented industries and kindle researcher interest under the changes of socio-economic policy. To the latter belong high requirements to the data and necessity to avoid the data errors in DEA. Therefore the input-output data, reliability of those are proved by the audit reports, are considered here. Practical implications – The paper examines the impact of sharp political changes on industrial efficiency. Through the results of the analysis the recommendations for the decision making for the purpose of efficiency-improving in the consumer goods industry of Ukraine were formulated. Originality/value – This is the first paper that adopts DEA for measuring of efficiency in consumer goods industries of Ukraine under political changes.
