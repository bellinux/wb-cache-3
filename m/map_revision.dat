40|$|Abstract. Ontology {{matching}} {{is one of}} the key research {{topics in}} the field of the Semantic Web. There are many matching systems that generate mappings between different ontologies either automatically or semiautomatically. However, the mappings generated by these systems may be inconsistent with the ontologies. Several approaches have been proposed to deal with the inconsistencies between mappings and ontologies. This problem is often called a <b>mapping</b> <b>revision</b> problem because we give priority to ontologies when resolving inconsistencies. In this paper, we first propose a conflict-based <b>mapping</b> <b>revision</b> operator and show that it can be characterized by a logical postulate. We then provide an iterative algorithm for <b>mapping</b> <b>revision</b> by using an ontology revision operator and show that this algorithm defines a conflict-based <b>mapping</b> <b>revision</b> operator. Three concrete ontology revision operators are given to instantiate the iterative algorithm, which result in three different <b>mapping</b> <b>revision</b> algorithms. We implement these algorithms and provide some preliminary but interesting evaluation results. ...|$|R

Each dimension of the 8 C was mapped into a set of quantitative website elements, selected websites were scraped to get the quantitative website elements, and the score of each dimension was calculated. A software was developed in PHP for the experiments. In the training process, 10 experiments were conducted and quantitative analysis was regressively conducted between the experiments. The conversion rate was used to verify the heuristic evaluation of an e-commerce website after each experiment. The {{results showed that the}} <b>mapping</b> <b>revisions</b> between the experiments improved the performance of the evaluation instrument, therefore the experiment process and the quantitative <b>mapping</b> <b>revision</b> guideline proposed was on the right track.

40|$|Abstract. Revision of a {{description}} logic-based ontology {{deals with the}} problem of incorporating newly received information consistently. In this paper, we propose a general operator for revising terminologies in description logic-based ontologies. Our revision operator relies on a reformulation of the kernel contraction operator in belief revision. We first define our revision operator for terminologies and show that it satisfies some desirable logical properties. Second, two algorithms are developed to instantiate the revision operator. Since in general, these two algorithms are computationally too hard, we propose a third algorithm as a more efficient alternative. We implemented the algorithms and provide evaluation results on their efficiency, effectiveness and meaningfulness in the context of two application scenarios: Incremental ontology learning and <b>mapping</b> <b>revision.</b> ...|$|R

Consequently semi-automatic road tracking has become the preferred solution. In this paper we introduce a road tracking system based on particle filtering and human-computer interactions.

During the estimation and human-computer interaction, new reference profiles were generated and stored in the road template memory for future correlation analysis, thus covering the space of road profiles. Human input provided the road tracker with initial estimates, updated state parameters and multiple reference profiles. This approach has resulted in remarkable improvements in efficiency, compared to the human-only approach while preserving robustness and accuracy. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{every part}} of the world the rate of <b>map</b> <b>revision</b> is alarmingly low, when {{compared}} to the rate of change of many human influenced surface features. Map making is very time-consuming and often information used for updates has become history before the updated map is made available. There is therefore a requirement to regularly gather up-to-date information about surface features and to incorporate changes in maps both quickly and efficiently. Automation of two systems, i. e. the automation of map-image registration and then of change detection can fulfill the requirements of <b>map</b> <b>revision.</b> This thesis works on the first system. The piece of work in this study has looked into a fast and an accurate solution to register high resolution satellite images to maps. This will allow changes in ground features to be used to update maps. Photogrammetric techniques used to update maps have previously shown good results, but they are tedious, time-consuming, and not beneficial for updating small changes at all. Feature extraction methods were used in the present study. The system developed was designed for automatic extraction of suitable areal features in images. The emphasis was on areal features rather than point or linear features because they have a distinctive shape, and they are extracted easily from vector as well as raster data. The extraction of suitable polygons, as control information, from images was obtained by using two matching techniques. Patch matching to extract the conjugate map and image polygons, and dynamic programming to find the corresponding matched boundary pixels of the map and image polygons. Some matched points were incorrect because of perspective, shadows and occlusions. A statistical model was developed to remove perspective distortion and large errors. The model demonstrated the removal of erroneous match points, and selected the good match points and registered the images to maps with a sub-pixel accuracy. A novel aspect of the study is that the automation is achieved with high accuracy in flat and moderate terrain areas without using height information, as it is essentially used in photogrammetric techniques...|$|E
