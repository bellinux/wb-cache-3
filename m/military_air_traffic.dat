5|$|In {{the wake}} of the two airliners lost in the April and May 1958 collisions, {{investigators}} from a House of Representatives committeeconcerned about the lack of coordination between civil and <b>military</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controllersimposed a 60-day deadline on the CAB and the Air Force to establish new control procedures. The committee also said that eventually a single civil agency should be given the power to regulate all air space for all types of aircraft. Furthermore, the committee stated that military flying should be controlled in the vicinity of airways not only in instrument weather, but also in visual conditions.|$|E
5|$|No. 11 Group was {{relocated}} to RAF Martlesham Heath in 1958, when control of RAF Hillingdon passed from Fighter Command to RAF Technical Training Command {{and the entire}} site became known as RAF Uxbridge. The RAF School of Education moved into Hillingdon House from RAF Spitalgate on 10 November. Southern Region Air Traffic Services HQ and the Royal Observer Corps' South East Communications Centre moved into the house in 1960. On 1 November, the Southern Region Air Traffic Services headquarters moved into Hillingdon House. The station had been home {{since the end of}} the war to the London Area Control Centre, renamed the London Air Traffic Control Centre in 1948 and the Uxbridge Air Traffic Control Centre in 1957. This eventually transferred to RAF West Drayton, which operated as a satellite station of RAF Uxbridge. HQ <b>Military</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> Operations (HQ MATO) moved into Hillingdon House in January 1965.|$|E
5|$|In August 1996, a Spanish Learjet {{operated}} by Mar Aviation overshot runway 25 and {{collided with a}} van heading eastward on the A40 Western Avenue; the aircraft was carrying an actress bound for Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire. The two pilots, the actress and van driver all suffered minor injuries. The ensuing investigation by the Civil Aviation Authority's Air Accidents Investigation Branch found that both the crew's lack of understanding English and <b>military</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control procedures had {{contributed significantly to the}} crash. Subsequently, after some thirty years of protracted consideration, an ILS was eventually fitted to Northolt's redefined Runway 25. In addition, aggregate-filled safety pits were installed {{at each end of the}} runway by 21 January 1998 to protect road users in the event of another business jet or military transport failing to stop or ascend before the end of the runway. The House of Commons Transport Select Committee considered the conversion of RAF Northolt to a possible offshoot of Heathrow Airport in the 1990s. While the existing runways would cause aircraft to cross the flightpaths of those using Heathrow, new parallel runways were suggested. These suggestions were opposed by then MP for Ruislip-Northwood, John Wilkinson, and eventually progressed no further.|$|E

25|$|RAF West Drayton was a non-flying Royal Air Force {{station in}} West Drayton, within the London Borough of Hillingdon, {{which served as}} the main centre for <b>military</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control in the United Kingdom. It was {{co-located}} with the civilian London Terminal Control Centre to provide a vital link between civil and military flying and airspace requirements. Following {{the departure of the}} remaining civil and <b>military</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control systems by 2008, the site was closed and demolished for a new residential development.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigation}} {{concluded that}} the flight operations director at Zavitinsk air base did not use radar assistance to track the Tupolevs, which became the direct cause of the accident. Additionally, there was a poor coordination between the local civilian and <b>military</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control due to flawed air traffic regulations.

25|$|Earlier on 2 June 1994, the {{helicopter}} and crew had {{carried out a}} trooping flight, as it {{was considered to be}} unsafe for British troops to move around in certain parts of Northern Ireland using surface transport at the time due to the threat posed by Provisional IRA attacks. This mission was safely accomplished and they returned to Aldergrove at 15:20. They took off for Inverness at 17:42. Weather en route was forecast to be clear except in the Mull of Kintyre area.

25|$|The use of <b>military</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> {{controllers}} {{for civilian}} traffic is not unusual, {{but has been}} deprecated in most developed countries. In the US, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) operates a wholly parallel system {{with that of the}} US Air Force and NORAD. This is also the case of Eurocontrol and each of its member nations' air defense systems. Brazil's use of an integrated command poses some unique challenges to the government. As members of the military, controllers are not allowed to form unions (such as the case of NATCA in the US) or to strike.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Air Force withdrew in 1994, {{at which}} point the English Electric Lightning acting as a gate {{guardian}} was scrapped; only the nose section was retained and sent to the Malta Aviation Museum. Air traffic control services remained, although the section responsible for airspace outside London moved to Swanwick in Hampshire in 2002. The remaining operation was named the London Terminal Control Centre. RAF personnel remained on the site, as <b>military</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control functions for the eastern side of England remained. In November 2007, the remaining civil air traffic control services moved to Swanwick, and in January 2008 the military operation also left the site. National Air Traffic Services vacated the site in 2008. The MT section of the Queen's Colour Squadron relocated to RAF Northolt.|$|E

2500|$|The {{amount of}} {{information}} the United States government {{has been willing to}} provide regarding Area 51 has generally been minimal. The area surrounding the lake is permanently off-limits to both civilian and normal <b>military</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic.</b> Security clearances are checked regularly; cameras and weaponry are not allowed. Even military pilots training in the NAFR risk disciplinary action if they stray into the exclusionary [...] "box" [...] surrounding Groom's airspace. Surveillance is supplemented using buried motion sensors. Area 51 is a common destination for Janet, the de facto name of a small fleet of passenger aircraft operated on behalf of the United States Air Force to transport military personnel, primarily from McCarran International Airport.|$|E
2500|$|During the Cold War era (1945–1991), the West Berlin air {{corridors}}, {{also known}} as the Berlin corridors and control zone, were three regulated airways for civil and <b>military</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> of the Western Allies between West Berlin and West Germany passing over East Germany's territory. The corridors and control zone were physically centered on and under control of the all-Allied Berlin Air Safety Center (BASC) in West Berlin. The airspace within these corridors was used by US, UK and French-registered non-combat aircraft belonging to these countries' armed forces and airlines operated by pilots holding those countries' passports. In addition, it was also used by LOT Polish Airlines for regular scheduled services from Warsaw to London and Paris via Schönefeld Airport to the [...] south of East Berlin.|$|E
2500|$|Breaching of the 24th {{meridian}} {{policy by}} military aircraft during exercises would be {{discovered by the}} control and reporting centers, which would order the aircraft to turn back.

During an exercise three years later on 13 March 1985, two Sea Harriers from HMS Invincible, then anchored off Andøya, were recorded as being [...] inside the no-fly zone, comparatively close to the 1982 site of Invincible. This was the only incident that the parliamentary commission was able to verify. The commission's members carried out interviews with dozens of civilian and <b>military</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controllers, pilots and boat skippers; none had ever observed foreign aircraft in the no-fly zone, although all had heard rumors of such activity. The commission concluded that alleged frequent breaches of the zone {{were the result of}} an urban legend.|$|E
