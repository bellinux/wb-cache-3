40|$|Background: Community-acquired {{pneumonia}} {{in adults}} {{is a serious}} health problem in the ambulatory care setting. Aim: To define clinical variables associated {{with the presence of}} pneumonia in adult patients presenting with fever or respiratory symptoms to the emergency department. Material and methods: Prospective study carried out in the emergency department from the Catholic University Hospital in Santiago, Chile. Three hundred twenty-five patients (53 ± 22 years) presenting fever or acute respiratory symptoms were included. After obtaining a clinical history and physical examination, the physician established a tentative diagnosis. Subsequently, a definitive diagnosis was made with the chest X rays. Results: Thirty-four percent of the patients had pneumonia. The clinical diagnosis of pneumonia before X-ray examination was variable among emergency physicians (positive likelihood ratio: 1. 5 - 4. 8) and showed only moderate sensitivity (79 %) and specificity (66 %). The clinical variables significantly associated with the presence of pneumonia were: advanced age (over 75 years), cardiovascular disease, fever, chills, sputum production, orthopnea, altered <b>mental</b> status, cyanosis, <b>dullness</b> on percussion, bronchial breath sounds, crackles, any abnormal vital sign (heart rate ³ 100 beats/min, respiratory rate ³ 20 breaths/min or temperature ³ 38 °C) and oxygen saturation below 90 % breathing air. Conclusions: Clinical judgment prior to observation of chest X rays had moderate sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of pneumonia. There were no individual clinical findings, or combination of findings, that could confirm or exclude the diagnosis of pneumonia for a patient suspected of having this illne...|$|R

40|$|Pituitary macroadenomas are {{becoming}} more prevalent in veterinary medicine. This paper discusses a 10 year old female, spayed Beagle that presented to the Cornell Hospital for Animals with the chief complaints of <b>mental</b> <b>dullness,</b> pacing, staring at walls, polyuria, and polydyspia. The past history included a great appetite, increased drinking and urination habits and progressive lethargy. On physical examination the only abnormalities noted were a previously diagnosed heart murmur, left hind limb lameness due to previous cranial cruciate rupture and subsequent surgical repair, <b>mental</b> <b>dullness,</b> pot-belly appearance and pain on palpation {{of the head and}} neck. Initial diagnostics pursued were a complete blood count, chemistry panel, urinanalysis, endogenous ACTH test and low dose dexemethasone suppression test. The results of these initial diagnostics gave the presumptive diagnosis of pituitary dependent hyperadrenocorticism. Due to the neurological signs on presentation, and head and neck pain elicited, an MRI scan was also performed. This revealed a 14 x 17 x 20 mm mass in the region of the pituitary gland. Final diagnosis was of a pituitary macroadenoma. Radiation therapy was employed to treat the pituitary macroadenoma. The treatment was successful with a reduction of the neurological signs. Medical management was used to control the signs of hyperadrenocorticism. Discussion of this case as related to pituitary dependent hyperadrenocorticism and specifically pituitary macroadenomas is outlined below...|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} an unusual manifestation of congenital hypothyroidism in a kitten presented for an ileocolic intussusception and chronic constipation. A ten-week-old, undersized, entire male mixed-breed kitten presented for abdominal pain and distension. Radiography and abdominal ultrasound confirmed a small intestinal intussusception. Following successful surgical {{reduction of the}} intussusception, the kitten continued to suffer from chronic constipation that was nonresponsive to medical management.

40|$|The {{neurotoxic}} {{effects of}} levamisole therapy have been rarely reported. In this article, we report two patients who developed multifocal demyelinating leukoencephalopathy (MDL) after levamisole treatment. Clinically, they had dizziness, nausea, vomiting, confu-sion, <b>mental</b> <b>dullness,</b> speechlessness, and memory impairment after the treatment. The total dosage of levamisole was 300 mg and 1800 mg, respectively. The onset of symptoms was acute or subacute, {{from a few}} hours to several weeks. Initial brain magnetic resonance imag-ing (MRI) demonstrated diffuse multifocal enhancing lesions in the subcortical white matter. After the withdrawal of levamisole, and during the follow-up period, the neurological and neuropsychological manifestations and serial brain MRI improved gradually. We conclude that levamisole treatment may induce MDL, and that the brain MRI changes may correlate well with the recovery of clinical features and neuropsychological findings. In addition, early steroid treatment is crucial, and the neurotoxic effect of levamisole is not dose-depen-dent and may be idiosyncratic or immune-mediated.

40|$|Authors {{almost always}} refer to {{hypothyroidism}} {{as a common}} (if not the most common) endocrine disease in dogs, I {{but there is little}} evidence to support this claim. In fact, canine hypothyroidism {{may be one of the}} most over-diagnosed diseases in small animal medicine. Just about any medical disorder can be associated with decreases in circulating concentrations of thyroid hormone, causing hypothyroidism to be over-diagnosed. In addition, it is common practice for veterinarians to treat hypothyroidism empirically following a presumptive diagnosis. This practice is not recommended for several reasons. First of all, it is not scientificly sound medical practice. Secondly, it may allow another disorder to progress undiagnosed.

40|$|The disease {{phenotype}} of bovine {{spongiform encephalopathy}} (BSE) and the molecular / biological properties of its prion strain, including the host range and the characteristics of BSE-related disorders, have been extensively studied since its discovery in 1986. In recent years, systematic testing of the brains of cattle coming to slaughter resulted {{in the identification of}} at least two atypical forms of BSE. These emerging disorders are characterized by novel conformers of the bovine pathological prion protein (PrP TSE), named high-type (BSE-H) and low-type (BSE-L). We recently reported two Italian atypical cases with a PrP TSE type identical to BSE-L, pathologically characterized by PrP amyloid plaques and known as bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy (BASE). Several lines of evidence suggest that BASE is highly virulent and easily transmissible to a wide host range. Experimental transmission to transgenic mice overexpressing bovine PrP (Tgbov XV) suggested that BASE is caused by a prion strain distinct from the BSE isolate. In the present study, we experimentally infected Friesian and Alpine brown cattle with Italian BSE and BASE isolates via the intracerebral route. BASE-infected cattle developed amyotrophic changes accompanied by <b>mental</b> <b>dullness.</b> The molecular and neuropathological profiles, including PrP deposition pattern, closely matched those observed in the original cases.

40|$|Case summary A 6 -year-old, {{neutered}} female British Shorthair cat {{presented with}} acute-onset weakness and <b>mental</b> <b>dullness.</b> Initially {{the cat was}} mildly hyperglycaemic (9. 9 mmol/l; reference interval [RI] 3. 3 – 6. 7 mmol/l). Over the following 12 h the cat developed central blindness, tremors, intermittent seizures and opisthotonus. Repeat blood sampling revealed a marked hypoglycaemia (0. 8 mmol/l). Insulin level (performed on a serum sample collected while the cat was hypoglycaemic) was inappropriately elevated (1575 mIU/l; RI 10 – 80 mIU/l). An abdominal ultrasound was unremarkable. An exploratory laparotomy revealed a firm and erythematous left limb of the pancreas. Following surgical resection of the left limb of the pancreas, the cat returned to a euglycaemic state after a brief rebound hyperglycaemia. Histopathology revealed pancreatic fibrosis with marked multifocal micronodular hyperplasia of exocrine and endocrine cells. Synaptophysin immunohistochemistry confirmed nodular β-cell hyperplasia. Relevance and novel information Nesidioblastosis describes a syndrome of acquired hyperinsulinaemia and associated hypoglycaemia secondary to focal or diffuse (non-neoplastic) β-cell hyperplasia within the pancreas. Acquired nesidioblastosis {{has been reported in}} humans, where β-cell dysregulation is thought to occur in response to pancreatic injury. This is the first reported case of clinically significant hypoglycaemia due to acquired nesidioblastosis in an adult domestic cat. While this condition is rare, nesidioblastosis is being increasingly recognised in humans and it is an important differential diagnosis to consider when investigating hypoglycaemia as it cannot be distinguished from insulinoma without histopathological evaluation. While recurrence has been occasionally reported in humans, the prognosis is considered good...|$|E
40|$|Case summary Primary goitrous {{hypothyroidism}} {{was diagnosed}} in a 12 -month-old cat examined because of small stature, <b>mental</b> <b>dullness,</b> severe lethargy, generalized weakness and gait abnormalities. Radiographs {{of the long}} bones and spine revealed delayed epiphyseal ossification and epiphyseal dysgenesis. Diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism was confirmed by low serum concentrations of total and free thyroxine (T 4) with high thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations. Thyroid scintigraphy revealed severe enlargement of both thyroid lobes, as evidenced by a seven-fold increase in calculated thyroid volume above the reference interval. In addition, this bilateral goiter had an extremely high radionuclide uptake, about 10 -fold higher than the normal feline thyroid gland. Treatment with twice-daily levothyroxine (L-T 4), administered on an empty stomach, resulted in increased alertness, playfulness, strength and improvement in gait, {{as well as an}} increase in body length and weight. L-T 4 replacement also led to normalization of serum thyroid hormone and TSH concentrations, and complete resolution of goiter. Relevance and novel information Spontaneous hypothyroidism is rarely reported in cats, with congenital hypothyroidism in kittens diagnosed most frequently. Despite the fact that this cat was a young adult, it likely had a form of congenital hypothyroidism caused by dyshormonogenesis (defect in thyroid hormone synthesis) that led to compensatory development of goiter. In hypothyroid cats, treatment with L-T 4 is best given twice daily on an empty stomach to ensure adequate absorption. Normalization of serum TSH and shrinkage of goiter, as well as improvement in clinical signs, is the goal of treatment for cats with goitrous hypothyroidism...|$|E
40|$|In trearment of pineal tumors, {{radiotherapy}} with a {{shunting operation}} has been generally adopted because germinomas {{were the most}} common of pineal tumors, and also because radical resection of these tumors has resulted in high mortality and morbidity. However, about 10 % of the tumors in the pineal region are mixed germ cell tumors, and a combination of shunting operation and irradiation is limited in its effect on this kind of lesion. The authors have recently operated with good results on these recurrent tumors and the residual tumor by infratentorial supracerebellar approach in the concorde position. So, these cases were presented and the treatment for pineal tumor was discussed. Case 1 : A 15 -year-old boy was admitted with increased intracranial pressure (IICP) on May, 1979. Computerized tomography (CT) scans at that time showed pineal and suprasellar tumors with ventricular dissemination. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt followed by radiation therapy was peerformed. The tumors seemed to have almost disappeared after this therapy and the patient continued well until he complained of severe headache and general fatigue in September, 1984. CT scans showed a reccurrent tumor with cystic component. He was operated for the subtotal removal of the tumor on November 26, 1984 and was discharged with slight <b>mental</b> <b>dullness</b> two months postperatively. Histological diagnosis of the specimen was mature teratoma. Case 2 : A 10 -year-old boy was admitted with IICP and in a drowsy state on October 1, 1984. CT scans showed a pineal tumor with hydrocephalus. A combination of radiation and a shunting operation was performed. CT scans after this therapy showed a residual tumor but with tumor shrinkage. He was operated for the radical removal of the tumor. The Postoperative course was uneventful and he was discharged with Prinaud's sign on month after operation. Histological diagnosis of the specimen was teratoid. Case 3 : A 13 -year-old boy was admitted with IICP and diolopia on March 14, 1986. CT scans showed a pineal tumor with hydrocephalus.
