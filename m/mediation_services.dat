40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the Probation and <b>Mediation</b> <b>Service</b> in the Czech Republic, its {{importance}} and awareness of this service in society. The Probation and <b>Mediation</b> <b>Service</b> is a state organization that works {{in the field of}} criminal policy. Its main goal is to resolve the conflicts associated with criminal activities effectively and in favour of society. But this is not the only aim of the organization. It also strives for efficient and dignified execution of alternative punishments and measures. Probation and <b>Mediation</b> <b>Service</b> is based on a concept of restorative justice which is increasingly developing in the Czech Republic. It stresses the integration of offender, participation of victim and protection of society. The probation officers have to face many problems that make their work difficult. Key issue is a low awareness of the Probation and <b>Mediation</b> <b>Service</b> in society which is caused by insufficient PR strategy. The consequence of inadequate promotion is a limited cooperation between probation officers and offenders or victims. The low awareness is proved by the results of questionnaire surveys that were conducted among general public in the Czech Republic and clients of the Probation and <b>Mediation</b> <b>Service</b> centre in Prague.

The Semantic Sensor Web enables interoperability to support various applications that use data made available by semantically heterogeneous sensor services. However, several challenges {{still need to be}} addressed to achieve this vision. More particularly, mechanisms that can support context-aware semantic mapping that adapts to dynamic metadata of sensors are required. Semantic mapping for Sensor Web is required to support sensor data fusion, sensor data discovery and retrieval, and automatic semantic annotation, to name only a few applications. This paper presents a context-aware ontology-based semantic <b>mediation</b> <b>service</b> for heterogeneous sensor <b>services.</b> The semantic <b>mediation</b> <b>service</b> is context-aware and dynamic because it takes into account the real-time variability of thematic, spatial and temporal features that describe sensor data in different contexts.

40|$|Together {{with the}} reform of the {{criminal}} justice it was necessary to form a complex system of activities concerning the realization and effective usage of the introduced system of alternative punishments and deviations in criminal proceedings. On the basis of this requirement the institution of the Probation and <b>Mediation</b> <b>Service</b> (PMS) of the Czech Republic was established in 2001. The mission of the PMS is to create conditions for alternative punishments use {{in the course of the}} criminal proceedings and to ensure the effective execution of alternative punishments. For this purpose this service carries out the probation and mediation and participates in settlement of disputes between the accused and accusers and makes efforts to appease conflict situations and to restore the respect for rules of law. The integral part of the PMS mission is prevention and reducing the risk of the recurrence of criminal activity. The objective of the thesis is to examine the real public awareness of the Probation and <b>Mediation</b> <b>Service</b> of the Czech Republic, to give account of the lay public attitudes to the institution of alternative punishments. The thesis also studies opinions of alternative punishments in professionals who cooperate with the Probation and <b>Mediation</b> <b>Service.</b> Before the research the following hypotheses were stated: H I: The awareness of the lay public of the Probation and <b>Mediation</b> <b>Service</b> is low. Partial H I: The lay public gets information mostly through the television broadcasting. H II: The cooperation of professionals with the Probation and <b>Mediation</b> <b>Service</b> influences the attitude to alternative punishments, which become more acceptable to be imposed. To verify the hypotheses the quantitative research, the questionnaire method was used. I made up standardised questionnaires with a series of 15 questions. The first research set was composed of the lay public. 100 persons aged 20 { [...] } 60 years were chosen at random. The other research set comprised staff members of subjects cooperating with the Probation and <b>Mediation</b> <b>Service</b> of the Police of the Czech Republic, of local and municipal authorities, of the Employment Office, of the prison system. 50 persons were addressed on the whole.
