He {{lengthened}} the innings break by seven minutes, by remonstrating with officials to pause the {{match for the}} running of the Melbourne Cup. They agreed and the match was stopped for 13 <b>minutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> race. Queensland lost seven wickets but held on for a draw, aided by the 20 minutes lost by Miller's love of horseracing.|$|E

5|$|He started {{strongly}} with match figures of 7/87 in a drawn match against Queensland in Brisbane. The hosts managed {{to hang on}} with three wickets in hand, after Davidson's captain had held up play and wasted 20 <b>minutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> running of the Melbourne Cup. He performed steadily {{for the next six}} matches, not taking more than two wickets in any innings, before playing a prominent role in the final match of the Sheffield Shield season against Victoria. It was then 100th anniversary of matches between the old rivals. Davidson took 6/99 in the first innings, including Harvey for 128, before adding 2/61 in the second. It helped prevent a defeat on the anniversary and sealed New South Wales' hat-trick of Shield titles.|$|E

The LAX {{control tower}} mistakenly tells the pilot to turn left instead of right to {{head over the}} ocean. BR 15 instead headed north and was maintaining 5000 feet as it headed towards 5700 foot peak Mt. Wilson. EVA was forced to climb to 6000 feet.

5|$|Preparations {{began in}} January, with Madonna {{saying that the}} {{rehearsal}} was the most exhausting one {{in which she had}} ever participated. Costumes were designed by Riccardo Tisci, Givenchy, Miu Miu and Prada. The performance required 500 outfits, including customized costumes for the musical guests and assisting performers. The production team was allotted seven minutes to set up the stage, 12 <b>minutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> performance and eight minutes to take down the stage. The modular structure was assembled from a truck, with a large white fabric in front as media screens for Moment Factory. Projection mapping was used by video-hardware manufacturer Barco, with films modified for the spectators and the television audience. The stadium was equipped with Sharpys lighting arrangements from Clay Paky, and the show used Sennheiser sound equipment.|$|E
5|$|The 2005–06 {{season was}} a disappointing {{one for the}} Rockets, as McGrady {{appeared}} in only 47 games due to injury. At various points during the year, he missed time due to back spasms, including a moment in January where {{he had to be}} carried off the court in a stretcher due to a severe flare up. Despite his health concerns, McGrady was able to play in that year's All-Star Game in front of his home crowd in Houston, exploding for 36 points in just 27 <b>minutes.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> season, he averaged 24.4 points and 6.5 rebounds per game. Due in part to his frequent absences, the Rockets failed to qualify for the playoffs.|$|E
50|$|The Maschinengewehr 08 (or MG 08)—so-named after 1908, its year of adoption—was a {{development}} of the license made Maschinengewehr 01. The firing rate depends on the lock assembly used and averages 500 rounds per <b>minute</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Schloss 08 and 600 rounds per <b>minute</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Schloss 16. The gun used 250-round fabric belts of 7.92×57mm ammunition. Sustained firing would lead to overheating. It was water-cooled, using a jacket around the barrel that held approximately one gallon of water. Using a separate attachment sight with range calculator <b>for</b> indirect fire, <b>the</b> MG 08 could be operated from cover. Additional telescopic sights were also developed and used in quantity during the war.|$|R

The five most neutron-rich ones with masses 270, 271, 272, 274, and 278 (unconfirmed) appear in the decay chains of 282Nh, 287Mc, 288Mc, 294Ts, and 290Fl respectively.

5|$|Two {{incidents}} {{occurred during}} filming. On the first, seven bullet holes were shot {{into one of}} the trucks used during production.

The paramedics refused to take the victim to the hospital without a police escort. According to Stevenson, there was a possibility that rival gangmembers would shoot at the paramedics for trying to resuscitate the victim.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{an injury}} to pace {{spearhead}} Ray Lindwall, Bradman's fast bowlers reduced England in their first innings to 8/74 before finishing them off for 165. Bradman dropped two catches in this innings. English gloveman Godfrey Evans came to the crease with the score at 6/60, and hit Johnston hard to cover, where the ball went through Bradman for a boundary. The second chance went through Bradman's hand and struck him in the abdomen. However, these missed catches did not cost Australia much, as Evans was soon caught at short leg by Morris close in, leaving England at 7/74. England managed to recover somewhat after Laker and Bedser added 89 runs in only 73 <b>minutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ninth wicket. At first, Bradman did not appear concerned by the partnership, and it was surmised {{that he may have}} been happy for England to continue batting so that his top order would not have to bat in fading light {{towards the end of the}} afternoon, but he became anxious as the total continued to mount and both Bedser and Laker appeared comfortable.|$|E

5|$|Females usually {{engage with}} several males over a {{breeding}} season. The eggs are fertilised internally in the oviduct. The female deposits them individually on leaves of aquatic plants, {{such as water}} cress or floating sweetgrass, usually close to the surface, and, using her hindlegs, folds the leaf around the eggs as protection from predators and radiation. In the absence of suitable plants, the eggs may also be deposited on leaf litter, stones, or even plastic bags. In the northern crested newt, a female takes around five <b>minutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> deposition of one egg. Crested newt females usually lay around 200 eggs per season, while the marbled newt (T. marmoratus) can lay up to 400. Triturus embryos are usually light-coloured, 1.8–2mm in diameter with a 6mm jelly capsule, which distinguishes them from eggs of other co-existing newt species that are smaller and darker-coloured. A genetic particularity in the genus causes 50% of the embryos to die: their development is arrested {{when they do not}} possess two different variants of chromosome 1 (i.e., when they are homozygous for that chromosome).|$|E
5|$|It {{took five}} <b>minutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> pad workers to open all three hatch layers, {{and they could}} not drop the inner hatch to the cabin floor as intended, so they pushed {{it out of the}} way to one side. Although the cabin lights {{remained}} lit, they were at first unable to find the astronauts through the dense smoke. As the smoke cleared, they found the bodies, but were not able to remove them. The fire had partly melted Grissom's and White's nylon space suits and the hoses connecting them to the life support system. Grissom had removed his restraints and was lying on the floor of the spacecraft. White's restraints were burned through, and he was found lying sideways just below the hatch. It was determined that he had tried to open the hatch per the emergency procedure, but was not able to do so against the internal pressure. Chaffee was found strapped into his right-hand seat, as procedure called for him to maintain communication until White opened the hatch. Because of the large strands of melted nylon fusing the astronauts to the cabin interior, removing the bodies took nearly 90 minutes.|$|E

Due to the lockout, Moore signed a deal with Italy's Benetton Treviso that featured an opt-out clause that let him return to the Celtics once the lockout ended. On December 9, 2011, Moore signed a guaranteed contract with the Celtics. He debuted briefly (for less than 1 minute) in the Celtics' season-opener against the New York Knicks on Christmas Day. He posted his first rebound and assist on December 28 against the Charlotte Bobcats. He scored his first points on January 4, 2012, against the New Jersey Nets. He got significant <b>minutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{first time in a}} game against the Indiana Pacers at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in his home state, when he played 20 minutes. In the subsequent weeks with Keyon Dooling and Sasha Pavlović injured he often received a significant amount of playing time.
