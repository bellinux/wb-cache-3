50|$|<b>Machining</b> <b>time</b> is {{the time}} when a machine is {{actually}} processing something. Generally, <b>machining</b> <b>time</b> is the term used when there is a reduction in material or removing some undesirable parts of a material. For example, in a drill press, <b>machining</b> <b>time</b> is when the cutting edge is actually moving forward and making a hole. Machine time is used in other situations, such as when a machine installs screws in a case automatically.|$|E
50|$|In zig milling, {{the tool}} moves only in one direction. The tool {{has to be}} lifted and {{retracted}} after each cut, due to which <b>machining</b> <b>time</b> increases. However, in case of zig milling surface quality is better.|$|E
50|$|In zig-zag milling, {{material}} is removed both in {{forward and backward}} paths. In this case, cutting is done both with and against {{the rotation of the}} spindle. This reduces the <b>machining</b> <b>time</b> but increases machine chatter and tool wear.|$|E

50|$|<b>Machining</b> <b>time</b> {{depends on}} the workpiece's strength, hardness, {{porosity}} and fracture toughness; the slurry's material and particle size; and the amplitude of the sonotrode's vibration. The surface finish of materials after machining depends heavily on hardness and strength, with softer and weaker materials exhibiting smoother surface finishes. The inclusion of microcrack and microcavity features on the materials surface depend highly on the crystallographic orientation of the work piece's grains and the materials fracture toughness.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{important}} aspects in manufacturing calculation is how to find and calculate the <b>machining</b> <b>time</b> in a machining operation. Generally, machining is family of processes or operations in which excess material is removed from a starting work piece by a sharp cutting tool so the remaining part has the desired geometry and the required shape. The most common machining operations can be classified into four types: turning, milling, drilling and lathe work.|$|E
50|$|Geometry {{of cutting}} tools can be {{analyzed}} and modified {{as a result of}} simulated cutting forces in virtual environments. Thus, <b>machining</b> <b>time</b> as well as surface roughness can be minimized and tool life can be maximized due to decreasing cutting forces by modified geometries of cutting tools. Also, the modified versions of cutting tool geometries with regards to minimizing cutting forces can decrease cost of cutting tools by presenting a wider range of acceptable materials for cutting tools such as high-speed steel, carbon tool steels, cemented carbide, ceramic, cermet and et al.|$|E

50|$|Selecting a {{milling cutter}} {{is not a simple}} task. There are many variables, {{opinions}} and lore to consider, but essentially the machinist is trying to choose a tool which will cut the material to the required specification for the least cost. The cost of the job is a combination of the price of the tool, the time taken by the milling machine, and the time taken by the machinist. Often, for jobs {{of a large number of}} parts, and days of <b>machining</b> <b>time,</b> the cost of the tool is lowest of the three costs.|$|E
50|$|A popular {{choice for}} a CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing) {{software}} suite is MasterCAM. It is also used by Taylor Guitars. The CAM software takes the 3D model created in the CAD system and uses a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine (typically a vertical machining center) to cut out the 2D pieces from, in the example above, a sheet of aluminum. This process can eliminate waste as well as decrease <b>machining</b> <b>time</b> and machine down time. The pieces cut from the sheets of aluminum then are assembled by a worker using a TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas) welder.|$|E
50|$|During design, {{emphasis}} {{was placed on}} simplifying production and eliminating most machining operations; most of the weapon's parts were sheet-steel stamped.These measures reduced the number of machined components to a bare minimum, cutting down <b>machining</b> <b>time</b> by more than half, to 2.7 hours of machining instead of 7.3 hours for the PPSh-41. There were also savings of over 50% in raw steel usage, down to 6.2 kg instead of 13.9 kg, and fewer workers were required to manufacture and assemble the parts. Thanks to the improvements in production efficiency, the Soviet planners estimated that the new gun would have allowed an increase in monthly submachine gun output from 135,000 units to 350,000 weapons.|$|E

50|$|Pocket milling {{has been}} {{regarded}} as one of the most widely used operations in machining. It is extensively used in aerospace and shipyard industries. In pocket milling the material inside an arbitrarily closed boundary on a flat surface of a work piece is removed to a fixed depth. Generally flat bottom end mills are used for pocket milling. Firstly roughing operation is done to remove the bulk of material and then the pocket is finished by a finish end mill.Most of the industrial milling operations can be taken care of by 2.5 axis CNC milling. This type of path control can machine up to 80% of all mechanical parts. Since the importance of pocket milling is very relevant, therefore effective pocketing approaches can result in reduction in <b>machining</b> <b>time</b> and cost.NC pocket milling can be carried out mainly by two tool paths, viz. linear and non-linear.|$|E
5000|$|As {{machining}} is a subtractive process, {{the time}} to remove the material {{is a major factor}} in determining the machining cost. The volume and shape of the material to be removed as well as how fast the tools can be fed will determine the <b>machining</b> <b>time.</b> When using milling cutters, the strength and stiffness of the tool which is determined in part by the length to diameter ratio of the tool will play the largest role in determining that speed. The shorter the tool is relative to its diameter the faster it can be fed through the material. A ratio of 3:1 (L:D) or under is optimum. [...] If that ratio cannot be achieved, a solution like this depicted here can be used. [...] For holes, the length to diameter ratio of the tools are less critical, but should still be kept under 10:1.|$|E
50|$|The {{increase}} in strength due to strain hardening {{is comparable to}} that of heat treating. Therefore, it is sometimes more economical to cold work a less costly and weaker metal than to hot work a more expensive metal that can be heat treated, especially if precision or a fine surface finish is required as well. The cold working process also reduces waste as compared to machining, or even eliminates with near net shape methods. The material savings becomes even more significant at larger volumes, and even more so when using expensive materials, such as copper, nickel, gold, tantalum, and palladium. The saving on raw material as a result of cold forming can be very significant, as is saving <b>machining</b> <b>time.</b> Production cycle times when cold working are very short. On multi-station machinery, production cycle times are even less. This can be very advantageous for large production runs.|$|E

50|$|CAM {{software}} generally {{creates a}} tool path without considering any mechanics process. These causes risk of tool damage, tool deflection and errors on surface finish. By minimizing the forces we can increase tool life. Different optimization method {{can be used}} considering process parameters like feed rate, spindle speed, steps, tool diameter, magnitude and preset maximum force. The optimization can be done for minimum <b>machining</b> <b>time,</b> minimum tool travel, minimum production cost or for good surface finish. Efficiency of surface machined is also considered by maximum scallop height and by gouging. Gouging are {{the main reason for}} discrepancies of surface accuracy and texture specification. It also causes damage to part,s surface and machine tool. Scallop height tolerance help us in measuring the quality of free-form surface. Selection of proper topology result in minimum path length. In CAM software choosing NURBS to create surface is considered to be good method for presenting surface as it is accepted by both IGES and STEP files of CAM software.|$|E
50|$|The LMC {{works from}} underneath, using {{high-speed}} techniques to machine each layer in turn. As each layer is roughed and finished a new plate is bonded, {{ready for the}} next machining operation, this continues until the finished part is built up. WorkNC-LMP automates this process starting from the CAD model, firstly splitting it into layers, and then generating both the roughing and finishing toolpaths for each layer. This technique is ideal for high speed machining enabling the use of short and rigid cutters, and eliminates the possibility of a collision. WorkNC-LMP allows to select the material from a materials library and controls factors such as surface roughening prior to bonding, cutting adhesive channels to control excess glue, overlapping of cutter paths to remove traces of glue, and paths for the application of adhesive between layers. It provides the visual control of all toolpaths and the calculation of the estimated total <b>machining</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Grinding: Grinding or finish-machining {{creates the}} final {{form and the}} surface finish of the cavity in the mould insert. Usually, the finish is carried out by grinding; a {{subsequent}} polishing step is optionally required. Finish grinding can require several changes of the grinding tool and several truing steps of the tool. Finish-machining of the mould is an iterative process: As long as the machined mould shows deviations from the nominal contour in the measurement step after grinding, {{it has to be}} reground. There is no well-defined border between pre-machining and fine grinding. Throughout the grinding process of the cavity, the grain size of the tool, the feed rate and the cutting depth are reduced whereas <b>machining</b> <b>time</b> increases. Convex surfaces are easier to manufacture. The necessary steps of workpiece preparation are the mould alignment and the mould referencing. Grinding tool alignment, grinding tool referencing and grinding tool truing also have to be done. After that polishing can be necessary to remove the anisotropic structure which remains after grinding. It can be performed manually or by a CNC-machine.|$|E

40|$|The {{malicious}} {{alteration of}} <b>machine</b> <b>time</b> {{is a big}} challenge in computer forensics. Detecting such changes and reconstructing the actual timeline of events is of paramount importance. However, this can be difficult since the attacker has many opportunities and means to hide such changes.

5000|$|In wire {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (WEDM), also known as wire-cut EDM and wire cutting, a thin single-strand metal wire, usually brass, is fed through the workpiece, submerged in a tank of dielectric fluid, typically deionized water. Wire-cut EDM is typically used to cut plates as thick as 300mm and to make punches, tools, and dies from hard metals that are difficult to machine with other methods. The wire, which is constantly fed from a spool, is held between upper and lower diamond guides. The guides, usually CNC-controlled, move in the x-y plane. On most machines, the upper guide can also move independently in the z-u-v axis, giving rise to the ability to cut tapered and transitioning shapes (circle on the bottom, square at the top for example). The upper guide can control axis movements in x-y-u-v-i-j-k-l-. This allows the wire-cut EDM to be programmed to cut very intricate and delicate shapes. The upper and lower diamond guides are usually accurate to 0.004 mm, and can have a cutting path or kerf as small as 0.021 mm using Ø 0.02 mm wire, though the average cutting kerf that achieves the best economic cost and <b>machining</b> <b>time</b> is 0.335 mm using Ø 0.25 mm brass wire. The reason that the cutting width is greater than the width of the wire is because sparking occurs from the sides of the wire to the work piece, causing erosion. This [...] "overcut" [...] is necessary, for many applications it is adequately predictable and therefore can be compensated for (for instance in micro-EDM this is not often the case). Spools of wire are long — an 8 kg spool of 0.25 mm wire is just over 19 kilometers in length. Wire diameter can be as small as [...] and the geometry precision is not far from ± [...] The wire-cut process uses water as its dielectric fluid, controlling its resistivity and other electrical properties with filters and de-ionizer units. The water flushes the cut debris away from the cutting zone. Flushing {{is an important factor in}} determining the maximum feed rate for a given material thickness.Along with tighter tolerances, multi axis EDM wire-cutting machining centers have added features such as multi heads for cutting two parts at the same time, controls for preventing wire breakage, automatic self-threading features in case of wire breakage, and programmable machining strategies to optimize the operation.Wire-cutting EDM is commonly used when low residual stresses are desired, because it does not require high cutting forces for removal of material. If the energy/power per pulse is relatively low (as in finishing operations), little change in the mechanical properties of a material is expected due to these low residual stresses, although material that hasn't been stress-relieved can distort in the machining process.The work piece may undergo a significant thermal cycle, its severity depending on the technological parameters used. Such thermal cycles may cause formation of a recast layer on the part and residual tensile stresses on the work piece. If machining takes place after heat treatment, dimensional accuracy will not be affected by heat treat distortion.|$|E
40|$|Calculation of <b>machining</b> <b>time</b> {{and cost}} of {{production}} {{is one of the}} factors that need to be analyzed in making a product. Determination of <b>machining</b> <b>time</b> is to know the type of work done on each component. Level speed tool wear is one of the factors that influence the <b>machining</b> <b>time.</b> Because if drill quickly wear out the drill will often be replaced so that the use of drill costs will be higher, and the cost of production of a certain condition is not cheap, but will be more expensive.

30|$|In {{order to}} study the {{significance}} of the process variables towards <b>machining</b> <b>time,</b> ANOVA was performed. From these tables (Appendix: 1), it is clear that pulse on time, pulse off time, peak current and wire speed significantly affect both the <b>machining</b> <b>time</b> values.

As <b>machining</b> <b>time</b> is the “Smaller is better” type quality characteristic, it can be seen from Fig.  8 that the third level of pulse on time (A 3), first level of pulse off time (B 1),third level of peak current (C 3) and second level of wire speed (D 2) provide less value of <b>machining</b> <b>time.</b> The S/N data analysis (Fig.  6) also suggests the same levels of the variables (A 3, B 1, C 3, and D 2) as the best levels for minimizing <b>machining</b> <b>time</b> in WEDM process.|$|E
