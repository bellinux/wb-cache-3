50|$|A <b>meal</b> <b>voucher</b> or {{luncheon voucher}} is a voucher {{for a meal}} given to {{employees}} as an employee benefit, allowing them to eat at outside restaurants, typically for lunch.

The <b>meal</b> <b>vouchers</b> inherently belongs to the interest groups, who attempt to present system of tax relief to keep meal tickets, using political lobbying. The theoretical part is based on access to the public school choice, which deals with the first public choice theory, and then the interest groups' issue. The practical part will be applied to the public choice theory and interest groups on the current meal vouchers' system in Czech Republic for a period of the effectiveness of the current law, together with a comparative analysis with other countries. Then I analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the current employment benefits by meal tickets through their tax advantage and outline the possible effective alternatives...|$|R

40|$|The thesis aims {{to analyze}} {{distributional}} impacts of <b>meal</b> <b>voucher</b> sys- tem in the Czech Republic, {{especially in the}} context of income inequality between different income groups. In the first part, we study the features of the Czech <b>meal</b> <b>voucher</b> scheme, relevant legislative framework and offer a comparison of the Czech <b>meal</b> <b>voucher</b> system with other European coun- tries. In the second part, we perform an analysis of the redistributive effects of meal allowances on various income deciles, quantify the impact of meal allowances tax exemption on the government budget and simulate replace- ment of current meal allowances by flat meal allowances according to several scenarios. Based on our analysis, the meal allowances tax relief represents burden of 11. 3 bn Kč for the state budget. Our findings suggest that current form of meal allowances widens the income gap between beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries, within as well as across the income deciles. The aﬄuent households receive meal allowances more frequently, and moreover, nomin- ally and proportionately higher. We believe a replacement of current meal allowances scheme by one with a flat meal allowances (using the constant budget) would promote income equality. Then, the lower deciles would be- nefit, due to higher share of individuals entitled to the meal [...] ...|$|E

40|$|In two-sided networks, {{two parties}} {{interact}} on a platform, caring about {{the numbers of}} subjects on the other side. A typical problem, in this context, is setting prices for network services so as to get “both side on boards”. The standard approach in the literature considers the network’s ability to convince both sides to join the network, whereas this paper consider an alternative setting, in which one side determines the price balance. This case is exemplified by the market for <b>meal</b> <b>voucher</b> services in Italy, in which one agency organizes the procurement of services for the public sector, through a competitive auction. A formal model of optimal auction is illustrated and {{used to assess the}} current procurement scheme.

40|$|The use of {{short-term}} bonuses to motivate employees {{has become an}} organizational regularity, but {{a thorough understanding of}} the relationship between these incentives and actual perfor-mance is lacking. We aim to advance this understanding by examining how three types of bonuses (cash, family <b>meal</b> <b>voucher,</b> and verbal reward) affect employees ’ productivity in a field experiment conducted in a high-tech manufacturing factory. While all types of bonuses increased performance by over 5 %, nonmonetary short-term bonuses had a slight advantage over monetary bonuses. In addition, the removal of the bonuses led to decreased productivity for monetary bonuses but not for the verbal reward. However, this negative effect of monetary short-term bonuses diminishes when a cash bonus is chosen by employees rather than granted by default. Theoretical implications about the effect {{of short-term}} bonuses on intrinsic motiva-tion and reciprocity, as well as practical applications of short-term bonus plans that stem from our findings, are discussed...|$|E

50|$|It was {{discovered}} that {{in the rush to}} commence play in 1974, several WFL teams had paid less than the original $120,000 franchise fee in order to meet Davidson's target of 12 teams, and that league officials had conducted little to no due diligence. As a result, most of the league's teams were badly undercapitalized. By most accounts, the only reasonably well-financed teams were Memphis, Philadelphia, the Hawaiians and Southern California. In many cases, WFL teams were unable to meet the most basic of team expenses. For instance, the Portland Storm's players were reportedly being fed by sympathetic local fans, while the Hornets had their uniforms impounded for not paying a laundry bill from the time the team was located in New York. The Birmingham Americans were not paid for the last two months of the season, the Florida Blazers went three months without pay (and reportedly survived on McDonald's <b>meal</b> <b>vouchers),</b> and the Sharks were not paid for {{what turned out to be}} their last six games. The other teams' finances were not much better; the Southmen, Bell and Hawaiians were the only teams who met payroll for every week of the season.|$|R

40|$|Employees' {{benefits}} from the income taxes point of view Employee benefit {{can be defined as}} a certain advantage given to the employee by his employer on top of his salary. It is a voluntary fulfillment of the employer to which he is not obliged according to any law. Benefits represent significant motivator for current employees as well as attraction for new applicants. Benefits can be provided either in monetary or non-monetary form. The form of the benefit is usually crucial for the determination of its tax treatment on both employer's and employee's side. On the employee's side it has to be determined whether the benefit is taxable or tax exempt. On the employer's side it has to be determined whether the relating costs are tax deductible or not. The Income Taxes Act states explicitly that certain non-monetary benefits are tax non- deductible (e. g. gifts, expenses in the form of possibility to use cultural, leisure, medical, educational or sports facilities). In other cases the tax deductibility may be limited (e. g. contributions to alimentation provided by third parties including <b>meal</b> <b>vouchers).</b> On the other hand, non-monetary form is often one of the conditions for tax exemption for the employee (e. g. education, alimentation, soft drinks or possibility to use sports or medical facilities).

40|$|Purpose – This {{paper is}} aimed at {{integrating}} literature on S-D L with the interaction approach by IMP, in order to elaborate a model for representing business interaction in S-D Logic. A particular attention {{is devoted to the}} interactive and networked nature of value creation (Gummesson, 2006; Vargo & Lusch, 2008; Cova & Salle, 2008) and to the pivotal role of interactions in reciprocal value-creating processes (Gronroos, 2007; Gronroos & Ravald, 2009). Methodology/approach – Empirically we investigate the Edenred case, the global leader in the <b>meal</b> <b>vouchers</b> service. Edenred expertise in delivering end-to-end solutions for rewards, compensations, incentives, assistance and loyalty programs for employers and citizens is widely recognized worldwide. Through a longitudinal study of Edenred, we focus how actors, activities and resources evolved through the years and identify the main implications in terms of business interaction features according to a service-centered logic. Findings – Results of our study shows that combining recent advancements in the service-centered logic of marketing with the interaction model developed in the industrial network framework (Hakansson et al., 2009), provide a further understanding of interaction processes in service networks. In particular, the case study shows that when the model is applied to a service network context, new dimensions emerge, offering further specifications of the ones presented in the IMP interaction model. Research implications – The study both contributes to literature on service networks (Ford et al., 2009) and on business interaction according to the industrial network approach, especially considering that the interaction model has been mainly derived from observations of relationships between manufacturing firms. Practical implications – In-depth understanding of the features of interaction processes in time and space could support managers in identifying the critical areas for value creation, and how these areas are interrelated to each other. This knowledge, in turn, could reduce helps at exploiting synergies and interdependences between the different elements that compose interaction processes. Moreover, realizing how interactions occur could also help managers in individuating potential areas of innovation and the extended effects that can be generated by investing in them. Originality/value – Important changes in the market require in-depth understanding of the process of interaction in service networks even more stringent. Therefore the integration of two streams of research, S-D Logic and IMP approach, on a specific model (the business interaction model) represents the original contribution of the paper...|$|R
40|$|Aims, {{research}} questions and hypotheses: The {{subject of the}} research is to evaluate the possibilities of influencing job satisfaction of shift nurses by head nurses. Three aims were set based {{on the subject of}} this research. Aim 1 To assess the level of job satisfaction of nurses with working conditions. Aim 2 To evaluate the requirements of nurses to increase their job satisfaction. Aim 3 To identify the possibilities of influencing job satisfaction of nurses from the view of head nurses. Methodology and research sample: In this diploma thesis the qualitative and quantitative data collection methods were used. The quantitative research was carried out by using standardized HCI questionnaires. The questionnaires were given to nurses in selected organizations (Tábor Hospital, Jindřichův Hradec Hospital, Kutná Hora Hospital, Chýnov Retirement Home). The size of the research sample is 164 respondents. The qualitative method of the research was carried out by in-depth interviews with ward and head nurses of the selected organizations (Tábor Hospital, Jindřichův Hradec Hospital, Kutná Hora Hospital, Chýnov Retirement Home). We interviewed 10 head nurses. Conclusion and the results: The results suggest that the shift nurses are not satisfied with their job, 39 % of nurses feel to be "not very satisfied" in their job. The overall job satisfaction of nurses increases with the good working team. Job satisfaction of nurses is also influenced by the length of practice. Job satisfaction gradually decreases with the length of practice. However, in the category " 10 and more years of practice" job satisfaction increases again. Education also affects job satisfaction of nurses. The university nurses are the most satisfied, on the other hand the college nurses are the least satisfied. Job satisfaction of nurses decreases depending on physical demands of their jobs. The preferences of motivation factors of shift nurses differ in the category "Others" (<b>meal</b> <b>vouchers,</b> supplementary pension insurance). The preferences of benefits increase depending on age and the length of practice. The nurses' requirements do not change with the other benefits. The good financial evaluation would help to influence job satisfaction of nurses. Head nurses influence job satisfaction of nurses by non-financial benefits, pleasant leadership style, positive assessment and the opportunity of changing shifts. The output of this diploma thesis is the proposal of motivation program to increase job satisfaction of nurses...|$|R
40|$|Food and {{nutrition}} security exists when “…all people {{at all times}} have physical, social and economic access to food, which is safe and consumed in sufficient quantity and quality to meet their dietary needs and food preferences, and is supported by an environment of adequate sanitation, health services and care, allowing for a healthy and active life (Committee on World Food Security 2012). ” It is underpinned by four pillars: availability; access; stability and utilisation. For the most part, the dominant response to food insecurity in Australia has been charitable food relief such as soup kitchens, <b>meals,</b> <b>vouchers</b> and food parcels. More recently, the food banking industry has expanded and now is {{the primary source of}} food for agencies involved in charitable food relief (Booth & Whelan 2015). However the efforts of the charitable sector whilst admirable are problematic in that they are based on a moral responsibility to help needy people and are ineffective in addressing the issue of food insecurity. The heavy emphasis on food philanthropy and humanitarian assistance work has undermined government responsibilities with respect to the right to food (Booth, 2014). This chapter will identify social and environmental determinants of food insecurity; the measurement of food insecurity and social and physical outcomes. It will critique current responses practiced to alleviate food insecurity at an individual household level and explore the nature of a human rights approach. The right to food is enshrined in several major instruments of International law and has been defined as “… [...] the right to have regular, permanent and unobstructed access […. ] to quantitatively and qualitatively adequate and sufficient food […] which ensures a physical and mental, individual and collective fulfilling and dignified life free from anxiety” (Zeigler, 2001). A human rights approach moves food from a need to an entitlement and ensures human dignity is maintained. Typically in high income countries, those living in relative poverty are identified as being most at risk of food insecurity. These are usually listed as: those on low incomes, refugees and migrants, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, people experiencing homelessness, university students and those with a mental illness (see for example, Gallegos et al 2008; Gallegos et al 2014). However, more recently food insecurity has been identified in households on middle incomes who are experiencing financial stress due to issues related to housing and cost of living pressures. National prevalence data has consistently identified that 5...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This is a qualitative data collection. This study aimed to collect comprehensive information on all forms of resources (including income and assets) and indicative information on deprivation and style of living in order to define and measure poverty among {{a representative sample of}} the population of the United Kingdom. This major study was the result of fifteen years research. In 1964 the Joseph Rowntree Memorial Trust agreed to finance pilot studies on fatherless families, large families and unemployed and disabled people which were then to be followed by a national survey of poverty. In 1967 - 68, following pilot work, interviews were completed with 2, 052 households (6, 045 people), in 630 parliamentary constituencies throughout the United Kingdom. Another 1, 514 households (3, 539 people), were later interviewed in a poor area of Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales to secure information about the populations of the poorest areas. There were mixed reactions to the book's publication in 1979. The concept of relative deprivation provoked much discussion but the issue of multiple deprivation experienced by individuals and families was largely ignored. Comparatively little attention was paid to certain forms of deprivation - such as deprivation at work and environmental or locational deprivation - although the report gave data about multiple deprivation drawn from 60 indicators. Nearly 50 years later this study was reanalysed in a project funded by Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC). The 'Advancing Paradata' project looked at shifts and continuities in the social process of gathering household survey data about poverty. In part it does this through analysis of survey paradata from the 1968 Poverty in the UK survey. Paradata captures the gamut of by-products of the collection of survey data and is of interest in understanding and improving survey quality and costs. The main focus has been on automatically captured macro items, but this is now expanding to include interviewer-generated observations. For the 'Advancing Paradata' project, information available only on paper questionnaires at the UK Data Archive was converted into digitised form and related metadata was created. A sample of 100 survey booklets has been selected for this collection. These booklets were chosen because they have significant quantities of marginalia written on the booklets. These booklets are available via the UK Data Service QualiBank, an online tool for browsing, searching and citing the content of selected qualitative data collections held at the UK Data Service. Names of survey respondents have been removed to protect confidentiality. Main Topics : Variables: (i) Housing and living facilities: exact composition of household; adequacy of basic facilities; degree of overcrowding; deficiency of bedrooms; overall household facilities; degree of satisfaction with facilities and environment. (ii) Employment: 'work record' of each individual over previous twelve months; educational background. (iii) Occupational facilities and fringe benefits: type of facilities provided for indoor and outside employment; eligibility for fringe benefits (e. g. sick pay, occupational pension); value of fringe benefits in kind received during the year (e. g. <b>meal</b> <b>vouchers,</b> subsidised <b>meals,</b> use of vehicles). (iv) Current Monetary Income: information on total cash income in (a) previous week, (b) previous twelve months, from any source of each income unit in the household. Questions on earnings, income of self- employed, government social security benefits, and miscellaneous sources of income. Also questions on housing costs and house value. (v) Savings and assets: information on the value of savings and assets owned by the household, including housing and household or personal possessions. (vi) Health and disability: general assessment of health of household members; details of any illnesses or disabilities; capacity to undertake ordinary personal and household activities; (vii) Social services: utilisation of services including periods in hopital and visits to doctors and dentists.
