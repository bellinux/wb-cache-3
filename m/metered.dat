40|$|Identification of aquifer layer {{location}} {{has been}} done using Schlumberger configuration of geoelectric resistivity methods in Masaran District. Data collection was performed using resistivity <b>meter</b> OYO Mc-el-ohm series 2119 c having a length of current electrode (AB / 2) from 1. 5 m to 350 <b>meters.</b> Data processing was done using software IP 2 win. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify the location of confined aquifer and unconfined aquifer. The result showed that litology of aquifer layers were detected as clayed sand, sands and gravel sands. The depth of confined aquifer was detected for TS 1 (4. 52 <b>meters</b> to 8. 57 <b>meters</b> and 22. 4 <b>meters</b> to 34 <b>meters),</b> TS 2 (8. 84 <b>meters</b> to 20. 9 <b>meters),</b> TS 3 (2. 87 <b>meters</b> to 10 <b>meters</b> and 13. 3 <b>meters</b> to 41. 5 <b>meters),</b> TS 4 (20. 09 <b>meters</b> to 6. 71 <b>meters</b> and 17. 3 <b>meters</b> to 36. 4 <b>meters)</b> and TS 5 (6. 3 <b>meters</b> to 25 <b>meters).</b> The thickest layer of confined aquifer was TS 3.

However, the state put its plans on hold shortly thereafter, following several concerns from the public, and from state senator Jim Ellis.|$|E
5|$|Buses, {{which are}} the most {{commonly}} used mode of transport, are run by government agencies and private operators. Kolkata is the only Indian city with a tram network, which is operated by the Calcutta Tramways Company. The slow-moving tram services are restricted to certain areas of the city. Water-logging, caused by heavy rains that fall during the summer monsoon, can interrupt transportation networks. Hired public conveyances include auto rickshaws, which often ply specific routes, and yellow <b>metered</b> taxis. Almost all of Kolkata's taxis are antiquated Hindustan Ambassadors by make; newer air-conditioned radio taxis are also in service. In parts of the city, cycle rickshaws and hand-pulled rickshaws are patronised by the public for short trips.|$|E
5|$|Several government-owned organisations operate bus {{services}} in the state, including the Calcutta State Transport Corporation, the North Bengal State Transport Corporation, the South Bengal State Transport Corporation, the West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation, and the Calcutta Tramways Company. There are also private bus companies. The railway system is a nationalised service without any private investment. Hired forms of transport include <b>metered</b> taxis and auto rickshaws, which often ply specific routes in cities. In most of the state, cycle rickshaws, and in Kolkata, hand-pulled rickshaws and electric rickshaws, are used for short-distance travel.|$|E

5|$|The road's name, {{along with}} the area, {{is derived from the}} {{original}} 14th century White Chapel. It follows the section of the Roman road between Londinium (London) and Camulodunum (Colchester), which connected to the Pye Road to Venta Icenorum (Caistor St Edmund near Norwich). The section of the Roman road that is now Whitechapel Road is a Primary A-road, the A11, and has bus lanes running along its length. Owing to the popularity of the market, parking is heavily restricted, limited to occasional parking <b>metered</b> spaces along the road.|$|E

It operates a sewerage system and a wastewater treatment plant. Water consumption is <b>metered.</b> The average monthly tariff is US$3.5 for 28m3. There is no social stratification, but special tariffs are applied to those users who consume more than 28m3. The annual cash surplus is about US$10,000 which is reinvested in preventive maintenance {{and in some cases}} in construction works. In this way, in the last 3years a water capture facility was constructed in Quebrada Epaminondas, another one at Melendez River was improved, and a water tank with a capacity of 220m3 was constructed.|$|E

Taken together with equally strong numbers for the station's returning original series – Sons of Anarchy, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and The League – the episode helped make October the most-watched month on FX ever. The pilot episode aired on November 7, 2011 across Europe and Latin America on Fox International Channels, ranking #1 or #2 among all Pay-TV in most <b>metered</b> markets across Latin America and Europe for its time slot.

5|$|Many {{elements}} {{first introduced}} {{in this game}} have remained in the series. For instance, non-player characters (NPCs) were present in The Legend of Zelda, but their role was rather limited. Starting with The Adventure of Link, Zelda games have prominently featured a variety of NPCs who play pivotal roles in Link's quests. Zelda II {{was also one of}} the first games where NPCs walked around and seemingly had their own agendas, giving the world a life of its own rather than being a simple stage for the story to unfold. The use of <b>metered</b> magic and spells has also carried over into other Zelda games. The Triforce of Courage makes its first appearance in The Adventure of Link and plays an important role in later Zelda games, as it is strongly associated with Link. Dark Link is a version of Link's Shadow which appears in , a similar Link clone called Shadow Link appears in , and yet another appears in , as well as in A Link Between Worlds.|$|E
