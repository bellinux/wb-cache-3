Peter Serkin and composer Oliver Knussen were also there, as was cellist Fred Sherry. Though he was the senior of our group by many years, Toru stayed up with us every night and literally drank us under the table. I was confirmed in <b>my</b> <b>impression</b> of Toru {{as a person who}} lived his life like a traditional Zen poet." ...|$|E
500|$|Bundy {{confessed to}} 30 homicides, but the true total remains unknown. Published {{estimates}} have {{run as high}} as 100 or more, and Bundy occasionally made cryptic comments to encourage that speculation. He told Hugh Aynesworth in 1980 that for every murder [...] "publicized", there [...] "could be one that was not." [...] When FBI agents proposed a total tally of 36, Bundy responded, [...] "Add one digit to that, and you'll have it." [...] Years later he told attorney Polly Nelson that the common estimate of 35 was accurate, but Robert Keppel wrote that [...] " [...] and I both knew [...] was much higher." [...] "I don't think even he knew ... how many he killed, or why he killed them", said Rev. Fred Lawrence, the Methodist clergyman who administered Bundy's last rites. [...] "That was <b>my</b> <b>impression,</b> my strong impression." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{relative}} importance given {{to each of}} these three strategies has varied over time and between different contexts. The general impression in the current Churches of Christ is that the group's hermeneutics are entirely based on the command, example, inference approach. [...] In practice, interpretation has been deductive, and heavily influenced by the group's central commitment to ecclesiology and soteriology. [...] Inductive reasoning has been used as well, as when all of the conversion accounts from the book of Acts are collated and analyzed to determine the steps necessary for salvation. [...] One student of the movement summarized the traditional approach this way: [...] "In most of their theologizing, however, <b>my</b> <b>impression</b> is that spokespersons in the Churches of Christ reason from Scripture in a deductive manner, arguing from one premise or hypothesis to another so as to arrive at a conclusion. In this regard the approach is much like that of science which, in practice moves deductively from one hypothesis to another, rather than in a Baconian inductive manner." [...] In recent years, changes in the degree of emphasis placed on ecclesiology and soteriology has spurred a reexamination of the traditional hermeneutics among some associated with the Churches of Christ.|$|E

500|$|The {{adaptation}} received mostly negative {{reviews from}} the press, believing {{it did not}} match up to Hitchcock's 1935 film version (as predicted by Mickery). Sam Wollaston of The Guardian felt that the romance scene between Hannay and Victoria (when they stay overnight in an inn) was [...] "one of the silliest ever" [...] and felt that after the final scene at the loch and the concluding scene: [...] "It's all very silly.... It doesn't have the pace, the moodiness or the wit." [...] Damien Love of Sunday Herald felt the [...] "tepid pace" [...] was set by the casting of Penry-Jones, and that he [...] "has a style reminiscent of the young Roger Moore, but without the vital, animating spark of self-deprecation. As Hannay, Penry-Jones is not at his best, and more reminiscent of a well-stuffed armchair on wheels." [...] Mick Hume of The Times said [...] "The overall effect was to turn Buchan's blood and thunder tale into a pallid politically correct Enid Blyton story", and The Independents Robert Hanks concluded his review by saying that [...] "By the end, <b>my</b> <b>impression</b> was that several pages of the plot must have been eaten by a dog, or a bored actor, and the director had decided, sod it, nobody's going to keep watching this long. Which I wouldn't have if I wasn't being paid." ...|$|E
500|$|Hurley had {{objected to}} the violent and gory scenes seen in the first-season episode [...] "", written by Tracy Tormé, and Tormé {{continued}} to feel alienated by Hurley. Tormé stepped down from his role as co-executive story editor, taking credit instead as a creative consultant. Following Hurley's modifications to Tormé's scripts for [...] "The Royale" [...] and [...] "", Tormé elected to be credited under a pseudonym only. At one point, Roddenberry had thought that Tormé would become eventual showrunner, but the writer left due to the re-writes required under Hurley's tenure. Hannah Louise Shearer also left the team between seasons, due to differences with Hurley, but contributed stories in later seasons. Other writers joined the team during the second season, including The Tears of the Singers author Melinda M. Snodgrass, who sold the script for [...] "". Hans Beimler and Richard Manning were hired in the newly created positions of executive script consultants. They had both been story editors for the final eight episodes of the first season. Snodgrass later explained that, [...] "Once I came on board there suddenly seemed to be this climate of discussion among the writers about {{what we wanted to}} do with the show. <b>My</b> <b>impression</b> was that this was a new phenomenon. We were a little bit more on the same wavelength." [...] She was hired as a story editor following the submission of her first episode, alongside Leonard Mlodinow and Scott Rubenstein. The other two editors left after four more episodes, with Snodgrass remaining as the sole story editor for the rest of the season.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} {{raises questions}} about the range to which copyright law can extend. Alex Chapman of Campbell Hooper solicitors, stated [...] "The Church will have an uphill battle in a legal claim against Sony, and indeed it is likely that there is no basis for a claim." [...] He cited a provision in the UK's 1988 Copyright Designs and Patents act that [...] "explicitly states that it is not copyright infringement to represent certain artistic works that are on public display". This includes sculptures and buildings which are [...] "permanently situated in a public place or in premises open to the public". Chapman also pointed out that, in the UK, copyright expires 70 years after the person who created the work dies. He went on to say, [...] "What all this means is that public buildings are generally fair game for inclusion in video games, films et cetera, and it is something that their owners just have to accept. What isn't fair game, however, is if the building is presented in a way that could be said to be defamatory in relation to those associated with it and this might be what the Church is more concerned about. Also if the representation of the building could be argued to have become so closely associated with a business that its representation amounts to a false endorsement of Sony or its products, or it is registered as a trademark, there may be issues. In each case however <b>my</b> <b>impression</b> is that the Church will have some difficulty in pursuing Sony. There is no law against insensitivity and as with many matters of this kind, it is the public reaction that might be more damaging than the legal one." [...] An unofficial review, by lawyers at Freeth Cartwright, of the rights that Sony might have infringed concluded that the Church of England did not have a case on either copyright or passing off grounds.|$|E

If he's from South Carolina, he wasn't really down-home South Carolina — that's <b>my</b> <b>impression.</b> I can't picture Stephen eating grits, but who knows?" [...] Colbert promptly ate several bowls of grits on the next night's show. Carol Fowler, the S.C. Democratic Party chairwoman, stated that Colbert's long absence from the state following his leave for college might backfire on him. The scheme might not work against the other candidates anyway. [...] "By primary day, they’ll all be claiming to be from here," [...] she said.|$|E
2500|$|To {{investigate}} the sinking and failed rescue operation, the Navy convened {{a court of}} inquiry presided over by Rear Admiral Richard H. Jackson.

Ask the technical people. ... I am not familiar with the details of the construction of submarines, but those who were there thought the steps being taken were the proper ones. ...

2500|$|He {{describes}} it, {{near the}} Big Falls, about one {{hundred yards from}} the top of the mountain at Loup Creek, [...] "When I first saw it, fifty-eight years ago, it was in a much better state of preservation than it now is. At that time a large portion of it was standing fully six or seven feet high, and was well built. Its thickness was about two feet at the base, and slightly tapered towards the top. There were a number of gates, or openings, in the wall, that are quite perceptible even at this time. They were, however, very plainly perceivable a half century ago. From the number of stones promiscuously scattered in the vicinity of the wall, <b>my</b> <b>impression</b> is that it was originally greater than seven or even eight feet in height." [...] This wall was nearly three and a half miles long. Some have surmised it was nearly 10 miles long in total, having short branching elements also connected. Parts of these walls were damaged during the 20th century.|$|E

2500|$|Music writer Richard Goldstein related his {{impression}} of Wilson {{based on a}} meeting in 1967: [...] "I've read monographs on the Beach Boys that describe Wilson as a self-conscious artist, fully aware of musical history. That [...] wasn't <b>my</b> <b>impression.</b> He came across as a typical rock autodidact, deeply insecure about his creative instincts, terrified that the songs {{he was working on}} were too arty to sell." [...] According to Van Dyke Parks, Wilson was a highly innovative songwriter, but it was a [...] "mistake" [...] to call him a genius. In Parks' opinion, Harry Nilsson [...] "was truly a genius-- the smartest guy I ever met in the music business. ... He followed his own nose without any sense of apology, reserving even the right to be wrong because he knew that it was necessary to keep that right to reach any height." [...] By the 1980s, Wilson was paying his psychologist Eugene Landy a salary of about $300,000 a year for advice on creative decisions. Wilson's family subsequently alleged that Landy was [...] "unduly" [...] influencing him in personal and financial matters, and in response, California courts enacted a restraining order between the two.|$|E
