5000|$|In {{standard}} form, the Fairlane is 12 in {{shorter than}} a Galaxie, rides on a 3.5 in shorter wheelbase and weighs approximately 700 lb less. Installing the Ford FE V8 {{in a vehicle}} intended for an engine {{no larger than a}} Ford Windsor/Challenger engine required major reworking and relocation of the car's front suspension components and the modification and strengthening of the suspension <b>mounting</b> <b>areas.</b> Fiberglass doors, hood, front fenders and even the front bumper on the earliest cars along with Plexiglas side and rear windows aided in weight reduction; the hood with its distinctive raised [...] "teardrop" [...] ram air scoop designed to draw hot air from the engine compartment was pinned in position, eliminating the need for a hood hinges and a latch. Later cars have aluminum front bumpers in place of the fiberglass units due to racing regulations.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) antennas {{developed for}} different earth observation missions. Such missions often require Precise Orbit Determination (POD). The largest error contribution to POD measurements is usually local multipath, i. e. signals {{reflected in the}} satellite structure. Antenna radiation in the back direction must hence be suppressed, {{while at the same}} time keep a good coverage at low elevation angles. This is normally achieved by using a standard antenna element placed in a larger choke ring structure. The disadvantage with this arrangement is that the antenna becomes large and relatively heavy. The objective has hence been to develop small and lightweight antennas with low back radiation in combination with good coverage. We have worked with both low profile Patch Excited Cup (PEC), as well as helix antennas. Two of the described antennas are PEC antennas. One smaller, suitable on satellites without large flat <b>mounting</b> <b>areas,</b> and one design where the low elevation gain was traded against the back radiation and a good compromise was achieved using only two narrow choke rings to facilitate mounting on larger flat surfaces. A high-performance conical quadrifilar helix antenna has earlier been developed for applications where a taller antenna can be accommodated...|$|E
40|$|The run-out {{report for}} a {{compressor}} rotor showed an almost continuous bow {{between the two}} bearings, with the maximum run-out of 0. 03 mm (0. 0012 in) at the inlet to the fourth stage impeller. It had been run in service, and removed for normal maintenance, when the bow was observed. The seven stage compressor rotor was made of 34 Cr Ni Mo 6 steel, which is approximately a 4340 steel. It was just over 3 m in length, with diameters of approximately 265 mm at the disk <b>mounting</b> <b>areas</b> (Fig. 1). Each of the compressor stages was mounted on the rotor {{at the time of}} the stress measurement. An evaluation of the residual stress at these locations in the shaft was performed using a nondestructive technique involving critically refracted longitudinal, LCR, ultrasonic waves. The LCR stress measurement data showed compressive stress on the bowed side of the rotor, supporting the conclusion that residual stress is the cause of the bow. At the time that the data were taken, the rotor was horizontal, resting on two stands at the bearing ends. The following is a brief report of the test and the results. Ref. 1 should be consulted for additional detail...|$|E

40|$|Ride comfort, driving {{stability}} and drivability are vital factors {{in terms of}} vehicle performance and the customer satisfaction. The power plant (IC engine) is the source for the vibration that reduces the vehicle performance and it need to be controlled to some extent such that the vehicle performance will be improved. The IC engine {{is made up of}} reciprocating and rotating parts and they produce unbalanced forces during their operation and produce the vibratory output at the vehicle supporting members. The vibration reduction will be possible by minimizing unbalanced forces and by providing the anti vibration mounts at the engine-vehicle interface. Many researches were made to find the causes for the vibration and to reduce the vibrations at the engine supports. But still there is a research gap on the vibration modeling and vibration isolation of the engine. In this work, an attempt is made to represent the state-of-the- art for the engine vibrations and its isolations and to provide a gate way for the future work on it. It reveals the various work carried out on the engine multibody modeling of the IC engine components and different engine mountsand their orientations. The review is structured as engine multibody modeling, engine vibrations and engine <b>mounting</b> <b>areas</b> and revealed the gaps and untouched parts that requires further research...|$|E
40|$|This master thesis {{covers the}} process {{followed}} in the re-design and optimization of a structural part in a supercar. The part reviewed is the Rear Cross Frame currently in production of all Koenigsegg’s supercars. In the new revision of the part, the material is Carbon Fiber. The version currently in production is made of steel. The shape has been modified to fit the Carbon Fiber manufacturing requirements and to fulfill better the load conditions to which the part will be subjected. The Carbon Fiber lay-up has been optimized, to achieve the lightest possible result and retain the same stiffness levels as the current Rear Cross Frame. The {{first step in the}} process has been the detection of the points to improve with respect to the old part. The achievement of a good tradeoff between stiffness improvement and weight reduction has been then set as a goal, as well as a visually appealing part. In this stage the parts involved at any phase of the whole thesis process are introduced to be familiarized with their names. After that, a package of the area and the design space for the new part has been created. This design spaces take all the available space to define the volume boundaries of the new rear cross frame. A simplified version of the structural parts in the zone of the rear cross frame is as well conceived. With the design space and the simplified structural geometry a topology optimization has been performed. The adequate load cases have been introduced, representing different driving situations. With the output of the topology optimization some decisions have been taken in order to define some aspects that the final part will include. Using the topology optimization results as a guideline, the final CAD model has been created. In this step, manufacturing constraints for carbon fiber parts such as de-molding angles have been kept in mind. Once the final CAD model has been finished a CAE analysis has been performed. This analysis consists in the optimization of the carbon fiber lay-up for the model. The composite plies have been defined in shape, direction and material in order to better fulfill the objectives and Koenigsegg’s carbon fiber part standards. Once the general lay-up has been defined, the <b>mounting</b> <b>areas</b> have been revised. The general approach includes aluminum inserts in the carbon fiber part. These inserts offer good connection and bolting surfaces as well as a nice load propagation to the carbon fiber. The connection with the Rollover Bar Bracket has been re-designed, as well as the Rollover Bar Bracket itself, to achieve a lighter and mounting-friendlier solution. In the next phase the molds and masters needed to produce the part have been designed. In addition, the steps to generate the molds and final parts have been detailed and has been indicated how to glue the different elements together. The thesis results present the final part offering the same stiffness, being lighter and better looking that the part currently in production but less cost efficient. At the moment of the thesis publication, the solution hasn’t been implemented in the cars...|$|E
