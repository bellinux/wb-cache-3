Jasmonic acid and <b>methyl</b> <b>jasmonate</b> (0. 25 – 3 [*]mM) were each equally cytotoxic to both clones, whereas mutant p 53 -expressing cells were resistant to treatment with the radiomimetic agent neocarzinostatin and the chemotherapeutic agent bleomycin.

The treatments were carried out by spraying two distinct concentrations of <b>methyl</b> <b>jasmonate</b> (0. 01 mM and 0. 1 mM) on berry plants. Cultivar to cultivar variations in the contents of ellagic acid and myricetin were observed in untreated berries. No varietal differences were however found in quercetin content.

Preharvest <b>methyl</b> <b>jasmonate</b> always resulted in a general increase of the flavonoids studied, particularly, ellagic acid and quercetin. For instance, the content of ellagic acid increased approximately from 10 to 22 mg 100 g- 1 and quercetin increased from 6 to 16 mg 100 g- 1 in Glen Lyon raspberries.
