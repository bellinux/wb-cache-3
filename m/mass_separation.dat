40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2001 The Newtonian Law of Universal Gravitation {{states that}} the {{strength}} of the gravitational force between point test bodies falls as the inverse-square of the distance between them. Recently, novel new theoretical scenario, inspired by string or M theory, predict possible violations of this inverse-square behavior with test <b>mass</b> <b>separations</b> below 1 mm. Motivated by these theories, we tested the gravitational inverse-square law at separations ranging down to 138 mum using 10 -fold symmetric torsion pendulums and rotating 10 -fold symmetric attractors. We improved previous constraints on inverse square law violations by up to a factor of 104 and saw no deviations from Newtonian physics. These measurements describe the first direct observation of the gravitational interaction with test <b>mass</b> <b>separations</b> below 0. 5 mm. We performed two similar experiments denoted by 'I' and 'II' throughout the text.

50|$|A central {{goal of the}} new EURISOL {{facility}} is to produce a variety of exotic ions at yields orders of magnitude above those currently available at RIB installations around the world. To fully utilize such high intensity beams and avoid overwhelming (and dangerous) isobaric contamination, accompanying efforts are needed in the new field of beam preparation and purification. In order to use high-resolution <b>mass</b> <b>separation</b> to eliminate isobaric impurities, a reduction of the beam emittance by an RFQ coolers is necessary to minimize transmission losses. As a result, a key feature in next generation RFQ beam coolers will be their ability to handle beam currents in the microampere range. Task 9's main objective will be to determine the ability of these next-generation devices to accumulate, cool, bunch and purify EURISOL's high intensity radioactive ion beams.|$|E

Environmental sediment samples and relative SPLITT sub-fractions were subject to Inductive Coupled Plasma – Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) characterization for the following elements: Al, Fe, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Mn, Pb and Zn.

5000|$|Before <b>mass</b> <b>separation,</b> {{a beam of}} {{positive}} ions has to be extracted from the plasma and focused into the mass-analyzer. It is important to separate the ions from UV photons, energetic neutrals and from any solid particles {{that may have been}} carried into the instrument from the ICP. Traditionally, ICP-MS instruments have used transmitting ion lens arrangements for this purpose. Examples include the Einzel lens, the Barrel lens, Agilent's Omega Lens [...] and Perkin-Elmer's Shadow Stop. Another approach is to use ion guides (quadrupoles, hexapoles, or octopoles) to guide the ions into mass analyzer along a path away from the trajectory of photons or neutral particles. Yet another approach is Varian patented used by Analytik Jena ICP-MS 90 degrees reflecting parabolic [...] "Ion Mirror" [...] optics, which are claimed to provide more efficient ion transport into the mass-analyzer, resulting in better sensitivity and reduced background. Analytik Jena ICP-MS PQMS is the most sensitive instrument on the market.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{commonly}} used ionization method for off-line instrument is electron ionization (EI) which is a hard ionization technique that utilized 70 eV to ionize the sample, which causes significant fragmentation {{that can be used}} in a library search to identify the compounds. The separation method that EI is usually coupled with is gas chromatography (GC), where in GC the particles are separated by their boiling points and polarity, followed by solvent extraction of the samples collected on the filters. [...] An alternative to solvent-based extraction for particulates on filters is the use of thermal extraction (TE)-GC/MS, which utilizes oven interfaced with the GC inlet to vaporize the analyte of the sample and into the GC inlet. This technique is more often used then solvent-based extraction, because of its better sensitivity, eliminates need for solvents, and can be fully automated. [...] To increase the separation of the particles the GC can be coupled with a time of flight (TOF)-MS, which is a <b>mass</b> <b>separation</b> method that separates ions based on their size. Another method that utilizes EI is isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IR-MS) this instrumentation incorporates a magnetic sector analyzer and a faraday-collector detector array and separates ions based on their isotopic abundance. Isotopic abundance of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen isotopic abundance become locally enriched or depleted through a variety of atmospheric processes. [...] This information helps in determining the source of the aerosols and the interaction it has had.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} the stellar flux on exoplanetary systems is {{becoming}} an increasingly important property as more planets are discovered in the Habitable Zone (HZ). The Kepler mission has recently uncovered circumbinary planets with relatively complex HZs due to the combined flux from the binary host stars. Here we derive HZ boundaries for circumbinary systems and show their dependence on the stellar <b>masses,</b> <b>separation,</b> and time while accounting for binary orbital motion and the orbit of the planet. We include stability regimes for planetary orbits in binary systems {{with respect to the}} HZ. These methods are applied to several of the known circumbinary planetary systems such as Kepler- 16, 34, 35, and 47.

Apart from that effect, the estimate of the number flux is not dependent on the assumed ion mass. For high energy the <b>mass</b> <b>separation</b> is less reliable, so we present all data as the sum of the flux of all heavy ions. The average distribution functions at low energy, i.e. mostly close to the planet, can be well fitted by a drifting Maxwellian. We have done so for the low energy data, thereby extrapolating to lower energies than those observed.|$|E

The correct ordering of masses is obtained (contrary to {{the case for the}} conventional interpretation as 3 quarks with L= 1) and the splittings are plausible. The parity of these states is not measured, only assumed to be negative. In the hybrid picture, the lightest states are parity even and the parity odd counterparts lie about 300 MeV higher. Thus the hybrid ansatz predicts that either the parity of the Λ(1405) etc is positive, or that there are undiscovered positive parity states about 300 MeV lower.

40|$|Natural {{organic matter}} (NOM) found in soil, {{sediment}} and water has diverse mixture and molecular structural complexity. This complexity has been simplified by number-average molecular models, but the documental validity {{of these models}} decreases as the heterogeneity of the mixture increases, coupled with chemical and physical alterations that occur during NOM extraction and analysis. NOM models based on assumptions of extensive condensation and oxidative coupling reactions in humification processes portrayed NOM as macromolecular random-coil shapes, but more recent NOM models based on analytical evidence indicate that NOM is an aggregate of small molecules. Various organic matter fractionation approaches have been developed that separate NOM molecules into relatively homogeneous compound classes. Compound-class model structures developed from data synthesis of elemental, titrimetric, and nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared, and mass spectral analyses are better approximations of chemical structures than obtained previously on unfractionated NOM.
