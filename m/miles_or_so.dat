He ran a distance of over 225 kilometers (140 miles), arriving in Sparta {{the day after he}} left. Then, following the battle, the Athenian army marched the 40 kilometers (25 <b>miles)</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> back to Athens at a very high pace (considering the quantity of armour, and the fatigue after the battle), in order to head off the Persian force sailing around Cape Sounion. They arrived back in the late afternoon, {{in time to see the}} Persian ships turn away from Athens, thus completing the Athenian victory.|$|E
25|$|Robertson {{was clear}} {{that it would take}} more than one battle (28 December 1915, 1 January 1916) to defeat Germany, but like many British generals he {{overestimated}} the chances of success on the Somme, noting that Britain had more ammunition and big guns than before, that by attacking on a wide front of 20 <b>miles</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> the attackers would not be subjected to enfilade German artillery fire (in the event this probably spread the artillery too thin, contributing to the disaster of 1 July) and that attrition would work in the Allies’ favour as “the Germans are approaching the limit of their resources”.|$|E

The bridge predated {{the construction of the}} Severn Tunnel, a dozen <b>miles</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> downstream, by seven years. The opening ceremony for the bridge took place on 17 October 1879; nearly four hundred dignitaries travelled in twenty-three first class carriages across the bridge and back again, with fog signals exploding on each of the spans during the return trip. A banquet followed at the Pleasure Grounds near Sharpness station.|$|E

500|$|Descriptions of {{the battle}} differ, and its {{location}} is debated. The decisive and perhaps sole engagement took place on 8June 218; Dio places it at a defile outside of a village believed to be Immae, approximately twenty-four <b>miles</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> by road between Antioch and Beroea. Herodian challenges this assertion, suggesting that the battle took place closer to the borders of Syria Coele and Syria Phoenice, possibly near Emesa. Downey then suggests that two battles took place: an initial engagement matching the one described by Herodian, and a later battle near Antioch, which [...] Downey agrees was the decisive point in the rebellion. Other historians either support Dio's suggested site near Antioch or make no claim {{with regards to the}} location of the engagement.|$|E
500|$|By 21 March, the French and Austrian {{outposts}} overlapped, and skirmishing intensified. [...] Charles had divided his force {{into four}} columns. Fürstenberg covered the [...] northern {{flank of the}} Archduke's main force. Fürstenberg's force pushed the French out of Davidsweiler, and then advanced on Ruppersweiler [...] and Einhard, 5 kilometers (3mi) to the northwest of Ostrach. Saint-Cyr {{did not have the}} manpower to defend the position, and the entire line fell back to Ostrach, with Fürstenberg's troops pressuring their withdrawal. Fürstenberg's persistent pressure on the French left flank was instrumental in the collapse of {{the northern part of the}} French line. After their success in driving the French back from Ostrach, and then from the heights of Pfullendorf, the Austrian forces continued to press the French back to Stockach, and then another five <b>miles</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> to Engen.|$|E

500|$|Sophiatown was {{originally}} {{part of the}} Waterfall farm. Over time it included the neighbouring areas of Martindale and Newclare. It was purchased by a speculator, Hermann Tobiansky, in 1897. He acquired 237acres four <b>miles</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> west of the centre of Johannesburg. The private leasehold township was surveyed in 1903 and divided into almost 1700 small stands. The township was named after Tobiansky's wife, Sophia, {{and some of the}} streets were named after his children Toby, Gerty, Bertha and Victoria. Before the enactment of the Natives Land Act, 1913, black South Africans had freehold rights, and they bought properties in the suburb. The distance from the city centre was seen as disadvantageous and after the City of Johannesburg built a sewage plant nearby, the area seemed even less attractive. [...] Because of these and other reasons most of the whites had moved out by 1920, leaving behind a vibrant multi-racial community. By the late 1940s Sophiatown had a population of nearly 54000 Black Africans, 3000 Coloureds, 1500 Indians and 686 Chinese.|$|E

2500|$|Owing {{to a large}} {{error in}} the factory head bolt torque {{specifications}} (likely owing to switching away from using an asbestos head gasket {{in lieu of a}} copper one), all of these engines had severe problems with blown head gaskets.

During those twenty-three days I had not spent altogether more than three hours at the helm, including the time occupied in beating into Keeling harbour.
