5|$|Cho {{attended}} {{secondary schools}} in Fairfax County, including Ormond Stone Middle School in Centreville and Westfield High School in Chantilly, and by eighth grade {{had been diagnosed}} with selective <b>mutism,</b> a social anxiety disorder which inhibited him from speaking.|$|E
5|$|In middle school, he was {{diagnosed}} with a severe anxiety disorder with selective <b>mutism,</b> as well as major depressive disorder. After his diagnosis, he began receiving treatment and continued to receive therapy and special education support until his junior year of high school. During Cho's last two years at Virginia Tech, several instances of his abnormal behavior, as well as plays and other writings he submitted containing references to violence, caused concern among teachers and classmates.|$|E
5|$|Language {{assessment}} {{will allow}} the recognition of medical conditions presenting with aphonia or dysarthria, neurological conditions such as stroke or dementia presenting with aphasia, and specific language disorders such as stuttering, cluttering or <b>mutism.</b> People with autism or Asperger syndrome may have abnormalities in paralinguistic and pragmatic aspects of their speech. Echolalia (repetition of another person's words) and palilalia (repetition of the subject's own words) can be heard with patients with autism, schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease. A person with schizophrenia might use neologisms, which are made-up words which have a specific meaning to the person using them.|$|E
5|$|More {{than four}} months after the attack, The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} on August 20, 2007, that Cho had been diagnosed with selective <b>mutism.</b> The Virginia Tech Review Panel report, also released in August 2007, placed this diagnosis in the spring of Cho's eighth-grade year, and his parents sought treatment for him through medication and therapy. In high school, Cho was placed in special education under the 'emotional disturbance' classification. He was excused from oral presentations and participation in class conversation and received 50 minutes a month of speech therapy. He continued receiving mental health therapy as well until his junior year, when Cho rejected further therapy.|$|E
25|$|Other {{disorders}} {{with symptoms}} resembling stuttering include Asperger's syndrome, cluttering, Parkinson's speech, essential tremor, palilalia, spasmodic dysphonia, selective <b>mutism,</b> and social anxiety.|$|E
25|$|Callan – Callan is {{a patient}} of Dr. Yealland {{who has served}} in every major battle in World War I. He finds himself {{in the care of}} Dr. Yealland after {{suffering}} from <b>mutism.</b> Callan tries to fight against his doctor's treatment but eventually gives in to it.|$|E
25|$|Other {{problems}} {{to be considered in}} the differential diagnosis include selective <b>mutism,</b> stereotypic movement disorder and bipolar disorder as well as traumatic brain injury or birth trauma, conduct disorder, Cornelia De Lange syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, fragile X syndrome, dyslexia, Fahr syndrome, hyperlexia, leukodystrophy, multiple sclerosis and Triple X syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} are {{a group of}} mental disorders characterized by feelings of anxiety and fear. Anxiety is a worry about future events and fear is a reaction to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as a fast heart rate and shakiness. There {{are a number of}} anxiety disorders: including generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and selective <b>mutism.</b> The disorder differs by what results in the symptoms. People often have more than one anxiety disorder.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Sassoon's conflict, the opening {{chapters of the}} novel describe the suffering of other soldiers in the hospital. Anderson, a former surgeon, now cannot stand the sight of blood. Haunted by terrible hallucinations after being thrown into the air by an explosion and landing head first in the ruptured stomach of a rotting dead soldier, Burns experiences a revulsion to eating. Another patient, Billy Prior, suffers from <b>mutism</b> and will only write communications with Rivers on a notepad. Prior eventually regains his voice, but remains a difficult patient for Rivers avoiding any discussion of his war memories.|$|E
25|$|Newson {{had worked}} for London Underground since 1969 and the {{post-mortem}} examination {{did not find any}} evidence of a medical problem, such as a stroke or heart attack, that could have incapacitated him. There was some doubt as to whether he had consumed alcohol. Testing for this was hampered by the four-and-a-half days it took to retrieve his body from the wreckage. Analysis showed that his blood alcohol level, {{at the time of the}} post-mortem, was 80mg/100ml, but it was not possible to reach a definite conclusion as to whether this was the result of consumption of alcohol or a product of the process of decomposition. 80mg/100ml is the current English legal limit for driving a car (the limit at the time of the accident was higher), and the medical experts disagreed with each other on whether any amount consumed would have affected his ability to drive the train. Medical evidence to the official inquiry raised the possibility that the driver had been affected by a condition such as transient global amnesia, or akinesis with <b>mutism,</b> where the brain continues to function and the individual remains aware, although not being able to move physically, but it was stated that there was no evidence to indicate either condition: to positively diagnose akinesis with <b>mutism</b> would depend on a microscopic examination of the brain, which was not possible owing to decomposition, and transient global amnesia would leave no traces at post-mortem in any case.|$|E
25|$|Neurological {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} include cerebellar ataxia (unsteady walking with uncoordinated limb movements), dysarthria (slurred speech), dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing), tremor, epilepsy (both partial and generalized), vertical supranuclear palsy (upgaze palsy, downgaze palsy, saccadic palsy or paralysis), sleep inversion, gelastic cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone or drop attacks), dystonia (abnormal movements or postures caused by contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles across joints), most commonly begins with in turning of one foot when walking (action dystonia) and may spread to become generalized, spasticity (velocity dependent increase in muscle tone), hypotonia, ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid), microcephaly (abnormally small head), psychosis, progressive dementia, progressive hearing loss, bipolar disorder, major and psychotic depression that can include hallucinations, delusions, <b>mutism,</b> or stupor.|$|E
500|$|People with AS {{may not be}} as {{withdrawn}} around others, {{compared with}} those with other, more debilitating forms of autism; they approach others, even if awkwardly. For example, a person with AS may engage in a one-sided, long-winded speech about a favorite topic, while misunderstanding or not recognizing the listener's feelings or reactions, such as a wish to change the topic of talk or end the interaction. This social awkwardness has been called [...] "active but odd". This failure to react appropriately to social interaction may appear as disregard for other people's feelings, and may come across as insensitive. However, not all individuals with AS will approach others. Some of them may even display selective <b>mutism,</b> speaking not at all to most people and excessively to specific people. Some may choose only to talk to people they like.|$|E
2500|$|Until {{the season}} six finale, Raj's {{principal}} characteristic was {{his inability to}} speak to or around non-related women, a medical condition known as selective <b>mutism.</b> In the show this was alluded to by Dr. Beverly Hofstadter, Leonard's mother. Raj also stated he has selective <b>mutism</b> in the episode [...] "The Cornhusker Vortex". Raj was able to speak {{in the presence of}} women only when {{they were part of a}} crowd, unless he had been drinking alcoholic beverages (or thinks he has been), if he was under influence of other drugs, if he was unaware of their presence, or if the woman is deaf. He observed that this was an improvement over his previous affliction, in which the presence of women caused him to lose bladder control. He had no problem speaking to his mother, sisters, or other female relatives.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the Season 6 finale [...] "The Bon Voyage Reaction", Raj's girlfriend Lucy {{breaks up}} with him. The {{subsequent}} trauma apparently cures his <b>mutism,</b> and he finds he can talk to Penny, Amy, and Bernadette while completely sober. However, he talks so much that the women become bored and irritated and start drinking in order to put up with him.|$|E
2500|$|By mid-century, Freud's {{study had}} gained general psychoanalytic acceptance. Otto Fenichel, for example, citing her cough as {{evidence}} of identification with Frau K and her <b>mutism</b> {{as a reaction to}} the loss of Herr K. Jacques Lacan singled out for technical praise Freud's stressing of Dora's implication in [...] "the great disorder of her father's world ... she was in fact the mainspring of it".|$|E
2500|$|In the {{following}} episode, [...] "The Contractual Obligation Implementation", he takes Lucy {{out for a}} first date to a library where they text message each other instead of speaking, in light of her social anxiety and his selective <b>mutism.</b> They continue to date and by [...] "The Love Spell Potential" [...] they kiss. However, in the season 6 finale [...] "The Bon Voyage Reaction", Lucy feels too pressured by Raj to meet his friends, and a dinner between Lucy, Raj, and Amy does not go well. Raj apologizes for his behavior and asks Lucy to come to Leonard's goodbye party before his departure for the North Sea on Professor Stephen Hawking's expedition. However, Lucy text messages him at the party saying {{she will not be}} there and does not want to see him again. [...] The next day, Penny goes to comfort a heartbroken Raj, who thinks he is completely unlovable. Penny suggests that this lament is attributed to alcohol, but Raj says he that he has not had a drink since the night before: he is finally cured of his selective <b>mutism.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Raj is Howard Wolowitz's (Simon Helberg) best friend, {{with whom}} Raj shares what Nayyar calls a [...] "bromance", {{although}} {{the relationship is}} frequently made awkward by Raj's metrosexuality. Raj works as an astrophysicist in the Physics Department at Caltech. He had selective <b>mutism,</b> which did not allow him to talk to women outside of his family unless he was {{under the influence of}} alcohol (or medication), until the season 6 finale. Along with Howard, Sheldon Cooper, and Leonard Hofstadter, Raj is one of the four characters to appear in every episode of The Big Bang Theory.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{symptoms}} of blockage is headache, with other symptoms including fainting fainting dementia, and coma, all associated with obstructive hydrocephalus {{of the affected}} side or sides. Hydrocephalus can be identified by a CT scan or MRI scan of the brain, and treatment involves a neurosurgical operation in which a tiny camera and tools are used to widen the foramen or create a new opening through the septum pellucidum between the lateral ventricles. [...] If an obstructing mass is thought unsuitable for such an approach, because it is too large or too difficult to remove, an open operation or the insertion of a artificial path between the ventricles and peritoneum may be required. Because of the intimate nature of pathways within the brain, such operations may result in damage to nearby structures, with complications including anterograde amnesia, inability to move half the body, akinetic <b>mutism</b> and disconnection syndromes.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "The Grasshopper Experiment", Penny (who was {{practicing}} mixing cocktails {{in order to}} obtain a bartending shift) inadvertently discovered that Raj's <b>mutism</b> could be suppressed by consuming alcohol: even a tiny amount (such as a bite of rum cake in [...] "The Apology Insufficiency") enabled him to have prolonged conversations with women; however, this also tends to make him loud and obnoxious. When the main characters take a train to an academic conference in San Francisco, Raj can talk to series guest Summer Glau (playing herself) while drinking beer: when Leonard inadvertently discovers the beer is non-alcoholic and that Raj is under a placebo effect, Howard uses this to his advantage and Raj is returned to his usual mute self. In some episodes, Raj took to carrying a hip flask with him to counter his problem, while in other episodes that required him to speak with Penny or other women present, he was usually shown doing so with a beer or wine glass near him to indicate he had consumed alcohol (such as [...] "The Santa Simulation").|$|E
2500|$|Billy Prior [...] Prior {{is one of}} the few purely fictional {{characters}} in the book. Prior is a soldier at Craiglockhart who suffers from <b>mutism</b> and asthma. According to critic Patricia Johnson, Prior's inability to speak highlights the novel's treatment of Western culture's inability to verbalise the mutilation of bodies caused by war. Prior is a working-class officer who has risen to the rank of lieutenant despite his background. Straddling the class divide, Prior sees the British army mirroring the class system, even in the trenches. Prior often envies those who are not involved in the war experience, such as Sarah, his love interest in the novel. As he develops in the Regeneration Trilogy, the novels reveal Prior as bisexual. He is a man fundamentally at war with himself: torn between his working-class roots and his army career, between his officially acknowledged love for Sarah and his [...] "forbidden" [...] sexual attraction towards other men, between his violent father and his fussing mother, his longing for peace and his hatred of civilians unaffected by the horrors of trench warfare.|$|E
2500|$|Until {{the end of}} {{the sixth}} season, Raj {{remained}} silent when Penny was present. Penny occasionally taunted him about this, saying such things as [...] "Yo, Raj, talk to me". Raj sometimes whispered what he wanted to say to Howard or Leonard, who then repeated his words or responded to his question out loud. However, Howard sometimes used the situation to amuse himself—for example, when he [...] "confessed" [...] on Raj's behalf that Raj had stalked Penny with binoculars, or when Sheldon called Penny over to their table to silence Raj; Howard then refused to act as a mouthpiece and told Raj, [...] "No no no, he won; Suck it up." [...] In [...] "The Dumpling Paradox", Leonard jokingly suggests cutting Raj in half so the group can play video games without Howard while Penny is in the room: Raj turns to Leonard (facing away from Penny) and responds, [...] "Oh, sure, cut the foreigner in half. There's a billion more where he came from." [...] Later, in [...] "The Bat Jar Conjecture", Raj accidentally utters a few words ("good story"), much to the surprise of his friends, but he immediately realizes Penny is there and covers his mouth with both hands. A recurring gag was for Raj to find himself left alone when his friends, in the company of Penny or another woman, make plans to go somewhere and Raj's <b>mutism</b> prevents him from speaking up to join in.|$|E
5000|$|The {{conditions}} of Akinetic <b>mutism</b> and Negative symptoms are closely related. In Akinetic <b>mutism,</b> a stroke or other lesion to the {{anterior cingulate cortex}} causes reduction in movement (akinetic) and speech (<b>mutism).</b>|$|E
50|$|Akinetic <b>mutism</b> {{can also}} {{occur as a}} result of damage to the mesencephalic region of the brain. Mesencephalic akinetic <b>mutism</b> is {{clinically}} categorized as somnolent or apathetic akinetic <b>mutism.</b> It is characterized by vertical gaze palsy and ophthalmoplegia. This state of akinetic <b>mutism</b> varies in intensity, but it is distinguished by drowsiness, lack of motivation, hyper-somnolence, and reduction in spontaneous verbal and motor actions.|$|E
50|$|Selective <b>mutism</b> (SM) is a {{disorder}} {{in which a}} person who is normally capable of speech does not speak in specific situations or to specific people. Selective <b>mutism</b> usually co-exists with shyness or social anxiety. People with selective <b>mutism</b> stay silent even when the consequences of their silence include shame, social ostracism or even punishment. Selective <b>mutism</b> affects about 0.8% of people {{at some point in their}} life.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms of akinetic <b>mutism</b> {{progress}} over time. The {{occurrence of}} akinetic <b>mutism</b> takes place approximately {{four months after}} the symptoms first appear.|$|E
50|$|Akinetic <b>mutism</b> can be misdiagnosed as depression, delirium, or locked-in syndrome, all {{of which}} are common {{following}} a stroke. Patients with depression can experience apathy, slurring of speech, and body movements similar to akinetic <b>mutism.</b> Similarly to akinetic <b>mutism,</b> patients with locked-in syndrome experience paralysis and can only communicate with their eyes. Correct diagnosis is important to ensure proper treatment. A variety of treatments for akinetic <b>mutism</b> have been documented, but treatments vary between patients and cases.|$|E
50|$|Elective <b>mutism</b> {{was defined}} as a refusal to speak in almost all social {{situations}} (despite normal ability to do so), while selective <b>mutism</b> {{is considered to be a}} failure to speak in specific situations and is strongly associated with social anxiety disorder. In contrast to selective <b>mutism,</b> someone who is electively mute may not speak in any situation, as is usually shown in books and movies. Elective <b>mutism</b> is often attributed to defiance or the effect of trauma.|$|E
50|$|Subjects {{covered in}} her books include autism, Tourette syndrome, sexual abuse, fetal alcohol syndrome, and {{elective}} <b>mutism</b> (now called selective <b>mutism),</b> her specialty.|$|E
50|$|Selective <b>mutism</b> (SM) is {{an anxiety}} {{disorder}} {{in which a}} person who is normally capable of speech cannot speak in specific situations or to specific people. Selective <b>mutism</b> usually co-exists with shyness or social anxiety. People with selective <b>mutism</b> stay silent even when the consequences of their silence include shame, social ostracism or even punishment.|$|E
5000|$|In 1994, Sue Newman, {{co-founder of}} the Selective <b>Mutism</b> Foundation, {{requested}} that the fourth edition of the DSM reflect the name change from elective <b>mutism</b> to selective <b>mutism</b> and describe the disorder as a failure to speak. The relation to anxiety disorders was emphasized, particularly in the revised version (DSM IV-TR). As part of the reorganization of the DSM categories, the DSM-5 moved selective <b>mutism</b> from the section [...] "Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence" [...] to the section for anxiety disorders.|$|E
50|$|Selective <b>mutism</b> is {{strongly}} associated with other anxiety disorders, particularly social anxiety disorder. In fact, the majority of children diagnosed with selective <b>mutism</b> also have social anxiety disorder (100% of participants in two studies and 97% in another). Some researchers therefore speculate that selective <b>mutism</b> may be an avoidance strategy used by a subgroup of children with social anxiety disorder to reduce their distress in social situations.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{cause of}} both {{akinesia}} and <b>mutism</b> is ablation of the cingulate gyrus. Destruction of the cingulate gyrus {{has been used}} in the treatment of psychosis. Such lesions result in akinesia, <b>mutism,</b> apathy, and indifference to painful stimuli. The anterior cingulate cortex is thought to supply a [...] "global energizing factor" [...] that stimulates decision making. When the anterior cingulate cortex is damaged, it can result in akinetic <b>mutism.</b>|$|E
50|$|Akinetic <b>mutism</b> varies {{across all}} patients. Its form, intensity, and {{clinical}} features correspond {{more closely to}} its functional anatomy rather than to its pathology. However, akinetic <b>mutism</b> most often appears in two different forms: frontal and mesencephalic.|$|E
50|$|Selective <b>mutism</b> is a {{disorder}} that manifests {{as a child}} that does not speak {{in at least one}} social setting, despite being able to speak in other situations. Selective <b>mutism</b> is normally discovered when the child first starts school.|$|E
50|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, people with {{selective}} <b>mutism</b> {{do not necessarily}} improve with age. Effective treatment is necessary {{for a child to}} develop properly. Without treatment, selective <b>mutism</b> can contribute to chronic depression, further anxiety, and other social and emotional problems.|$|E
50|$|In {{determining}} {{a diagnosis}} between with catatonia, akinetic <b>mutism,</b> and FCMS, a person must demonstrate {{their ability to}} perform voluntary function of the limbs. Patients with catatonia or akinetic <b>mutism</b> {{are not able to}} perform voluntary commands that involve the use of limbs, while patients with FCMS still possess voluntary usage of limbs. If a person can demonstrate ability in voluntary usage of limbs, catatonia and akinetic <b>mutism</b> are most likely ruled out from the diagnosis.|$|E
