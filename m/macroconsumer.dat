40|$|The {{hydrothermal}} vents on the East Scotia Ridge are {{the first}} to be explored in the Antarctic and are dominated by large peltospiroid gastropods, stalked barnacles (Vulcanolepas sp.) and anomuran crabs (Kiwa sp.) but their food webs are unknown. Vent fluid and <b>macroconsumer</b> samples were collected at three vent sites (E 2, E 9 N and E 9 S) at distances of tens of metres to hundreds of kilometres apart with contrasting vent fluid chemistries to describe trophic interactions and identify potential carbon fixation pathways using stable isotopes. ? 13 C of dissolved inorganic carbon from vent fluids ranged from ? 4. 6 ‰ to 0. 8 ‰ at E 2 and from ? 4. 4 ‰ to 1. 5 ‰ at E 9. The lowest <b>macroconsumer</b> ? 13 C was observed in peltospiroid gastropods (? 30. 0 ‰ to ? 31. 1 ‰) and indicated carbon fixation via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle by endosymbiotic gamma-Proteobacteria. Highest ? 13 C occurred in Kiwa sp. (? 19. 0 ‰ to ? 10. 5 ‰), {{similar to that of the}} epibionts sampled from their ventral setae. Kiwa sp. ? 13 C differed among sites, which were attributed to spatial differences in the epibiont community and the relative contribution of carbon fixed via the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) and CBB cycles assimilated by Kiwa sp. Site differences in carbon fixation pathways were traced into higher trophic levels e. g. a stichasterid asteroid that predates on Kiwa sp. Sponges and anemones at the periphery of E 2 assimilated a proportion of epipelagic photosynthetic primary production but this was not observed at E 9 N. Differences in the ? 13 C and ? 34 S values of vent macroconsumers between E 2 and E 9 sites suggest the relative contributions of photosynthetic and chemoautotrophic carbon fixation (rTCA v CBB) entering the hydrothermal vent food webs vary between the sites...|$|E
40|$|Anthropogenic N {{loadings}} and perturbations of <b>macroconsumer</b> communities impair {{ecological and}} economic {{services provided by}} streams. Organisms are adapted to natural disturbances, such as flooding and desiccation, but how anthropogenic and natural disturbances interact is poorly understood. We used large outdoor mesocosms to study the effect of Campostoma anomalum, a common prairie headwater-stream minnow, and NH 4 + additions (to simulate fish excretion) on the recovery of ecosystem structure and function following a flood, highlighting the potential for Campostoma (and other macroconsumers) to affect denitrification. Campostoma and NH 4 + treatments differentially affected particulate organic matter size and filamentous algal structure. Ecosystem structure responded differently to mesocosm treatment over time, a result suggesting that grazers or NH 4 +-N availability may be especially important during early recovery periods. The presence of Campostoma did not influence denitrification, but NH 4 + additions altered the response of denitrifiers to nutrient and energy amendments, and denitrification rates decreased following the recovery of mesocosms. Temporal changes in denitrification probably were caused by increasing hyporheic dissolved O 2 concentrations, which led to potentially fewer anoxic microsites for production of denitrification enzymes. Our study shows that grazers affect the recovery of ecosystem structure, but denitrification {{in the context of}} these prairie-stream mesocosms appears to be unaffected by Campostoma...|$|E
40|$|The {{tropical}} {{rivers of}} northern Australia have received international and national recognition for their high ecological and cultural values. Unlike many tropical systems {{elsewhere in the}} world and their temperate Australian counterparts, they have largely unmodified flow regimes and are comparatively free from the impacts associated with intensive land use. However, there is growing demand for agricultural development and existing pressures, such as invasive plants and feral animals, threaten their ecological integrity. Using the international literature to provide a conceptual framework and drawing on limited published and unpublished data on rivers in northern Australia, we have derived five general principles about food webs and related ecosystem processes that both characterise tropical rivers of northern Australia and have important implications for their management. These are: (1) The seasonal hydrology is a strong driver of ecosystem processes and food web structure; (2) Hydrological connectivity is largely intact and underpins important terrestrial-aquatic food web subsidies; (3) River and wetland food webs are strongly dependent on algal production; (4) A few common <b>macroconsumer</b> species have a strong influence on benthic food webs; (5) Omnivory is widespread and food chains are short. The implications of these ecosystem attributes to the management and protection of tropical rivers and wetlands of northern Australian are discussed in relation to known threats. These principles provide a framework for the formation of testable hypotheses in future research programs. Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Migration of large-bodied 2 ̆ 7 <b>macroconsumers</b> 2 ̆ 7 (e. g., fishes, shrimps, and snails) is an {{important}} functional linkage between many tropical rivers and their estuaries. Increasingly, this linkage is being severed by darns and water abstraction. The ecological impacts of these activities are poorly understood and are largely being ignored by dam operators. We investigated the direct effects of a water intake and low-head dam on the migration of amphidromous freshwater shrimps between the headwater streams and estuary of the Rio Espiritu Santo, Puerto Rico, USA. Both downstream migratory drift of larvae and upstream migration of postlarvae had strong diel patterns, with most activity occurring at night. Unlike large dams on the island, this low-head dam did not act as a complete barrier to the upstream migration of metamorphosed postlarvae. However, the dam did cause large numbers of postlarval shrimps to accumulate directly downstream of the structure. Mortality of drifting first-stage larvae by entrainment into the water intake during downstream migration averaged 42...|$|R
30|$|Despite the {{importance}} of animal items, the prominence of vegetal component in the diet of trichodactylid crabs is indubitable. In the case of T. kensleyi, this type of food is provided mainly from allochthonous source. This fact open two main issues of discussion: {{the importance}} of this crab as shredder in subtropical streams and the effective nutrient assimilatizon of plant matter. The paucity of shredders in tropical (Dobson et al. [2002]) and subtropical (Neiff and Poi de Neiff [1990]; Ezcurra de Drago et al. [2007]) zones suggested that the leaf processing could be done by alternative decomposition pathways, such as microbial activity, which is favored by higher temperatures (Irons et al. [1994]). However, there is evidence that shredders are not scarce in these systems (Cheshire et al. [2005]) and decapod crustaceans have been reported to bear a strong impact as <b>macroconsumers</b> on the leaf detritus processing (Mancinelli and Alessandro Scalzo [2013]). In this way, T. kensleyi can {{play an important role in}} subtropical streams of southern South America influencing energy flow at multiple trophic levels.|$|R
40|$|Leaf litter {{is a major}} {{component}} in the organic matter budgets of streams worldwide. Shredding invertebrates are widely considered to be of central importance for the breakdown of allochthonous organic material in temperate-zone streams. However, various authors report an absence of this group in tropical streams. Various phenomena, including hydraulic disturbance, chemical leaf quality, and biotic control through <b>macroconsumers,</b> may cause variable shredder performance in streams. Our paper discusses the hypothesis that biogeographic distribution and the life-cycle strategies of the shredders are additional factors affecting the contribution of invertebrates to lotic decomposition processes. As a case study, we analyzed the type of organic matter inputs, the community of benthic invertebrate shredders, and the decomposition of temperate zone leaves (alder, Alnus glutinosa) in the Breitenbach (BRB), a temperate stream in Hesse, Germany, and in the Córrego Tenente Amaral (CTA), a neotropical Cerrado stream in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Quantities of natural leaf-litter inputs were comparable in the 2 systems (CTA: 820 g m - 2 y - 1, BRB: 700 g m - 2 y - 1), but the diversity of trees varied from 60 species/ha in CTA to 5 in BRB. Several shredding species were found in CTA, but in very low abundances. Larvae of the shredding calamoceratid caddisfly Phylloicus sp. were found only in lateral pools {{and not in the}} stream channel at CTA. Earlier decomposition experiments with naturally fallen native leaves did not indicate any importance of shredders at CTA, but green leaves of A. glutinosa were rapidly consumed by mining chironomids (Stenochironomus sp.). Decomposition rates were faster in CTA (–k= 0. 035 ± 0. 006) than in BRB during wintertime (0. 0095 ± 0. 0021). We conclude that detritivorous neotropical insects may have 2 different species traits. Either they have mass occurrences during short periods when their food source is available and they must be adapted to a secondary, permanently available resource on which they can survive {{for the rest of the}} time (facultative specialists), or they are restricted to the few sites that provide a permanent food source (localized specialists). Apart from these special cases, however, the community in the neotropical stream was largely composed of omnivores...|$|R
40|$|AIM: This study tested {{whether the}} <b>macroconsumer</b> Aegla longirostri {{is able to}} modify the {{invertebrate}} community associated with decomposing leaves. METHODS: The study was performed in a first-order stream located in central Rio Grande do Sul state. Two types of channels containing leaf litter of Ficus luschnathiana {{were placed in the}} stream; one type allowed aeglids to access the leaf litter (PA), and the other type did not (AA). Both types allowed aquatic insects to access the leaf litter. In addition, a control treatment (C) was established, in which no channel was used. After 3, 7, 11, 15 and 19 days, a litter bag was removed from each replicate of each treatment. RESULTS: A total of 926 organisms belonging to 19 families were identified. The most common taxon in all treatments was Chironomidae, which comprised 71 % of the total and was represented by 16 genera. The presence of aeglids decreased the total abundance of organisms by 89 % and the taxonomic richness by 35 %. The presence of A. longirostri altered the taxonomic composition of the invertebrates and the structure of the trophic groups, causing a decrease in the abundance of all groups, except for shredders and predators. The gathering-collectors trophic group was the most important (65 %), in both the presence and absence of A. longirostri. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that A. longirostri, as well as other macroconsumers, was able to modify the structure of the invertebrate community associated with decomposing leaves in the stream...|$|E
40|$|Balitoroid loaches and stream-resident gobies are {{diverse and}} {{abundant}} in tropical Asian streams, yet {{the ecology of}} these benthonic fishes is little known. I undertook a mark-recapture study {{to determine the extent}} and pattern of fish movement among stream pools, to assess the likelihood that resident fishes had persistent impacts on benthic communities. It took place in a single Hong Kong hillstream during the non-breeding period (including the entire dry season), and involved three balitoroids and a goby. The mark-recapture study was coupled with pool-scale manipulative removals of <b>macroconsumer</b> guilds (herbivorous fishes, predatory fishes and shrimp), separately and together, in three hillstreams during the dry season in order to test for top-down effects on periphyton, benthic macroinvertebrates, and leaf-litter breakdown rates. Tagging did not significantly affect the survival and growth of fishes, and recapture rates were high (58 % overall), especially for the abundant Rhinogobius duospilus (Gobiidae: 70 % of 412 tagged) and Pseudogastromyzon myersi (Balitoridae: 57 % of 762 tagged). At the end of the study, 78 % of recaptured gobies and 62 % of recaptured P. myersi remained within their initial release pools, although few moved up to 46 m and (R. duospilus) and 101 m (P. myersi) distant, giving rise to strongly leptokurtic distribution of displacements. The sedentary behaviour of all study species was more marked than has been reported for most other small benthic fishes, suggesting they have persistent ecological effects within stream pools. Among fishes that did leave their home pool, most P. myersi moved upstream whereas gobies tended to move downstream. Large adult P. myersi were highly sedentary, and individuals that travelled further showed lower growth increments. Standing stocks of herbivorous fishes (totally two species: 1. 5 - 58. 2 indiv m- 2; 1. 6 - 34. 2 g wet weight m- 2) and predatory fishes (totally four species: 7. 3 - 11. 1 indiv m- 2; 24. 1 - 38. 0 g wet weight m- 2) within pools were high, generally exceeding those reported from most other streams. Predatory palaemonid shrimp were also abundant (8. 9 - 19. 0 indiv m- 2). Despite their high densities and generally sedentary behaviour, top-down control of benthic communities by macroconsumers in all three study streams was minor to non-existent. Removal of herbivorous fishes revealed that they had a limited influence on algal biomass. Removal of predatory fishes had no effects, presumably because the remaining shrimp depleted surplus prey made available by the absence of fishes. Even removal of the entire predator guild gave rise only to a small increase in insect scrapers (mainly baetid mayflies). The abundance of most macroinvertebrate taxa, overall macroinvertebrate assemblage composition, periphyton condition (including silt accrual), and leaf-litter breakdown were unaffected by removal of either or both herbivorous and predatory <b>macroconsumer</b> guilds. The inclusion of three different study sites and the pool-scale approach, while slightly compromising within-stream replication and hence statistical power, should have provided realistic results on the importance of top-down control of stream benthic communities by macroconsumers. Given the high standing stocks of fishes and shrimp, as well as their sedentary behaviour, the small effect sizes and very weak top-down control cannot be readily explained. ipublished_or_final_versionBiological SciencesMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} new {{biological}} method {{for assessing the}} quality of lakes. It {{is based on the}} comparison of littoral and profundal macroinvertebrate communities sampled in soft sediments. Two depths were sampled: one at the littoral zone (Zl= 2 m) to define a littoral index (Bl) related to the biogenic potential of the lake (quantitative data), the other at the deep zone (Zf= 0. 66 Zmax) to define a taxonomic deficit index (Df) connected with the quality of the water-sediment interface in deep zone (qualitative data). These two indexes were combined in a Lake Biotic Index (LBI), with a range from 0 to 20, which gives an evaluation of the biogenic capacity of a lake to the development of <b>macroconsumer</b> communities. Using the Bl and Df values any lake can be plotted on a typological graph which is helpful to characterize lakes both quantitatively (oligo- to polybiotic) and qualitatively (eu- to dysbiotic). Lake Chalain (French Jura) is presented {{as an example of the}} method application with its macrofauna and the index calculation. Then, this lake was included in the typological graph with nine other French lakes studied using the same method. Each lake, characterized by its Bl, Df and LBI values, can be compared to the others in a typological scheme. The proposed indexes are discussed and bases for interpretation of the results are presented. The proposed classification of lakes gives an evaluation of their biogenic capacity concerning macroconsumers and can be usefully compared with other classifications, especially with trophic and sediment types, in functional studies as well as in lake diagnosis, in the context of the Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000 / 60 /CE) ...|$|E
40|$|Prevailing {{notions of}} foodweb {{structure}} and trophic relations in fresh waters {{are based on}} research undertaken in a limited range of latitudes or habitat types. This limitation had led to the general view that stream food webs are detritus-based with short food chains and simple interactions that often are dominated by a few key species. We used gut-content analyses and stable-isotope signatures to characterize feeding relationships and foodweb attributes of benthic communities in riffles in 2 forest streams in Hong Kong. We compared them with existing data on foodweb structure from pools in 1 of the streams and data from the literature. The 2 approaches to dietary analyses yielded complementary results, providing confidence that trophic relations and foodweb structure were adequately characterized. Food webs in both streams were remarkably similar regardless of habitat (riffle vs pool). Consumers in both streams depended primarily on autochthonous resources, as has been reported from some other tropical streams, and food chains were short although connectance was higher than has been recorded previously for stream food webs. Very few omnivores were found, and omnivory was even rarer than is typical of temperate streams, although it is common in other tropical streams and rivers. No evidence was found for dominance by a few common <b>macroconsumer</b> species, as observed elsewhere in the tropics. The apparently high levels of autochthony in tropical running waters imply that models of ecosystem functioning for northern temperate streams are inadequate for describing tropical systems. However, marked differences {{in the degree of}} omnivory and dominance of tropical stream food webs by macroconsumers is evidence that characterization of trophic interactions and stream ecosystem functioning cannot be captured by a simple tropical vs temperate dichotomy. Successful management of these systems will depend upon development of conceptual models that reflect the diversity of food webs within and between regions. © 2010 by The North American Benthological Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
