40|$|Characteristics of {{maturation}} {{and recruitment}} of the <b>sand</b> <b>smelt,</b> Atherina boyeri, from the Mala Neretva River estuary {{in the southeastern}} Adriatic, Croatia in 2001 / 2, are presented.

40|$|We used 10 {{years of}} data on clutch size, egg size and diet, and 8 years {{of data on}} timing of laying on Little Terns (Sternula albifrons) {{breeding}} in Ria Formosa lagoon system, Algarve, Portugal to assess whether diet acts as an important intermediary between climatic conditions and breeding parameters.

40|$|This study {{analysed}} the microhabitat use {{of three}} endangered fish species, Andalusian tooth- carp Aphanius baeticus, Iberian loach Cobitis paludica and <b>sand</b> <b>smelt</b> Atherina boyeri, in a coastal stream stretch. Plastic minnow traps were set both during daytime {{and at night}} {{on the bottom and}} at the surface. Depth and presence of effective refuge were recorded for each trap. To assess size-related changes in microhabitat use individuals of each species were classified in three size classes. The three species preferentially used bottom positions in the water column, though this behaviour was more evident in the case of Iberian loach. While large Iberian loach remained active at night Andalusian toothcarp and <b>sand</b> <b>smelt</b> were strongly diurnal, especially larger individuals. The three species showed a clear ontogenetic change in microhabitat pre- ferences towards deeper waters. Small Andalusian toothcarp and medium-sized Iberian loach used deeper microhabitat in the presence of refuge. Large Andalusian toothcarp consistently preferred exposed microhabitat at any time. Andalusian toothcarp using refuge were smaller at any time, while Iberian loach followed this pattern only at night. The differential vulnerability of these species to different predators (aerial and aquatic; diurnal and nocturnal) could explain the observed patterns in microhabitat use. Fish tended to co-occur in microhabitats either due to habitat characteristics independently of species or due to species independently of habitat. Andalusian toothcarp segregated spatio-temporally from <b>sand</b> <b>smelt</b> and Iberian loach, but these species occurred independently of each other. According to these co-occurrence patterns, Andalusian toothcarp would be more sensitive than Iberian loach or <b>sand</b> <b>smelt</b> to interspecificPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Enriched (δ 13 C values (annual average - 11 · 2 %) {{suggest that}} in the study site (Stagnone di Marsala, Italy) the <b>sand</b> <b>smelt</b> Atherina boyeri {{exploited}} benthic prey throughout the year. In particular, Mysidacea and Isopoda seemed to dominate the diet. Stomach content data from the literature was in partial agreement with the present isotopic analysis suggesting that, while Mysidacea and Isopoda are exploited by A. boyeri, Copepoda Harpacticoida and Amphipoda are the dominant food items of the <b>sand</b> <b>smelt</b> diet. Several hypotheses are proposed to explain such partially different results from the two techniques. Both season and size influenced the δ 13 C and δ 15 N values of A. boyeri. Although throughout the sampling year, A. boyeri showed very enriched δ 13 C and δ 15 N values consistent with a diet based on benthic resources, it showed significant seasonal differences in both nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios. Such a finding suggests that the food preferences of A. boyeri undergo small seasonal differences, probably {{as a consequence of}} prey availability. Size also affected the isotopic composition of the sand-smelt indicating that this species shows ontogenetic diet shifts in the study site. Compared with other Mediterranean trophic data of the <b>sand</b> <b>smelt</b> these results substantiate the great adaptability of A. boyeri to the local environmental resources and its trophic plasticity. © 2002 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

40|$|The feeding {{ecology of}} the <b>sand</b> <b>smelt</b> Atherina boyeri Risso 1810 (Osteichthyes, Atherinidae) was {{investigated}} in a Mediterranean coastal basin (Stagnone di Marsala, Italy) by means of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios. Sampling was carried out seasonally in 1999 in two locations characterised by different depth and vegetal coverage. Throughout the year the <b>sand</b> <b>smelt</b> showed enriched d 13 C and d 15 N values in both sampling locations (d 13 C about) 12 & and d 15 N about 12 &). This result suggests the overall importance of the benthic pathway in the food web leading to A. boyeri. Our isotopic picture is only in partial agreement with stomach content data from the literature. Stomach contents highlighted that, while A. boyeri is benthivore in the location with high vegetal coverage, {{it is able to}} shift its diet toward zooplankton in the location with higher depth and lower complexity. In our opinion, this discrepancy can be a consequence of the different temporal scale which stomach contents and stable isotopes are referred to. Contrarily to stomach contents, stable isotope analysis provides time-integrated information on the real diet averaged over some months or more. We suggest that long-term and short-term diets of the <b>sand</b> <b>smelt</b> differ. Zooplankton, due to its low biomass in the study site seems to be exploited scarcely by A. boyeri and its trophic role is detectable only considering the short term diet with stomach contents, while the timeintegrated diet of A. boyeri seems to be based on benthic prey...|$|R

40|$|The big-scale <b>sand</b> <b>smelt</b> Atherina boyeri {{lives in}} fresh water, {{brackish}} water and sea {{water of the}} western Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Previous studies concerning distribution, biometric characters and genetic molecular markers have suggested the possible existence of two or even three different groups or species of <b>sand</b> <b>smelt,</b> one ‘lagoon’ type and one (or two – punctuated and non-punctuated on the flanks) ‘marine’ type. In this study, the presence and the localization of an insertion was described, c. 200 bp in length, in the mtDNA of the lagoon and marine punctuated specimens of A. boyeri and its absence in the marine non-punctuated specimens, {{as well as in}} other two congeneric species, Atherina hepsetus and Atherina presbyter, and in the atheriniform Menidia menidia. The intergenic spacer is located between the tRNAGlu and cytochrome b (cyt b) genes and shares a c. 50 % sequence similarity with cyt b.

Over 97 % of captured fish were Andalusian toothcarp (Aphanius baeticus), Iberian loach (Cobitis paludica) and <b>sand</b> <b>smelt</b> (Atherina boyeri). F 1 was the most efficient trap type in capturing the three most abundant species. Catches by PM and F 2 differed in taxonomic composition, the former being characterised by toothcarp and loach dominance and the latter by the catch of eel (Anguilla anguilla) and grey mullets (Fam.
