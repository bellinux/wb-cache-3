5|$|Salkin {{had noted}} that its {{tropical}} position <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> that B.dentata {{was a key}} species in the transition from rainforest to open habitat in the ancestry of the genus. One adaptation to a drier sunnier climate was a thick intermediate layer under the epidermis in the leaf architecture. This layer, the hypodermis, contains large vacuoles that are filled with a phenolic compound, and seems to serve to reduce the intensity of sunlight reaching the mesophyll.|$|E
5|$|Mauretania was {{a client}} kingdom of Rome ruled by Ptolemy of Mauretania. Caligula invited Ptolemy to Rome and then {{suddenly}} had him executed. Mauretania was annexed by Caligula and subsequently divided into two provinces, Mauretania Tingitana and Mauretania Caesariensis, separated by the river Malua. Pliny claims that division {{was the work of}} Caligula, but Dio states that in AD 42 an uprising took place, which was subdued by Gaius Suetonius Paulinus and Gnaeus Hosidius Geta, and the division only took place after this. This confusion <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> that Caligula decided to divide the province, but the division was postponed because of the rebellion. The first known equestrian governor of the two provinces was Marcus Fadius Celer Flavianus, in office in AD 44.|$|E
5|$|The RF {{claimed that}} the bloody civil wars, {{military}} coups and other disasters that plagued the new majority-ruled African states to the north, many of which had become corrupt, autocratic or communist one-party states very soon after independence, showed that black nationalist leaders were not ready to govern. Influenced strongly by the white refugees who had fled south from the Congo, it presented chaotic doomsday scenarios of what black nationalist rule in Southern Rhodesia <b>might</b> <b>mean,</b> particularly for the white community. Proponents of the RF stand downplayed black nationalist grievances regarding land ownership and segregation, and argued that despite the racial imbalance in domestic politics—whites made up 5% of the population, but over 90% of registered voters—the electoral system was not racist as the franchise was based on financial and educational qualifications rather than ethnicity. They emphasised the colony's proud war record on Britain's behalf, and expressed a wish in the Cold War context to form an anti-communist, pro-Western front in Africa alongside South Africa and Portugal.|$|E

40|$|What role do {{search engines}} play for {{ordinary}} people using the Web? What {{does it mean}} to suggest, as some have done 1, to say that search engines are biased? <b>Might</b> it <b>mean</b> that their whole access to the Internet is somehow fundamentally compromised? Or, on the other hand, <b>might</b> it <b>mean</b> very little to the average user...|$|R
5000|$|Institutional framework: the {{institutional}} constraints governing economic interactions must be specified. In many DSGE models, this <b>might</b> just <b>mean</b> that agents must obey some exogenously imposed budget constraints, and that prices {{are assumed to}} adjust until markets clear. It <b>might</b> also <b>mean</b> specifying the rules of monetary and fiscal policy, or even how policy rules and budget constraints change depending on a political process.|$|R
5|$|R.C. MacLeod listed another tradition, {{somewhat}} {{similar to the}} one that appeared in c.1800 manuscript. According to this version, a MacLeod joined a Crusading army, and went to the Holy Land. While in the desert-wilderness, he came across a witch, from whom he managed to escape. He then came upon a river, and proceeded to cross it at a ford. However, a fairy maiden appeared from the water and blocked his passage. After a struggle, MacLeod overcame the fairy and passed over the river. He then became friends with her. Before they parted, the fairy maiden gave him a box of scented wood; this box, she told him, held several other smaller boxes, which fitted inside one another. She told him that the innermost box contained a magic banner, which when waved would bring forth a host of armed men to aid its owner. The fairy warned the MacLeod, that if he were to open the box within a year and a day from then, that no crops would grow on his land, no livestock would be born, as well as no children. When the MacLeod returned home he gave the box to the chief's wife. The wife, however, ignored the MacLeod's warning, and opened the box. Immediately a host of armed men appeared and that year, no children were born. The tradition concluded that ever since that time, the flag had been preserved for a time when such an army <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> salvation for the clan.|$|E
25|$|An {{increase}} in diagnoses <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> that HIV testing {{has become more}} easily available than in preceding years, or that the stigma associated with HIV has declined, encouraging more to get tested.|$|E
25|$|This <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> that he sailed {{off from}} Hamburg or Bremen instead of some port in Baltic Sea, since the later account by Adam of Bremen gives the {{distance}} of Scania and Birka to be only 5 days at sea.|$|E

25|$|With Lou Harrison...being gay is {{something}} affirmative.

25|$|Lebanese Protestant scholar Kamal Salibi (1929–2011) {{observes that}} , which {{literally}} does mean tenth, might more loosely {{be used to}} mean portion, and , or from all, might refer just to food in the giver's possession, so that the whole verse <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> He gave him a portion of food..|$|E
25|$|Continuing {{effects of}} the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the {{beginning}} of the Great Depression led the Rosenwald Fund to withdraw its offer of funding.

25|$|Working with {{barbed wire}} was a nasty job under any circumstances, {{but when you}} were {{handling}} it {{in the dark and}} within a hundred yards of rifles and machine guns that would shoot at the least sound, you were doing one of the most nerve-wracking bits of work that could possibly be imagined...the slightest move <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> death for half your party.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of emails, IMs and other electronic messaging means that paper documents of family history {{are no longer}} regularly generated. Seldom is electronic communication printed out for the family files. The 19th and 20th centuries, providing access both to widespread literacy and to resources to create and preserve paper documents <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> that these forms of family history and lore are themselves becoming history.|$|E
25|$|Various {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} to explain the short stature of pygmies. Evidence of heritability has been established which may have evolved as an adaptation to low ultraviolet light levels in rainforests. This <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> that relatively little vitamin D {{can be made in}} human skin, thereby limiting calcium uptake from the diet for bone growth and maintenance, and leading to the evolution of the small skeletal size characteristic of pygmies.|$|E
50|$|This theory, however, was criticised by Pierre Thillet in 1984. Thillet {{argued that}} the text that refers to Aristotle as Alexander's teacher <b>might</b> merely <b>mean</b> that Alexander learned from the {{writings}} of the famous Aristotle.|$|R

25|$|In a 2015 {{retrospective}} on Kuhn, {{the philosopher}} Martin Cohen describes {{the notion of}} the ‘Paradigm Shift’ as a kind of intellectual virus – spreading from hard science to social science and on to the arts and even everyday political rhetoric today. Cohen claims that Thomas Kuhn himself had only a very hazy idea of what it <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> and, in line with the American philosopher of science, Paul Feyerabend, accuses Kuhn of retreating from the more radical implications of his theory, which are that scientific facts are never really more than opinions, whose popularity is transitory and far from conclusive.|$|E
25|$|Other {{important}} criteria {{throughout history}} are that great powers should have enough influence {{to be included}} in discussions of political and diplomatic questions of the day, and have influence on the final outcome and resolution. Historically, when major political questions were addressed, several great powers met to discuss them. Before the era of groups like the United Nations, participants of such meetings were not officially named, but were decided based on their great power status. These were conferences which settled important questions based on major historical events. This <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> deciding the political resolution of various geographical and nationalist claims following a major conflict, or other contexts.|$|E
5000|$|Eyvindr drew {{heavily on}} earlier poetry in his works. The cognomen skáldaspillir means {{literally}} [...] "spoiler of poets" [...] and is sometimes translated as [...] "plagiarist", though it <b>might</b> also <b>mean</b> {{that he was}} {{better than any other}} poet.|$|R

25|$|Liberman et al. {{found that}} no 4-year-olds and only 17% of 5-year-olds {{were able to}} tap out the number of phonemes (individual sounds) in a word. 70% of 6-year-olds {{were able to do}} so. This <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> that {{children}} are aware of syllables as units of speech early on, while they don’t show awareness of individual phonemes until school age. Another explanation is that individual sounds do not easily translate into beats, which makes clapping individual phonemes a much more difficult task than clapping syllables. One reason why phoneme awareness gets much better once children start school is because learning to read provides a visual aid as how to break up words into their smaller constituents.|$|E
25|$|According to Rawlinson B 502, Dáire Cerbba {{was born}} in Brega, County Meath, but no {{explanation}} is given. This <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> his family were even later arrivals to Munster than the Eóganachta and help explain their lack of centralization and well known colonies in Britain. The Uí Fidgenti (NW) and Uí Liatháin (SE) were in opposing corners of Munster with the Eóganacht Áine and Eóganacht Glendamnach {{more or less in}} between, as well as the Fir Mag Fene. Brega bordered on the territory of the Laigin, and was originally a part of it. Against this {{is the fact that the}} Uí Fidgenti had their own capital at Dún Eochair in Munster, constructed by the Dáirine several centuries before the rise of Cashel, as described by Geoffrey Keating.|$|E
25|$|After {{celebrating the}} birth of his son, the first child with Morgan Beck, Miller {{announced}} in October, that he would skip another season with the intention {{to spend more time with}} his family and to focus on his new-found passion of horse training. Even though some people started to suspect that this <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> the end of his skiing career, Miller denied it in December stating that although he would never do the full circuit again, there's a likelihood that he'd return to racing occasionally. He terminated his contract with HEAD early under the restriction to not compete with other skis than HEAD in the World Cup circuit or World Alpine Ski Championships. He was then able to sign a deal with US-based ski manufacturer Bomber Ski, which also made Miller the brand's part owner.|$|E
