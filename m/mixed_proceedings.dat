6000|$|It {{has renewed}} itself, however, {{but too much}} on this spot, and the scene viewed from Ashburton Place claims at the best more filling in than I can give it. Any {{illustration}} of anything worth illustrating has beauty, to my vision, largely by its developments; and developments, alas, are the whole flowering of the plant, while what really meets such attention as one may hope to beguile is at the best but a plucked and tossed sprig or two. That my elder brother was during these months away with Professor Agassiz, {{a member of the}} party recruited by that great naturalist for a prolonged exploration of Brazil, {{is one of the few}} blooms, I see, that I must content myself with detaching--the main sense of it being for myself, no doubt, that his absence (and he had never been at anything like such a distance from us,) left me the more exposed, and thereby the more responsive, to contact with impressions that had to learn to suffice for me in their uncorrected, when not still more in their inspiringly emphasised, state. The main sense for William himself is recorded in a series of letters from him addressed to us at home and for which, against my hope, these pages succeed in affording no space--they are to have ampler presentation; but the arrival of which at irregular intervals for the greater part of a year comes back to me as perhaps a fuller enrichment of my consciousness than it owed for the time to any other single source. We all still hung so together that this replete organ could yet go on helping itself, with whatever awkwardness, from the conception or projection of others of a like general strain, such as those of one's brothers might appear; thanks to which constant hum of borrowed experience, in addition to the quicker play of whatever could pass as more honestly earned, my stage of life knew no drop of the curtain. I literally came and went, I had never practised such coming and going; I went in particular, during summer weeks, and even if carrying my general difficulty with me, to the White Mountains of New Hampshire, with some repetition, and again and again back to Newport, on visits to John La Farge and to the Edmund Tweedys (their house almost a second summer home to us;) to say nothing of winter attempts, a little weak, but still more or less achieved, upon New York--which city was rapidly taking on the capital quality, the large worldly sense that dear old London and dear old Paris, with other matters in hand for them as time went on, the time they were [...] "biding" [...] for me, indulgently didn't grudge it. The matters they had in hand wandered indeed as stray vague airs across to us--this I think I have noted; but Boston itself could easily rule, in default even of New York, when to [...] "go," [...] in particular, was an act of such easy virtue. To go from Ashburton Place was to go verily round the corner not less than further afield; to go to the Athenæum, to the Museum, to a certain door of importances, in fact of immensities, defiant of vulgar notation, in Charles Street, at the opposite end from Beacon. The fruit of these <b>mixed</b> <b>proceedings</b> I found abundant at the time, and I think quite inveterately sweet, but to gather it in again now--by which I mean set it forth as a banquet for imaginations already provided--would be to presume too far; not least indeed even on my own cultivated art of exhibition. The fruit of golden youth is all and always golden--it touches to gold what it gathers; this was so the essence of the case that in the first place everything was in some degree an adventure, and in the second any differences of degree guiding my selection would be imperceptible at this end of time to the cold eye of criticism. Not least moreover in the third place the very terms would fail, under whatever ingenuity, for my really justifying so bland an account of the period at large. Do I speak of it as a thumping sum but to show it in the small change, the handful of separate copper and silver coin, the scattered occasions reduced to their individual cash value, that, spread upon the table as a treasure of reminiscence, might only excite derision? Why was [...] "staying at Newport" [...] so absurdly, insistently romantic, romantic out of all proportion, as we say--why unless I can truly tell in proportion to what it became so? It consisted often in my [...] "sitting" [...] to John La Farge, within his own precincts and in the open air of attenuated summer days, and lounging thereby just passive to the surge of culture that broke upon me in waves the most desultory and disjointed, it was true, but to an absolute effect of unceasingly scented spray. Particular hours and old (that is young!) ineffable reactions come back to me; it's like putting one's ear, doctor-fashion, to the breast of time--or say as the subtle savage puts his to the ground--and catching at its start some vibratory hum that has been going on more or less for the fifty years since. Newport, the barren isle of our return from Europe, had thus become--and at no such great expense if the shock of public affairs, everywhere making interests start to their feet, be counted out of the process--a source of fifty suggestions to me; which it would have been much less, however, I hasten to add, if the call of La Farge hadn't worked in with our other most standing attraction, and this in turn hadn't practically been part of the positive affluence of certain elements of spectacle. Why again I should have been able to see the pictorial so freely suggested, that pictorial which was ever for me the dramatic, the social, the effectively human aspect, would be doubtless a baffling inquiry in presence of the queer and dear old phenomena themselves; those that, taken together, may be described at the best, I suppose, rather as a much-mixed grope or halting struggle, call it even a competitive scramble, toward the larger, the ideal elegance, the traditional forms of good society in possession, than as a presentation of great noble assurances.|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of mixed administrative processes from a phenomenological and morphological {{point of view}} allows, first, their common feature to be identified— namely, the structural element deriving from the involvement of both Community administrations (in the strict sense) and national ones in the various stages of a proceeding. The structural element {{is at the same}} time a distinctive one in the sense that it differentiates mixed processes from other types. Accordingly, the notion of <b>mixed</b> administrative <b>proceedings</b> has a cognitive value. However, its importance is limited insofar as there are no rules or remedies that are characteristic of and exclusive to this type of process. In other words, it does not have its own legal framework, distinct from that of the entire universe of European administration. The notion is nevertheless useful, not only for referring to a distinct group of proceedings, but also for signaling that the corresponding legal regime presents imperfections, giving rise to the need for a set of rules capable of altering or perfecting the current rules...|$|R

The final two of eight antineutrino detectors were {{installed in the}} summer of 2012.

40|$|Confidentiality is {{unanimously}} recognized {{to be one}} of {{the most}} characteristic and attractive features of international commercial arbitration. The confidential character of arbitral proceedings has often been presumed on the basis of the privacy of the hearings, but this presumption has proven ill-founded in arbitrations between private and public actors ("mixed arbitration"). National courts and international tribunals have come to recognize and to enforce a public interest exception to confidentiality based on the principle that the public has a right to be informed of the contents and outcome of the arbitral proceedings whenever the subject-matter of the dispute is of public concern. This thesis will assess the basis upon which and the limits within which the public interest exception to confidentiality might operate. The thesis will then provide an analysis of the benefits—the accommodation of moral and legal expectations of public participation—and risks—the politicization of the arbitrated dispute and disclosure of trade secrets—of greater transparency and openness in <b>mixed</b> arbitral <b>proceedings.</b> The thesis will show that the public interest exception to confidentiality is a valuable and important development along the path of democratic governance, but also that, in order to avoid the indiscriminate disclosure of information, the precise range of its application needs to be carefully defined and limited to only those cases wherein it appears to be fully justified...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the existence of}} strategic solutions to finite normal form games {{under the assumption that}} strategy choices can be described as choices among lotteries where players have security- and potential level preferences over lotteries (e. g., Cohen, Theory and Decision, 33, 101 – 104, 1992, Gilboa, Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 32, 405 – 420, 1988, Jaffray, Theory and Decision, 24, 169 – 200, 1988). Since security- and potential level preferences require discontinuous utility representations, standard existence results for Nash equilibria in <b>mixed</b> strategies (Nash, <b>Proceedings</b> of the National Academy of Sciences, 36, 48 – 49, 1950 a, Non-Cooperative Games, Ph. D. Dissertation, Princeton University Press, 1950 b) or for equilibria in beliefs (Crawford, Journal of Economic Theory, 50, 127 – 154, 1990) do not apply. As a key insight this paper proves that non-existence of equilibria in beliefs, and therefore non-existence of Nash equilibria in mixed strategies, is possible in finite games with security- and potential level players. But, as this paper also shows, rationalizable strategies (Bernheim, Econometrica, 52, 1007 – 1028, 1984, Moulin, Mathematical Social Sciences, 7, 83 – 102, 1984, Pearce, Econometrica, 52, 1029 – 1050, 1984) exist for such games.

Improvements to the baseline jet mixer pump technology are sought because jet mixer pumps have moving parts that may fail or require maintenance. Moreover, jet mixers are relatively expensive, they heat the waste, and, in some cases, may not mobilize {{enough of the}} sludge. This report documents a thorough literature search for commercially available applicable mixing technologies {{that could be used}} for double-shell tank sludge mobilization and mixing. Textbooks, research articles, conference <b>proceedings,</b> <b>mixing</b> experts, and the Thomas Register were consulted to identify applicable technologies. While there are many commercial methods that could be used to mobilize sludge or mix the contents of a one-million gallon tank, few will work given the geometrical constraints (e. g., the mixer must fit through a 1. 07 -m-diameter riser) or the tank waste properties (e. g., the sludge has such a high yield stress that it generally does not flow under its own weight). Pulsed fluid jets and submersible Flygt mixers have already been identified at Hanford and Savannah River Sites for double-shell tank mixing applications. While these mixing technologies may not be applicable for double-shell tanks that have a thick sludge layer at the bottom (since too many of these mixers would need to be installed to mobilize most of the sludge), they may have applications in tanks that do not have a settled solids layer. Retrieval projects at Hanford and other U. S. Department of Energy sites are currently evaluating the effectiveness of these mixing techniques for tank waste applications.
