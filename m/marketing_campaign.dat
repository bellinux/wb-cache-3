40|$|In {{the present}} work, we study the {{advertising}} competition of several <b>marketing</b> <b>campaigns</b> {{who need to}} determine how many resources to allocate to potential customers to advertise their products through direct marketing while taking into account that competing <b>marketing</b> <b>campaigns</b> are trying to do the same. Potential customers rank <b>marketing</b> <b>campaigns</b> according to the offers, promotions or discounts made to them. Taking into account the intrinsic value of potential customers as well as the peer influence that they exert over other potential customers we consider the network value as a measure of their importance in the market and we find an analytical expression for it. We analyze the <b>marketing</b> <b>campaigns</b> competition from a game theory point of view, finding a closed form expression of the symmetric equilibrium offer strategy for the <b>marketing</b> <b>campaigns</b> from which no campaign has any incentive to deviate. We also present several scenarios, such as Winner-takes-all and Borda, but not the only possible ones for which our results allow us to retrieve in a simple way the corresponding equilibrium strategy...|$|R
