50|$|Milgrom made a {{fundamental}} {{contribution to the}} theory of repeated games. When players’ actions are hidden and noisy signals about their actions are observable (i.e., in the case of imperfect monitoring), there are two general ways to achieve efficiency. One way is to transfer future payoffs from one player to others. This is a way to punish a potential deviator without reducing the total future payoffs. The classical folk theorem result under imperfect monitoring is built on this idea. The second general method is to delay the release of information. Under the second method, the outcomes of the noisy signals are released in every T periods, and upon the release of information players “review” the signals in the last T periods and decide to push or reward each other. This is now widely known as the “review strategy”, and Milgrom’s paper with D. Abreu and D. Pearce (Abreu, Milgrom and Pearce, 1991) was the first to show the efficiency of review strategy equilibrium in discounted repeated games. The review strategy turns out to be useful when players receive private signals about each other’s actions (the case of private monitoring), and the folk theorem for the private <b>monitoring</b> <b>case</b> is built on the idea of the review strategy.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical {{foundation of the}} possibility that multimarket contact enhances firms' abilities to sustain implicit collusion. When firms operate in a single market and cannot perfectly monitor the opponents' choices of supply, it is impossible to achieve efficiency among these firms in a self-enforcing way, even though these firms have the long-term strategic relationship. By using models of infinitely repeated game with discounting, we shows that when firms encounter each other in a number of distinct markets and the degree of multimarket contact is large enough, efficiency can be approximately sustained by a subgame perfect equilibrium. This efficiency theorem in the imperfect <b>monitoring</b> <b>case</b> holds under almost the same condition on the discount factor as the perfect <b>monitoring</b> <b>case.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|The {{model of}} a non-Bayesian agent who faces a {{repeated}} game with incomplete information against Nature is an appropriate tool for modeling general agent-environment interactions. In such a model the environment state (controlled by Nature) may change arbitrarily, and the feedback/reward function is initially unknown. The agent is not Bayesian, that is he does not form a prior probability neither on the state selection strategy of Nature, nor on his reward function. A policy for the agent is a function which assigns an action to every history of observations and actions. Two basic feedback structures are considered. In one of them [...] the perfect <b>monitoring</b> <b>case</b> [...] the agent is able to observe the previous environment state {{as part of his}} feedback, while in the other [...] the imperfect <b>monitoring</b> <b>case</b> [...] all that is available to the agent is the reward obtained.

40|$|This paper investigates general two-player {{infinitely}} repeated games {{where the}} discount factor {{is less than}} but close to unity. We assume that monitoring is imperfect and private, and players' private signals are correlated through the unobservable macro shock. We show that a sequential equilibrium payoff vector approximates efficiency in a wide class of environments when {{the size of the}} set of private signals for each player is sufficiently large in comparison with the size of the set of possible macro shocks as well as the size of the set of actions for the opponent. We require almost no condition on the accuracy of players' monitoring technology. We argue that the use of review strategy works very well in the private <b>monitoring</b> <b>case,</b> although it does not work well in the public <b>monitoring</b> <b>case.</b> We apply our efficiency result to a model of price-setting duopoly a la Stigler (1964), where each firm's price choice is unobservable to its rival firm and the sales level for each firm is regarded as its private signal. Contrarily to Stigler's conjecture, the full cartel collusion can be self-enforcing even if firms cannot communicate and have the option of making secret price cuts. ...|$|E

30|$|Comprehensive {{analysis}} of uncharacterized but biologically active mixtures of organic contaminants requires additional effect-based approaches {{to be adopted}} for analyzing enriched water samples, as a complement to chemical analysis [25, 27]. We developed a systematic approach for capturing anticipated effects from such complex chemical mixtures. First, we compiled lists of water contaminants found in monitoring studies and translated these into mode-of-action (MoA) categories [15]. These MoAs were then used to devise panels of bioassays designed to comprehensively capture biological effects of chemicals expected in water [1, 23]. Subsequently, bioassay panels were applied to single water contaminants to test the MoA categorizations [48, 49], as well as mixture effect recovery in complex contaminated samples [2] and in various <b>monitoring</b> <b>case</b> studies [38, 47, 49, 52, 65].|$|E
