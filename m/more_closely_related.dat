5|$|The {{findings}} indicate that based on mitochondrial DNA, common ravens {{from the rest of}} the United States are <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to those in Europe and Asia than to those in the California clade, and that common ravens in the California clade are <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to the Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) than to those in the Holarctic clade. Ravens in the Holarctic clade are <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to the pied crow (C. albus) than they are to the California clade. Thus, the common raven species as traditionally delimited is considered to be paraphyletic.|$|E
5|$|Analyses since 2001 have {{concluded}} that Eumetazoa (more complex than sponges) are <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to particular groups of sponges than {{to the rest of}} the sponges. Such conclusions imply that sponges are not monophyletic, because the last common ancestor of all sponges would also be a direct ancestor of the Eumetazoa, which are not sponges. A study in 2001 based on comparisons of ribosome DNA concluded that the most fundamental division within sponges was between glass sponges and the rest, and that Eumetazoa are <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to calcareous sponges, those with calcium carbonate spicules, than to other types of sponge. In 2007 one analysis based on comparisons of RNA and another based mainly on comparison of spicules concluded that demosponges and glass sponges are <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to each other than either is to calcareous sponges, which in turn are <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to Eumetazoa.|$|E
5|$|Megalodon is now {{considered}} {{to be a member of}} the family Otodontidae, genus Carcharocles, as opposed to it previous classification into Lamnidae, genus Carcharodon. Megalodon's classification into Carcharodon was due to dental similarity with the great white shark, but most authors currently believe that this is due to convergent evolution. In this model, the great white shark is <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to the shark Isurus hastalis than to megalodon, as evidenced by more similar dentition in those two sharks; megalodon teeth have much finer serrations than great white shark teeth. The great white shark is <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to the mako shark (Isurus spp.), with a common ancestor around 4 mya. However, proponents of the former model, wherein megalodon and the great white shark are <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related,</b> argue that the differences between their dentition are minute and obscure.|$|E

5|$|More recently, a 2007 {{analysis}} by paleontologist William G. Parker {{resulted in a}} larger tree of aetosaur phylogenetics with the inclusion of Heliocanthus. Based on the tree, Parker defined the clades Typothoracisinae and Paratypothoracisini, both within Aetosaurinae. Parker also gave a revised phylogenetic definition of Aetosauria, mentioning that the previous definition, made by Heckert and Lucas in 2000, was somewhat ambiguous. Heckert & Lucas (2000) defined Aetosauria as a stem-based taxon, claiming that Aetosauria included all crurotarsans that were <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to Desmatosuchus than to the immediate sister group of Aetosauria. Because the immediate sister group of Aetosauria was uncertain, Parker offered a new definition with several non-aetosaur crurotarsan genera rather than one sister group. According to Parker, Aetosauria included all taxa <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to Aetosaurus and Desmatosuchus than to Leptosuchus, Postosuchus, Prestosuchus, Poposaurus, Sphenosuchus, Alligator, Gracilisuchus, and Revueltosaurus.|$|E
