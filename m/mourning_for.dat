He wore <b>mourning</b> <b>for</b> {{about six months}} but, as was within custom, {{did not attend the}} funeral, where Lady Dudley's half-brothers, neighbours, as well as city and county {{prominence}} played the leading parts. The court went into <b>mourning</b> <b>for</b> over a month; Robert Dudley retired to his house at Kew.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{speculative}} theories on the origin of the Brunswickers' dark and seemingly grim choice of garb. It has been suggested that black was chosen to mourn Duke Frederick William's late father; as a sign of respect for the Duke; or in <b>mourning</b> <b>for</b> the Duke's occupied homeland. Colonel Augustus Frazer, who had served alongside the Brunswickers, reported that black was adopted in <b>mourning</b> <b>for</b> the Duke's wife, Princess Marie of Baden, who had died in 1808, and that the black uniforms would not be put aside until Brunswick had been finally liberated.|$|E

60|$|If my grief were selfish, I did {{not know}} it to be so. I <b>mourned</b> <b>for</b> my child-wife, taken from her {{blooming}} world, so young. I <b>mourned</b> <b>for</b> him who might have won the love and admiration of thousands, as he had won mine long ago. I <b>mourned</b> <b>for</b> the broken heart that had found rest in the stormy sea; and for the wandering remnants of the simple home, where I had heard the night-wind blowing, when I was a child.|$|R
5|$|Dressed in <b>mourning</b> <b>for</b> the {{remainder}} of her life, Queen Mary's first act as regent was to disseminate a manifesto, outlining James Francis Edward's claims. It was largely ignored in England. In Scotland, however, the confederate Lords sent Lord Belhaven to Saint-Germain, to convince the Queen to surrender to them custody of James Francis Edward and accede to his conversion to Protestantism.|$|E
5|$|Lucy only {{appears in}} the second half of the poem, where she is linked with the English landscape. As such, it seems as if nature joins with the narrator in <b>mourning</b> <b>for</b> her, and the reader is drawn into this mutual sorrow.|$|E
5|$|Strict {{orthodox}} Judaism forbids {{men from}} cutting their sidelocks, but other hair may be kept as desired. Hair is not cut {{during a time}} of mourning. The Torah in Deuteronomy 14:1 prohibits removing hair in <b>mourning</b> <b>for</b> the dead.|$|E

25|$|In a concubinage situation, a {{concubine}} {{was only}} required to <b>mourn</b> <b>for</b> her husband, his wife, his parents, {{and all his}} children including her own, whereas a wife was required to <b>mourn</b> <b>for</b> almost all of her husband's near relatives.

5|$|Dreadnought was christened with {{a bottle}} of Australian wine by King Edward VII on 10 February 1906, after only four months on the ways. The bottle {{required}} multiple blows to shatter on a bow that later became famous. Signifying the ship's importance the launch had been planned to be a large elaborate festive event, however as the court was still in <b>mourning</b> <b>for</b> Queen Alexandra's father who had died twelve days before, she did not attend and a more sober event occurred.|$|E
5|$|On October 25, 1973, Abebe died in Addis Ababa at age 41 of a {{cerebral}} hemorrhage, a complication {{related to}} his accident four years earlier. He was buried with full military honours; his state funeral was attended by an estimated 65,000 people including Haile Selassie, who proclaimed a day of <b>mourning</b> <b>for</b> the country's national hero. Abebe was interred in a tomb with a bronze statue at Saint Joseph Church in Addis Ababa.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months after}} Alfred's death, Octavius and Sophia {{were taken to}} Kew Palace in London to be inoculated with the {{smallpox}} virus. While Sophia recovered without incident, Octavius became ill and died several days later, around 8 o'clock PM, on 3 May 1783, at Kew Palace. He was four years old. As was traditional, the household did not go into <b>mourning</b> <b>for</b> the deaths of royal {{children under the age}} of fourteen.|$|E

5|$|The Government of Finland held {{a crisis}} meeting, and {{declared}} a national day of <b>mourning</b> <b>for</b> September 24, with ministers agreeing that Finland's laws pertaining to gun ownership should be reviewed. Suggestions included introducing legislation to aid {{police officers in}} accessing information about the {{mental and physical health}} of applicants for firearms licenses, and the right to request further information if the applicant had a history of using medication. The question whether or not private persons should be allowed to own handguns was also raised.|$|E
5|$|The {{explosion}} occurred {{shortly before}} the primary 2013 Argentine legislative elections on August 11. The governor of Santa Fe province, Antonio Bonfatti, asked the political parties to end their campaigns to allow <b>mourning</b> <b>for</b> {{the victims of the}} explosion. The Front for Victory and Progressive, Civic and Social Front candidates suspended their campaigns, and the national government declared two days of mourning. The period of mourning was observed by all candidates in Buenos Aires and most other provinces, who ended their political campaigns.|$|E
5|$|All {{that changed}} with the {{assassination}} of Tsar Alexander II. The <b>mourning</b> <b>for</b> the tsar meant {{there would be no}} performances in the capital; in addition the political climate of Russia turned sharply against the Jews. Goldfaden's troupe soldiered on for a time—to Minsk, to Bobruisk where they played mainly to Russian soldiers, and to Vitebsk, where he and Sonya ended up having to sue Goldfaden for their pay, and left to rejoin Rosenberg, who was playing in a tent theater in Nezhin. However, matters there proved even worse: Nezhin soon fell prey to a pogrom. The troupe managed to avoid bodily harm, partly by convincing the rioters that they were a French theater troupe and partly by making judicious use of the money the Adlers had won in court from Goldfaden.|$|E

5|$|Louise's father, Prince Albert, died at Windsor on 14 December 1861. The Queen was devastated, {{and ordered}} her {{household}} {{to move from}} Windsor to Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. The atmosphere of the royal court became gloomy and morbid {{in the wake of}} the Prince's death, and entertainments became dry and dull. Louise quickly became dissatisfied with her mother's prolonged <b>mourning.</b> <b>For</b> her seventeenth birthday in 1865, Louise requested the ballroom to be opened for a debutante dance, the like of which had not been performed since Prince Albert's death. Her request was refused, and her boredom with the mundane routine of travelling between the different royal residences at set times irritated her mother, who considered Louise to be indiscreet and argumentative.|$|E
5|$|Mona Lisa {{fulfilled}} 15th- {{and early}} 16th century requirements for portraying {{a woman of}} virtue. Lisa is portrayed as a faithful wife through gesture—her right hand rests over her left. Leonardo also presented Lisa as fashionable and successful, perhaps more well-off than she was. Her dark garments and black veil were Spanish-influenced high fashion; {{they are not a}} depiction of <b>mourning</b> <b>for</b> her first daughter, as some scholars have proposed. The portrait is strikingly large; its size is equal to that of commissions acquired by wealthier art patrons of the time. This extravagance has been explained as a sign of Francesco and Lisa's social aspiration.|$|E
5|$|Shen Zhou died in {{the late}} winter of 1051 (or early 1052), when his son Shen Kuo was 21 years old. Shen Kuo grieved for his father, and {{following}} Confucian ethics, remained inactive {{in a state of}} <b>mourning</b> <b>for</b> three years until 1054 (or early 1055). As of 1054, Shen began serving in minor local governmental posts. However, his natural abilities to plan, organize, and design were proven early in life; one example is his design and supervision of the hydraulic drainage of an embankment system, which converted some one hundred thousand acres (400km²) of swampland into prime farmland. Shen Kuo noted that the success of the silt fertilization method relied upon the effective operation of sluice gates of irrigation canals.|$|E
