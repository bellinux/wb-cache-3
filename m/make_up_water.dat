40|$|Substantial {{potential}} energy savings exist for many parts washing and cleaning processes in use today. Energy usage is frequently {{the largest single}} variable cost involved in parts washing and cleaning operations. Several control parameters such as Dynamic Surface Tension, pH, Conductivity, Temperature, Turbidity and Water Softener Pretreatment can be combined using currently available sensors, data acquisition systems and process control technology to maximize production efficiency while minimizing operating process temperatures, product rejects and related operating costs. Most parts washing systems are operated at elevated temperatures to ensure that used cleaning solutions continue to clean parts {{as long as possible}} between cleaning solution bath dumps. This is based on the theory that higher temperatures will reduce the viscosity or liquefy greases to speed the removal process. This strategy can be counter productive. Operating at elevated temperatures increases water evaporation and results in substantial energy losses. Increased <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>water</b> required to replace water lost to evaporation also results in increased magnesium and calcium salts building up in the cleaning bath. Surfactants that are tied up with calcium and magnesium salts are not available to help clean processed parts. This shortens the cleaning bath life unless soft water or DI water is used for <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>water</b> additions. Excess calcium and magnesium salts precipitate to form calcium and magnesium carbonate and sulfate heater tube scaling and substantially reduces heat transfer efficiency. These costs can all be substantially reduced by lowering cleaning bath operating temperatures. Good process control data collection combined with new online process control system capabilities now allow operators to lower operating bath temperatures and replace high temperature QA/QC (Quality Assurance/ Quality Control) cleaning safety factors with real process control of cleaning bath chemistry.

40|$|This {{document}} {{was created to}} comply with the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (CVRWQCB) Waste Discharge Requirement (Order No. 98 - 148). This order established new requirements to assess the effect of and effort required to reduce salts in process water discharged to the subsurface. This includes the review of technical, operational, and management options available to reduce total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations in cooling tower and mechanical equipment water discharges at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's (LLNL's) Experimental Test Site (Site 300) facility. It was observed that for the six cooling towers currently in operation, the total volume of groundwater used as <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>water</b> is about 27 gallons per minute and the discharge to the subsurface via percolation pits is 13 gallons per minute. The extracted groundwater has a TDS concentration of 700 mg/L. The cooling tower discharge concentrations range from 700 to 1, 400 mg/L. There is also a small volume of mechanical equipment effluent being discharged to percolation pits, with a TDS range from 400 to 3, 300 mg/L. The cooling towers and mechanical equipment are maintained and operated in a satisfactory manner. No major leaks were identified. Currently, there are no re-use options being employed. Several approaches known to reduce the blow down flow rate and/or TDS concentration being discharged to the percolation pits and septic systems were reviewed for technical feasibility and cost efficiency. These options range from efforts as simple as eliminating leaks to implementing advanced and innovative treatment methods. The various options considered, and their anticipated effect on water consumption, discharge volumes, and reduced concentrations are listed and compared in this report. Based on the assessment, it was recommended that there is enough variability in equipment usage, chemistry, flow rate, and discharge configurations that each discharge location at Site 300 should be considered separately when deciding on an approach for reducing the salt discharge to the subsurface. The smaller units may justify moderate changes to equipment, and may benefit from increased cleaning frequencies, more accurate and suitable chemical treatment, and sources of <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>water</b> and discharge re-use. The larger cooling towers would be more suitable for automated systems where they don't already exist, re-circulation and treatment of blow down water, and enhanced chemical dosing strategies. It may be more technically feasible and cost efficient for the smaller cooling towers to be replaced by closed loop dry coolers or hybrid towers. There are several potential steps that could be taken at each location to reduce the TDS concentration and/or water use. These include: sump water filtration, minimization of drift, accurate chemical dosing, and use of scale and corrosion coupons for chemical calibration. The implementation of some of these options could be achieved by a step-wise approach taken at two representative facilities. Once viable prototype systems have been proven in the field, systematic implementation should proceed for the remaining systems, with cost, desired reduction, and general feasibility taken into consideration for such systems...|$|E

During operation, the canal was used for under water transfer of irradiated materials and other metals from the reactor in Building 3001 to the Building 3019 hot cell for further processing. After shutdown of the reactor, the canal was used for storage of irradiated materials and fission products until 1990 when the larger materials were removed and stored in the Department of Energy (DOE) approved solid waste management storage facilities.

In Phase II, it was decided that treatment of source or <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>water</b> was more appropriate, and that higher dosing with coagulants delivered promising results.

Lime-soda water softening and the precipitation of magnesium hydroxide were shown to be too limited in terms of effectiveness, speed, and energy consumption to be considered further for the present application. In Phase IV, sodium aluminate emerged as an effective coagulant for silica, and the most attractive of those tested to date because of its availability, ease of use, and low requirement for additional chemicals.

HVAC systems are also {{the primary source of}} environmental emissions for the majority of companies operating within the biotechnology and drugs sector. While the processes used in drug manufacture have negligible environmental impact, the power plants, and water treatment facilities which annually provide the billions of kilowatt hours (kWh) of required electricity and hundreds of billions of gallons of <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>water</b> [5], also produce tons of CO 2, CO, VOC, PM 10, SO 2, NOX, and in some cases Hg [3].

40|$|Management {{of cooling}} tower {{blowdown}} {{is one of}} the key components in cooling tower operation and usually requires treatment to meet local, state or federal discharge regulations. Typical options for power plants blowdown management include discharge to surface waters or wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and zero liquid discharge (ZLD). Compared to other options, ZLD is preferred as it helps to decrease environmental impact of power generation, especially for power plants using reclaimed water for their recirculating cooling systems. ZLD typically includes one or more of the following advanced treatment technologies: (1) Membrane filtration; (2) Electrodialysis (ED); and (3) Evaporation. The objectives of cooling tower blowdown treatment is to recover water with the quality equal to or better than the makeup water so that it can be returned to the cooling loop. In this study, membrane filtration was evaluated as a possible treatment option for blowdown from cooling towers operated using secondary treated municipal wastewater ("MWW blowdown") and acid mine drainage ("AMD blowdown") as <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>water.</b> Treatability studies with microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes, were carried out for the MWW and AMD blowdown in a bench-scale membrane filtration unit. It was observed that the nanofiltration with BW 30 membrane was effective in reducing the concentration of dissolved species in MWW blowdown: TDS and sulfate decreased from 3, 060 and 326 mg/L to 379 and 31 mg/L, respectively. Sequential filtration by NF 90 and BW 30 membranes was required to reduce the TDS and sulfate in AMD blowdown from 5, 810 and 3, 079 mg/L to 192 and 107 mg/L, respectively. Preliminary studies also indicated that a trans-membrane pressure of 135 psi is sufficient to achieve acceptable permeate flux. Lowering pH of the feed water from 7. 4 to 6. 0 resulted in higher permeate flux, while increasing it to 9. 0 had an adverse impact on permeate flux.

40|$|There {{have been}} a lot of {{investigations}} on acid gas removal using absorption process in which different types of solvents including physical solvents, chemical solvents and hybrid solvents are used. One of these chemical solvents is a kind of tertiary amine called MDEA. The main goal of this master thesis is modeling an acid gas removal plant using MDEA. At first, a brief explanation about Natural gas chain in Norwegian continental shelf is given, then a bibliographical research was made regarding acid gas removal processes; in addition, some criteria for selection of proper acid gases removal process are discussed. Asg&# 229;rd B has an offshore absorption unit to remove selective acid gas using FLEXORB- a solvent which is used to remove selectively H 2 S. Another solvent that can be used in the absorption process to remove H 2 S selectively is MDEA. In this project, MDEA is replaced with FLEXORB to observe the solvent behavior from different angles in the Asg&# 229;rd B acid gas removal unit. For this purpose, a simulation of the process has been done in which MDEA was used as a solvent and the obtained results will be discussed. The simulation of this plant is designed based on the data collected from Statoil. Unisim software has been chosen to simulate amine based acid gas removal unit. It has also been tried to optimize the process. To do so, heat exchanger network was designed using Pinch Analysis method and the required external energy has been calculated. It helps to use heat flows of the streams in the process in order not to waste the energy. Finally, it is concluded that required recycled flow rate of MDEA is much more than FLEXORB and consequently, the required <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>water</b> for MDEA solvent will be more than required water in the process using FLEXORB. Furthermore, FLEXORB acts more selectively than MDEA in the case of H 2 S removal. Changing different parameters in the simulation shows that (i) inlet lean amine temperature entering the absorber does not affect the absorption process, (ii) increasing of heat duty in the reboiler of regenerator decreases acid gases in the treated gas, (iii) lean amine flow rate with an acceptable loading has a direct effect on the product quality.

40|$|In {{preparation}} of gelant solution for making crosslinked polymer gels for water shutoff applications unpublished experiments plus chemical intuition suggest that, unless hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) polymer is fully hydrated before addition of crosslinker, the final gel will have lower than optimum mechanical strength. It is suggested so because polymer chains {{need to be}} unfolded before proper crosslinking can occur. We have evaluated gel strengths of ?flowing? gels for water shut off in natural fractures and other non-matrix features {{as a function of}} time of addition of crosslinker relative to time of hydration of polymer. Gels were prepared from moderately high molecular weight HPAM crosslinked with chromium(III) acetate (CrAc) or polyethyleneimine (PEI). Crosslinker was added after either (1) initial wetting of solid polymer particles or (2) complete hydration of polymer. HPAM can be purchased as a fine particulate hydrocarbon slurry or as a solution concentrate, either of which, when diluted into makeup water, rapidly provides fully hydrated polymer solution. However, dry HPAM is often preferred because of lower overall cost of active material and smaller storage footprint than slurry or liquid concentrates. The down side of using the solid product is that it generally requires two or more large blending tanks in order to fully hydrate polymer for large volume gel treatments. However, if conditions exist where crosslinker can be added to wetted but not fully hydrated polymer, then dry polymer and crosslinker can be blended in a small continuous flow unit, with full hydration occurring downhole prior to gelation. Gel strengths were determined using a common qualitative coding system for gels prepared in identical manner except for timing of crosslinker addition. Crosslinker was added immediately after wetting of polymer or after polymer had been agitated until complete hydration. Samples were prepared in fresh water or 4 % NaCl brine and at ambient temperature or 122 ?F. For almost all samples of polymer gels prepared with identical concentrations of HPAM and CrAc, there was no observable difference in gel strength regardless of time of addition of crosslinker. HPAM/CrAc polymer gels with 4 wt% NaCl <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>water</b> were lower in strength by one code level with respect to those prepared with fresh water. For polymer gels hydrated at 122 ?F with 4 wt% NaCl there was no gel strength code level difference with respect to those prepared at ambient temperature with 4 wt% NaCl. For HPAM/PEI polymer gels the majority of the samples showed similar gel strengths regardless of the timing of crosslinker addition. A few polymer gels showed weaker gel strengths when prepared from partially hydrated polymer solution before crosslinker addition. Presence of 4 wt% NaCl in the makeup water gave weaker gel strengths than those prepared with fresh water with an average difference of four code levels. The pre-gel viscosity of a polymer solution was also compared to the timing of crosslinker addition at ambient temperature. For HPAM/PEI system the overall polymer solution viscosity decreased when PEI was added whereas for HPAM/CrAc system the polymer solution viscosity remained similar after crosslinker was added to the completely hydrated polymer solution but increased when crosslinker was added to partially hydrated polymer solution. The most significant result of this work is the demonstration that for most field applications optimum quality gel can be obtained using dry polymer and a small continuous mixing system for initial wetting of the polymer after which the crosslinker can be added to the polymer solution on the fly. This practice can decrease the footprint, equipment requirements and labor and thus the cost of large volume flowing gel treatments...|$|E

A regional groundwater flow model has been developed by the Queensland Government to predict drawdown impacts due to Coal Seam Gas activities in the Surat basin. This groundwater model is undergoing continued refinement and there is currently scope to address some of the key areas of uncertainty including better quantification of groundwater recharge and unmetered groundwater extractions. Research is currently underway to improve the accuracy of estimates of both of these components of the groundwater balance in order to reduce uncertainty in predicted groundwater drawdowns due to CSG activities...|$|R
