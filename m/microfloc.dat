Recent progress on speciation, stability, and coagulation mechanisms of the hydroxyl aluminum clusters formed by PACl and alum has been critically reviewed. The complicated nature on species formation, stability, and transformation of various hydrolyzed aluminum clusters formed by PACl and Alum are discussed. Based on the aspects of spontaneous hydrolysis, forced hydrolysis, and dual-hydrolysis models, the special stability of aluminum clusters that results in various coagulation behaviors is compared with the traditional salts. The coagulation behavior of the hydroxyl aluminum clusters in terms of particle aggregation and restabilization, surface adsorption and coverage, <b>microfloc</b> formation and kinetics, modified DLVO simulation, and finally, the coagulation model is then analyzed in detail.

40|$|Most entrained estuarine {{sediment}} mass {{occurs as}} flocs. Parameterising flocculation has proven {{difficult as it}} is a dynamically active process dependent on a set of complex interactions between the sediment, fluid and the flow. However the natural variability in an estuary makes it difficult to study the factors that influence the behaviour of flocculation in a systematic manner. This paper presents preliminary results from a laboratory study that examined how floc properties of a natural estuarine mud from the Medway (UK), evolved in response to varying levels of suspended sediment concentration and induced turbulent shearing. The experiments utilised the LabSFLOC floc video camera system, in combination with an annular mini-flume to shear the suspended sediment slurries. The flows created in the mini-flume produced average shear stresses, at the floc sampling height, ranging from 0. 01 N m? 2 to a peak of 1. 03 N m? 2. Nominal suspended particulate matter concentrations of 100, 600 and 2000 mg l? 1 were introduced into the flume. The experimental runs produced individual flocs ranging in size from microflocs of 22. 2 ?m to macroflocs 583. 7 ?m in diameter. Average settling velocities ranged from 0. 01 to 26. 1 mm s? 1, whilst floc effective densities varied from 3. 5 up to 2000 kg m? 3. Low concentration and low shear stress were seen to produce an even distribution of floc mass between the macrofloc (> 160 ?m) and <b>microfloc</b> (< 160 ?m) fractions. As both concentration and stress rose, the proportion of macrofloc mass increased, until they represented over 80 % of the suspended matter. A maximum average macrofloc settling velocity of 3. 3 mm s? 1 was attained at a shear stress of 0. 45 N m? 2. Peak turbulence conditions resulted in deflocculation, limiting the macrofloc fall velocity to only 1. 1 mm s? 1 and placing over 60 % of the mass in the <b>microfloc</b> size range. A statistical analysis of the data suggests that the combined influence of both suspended concentration and turbulent shear controls the settling velocity of the fragile, low density macroflocs...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn the Bach Dang-Cam Estuary, {{northern}} Vietnam, mechanisms governing cohesive sediment aggregation {{were investigated}} in situ in 2008 - 2009. As {{part of the}} Red River delta, this estuary exhibits a marked contrast in hydrological conditions between the monsoon and dry seasons. The impact on flocculation processes was assessed by means of surveys of water discharge, suspended particulate matter concentration and floc size distributions (FSDs) conducted during a tidal cycle at three selected sites along the estuary. A method was developed for calculating the relative volume concentration for the modes of various size classes from FSDs provided by the LISST 100 X (Sequoia Scientific Inc.). It was found that all FSDs comprised four modes identified as particles/flocculi, fine and coarse <b>microflocs,</b> and macroflocs. Under {{the influence of the}} instantaneous turbulent kinetic energy, their proportions varied but without significant modification of their median diameters. In particular, when the turbulence level corresponded to a Kolmogorov microscale of less than ∼ 235 μm, a major breakup of flocs resulted in the formation of particles/flocculi and fine <b>microflocs.</b> Fluctuations in turbulence level were governed by seasonal variations in freshwater discharge and by the tidal cycle. During the wet season, strong freshwater input induced a high turbulent energy level that tended to generate sediment transfer from the coarser size classes (macroflocs, coarse <b>microflocs)</b> to finer ones (particles/flocculi and fine <b>microflocs),</b> and to promote a transport of sediment seawards. During the dry season, the influence of tides predominated. The turbulent energy level was then only episodically sufficiently high to generate transfer of sediment between floc size classes. At low turbulent energy, modifications in the proportions of floc size classes were due to differential settling. Tidal pumping produced a net upstream transport of sediment. Associated with the settling of sediment trapped in a near-bed layer at low turbulent energy, this causes the silting up of the waterways leading to the harbour of Haiphong...|$|R
40|$|Particle Size Distributions (PSDs) of {{suspended}} particulate matters in a coastal zone are log-normal and multimodal in general. The multimodal PSD, {{which is caused}} by the mixing of multiple particle and aggregate size groups under flocculation and erosion/resuspension, is a record of the particle and aggregate dynamics in a coastal zone. Curve-fitting software was used to decompose the multimodal PSD into subordinate log-normal PSDs of primary particles, flocculi, <b>microflocs</b> and macroflocs. The curve-fitting analysis for a time series of multimodal PSDs in the Belgian coastal zone showed the dependency of the multimodality on (1) shear-dependent flocculation in a flood and ebb tide, (2) breakage-resistant flocculation in the spring season and (3) silt-sized particle erosion and advection in a storm surge.

40|$|Ballasted flocculation, {{also known}} as high rate clarification, is a physical-chemical {{treatment}} process that uses continuously recycled media {{and a variety of}} additives to improve the settling properties of suspended solids through improved floc bridging. The objective of this process is to form <b>microfloc</b> particles with a specific gravity of greater than two. Faster floc formation and decreased particle settling time allow clarification to occur up to ten times faster than with conventional clarification, allowing treatment of flows at a significantly higher rate than allowed by traditional unit processes. Ballasted flocculation units function through the addition of a coagulant, such as ferric sulfate; an anionic polymer; and a ballast material such as microsand, a microcarrier, or chemically enhanced sludge. When coupled with chemical addition, this ballast material {{has been shown to be}} effective in reducing coagulation-sedimentation time (Liao, et al., 1999). For instance, ballasted flocculation units have operated with overflow rates of 815 to 3, 260 L/m 2 �min (20 to 80 gal/ft 2 �min) while achieving total suspended solids removal of 80 to 95 percent (Tarallo, et al., 1998). The compact size of ballasted flocculation units makes them particularly attractive for retrofit and high rate applications.

Turbulence has long been recognised as having an impact on flocculation; whether constructive or destructive. This paper presents results from a laboratory study that examined how floe properties of a natural estuarine mud from the Orwell estuary (Suffolk, England), responded to varying levels of suspended sediment concentration and induced turbulent shearing. The site was chosen since dredged material has been used in this area to test the effectiveness of building mudflats as a mechanism for flood defence. All sediment slurries were sheared using a 1. 2 m diameter annular flume, and sampled using the LabSFLOC floe video instrumentation system. The flows created in the flume produced average shear stresses ranging from 0. 1 N m ^ to a peak of 0. 9 N m"^. Nominal suspended particulate matter concentrations of 0. 2, 1 and 5 g F^ were introduced into the flume.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the suspended particle matter behavior and flocculation properties of a shallow mixed-sediment estuarine environment. As a part of the collaborative research project COHBED, this study presents unique results of the temporal and spatial variations of suspended sediment loads in an environment compromising both biologically active cohesive and non-cohesive sediments. The field study was conducted during spring tide in May 2013. Two fields sites representing a mixed-sediment environment with predominance of non-cohesive sediment (Site A) and cohesive sediments (Site B) were selected, and investigations were performed over two tidal cycles. Temporally Sites A and B showed an increase in suspended particle matter concentration (SPMC) (50 - 600 mg/l) with maxima one hour prior and subsequent to high water (HW) and minima at HW. The turbulent shear stress (TSS) (0 - 0. 25 N/m 2) and SPMC are found as the main drivers for floc formation. Site A exhibits a floc size range of 40 - 500 μm. A predominance of <b>microflocs</b> ( 160 μm) dominate the sediment suspension. Site B exhibits a floc size range of 40 - 700 μm. The great floc size range show a bi-modality of both high density macroflocs and low density (16 kg/m 3) <b>microflocs</b> throughout the tidal cycle. The spatial difference in floc size (D), settling velocity (ws) and effective density (⇢eff) is caused by the sand:mud ratio. Site A shows a predominance of dense possibly non-cohesive <b>microflocs,</b> while Site B shows a predominance of cohesive macroflocs. A greater abundance of macroflocs will thus be found at more cohesive sites in a mixed-sediment environment. Ultimately, the formation of flocs depends on the prevalent TSS and SPMC as well as the sand:mud ratio. The mean values of D, ws and ⇢eff during flood or ebb are not representative for the individual floc populations, as the variables show continuously changing developments. These results have implications for the numerical modeling and prediction of sediment transport within mixed-sediment environments...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAn {{approach}} combining {{laboratory experiments}} and numerical modelling {{was used to}} investigate the behaviour of a ﬂoc population during an idealized tidal cycle. The experiment was conducted on suspended sediments at a concentration of 93 mg l 1 collected in the ﬁeld. It {{was based on a}} jar test device to reproduce tidal-induced turbulence and coupled with a CCD camera system and image post- processing software to monitor ﬂoc size distribution. At the same time, a 0 D size-class based aggregation/fragmentation model (FLOCMOD) was developed to simulate changes in the ﬂoc population over the tidal cycle. Experimental results revealed strong variability of the behaviour of <b>microﬂoc</b> and macroﬂoc populations with respect to the varying shear rates observed in situ. In particular, the major dependency of ﬂoc sizes on the Kolmogorov microscale was conﬁrmed. Time-scale differences were also observed for aggregation and fragmentation processes which led to asymmetrical ﬂoc behaviour despite symmetrical tidal forcing. Model results, i. e. average diameter, maximum diameter and ﬂoc size distribution, were in good agreement with experimental data with an RMS error between observed and computed average diameters of below 25 mm over the tidal cycle. FLOCMOD was optimized in terms of the time step, number of size classes and size range: only seven classes ranging from 50 to 643 mm associated with a dynamically-adaptable time step were needed to correctly reproduce experimental results, characterized by an RMS error of less than 5 mm with respect to the reference case (100 classes from 4 to 1500 mm). Sensitivity analyses were performed on major parameters or processes: initial ﬂoc size distribution, primary particle size, fractal dimension and fragmentation function (binary, ternary, erosion or collision-induced fragmentation). Results showed that initial ﬂoc size distribution played a role only during the ﬁrst aggregation stage. Low variability of the fractal dimension did not signiﬁcantly modify model results, while larger differences were observed when the primary particle size was changed, especially towards the largest sizes (10 mm). Nevertheless, these two structural parameters had a strong impact on the calculated mean settling velocity with differences of 0. 2 mm scompared with the reference case. Different fragmentation functions were shown to signiﬁcantly modify model results, except for collision-induced shear stress. In particular, combining ﬂoc erosion with binary breakup in the shear fragmentation term enabled us to reproduce bimodal distributions, patterns that are typically observed in situ...|$|E

The Skagerrak, which receives suspended matter from the southern {{as well as from}} the central and northern North Sea, took up an intermediate position. In summer suspended matter concentrations were lower than in winter but more variable, in concentration as well as in organic content, because of admixtures of particulate matter from primary production. On deposition of the suspended matter, a considerable part of the organic matter was apparently lost (in the order of 75 % or more), resulting in low organic-matter concentrations of fine-grained bottom deposits. Particle size distributions followed two main types: one (A) with a sharp peak at 30 to 100 µm, and one (B) bell-shaped with a peak at 5 to 15 µm. Type A occurred in deeper water and consisted of particles with a high organic-matter content, type B occurred in shallow areas and consisted of particles with a low organic-matter content. The suspended particles were mainly <b>microflocs</b> of mineral particles and organic matter. The mineral particles of both types were predominantly of 2 to 5 µm size, which was determined after oxidation of the organic matter. It is concluded that particles of type-B distributions are regularly exchanged with the bottom through deposition and resuspension, which results in low organic-matter contents and prevents the <b>microflocs</b> reaching large sizes.

Curve-fitting software in this research decomposed such multimodal PSDs into subordinate log-normal PSDs. The four modal peaks, consisting of four-level ordered structures of primary particles, flocculi, <b>microflocs</b> and macroflocs, were identified and found to alternately rise and sink in a flow-varying tidal cycle due to shear-dependent flocculation. The four modal PSDs could further be simplified to two discrete size groups of flocculi and flocs.

Les procédés traditionnels les éliminent mal : ils sont peu iodégradables et la seule floculation, {{par exemple}} par des sels de fer, donne des résultats insuffisants. Or, en Algérie, la réutilisation agricole des eaux usées même industrielles est devenue une impérieuse nécessité. Le procédé proposé repose sur l'utilisation de sels d'aluminium ou, mieux encore, un polyhydroxyaluminium, associés à une bentonite de forage très fine présentant l'avantage d'être localement disponible et peu coûteuse. Quatre colorants ont été testés. Ils appartiennent à deux grandes familles : les colorants acides d'une part, Jaune Supranol 4 GL et Vert Nylomine C 8 B et les colorants dispersifs d'autre part, Rouge Foron RDGL et Violet Foron S 3 RL. Les essais montrent que, si la bentonite seule ou les sels d'aluminium seuls présentent des efficacités insuffisantes, ces derniers du fait d'une mauvaise décantabilité des <b>microflocs</b> formés, l'association bentonite-aluminium permet d'éliminer les colorants en quasi totalité avec une excellente décantabilité. Les concentrations optimales à mettre en oeuvre sont relativement basses, de l'ordre de 13 mg/l de Al 3 + et 250 mg/l de bentonite. Les coûts d'exploitation sont donc très raisonnables. Sur un effluent industriel réel, le procédé permet de passer d'une DCO de 770 mg/l à moins de 30 mg/l. The textile industry uses synthetic dyes, {{most of them}} being toxic. In Algeria, the agricultural reuse of treated wastewater, even of industrial origin, is becoming commonplace. It is therefore compulsory to drastically reduce pollutant fluxes. The presently operated conventional processes cannot meet the water quality requirements: bioelimination of dyes is negligible and flocculation with iron salts, as currently {{carried out in the}} SOITEX plant located in Tlemcen, Algeria, is not effective enough. The use of aluminum salts in the flocculation of such wastewaters is well known (FIESSINGER AND BERSILLON, 1977; LAHAV et al., 1978) but the resulting <b>microflocs</b> are not easily settleable. Bentonite, locally available at a low cost, can also eliminate micropollutants (LAHAV et al., 1978). Associated with polyhydroxyaluminum, it can reduce such compounds as benzene or toluene, favoring simultaneously the liquid-solids separation. This paper evaluates the treatability of dyes by bentonite associated with aluminum salts. All the runs were carried out in a 200 cm 3 batch reactor, mechanically stirred and thermoregulated at 20 ·C. The main physico-chemical characteristics of the bentonite are given in Table 1. The flocculant was aluminum chloride, previously neutralized with sodium hydroxide (mass ratio OH-/Al= 1. 85). The solutions were used immediately or left to polymerize during 6 days leading to polyhydroxyaluminum PHAl (LAHAV et al., 1978). When the reactor was operated with bentonite and aluminum, the mass ratio Al/bentonite was maintained at 53. 10 - 3 (KACHA, 1994). Four dyes belonging to two main families were tested: Supranol Yellow 4 GL and Nylomine Green (acid dyes) and Foron Red RDGL and Foron Violet S 3 RL (dispersive dyes). Their concentrations were obtained by spectrophotometry. Bentonite alone does not induce a significant abatement excepted for low pH values around 4 (Figs. 1 and 2). Dye elimination appears to require a previous protonation step followed by cation exchange. The equilibrium can be modeled by a Freundlich equation (Fig. 3 and Table 2). The dyes can also be eliminated by aluminum salts alone (Fig. 4). The efficiency is then better with polyhydroxyaluminum, i. e. more than 90 % of the initial concentration is removed. Nevertheless, the dyes abatement probably results from an adsorption or chemical reaction on <b>microflocs</b> which are not easily settleable. By assuming that all the aluminum ions are precipitated as aluminum hydroxide, the equilibrium is modeled by the Langmuir equation which would indicate a monolayer adsorption (Fig. 5). When the reactor is operated with bentonite and aluminum salts, dye abatement is nearly complete and the liquid-solids separation is particularly efficient (Figs. 6 and 7). The best results are obtained with PHAl but the use of the monomer can be sufficient. The required concentrations are relatively low and the process is then economically feasible (Table 3). However, the experimental data can no longer be modeled by the Freundlich equation nor by the Langmuir equation. When the aluminum salts react alone with the dyes, the conductance displayed against the aluminum concentration shows two straight lines of different slopes (Fig. 8). The abscissa of the points where the slopes change are proportional to the initial dye concentration, suggesting a chemical reaction between the dye and the aluminum salts (Fig. 9). However, the final pH value lies at the limit value of aluminum hydroxide precipitation; an adsorption on aluminum hydroxide or an aluminum salt precipitation cannot then be assumed. In presence of bentonite, such changes of slope are not observed and, moreover, the final pH value does not correspond either to a precipitation value (Figs. 11 and 12). At this stage, a comprehensive mechanism cannot thus be proposed. However, the process using bentonite/PHAl is particularly efficient and easy to operate (Fig. 13 and Table 3). The results were confirmed with a true industrial effluent, the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of which was reduced from 770 mg/l to less than 30 mg/l (Fig. 14). As a matter of comparison, the actual process, which includes an activated sludge treatment followed by an iron sulfate/lime flocculation, leads to an effluent containing only 140 mgCOD/l...|$|R
40|$|The {{suspended}} particulate matter (SPM) concentration in the high turbidity zones of the southern North Sea is inversely correlated with chlorophyll (Chl) concentration. During winter, SPM concentration is high and Chl concentration is low and vice versa during summer. This seasonality has often {{been associated with the}} seasonal pattern in wind forcing. However, the decrease in SPM concentration corresponds well with the spring algal bloom. Does the decrease of SPM concentration caused by changing wind conditions cause the start of algae bloom, or does the algae bloom decrease SPM concentrations through enhanced flocculation and deposition? To answer the question, measurements from 2011 of particle size distribution (PSD), SPM, and Chl concentrations from the southern North Sea have been analyzed. The results indicate that the frequency of occurrence of macroflocs has a seasonal signal, while seasonality has little impact upon floc size. The data from a highly turbid coastal zone suggest that the maximum size of the macroflocs is controlled by turbulence and the available flocculation time during a tidal cycle, but the strength of the macroflocs is controlled by the availability of sticky organic substances associated with enhanced primary production during spring and summer. The results highlight the shift from mainly <b>microflocs</b> and flocculi in winter toward more muddy marine snow with larger amounts of macroflocs in spring and summer. The macroflocs will reduce the SPM concentrations in the turbidity maximum area as they settle faster. Consequently, the SPM concentration decreases and the light condition increases in the surface layer enhancing algae growth further. Key Points SPM and Chl concentration have opposing seasonal signal The seasonality of SPM concentration is mainly caused by biological effects Macroflocs are more abundant and stronger in summer than winter seaso...|$|R
40|$|The {{settling}} velocity of {{suspended particulate matter}} (SPM) is a key parameter controlling deposition processes and its accurate determination has been regarded as a top priority in improving numerical models of cohesive sediment transport. Because SPM occurs predominantly as aggregates of organic and inorganic particles in cohesive coastal systems, an in situ quantification of {{settling velocity}} is essential. The available techniques to measure the settling velocity of aggregates in the field include: Owen tubes and similar, settling columns equipped with optical sensors, laser systems or video cameras as well as acoustics and holographic systems. None of these techniques is able to directly measure the massconcentration of SPM or its settling velocity mass distribution in situ. In this work, a new instrument (SEDVEL – Sedimentation Velocity) was developed to directly and automatically measure SPM mass of cohesive sediments in situ, from which the mass/concentration distribution of settling velocities can be determined. This instrument consists of an underwater balance (resolution of 0. 01 g) placed inside a settling tube, which directly measures the variation in time of the immersed weight of particulate matter (PM) as it settles on a plate located at the tube bottom under quiescent conditions. SEDVEL operates underwater and automatically withdraws water samples ― deployment periods of a few days. The design of SEDVEL and its components are described {{as well as the}} procedure adopted in its calibration and data analysis. Results of the assessment of the instrument performance in the laboratory and in the field are analysed. SEDVEL presented consistent and reproducible results when tested in the laboratory. It was able to reproduce the initial particles concentrations ranging from 7 to 200 mg l- 1 (r 2 = 0. 9, p < 0. 01) in 13 laboratory experiments. Results also suggested that some particle reflocculation induced by the settling column can take place for concentrations higher than 50 mg l- 1. Field trials, carried out in Cleveland Bay at Berth 11 (Townsville Harbour, Australia) and at the Pier (Strand Beach, Townsville, Australia), showed that SEDVEL reproduced the general tendency of the measured SPM concentrations in 42 cycles of measurement (r 2 = 0. 65, p < 0. 01). At the Pier, settling velocities presented a main mode of relatively slow-settling particles/flocs within 0. 09 ≤ Ws < 0. 5 mm s- 1, and usually a second mode of 1. 5 ≤ Ws < 3. 0 mm s- 1. The settling dynamics at this location were mainly determined by erosion and deposition of sediment particles from and to the bottom close to the headland as well as by advection of offshore floc populations during the rising tide. At Berth 11, aggregates were composed mainly of <b>microflocs</b> of low-density and slow settling velocities (0. 09 ≤ Ws < 0. 12 mm s- 1). The estimated mean density of flocs, 40...|$|R
40|$|Water environments {{accommodate}} {{a variety of}} societal functions, like navigation, dredging, oceanography, hydrographic data acquisition and visualization techniques, coastal zone management, meteorology, wind farms (renewable energy development), provision of ecological and biological variability in the ecosystems and fishing, provision of potable water supply and serve the industrial and wastewater processes demand. To ensure a healthy environment, a complex balance is essentially required {{in the understanding of}} the rate of movement of cohesive and non-cohesive sediment particles that are contained in the fluid flowing in man’s ecosystem hence the study of flocculation of suspended sediments and the influence of EPS (polymers) on them. The specific focus of this dissertation is directed towards the generation of flocs by sediment flocculation and the behavioural investigation of a population of flocs with EPS in a typical aqueous environment under varying conditions The experiments were intended to study floc size distribution; floc structure, flocculation models and settling velocity investigating as a stand-alone data set sufficient to yield and address knowledge gaps through three methods: experiments, mathematical analysis and numerical modelling. The experimental runs carried out using the annular flume and the LabFlocs system in the Brunel laboratory of the University of Plymouth (UoP) under different shear stress (turbulence intensity) and concentration conditions has summarily given insights into flocs population in different conditions. The innovative Labflocs system has provided an opportunity to study the properties of suspension of cohesive and non-cohesive sediments allowing analysis and results to be obtained for further studies and decision making for individual flocs. Images collected and observed has given better understanding of floc size distribution and individual structure interacting with EPS. An SPM concentration of 200 mg/l, varying shear stress were used to study different sediment combinations to compute their effective densities, peculiar characteristics to model flocculation of the respective sediment particles. Knowledge of MSF, aggregation theory, settling velocities, effective densities, macroflocs (160 µm) have been investigated and proven that <b>microflocs</b> are the foundation beams of the flocculation phenomenon. Sand, Clay and EPS have exhibited their peculiar characteristics to aid these studies with time, in response to different shear stress and concentrations. The accuracy of effective density values is very essential to knowing if sediment particle would flocculate or not [...] The analysis of floc structure and the distribution of floc sizes from the runs proves that this method of non-invasive modelling of flocculation of sediments (cohesive and non-cohesive) gives a clearer view of flocs dynamics*. With varying the shear stress and flume concentration, mechanisms of aggregation and breakup have been examined. From the analysis of the result, {{it is clear that the}} implementation of floc structure with and without EPS has varying consequences and the attendant kinematic processes at population scales and size band enables a proper predictive capability of the model. The geometrical structure of the flocs and the interaction among the primary sediment particles within the population are characterized as a source of several considerations in the dynamics of sediments without the experimental data from the settling column, its length and time with respect to the control parameters and the measuring techniques involved...|$|R
