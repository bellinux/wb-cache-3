Before then, abnormal pre-announcement trading volume in the A <b>share</b> <b>market</b> (restricted to locals) suggests inside information, while announcement period return and volume responses suggest “disagreement” in B and H share trading (restricted to foreigners).

40|$|We {{conduct an}} {{empirical}} {{analysis on the}} impact of the United States (US) antidumping actions against the People’s Republic of China (PRC) on the bilateral trade and US imports from other trade partners. Using the data set based on the Harmonized System (HS) tariff code, we examine the trade patterns of the PRC and other countries, and find evidence for the trade restriction effect and the trade diversion effect. Further, we examine the intensity and duration of both restriction and diversion effects. The antidumping measures have effectively raised the prices of imports from the PRC and reduced US imports from the PRC only in the short term. Nevertheless, due to the coexistence of trade diversion effects, the overall remedy effect of antidumping actions on domestic industries is considerably limited. In addition, we investigate other factors that influence the efficiency of antidumping measures, such as the antidumping duty amount, the PRC’s market position in the US, and the US <b>market</b> <b>share</b> in the <b>PRC...</b>|$|R

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsBryan W. SchurleThe {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} simulation model to determine the probability of achieving a <b>market</b> <b>share</b> goal. Two different simulation models were developed and compared allowing the author to select the best model. The first simulation model developed used the current <b>market</b> <b>share</b> as the mean and the standard deviation of historical <b>market</b> <b>share</b> as the standard deviation. So, a <b>market</b> <b>share</b> of 31. 00 % and a standard deviation of 3. 88 % were used in the simulation. When these values were simulated the results determined the probability of achieving the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> goal of 33 %. The simulation results indicated that only 12 out of 100 observations resulted in <b>market</b> <b>share</b> greater than the goal. Therefore, there is a 12 % probability of achieving or exceeding the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> goal based on the current <b>market</b> <b>share</b> and historical <b>market</b> <b>share</b> standard deviation. To predict future <b>market</b> <b>share,</b> a regression model was used to determine the impact of factors on <b>market</b> <b>share.</b> The regression model was used to forecast an estimate of <b>market</b> <b>share.</b> This forecasted share of 31. 13 % was used as the mean and 3. 45 %, the standard error of the model, was used to generate a second simulation model. The simulation results indicated that 26 of 100 observations resulted in <b>market</b> <b>share</b> greater than the goal of 33 %. This indicates that there is a 26 % probability of achieving or exceeding the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> goal based on results using regression to predict future <b>market</b> <b>share</b> and variability in <b>market</b> <b>share.</b> The second simulation model generated from the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> forecast and standard error from the regression model produced the better results.

The effects of changes in R&D and S&M expenditures to future <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> are investigated by using comparable and descriptive methods and regression analysis. The changes in R&D and S&M expenses are reflected against changes in companies’ mobile phone and smartphone <b>market</b> <b>shares.</b> DATA Data set consists of four mobile phone companies and their financial statements from 2003 to 2011. In the regression analysis {{the total number of}} observations in the sample is 24 for mobile phone <b>market</b> <b>share</b> and 22 for smartphone <b>market</b> <b>share.</b> <b>Market</b> <b>shares</b> used in this study for the mobile phone companies are gathered by utilizing Nielsen and Canalys databases. RESULTS Findings of the study show that changes in R&D and S&M expenditures have significant correlation with changes in future smartphone <b>market</b> <b>shares.</b> As the individual companies were studied, correlation was identified with the changes in R&D and S&M expenses and changes in <b>market</b> <b>shares.</b> Furthermore, reviews of financial statements conclude that firms recognize the importance of these activities when evaluating future performance.
