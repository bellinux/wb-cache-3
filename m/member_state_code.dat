40|$|The article {{describes}} the distinctive features and main disadvantages of the Commonwealth of Independent <b>States</b> Model Civil <b>Code’s</b> provisions of general parts of private international law, which found reception in the national legislation of the <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> The <b>Code</b> was accepted {{as a model for}} codification by the majority of the CIS states. An analysis of the Code’s provisions can help interpret the unclear national rules, will allow to predict courts’ modus operandi in conflict-of-laws cases and can provide an opportunity to estimate further development prospects of private international law in the post-Soviet area...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a lively}} debate among {{scholars}} in Europe about how, if at all, the private laws (tort, contract, property) of the European nation {{states should be}} harmonised. Views range from no harmonisation at all, soft law methods such as models contained in Principles, step by step case law developments, to a fully fledged binding European Civil Code. Another hotly debated issue is the disharmonisation (fragmentation) of domestic systems of private law {{as a result of}} current and ongoing EC level harmonisation. The prime consequence of this partial legislative intervention is an enhanced role for the judiciaries of those jurisdictions: they are inevitably entrusted with the fine-tuning of the interaction between domestic and EC private law. Alien concepts make their entry into a <b>Member</b> <b>State’s</b> Civil <b>Code</b> or common law doctrine that do not necessarily easily fit (one scholar has called these “legal irritants”). Most likely, for the foreseeable future, piecemeal harmonisation of specific, and more or less narrow, legal fields is the only show in town...|$|R
