25|$|In clock tree {{optimization}} (CTO) clock can be shielded so {{that noise}} is not coupled to other signals. But shielding increases area by 12 to 15%. Since the clock signal is global in nature the same <b>metal</b> <b>layer</b> used for power routing {{is used for}} clock also. CTO is achieved by buffer sizing, gate sizing, buffer relocation, level adjustment and HFN synthesis. We try to improve setup slack in pre-placement, in placement and post placement optimization before CTS stages while neglecting hold slack. In post placement optimization after CTS hold slack is improved. As a result of CTS lot of buffers are added. Generally for 100k gates around 650 buffers are added.|$|E
25|$|Several {{reactions}} {{occur between}} {{the concrete and}} the corium melt. Free and chemically bound water is released from the concrete as steam. Calcium carbonate is decomposed, producing carbon dioxide and calcium oxide. Water and carbon dioxide penetrate the corium mass, exothermically oxidizing the non-oxidized metals present in the corium and producing gaseous hydrogen and carbon monoxide; large amounts of hydrogen can be produced. The calcium oxide, silica, and silicates melt and are mixed into the corium. The oxide phase, in which the nonvolatile fission products are concentrated, can stabilize at temperatures of 1300–1500°C for a considerable period of time. An eventually present layer of more dense molten metal, containing fewer radioisotopes (Ru, Tc, Pd, etc., initially composed of molten zircaloy, iron, chromium, nickel, manganese, silver, and other construction materials and metallic fission products and tellurium bound as zirconium telluride) than the oxide layer (which concentrates Sr, Ba, La, Sb, Sn, Nb, Mo, etc. and is initially composed primarily of zirconium dioxide and uranium dioxide, possibly with iron oxide and boron oxides), can form an interface between the oxides and the concrete farther below, slowing down the corium penetration and solidifying within a few hours. The oxide layer produces heat primarily by decay heat, while the principal heat source in the <b>metal</b> <b>layer</b> is exothermic reaction with the water released from the concrete.

50|$|Micro-blinds—currently under {{development}} at the National Research Council (Canada)—control the amount of light passing through in response to applied voltage. Micro-blinds are composed of rolled thin metal blinds on glass. They are very small and thus practically invisible to the eye. The <b>metal</b> <b>layer</b> is deposited by magnetron sputtering and patterned by laser or lithography process. The glass substrate includes {{a thin layer of}} a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer. A thin insulator is deposited between the rolled <b>metal</b> <b>layer</b> and the TCO layer for electrical disconnection. With no applied voltage, the micro-blinds are rolled and let light pass through. When there is a potential difference between the rolled <b>metal</b> <b>layer</b> and the transparent conductive layer, the electric field formed between the two electrodes causes the rolled micro-blinds to stretch out and thus block light. The micro-blinds have several advantages, including switching speed (milliseconds), UV durability, customized appearance and transmission. Theoretically, the blinds are simple and cost-effective to fabricate.A video available on YouTube describes briefly the micro-blinds.|$|E

The availability {{of a growing number}} of <b>metal</b> <b>layers</b> presents the opportunity to use wiring in the thirddimension to reduce switch requirements. Unfortunately, traditional FPGA wiring schemes are not designed to exploit these additional <b>metal</b> <b>layers.</b> We introduce an alternate topology, based on Leighton’s Mesh-of-Trees, which carefully exploits hierarchy to allow additional <b>metal</b> <b>layers</b> to support arbitrary device scaling. When wiring layers grow sufficiently fast with aggregate network size (N), our network requires only O(N) area; this is in stark contrast to traditional, Manhattan FPGA routing schemes where switching requirements alone grow superlinearly in N. In practice, we show that, even for the admittedly small designs in the Toronto “FPGA Place and Route Challenge, ” the Mesh-of-Trees networks require 10 % less switches than the standard, Manhattan FPGA routing scheme...|$|R
