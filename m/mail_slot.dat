25|$|A letter box, letterbox, letter plate, letter hole, <b>mail</b> <b>slot</b> or mailbox is a {{receptacle}} {{for receiving}} incoming mail {{at a private}} residence or business. For the opposite purpose of collecting outgoing mail, a post box is generally used instead.|$|E
25|$|The line carries U.S. {{mail and}} was one of the first {{recreational}} railroads to have its own postmark, and is the last railroad in the United States to have continually offered hand-cancelling and processing of mail. The postal cancellation stamp was issued to the railroad by the U.S. Postal Service in 1961. The locomotive of the Zooliner has a postal <b>mail</b> <b>slot</b> on the side of the cab, and mail boxes are located at the Zoo and Washington Park stations.|$|E
25|$|For those neighbourhoods where mail {{delivery}} to a <b>mail</b> <b>slot</b> is still provided, mail slots {{must have an}} opening not less than 17.5cm by 4cm, and must be located in a front door or adjacent panel not more than 125cm and not less than 60cm from the finished floor line. Wall-mounted mailboxes equipped with a slot must have a slot opening measurement not less than 13.5cm by 4cm and the slot located {{on or near the}} top of the box.|$|E

50|$|Intercoms, peep holes, and <b>mail</b> <b>slots</b> can all serve {{purposes}} {{similar to}} the door chain when dealing with strangers, and function without opening the door. Of course, these devices do not provide additional protection to the door itself.|$|R
25|$|Before the {{introduction}} of rural free delivery (RFD) by the Post Office in 1896, and in Canada in 1908, many rural residents had no access to the mail unless they collected it at a post office located many miles from their homes or hired a private express company to deliver it. For this reason, mailboxes did not become popular in rural North America until curbside RFD mail delivery by the Post Office was an established service. Even then, farmers and rural homeowners at first resisted the purchase of dedicated mailboxes, preferring to leave empty bushel baskets, tin boxes, or wooden crates at the roadside for the postman to deposit their mail. Not until 1923 did the Post Office finally mandate that every household install a mailbox or <b>mail</b> <b>slot</b> {{in order to receive}} home delivery of mail.|$|E
2500|$|The US Post Office has {{established}} guidelines for mail recipients, including <b>mail</b> <b>slot</b> or mailbox size, location, and identification requirements. While the Post Office permitted alternative designs for attached mailboxes and mail slots that met basic size and construction requirements, {{the same was}} not true for curbside mailboxes, which postal regulations required be {{in the form of}} the traditional dome-rectangular or 'tunnel-top' design first established in 1915. [...] In 1978, seven years after the establishment of the restructured US Postal Service, postal authorities at last approved a [...] "contemporary" [...] mailbox specification for alternative designs.|$|E
2500|$|Most RPO {{cars had}} a <b>mail</b> <b>slot</b> {{on the side}} of the car, so that mail could {{actually}} be deposited in the car, much like using the corner mail box, while the train was stopped at a station. [...] Those desiring the fastest delivery would bring their letters to the train station for dispatch on the RPO, knowing that overnight delivery would be virtually assured. [...] The mail handled in this manner received a cancellation just as if it had been mailed at a local post office, with the cancel giving the train number, endpoint cities of the RPO route, the date, and RMS Railway Mail Service or PTS Postal Transportation Service between the killer bars. [...] Collecting such cancellations is a pastime of many philatelists and postal history researchers.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} the 1880s, the Post Office had begun to {{encourage}} homeowners to attach wall-mounted mailboxes {{to the outside of}} their houses in lieu of <b>mail</b> <b>slots.</b> Mounted at the height of a standing man, attached mailboxes did not require the mail carrier to lean over to deposit the mail. They also allowed the homeowner to keep outgoing mail dry while awaiting pickup by the mail carrier.|$|R
50|$|In 1914, a 200 sq ft {{addition}} {{was built}} onto the Masonic hall. That {{portion of the}} building served as Rockford’s last U.S. Post Office between 1914 and 1975 and still has original counter window bars and <b>mail</b> <b>slots.</b> The Masonic building, along with two adjacent properties, were purchased by Evelyn Holyfield and her brother, Robert Hardin Holyfield, in 1970. Following their deaths, the Holyfield family on December 31, 2001 donated all three properties to the Rockford Preservation Society.|$|R
50|$|The {{architect}} {{can work}} with the acoustical scientist {{to arrive at the}} best cost-effective means of creating a quiet interior (normally 45 dB). The most important elements of design of the building skin are usually: glazing (glass thickness, double pane design, etc.), roof material, caulking standards, chimney baffles, exterior door design, <b>mail</b> <b>slots,</b> attic ventilation ports and mounting of through the wall air conditioners. A special case of building skin design arises in the case of aircraft noise, where the FAA has funded extensive work in residential retrofit.|$|R
2500|$|Currently, US {{curbside}} mailboxes {{are classified}} as (T) Traditional, (C) Contemporary, or (L) Locking. Traditional or Contemporary non-locking curbside mailboxes are approved in three sizes - No. 1, No. 2, or No. 3, measured by minimum interior dimensions. The largest acceptable curbside mailbox is the No. 3, which measures 22.81inches long, 11inches wide, and 15inches in height (58cm x 28cm x 38cm) at the peak. Locking mailbox designs that provide security for the recipient's incoming mail have fewer restrictions on shape and size, though designs with a slot for incoming mail {{must be at least}} 1.75inches high by 10inches wide. Residential locking mailboxes cannot require the postal carrier to have a key, by USPS Specifications. [...] Therefore, no USPS approved residential locking mailbox has secure outgoing mail. Installation requirements vary from standard unlocked mailboxes: with locking mailboxes, the incoming <b>mail</b> <b>slot</b> must be 41"-45" [...] above the roadside surface, and the front of the mailbox must be 6"-8" [...] back from the curb. [...] USPS specifications for all mailboxes mandate the same, except the placement of the 'incoming mail area' varies with a locking mailbox.|$|E

50|$|An {{analogy to}} public key {{encryption}} {{is that of a}} locked mail box with a <b>mail</b> <b>slot.</b> The <b>mail</b> <b>slot</b> is exposed and accessible to the public - its location (the street address) is, in essence, the public key. Anyone knowing the street address can go to the door and drop a written message through the slot. However, only the person who possesses the key can open the mailbox and read the message.|$|E
25|$|Until 1916, mail {{carriers}} {{knocked on}} the door and waited patiently for someone to answer. Efficiency experts estimated that each mailman lost over 1.5 hours each day just waiting for patrons to come to the door. To correct this problem, the Post Office Department ordered that every household must have a mail box or letter slot in order to receive mail. This requirement was phased in, starting with new delivery locations, around 1912. Slowly, homeowners and businesses began to install <b>mail</b> <b>slots</b> or attached mailboxes to receive mail when they were either not at home or unable to answer the door. The requirement was made mandatory in 1923.|$|R
2500|$|Since 1923, {{in order}} to promote uniformity, as well as the {{convenient}} and rapid delivery of the mail, the United States Post Office Department (later the USPS) has continued to retain authority to approve the size and other characteristics of all mail receptacles, whether mailboxes or <b>mail</b> <b>slots,</b> for use in delivery of the mails. The USPS continues to issue specifications for curbside mailbox construction for use by manufacturers. Approved mailboxes from the latter are always stamped [...] "U.S. Mail" [...] and [...] "Approved by the Postmaster General". These standards have resulted in limitations on product diversity and design, though new materials, shapes, and features have appeared in recent years.|$|R
