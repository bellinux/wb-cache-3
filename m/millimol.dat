40|$|It was {{the purpose}} of the present investigation, to see whether the {{statements}} made by Starkenstein (1) concerning the action of “veramon” 2 in rabbits as compared with those of veronal on one side and of pyramidon on the other are correct, how far pyramidon is antagonized by veronal, whether “veramon ” in large doses is deprived of the stimulant actions of pyramidon, and whether on the contrary the hypnotic action of veronal is antagonized by pyramidon. Therefore experiments on 36 rabbits have been performed, arranged in 12 sets of 3 animals each, one of which was given a certain dose of “veramon, ” the second the amount of veronal present in it, and the third the amount of pyramidon present in it. All applications were made per os.

30|$|In {{a typical}} {{synthesis}} of Bi–Bi 2 O 2 CO 3, 0.2 <b>millimol</b> Bi(NO 3) 3 · 5 H 2 O was first dissolved in 20  mL 1  M HNO 3 (denoted as solution A). Meanwhile, 1.6 <b>millimol</b> Na 2 CO 3 and 50  mg CTAB were dissolved in 20  mL ethanol–water mixture (denoted as solution B). Then, solution B was added into solution A under stirring for 30  min at 30  °C. The resulting mixture was transferred into a 20  mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and was placed into an oven to react at 180  °C for 6  h. The system was then cooled to ambient temperature naturally. The final product was collected and washed with distilled water and absolute alcohol {{at least five}} times. As-prepared samples were dried at 60  °C for 6  h. The reductive nature of EtOH and CTAB allowed an in situ formation of Bi nanoparticles on the Bi 2 O 2 CO 3 nanosheet. As a result, a heterojunction structure consisting of Bi 2 O 2 CO 3 sheets and metallic Bi nanoparticles has been produced. For the synthesis of Bi 2 O 2 CO 3 nanosheets we follow a preparation as reported by Zhou et al. [27].|$|E

The sheaths {{were obtained by}} slitting the nerve fiber, the extracellular electrolytes were washed out in isotonic sucrose solution, and the concentrations in the cells were determined after different soaking times in the sucrose solution. Values for the Schwann cell were calculated by extrapolation to zero time from the plots of the logarithms of the concentrations in the cells {{as a function of}} soaking time in sucrose solution. The Schwann cells made up 84 per cent of the sheath's total cellular volume. The Schwann cell concentrations in <b>millimols</b> per liter, are: 312 (404 - 241) for sodium, 220 (308 - 157) for potassium, and 167 (208 - 138) for chloride.

40|$|The use {{of sodium}} {{bisulfite}} in solutions {{which may be}} given intravenously in relatively large quantities, e. g. protein hydrolysates, requires a knowledge of its systemic toxicity. To date, very little has been published on the intravenous toxicity of sodium bisulfite. Reiss and Gerstl (1946) reported a minimum lethal dose of 1. 02 <b>millimols</b> (106 mgm.) of sodium bisulfite per kgm. by intravenous administration to rabbits. These investigators described {{a reference to the}} toxicity of sodium bisulfite as follows: “ 3 - 4 ml. of a M-aqueous solution of sodium bisuiphite (3 - 400 mgm.) given intravenously were lethal for rabbits. ” As nearly as could be determined, this referred to a review of the pharmacology and toxicology of sulfurous acid (Rost, 1927) which reported that 3 to 4 ml. /kgm. of a one per cent solution of sodium bisulfite injected intravenously in rabbits produced death within six to eight minutes. The original source, however, quoted the lethal dose of sodium bisulfite by intravenous injection in rabbits weighing approximately 1. 5 kgm. as being 3 to 4 ml. of a solution containing 2. 96 per cent SO, when given at a rate of 1 ml. per minute (Rost and Franz, 1904).

Boyd and Reed presented evidence that both gaseous (hydrogen) and non-gaseous electromotively active systems {{are responsible for the}} potentials observed at different periods of growth in anaerobic cultures of Esch. coli. The studies to be reported here were confined to the potentials developed in stationary and continuous flow cultures of Esch. coli in peptone, a somewhat less complex medium than those employed by other investigators. It has been reported (Clifton, 1933 a) that broth cultures of Staphylococcus aureus in or near the maximum stationary growth phase reduce potassium ferricyanide at a rate in the neighborhood of 6. 6 X 10 - 14 <b>millimols</b> per cell per minute. These studies have been extended to the rates of reduction of ferricyanide at different stages of growth in stationary and continuous flow cul-tures of Esch. coli.

In this study, an efficient adsorbent based on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) nanofibers was developed following a cheap, versatile and scalable process. PET nanofibers were first produced by electrospinning, and their surface was chemically functionalized using a simple aminolysis process. The capacity of the resulting material to adsorb Pb(II) from synthetic solutions was evaluated {{as a function of}} the contact time, pH, and initial metal ion concentration. The adsorbent system presented a quick kinetic adsorption, reaching an extremely high maximum adsorption capacity of about 50 <b>millimol</b> (mmol) of Pb(II) per gram of adsorbent system after just 30 min. Moreover, the effect of competing metal ions, such as Ni(II), Cd(II) and Cu(II), was studied at different molar ratios.

The coupling of the regeneration of uridine-Sldiphospho-glucose (UDP-Glc) with {{synthesis of}} the disaccharide offers a practical route to <b>millimol</b> quantities of these carbohydrates.

Although these sugars are readily isolated in high purity and in large quantities from natural sources (sucrose is ubiquitous among plants (1); trehalose is abundant in fungi and insects (2)), their syntheses are still difficult chemically.

Nor-mal development was suppressed by beta- 2 -thienylalanine (1 or 2 <b>millimols</b> per liter), but it proceeded when phenylalanine and beta- 2 -thienylalanine {{were present in}} equimolar con-centrations. This effect {{may have been due}} to interference with protein metabolism in the dermal papillar cells. The nature of tissue interactions among em-bryonic tissues of diverse origin, which result in the development of complex adult struc-tures, {{is one of the major}} biological problems being investigated today. The most commonly encountered tissue interactions are epithelio-mesenchymal. These interactions are respon-sible for the initiation of development of such organs as pancreas, kidneys, and salivary glands. Billingham and Silvers 1 recently have discussed the vertebrate skin and have pointed out the research potential of this organ. A diversity of integumental derivatives, such as hair, teeth, and nails, develops from an os-tensibly uniform embryonic source. Thus, the mammalian skin provides the investigator with a means of comparing the ontogeny of several unique adult structures arising from an undifferentiated ectoderm. Virtually noth-ing is known about the tissue interactions that may be responsible for the differentiation of the integumental adnexa. The development of tooth germs has been the subject of a number of descriptive 24 and experimental analyses.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown (1) that {{methylene}} blue added to living cells increases their oxygen consumption, the increase being {{partly due to the}} oxidation of some of the decomposition products of the carbohydrate metabolism (2). It was then suggested (3) that the action of methylene blue was due to its reversibility with respect to oxidation, which enabled it to play the r 61 e of catalyst in the presence of atmospheric oxygen. It was of interest to study the relation between the reduction potential of the dye and its catalytic power and to correlate these properties with the reduction intensity in the cell. The most suitable material for this purpose is the mature unfertilized eggs of starfish (Asterias forbesii). Their pH value and reduction intensity have been studied and their active respiration allows accurate measurements of oxygen consumption; furthermore, the more or less transparent protoplasm of the eggs makes it easy to observe the penetration of the dye through the cell wall. The eggs of the same starfish were used in each series of experiments. They were collected in fiat-bottomed dishes, washed once with sea water, and after 40 to 50 minutes (time necessary for maturation) the experiments were started. The oxygen consumption was measured at 25 °C. :t: 0. 01 in Warburg's vessels with Barcroft micromanometers. Freshly prepared dyes were used at a concentration of 1. 253 <b>millimols</b> per liter.

In ad-dition to the well known increase in oxygen com-bining capacity which occurs during childhood and adolescence, Robinson found moderately lower mean values for hemoglobin saturation in adults above 40 years of age, and slightly higher mean values for arterial CO 2 content and CO 2 tension in adults as compared with children. In {{the case of the}} alkaline reserve, mean values varied be-tween 21. 2 and 22. 2 <b>millimols</b> per liter for all age groups except the youngest. Robinson found un-usually low values of alkaline reserve in children 4 to 6 years of age. The present study was under-taken to supplement the work of Robinson in the years of childhood and adolescence, in order to establish more firmly the range of variation that may be expected in healthy children, and to pro-vide a basis for the study of arterial blood gases and acid base balance in disease. MATERIAL The subjects of the study were drawn from three sources: 1. Children of 10 years and younger were of both sexes. They had been carefully selected from patients at Bobs Roberts Memorial Hospital as representing physiologically normal states at the time the blood samples were drawn.

40|$|There is no {{evidence}} in the literature that methemoglobin is accumulative in man from repeated administrations of acetanilide (1) or acetophenetidine in ordinary therapeutic doses. The possibility exists, however, that if the dose is large a progressive rise may occur.

40|$|Moderate {{amounts of}} KH 2 PO 4 (0. 5 to 0. 7 <b>millimols)</b> caused iron {{chlorosis}} of seedlings in solutions less acid than pH 5. 5 - 6. 0. The trouble {{could be avoided}} by omitting the phosphorus entirely and adding it separately after 2 - 4 days. Even with this modification the Knop type of solution (Hoagland, 2) caused persistent chlorosis in soybeans and broccoli. In the commonly used Shive solution (R 5 -C 2) a large excess of KH 2 PO 4 holds the pH of the solution between 4. 5 and 5. 0 and chlorosis is moderate to slight. The Shive solution contains 36 times as much phosphorus as the Hoagland and 6 -week-old plants growing in it absorbed 15 times as much to make a slightly poorer growth. The addition of as little as 0. 125 g per liter of NH 4 NO 3 resulted in decidedly acid solutions in every experiment with nine plant species representing seven families. Initial pH's of 5. 25 in an unbuffered solution fell to minimums of 3. 9 to 2. 9 and then rose, to pH 5. 0 or 6. 0 with large plants. The low pH's were shown {{to be due to}} a preferential absorption of NH+ 4 ion and the later rise to the slower absorption of the NO- 3 ion. The use of NH 4 NO 3 prevented iron chlorosis with some plants, notably soybeans, but resulted in acidities which were injurious to young corn and to cotton. In work done in this series but not described above, the "X" solution containing NH 4 NO 3 gave exceptional growth of young coffee (Coffea arabica), but was toxic to older plants. It is probable that iron chlorosis has more effect on solution culture results than any other single factor, and frequently than all other factors. Iron absorption from cultures is reduced by phosphorus, probably by H 2 PO- 4 ions especially, at pH's of about 6. 0 or higher. The use of Ca 3 (PO 4) 2 reduces the trouble as does the use of enough KH 2 PO 4 to maintain a pH below 5. 5. In tank culture H 2 SO 4 may be used more cheaply to accomplish the same result. In miscellaneous work with the Knop type of solution chlorosis can be reduced or prevented by omitting phosphorus from the solution and adding it separately 2 - 4 days later after iron has been absorbed...|$|R
