25|$|The {{study of}} {{background}} music {{focuses on the}} impact of music with non-musical tasks, including changes in behavior in the presence of different types, settings, or styles of music. In laboratory settings, music can affect performance on cognitive tasks (memory, attention, and comprehension), both positively and negatively. Used extensively as an advertising aid, music may also affect marketing strategies, ad comprehension, and consumer choices. Background music can influence learning, working memory and recall, performance while working on tests, and attention in cognitive <b>monitoring</b> <b>tasks.</b> Background music can also be used as a way to relieve boredom, create positive moods, and maintain a private space. Background music has been shown to put a restless mind at ease by presenting the listener with various melodies and tones.|$|E

On the 767-400ER, the cockpit layout is simplified further with six Rockwell Collins liquid crystal display (LCD) screens, and adapted for similarities with the 777 and the Next Generation 737. To retain operational commonality, the LCD screens can be programmed to display information {{in the same manner}} as earlier 767s. In 2012, Boeing and Rockwell Collins launched a further 787-based cockpit upgrade for the 767, featuring three landscape-format LCD screens that can display two windows each.|$|E

40|$|Multitasking {{requires}} {{individuals to}} allocate their cognitive resources across different tasks. The {{purpose of the}} current study was to assess school-age children’s multitasking abilities during degraded speech recognition. Children (8 to 12 years old) completed a dual-task paradigm including a sentence recognition (primary) task containing speech that was either unpro- cessed or noise-band vocoded with 8, 6, or 4 spectral channels and a visual <b>monitoring</b> (secondary) <b>task.</b> Children’s accuracy and reaction time on the visual <b>monitoring</b> <b>task</b> was quantified during the dual-task paradigm in each condition of the primary task and compared with single-task performance. Children experienced dual-task costs in the 6 - and 4 -channel conditions of the primary speech recognition task with decreased accuracy on the visual <b>monitoring</b> <b>task</b> relative to baseline performance. In all conditions, children’s dual-task performance on the visual <b>monitoring</b> <b>task</b> was strongly predicted by their single-task (baseline) performance on the task. Results suggest that children’s proficiency with the secondary task contributes to the magnitude of dual-task costs while multitasking during degraded speech recognition...|$|R

40|$|Health Manager {{can detect}} Bad Health {{prior to a}} failure {{occurring}} by periodically monitoring the application software by looking for code corruption errors, and sanity-checking each critical data value prior to use. A processor s memory can fail and corrupt the software, or the software can accidentally write to the wrong address and overwrite the executing software. This innovation will continuously calculate a checksum of the software load to detect corrupted code. This will allow a system to detect a failure before it happens. This innovation <b>monitors</b> each software <b>task</b> (thread) so that if any task reports "bad health," or does not report to the Health Manager, the system is declared bad. The Health Manager reports overall system health {{to the outside world}} by outputting a square wave signal. If the square wave stops, this indicates that system health is bad or hung and cannot report. Either way, "bad health" can be detected, whether caused by an error, corrupted data, or a hung processor. A separate Health <b>Monitor</b> <b>Task</b> is started and run periodically in a loop that starts and stops pending on a semaphore. Each <b>monitored</b> <b>task</b> registers with the Health Manager, which maintains a count for the task. The registering task must indicate if it will run more or less often than the Health Manager. If the task runs more often than the Health Manager, the <b>monitored</b> <b>task</b> calls a health function that increments the count and verifies it did not go over max-count. When the periodic Health Manager runs, it verifies that the count did not go over the max-count and zeroes it. If the task runs less often than the Health Manager, the periodic Health Manager will increment the count. The <b>monitored</b> <b>task</b> zeroes the count, and both the Health Manager and <b>monitored</b> <b>task</b> verify that the count did not go over the max-count...|$|R

40|$|POMDPs are {{a useful}} model for {{decision}} making in systems with uncertain states. One of the core tasks in a POMDP is the <b>monitoring</b> <b>task,</b> in which the belief state (i. e. the probability distribution over system states) is updated based on incomplete and noisy observations. This can be a hard problem in complex real-world systems due to the often very large state space. In this paper, we explore the idea of accelerating the <b>monitoring</b> <b>task</b> by automatically exploiting causality in the system. We consider {{a specific type of}} causal relation, called passivity, which pertains to how system variables cause changes in other variables. We present a novel monitoring method, called Passivity-based Monitoring (PM), which maintains a factored belief state representation and exploits passivity to perform selective updates over the factored beliefs. PM produces exact belief states under certain assumptions and approximate belief states otherwise, where the approximation error is bounded by the degree of uncertainty in the process. We show empirically, in synthetic processes with varying sizes and degrees of passivity, that PM is faster than two standard monitoring methods while achieving competitive accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate how passivity occurs naturally in a real-world system such as a multi-robot warehouse, and how PM can exploit this to accelerate the <b>monitoring</b> <b>task.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|Twenty pilots searched {{through a}} 280 screen hierarchically {{organized}} data base of flight information in single task conditions, and in dual-task conditions which required concurrent monitoring of an altitude variable. Two screens were available that could either be shared {{between the two}} tasks, or fully allocated to the information access task (IAT).

Subjects performed the dual task trials under either information or <b>monitoring</b> <b>task</b> emphasis, and when the <b>monitoring</b> <b>task</b> was either low or high bandwidth. The results indicated that longer single task traversals resulted from integration problems, from more distant nodes, and from nodes that shared the same top level of the hierarchy. The dual task results indicated that a measured strategic variable which facilitated performance on the IAT (the devotion of both screens to that task) was modulated as the IAT became more difficult with integration questions, as the IAT was emphasized, and as the <b>monitoring</b> <b>task</b> was at lower bandwidth. However, the result revealed that pilots failed to consider the length of the data base navigational path in their choice of single versus dual screen strategy...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a new version}} of the phoneme <b>monitoring</b> <b>task</b> that is well-suited for the study of lexical processing. The {{generalized}} phoneme <b>monitoring</b> (GPM) <b>task,</b> in which subjects detect target phonemes appearing anywhere in the test words, was shown to be sensitive to associative context effects. In Experiment 1, using the standard phoneme monitoring procedure in which subjects detect only word-initial targets, no effect of associative context was obtained. In contrast, clear context effects were observed in Experiment 2, which used the GPM task. Subjects responded faster to word-initial and word-medial targets when the target-bearing words were preceded by an associatively related word than when preceded by an unrelated one. The differential effect of context in the two versions of the phoneme <b>monitoring</b> <b>task</b> was interpreted with reference to task demands and their role in directing selective attention. Experiment 3 showed that the size of the context effect was unaffected by the proportion of related words in the experiment, suggesting that the observed effects were not due to subject strategies...|$|R
