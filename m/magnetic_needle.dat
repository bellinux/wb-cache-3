5|$|Later {{on in the}} Song dynasty {{the compass}} was used with {{maritime}} navigation. Several decades after the Wujing Zongyao was written, the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (1031–1095 AD) wrote of the first truly magnetized compass needle in his book Dream Pool Essays (1088 AD). With a more efficient compass magnetized by lodestone, the thermoremanence compass fell out of use. The later maritime author Zhu Yu soon wrote of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>needle</b> compass {{as a means to}} navigate at sea, in his book Pingzhou Table Talks of 1119 AD.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese of the Song dynasty were adept sailors who {{traveled}} to {{ports of call}} {{as far away as}} Fatimid Egypt. They were well equipped for their journeys abroad, in large seagoing vessels steered by stern-post rudders and guided by the directional compass. Even before Shen Kuo and Zhu Yu had described the mariner's <b>magnetic</b> <b>needle</b> compass, the earlier military treatise of the Wujing Zongyao in 1044 had also described a thermoremanence compass. This was a simple iron or steel needle that was heated, cooled, and placed in a bowl of water, producing the effect of weak magnetization, although its use was described only for navigation on land and not at sea.|$|E
25|$|Developed by Peltier, this uses {{a form of}} {{magnetic}} compass to measure deflection by balancing the electrostatic force with a <b>magnetic</b> <b>needle.</b>|$|E
50|$|Later books {{continue}} this format. For example, the second book, Mark the Mountain Guide and the Compass Adventure, includes a working compass & brief illustrated {{explanations of the}} history, science & technique behind <b>magnetic</b> <b>needles</b> used for navigation.|$|R
50|$|An astatic system {{comprises}} two {{equal and}} parallel <b>magnetic</b> <b>needles,</b> but with their polarities reversed. This arrangement protects the {{system from the}} influence of the terrestrial magnetic field, as the magnetisms of the two needles cancel each other out. Because of this phenomenon, astatic needles were often used in galvanometers.|$|R

We should have been pleased to learn whether {{the human body is}} more like a loadstone, a voltaic pile, or an electrical machine; whether the organs are to be regarded as Leyden jars, <b>magnetic</b> <b>needles,</b> or batteries.” ...|$|R
25|$|The 11th-century Chinese {{scientist}} Shen Kuo was {{the first}} person to write – in the Dream Pool Essays – of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>needle</b> compass and that it improved the accuracy of navigation by employing the astronomical concept of true north.|$|E
25|$|For most of Chinese history, {{the compass}} that {{remained}} in use {{was in the}} form of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>needle</b> floating in a bowl of water. According to Needham, the Chinese in the Song Dynasty and continuing Yuan Dynasty did make use of a dry compass, although this type never became as widely used in China as the wet compass.|$|E
25|$|A {{magnetic}} rod is required when constructing a compass. This {{can be created}} by aligning an iron or steel rod with Earth's magnetic field and then tempering or striking it. However, this method produces only a weak magnet so other methods are preferred. For example, a magnetised rod can be created by repeatedly rubbing an iron rod with a magnetic lodestone. This magnetised rod (or <b>magnetic</b> <b>needle)</b> is then placed on a low friction surface {{to allow it to}} freely pivot to align itself with the magnetic field. It is then labeled so the user can distinguish the north-pointing from the south-pointing end; in modern convention the north end is typically marked in some way.|$|E
3000|$|... (c) Experimenting: In Faraday's case, {{he used a}} lot of {{exploratory}} experiments; in case {{of lines}} of magnetic force, he used, e.g., iron filings, <b>magnetic</b> <b>needles,</b> or current carrying wires (see the quote above). The magnetic field is not directly observable and the representation of lines of force was a visual model, which includes the direction, form, and magnitude of field.|$|R
6000|$|This {{note was}} written upon gilt-edged paper [...] With a neat little crow-quill, slight and new: [...] Her small white hand could hardly reach the taper, [...] It trembled as <b>magnetic</b> <b>needles</b> do, [...] And yet {{she did not}} let one tear escape her; [...] The seal a sun-flower; 'Elle vous suit partout,' [...] The motto cut upon a white cornelian; [...] The wax was superfine, its hue vermilion.|$|R

If {{the wire}} NP (fig. 40.) have an {{electric}} current passed through {{it in the}} direction from P to N, then the dotted ring may represent a magnetic curve round it, {{and it is in}} such a direction that if small <b>magnetic</b> <b>needles</b> lie placed as tangents to it, they will become arranged as in the figure, n and s indicating north and south ends (14. note.).|$|R
25|$|A solar compass is a {{railroad}} compass with a solar attachment that allows surveyors {{to determine the}} north direction by reference to the sun rather than by reference to the <b>magnetic</b> <b>needle.</b> It consists of three arcs: one for setting the latitude of the land to be surveyed; one for setting the declination of the sun; and one for setting the hour of the day. In 1835, the solar compass was invented by William Austin Burt, a U.S. Deputy Surveyor who began surveying government lands in the Michigan Territory earlier in 1833. While experiencing great difficulty in using his standard vernier compass in order to detect deposits of iron ore in the Northwest Territory (present-day Wisconsin), Burt devised the solar compass so that garbled readings of the Earth's magnetic field and north-south survey lines {{would be easier to}} find. A patent was issued to Burt on February 25, 1836.|$|E
25|$|The five-needle telegraph, {{which was}} mainly, if not entirely, due to Wheatstone, {{was similar to}} that of Schilling, and based on the {{principle}} enunciated by André-Marie Ampère – that is to say, the current was sent into the line by completing the circuit of the battery with a make and break key, and at the other end it passed through a coil of wire surrounding a <b>magnetic</b> <b>needle</b> free to turn round its centre. According as one pole of the battery or the other was applied to the line by means of the key, the current deflected the needle to one side or the other. There were five separate circuits actuating five different needles. The latter were pivoted in rows across the middle of a dial shaped like a diamond, and having the letters of the alphabet arranged upon {{it in such a way}} that a letter was literally pointed out by the current deflecting two of the needles towards it.|$|E
25|$|Early {{attempts}} to quantitatively describe the electromagnetic force {{were made in}} the mid-18th century. It was proposed that the force on magnetic poles, by Johann Tobias Mayer and others in 1760, and electrically charged objects, by Henry Cavendish in 1762, obeyed an inverse-square law. However, in both cases the experimental proof was neither complete nor conclusive. It was not until 1784 when Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, using a torsion balance, was able to definitively show through experiment that this was true. Soon after the discovery in 1820 by H. C. Ørsted that a <b>magnetic</b> <b>needle</b> is acted on by a voltaic current, André-Marie Ampère that same year was able to devise through experimentation the formula for the angular dependence of the force between two current elements. In all these descriptions, the force was always given in terms of the properties of the objects involved and the distances between them rather than in terms of electric and magnetic fields.|$|E
5000|$|The Admiralty {{once again}} {{instructed}} {{the participants to}} gather such scientific data as [...] "must prove most valuable and interesting to the science of our country." [...] They were to {{pay particular attention to}} magnetic measurements, especially the possible interactions between <b>magnetic</b> <b>needles,</b> atmospheric electricity and the aurora borealis. They were also to attempt to establish the location of the Earth's North Magnetic Pole, then believed to lie somewhere along the western shore of Baffin Bay.|$|R
5000|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{now known}} as geomagnetically induced current was seen {{for the first time}} during this cycle - it became apparent on the emerging electric telegraph network. Francis Ronalds, Honorary Director of the Kew Observatory and Sabine’s colleague, received data from telegraph operators on the movements of their <b>magnetic</b> <b>needles</b> for comparison with his own photo-recordings of atmospheric electricity and geomagnetic intensity variations but had insufficient resources to study the causes of the unexpected currents in detail.|$|R
500|$|The Cooke and Wheatstone {{telegraph}} {{consisted of}} a number of <b>magnetic</b> <b>needles</b> which could be made to turn a short distance either clockwise or anti-clockwise by electromagnetic induction from an energising winding. [...] The direction of movement was determined by the direction of the current in the telegraph wires. [...] The board was marked with a diamond shaped grid with a letter at each grid intersection, and so arranged that when two needles were energised they would point to a specific letter.|$|R
500|$|However, it was {{not until}} the time of Shen Kuo that the {{earliest}} magnetic compasses would be used for navigation. In his written work, Shen Kuo made the first known explicit reference to the magnetic compass-needle and the concept of true north. He wrote that steel needles were magnetized once they were rubbed with lodestone, and that they were put in floating position or in mountings; he described the suspended compass as the best form to be used, and noted that the <b>magnetic</b> <b>needle</b> of compasses pointed either south or north. Shen Kuo asserted that the needle will point south but with a deviation, stating [...] " [...] are always displaced slightly east rather than pointing due south." ...|$|E
500|$|In his Dream Pool Essays or Dream Torrent Essays ( [...] ; Mengxi Bitan) of 1088, Shen was {{the first}} to {{describe}} the <b>magnetic</b> <b>needle</b> compass, which would be used for navigation (first described in Europe by Alexander Neckam in 1187). Shen discovered the concept of true north in terms of magnetic declination towards the north pole, with experimentation of suspended magnetic needles and [...] "the improved meridian determined by Shen's [...] measurement of the distance between the pole star and true north". This was the decisive step in human history to make compasses more useful for navigation, and may have been a concept unknown in Europe for another four hundred years (evidence of German sundials made circa 1450 show markings similar to Chinese geomancer compasses in regard to declination).|$|E
500|$|Polymath geniuses – that is, people {{knowledgeable}} {{across an}} encyclopaedic {{range of topics}} – such as Shen Kuo (1031–1095) and Su Song (1020–1101) embodied the spirit of early empirical science and technology in the Song era. Shen is famous for discovering the concept of true north and magnetic declination towards the North Pole by calculating a more accurate measurement of the astronomical meridian, and fixed the calculated position of the pole star that had shifted over the centuries. This allowed sailors to navigate the seas more accurately with the <b>magnetic</b> <b>needle</b> compass, also first described by Shen. [...] Shen was made famous for his written description of Bi Sheng, the inventor of movable type printing. Shen was also interested in geology, as he formulated a theory of geomorphology and climate change over time after making observations of strange natural phenomena. Using contemporary knowledge of solar eclipses and lunar eclipses, he theorized that the sun and moon were spherical in shape, not flat, while expanding upon the reasoning of earlier Chinese astronomical theorists. Along with his colleague Wei Pu in the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen used cosmological hypotheses when describing the variations of planetary motion, including retrogradation. One of Shen's greatest achievements, aided by Wei Pu, was correcting the lunar error by diligently recording and plotting the moon's orbital path three times a night {{over a period of}} five years. Unfortunately Shen had many political rivals at court who were determined to sabotage his work. The court fully accepted their corrections to lunar and solar error, but only partially adopted Shen and Wei's corrected plotting of the planetary orbital paths and various speeds.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{a compass}} as a {{direction}} finder underground was pioneered in the Tuscan mining town Massa where floating <b>magnetic</b> <b>needles</b> were employed for tunnelling, and for defining {{the claims of the}} various mining companies, as early as the 13th century. In {{the second half of the}} 15th century, the compass became standard equipment for Tyrolian miners. Shortly afterwards the first detailed treatise dealing with the underground use of compasses was published by a German miner Rülein von Calw (1463-1525).|$|R

50|$|Barlow's {{work was}} on {{practical}} aspects of magnetism: {{improvements in the}} hanging of compasses at sea, for {{the discovery of the}} difference between iron and steel for magnetic purposes, and for the proper way of touching <b>magnetic</b> <b>needles,</b> and of piercing and cementing lodestones. He corresponded with William Gilbert. A controversy arose between Barlow and Mark Ridley, who published a reply to Barlow's Magnetical Advertisements, charging him with plagiarism, not only of Gilbert's work De Magnete (1600), but of his own book, Magnetical Bodies and Motions (1613). Barlow made a stinging reply. The work had in fact its origins in a manuscript he had prepared in 1609 for Sir Thomas Chaloner; Chaloner may have found him the position as chaplain to Prince Henry.|$|R
500|$|Although {{an ancient}} {{hematite}} artifact from the Olmec era in Mexico dating to roughly 1000 BC indicates the possible {{use of the}} lodestone compass long before it was described in China, the Olmecs did not have iron which the Chinese would discover could be magnetised by contact with lodestone. Descriptions of lodestone attracting iron {{were made in the}} Guanzi, Master Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals and Huainanzi. The Chinese by the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) began using north-south oriented lodestone ladle-and-bowl shaped compasses for divination and geomancy and not yet for navigation. The Lunheng, written by Han dynasty writer, scientist, and philosopher Wang Chong (27– c. 100 AD) stated in chapter 52: [...] "This instrument resembles a spoon and when it is placed on a plate on the ground, the handle points to the south". There are, however, another two references under chapter 47 of the same text to the attractive power of a magnet according to Needham (1986), but Li Shu-hua (1954) considers it to be lodestone, and states that there is no explicit mention of a magnet in Lunheng. Shen Kuo (1031–1095) of the Song Dynasty (960–1279) was the first to accurately describe both magnetic declination (in discerning true north) and the <b>magnetic</b> <b>needle</b> compass in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088, while the Song dynasty writer Zhu Yu (fl. 12th century) was the first to mention use of the compass specifically for navigation at sea in his book published in 1119. Even before this, however, the Wujing Zongyao military manuscript compiled by 1044 described a thermoremanence compass of heated iron or steel shaped as a fish and placed in a bowl of water which produced a weak magnetic force via remanence and induction; the Wujing Zongyao recorded that it was used as a pathfinder along with the mechanical south-pointing chariot.|$|E
2500|$|Hans Christian Ørsted's {{discovery}} of the magnetic effect of electric currents in 1820 was immediately recognised as an important advance, although he left further work on electromagnetism to others. André-Marie Ampère quickly repeated Ørsted's experiment, and formulated them mathematically (which became Ampère's law) [...] Ørsted also discovered {{that not only is}} a <b>magnetic</b> <b>needle</b> deflected by the electric current, but that the live electric wire is also deflected in a magnetic field, thus laying the foundation for the construction of an electric motor.

2500|$|Robert's two hydrogen-balloon {{flights in}} Hamburg, {{a third in}} St. Petersburg and a fourth in Riga were claimed to be [...] "scientific" [...] by himself.

6000|$|... 1679. The {{particles}} of an insulating dielectric whilst under induction may {{be compared to}} a series of small <b>magnetic</b> <b>needles,</b> or more correctly still {{to a series of}} small insulated conductors. If the space round a charged globe were filled with a mixture of an insulating dielectric, as oil of turpentine or air, and small globular conductors, as shot, the latter being at a little distance from each other so as to be insulated, then these would in their condition and action exactly resemble what I consider to be the condition and action of the {{particles of}} the insulating dielectric itself (1337.). If the globe were charged, these little conductors would all be polar; if the globe were discharged, they would all return to their normal state, to be polarized again upon the recharging of the globe. The state developed by induction through such particles on a mass of conducting mutter at a distance would be of the contrary kind, and exactly equal in amount to the force in the inductric globe. There would be a lateral diffusion of force (1224. 1297.), because each polarized sphere would be in an active or tense relation to all those contiguous to it, just as one magnet can affect two or more <b>magnetic</b> <b>needles</b> near it, and these again a still greater number beyond them. Hence would result the production of curved lines of inductive force if the inducteous body in such a mixed dielectric were an uninsulated metallic ball (1219. &c.) or other properly shaped mass. Such curved lines are the consequences of the two electric forces arranged as I have assumed them to be: and, that the inductive force can be directed in such curved lines is the strongest proof of the presence of the two powers and the polar condition of the dielectric particles.|$|R

50|$|The North Magnetic Pole is {{the point}} {{on the surface of}} Earth's Northern Hemisphere at which the planet's {{magnetic}} field points vertically downwards (in other words, if a <b>magnetic</b> compass <b>needle</b> is allowed to rotate about a horizontal axis, it will point straight down).

2500|$|A lodestone compass {{was used}} in China during the Han Dynasty between the 2nd century BC and 1st century AD, where {{it was called the}} [...] "south-governor" [...] (sīnán [...] ).

50|$|The {{locations}} of geomagnetic poles are {{predicted by the}} International Geomagnetic Reference Field, a statistical fit to measurements of the Earth's field by satellites and in geomagnetic observatories. If the Earth's field were exactly dipolar, the north pole of a <b>magnetic</b> compass <b>needle</b> would point directly at the North Geomagnetic Pole. In practice it does not because the geomagnetic field that originates in the core has a more complex non-dipolar part, and magnetic anomalies in the Earth's crust {{also contribute to the}} local field.|$|R
50|$|The flow {{direction}} is detected by a <b>magnetic</b> compass, a <b>needle</b> clamped onto a potentiometer.
