Physical systems that in some basis are inherently anti-symmetric are already known to be useful for quantum information processing. Supersymmetric systems may be likewise.

40|$|Background. In {{patients}} with the preexcitation syndrome who are undergoing transcatheter or surgical ablation, accurate localization of accessory pathways is critical. Because preexcitation is known to alter ventricular activation sequence and result in focal areas with presystolic contraction, we investigated whether phase analysis applied to two-dimensional echocardio-graphic cine loops objectively identifies these focal areas {{and can be used}} to localize ventricular insertion sites of accessory pathways. Methods and Results. We prospectively obtained phase images in 17 patients (11 males; age range, 11 - 35 years) during minimal preexcitation in normal sinus rhythm and during maximal preexcitation induced by right atrial pacing. A group of 11 normal subjects (six men; age range, 26 - 37 years) served as controls.

40|$|A novel {{analytical}} method, using turbidometry, {{for reporting}} the time-dependent decay in the threshold concentration of adenosine diphosphate (ADP), required to elicit a secondary aggregation response in fresh human citrated platelet-rich plasma (PRP), is described. The phenomenon, called "transient aggregation resistance" (TAR) ends, usually within one hour after venepuncture, {{in a steady}} state or "baseline aggregation resistance" (BAR). Back extrapolation of the <b>mathematically</b> <b>transformed</b> data to t = 0, yields a maximal threshold concentration of ADP, representing the initial aggregation resistance (TARmax) {{at the time of}} blood withdrawal, which threshold is usually many orders of magnitude higher than the BAR-value. The exponential decay of TAR can be characterized by its half-life (t 1 / 2). Mixing fresh, rapidly prepared, plasma with PRP, kept long enough to show only the stable low BAR-value, could restore the initial high (transient) aggregation resistance found in fresh PRP, suggesting that it concerns a natural, labile plasmatic factor. One hour old PRP, deliberately made refractory to ADP, did not show the TAR phenomenon again, but had a higher BAR-value.

The goal {{of this study is}} to design a state feedback control law at each decision step to enhance safety, comfort, and energy efficiency of high speed train subject to safety constraints on the control input.

Furthermore, we analyze the influences of second-order actuator dynamics on the fuzzy constrained predictive controller, which shows risk of potentially deteriorating the overall system. Employing backstepping method, an actuator compensator is proposed to accommodate for the influence of the actuator dynamics.

40|$|In QTL {{analysis}} of non-normally distributed phenotypes, non-parametric approaches {{have been proposed}} {{as an alternative to}} the use of parametric tests on <b>mathematically</b> <b>transformed</b> data. The non-parametric interval mapping test uses random ranking to deal with ties. Another approach is to assign to each tied individual the average of the tied ranks (midranks). This approach is implemented and compared to the random ranking approach in terms of statistical power and accuracy of the QTL position. Non-normal phenotypes such as bacteria counts showing high numbers of zeros are simulated (0 - 80 % zeros). We show that, for low proportions of zeros, the power estimates are similar but, for high proportions of zeros, the midrank approach is superior to the random ranking approach. For example, with a QTL accounting for 8 % of the total phenotypic variance, a gain from 8 % to 11 % of power can be obtained. Furthermore, the accuracy of the estimated QTL location is increased when using midranks. Therefore, if non-parametric interval mapping is chosen, the midrank approach should be preferred.
