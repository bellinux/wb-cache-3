40|$|A {{survey of}} {{geomagnetic}} dip was repeated by the dip circle {{used in the}} first survey in 1939. Remarkable changes in dip were not observed at any place in the Sakura-zima Island but one situated quite near the new lavaflow. By another dip-survey across {{the north side of}} the newlava, it was found that the lava was magnetized in the direction of the present geomagnetic field as a whole, and its intensity of magnetization calculated from the observed anomaly was 0. 005 ± 0. 001 e. m. u. Measurement of tilt of the ground was also repeated in the same manner as in April. Most of bench-marks having bean destroyed, during Apr. ～Oct., only three groups of them remained. At these stations, the ground tilted towards the same direction as before(See Fig. 4), and its daily rate of the tilt decreased to 1 / 9 of that of April. The topographic distribution of direction of tilt suggests that the island consists of more than three blocks. A topographic survey near the new crater was carried out by a <b>mountain</b> <b>barometer</b> and a clinometer...|$|E

Giblin, Piesse and Hutcliisou, {{in their}} {{paper on the}} Heighit of Ben Lomond (ante, pp. 5 - 14), refer, at p. 13, to Count Strzelecki's {{determinations}} of the heights of several summits on Ben Lomond. Couut Strzelecki, in 1841, determined many heights in Tasmania. These {{were published in the}} Tasmanian Journal, i., 147 - 9, and afterwards in the work quoted on p. 13. These heights, though determined with great care by the use of Gav Lussac's syphon <b>mountain</b> <b>barometers</b> and Wollaston's boiling point apparatus, dififer considerably from the heights found subsequently in the trigonometrical survey...|$|R

The Perth gasworks were originally constructed under his superintendence, and he introduced many improvements leading to the economical production of gas. He wrote the articles [...] "Barometer", [...] "Cold", [...] "Dyeing", [...] "Fermentation", [...] "Evaporation", [...] "Hygrometry", [...] "Navigation", and [...] "Physical Geography" [...] in Brewster's Edinburgh Encyclopædia (completed 1830), and the article [...] "Gaslight" [...] in the Encyclopædia Britannica.|$|R

This {{paper is}} focused on the various {{instruments}} and measuring devices that travellers took with them to the top of <b>mountains,</b> such as <b>barometers,</b> thermometers, hygrometers and other meteorological devices. It aims at investigating the transformation of instrumental practices by scientific travellers and natural philosophers between the late 17 th century {{and the end of the}} 18 th century. Focusing our attention particularly on thermometric and barometric measurements, we intend to analyse how measuring and quantifying practices were related to philosophical assumptions about order in nature, and how within the new ethos of precision and accuracy they contributed, in turn, to reshape the perception of nature and the relationship between man and nature.
