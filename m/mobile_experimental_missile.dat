The aircraft, a Vickers Viscount 803 named [...] "St. Phelim", crashed into the sea off Tuskar Rock, County Wexford. Although {{the investigation into the}} crash lasted two years, a cause was never determined. There has long been popular speculation that the aircraft was shot down by a British <b>experimental</b> <b>missile.</b> Aberporth in West Wales was at the time the most advanced British missile testing station.|$|R
50|$|BPD {{played an}} {{important}} role in developing missile solid fuels. In 1952, on behalf of the Aeronautica Militare, BPD patented a solid fuel based on nitro-glycerine and cellulose nitrate, the first step in developing <b>experimental</b> <b>missiles</b> on an industrial scale. The Aeronautica_Militare also contracted BPD to develop a meteorological missile, called the 160-70, employing two propulsion systems. The 160-70 was successfully employed in many launches between 1961 and 1963. In 1961 state and private companies merged; publicly owned Finmeccanica and the private firms BPD and FIAT were incorporated into the Società Generale Missilistica Italiana.|$|R

5000|$|The Blackie Drago {{incarnation}} of Vulture (referred to as Vulture Man) {{appeared in the}} 1960s Spider-Man TV series, voiced by Gillie Fenwick. In the episode [...] "The Sky is Falling", he attacks the city with an army of vultures wanting a $2,000,000 ransom until they attack him due to Spider-Man sabotaging his control. He apparently escapes while fleeing the vultures, but Spider-Man gets the money back. In the episode [...] "The Vulture's Prey", Vulture commits penthouse robberies and traps J. Jonah Jameson in a clock tower after the man accidentally stumbles upon the Vulture's loot in there. He hears from Jameson about an <b>experimental</b> <b>missile</b> and steals it {{to try to help}} him commit crimes, using Jameson to inform him. He loses the missile due to Spider-Man. Jameson then causes the clock tower to go haywire, causing Spider-Man to go there after the Vulture, and web him up. In the episode [...] "To Catch a Spider", Dr. Noah Boddy frees him, Electro and the Green Goblin from prison by knocking a guard out and unlocking the doors. Vulture weakens Spider-Man with concussion bombs, before Electro challenges Spider-Man to a battle at midnight. Electro knocks him out after Spider-Man makes the villains fight using ventriloquism. All the villains are webbed up and arrested. In the episode [...] "The Winged Thing", Spider-Man sees him robbing a millionaire's penthouse, then putting into action the robbery of an <b>experimental</b> <b>missile</b> which is apparently going to be used to bring him down as part of a plot to steal an experimental device to control a flock of vultures.
