5|$|As {{is common}} for non-dominant wolf males, OR-7 left the Imnaha Pack in the Wallowa Mountains near Joseph in September 2011, presumably {{in search of a}} <b>mate.</b> <b>In</b> November, he became the first wolf {{detected}} in western Oregon in more than 60 years when he was photographed east of Butte Falls by an automatic trail camera. This marked the first known wild wolf presence in southwestern Oregon since 1946.|$|E

5|$|Males of fly {{species such}} as Cuterebra, many hover flies, bee flies (Bombyliidae) and fruit flies (Tephritidae) {{maintain}} territories within which they engage in aerial pursuit to drive away intruding males and other species. While these territories may be held by individual males, some species form leks with many males aggregating in displays. Some flies maintain an airspace and still others form dense swarms that maintain a stationary location with respect to landmarks. Many flies <b>mate</b> <b>in</b> flight while swarming.|$|E
5|$|On January 26, 2009, Lieutenant Governor Daniel Mongiardo {{announced}} that he would seek the Democratic nomination to challenge incumbent Senator Jim Bunning in the 2010 senatorial election.

5|$|The {{operational}} {{sex ratio}} in the {{poison dart frog}} family is mostly female biased. This leads to a few characteristic behaviors and traits found in organisms with an uneven sex ratio. In general, females {{have a choice of}} <b>mate.</b> <b>In</b> turn, males show brighter coloration, are territorial, and are aggressive toward other males. Females select mates based on coloration (mainly dorsal), calling perch location, and territory.|$|E
5|$|Albert Arnold Gore Jr. (born March 31, 1948) is an American {{politician}} and environmentalist {{who served as}} the 45th Vice President of the United States from 1993 to 2001. Gore was Bill Clinton's running <b>mate</b> <b>in</b> their successful campaign in 1992, and the pair were re-elected in 1996. Near the end of President Clinton's second term, Gore was selected as the Democratic nominee for the 2000 presidential election but did not win the election. After his term as vice-president ended in 2001, Gore remained prominent as an author and environmental activist, whose work in climate change activism earned him (jointly with the IPCC) the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Barkley {{was among}} 12 {{nominated}} at the 1944 Democratic National Convention {{to serve as}} Roosevelt's running <b>mate</b> <b>in</b> the presidential election that year, receiving six votes. Delegates favored dropping vice president Henry Wallace from their ticket in favor of Barkley, but Roosevelt refused to consider him, telling a July 11 meeting of Democratic leaders {{that he was too}} old. Instead, he took the recommendation of Democratic National Committee chairman Robert E. Hannegan and choose Harry S. Truman. Despite his differences with Roosevelt, Barkley faced no serious challengers in the 1944 Democratic primary and defeated his Republican challenger, Fayette County Commonwealth's Attorney James Park, by a vote of 464,053 to 380,425.|$|E

5|$|Cooper {{was opposed}} in his {{re-election}} bid by Democratic Congressman Virgil M. Chapman, {{an ally of}} Earle C. Clements, who had been elected governor in 1947. As {{one of only a}} few Democrats who had voted in favor of the Taft–Hartley Act, Chapman had lost the support of organized labor, a key constituency for the Democrats. The Democratic-leaning Louisville Times endorsed Cooper, but the presence of Kentucky's favorite son, Alben Barkley, on the ballot as Harry S. Truman's running <b>mate</b> <b>in</b> the 1948 presidential election ensured a strong Democratic turnout in the state. Both Barkley and Clements stressed party unity during the campaign, and although Cooper polled much better than the Republican presidential ticket, he ultimately lost to Chapman in the general election by 24,480 votes.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, Day-Lewis worked in theatre and {{television}} including Frost in May (where he played an impotent man-child) and How Many Miles to Babylon? (as a World War I officer torn between allegiances to Britain and Ireland) for the BBC. Eleven {{years after his}} film debut, Day-Lewis had a small part in the film Gandhi (1982) as Colin, a South African street thug who racially bullies the title character. In late 1982 he had his big theatre break {{when he took over}} the lead in Another Country. The following year, he had a supporting role as the conflicted, but ultimately loyal first <b>mate</b> <b>in</b> The Bounty, after which he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, playing Romeo in Romeo and Juliet and Flute in A Midsummer Night's Dream.|$|E
5|$|Hinde {{was born}} in Oxfordshire, England, in July 1737. He {{received}} a classical education in Oxfordshire and, after completing his studies, was sent to London, England to study medicine. He studied physics and surgery under Dr Thomas Brooke at Saint Thomas Hospital in London and, {{at the age of}} nineteen, was presented to the Company of Surgeons for a licence. Shortly after, he was commissioned as a Surgeons' <b>Mate</b> <b>in</b> the Royal Navy and sailed for America with the forces commanded by General Amherst. After landing in New York on June 10, 1757, he spent time at Halifax and Louisbourg. Hinde spent the winter of 1758 in Halifax and assisted Amherst with the reduction of Louisburg. He was attached to the ship which bore the commander in chief, General James Wolfe, on his way to Quebec.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, {{former vice}} {{president}} and presidential candidate Walter Mondale, seen as an underdog, selected Ferraro to be his running <b>mate</b> <b>in</b> the upcoming election. Ferraro became the only Italian American to be a major-party national nominee {{in addition to being}} the first woman. The positive polling the Mondale-Ferraro ticket received when she joined soon faded, as damaging questions arose about her and her businessman husband's finances and wealth and her Congressional disclosure statements. In the general election, Mondale and Ferraro were defeated in a landslide by incumbent President Ronald Reagan and Vice President George H. W. Bush.|$|E
5|$|In the Senate, Borah {{became one}} of the {{progressive}} insurgents who challenged President William Howard Taft's policies, though Borah refused to support former president Theodore Roosevelt's third-party bid against Taft in 1912. Borah reluctantly voted for war in 1917 and, once it concluded, he fought against the Versailles treaty, and the Senate did not ratify it. Remaining a maverick, Borah often fought with the Republican presidents in office between 1921 and 1933, though Coolidge offered to make Borah his running <b>mate</b> <b>in</b> 1924. Borah campaigned for Hoover in 1928, something he rarely did for presidential candidates and never did again.|$|E

5|$|Macaroni {{penguins}} moult once a year, {{a process}} in which they replace all of their old feathers. They spend around two weeks accumulating fat before moulting because they do not feed during the moult, as they cannot enter the water to forage for food without feathers. The process typically takes three to four weeks, which they spend sitting ashore. Once finished, they go back to sea and return to their colonies to <b>mate</b> <b>in</b> the spring. Overall survival rates are poorly known; the successful return of breeding adults at South Georgia Island varied between 49% and 78% over three years, and around 10% of those that did return did not breed the following year.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{possible}} explanations {{for the evolution of}} this sexual difference in bill shape. The most widely supported is that it allowed birds of different sexes to utilise different food sources. This divergence may have arisen {{because of a lack of}} competitors in these foraging niches in the North Island forest ecosystems. The other idea is that the ivory-coloured bill, which contrasted sharply with the bird's black plumage, may have been used to attract a <b>mate.</b> <b>In</b> animals that use sexually dimorphic physical traits to attract a mate, the dimorphic feature is often brightly coloured or contrasts with the rest of the body, as with the huia. It has been suggested that as the female was the main provider of food for the chicks by regurgitation, this sex evolved the longer bill to obtain the protein-rich invertebrate diet required for the chicks.|$|E
5|$|Bennett {{declined}} the offer to be Dole's running mate but suggested Kemp, a man described as Dole's antagonist. On August 16, 1996, the Republican Party chose Kemp as its vice presidential , running alongside former Senator Dole. Kemp {{was seen as}} a means to attract conservative and libertarian-minded voters like those of tough nomination-challengers Forbes and Pat Buchanan. Kemp was chosen over Connie Mack, John McCain, and Carroll Campbell, and it is assumed that this was partly because Kemp had several former staffers in influential positions as Dole's senior advisors. Dole had had a long history of representing the budget-balancing faction of the Party, while Kemp had had a long history of representing the tax-cutting advocates, and Kemp's tax-cutting fiscal track record was seen as the perfect fit for the ticket. When Kemp became Dole's running <b>mate</b> <b>in</b> 1996, they appeared {{on the cover of the}} August 19, 1996 issue of Time magazine, but the pair barely edged out a story on the reported discovery of extraterrestrial life on Mars, which was so close to being the cover story that Time inset it on the cover and wrote about how difficult the decision was.|$|E
