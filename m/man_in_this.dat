25|$|The species {{within the}} {{hymenopteran}} order commonly sting or bite others {{with which they}} interact. After a man was stung by a European hornet, he experienced tingling {{at the site of}} contact, as well as headaches and shortness of breath. In the hospital, he was found to have a fast, irregular heartbeat with a blood pressure of 111/63. His subsequent ECG demonstrated atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. V. crabro toxin contains neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenalineneurotoxin apamin, as well as enzymes phospholipase A and hyaluronidase, the compound histamine, and proteins melittin and bradykinin. These compounds have been shown to cause tachycardia episodes in smaller animals. The mechanism of this attack is still undetermined, but this man possibly was just more susceptible to vespine stings than other humans. Currently, the two most effective treatments are electrical cardioversion or propafenone. The <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case study was given an oral dose of propafenone (150mg) and his atrial fibrillation resolved.|$|E
25|$|By {{the middle}} of the 6th century, some Brythonic people in the {{lowlands}} of Britain had moved across the sea to form Brittany, and some had moved west, but the majority were abandoning their past language and culture and adopting the new culture of the Anglo-Saxons. As they adopted this language and culture, the barriers began to dissolve between peoples, who had earlier lived parallel lives. The archaeological evidence shows considerable continuity in the system of landscape and local governance, which was inherited from the indigenous community. There is evidence for a fusion of culture in this early period. Brythonic names appear in the lists of Anglo-Saxon elite. The Wessex royal line was traditionally founded by a man named Cerdic, an undoubtedly Celtic name ultimately derived from Caratacus. This may indicate that Cerdic was a native Briton, and that his dynasty became anglicised over time. A number of Cerdic's alleged descendants also possessed Celtic names, including the 'Bretwalda' Ceawlin. The last <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> dynasty to have a Brythonic name was King Caedwalla, who died as late as 689.|$|E

25|$|Lawrence {{was also}} a {{headquarters}} for a band of Redlegs that had initiated a particularly vicious jayhawking campaign in late March 1863. The purported objective of this group was to eliminate civilian support for the Confederate guerillas, but their tactics (executions, arson, and plundering) were employed rather indiscriminately. As one observer noted (apparently {{a member of the}} Fifth Kansas Cavalry), “I believe the Red Legs will kill any <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> country for a good horse; and they have glorified themselves considerably over finishing some unarmed sympathizers.” In describing the activities of the Redlegs, Union General Blunt stated, “A reign of terror was inaugurated, and no man’s property was safe, nor was his life worth much if he opposed them in their schemes of plunder and robbery.” It is difficult to quantify the number of civilians killed by the Redlegs, but a letter written from the Lexington area early in the Redlegs campaign (April 1863) stated that the Redlegs had “killed at least fifty men, who were unarmed and heretofore lived in peace and quiet".|$|E
500|$|The Fifth Elegy {{is largely}} {{inspired}} by Pablo Picasso's 1905 Rose Period painting, Les Saltimbanques ("The Acrobats", {{also known as}} [...] "The Family of Saltimbanques") in which Picasso depicts six figures pictured [...] "in {{the middle of a}} desert landscape and it is impossible to say whether they are arriving or departing, beginning or ending their performance." [...] Rilke depicted the six artists about to begin their performance, and that they were used as a symbol of [...] "human activity... always travelling and with no fixed abode, they are even a shade more fleeting than the rest of us, whose fleetingness was lamented." [...] Further, Rilke in the poem described these figures as standing on a [...] "threadbare carpet" [...] to suggest [...] "the ultimate loneliness and isolation of <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> incomprehensible world, practicing their profession from childhood to death as playthings of an unknown will... before their 'pure too-little' had passed into 'empty too-much.'" ...|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the debacle of the Jameson Raid in the winter of 1895–1896, the {{imperial}} government determined by order in council to appoint a permanent Resident Commissioner to supervise the affairs of the British South Africa Company in Southern Rhodesia. Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary of State for the Colonies, offered the role to Clarke, whose impressive prior administrative career was an indication of the importance being placed on the role. Graham Bower, the imperial secretary, wrote recommending him for the role: [...] "Clarke is far and away the best <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> country". Clarke was in post from 1898 to 1905, reporting directly to Alfred Milner, the High Commissioner for Southern Africa based in Johannesburg, who in turn reported to the Colonial Office in London. His role was to safeguard the interests of the natives and to call on the High Commissioner for interference where he saw fit. The Aborigines Protection Society in London approved of his appointment, stating in its annual report of 1900 that he had a [...] "rare capacity for dealing justly with native communities".|$|E

500|$|Brown became wealthy {{through his}} {{pastoral}} interests, {{and by the}} 1860s had expanded his holdings to [...] He died in February 1890, and three years later Simpson Newland published his novel, Paving the Way, a Romance of the Australian Bush. It contained a fictionalisation of actual events on the frontier. One of the stories {{in the book is}} that of Roland Grantley, a pastoral property owner, and his overseer [...] "Darkie", also a white <b>man.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> account, Grantley and Darkie shoot a group of Aboriginal people in response to attacks on shepherds and the killing of stock. The story says that 10–12 Aboriginal people were killed in the massacre, and many more wounded. The bodies are burnt. The police investigate, and Darkie, not wanting to implicate his employer, flees the district on Grantley's prize horse, using his bush skills to elude his pursuers. He swims the horse across the mouth of the Murray River, then finds passage on a whaling ship off Kangaroo Island. This account, while using fictional names, essentially retold basic known facts of the case against Brown.|$|E
500|$|When {{casting the}} actors {{for the two}} main parts, Carter had {{difficulties}} finding an actor for Scully. When he cast Gillian Anderson for the part, the network wanted to replace her. Carter believed they responded negatively towards the casting because [...] "she didn't have the obvious qualities that network executives have come to associate with hit shows". Calling her a [...] "terrific actress", Carter reacted overall positively towards Anderson's audition saying [...] "she came in and read the part with a seriousness and intensity that I knew the Scully character had to have and I knew [...] she was the right person for the part". David Duchovny on the other hand, was met with more positive response from the network, Carter even saying he was an [...] "early favorite". William B. Davis, who made his first appearance as the recurring villain The Smoking <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> episode, had originally auditioned for a larger part in the episode, saying [...] "I auditioned for the senior FBI agent who had three lines. I didn't get that part—I got the part with no lines".|$|E

In previous games, the player generally took on the role of the hero Mega <b>Man.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> game, the player can choose to start the game as either Mega Man or Bass. However, whichever character is picked must be used for the rest of the game and cannot be changed. Mega Man is able to charge his shots to make them more powerful and has the ability to slide along the ground. Bass is able to rapidly fire his arm cannon in eight directions, though shots cannot be fired while moving or pass through walls unless a certain upgrade is obtained. Bass is also able to double-jump (jump a second time in mid-air) and dash along the ground. Performing both simultaneously lets him cross great distances by doing a dash-jump.|$|E
