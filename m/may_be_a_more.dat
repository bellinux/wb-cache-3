25|$|P mitrale is broad, notched P {{waves in}} several or many leads with a {{prominent}} late negative component to the P wave in lead V1, {{and may be}} seen in MI, but also in mitral stenosis, and, potentially, any cause of overload of the left atrium.

25|$|Only 41% {{of women}} with {{cervical}} cancer {{in the developing world}} get medical treatment. Therefore, prevention of HPV by vaccination <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> effective way of lowering the disease burden in developing countries than cervical screening. The European Society of Gynecological Oncology sees the developing world as most likely to benefit from HPV vaccination. However, individuals in many resource-limited nations, Kenya for example, are unable to afford the vaccine.|$|E
25|$|A 2012 {{study found}} that 2% of a sample of 2,560 adult {{participants}} reported a change of sexual orientation identity after a 10-year period. For men, a change occurred in 0.78% {{of those who had}} identified as heterosexual, 9.52% of homosexuals, and 47% of bisexuals. For women, a change occurred in 1.36% of heterosexuals, 63.6% of lesbians, and 64.7% of bisexuals. The researchers suggested that heterosexuality <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> stable identity because of its normative status.|$|E

25|$|Explanations for {{the delayed}} {{presentation}} {{among women in}} Ghana have been traced to the cost of, and access to, and routine screening mammography. Furthermore, women with breast cancer in Ghana describe a feeling of hopelessness and helplessness, largely due to their belief in fatalism, which contributes to denial {{as a means of}} coping. Mayo et al. (2003) conclude, however, that lack of awareness <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> critical variable than fatalism in explaining health care decisions among women in Ghana.|$|E
25|$|The {{image to}} the right shows a simple {{sequential}} game that illustrates the issue with subgame imperfect Nash equilibria. In this game player one chooses left(L) or right(R), which is followed by player two being called upon to be kind (K) or unkind (U) to player one, However, player two only stands to gain from being unkind if player one goes left. If player one goes right the rational player two would de facto be kind to him in that subgame. However, The non-credible threat of being unkind at 2(2) is still part of the blue (L, (U,U)) Nash equilibrium. Therefore, if rational behavior can be expected by both parties the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> meaningful solution concept when such dynamic inconsistencies arise.|$|E
25|$|Any object {{containing}} pointed {{metal can}} create an electric arc (sparks) when microwaved. This includes cutlery, crumpled aluminium foil (though some foil used in microwaves are safe, see below), twist-ties containing metal wire, the metal wire carry-handles in paper Chinese take-out food containers, or almost any metal formed into a poorly conductive foil or thin wire; or into a pointed shape. Forks {{are a good}} example: the tines of the fork respond to the electric field by producing high concentrations of electric charge at the tips. This {{has the effect of}} exceeding the dielectric breakdown of air, about 3 megavolts per meter (3×106 V/m). The air forms a conductive plasma, which is visible as a spark. The plasma and the tines may then form a conductive loop, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> effective antenna, resulting in a longer lived spark. When dielectric breakdown occurs in air, some ozone and nitrogen oxides are formed, both of which are unhealthy in large quantities.|$|E

25|$|Carnot's theorem is {{a formal}} {{statement}} of this fact: No engine operating between two heat reservoirs {{can be more}} efficient than a Carnot engine operating between those same reservoirs. Thus, Equation 3 (what's equation 3-a confused reader) gives the maximum efficiency possible for any engine using the corresponding temperatures. A corollary to Carnot's theorem states that: All reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient. Rearranging {{the right side of}} the equation gives what <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> easily understood form of the equation. Namely that the theoretical maximum efficiency of a heat engine equals the difference in temperature between the hot and cold reservoir divided by the absolute temperature of the hot reservoir. Looking at this formula an interesting fact becomes apparent; Lowering the temperature of the cold reservoir will have more effect on the ceiling efficiency of a heat engine than raising the temperature of the hot reservoir by the same amount. In the real world, this may be difficult to achieve since the cold reservoir is often an existing ambient temperature.|$|E
25|$|Administration {{through the}} {{gastrointestinal}} tract is sometimes termed enteral or enteric administration (literally meaning 'through the intestines'). Enteral/enteric administration usually includes oral (through the mouth) and rectal (into the rectum) administration, {{in the sense}} that these are taken up by the intestines. However, uptake of drugs administered orally may also occur already in the stomach, and as such gastrointestinal (along the gastrointestinal tract) <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> fitting term for this route of administration. Furthermore, some application locations often classified as enteral, such as sublingual (under the tongue) and sublabial or buccal (between the cheek and gums/gingiva), are taken up in the proximal part of the gastrointestinal tract without reaching the intestines. Strictly enteral administration (directly into the intestines) can be used for systemic administration, as well as local (sometimes termed topical), such as in a contrast enema, whereby contrast media is infused into the intestines for imaging. However, for the purposes of classification based on location of effects, the term enteral is reserved for substances with systemic effects.|$|E
500|$|The {{fragment}} {{was discovered}} in 2000 {{with the use of}} a metal detector during a minor excavation of Gevninge (...) , a Viking Age settlement to the west of Roskilde; the contemporary royal capital of Lejre, nearby, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> likely location for the eyepiece's fabrication. Discovered in the topsoil, the fragment may originally have been lost or discarded, or buried as part of an entire helmet later destroyed by ploughing. It may alternatively represent a singular deposition, as perhaps does a helmet eyebrow discovered in Uppåkra, Sweden. If buried alone the fragment possibly served as an allusion to the one-eyed god Odin, who is said to have sacrificed an eye in exchange for wisdom and intelligence.|$|E

2500|$|The {{properties}} of a galaxy {{can also be}} determined by analyzing the stars found within them. [...] NGC 4550, a galaxy in the Virgo Cluster, has {{a large portion of}} its stars rotating in the opposite direction as the other portion. It is believed that the galaxy is the combination of two smaller galaxies that were rotating in opposite directions to each other. Bright stars in galaxies can also help determine the distance to a galaxy, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> accurate method than parallax or standard candles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{existence}} of such techniques may reduce {{the political and social}} impetus to reduce carbon emissions. [...] This has generally been called a potential moral hazard, although risk compensation <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> accurate term. This concern causes many environmental groups and campaigners to be reluctant to advocate or discuss climate engineering for fear of reducing the imperative to cut greenhouse gas emissions. However, several public opinion surveys and focus groups have found evidence of either assertions of a desire to increase emission cuts in the face of climate engineering, or of no effect. Other modelling work suggests that the threat of climate engineering may in fact increase the likelihood of emissions reduction.|$|E
2500|$|The ‘argument from hallucination’ has {{traditionally}} {{been one of those}} used by proponents of the philosophical theory of representationalism against direct realism.

[...] That representation <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> or less accurate one depending on our circumstances, the state of our health, and so on. [...] Direct realism, on the other hand, holds that the common sense or unthinking view of perception is correct, and that when perceiving the world we should be regarded as in direct contact with it, unmediated by any representation in consciousness.|$|E
