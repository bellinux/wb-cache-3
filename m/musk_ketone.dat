Earlier studies have reported the occurrence of synthetic musks in environmental and wildlife samples collected in the United States. In this study, human breast milk samples collected from Massachusetts, were analyzed for the determination of concentrations of synthetic musks such as musk xylene (1 -tert-butyl- 3, 5 -dimethyl- 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzene), <b>musk</b> <b>ketone</b> (4 -tert-butyl- 2, 6 -dimethyl- 3, 5 -dinitroacetophenone), HHCB (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -hexahydro- 4, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8 -hexamethylcyclopenta[gamma]- 2 -benzopyran), AHTN (7 -acetyl- 1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 6 -hexamethyl- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydronaphthalene), and HHCB-lactone, the oxidation product of HHCB. In addition, we estimated the daily intake of synthetic musks by infants based on the ingestion rate of breast milk. Synthetic musks were found {{in most of the}} samples analyzed, and the concentrations ranged from 3 ̆c 2 to 150 ng musk xylene/g, 3 ̆c 2 to 238 ng musk ketone/ g, 3 ̆c 5 to 917 ng HHCB/g, 3 ̆c 5 to 144 ng AHTN/g, and 3 ̆c 10 to 88. 0 ng HHCB-lactone/g, on a lipid weight basis. The concentrations of HHCB were higher than the concentrations of other synthetic musks in breast milk samples. The mean concentration of HHCB (220 ng/g, lipid weight) was 5 times greater than the concentrations reported 10 years ago for breast milk samples collected in Germany and Denmark. Maternal age was not correlated with the concentrations of musk xylene, <b>musk</b> <b>ketone,</b> HHCB, or AHTN. There was a trend of decreasing concentrations of musk xylene, <b>musk</b> <b>ketone,</b> HHCB, and AHTN, with the number of children previously breast-fed, although the correlation was not significant. Based on average daily ingestion rate of breast milk, an infant is estimated to ingest 297 +/- 229 ng musk xylene, 780 +/- 805 ng <b>musk</b> <b>ketone,</b> 1830 +/- 1170 ng HHCB, 565 +/- 614 ng AHTN, and 649 +/- 598 ng HHCB-lactone per day. The ingestion rate of synthetic musks by infants in the United States is lower than that estimated for persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).

Good analytical performances were obtained for all the target compounds. For the validation of the method, internal calibration (IC) and internal calibration with QuEChERS (ICQ) were compared. Good linearity was obtained for both calibration methods with determination coefficients (R 2) ranging between 0. 990 for Musk Xylene (MX) and 0. 999 for Tonalide (AHTN) with IC and between 0. 991 for <b>Musk</b> <b>Ketone</b> (MK) and 0. 999 for Traseolide (ATII) with ICQ. The repeatability ranges were 0. 1 %– 1. 9 % with the IC and 0. 1 %– 2. 6 % with the ICQ. The apparent recoveries obtained for SMs in the standard reference sediment (SRM 1944) varied {{in the range of}} 70 %– 98 % and 75 %– 103 % in the sediment from the Bizerte Lagoon (Tunisia). The absolute recoveries ranged between 61 % and 92 % for the SRM 1944 and between 61 % and 89 % in the sediment from the Bizerte Lagoon.

To investigate the developmental toxicity of these compounds to amphibians and fish, early lifestages of xenopus (Xenopus lae 6 is) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to three nitromusks for 96 h to examine the developmental effects of these compounds in the two species. Nitromusk body concentration measurements were carried out in parallel for correlation with potential developmen-tal effects. No increased mortality, malformation or growth inhibition was observed in either species following 96 -h exposure to 400 mg:l MX, MK and MM. However, an approximately 20 % reduced viability was observed in xenopus larvae when exposed to 400 mg:l MX, MK and MM for 11 days. Xenopus and zebrafish exposed to 10, 153, 871 and 1637 mg:l 14 C-MX for 96 h resulted in whole-body concentrations of 0. 790. 1, 11. 191. 1, 38. 791. 9 and 76. 3918. 3 mg:g, and 4. 390. 6, 73. 3911. 8, 440. 0972. 7 and 664. 0947. 7 mg:g wet body weight, respectively.

This study examines the presence of eight synthetic musk fragrances [7 -acetyl- 1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 6 -hexamethyl- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydronaphthalene (AHTN), 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -hexahydro- 4, 6, 6, 7, 8 -hexamethylcyclopenta- - 2 -benzopyran (HHCB), 5 -acetyl- 1, 1, 2, 6 -tetramethyl- 3 -iso-propylindane (ATII), 4 -acetyl- 1, 1 -dimethyl- 6 -tert-butylindane (ADBI), 6 -acetyl- 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5 - hexamethylindane (AHMI), 6, 7 -dihydro- 1, 1, 2, 3, 3,-pentamethyl- 4 -(5 H) -indanone (DPMI), 1 -tert-butyl- 3, 5 -dimethyl- 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzene (musk xylene), and 4 -tert-butyl- 3, 5 -dinitro- 2, 6 -dimethylacetophenone (<b>musk</b> <b>ketone)</b> ] in source water {{and the removal of}} these compounds as they flow through a Midwestern conventional drinking water plant with lime softening. The compounds were measured in water, waste sludge, and air throughout the plant. HHCB and AHTN were detected in 100 % of the samples and at the highest concentrations. A mass balance on HHCB and AHTN was performed under warm and cold weather conditions. The total removal efficiency for HHCB and AHTN, which averaged between 67 - 89 %, is dominated by adsorption to water softener sludge and its consequent removal by sludge wasting and media filtration. Volatilization, chlorine disinfection, and the disposal of backwash water play a minor role in the removal of both compounds. As a result of inefficient overall removal, HHCB and AHTN are a constant presence at low levels in finished drinking water. 2009 ASCE...|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of {{chemicals}} can contaminate aquatic environments and therefore be exposed to fish and amphibians during their sensitive stages of development. This raises the need for robust methods to identify chemicals that disturb the developmental process. In this thesis, methods for toxicity testing and biomonitoring were developed for zebrafish (Danio rerio) and West-African clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis). Using these methods, two groups of substances that have achieved attention during recent years were tested, synthetic musks and brominated flame retardants, as well as substances with known mechanism of action. Moreover, zebrafish embryos were used to evaluate chemically complex extracts prepared of effluent water from oil/gas production platforms. Exposure {{was performed on the}} embryo stages, to reveal embryo toxic endpoints and in connection to the metamorphosis process in frogs, to evaluate disturbances of the thyroid hormone system. Both methods were able to detect adverse effects in exposed animals. The studies showed that some musk substances had toxic effects on embryos in environmentally relevant concentrations. Embryo toxic responses of <b>musk</b> <b>ketone</b> (MK) and tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA) were recorded in zebrafish as well as in Xenopus tropicalis and moor frog (Rana arvalis) at comparable concentrations. Zebrafish embryos were adequate for monitoring the toxic impact of effluent water from oil/gas production platforms. Effects on X. tropicalis tadpoles due to exposure to propylthiouracil were reduced development and decreased hind limb length, which can be explained by thyroid disruption. Increased sensitivity of the method was achieved by measurements on histological preparations of the thyroid glands. Exposure to polybrominated diphenylethers resulted in signs of thyroid disrupting properties of one tested congener, BDE- 99. Moreover, distribution of BDE- 99 in tadpole and juvenile X. tropicalis showed long-term retention and accumulation in adipose tissue...|$|E
40|$|Musk {{compounds}} {{are widely}} spread environmental pollutants. Musk compounds {{were found in}} aquatic organisms from the North Sea, in rivers, lakes and estuaries in Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Japan, Norway, Switzerland, Sweden, and The Netherlands. Two nitro musks, musk xylene (MX) and <b>musk</b> <b>ketone</b> (MK), and two polycyclic musks (HHCB and AHTN) were the major musk compounds determined and observed in freshwater {{as well as in}} marine organisms. The main source of nitro and polycyclic musk residues in aquatic organisms are effluents from sewage treatment plants (STPs). The presence of synthetic musk compounds in biota can, therefore, be used as an indicator of the exposure of biota to STP effluents. Synthetic musk compounds have mainly been determined in fish, but some data are also available for mussels and shrimps. In addition, MX was found in eggs of coastal bird species, and HHCB and AHTN were identified in otters. The concentrations of HHCB and AHTN in freshwater organisms from Europe are one to two orders of magnitude higher than MX and MK, and comparable to levels of PCBs in fish. Indications were found that several fish species such as eel (Anguila anguila) could metabolise HHCB and AHTN, and that food chain transfer of these musk compounds from prey fish (e. g. roach) to carnivore fish (pike-perch) occurs. Time trend data for MX and MK in eel from the river Elbe (Germany) showed that for some locations a decline in the concentrations from 1994 to 1999 occurred, probably due to the restriction of the use of MX in Germany since 1993. Similar results were observed for MX in eel from the river Rhine. Nitro musks and polycyclic musks were found in fish samples (e. g. trout, herring, mussels, tuna and mackerel) collected at food markets. In some samples (trout and shrimp) the concentrations of MX and MK were similar to the concentrations of PCBs, while in other samples (e. g. halibut and mussels) the concentrations of MX and MK are one to two orders of magnitude lower than those of PCBs. In general, the highest concentrations of MX were found in trout, and in some tuna samples rather high concentrations of MK were foun...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of pharmaceuticals {{in the environment}} has been an issue of increasing concern and sewage treatment plants {{have been identified as}} the principal sources of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting chemicals in the aquatic environment. In this study, zebrafish juveniles and adults were exposed to sewage effluents that had undergone treatment processes (A 1 -A 7) at Hammarby Sjostad’s sewage treatment plant in order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the treatment processes. This was conducted with the aid of the fish embryotoxicity test (FET), reproduction test and the fish sexual development test (FSDT). A reduction in the spawning ability and fecundity (number of eggs produced by the females) was observed in the reproduction test in sewage effluent A 4 (Biofilter). The zebrafish exposed to sewage effluent A 2 (after sedimentation treatment) had a higher number of successful spawnings than the controls, while the fish exposed to effluents A 3 (Outlet L 1) and A 5 (ozone) exhibited a decrease in spawning ability. The induction of vitellogenin was detected in male zebrafish exposed to A 2 (after sedimentation treatment), A 3 (Outlet L 1) and A 4 (Biofilter) treatment processes in the fish sexual development test(FSDT). In the FET conducted on the offsprings of the adult zebrafish exposed to the various sewage effluents, no effect was observed. In addition, eight pharmaceuticals from different therapeutic classes viz Clozapine (anti psychotic), Atenolol (β-blocker), Cimetidine (anti histamine), Fluoxetine (anti depressant), Loperamide (anti diarrhoeal), Verapamil (Calcium channel blocker), Bezafibrate (lipid lowering agent) and Cyclophosphamide (anti neoplastic) were evaluated for their potential toxicity to zebrafish embryos with the aid of the fish embryotoxicity test. The zebrafish embryos were exposed to five different concentrations of the pharmaceuticals in 96 well plates. The exposure concentrations were 1 μg/L, 10 μg/L, 100 μg/L, 1 mg/L and 10 mg/L. Dimethyl sulphoxide(DMSO) and standardized fish water were used as controls. A concentration of 0. 1 % DMSO was maintained in the test solutions. A mixture of <b>musk</b> <b>ketone</b> and phenylthiourea was used as positive control. The endpoints monitored included hatching time, heart rate, tail extension, circulation, coagulation, spinal deformation, death and oedema. A decrease in the heart rate was observed in the zebrafish embryos exposed to the highest concentration of clozapine (10 mg/L) and abnormalities were observed in the embryos exposed to all the concentrations of clozapine. The results of this investigation indicate that the FET could be improved upon in order to render it more sensitive for the toxicity testing of substances. Also, ozonation appears to be an effective treatment technique in sewage treatment plants for the reduction of sewage effluents and pharmaceuticals...|$|E
40|$|This {{work was}} focused on the {{determination}} of musk compounds in various components of the environment. Synthetic musk compounds are organic substances commonly used as fragrant constituents of detergents, perfumes, cosmetics and other personal care products (PCPs). These compounds contaminate the aquatic environment through municipal wastewater from sewage treatment plants. The result is accumulation of these analytes in the environment and their occurrence in food chain. Synthetic fragrances are commonly detected also in human body; these substances generally belong among relatively new persistent organic pollutants (POPs) because of their persistence, bioaccumulation, and potential toxicity. The aim of this work was to optimize the methods for the determination of selected synthetic fragrances in wastewater (municipal, industrial) and in fish muscle. These analytes were determined in wastewater [the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) Brno – Modřice, cosmetic manufacturing plant] and in fish Squalius cephalus that had been caught in the river Svratka. The selected analytes (14 substances) originate from the group of nitromusk, polycyclic musk and linear musk compounds. Solid phase microextraction (SPME) [for wastewater samples] and pressurized solvent extraction (PSE) [for fish samples] were used for isolation of analytes from real samples. The identification and quantification of analytes were carried out by high resolution gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry detection (GC-MS). The results show that galaxolide (g. L- 1) and tonalide (tenths of g. L- 1) were polycyclic musk compounds which were found at the highest concentration level in influent and also in effluent samples from the WWTP Brno – Modřice. The most extended nitromusk compound was <b>musk</b> <b>ketone</b> (hundredths of g. L- 1). Linear musk compounds were detected in all influent samples (g. L- 1). The overall removal efficiency of synthetic musk compounds from wastewater in the WWTP varies within the following ranges: nitromusk compounds 34. 4 % – 85. 4 %, polycyclic musk compounds 36. 7 % – 53. 3 % and linear musk compounds 90. 5 % – 99. 9 %. On the basis of the results it can be stated that wastewater (effluent from the WWTP) is the primary source of musk compounds, especially of the polycyclic ones in the environment. It has been also shown that ultrafiltration used in a cosmetic plant is a highly efficient technology for removing nitromusk and polycyclic musk compounds from industry wastewater. The results from evaluation of the fish contamination by musk compounds show that galaxolide was the substance which reached the highest concentration levels (tens of g. kg- 1 l. w.). The results corroborate ubiquitous occurrence of musk compounds in the environment and reduction of using of nitromusk compounds due to their potential toxic properties. It has been shown that the insufficiency of the purifying procedures used in the WWTP Brno – Modřice has a significant influence on the concentration level of polycyclic musk compounds (tonalide, galaxolide) in fish caught from the river Svratka...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic musks have a {{widespread}} {{use as a}} substitute for natural musks in fragrances, and {{can be found in a}} number of consumer products such as laundry detergents, cleaning agents and cosmetic products (soaps, perfumes etc.). The most frequently used synthetic musks belong to the nitro musks (e. g. musk xylene (MX) and <b>musk</b> <b>ketone</b> (MK)) and to the polycyclic musks (e. g. HHCB, AHTN, ADBI, ATII, AHDI) (Figure 1). Because of their high lipofility and chemical stability, musk compounds can be expected to accumulate in the human body, and it is important to investigate their occurrence in human milk. For risk assessment purposes, the Swedish NFA (National Food Administration) has made recurrent measurements of levels of selected persistent organic pollutants (POP) (e. g. polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, persistent pesticides and flame retardants) in human breast milk. The ambition is to follow changes in the levels of these environmental contaminants in human breast milk and to establish a time trend. The aim is also to evaluate possible health risks for the mother and in particular for the breastfed infant. The first sampling of breast milk performed by the NFA occurred in Uppsala County in 1996 - 1999. About 300 primiparae participated in this large study that to some parts was financially supported by the Swedish EPA (Environmental Protection Agency). The second sampling was performed in Uppsala in 2000 - 2001 (n= 31) and the third sampling in Uppsala in 2002 - 2003 (n= 31). A new sampling (2004 - 2005) is in progress. The investigations in 2000 - 2001, 2002 - 2003 and 2004 - 2005 have partly been financed by the Swedish EPA. Earlier (in 1999 - 2000 and 2002), 44 randomly selected breast milk samples from the monitoring of environmental contaminants have been analysed for synthetic musk compounds. The results presented in Eriksson et al. (2003) indicated that the levels of HHCB, AHTN and MX decreased from 1998 to 2001. The investigation also pointed to the possibility of a relationship between perfume exposure from cosmetics and detergents, and musk levels in breast milk. During 2003, 80 additional breast milk samples have been analysed for synthetic musk compounds. In this report results from the earlier (2002) and the latest (2003) analyses of nitro musks (MX, MK) and polycyclic musks (HHCB, AHTN, ADBI, ATII, AHDI) are presented. Results from the analysis in 1999 - 2000 have been excluded since the later analyses are of better quality. The total number of samples analysed in 2002 and 2003 is 101. The possible time trend and the possible relationship with use of perfumed products are investigated as well as relationships between musk levels and lifestyle factors such as age and body mass index (BMI). The analyses of musk compounds in breast milk and the compilation of data was financed by the Swedish EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) ...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 61 - 76). Los Laureles - Goat Canyon is a subwatershed {{located within}} the Tijuana River Watershed is presented. This canyon measures 1191 hectares (4. 6 square miles), of which 90 percent is in Mexico, and the remainder {{is part of the}} Tijuana River National Estuary Research Reserve(TRNERR) in the U. S. In this canyon, as in most of the Mexican border region, the rapid human population growth has led to an unorganized urbanization established with squatter housing structures that lack potable water, sewage system, paved roads, and appropriate waste management. As a consequence, several opened solid waste dumpsites have been observed in the Mexican side of the canyon. These open dumpsites along with the lack of other public services are considered to contribute environmental contaminants that may affect human health and wildlife in the TRNERR. The objectives of this study were to (i) determine the presence and concentration of heavy metals in soil samples collected from Los Laureles/Goat Canyon, (ii) examine soil samples from Los Laureles/Goat Canyon using a non-targeted analysis to screen for the presence of organic pollutants including POPs, (iii) identify the possible sources of the soil contaminants in the canyon, (iv) obtain baseline data for future comparison with studies conducted on other contaminated soils, and (v) create a baseline data of the soil contaminants on the canyon that can be utilized in future research. This study utilized the X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry to screen for heavy metals in 24 composite soil samples. A comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC??GC/ToF-MS) was used to screen for the presence of organic contaminants using a non-targeted analysis 9 composite soil samples. As results, 16 metals were detected, but only arsenic and cadmium were found to be above the EPA recommended levels (apply for cleaned Superfund sites). The soil concentrations of Cd found in this study are similar to previous studies done on the TRNERR, indicating. that the metal concentrations in this area havenot changed since the year 1997. With respect to the organic pollutants, this study identified 168 organic compounds, but there was only some scientific literature information for the only 30 compounds. Some organic contaminants such as benzothiazole (BT) and its derivative compounds seem to originate from rubber materials of the tires disposed at this canyon. Few pesticide related compounds such as hydroxylated biphenyl and benzyl benzoate were also found. Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), compound known by the state of California to have carcinogenic characteristics, and several phenolic compounds used as antioxidants were also detected in the screened soil samples. In addition, organic compounds that have may have endocrine disruptor characteristics such as octylphenols, galaxolide, <b>musk</b> <b>ketone,</b> bisphenol A (BPA), and triclosan (TCS), which are commonly used in household products were also detected in this study. Nonetheless, the origin of the majority of these compounds is unknown because they can come {{from a wide range of}} sources. For example, the several alkylated benzenes and PAHs found in this study might come from combustion or various forms of fuel. Only the parent PAHs, alkylated/partially saturated PAHs (semi-quantified), BPA, and TCS were quantified for this study. The PAHs concentrations were similar or lower than background concentrations around the world's soil, but the average concentration levels of BPA (209 ppb) and TCS (280 ppb) found in this canyon are noteworthy because they are higher or comparable to concentrations found in sewage sludge and soils amended with sewage sludge. This suggests that these contaminants may come from sewage due to the fact that the residents in this canyon lack a sewage system or a water treatment plant. Therefore, the concentration and verification of some of the organic compounds needs to be done, and further research measuring the concentrations and ecological effects of BPA, TCS, and other compounds related to municipal sewage in this canyon should be conducted...|$|E
