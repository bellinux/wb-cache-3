5|$|After {{an armored}} car leaves a bank with ten million dollars, it is {{attacked}} en route by Diabolik who manages {{to steal the}} money and escape with his partner Eva Kant. Leaving the <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> underground hideout, Diabolik and Eva attend a press conference held by the Minister of the Interior which they disrupt by releasing laughing gas. Due to {{the high level of}} crime, the death penalty is brought back. The police cannot find Diabolik, and gang leader Valmont suffers at their hands from a clampdown because of his actions. Realising things can only get worse because of Diabolik's crime spree, Valmont contacts Inspector Ginko and makes a deal to catch him for the police. At his hideout, Diabolik decides to steal the famous Aksand emerald necklace from the Saint Just Castle for Eva's birthday. Valmont builds up an identikit picture of Eva and circulates it as a means of capturing Diabolik. Diabolik scales the walls of Saint Just Castle where he finds the police lying in wait. He manages to steal the necklace by fooling the police officers with mirrors on the road and dummy decoys of himself.|$|E
25|$|Two prosperous brewers from Kingston, John and Thomas Tiffin, left <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> wills in 1638 for the {{education}} of local people. At first the money was used for scholarships to attend local schools. However, the fund grew through investment returns and additional donations, so by the 1820s nearly 110 children were benefiting from the fund.|$|E
25|$|The dhakis {{routinely}} brave police harassment {{to reach}} the capital with their large dhaks. With terrorism in the air, the harassment has increased. Even after checking with metal detectors for guns and bombs, the police do {{not allow them to}} go unless they pay. The return journey is more hazardous because they have <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> pockets.|$|E

25|$|An {{extension}} of Novardok's unconventional approach entailed {{the establishment of}} numerous branches of the yeshiva. The most elite students of the yeshiva would set out on foot to strange communities without <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> pockets, simultaneously abstaining from speech and not asking for a ride or even food. Upon reaching a town, they would enter the Beth Midrash, and without a word to anyone, study Torah.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{investors have}} {{doubts about the}} {{possibilities}} of policy makers to quickly contain the crisis. Since countries that use the euro as their currency have fewer monetary policy choices (e.g., they cannot print <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> own currencies to pay debt holders), certain solutions require multi-national cooperation. Further, the European Central Bank has an inflation control mandate but not an employment mandate, {{as opposed to the}} U.S. Federal Reserve, which has a dual mandate.|$|E
25|$|The Indian Cricket League (ICL) {{was founded}} in 2007, with funding {{provided}} by Zee Entertainment Enterprises. The ICL was not recognised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) or the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the BCCI were not pleased with its committee members joining the ICL executive board. To prevent players from joining the ICL, the BCCI increased the prize <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> own domestic tournaments and also imposed lifetime bans on players joining the ICL, which was considered a rebel league by the board.|$|E

50|$|Debt is a {{major source}} of <b>money</b> {{creation}} <b>in</b> modern economies. Some economists, especially the Austrian school, believe that fractional reserve banking should not be allowed and banks {{should not be allowed to}} lend <b>money</b> deposited <b>in</b> <b>their</b> accounts by individuals, unless they approve. Money creation should either be banned (Austrian school) or be a government privilege.|$|R

25|$|In late January Sir Brian Pitman {{became the}} Chairman of Virgin Money; Pitman had {{previously}} been an advisor to Virgin during the attempted buyout of Northern Rock in 2007. In February Pitman stated {{that the company was}} interested in acquiring some branches of other banks which lie in good locations; branches belonging to RBS and Lloyds were reported as possible candidates. Following Pitman's death Sir David Clementi was appointed Chairman. In April 2010, WL Ross & Co. LLC invested £100 million in Virgin Money for a 21% stake in the company. WL Ross had previously supported Virgin <b>Money</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> previous bid for Northern Rock. James Lockhart, Vice Chairman of WL Ross, joined the Virgin Money board.|$|E
25|$|In many cases, borrowers write a post-dated check (check with {{a future}} date) to the lender; if the borrowers don't have enough <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> account by the check's date, their check will bounce. In Texas, payday lenders are {{prohibited}} from suing a borrower for theft if the check is post-dated. One payday lender in the state instead gets their customers to write checks dated for the day the loan is given. Customers borrow money because they don't have any, so the lender accepts the check knowing that it would bounce on the check's date. If the borrower fails to pay on the due date, the lender sues the borrower for writing a hot check.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the slums}} in today's world are {{a product of}} {{urbanization}} brought by colonialism. For instance, the Europeans arrived in Kenya {{in the nineteenth century}} and created urban centers such as Nairobi mainly to serve their financial interests. They regarded the Africans as temporary migrants and needed them only for supply of labor. The housing policy aiming to accommodate these workers was not well enforced and the government built settlements in the form of single-occupancy bedspaces. Due to the cost of time and <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> movement back and forth between rural and urban areas, their families gradually migrated to the urban centre. As they could not afford to buy houses, slums were thus formed.|$|E

They form a company that arranges for survivors to be buried <b>in</b> <b>their</b> original country but as the <b>money</b> rolls <b>in,</b> <b>their</b> good intentions are corrupted.|$|R
25|$|Because banks hold {{reserves}} in amounts {{that are less}} than the amounts of their deposit liabilities, and because the deposit liabilities are considered <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> own right, fractional-reserve banking permits the money supply to grow beyond {{the amount of the}} underlying base money originally created by the central bank. In most countries, the central bank (or other monetary authority) regulates bank credit creation, imposing reserve requirements and capital adequacy ratios. This can slow down the process of money creation that occurs in the commercial banking system, and helps to ensure that banks are solvent and have enough funds to meet demand for withdrawals. However, rather than directly controlling the money supply, central banks usually pursue an interest rate target to adjust the rate of inflation and bank issuance of credit.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Mars was a {{struggling}} singer-songwriter, and Levine was a producer looking {{to work with}} new songwriters. Lawrence was the first guest at Levine's studio (Levcon Studios); they had previously worked together after being introduced by a mutual friend. One day Mars and Lawrence {{were sitting in the}} car with no <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> pockets when they decided to try producing for themselves and enlisted the help of Levine who contributed his equipment and expertise in drum programming, sampling and other electronic sounds that dominate. In 2009, The Smeezingtons settled in Hollywood. After creating the team, [...] they worked over 10 hours every day for two years.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Easley, {{along with}} Buffalo Bills {{defensive}} end Bruce Smith, were named {{as the new}} owners of the Norfolk Nighthawks of the AF2, a semi-professional arena football league branched out from the Arena Football League. The day after the city announced Easley and Smith as owners, a controversy arose with Mark Garcea and Page Johnson, {{the owners of the}} Hampton Roads Admirals minor league hockey team, and the city of Norfolk, Virginia. Garcea and Johnson stated that they participated in the original AF2 meetings and asked the city for exclusive rights to own the franchise, providing a $5,000 down payment. Instead, the city allowed Easley and Smith to pay the league's $75,000 franchise fee. The AF2 started playing their first games in the summer of 2000. In his first season as owner, the Nighthawks averaged 6,500 fans at their home field per game, and sold 3,200 season tickets. The team made the AF2 playoffs, but lost <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> first season, which Easley blamed as [...] "rookie mistakes" [...] and startup costs. The team disbanded prior to the 2004 season.|$|E

500|$|At {{any given}} time, the four contestants who have {{accumulated}} the most <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> bouts live in [...] "Winners' Row," [...] {{an area of}} living quarters set {{up next to the}} hourglass. They are at risk of being displaced if someone else outscores them. During a [...] "Winner's Defense" [...] bout, the current [...] "Power Player" [...] chooses one of the four Winners' Row occupants (including himself/herself) to face off against the current Money Chair occupant. The winner claims the loser's entire winnings in addition to his/her own and assumes control of the Money Chair, while the loser is eliminated. In episode one, the Power Player was the contestant with the most winnings; starting with episode two, it was the contestant who had the highest number of correct answers from playing along in Winners' Row that day. Contestants who are defeated in the Winner's Defense bouts lose all winnings they have accumulated. All other defeated contestants, including those displaced from Winners' Row by being out-scored, may try out again for a chance to win their way back into the Money Chair.|$|E
500|$|When {{the ninth}} {{syndicated}} season began on September 13, 2010, the format was overhauled. Ten {{questions were asked}} in round one, each assigned one of ten different money amounts which were randomized {{at the beginning of}} the game, as were the questions themselves. The difficulty of the questions was not tied to the dollar value. The dollar values for each question remained hidden until a contestant either provided a correct answer or chose to [...] "jump" [...] the question. The value of each question answered correctly was added to the contestant's bank, for a maximum total of $68,600. A contestant who completed the round successfully could walk at any subsequent point with all the <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> bank, or could walk without completing the round with half that amount (e.g., a contestant who banked $30,000 would leave with $15,000). After completing round one, the contestant moved on to a second round of gameplay (the [...] "Classic Millionaire" [...] round), in which four non-categorized questions were played for set non-cumulative values and a correct answer augmented the contestant's winnings to that point, as in the older formats. The shuffle format changes, including the randomization and double-round distribution of questions, were reverted for the fourteenth syndicated season.|$|E

[...] At 7:30 work started in the shifts for those privileged enough to do so, punctuated by a whistle, and prisoners {{would have to go}} through a metal detector during work shifts. If assigned a job, prisoners had to accept that line of work; prisoners were not permitted to have <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> possessions but earnings went into a prisoner's Trust Fund. [...] Some of the prisoners were assigned duties with the guards and foremen in the Laundry, Tailor Shop, Cobblers Shop, Model Shop etc. and in gardening and labor. Smoking, a privilege, was permitted in the workplace providing there wasn't any hazardous condition, but inmates were not permitted to smoke between the recreation yard and work. Lunch was served at 11:20, followed by a 30-minute rest in the cell, before returning to work until 16:15. Dinner was served at 16:25 and the prisoners would then retire to their cells to be locked in for the night at 16:50, and lights went off at 21:30. After being locked in for the night, 6 guards usually patrolled the four cell blocks. Many prisoners have compared their duration at Alcatraz to hell and would have [...] preferred death to continued incarceration.|$|E

2500|$|Following the Midrash, Rashi {{read the}} steward's {{words to the}} {{brothers}} in [...] "Your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure," [...] to mean that God gave them the <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> merit, and if their merit was insufficient, the God of their father Jacob gave it {{to them in the}} merit of their father. Similarly, the 12th century Italian Rabbi Menachem ben Shlomo taught that the words [...] "your God" [...] signified that it was a reward for their fearing God, while the words [...] "the God of your fathers" [...] signified that it was a reward for Jacob's fearing God. Rashbam, however, read [...] to report that everyone knew that the brothers regularly benefitted from miracles. And David Kimhi (RaDaK) interpreted the steward to mean that if the brothers found the <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> sacks, it was a gift from heaven, comparable to if a human being had given them a treasure.|$|E
