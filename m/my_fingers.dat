500|$|The {{themes of}} the album are {{reflected}} in the album cover designed by Alexander McQueen. Björk approached McQueen explaining to him the person who wrote Homogenics songs was someone who [...] "had to become a warrior. A warrior who had to fight not with weapons, but with love.

He continued playing club cricket in the Newcastle competition for Belmont until rheumatism forced him to retire from all forms of cricket aged 55: [...] "Rheumatism in my right hand made it embarrassing for me to continue.

[...] "It was wretchedly cold all the way... and I was cold at the start. [...] My eyes suffered towards the end, and <b>my</b> <b>fingers</b> were quite numbed."

500|$|The {{greatest}} literary strengths in Tipping the Velvet, {{according to}} reviewers and literary scholars, are the vibrant {{portrayal of the}} districts and streets of London, and Waters' ability to create sympathetic and realistic characters. Her use of synaesthesia in lush descriptions particularly interested Harriet Malinowitz in The Women's Review of Books. For example, Malinowitz cites the scene when Nan first meets Kitty, removing her glove to shake Kitty's hand. Very much an oyster girl, Nan's hands are covered with [...] "those rank sea-scents, of liquor and oyster-flesh, crab-meat and whelks, which had flavoured <b>my</b> <b>fingers</b> and those of my family {{for so many years}} we had ceased, entirely, to notice them." [...] Nan is mortified that she smells like a herring, but Kitty assuages her fears, kissing her hand and telling her she instead smells like a mermaid. Malinowitz includes this and other descriptions of sights, sounds, and smells in Victorian London as examples of elements that are [...] "breathlessly and wittily detailed".|$|E
500|$|No {{one in my}} {{large family}} wrote poetry. But the first Russian woman poet, Anna Bunina, was the aunt of my {{grandfather}} Erasm Ivanovich Stogov. The Stogovs were modest landowners in the Mozhaisk region of the Moscow Province. They were moved here after the insurrection {{during the time of}} Posadnitsa Marfa. In Novgorod they had been a wealthier and more distinguished family. Khan Akhmat, my ancestor, was killed one night in his tent by a Russian killer-for-hire. Karamzin tells us that this marked the end of the Mongol yoke on Russia. [...] It was well known that this Akhmat was a descendant of Genghiz Khan. In the eighteenth century, one of the Akhmatov Princesses – Praskovia Yegorovna – married the rich and famous Simbirsk landowner Motovilov. Yegor Motovilov was my great-grandfather; his daughter, Anna Yegorovna, was my grandmother. She died when my mother was nine years old, and I was named in her honour. Several diamond rings and one emerald were made from her brooch. Though <b>my</b> <b>fingers</b> are thin, still her thimble didn't fit me.|$|E
500|$|According to Entertainment Weekly, MDNA World Tour {{shed light}} on the impact Madonna has had on the younger {{generation}} of artists, dancers, and general fans [...] "who refuse to conform for conformity's sake". Tull took the best moments from the 88different concerts of the tour, to create a cohesive documentary. He recalled that there were numerous footage available from the tour and they had to find the [...] "perfect" [...] shot for Madonna. He gave an example that the performance of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] had cuts from 50 countries alone. [...] "It was really intense. I think I looked down one day and I was like, 'Oh, <b>my</b> <b>fingers</b> are about to fall off'. But it was worth it", Tull concluded. A preview for the DVD was first shown at the Billboard Music Awards and another preview was released in June 2013, showing the singer performing [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'" [...] on the tour, the lead single from MDNA. Another video showed Madonna auditioning for the dancers, while singing an acoustic version of her 2001 single, [...] "Don't Tell Me".|$|E

After her release in 2006, she published a memoir, , and started recording what would become her second solo album, How Dirty Girls Get Clean, collaborating again with Perry and Smashing Pumpkins vocalist/guitarist Billy Corgan in the writing and recording. Love had written several songs, including an anti-cocaine song titled [...] "Loser Dust", during her time in rehab in 2005. She told Billboard: [...] "My hand-eye coordination was so bad , I didn't even know chords anymore. It was like <b>my</b> <b>fingers</b> were frozen. And I wasn't allowed to make noise ...

500|$|The young Stanford {{was given}} a {{conventional}} education at a private day school in Dublin run by Henry Tilney Bassett, who concentrated on the classics {{to the exclusion of}} other subjects. Stanford's parents encouraged the boy's precocious musical talent, employing a succession of teachers in violin, piano, organ and composition. Three of his teachers were former pupils of Ignaz Moscheles, including his godmother Elizabeth Meeke, of whom Stanford recalled, [...] "She taught me, before I was twelve years old, to read at sight. ... She made me play every day {{at the end of my}} lesson a Mazurka of Chopin: never letting me stop for a mistake. ... By the time I had played through the whole fifty-two Mazurkas, I could read most music of the calibre <b>my</b> <b>fingers</b> could tackle with comparative ease." [...] One of the young Stanford's earliest compositions, a march in D major, written when he was eight years old, was performed in the pantomime at the Theatre Royal, Dublin three years later. At the age of seven, Stanford gave a piano recital for an invited audience, playing works by Beethoven, Handel, Mendelssohn, Moscheles, Mozart and Bach. One of his songs was taken up by the University of Dublin Choral Society and was well received.|$|E
