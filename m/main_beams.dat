25|$|Shiremark Mill slowly became derelict, an {{inspection}} by Rex Wailes in 1933 {{resulted in an}} estimated repair cost of £100. The cap boarding was repaired but the mill was again left to deteriorate. In 1950, Capel Parish Council approached the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings {{and the owner of}} the mill with a view to securing the mill's preservation. The mill had been listed as an antiquity by Surrey County Council by 1951. In 1952, a detailed inspection of the mill found that the sills and lower part of the cant posts were rotten. Thompson's, the Alford millwrights estimated that the mill would cose £2,500 to restore. The <b>main</b> <b>beams</b> of the first floor were supported by brick piers, but no other work was done. Although the mill had all four sails in 1928, the sails fell off one by one, with the last falling in 1956.

40|$|High flexural-rigid {{cross beams}} {{at the joints}} of a <b>main</b> <b>beam</b> can {{function}} as restraining members to prevent rotation during lateral torsional buckling (LTB). With less flexural-rigid members, joint rotation results in a decrease of the <b>main</b> <b>beam’s</b> LTB critical moment. This paper elucidates the cross beam’s minimum flexural rigidity to prevent the <b>main</b> <b>beam’s</b> joint rotation during torsional buckling. It is assumed that material behaves elastically, the beam’s web doesn’t undergo distortions, and shear forces effects are neglected. The cross-beam’s flexural rigidity is represented by a spiral spring. Under buckling, this spring produces a torque moment, proportional to the joint rotation. The torque will disturb the <b>main</b> <b>beam’s</b> LTB equation system. By adjusting the spring constant, the joint rotation is minimized, thus reducing the torque’s disturbing effect within the equation. By neglecting this effect, the LTB equations at all fields of <b>main</b> <b>beam</b> are identical to the general buckling equations for constant moments. For n cross beams, 4 (n+ 1) integration constants are resulted. By applying the boundary conditions at beam ends and utilizing the geometry and natural boundary conditions at the joints, 4 (n+ 1) homogeneous equations for the integration constant are obtained. By conducting the trial and error method, the critical moment resulting in a zero determinant for the homogeneous equation coefficient matrix is acquired. Then, the LTB first-mode deformation shape can be drawn. The analysis shows that to achieve the critical moment, a <b>main</b> <b>beam</b> having a cross beam located at mid span needs the most optimum (smallest) flexural rigidity of cross beam than when it is in other locations (L/ 2). Observing the first-mode shape, for a certain spring constant value, the rotation at the joint will approach zero...|$|R
