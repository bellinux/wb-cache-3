5|$|By 1954, NY12 and NY28 were shifted westward onto a new bypass {{around the}} village of Remsen. NY28B was {{extended}} southward along NY12 and NY28's former alignment on Main Street and westward on Steuben Street to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> highway. The NY28B designation was eliminated in the mid-1960s and replaced with NY920V, an unsigned reference route. Around the same time, NY287 was realigned onto the bypass that now carries NY365 around the northern fringe of {{the village of}} Prospect, truncating NY920V to its current length.|$|E

By January 1944, the Air Technical Service Command refined the RfP and in January1945, the specifications were further revised in MX-472 to specify a jet-powered aircraft. Although a number of aerospace companies studied the feasibility of such aircraft, McDonnell was the only company to submit a proposal to the original 1942 request and later revised requirements. The company's Model 27 proposal was completely reworked to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> specifications.|$|E

5|$|The first {{change to}} the highway's {{alignment}} occurred on November 1, 1966, when SH-51 was straightened between Stillwater and Yale; SH-108 was realigned to continue to concur with SH-51. Around the same time, the remainder of SH-108 was paved. The final change to SH-108 was made on June 4, 1974, when a straightening of SH-33 resulted in a slight extension of SH-108 to continue to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> highway. No changes have been made since.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs' {{success was}} based on fast footwork, an ability to play many {{different}} shots, and excellent placement of the ball. Among the first batsmen to succeed against previously devastating googly bowlers, he adapted his technique to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> styles of bowling that arose early in his career; he mixed classical shots with an effective defence. He was particularly successful on difficult pitches for batting. An opening batsman, Hobbs established several effective opening partnerships; with Tom Hayward and Andy Sandham for Surrey and with Wilfred Rhodes and Herbert Sutcliffe for England. His partnership with Sutcliffe remains in 2016 the most effective for the first wicket, in terms of average partnership, in Test history. Contemporaries rated Hobbs extremely highly, and critics continue to list him among the best batsmen of all time.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, {{when the}} I-196/US 131 freeway opened, the western {{terminus}} of M-89 {{was extended to}} <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> freeway. A few years later, when M-96 was realigned onto a route that took it into Battle Creek, M-89 was extended southeasterly along Michigan Avenue (the old M-96) and terminated at M-37. The highway was extended further southeasterly into Battle Creek to replace the old routing of M-37 along Michigan Avenue; it then turned south on Washington to the BL I-94 where it terminated, thus bringing the route to its current alignment.|$|E

5|$|NY177 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It originally extended from US11 in Adams Center to NY12 west of the village of Lowville. When the portion of I-81 near Adams Center was completed in the late 1950s, NY177 was extended westward over a county-maintained highway to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> expressway at exit42. On August1, 1979, ownership and maintenance of NY177 between I-81 and US11 was transferred from Jefferson County to the state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government.|$|E
5|$|NY35 {{was split}} up into two routes {{in the early}} 1940s. The portion of old NY35 west of Ontario Center Road became NY383 while the Ontario Center Road section became part of an {{extended}} NY350. The extension created an overlap between NY350 and NY33B from Cator Corners to NY33. NY33 was truncated on its east end to downtown Rochester on January1, 1949. As a result, NY33B was redesignated as NY31F. The easternmost leg of the route still overlapped NY350; however, it now followed NY350 south to NY31 in Macedon. NY350 was extended a short distance northward in the mid-1940s to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> super two highway carrying US104 between Union Hill and Sodus.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} {{originally}} scheduled for completion in April 1945, but construction was expedited after the defeat at the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944 as the IJN {{anticipated that the}} United States would now be able to bomb Japan with long-range aircraft from bases in the Mariana Islands.

5|$|The Battle of Hulao (虎牢之戰) on 28 May 621 was {{a decisive}} {{victory for the}} Tang Dynasty prince Li Shimin, through which {{he was able to}} subdue two rival warlords, Dou Jiande and Wang Shichong. It is the major and final battle during the Luoyang-Hulao {{campaign}} between Tang, Zheng and Xia. The battle was fought at the strategically important Hulao Pass, east of Luoyang. Li Shimin led a siege on the city of Luoyang, seat of the self-declared emperor Wang Shichong, who solicited help from Dou Jiande from the east. However, Dou Jiande delayed and when he finally arrived, Li Shimin brought forces to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> threat. Li Shimin's army avoided conflict until the troops of Dou Jiande were exhausted and then led a cavalry charge, breaking the opposing army and capturing Dou Jiande. Afterwards, Wang Shichong, seeing no other choice, surrendered Luoyang, and both his and Dou Jiande's states were absorbed by the Tang. Dou Jiande was later executed, resulting in some of his followers, led by Liu Heita, raising an unsuccessful rebellion against the Tang. Hulao marked the decisive turning point in the civil wars that followed the collapse of the Sui Dynasty, after which the eventual victory of the Tang was never in doubt.|$|E

5|$|The Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) {{completed}} the freeway bypass of the Ann Arbor–Ypsilanti in 1956, then moved the M-17 designation back to Washtenaw Avenue, Michigan Avenue and Ecorse Road, removing Bus. M-17 in the process. US12 and US112 replaced the BYPUS112 designation on the freeway. The former US112 designation through downtown Ypsilanti was {{converted to a}} BUSUS112 designation, including sections concurrent with M-17. Another change was made to the Ann-Arbor section of the highway as it was truncated to end at US23. The 1962 completion of the US23 freeway through the Ann Arbor area by MSHD moved the western terminus of M-17 west to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> freeway at the current terminus. The eastern terminus was progressively scaled back starting in 1968. The US25 concurrency was removed and the terminus was moved to M-39/Southfield Road in Allen Park. A second truncation scaled the terminus back to US12, the current eastern endpoint.|$|E
5|$|The first {{alignment}} of the Route 92 Freeway, proposed in the 1950s, was to begin at an interchange with Interstate 95, known as the Somerset Freeway {{in the community of}} Skillman (in Montgomery Township). The route was supposed to head eastward, crossing an interchange with U.S. Route 206 in Montgomery Township before crossing over County Route 518 in Rocky Hill and interchanging with New Jersey Route 27 in Kingston. The route would then turn to the south and interchange with U.S. Route 1 and County Route 522 in the community of Monmouth Junction. From there, Route 92 would cross over the Pennsylvania Railroad to the north of New Jersey Route 64 in Plainsboro, turning to the southeast along the Millstone River. After crossing the Millstone, Route 92 was to interchange with County Route 535 in Cranbury before entering East Windsor, where it would interchange with U.S. Route 130. From there, the route would <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Jersey Turnpike at Interchange 8 before reaching its eastern terminus at an interchange with New Jersey Route 33 in the Twin Rivers community in East Windsor.|$|E
5|$|If these {{ties to the}} Latin Emperor {{provoked}} displeasure at the Byzantine court, for {{the time}} being relations remained good: the lease of Chios was renewed in 1324, and in 1327 Martino took part in alliance negotiations between the Byzantines and the Republic of Venice. At the same time, however, Martino's behaviour became increasingly assertive: ca. 1325 he ousted his brother as co-ruler of Chios and began minting coins in his own name. In 1328, the rise of a new and energetic emperor, Andronikos III Palaiologos, to the Byzantine throne, marked a turning-point in relations. One of the leading Chian nobles, Leo Kalothetos, went to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> emperor and his chief minister, John Kantakouzenos, to propose a reconquest of the island. Andronikos III readily agreed. On the pretext of Martino's unauthorized building of a new fortress on the island, the emperor sent him a letter in which he ordered him to cease construction, and to present himself in Constantinople in the next year in order to renew the island's lease. Martino haughtily rejected the demands and accelerated construction, but now his deposed brother Benedetto lodged a complaint with the emperor claiming the one-half share of the island's revenues that was his due. With these events as an excuse, in autumn 1329 Andronikos III assembled a fleet of 105 vessels—including the forces of the Latin Duke of Naxos, Nicholas I Sanudo—and sailed to Chios.|$|E

5|$|The route {{remained}} intact until {{the construction of}} the Southern Tier Expressway (STE) through Red House in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Unwanted tourism in Jimerson Town, a newly built settlement northeast of Red House, prompted Seneca leaders to seek ways to reduce through traffic in the settlement; to do so, the state built a trumpet interchange off the expressway where NY382 used to be, which, coupled with the flooding of the roadway of old Route 17 to the west, effectively cut Jimerson Town off from the highway system. The construction of the highway also allowed the state to claim eminent domain over most of the hamlet of Red House, leading to the hamlet's destruction; the few remaining private residences in the town as of 2015 are located southwest of what was Route 382. When the interchange at exit19 of the STE was constructed , NY382 was disconnected from Allegany State Park Route2, which was realigned to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> exit (as was Bay State Road, much of which was moved to a route south of and parallel to the expressway). The NY382 designation was removed around this time as a result. The roadway still runs from the former NY17 (now NY951T, which terminates near the former NY382's end at a dilapidated bridge) to the Exit 19 on/off ramp, but due to safety concerns, the road was blocked off at its eastern terminus.|$|E
