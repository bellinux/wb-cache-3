40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} companies {{are getting more}} inclined towards patient support programs (PSPs) which assist patients and/or healthcare professionals (HCPs) in more desirable disease management and cost-effective treatment. The utmost objective of these programs is patient care. The PSPs may include financial assistance to patients, medicine compliance programs, access to HCPs via phone or online chat centers, etc. The PSP has {{a crucial role in}} terms of customer acquisition and retention strategies. During the conduct of these programs, <b>Marketing</b> <b>Authorisation</b> <b>Holder</b> (MAH) may receive information related to concerned medicinal products, which is usually reported by patients or involved HCPs. This information may include suspected adverse reaction(s) during/after administration of medicinal products. Hence, the MAH should design PSP to comply with regulatory reporting requirements and avoid non-compliance during PV inspection. The emergence of wireless health devices is lowering the burden on patients to manually incorporate safety data, and building a significant option for patients to observe major swings in reference to drug safety. Therefore, to enhance the adoption of these programs, MAH not only needs to aware patients about advantages of the program, but also recognizes the importance of time of patients and commitments made in a constructive manner. It is indispensable that strengthening the public health is considered as the topmost priority in such programs, and the MAH is compliant to Pharmacovigilance (PV) requirements along with regulatory obligations...|$|E
40|$|Background: Orphan drug {{regulation}} {{was created}} {{out of the}} idea that patients suffering from rare conditions should be entitled to the same quality of treatment as other patients. Some conditions however, are so rare that a thorough clinical development programme, normally required, is practically impossible. In these cases the European Medicines Agency (EMA) can authorise a drug under exceptional circumstances. Aim and research questions: This report aims to provide insight into the authorisation under exceptional circumstances of oncology drugs. We tried to answer the following questions: What clinical data were presented by the applicant and what were the considerations by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) for granting exceptional circumstances? What were the additional requirements to be fulfilled by the <b>marketing</b> <b>authorisation</b> <b>holder?</b> What additional data became available on the originally licenced indication, and did it confirm the initial expectations? How do reimbursement agencies assess these drugs? Are there any patient access schemes for these drugs? Do the patients have access to the drugs? Methods: This report considered oncology drugs currently licenced under exceptional circumstances. Reimbursement agencies from England, Scotland, Belgium, France and the Netherlands were included. A MEDLINE-search for literature was performed through Pubmed and grey literature was included from EMA and the reimbursement agencies. Results: Four oncologic drugs are currently licensed under exceptional circumstances; clofarabine, nelarabine, trabectedin and histamine dihydrochloride. Histamine dihydrochloride was the only drug tested in a phase III trial. For clofarabine, nelarabine and trabectedin the justification for the authorisation under exceptional circumstances was the small size of the patient population. For histamine dihydrochloride it was unclear. Most of the additional requirements by the CHMP considered safety measures and they were not always completed within the set time-frame. The methods of the reimbursement assessments varied. One patient access scheme was identified for trabectedin in England. Some of the drugs were not accessible in some countries and for others it was unclear. Conclusion and recommendation: To successfully develop drugs for very rare conditions, it is important that industry, EMA and reimbursement agencies intensify the collaboration. On introduction these drugs cannot always prove their cost-effectiveness, therefore conditional coverage with evidence development, preferably on an international level, should be encouraged and facilitated...|$|E
30|$|Compared {{to common}} adverse events (for review see McKnight et al. 2012), cancer {{has long been}} {{considered}} a secondary problem in patients treated with lithium. However, the interest in the potential association between lithium therapy and tumors has recently been revived by a document issued by the European Medicine Agency (EMA) (2015), which adopted the following recommendation: “in light of the data available, the PRAC (Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee) has agreed that the evidence is sufficient to conclude that long-term use of lithium may induce microcysts, oncocytomas and collecting duct renal carcinomas. Therefore, the <b>Marketing</b> <b>Authorisation</b> <b>Holders</b> of lithium containing medicinal products should submit a variation within 2  months, to amend the product information. The document also recommends that routine pharmacovigilance should be performed {{in order to better}} characterize the risk ([URL] The present study was prompted by a series of circumstances: (a) our group serves as the Sardinian Pharmacovigilance Center; (b) our group has been running a lithium clinic since the 1970 s and is in possession of detailed clinical data regarding patients on maintenance treatment with lithium; (c) in 2015, {{a few months after the}} publication of the aforementioned EMA document, we observed the case of a woman treated with lithium for 18  years who was diagnosed with both thyroid and renal tumors.|$|R
40|$|Concerns {{about the}} high cost of orphan drugs has led to {{questions}} being asked about the generosity of the incentives for development, and associated company profits. We conducted a retrospective, propensity score matched study of publicly-listed orphan companies. Cases were defined as holders of orphan drug <b>market</b> <b>authorisation</b> in Europe or the USA between 2000 - 12. Control companies were selected based on their propensity for being orphan drug <b>market</b> <b>authorisation</b> <b>holders.</b> We applied system General Method of Moments to test whether companies with orphan drug market authorization are valued higher, as measured by the Tobin's Q and market to book value ratios, and are more profitable based on return on assets, than non-orphan drug companies. 86 companies with orphan drug approvals in European (4), USA (61) or both (21) markets were matched with 258 controls. Following adjustment, orphan drug market authorization holders have a 9. 6 % (95 % confidence interval, 0. 6 % to 18. 7 %) higher return on assets than non-orphan drug companies; Tobin's Q was higher by 9. 9 % (1. 0 % to 19. 7 %); market to book value by 15. 7 % (3. 1 % to 30. 0 %) and operating profit by 516 % (CI 19. 8 % to 1011 %). For each additional orphan drug sold, return on assets increased by 11. 1 % (0. 6 % to 21. 3 %), Tobin's Q by 2. 7 % (0. 2 % to 5. 2 %), and market to book value ratio by 5. 8 % (0. 7 % to 10. 9 %).

40|$|Introduction: Patients’ {{perceptions}} of side effect risks are important influences on their medicine-taking behaviour. A previous survey of Patient Information Leaflets (PILs) showed considerable {{variation in the}} terms used to communicate risks. Objective: Our objective {{was to assess the}} methods used to describe risk of side effects in recent PILs and to compare them with PILs sampled in 2006. Method: We sampled PILs for the 50 most frequently dispensed medicines in England and Wales in 2012 and PILs for the 50 most recently licensed medicines. We assessed the use of risk frequency terms or numbers, {{and the use of the}} risk format recommended by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Results: A majority (76 %) of PILs for the most frequently dispensed medicines included a risk frequency descriptor, with 66 % using the recommended format. No difference was seen between PILs for branded and generic medicines. All 50 PILs for the most recently licensed medicines used the EU recommended risk format. PILs from the 2012 sample were much more likely than those from the 2006 sample to include risk descriptors and to use a consistent approach. Conclusion: The increased use and consistency of risk descriptors in PILs should benefit patients, particularly those using multiple medicines produced by different <b>market</b> <b>authorisation</b> <b>holders.</b> A need remains for further research evaluating the risk format recommended by the EMA. There is also a need for research evaluating spoken information and other sources of printed risk information about medicines that is available to patients...|$|R

40|$|Problem: The Smart Open Services for European Patients (epSOS) the {{exchange}} of electronic Patient Summaries and ePrescriptions between selected member states of the European Union (EU). This project basically solved the ‘communication’ or message transfer problem. However, it encountered a serious ‘delivery’ problem: the safe dispensation of a medicinal product noted in a prescription from a given country by a retail pharmacist in another country. The reason for this was that the specified medicine could in many instances not univocally be identified – the same name may identify a product with a different active ingredient, or the product with identical composition may carry a different name in the other country. If the prescribed medicine had not been authorised for marketing in the other country, information on its attributes may not be available. This rendered dispensation by the pharmacist impossible, even where substitution would, in principle, be allowed and possible. Objectives: This paper reports on the goal, activities and achievements of the openMedicine project towards development of a digital solution and its implementation to meet this identification and the resulting delivery challenge. European-wide and cross-Atlantic endeavours to enhance pharmacovigilance {{by being able to}} match adverse event reports filed under different drug names which provide, however, for the same active ingredient(s) were developed upon. And the need for and benefits of being able to trace for clinical purposes, e. g. the longer-term treatment with the same active ingredient, even when the name of the prescribed medicine changed several times, were explored. Methodological approach: The openMedicine project was funded by the European Commission (EC) on behalf of member states to analyse this European-wide problem. Work benefitted from the epSOS project and work by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the USA Federal Drug Agency (FDA), and standard development organisations (SDOs). Reviews of white and grey literature, reports, regulatory documents, standards and other documents were undertaken. An online survey of 160 experts in all EU member states contributed empirical evidence. Work gained from discussions within an Expert Council representing core players and stakeholders in Europe and North America, and regional workshops across the EU and at the FDA. They also contributed towards validation of results. Results: The fragmentation of national markets for medicinal products lies {{at the root of the}} identification problem. About 600, 000 different products are marketed across the Union, but even in a large country like Germany only ca. 50, 000 are readily available. The great flexibility of <b>marketing</b> <b>authorisation</b> <b>holders</b> to provide different names for the same or equivalent products in different countries adds to this identification challenge, and naming issues related to legacy products complicate it further. – Options to identify medicinal products in a prescription are analysed, like noting a package code, the brand name of the product, the specification of an active substance only, or of a subset of similar products, from which the pharmacist has to choose. The EU-wide adoption of the International Standards Organisation’s (ISO) Identification of Medicinal Products (IDMP) suite of standards, as already under way by EMA and FDA for pharmacovigilance purposes, is proposed. Through globally agreed coding of packages, medicinal as well as pharmaceutical products, substances, dose forms, and other identifying attributes as needed, the identification as well as partly the ‘delivery’ problem can be solved. This will require linking to a central data base maintained by EMA, and the synchronisation of national as well as commercial medicinal and pharmaceutical product data bases with it. The full solution of the delivery problem will, however, also depend on the introduction – in countries where this is not yet allowed – and the relaxation respectively harmonisation of national substitution rules. Of course, if no equivalent product is available, delivery will fail – or require import from another country. Conclusions: Implementing digital infrastructures facilitating the univocal identification of medicinal products in regulatory and clinical contexts will generate long-term benefits for patient safety, pharmacovigilance, and positive socio-economic impacts for all key players. Harmonising the identification of medicines in regulatory processes as well as clinical documents is well on its way, but a European approach towards common processes for validation of contents, error mitigation, of linking from central hubs to national and regional levels, updates and mappings to other systems will require intensified cooperation of all stakeholders in years to come...|$|R
