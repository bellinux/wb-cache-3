25|$|Railway {{electrification}} in Great Britain began {{during the}} late 19th century. A range of voltages has been used, employing both overhead lines and conductor rails; the two <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>systems</b> are 25 kV AC using overhead lines and the 750VDC third rail system used in southeast England and on Merseyrail. In 2006, 40%— of the British rail network was electrified, and 60% of all rail journeys were by electric traction (both by locomotives and multiple units).|$|E
25|$|Stadtbahn, {{literally}} city railway in the German language, is {{the term}} for light rail in Germany and is the predecessor of the North American light rail. Most German light rail systems were started in the 1960s and 1970s {{with the intention of}} establishing full-scale underground/subway structures, or U-Bahn (short for Untergrundbahn) systems. By the 1980s virtually all cities had abandoned these plans due to the high costs of converting tramways, and the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>systems</b> now are a mixture of tramway-like operations in suburban areas, and a U-Bahn like mode of operation, featuring underground stations, in the city centres.|$|E

The psychrometric ratio of air-water vapor mixtures is approximately unity, which implies {{that the difference between}} the adiabatic saturation temperature and wet bulb temperature of air-water vapor mixtures is small. This property of air-water vapor systems simplifies drying and cooling calculations often performed using psychrometic relationships.|$|E
