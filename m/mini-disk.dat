40|$|We {{present the}} first {{exploration}} of relativistic gas dynamics {{in the immediate}} vicinity of binary black holes as the system inspirals close to merger in the gravitational radiation-driven regime. We focus on 2 D hydrodynamical studies of comparable-mass, non-spinning systems. Relativistic effects alter the dynamics of gas in this environment in several ways. Because the gravitational potential between the two black holes becomes shallower than in the Newtonian regime, the <b>mini-disks</b> stretch toward the L 1 point and the amount of gas passing {{back and forth between the}} <b>mini-disks</b> increases sharply with decreasing binary separation. This "sloshing" is quasi-periodically modulated at 2 and 2. 75 times the binary orbital frequency, corresponding to timescales of hours to days for supermassive binary black holes. In addition, relativistic effects add an m= 1 component to the tidally-driven spiral waves in the disks that are purely m= 2 in Newtonian gravity; this component becomes dominant when the separation is ≲ 100 gravitational radii. Both the sloshing and the spiral waves have the potential to create distinctive radiation features that may uniquely mark supermassive binary black holes in the relativistic regime.

Mass flow through the accretion streams linking the circumbinary disk to the mini-disks is modulated quasi-periodically by the streams' interaction with a nonlinear m= 1 density feature, or "lump", at the inner edge of the circumbinary disk: the stream supplying each <b>mini-disk</b> comes into phase with the lump at a frequency 0. 74 times the binary orbital frequency. Because the binary is relativistic, the tidal truncation radii of the mini-disks are not much larger than their innermost stable circular orbits; consequently, the mini-disks' inflow times are shorter than the conventional estimate and are comparable to the stream modulation period. As a result, the mini-disks are always in inflow disequilibrium, with their masses and spiral density wave structures responding to the stream's quasi-periodic modulation.

With a modified lomb-scargle code GLSdeDRW and the auto-correlation analysis ACF, we detect two significant (at P> 99 %) periodic signals at ~ 741 day and ~ 1500 {{day from the}} 8. 1 -year Catalina V-band light curve of this quasar. The period ratio, which is close to 1 : 2, is typical of a black-hole binary system with a mass ratio of 0. 05 <q< 0. 8 according to recent numerical simulations. SDSS J 0159 + 0105 has two SDSS spectroscopic observations separated by ~ 10 years.

From the single BLR assumption and the orbital period t_orb ~ 1500 day, we estimate the total virial masses of M_SMBHB ~ 1. 3 x 10 ^ 8 M_sun, the average distances of BLR of ~ 0. 04 pc (~ 50 light-day, with +/- 0. 3 dex uncertainty), and a SMBHB separation of d= (0. 01 pc) M_{ 8,tot}^{ 1 / 3 } (T_rest/ 3. 3 yr) ^{ 2 / 3 } ~ 0. 013 pc (15 light-day).

This is the first interferometric imaging of molecular gas in the most luminous galaxy within z= 0. 01. There is a large disk of molecular gas (r > 3 kpc) {{in the center of}} the merger with a strong gas concentration toward the double nucleus. The gas disk having a mass of ~ 3 * 10 ^ 9 Msun in the central 3 kpc rotates around a point between the two nuclei that are 850 pc apart on the sky. The molecular gas is warm and turbulent and shows spatial variation of the intensity ratio between CO isotopomers. High-velocity molecular gas is discovered at the galactic center. Its velocity in our line of sight is up to 420 km/s offset from the systemic velocity of the galaxy; the terminal velocity is twice as large as that due to the rotation of the main gas disk. The high-velocity gas is most likely due to a molecular outflow from the gas disk, entrained by the starburst-driven superwind in the galaxy. The molecular outflow is estimated to have a rate of ~ 10 Msun/yr and to play a significant role in the dispersal or depletion of molecular gas from the galactic center. A compact gas concentration and steep velocity gradient are also found around each of the twin nuclei. They are suggestive of a small gas disk rotating around each nucleus.

NGC 3368 and NGC 3786 have nuclear bars only, their isophotal twist on the larger radii being connected with the bright spiral arms. Three cases of inner polar disks in our sample (NGC 2681, NGC 3368 and NGC 5850) are considered. We found ionized-gas counter-rotation in the central kiloparsec of the lenticular galaxy NGC 3945.

ChandlerInfiltration {{capacity}} {{influences the}} ability of a soil to absorb and transmit water through macropores and micropores of the soil structure.

Spatial controls of land use, land cover, soil texture, slope position, slope gradient and slope aspect {{are a few of the}} variables influencing infiltration capacity within a uniform soil type. The goals of the thesis are to (1) quantify the spatial distribution of soil hydraulic properties at the surface of a hillslope using one measurement method - the automated <b>mini-disk</b> tension infiltrometer - and several analysis methods, (2) determine the dependence of depth on soil hydraulic properties using two measurement methods, and (3) compare the results of the investigation with information from the soil survey and soil investigations. First, automated <b>mini-disk</b> infiltrometers were used to determine soil hydraulic properties at ten sites along a hillslope in Konza Prairie Natural Research Area. Several analysis methods were used to extract hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity values from the infiltration data. Next, large intact soil cores were extracted from three selected sites at the same hillslope and analyzed at six depths using a large disk infiltrometer. Finally, the six segments of the large soil cores were analyzed using the same methods as the field measurements with the <b>mini-disk</b> infiltrometers. The results of the field investigation at the ten sites show a variability of soil hydraulic properties over an assumed homogeneous landscape. The values of hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity are dependent on the method of analysis. An empirically based approach produced more realistic values than a physically based approach. The results of the laboratory investigation of the three extracted soil cores also show a dependence of method of analysis and measurement. In addition, the results show a complex relationship among landscape position, depth, and soil structure.

Such a disk can be formed from an outer edge of the progenitor's envelope, especially for metal-poor massive stars and/or massive stars in close binaries. The disk accretion rate is typically super-Eddington and an ultrafast outflow with a velocity of ∼ 0. 1 - 0. 3 c will be launched into the circumstellar medium. The outflow forms a collisionless shock, and electrons are accelerated and emit synchrotron emission in radio bands with a flux of ∼ 10 ^ 26 - 30 erg s^- 1 Hz^- 1 days to decades after the BH formation. The model predicts not only a fast UV/optical transient but also quasi-simultaneous inverse-Compton X-ray emission ∼ {{a few days after the}} BH formation, and the discovery of the radio counterpart with coordinated searches will enable us to identify this type of transients.

40|$|Supermassive binary {{black holes}} (BBHs) are {{unavoidable}} products of galaxy mergers {{and are expected}} to exist in the cores of many quasars. Great effort has been made during the past several decades to search for BBHs among quasars; however, observational evidence for BBHs remains elusive and ambiguous, which is difficult to reconcile with theoretical expectations. In this paper, we show that the distinct optical-to-UV spectrum of Mrk 231 can be well interpreted as emission from accretion flows onto a BBH, with a semimajor axis of ~ 590 AU and an orbital period of ~ 1. 2 year. The flat optical and UV continua are mainly emitted from a circumbinary disk and a <b>mini-disk</b> around the secondary black hole (BH), respectively; and the observed sharp drop off and flux deficit at wavelength lambda ~ 4000 - 2500 Angstrom is due to a gap (or hole) opened by the secondary BH migrating within the circumbinary disk. If confirmed by future observations, this BBH will provide a unique laboratory to study the interplay between BBHs and accretion flows onto them. Our result also demonstrates a new method to find sub-parsec scale BBHs by searching for deficits in the optical-to-UV continuum among the spectra of quasars.

40|$|The {{hydraulic}} {{resistance of}} the surface crust was determined {{by a combination of}} two infiltrometric techniques: first, a surface measurement of steady-state infiltration rate is conducted by a <b>mini-disk</b> tension infiltrometer (MDI); then, the surface crust is removed, its thickness is measured, and a ponded infiltration test is performed at the same site. The Beerkan Estimation of Soil Transfer parameters (BEST) method is applied to estimate the hydraulic properties of the underlying soil provided the particlesize distribution and the bulk density are known. Under the assumption of a unit gradient of hydraulic head below the soil crust, the pressure head at the interface crust-soil is derived. Finally, the hydraulic conductivity of the crust is calculated from the steady-state water flow measured by the MDI and the Darcy law. The method was tested in a sandy loam and a clay soil. In the sandy loam soil, a 2 - 3 mm thick slaking crust was visually observed, but no increased surface hydraulic resistance was detected in 10 out of 11 cases.

This study {{presents the results of}} a field campaign documenting topsoil hydraulic properties in a small French suburban catchment (7 km 2) located near Lyon, France. Two types of infiltration tests were performed: single ring infiltration tests under positive head and tension-disk infiltration using a <b>mini-disk.</b> Both categories were processed using the BEST [...] Beerkan Estimation of Soil Transfer parameters [...] method to derive parameters describing the retention and hydraulic conductivity curves. Dry bulk density and particle size data were also sampled. Almost all the topsoils were found to belong to the sandy loam soil class. No significant differences in hydraulic properties were found in terms of pedologic units, but the results showed a high impact of land use on these properties. The lowest dry bulk density values were obtained in forested soils with the highest organic matter content. Permanent pasture soils showed intermediate values, whereas the highest values were encountered in cultivated lands. For saturated hydraulic conductivity, the highest values were found in broad-leaved forests and small woods. The complementary use of tension-disk and positive head infiltration tests highlighted a sharp increase of hydraulic conductivity between near saturation and saturated conditions, attributed to macroporosity effect. The ratio of median saturated hydraulic conductivity to median hydraulic conductivity at a pressure of − 20 mm of water was about 50. The study suggests that soil texture, such as used in most pedo-transfer functions, might not be sufficient to properly map the variability of soil hydraulic properties.

A distributed assessment of infiltration properties and their variability at the catchment scale is thus of great importance if accurate simulation of the water balance are expected on such catchments. This paper presents a field campaign conducted in a 7 km 2 peri-urban catchment, located in the Mont du Lyonnais area, close to the city of Lyon (France) in order to document the topsoil hydraulic properties. The sampling strategy was set up in order to sample the largest number of soil/land use combinations. The locations were chosen from a GIS analysis based on the overlapping of the pedology and land use maps, and accessibility consideration.

The percentage of exposed mineral soil and litter cover proved to be the best predictors of burn severity in this environment. Two burn severity classifications, one from a statistical classification tree and the other a Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) burn severity map, were compared with measured ‘ground truth ’ burn severity at 183 plots and were 56 % and 69 % accurate, respectively.

Soil samples were taken in all subplots, except in the center subplot where erosion pins were installed. Erosion data was highly variable, but a correlation was shown between tree density and soil activity. Each soil sample was comprised of three soil core samples (15 cm) randomly selected in each subplot. Using KCl extraction, results showed that high nitrate and ammonia rates correlate with slope, soil pH, and tree density. The available soil nitrogen was shown to increase with basal area of eastern redcedar, indicating that ladder fuels like cedar add to the intensity of the fire and therefore the lasting impacts on the area’s resources. A <b>mini-disk</b> infiltrometer was used to test for soil hydraulic conductivity and hydrophobicity. The results indicated that further testing of the soil profile was needed to evaluate hydrophobicity, but soils within areas of higher densities of trees were indicating hydrophobic characteristics. Further research is needed to understand the complete relationship between the soil health and the wildfire, {{especially when it comes to}} eastern redcedar encroachment on these ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|The {{hydraulic}} {{properties of}} the topsoil control the partition of rainfall into infiltration and runoff at the soil surface. They must be characterized for distributed hydrological modelling. This study {{presents the results of}} a field campaign documenting topsoil hydraulic properties in a small French suburban catchment (7 km 2) located near Lyon, France. Two types of infiltration tests were performed: single ring infiltration tests under positive head and tension disk infiltration using a <b>mini-disk.</b> Both categories were processed using the BEST Beerkan Estimation of Soil Transfer parameters- method to derive parameters describing the retention and hydraulic conductivity curves. Dry bulk density and particle size data were also sampled. Almost all the topsoils were found to belong to the sandy loam soil class. No significant differences in hydraulic properties were found in terms of pedologic units, but the results showed a high impact of land use on these properties. The lowest dry bulk density values were obtained in forested soils with the highest organic matter content. Permanent pasture soils showed intermediate values, whereas the highest values were encountered in cultivated lands. For saturated hydraulic conductivity, the highest values were found in broad leaved forests and small woods. The complementary use of tension disk and positive head infiltration tests highlighted a sharp increase of hydraulic conductivity between near saturation and saturated conditions, attributed to macroporosity effect. The ratio of median saturated hydraulic conductivity to median hydraulic conductivity at a pressure of - 20 mm of water, was about 50. The study suggests that soil texture, such as used in most pedo-transfer functions, might not be sufficient to properly map the variability of soil hydraulic properties. Land use information should be considered in the parameterizations of topsoil within hydrological models to better represent in situ conditions, as illustrated in the paper...|$|E
40|$|Supermassive binary {{black holes}} (SMBBHs) {{represent}} an excellent candidate for future combined gravitational wave and electromagnetic astrophysics, {{commonly referred to}} as multimessenger astrophysics. While much is known about the gravitational wave signal of merging BBHs, {{little is known about the}} electromagnetic emission. Modeling the electromagnetic emission coincident with gravitational waves requires simulations of SMBBHs coupled to their astrophysical environment, particularly during the late stages of inspiral and merger. These simulations necessitate a broad range of physics including general relativity, magnetohydrodynamics, and radiation physics. In this Dissertation we present simulations of SMBBHs coupled to their astrophysical environment. We explore, for the first time, the gas dynamics in a relativistic binary black hole (BBH) system in which an accretion disk (a 2 ̆ 2 <b>mini-disk</b> 2 ̆ 2) orbits each black hole. In addition to studying the structure and dynamics of the mini-disks, we present spectra from ray-tracing calculations of SMBBH accretion including mini-disks. Due to the immense computational burden of these simulations (millions of CPU hours per binary orbit), we restrict our study to equal-mass, non-spinning SMBBHs. Relativistic effects alter the dynamics of gas in this environment in several ways. Because the gravitational potential between the two black holes becomes shallower than in the Newtonian regime, the mini-disks stretch toward the L 1 point and the amount of gas passing back and forth between the mini-disks increases sharply with decreasing binary separation. This sloshing is quasi-periodically modulated at 2 and 2. 75 times the binary orbital frequency, corresponding to timescales of hours to days for SMBBHs. In addition, relativistic effects add an azimuthal m = 1 component to the tidally driven spiral waves in the disks that are purely m = 2 in Newtonian gravity; this component becomes dominant when the separation is 3 ̆c 100 gravitational radii. We find that the spiral structure of the mini-disks is further altered through a coupling of the mini-disks to an m= 1 mode in the circumbinary accretion disk via streams of gas peeled off the inner edge of the latter. This modulation in the accretion stream flux has a quasi-periodic nature of 0. 74 times the binary orbital frequency. Both the sloshing and the spiral waves have the potential to create distinctive radiation features that may uniquely mark SMBBHs in the relativistic regime. Finally, we observe a broadened thermal spectrum due to the combined photospheres of the mini-disks and circumbinary disks in the range of approximately 1 - 1000 eV, and an inverse Compton spectrum at tens to hundreds of keV dominated by the mini-disks...|$|E
