40|$|Mitochondrial protein import {{involves}} {{the recognition of}} preproteins by receptors and their subsequent translocation across the outer membrane. In Neurospora crassa, the two import receptors, <b>MOM</b> 19 <b>and</b> <b>MOM</b> 72, were found in a complex with the general insertion protein, GIP (formed by MOM 7, MOM 8, <b>MOM</b> 30 <b>and</b> <b>MOM</b> 38) <b>and</b> <b>MOM</b> 22. We isolated a complex out of S. cerevisiae mitochondria consisting of MOM 38 /ISP 42, the receptor <b>MOM</b> 72, <b>and</b> five new yeast proteins, the putative equivalents of N. crassa MOM 7, MOM 8, MOM 19, <b>MOM</b> 22 <b>and</b> <b>MOM</b> 30. A receptor complex isolated out of yeast cells transformed with N. crassa MOM 19 contained the N. crassa master receptor {{in addition to the}} yeast proteins. This demonstrates that the yeast complex is functional, and provides strong evidence that we also have identified the yeast MOM 19. ...|$|R
