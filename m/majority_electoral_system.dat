40|$|One of the {{patterns}} familiar to students of comparative politics is the clustering of specific forms {{of democracy in}} different world regions. Thus, continental Europe is typified by the combination of parliamentary government and proportional-representation (PR) <b>electoral</b> <b>systems,</b> Latin America is almost entirely presidential but with PR legislative elections, and the Anglosphere is mostly parliamentary (the rather large exception of the United States aside) but also determinedly majoritarian in using plurality or <b>majority</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> (with the somewhat less large exception of New Zealand). The democratization of East Asia is producing a similar effect, with a distinctive form of electoral majoritarianism emerging in the region’s new democracies. However, there is strong subregional variation between Northeast and Southeast Asia, and increasingly between mainland and maritime Southeast Asia as well. Thus the “third wave” Northeast Asian democracies of Mongolia, South Korea, and Taiwan are distinguished by their combination of (semi) presidential government, mixed-member <b>electoral</b> <b>systems,</b> and nascent two-party politics. In Southeast Asia, by contrast, two countervailing clusters prevail: one-party-dominant parliamentary systems in the “semidemocracies” of Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, and possibly Thailand; and more complex electoral models and fragmented party systems in the presidential or semipresidential Southeast Asian democracies of Indonesia, the Philippines, and Timor-Leste...|$|R

40|$|The {{expanding}} {{literature on}} electoral reform {{has proposed a}} comprehensive approach towards <b>electoral</b> <b>system</b> change arguing that going beyond the simple logic of maximising gains for the dominant political elite allows for assessing normative drivers behind the change (Hazan-Leyenaar, 2014). Indeed, <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> tend to fulfil normative expectations like providing fair representation and stable government. More nuanced, practical concerns such as making elections cheaper or more intelligible are also regarded as their assets.

The controversy about the proportional System of voting has been agitating France for the past century, from 1888 to 1985. PR, {{to be used for}} the 1986 elections, triggered off a tough fight between 1906 and 1913 during the glorious hours of the radical Republic. It has never since then disappeared from the political horizon, and still alters the traditional cleavages. But this debate between followers of RP and those of the <b>majority</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>System</b> is a mere convenience. The unfaithful children of the majority System of 1914, 1936 or 1981 imposed it in 1919, 1945 and 1985.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the quality of {{democracy}}, and its purpose is to examine which factors affect the varying levels of the quality of democracy in the stable democracies in the world. The research question posited in the study is: what explains the varying levels of the quality of democracy in the democratic countries in the world, and do political institutions matter? Theoretically, the quality of democracy is distinguished from other similar concepts employed in comparative politics, and what the quality of democracy stands for is clarified. The quality of democracy is defined in this study as: the level of legitimacy in a democratic system with respect to democratic norms such as political participation, political competition, political equality, and rule of law. In total, four dimensions of the quality of democracy are included that are considered to be very important dimensions of the quality of democracy. These dimensions are political participation, political competition, political equality, and the rule of law. To explain the variation in the quality of democracy, an explanatory model has been developed. The explanatory model consists of five different groups of independent variables: political institutional variables, socioeconomic variables, cultural variables, historical variables, and physical variables. Methodologically, a large-n, outcome-centric research design is employed and statistical analysis is used to examine what effect the five groups of independent variables have on the four dimensions of the quality of democracy. Empirically, the results show that cultural variables and political institutional variables outperform socioeconomic, historical, and physical variables in relation to their effect on the quality of democracy. Consequently, cultural and political institutional variables are the two most important groups of variables when explaining the variation in the quality of democracy in the democratic countries in the world. In relation to the other groups of variables, historical variables are slightly more important than socioeconomic variables when explaining the variation in the quality of democracy. The physical variables constitute the group of variables that has the least importance out of the five groups of variables when explaining the variation in the quality of democracy. In summary, the findings from the study show that the best way of increasing the level of the quality of democracy may be to choose political institutions such as parliamentarism as the executive power system and a proportional <b>system</b> as the <b>electoral</b> <b>system.</b> To put this clearly, to increase the possibility of democratic countries achieving a high level of the quality of democracy they should avoid <b>majority</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> and presidential or semipresidential executive systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{electoral system}} {{constitutes}} a crucial {{factor for the}} formation of the party system, the political and the parliamentary systems. Anyway between the electoral and the party systems functions no one-way causal nexus. In view of the first post-war elections (1946), efforts were made for an approach between the Populists and the Liberals, while the controversy between the Regent and the Government about the electoral system ended through the intervention of the British in favor of the latter. The beginning of the post-war era finds the party system in Greece in a state of unstable balance. The electoral system’s problem occupies a central position in the post-civil war conjuncture. The political landscape’s fragmenting, the “transitional” character of the first post-civil war Parliament and the governmental instability that followed characterize the Greek political life after the civil war. Soon (in 1951) political and institutional developments moved towards the introduction of a model of the “reinforced” proportional representation’ s electoral system. The elections results indicated the partial confirmation and the partial contradiction of the pre-electoral calculations, on which the architects of the electoral law of 1951 were based. The enactment of the Constitution of 1952 was followed by a political controversy, which was marked by the “allied factor’s” open interventions and lead to the establishment of the <b>majority</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>system.</b> The outcome of the electoral fight of 1952 meant the transition from “polarized multi-pluralism” to the “dominant party’s system”. The new government adopted (in 1954) an extreme <b>majority</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>system,</b> which, although it remained unapplied, indicated clearly the tendencies of political dominance that certain political forces cherished in that particular conjuncture. The establishment of a complicated mixed electoral system accompanied the appearance of a new leader (K. Karamanlis) in the political landscape (1955 - 1956). Its application contributed to the formation of the unique in Greek history “popular front” and produced a singular election result. In 1958 through an intricate political procedure the “reinforced” proportional representation’s electoral system was established. In spite of the common designation, the institutional profile of the new electoral system presented important differences compared to that of 1951. The electoral fight’s outcome raised EDA (the “United Democratic Left”) to the rank of the opposition’s largest party. In 1961 a persistent demand and a long debate concerning the adoption of a new electoral system characterized the conjuncture. The Government responded to this demand by making certain “concessions”. But the opposition denounced the conditions in which the elections took place as highly irregular. The “reinforced” proportional representation’ s system was once again modified in 1963 during a period of political turmoil, which was marked by crucial political and institutional developments. The limited electoral reform of 1963 however had no essential impact on the party formations’ s parliamentary representation. On the eve of the April’s coup (1967) and in the palace intervention’ s (1965 - 1967) conjuncture an unsuccessful effort was made towards the reintroduction of the proportional representation’ s electoral system. The political and institutional developments concerning the electoral system indicated a group of consensus elements that characterized the political life in Greece during the first post-war decades. ...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Political Studies)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. The Republic of South Africa {{entered into}} a new {{constitutional}} dispensation in 1994. As part of this new constitutional dispensation, a new <b>electoral</b> <b>system,</b> i. e. the closed-list proportional representative <b>electoral</b> <b>system,</b> was adopted. This <b>electoral</b> <b>system</b> was accepted for elections {{on a national level}} of representatives for the National Assembly and has certain advantages and disadvantages. Some political scientists, political parties and opinion formers are of the opinion that this <b>electoral</b> <b>system</b> brings about poor contact between the representatives in the National Assembly (Parliament) and the voters. Critics are also of the opinion that party leaders obtain too much power within this <b>electoral</b> <b>system,</b> in that the parties appoint candidates to the candidate lists. In elections, voters vote for specific political parties and therefore do not have a choice with regard to who their representatives are. The result is that South Africa adheres to the representative aspect of democracy, but is lacking with regard to the accounting of representatives to voters. The legitimacy of Parliament is impaired by this defect. The aim {{of this study is to}} provide a critical analysis and investigate alternative frameworks of the South African <b>electoral</b> <b>system</b> and its functioning on a national level. In the analysis it is determined to what extent the South African <b>electoral</b> <b>system</b> meets the criteria set for an <b>electoral</b> <b>system</b> to ensure the legitimacy of Parliament, a sustainable representative democracy and an accountable government in the long term in the country. This analysis and evaluation was used to determine whether the existing closed-list proportional representative <b>electoral</b> <b>system</b> is the most suitable <b>electoral</b> <b>system</b> for South Africa and, if not, to identify and analyse an alternative <b>electoral</b> <b>system</b> for South Africa. The analysis entails a literature overview analysis of <b>electoral</b> <b>systems.</b> From the study it appears that modern democracies use a wide variety of different <b>electoral</b> <b>systems.</b> There is consensus that no single best <b>electoral</b> <b>system</b> exists which could be used by all countries, since every country has its distinctive circumstances and an <b>electoral</b> <b>system’s</b> functioning and outcomes are affected by it. In this study, twelve different <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> are identified with specific advantages and disadvantages. Criteria were set with which <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> had to comply in order to promote democracy and ensure the legitimacy of Parliament. These criteria require that <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> have to promote and ensure broad representation, accessible and meaningful elections, reconciliation, stable and effective government, accountability of government, accountability of representatives, promotion of political parties, opposition and oversight, sustainability of the electoral process, and international standards. The listed criteria were placed in order of priority according to those which are the most important in the current South African circumstances. In accordance with this, an evaluation model was drawn up which was quantified in order to calculate the extent to which every <b>electoral</b> <b>system</b> met the requirements and priority order. In determining the order of priority of the requirements in the criteria, the historical circumstances of South Africa, of discord, conflict, racial hatred, riots and suspicion between races, were taken into account. When applying the evaluation model to the twelve different <b>electoral</b> <b>systems,</b> it was found that the current closed-list proportional representative <b>electoral</b> <b>system</b> is the most suitable <b>electoral</b> <b>system</b> for South Africa and should be retained. In terms of the criticism of the current <b>electoral</b> <b>system,</b> the conclusion drawn is that <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> cannot ensure the measure of accountability of representatives. It is ensured by the internal rules and discipline of the political parties they represent. The contribution of <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> to the accountability of representatives is to ensure that voters have a choice between more than one candidate, or more than one political party at a following election. Furthermore, <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> also do not appoint candidates in an election; the respective political parties appoint them.
