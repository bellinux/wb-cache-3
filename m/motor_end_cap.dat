30|$|The {{role of the}} <b>end</b> <b>cap</b> is {{to prevent}} nail migration, which may prevent soft-tissue {{irritation}} and leg shortening. Furthermore, the <b>end</b> <b>caps</b> might also simplify implant removal [30]. However, biomechanical data is inconclusive regarding {{the contribution of the}} <b>end</b> <b>caps</b> to the stability of a pediatric femur shaft fracture. A biomechanical study by Volpon and colleagues on distal femur fractures indicates that <b>end</b> <b>caps</b> fitted to elastic nails may add to the stability of distal femur fracture fixation [5]. This is in contrast to a biomechanical study by Kaiser and colleagues, who could not find any improvement in the stability of a specimen with a midshaft spiral fracture stabilized with TEN and <b>end</b> <b>caps</b> [22]. Nectoux and colleagues supported the use of <b>end</b> <b>caps</b> for length-unstable fractures based on the results in a small case series on tibia and femur shaft fractures in children [30]. It was not the intent of our study to evaluate whether or not <b>end</b> <b>caps</b> improved the stability in our fracture model. We chose to use <b>end</b> <b>caps</b> in our model because even though <b>end</b> <b>caps</b> may or may not add axial or torsional stability to the fracture, it is the manufacturer’s recommendation to use <b>end</b> <b>caps</b> in length-unstable fractures [31].|$|R

40|$|<b>End</b> <b>caps</b> are {{intended}} to prevent nail migration (push-out) in elastic stable intramedullary nailing. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the force at failure with and without <b>end</b> <b>caps,</b> and whether different insertion angles of nails and <b>end</b> <b>caps</b> would alter that force at failure. Simulated oblique fractures of the diaphysis were created in 15 artificial paediatric femurs. Titanium Elastic Nails with <b>end</b> <b>caps</b> were inserted at angles of 45 °, 55 ° and 65 ° in five specimens for each angle to create three study groups. Biomechanical testing was performed with axial compression until failure. An identical fracture was created in four small adult cadaveric femurs harvested from two donors (both female, aged 81 and 85 years, height 149 cm and 156 cm, respectively). All femurs were tested without and subsequently with <b>end</b> <b>caps</b> inserted at 45 °. In the artificial femurs, maximum force was not significantly different between the three groups (p = 0. 613). Push-out force was significantly higher in the cadaveric specimens with the use of <b>end</b> <b>caps</b> by an up to sixfold load increase (830 N, standard deviation (SD) 280 vs 150 N, SD 120, respectively; p = 0. 007). These results indicate that the nail and <b>end</b> <b>cap</b> insertion angle can be varied within 20 ° without altering construct stability and that the risk of elastic stable intramedullary nailing push-out can be effectively reduced by the use of <b>end</b> <b>caps...</b>|$|R
40|$|Norbornenyl-end capped PMR {{polyimide}} resins {{are widely}} used as polymer matrix composite materials for aircraft engine applications, since they combine ease of processing with good oxidative stability up to 300 C. PMR resins are prepared by a two-step approach involving the initial formation of oligomeric pre-polymers <b>capped</b> at both <b>ends</b> by a latent reactive <b>end</b> <b>cap.</b> The <b>end</b> <b>cap</b> undergoes cross-linking during higher temperature processing, producing the desired low density, high specific strength materials, for PMR- 15.

40|$|The surface {{composition}} of styrene polymers capped at {{one or both}} ends by perfluoro groups has been determined by ISS, XPS, and static SIMS. The homopolymers, with M(n) 29000 - 59000, have an excess of the perfluoro end groups at the surface that is inversely proportional to the chain length and is commensurate with one or both ends having perfluoro groups. In contrast, double perfluoro <b>end</b> <b>capped</b> homopolymers of M(n) similar to 9000 have {{only one of the}} perfluoro groups at the surface. In blends of perfluoro <b>end</b> <b>capped</b> styrene with hydrogen-terminated styrene, the fluorinated <b>end</b> <b>cap</b> causes the former to segregate to the surface.

40|$|Solar Turbines Gas Compressor Engineering Division of San Diego, California {{called upon}} the Mechanical Engineering {{students}} of California Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo to provide recommendations for optimization of compressor <b>end</b> <b>cap</b> port design. Various sizes of compressors have <b>end</b> <b>caps</b> with numerous ports that exchange fluids between {{the inside and}} outside of the working fluid pressure vessel. Because so many ports must exist on the <b>end</b> <b>caps,</b> unusual flow paths are created to supply the appropriate location within the compressor. These flow paths commonly consist of a drilled inlet hole which intersects with a sudden expansion. The sudden expansion is deemed the “fly cut” because of its semicircular shape. Sudden expansions in general cause very high energy losses in fluid flow. This is one of the primary concerns when designing the compressor <b>end</b> <b>cap</b> port layout. Due to the unusual nature of the fly cuts found in Solar Turbines’ <b>end</b> <b>caps,</b> published information on the pressure losses for this particular flow path do not exist. For this reason, Solar Turbines were required to base their port design on the best information available, including: historical compressor design methods, conservative design analysis estimates, and computational fluid mechanics software. Of these options, the computational method could provide the best estimate but only if validated experimentally. In response to this problem, PreFlow Systems was formed and investigated the solution of designing, building, and testing a scaled experimental test apparatus. This report outlines the details involved in every aspect of the project, including: technical specifications and objectives, design conceptualization, engineering analysis, manufacturing, testing, and results. Each of these phases was crucial in creating the final flow test apparatus which simulated the gas port flow of Solar Turbines’ compressor <b>end</b> <b>caps.</b> This apparatus ultimately provided an experimental basis for concluding that computation fluid mechanics software is a reasonable aide in <b>end</b> <b>cap</b> port design...|$|R
