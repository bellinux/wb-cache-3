2500|$|In 1931, {{after he}} left Kari-Keen, Swanson {{established}} the Swanson Aircraft [...] Co. Inc. with headquarters at Hopewell, Virginia, and built the Swanson Coupe W-15 whose design incorporated new breakthroughs such as {{a new type of}} patented wing <b>mounting</b> <b>structure</b> which enabled unobstructed view from the cockpit to both pilot and passenger even from above their heads. The new wing mounting technique also increased the peripheral field of view of the cabin. This was accomplished by eliminating an extra wing span which used to enter the cabin area and obstruct the ceiling of the cockpit thus limiting the overhead field of vision. The Swanson Coupe Model W-15 has been described as [...] "beautiful", and its cantilever wing design has been called [...] "ingenious". The plane was certified by the United States Department of Commerce and was powered by the Warner Scarab engine, which produced 85 h.p. at 1950 rpm.|$|E
2500|$|The {{two main}} {{problems}} facing Parnall when given an Air Ministry contract to produce such an aircraft were to ensure that, {{so far as}} possible the behaviour of the wing was unaffected by interference with the flow over the fuselage or by prop wash, and to devise a way of measuring lift and drag forces whilst in flight. [...] They decided on a parasol wing design, since this would avoid complications like wing root interference, and made the wing <b>mounting</b> <b>structure</b> into a single unit with some freedom to deflect internally so that the force could be measured. [...] A typical parasol wing aircraft has lift struts from the lower fuselage to the wing plus some upper fuselage struts to support the wing near the centre line. The Parasol had two lift struts under each wing, with their lower ends joined within the fuselage to a horizontal rectangular frame. Two inverted V members were also attached to this frame, one at the front and one at the back, rising almost vertically {{to the front and}} rear wing spars. [...] The V-struts were hinged top and bottom, allowing the wing to move parallel to the horizontal frame under aerodynamic loads. The force was measured by a dynamometer ahead of the front cockpit, via a linkage which ran down and forward from the wing at an angle of about 22°, then turned back to the instrument via a crank.|$|E

The kinematic design is deterministic and does not rely on probabilistic approach. Kinematic mounting can provice repeatable relocation capability with high accuracy, which {{is very important for}} many synchrotron radiation experimental applications, such as x-ray crystallography and x-ray microscopy. In this paper, we present a series of compact magnetic-based kinematic <b>mounting</b> <b>structures</b> developed for sample holders, optics holders and tools for x-ray beam diagnostics at the Advanced Photon Source.

50|$|Investigators {{found that}} {{oscillations}} in the wing had caused a stress fracture, {{the severity of}} which was exacerbated by the violent weather conditions in which the aircraft was flying. German investigators, however, determined that one fracture formed in the wing and engine <b>mount</b> <b>structure</b> due to defective construction and welding techniques {{in conjunction with the}} engine vibrations, while a second fracture resulted from the force of the turbulence in the storm.|$|R

In airplanes, engine <b>mounting</b> <b>structures</b> {{have two}} primary performances: 1 - They sustain all loads which engines {{produces}} or {{those which are}} exerted on engines in different maneuvering conditions. 2 - They make the thrust load and the centric line of its containing cabin concentric [1]. In this paper, analysis of a <b>mounting</b> engine <b>structure</b> {{with the purpose of}} the accurate adjustment of the engine in its cabin is presented. Some sample diagrams, which introduced ideal adjustment angles for a specific aircraft, is proposed. These diagrams are obtained {{with the help of a}} MATLAB program that can be used for any dimension of the engine and cabin. Therefore, with the aid of these diagrams or this code, the time of adjustment the engine in its cabin will be decreased so much...|$|R

The Amonix tracking system follows the sun from dawn to dusk to maintain the sun’s focus on the solar cell. This ensures that the system generates close to peak power output throughout the day and produces more energy to better match power demand from utilities.|$|E
50|$|A {{scramjet}} cannot produce efficient thrust unless boosted to high speed, around Mach 5, although {{depending on}} the design it could act as a ramjet at low speeds. A horizontal take-off aircraft would need conventional turbofan or rocket engines to take off, sufficiently large to move a heavy craft. Also needed would be fuel for those engines, plus all engine-associated <b>mounting</b> <b>structure</b> and control systems. Turbofan engines are heavy and cannot easily exceed about Mach 2-3, so another propulsion method {{would be needed to}} reach scramjet operating speed. That could be ramjets or rockets. Those would also need their own separate fuel supply, structure, and systems. Many proposals instead call for a first stage of droppable solid rocket boosters, which greatly simplifies the design.|$|E
50|$|Type A. A type A test {{is a test}} of a {{principal}} unit. This is the preferred test. Principal units are items which are directly supported by the ship structure or by a foundation which is directly attached to the ship structure, and items mounted in piping systems, ducting systems, and similar systems which are supported by ship structure. The shock response of {{a principal}} unit is primarily {{a function of the}} rigidity and mass of the item and the shipboard <b>mounting</b> <b>structure,</b> the shipboard mounting location, and the configuration of the item. Such items typically include diesel-generator sets, air conditioning plants, switchboards, radio transmitters, steam generators, missile launchers, and valves (if installed in piping which is supported by ship structure).|$|E

The modules are normally oriented towards the Equator, at a tilt angle slightly less than the latitude of the site.

40|$|Abstract. —Fin {{rays and}} spines are {{becoming}} more popular for age and growth analysis. A protocol for processing structures is first to <b>mount</b> the <b>structure</b> in epoxy, then to use a low-speed saw or handsaw to section the structure, and finally to estimate age from the resulting section. Unfortunately, scientists are often unaware of efficient techniques for <b>mounting</b> <b>structures</b> for such analyses. We describe a simple technique for mounting fin rays and spines in epoxy in preparation for sectioning. The advantages of this method include minimal preparation time, low cost, and little or no damage to hard structures. We have used this technique extensively to estimate age from the fin rays and spines of shovelnose sturgeon Scaphirhynchus platorynchus, catosto-mids, cyprinids, and ictalurids; however, this technique is useful for any species for which fin rays or spines are used i...|$|R

5000|$|Like all antennas, the J-pole is {{sensitive}} to electrically conductive objects in its induction fields (aka reactive near-field region [...] ) and should maintain sufficient separation to minimize these near field interactions as part of typical system installation considerations. [...] The quarter wave parallel transmission line stub has an external electromagnetic field with strength and size proportional to the spacing between the parallel conductors. [...] The parallel conductors must be kept free of moisture, snow, ice and should be kept away from other conductors including downspouts, metal window frames, flashing, etc. by a distance of {{two to three times}} the spacing between the parallel stub conductors. [...] The J-Pole is very sensitive to conductive support structures and will achieve best performance with no electrical bonding between antenna conductors and the <b>mounting</b> <b>structure.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The J-pole design {{functions}} {{well when}} fed with a balanced feed (via balun, transformer or choke) and no electrical connection exists between its conductors and surrounding supports. Historical {{documentation of the}} J antenna suggests {{the lower end of}} the matching stub is at zero potential with respect to earth and can connect to a grounding wire or mast with no effect on the antenna's operation. [...] Later research confirms the tendency of the mast or grounding wire to draw current from the antenna potentially spoiling the antenna pattern. [...] A common approach extends the conductor below the bottom of the J-pole resulting in additional and undesirable RF currents flowing over every part of the <b>mounting</b> <b>structure.</b> [...] This modifies the far field antenna pattern typically, but not always, raising the primary lobes above the horizon reducing antenna effectiveness for terrestrial service. [...] J-pole antennas with electrical connection to their supports often fare no better, and often much worse, than the simpler Monopole antenna. [...] A mast decoupling stub reduces mast currents.|$|E
