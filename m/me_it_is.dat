5|$|A {{few months}} ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best {{intentions}} still tell me that's true, but {{the facts and the}} evidence tell <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not. As the Tower board reported, what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages. This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.|$|E

25|$|The Keirsey Temperament Sorter (KTS) is a self-assessed {{personality}} questionnaire {{designed to}} help people better understand themselves and others. It was first introduced in the book Please Understand <b>Me.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the most}} widely used personality assessments in the world, and its user base consists of major employers including Bank of America, Allstate, the U.S. Air Force, IBM, 7-Eleven, Safeco, AT, and Coca-Cola. The KTS is closely associated with the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI); however, there are significant practical and theoretical differences between the two personality questionnaires and their associated different descriptions.|$|E
60|$|Having crossed {{court and}} garden, {{we reached the}} glass door of the first classe. It stood open, like all other doors that night; we passed, and then I was ushered into a small cabinet, {{dividing}} the first classe from the grand salle. This cabinet dazzled <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> so full of light: <b>it</b> deafened <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> clamorous with voices: <b>it</b> stifled <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> so hot, choking, thronged.|$|R

25|$|The {{animal is}} said to be of a brownish-gray color with a smooth skin, its size is {{approximately}} that of an elephant; at least that of a hippopotamus. It {{is said to}} have a long and very flexible neck and only one tooth but a very long one; some say it is a horn. A few spoke about a long, muscular tail like that of an alligator. Canoes coming near it are said to be doomed; the animal is said to attack the vessels at once and to kill the crews but without eating the bodies. The creature is said to live in the caves that have been washed out by the river in the clay of its shores at sharp bends. It is said to climb the shores even at daytime in search of food; its diet {{is said to be}} entirely vegetable. This feature disagrees with a possible explanation as a myth. The preferred plant was shown to <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a kind of liana with large white blossoms, with a milky sap and applelike fruits. At the Ssombo River I was shown a path said to have been made by this animal in order to get at its food. The path was fresh and there were plants of the described type nearby. But since there were too many tracks of elephants, hippos, and other large mammals it was impossible to make out a particular spoor with any amount of certainty.|$|E
500|$|Qandil met {{and married}} Egyptian actress Naglaa Fathi in 1992. He was married twice before. Fathi said of Qandil [...] "He is the first man who has fascinated <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> not easy to bewitch me, but he did. I feel like a student when I'm with him: I {{discover}} new qualities in him every day," [...] while Qandil said he felt an [...] "immediate chemical bond" [...] with Fathi.|$|E
500|$|Widney {{attributed}} his longevity {{to living}} simply and keeping busy. At age 94, Widney advocated [...] "no liquor, no tobacco, no drugs. I'm not a fanatic on liquor, but to <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a medicine. I keep {{it around and}} take it when I need it. But {{there is no excuse}} whatever for tobacco or drugs". He recommended at least eight hours sleep each night and short naps throughout the day.|$|E

500|$|... was {{released}} on June 20, 2007, for mobile phones supporting Java <b>ME.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> {{the only game in}} the series to be released as a two-dimensional (2D) side-scroller and released on a non-PlayStation platform. The game's narrative takes place between the events of Ghost of Sparta and God of War II. Kratos is framed for murder, and rampages across Greece seeking the true assassin. Kratos succumbs to bloodlust and kills Ceryx, the son of the god Hermes—an act that alienates him from his fellow gods.|$|E
500|$|Khan {{claimed that}} he was [...] "not surprised" [...] that Taare Zameen Par was not {{included}} in the Academy Award shortlist, and argued, [...] "I don’t make films for awards. I make films for the audience. The audience, for which I have made the film, really loved it and the audiences outside India have also loved it. What I am trying to say is that film has been well loved across the globe and that for <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> extremely heartening and something that I give very high value to." ...|$|E
500|$|On 6 December 2012, Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard {{delivered}} a hoax speech for {{the radio station}} triple J in which she declared [...] "My dear remaining fellow Australians; {{the end of the}} world is coming. Whether the final blow comes from flesh-eating zombies, demonic hell-beasts or from the total triumph of K-Pop, if you know one thing about <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> this - I will always fight for you to the very end." [...] Radio announcer Neil Mitchell described the hoax as [...] "immature" [...] and pondered whether it demeaned her office.|$|E

500|$|On October 6, 2012, Madonna {{performed}} [...] "Everybody" [...] during The MDNA Tour in San Jose {{to celebrate}} the single's 30th anniversary. She said, [...] "Today {{is a very special}} day for <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> the 30th anniversary of the release of my first-ever single. I remember the amazing feeling I had when I heard the song on the radio the first time." [...] Aidin Vaziri from San Francisco Chronicle commented that [...] "Three decades later, the simple synth-pop lift and naive R melody still felt amazing. It was an off-script moment that inadvertently became the highlight of the show." ...|$|E
500|$|Scott motivates {{himself for}} games by {{channeling}} the anger at his father's abandonment. He said, [...] "I am {{always going to}} have anger because of how he did <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> always going to be there. It is not going away. No way at all." [...] While basketball player Michael Jordan was Scott's childhood sports idol, he says Jordan was not the inspiration for his jersey number of 23. Scott chose it as a combination of his older brothers' high school numbers: James wore number 20, and Lee, Jr. wore number 3. Scott said, [...] "They were my father." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 August 1965, the Parliament of Malaysia voted 126–0 {{in favor of a}} {{constitutional}} amendment expelling Singapore from the federation; hours later, the Parliament of Singapore passed the Republic of Singapore Independence Act, establishing the island as an independent and sovereign republic. [...] A tearful Lee Kuan Yew announced in a televised press conference that Singapore had become a sovereign, independent nation. In a widely remembered quote, he stated: [...] "For <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a moment of anguish. All my life, my whole adult life, I have believed in merger and unity of the two territories." [...] The new state became the Republic of Singapore, with Yusof bin Ishak appointed as its first President.|$|E

500|$|According to Asus {{executive}} Benjamin Yeh, {{the idea}} for the Nexus7 was conceived at International CES in Las Vegas in January2012 during a meeting of executives from his company and Google. After agreeing to manufacture the device for Google as the OEM, Asus was tasked with building a tablet that could sell for US$200 and would be [...] "fast, cheap, and good"; according to the concept of the project management triangle, only two of these qualities can be achieved. Asus chairman Jonney Shih said that the software company [...] "ask a lot" [...] and that [...] "our engineers told <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> like torture". Former Android division manager Andy Rubin commented that Asus was the only company capable of designing such a product in four months.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} 2004, Hunt {{signed a}} {{contract}} with the Broncos for an additional two years, with the intention of staying at the club {{for the rest of his}} career. On re-signing, Hunt stated, [...] "I look around and see guys like Webbie and Locky who have been here for their entire careers, and it's something I would like to do. If I can, I want to be a one-club player too. Playing footy is not just about 80 minutes out on the field every week. For <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a career and I want to be happy where I am, satisfied that my game is progressing and that I am learning all the time to be a better player." ...|$|E
500|$|The films {{also contain}} {{elements}} of visual humour: when Jaws is {{dropped into a}} shark pool in The Spy Who Loved <b>Me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> Jaws who bites the shark. The following film, Moonraker, sees Bond in a comic chase scene with a gondola that becomes a hovercraft, a continuation that Bond author Raymond Benson considered [...] "so dumb that one wonders at what age group the film was really aimed." [...] The music and sound effects are also used for comic effect in the films: the laboratory of Hugo Drax is opened by touchtones that play the tune of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, whilst when Bond and Anya are seen walking across the desert in The Spy Who Loved Me, the theme from Lawrence of Arabia is heard.|$|E
50|$|Every Night is {{an album}} by Saturday Looks Good to <b>Me.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} on September 14, 2004 on Polyvinyl.|$|R

60|$|That was {{the first}} sound I had heard from human lips during all this dreadful chase, and full as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> of menace and danger to <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a welcome sound for it broke that awful silence which {{shrouded}} and appalled <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> as though an overt sign that my opponents were men and not ghosts, and that with them I had, at least; {{the chance of a}} man, though but one against many.|$|R
500|$|Uncharacteristically, Rosas {{remained}} passive {{throughout the}} conflict. The Argentine ruler lost heart once {{he realized that}} he had fallen into a trap. Even if he defeated Urquiza, his forces would probably be weakened enough to prevent him from challenging the Brazilian army that was ready to invade Argentina. With no other alternative, Rosas remarked: [...] "There is no other way; we have to play for the high stakes and go for everything. Here we are, and from here there is no retreat." [...] After an unsuccessful battle against Urquiza on 3 February 1852, Rosas fled to Buenos Aires. Once there, he disguised himself and boarded a ship that took him to Britain to live in exile. Embittered, he remarked: [...] "It is not the people who have overthrown <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> the monkeys, the Brazilians." ...|$|E
500|$|He then {{signed up}} to face Leeds's Johanneson on 19 October 2007 at the Doncaster Dome, Doncaster, England for the British super featherweight title. Johanneson had just come off his second defeat to Armenian Leva Kirakosyan, whom Gomez had knocked out in October 2004. Before the fight, Gomez was confident, stating [...] "You can't outbox me. I'll jab your head off. If he comes to have a fight with <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> going to be early Christmas for {{everyone}} because I don't know who's going to go but someone's {{going to go and}} it's not going to be me." [...] At the pre-fight press conference in Doncaster both fighters squared up to each other and promised to knock each other out; during the highly charged face off both fighters had to be kept apart by their promoter and trainers.|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Rollins {{admitted}} a {{disdain for}} rehashing old {{music for the}} sake of it - [...] "I don’t want to play old music. To <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> fighting battles that are already over and calling yourself a warrior. For me, I see no courage or adventure in doing the old thing over again. If others want to, that’s for them. For myself, I have to move on. Life is too short to live in the past. There is a lot to be done." [...] On the same topic, Henry more recently said in 2016 [...] "For me, music was a time and a place. I never really enjoyed being in a band. It was in me and it needed to come out, like a 25-year exorcism. One day, I woke up, and I didn’t have any more lyrics. I just had nothing to contribute to the form, and I was done with band practice and travelling in groups." ...|$|E
