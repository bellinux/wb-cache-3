40|$|Equity {{flows to}} {{developing}} countries have increased sharply in recent years. Foreign equity investment can be beneficial {{to developing countries}} because of its risk-sharing characteristics and effects on resource mobilization and allocation. Empirical evidence shows that the stock markets of developing countries have become more, although not fully, integrated with world financial markets, and this increased integration implies a lower risk-adjusted cost of capital. Constraints to further increasing the flows and expanding the benefits are <b>macroinstability,</b> poorly functioning stock markets, and insufficiently open financial markets. Empirical evidence {{does not support the}} view that equity flows are more volatile than other types of capital flows or that equity flows {{have a negative impact on}} the volatility of stock prices. World financial markets in recent years have been characterized by trends to-ward increased integration, securitization, and liberalization. Financial markets today show a much higher degree of integration, with large amounts of capital flowing across borders to take advantage of the slightest perceived financial or diversification benefit. Gross capital flows among industrial countries are als...|$|E
40|$|Twelve {{years into}} the {{implementation}} of the Local Government Code of 1991, it is but opportune to assess how the key features of this landmark legislation has contributed to (or detracted from) achieving the balance between local autonomy and accountability. The literature on fiscal decentralization suggests that these two goals are not incompatible. In fact, real autonomy (in the sense of subnational governments being able to link their spending decisions with their revenue/tax decisions) promotes fiscal responsibility. In the context of the ongoing debate in the Philippines, however, local autonomy has been equated (by many LGUs officials) with the independence of LGUs from central government interference. As such, LGU officials have focused more on securing even higher levels of block grants in order to address the widely perceived vertical fiscal imbalance. However, closer scrutiny of the problem indicates that greater tax decentralization coupled with a well designed intergovernmental transfer system that includes elements of fiscal equalization and categorical grants conditional on the achievement of minimum service standards would better enhance the gains that are forthcoming from the decentralization process while minimizing the risks of <b>macroinstability.</b> fiscal decentralization, fiscal autonomy, fiscal accountability, tax assignment, expenditure assignment, vertical balance, horizontal balance, block grants, categorical grants, equalization grants...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the primary {{circulation}} of an agitated liquid in a flat-bottomed cylindrical stirred tank. The study is based on experiments, {{and the results of}} the experiments are followed by a theoretical evaluation. The vessel was equipped with four radial baffles and was stirred with a six pitched blade impeller pumping downwards. The experiments were concentrated on {{the lower part of the}} vessel, where the space pulsations of the primary loop, originated due to the pumping action of the impeller. This area is considered to be the birthplace of the flow macroinstabilities in the system – a phenomenon which has been studied and described by several authors. The flow was observed in a vertical plane passing through the axis of the vessel. The flow patterns of the agitated liquid were visualized by means of Al micro particles illuminated by a vertical light knife and scanned by a digital camera. The experimental conditions corresponded to the turbulent regime of agitated liquid flow. It was found that the primary circulation loop is elliptical in shape. The main diameter of the primary loop is not constant. It increases in time and after reaching a certain value the loop disintegrates and collapses. This process is characterized by a certain periodicity and its period proved to be correlated to the occurrence of flow <b>macroinstability.</b> The instability of the loop can be explained by a dissipated energy balance.   When the primary loop reaches the level of disintegration, the whole impeller power output is dissipated and under this condition any flow alteration requiring additional energy, even a very small vortex separation, causes the loop to collapse. ...|$|E
40|$|Flow {{instability}} {{phenomena in}} stirred vessels were studied with laser anemometry and flow visualization. The effects of fluid density and viscosity, impeller Reynolds number (Re), impeller design, diameter, and off-bottom clearance were investigated {{in order to}} quantify the frequencies (f) of the <b>macroinstabilities</b> stemming from precessional motions. The instabilities are characterized by two frequencies, one present at low Re, and another at high Re values. For intermediate Re values, both frequencies were present. In all cases, f was proportional to the impeller speed (N). The parameter f′ = f/N was shown to be linearly related to the impeller diameter in the low Re range; f′ was not affected by impeller clearance. At constant Re, a change in fluid density and viscosity did not affect f′. The energy contained in the instability frequencies was shown to vary across the vessel. The implications of the results mixing practice are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} {{numerical}} simulation demonstrating that a macromagnetohydrodynamic (macro-MHD) mode is excited {{as a result of}} multi-scale interaction in a quasi-steady equilibrium formed by a balance between microturbulence and zonal flow based on a reduced two-fluid model. This simulation of a macro-MHD mode, a double tearing mode, is accomplished in a reversed shear equilibrium that includes zonal flow and turbulence due to kinetic ballooning modes. In the quasi-steady equilibrium, a macroscale fluctuation that has the same helicity as the double tearing mode {{is a part of the}} turbulence. After a certain period of time, the macro-MHD mode begins to grow. It effectively utilizes free energy of the equilibrium current density gradient and is destabilized by a positive feedback loop between zonal flow suppression and magnetic island growth. Thus, once the macro-MHD appears from the quasi-equilibrium, it continues to grow steadily. This simulation is more comparable with experimental observations of growing macro-MHD activity than earlier MHD simulations starting from linear <b>macroinstabilities</b> in a static equilibrium...|$|R

Changes resulting from the publishing process, such as peer review, editing, corrections, structural formatting, and other quality control mechanisms may not be reflected in this document. Changes may {{have been made to}} this work since it was submitted for publication. A definitive version was subsequently published at: [URL] and high-speed particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques have been employed to study the flow field induced by a sawtooth (EkatoMizer) impeller, operated in the fully turbulent flow regime at an impeller speed of 1500 rpm. Ensemble-averaged mean flow fields and turbulence quantities were calculated for a region close to the impeller blades. The flow was found to be anisotropic near the impeller and exhibited return-to-isotropy behaviour further away from it. <b>Macroinstabilities</b> were found to have a high probability of occurrence in the discharge stream. All three velocity components from the stereo-PIV measurements were used to estimate the dissipation rate, by adopting a large eddy simulation (LES) analogy. Spurious vectors distorting the dissipation rate calculation were identified, and various standard deviation filters were applied for vector validation. By evaluating the filtered dissipation rate profiles against the multi-fractal intermittency model of Meneveau and Sreenivasan (1991), the global standard deviation filter was found to be the most suitable type. The ratio of the maximum to the mean dissipation rate for the EkatoMizer discharge stream was found to be similar to that reported for Rushton disk turbine and pitched-blade turbine impellers in the literature, raising questions about the reported high-shear advantage of sawtooth impellers...|$|R
