Another fire-cured tobacco is Latakia, which is produced from oriental varieties of N. tabacum.

In June 2010, the Food and Drug Administration passed new regulations preventing sponsorship for cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products in any sporting event, including auto racing events. The announcement affected two teams: the No. 33 Truck of Ron Hornaday, Jr. and Kevin Harvick, Inc. lost its Longhorn <b>Moist</b> <b>Snuff</b> sponsorship, while the No. 27 Nationwide Series car of Baker Curb Racing lost its Red Man sponsorship.

40|$|BACKGROUND: It is {{not known}} whether <b>snuff</b> (<b>moist</b> {{smokeless}} tobacco) affects disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to study the effect of snuff on disease activity and function in Swedish patients with early RA.

Disease Activity Score 28 joints (DAS 28), Health Assessment Questionnaire, visual analog scale for general health, and drug treatment were registered at inclusion and at follow-up after 1, 2, and 5 years. European League Against Rheumatism response and remission criteria were applied at 1 year. In 2010, a self-completed postal questionnaire was sent to 2102 patients in the BARFOT study enquiring about lifestyle factors such as smoking and use of snuff. Three controls for each patient using snuff were identified. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients who used snuff were identified, together with 145 controls. When we adjusted for socioeconomic class, disease duration, and previous antirheumatic medication, the snuff users had lower DAS 28 values at up to 6 months of follow-up than patients who had never smoked, and they had lower DAS 28 values than previous smokers at up to 2 years of follow-up. No effect of snuff use on European League Against Rheumatism response was seen at up to 1 year.

(It {{should also be noted that}} the term smokeless tobacco itself is a broad one which, while generally referring to all tobacco products which do not require smoking (e.g. nasal snuff, chewing tobacco, snus, etc.), is popularly used to refer specifically to dipping tobacco.)

40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} of smoking in Sweden has decreased in recent decades, {{and is now}} among {{the lowest in the}} world. During the same period, the use of Swedish <b>moist</b> oral <b>snuff,</b> a smokeless tobacco called snus, has increased. Few studies have evaluated time trends of the socioeconomic and geographic characteristics of snus users in Sweden. This paper contributes to filling that gap. Methods This study utilized the Linnaeus Database, which links national registers with comprehensive individual data on socioeconomic status (SES) to health data from a large ongoing health survey, the Västerbotten Intervention Programme (VIP). The VIP targets the entire middle-aged population of Västerbotten county at ages 40, 50 and 60 years with yearly cross-sectional surveys including self-reported data on tobacco habits. Time trends of snus use among 92, 563 VIP-participants across different areas of residence and smoking groups were investigated graphically. Logistic regression was performed to estimate the associations between SES and geographical variables and current use versus non-use of snus. Results Overall, in parallel to decreasing smoking, the increasing trend of snus use in this middle-aged population continues, particularly in 40 -year-olds. In both genders, the highest {{prevalence of}} snus use was observed among previous smokers. The prevalence of snus use also increased over time among smokers, and was consistently higher compared to those who had never smoked. Among males - both those who had never smoked and previous smokers - low education (OR 1. 21, 95 %CI 1. 06 - 1. 40 and OR 1. 28, 95 %CI 1. 14 - 1. 43), living alone (OR 1. 16, 95 %CI 1. 07 - 1. 27 and OR 1. 13, 95 %ci 1. 04 - 1. 23), low income and living in rural areas was associated with using snus, while this was not seen among male current smokers. Among women, living alone was associated with using snus irrespective of smoking habits. Among female smokers, the OR for snus use increased with higher education. Conclusions A disadvantaged social profile and also higher prevalence in rural areas is observed among male snus users who had never smoked or were previous smokers. Among male smokers there was no association between SES and use of snus. The prevalence of snus use among women is increasing, but is still considerably lower than that of men. The association between snus and SES characteristics is less pronounced among women, although snus is clearly linked to living alone. These patterns should be taken into consideration in tobacco control policies. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{cardiovascular}} {{risk for}} users {{of use of}} Swedish snus/American <b>snuff</b> (<b>moist</b> tobacco) has been debated for a long time. The present {{study was designed to}} examine the effects of water- or lipid-soluble (DMSO-soluble) snus and nicotine, the most important substance in tobacco, on the expression of vasocontractile G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR), such as endothelin ETB, serotonin 5 -HT 1 B, and thromboxane A 2 TP receptors, in rat cerebral arteries. Studies show that these vasocontractile GPCR show alterations by lipid-soluble cigarette smoke particles via activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). However, the effects of moist tobacco on the expression of GPCR are less studied. Rat middle cerebral arteries were isolated and organ cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h in the presence of water-soluble snus (WSS), DMSO-soluble snus (DSS), or nicotine. The dose of snus and nicotine was kept at plasma level of snus users (25 ng nicotine/ml). A high dose (250 ng nicotine/ml) was also included due to the previous results showing alteration in the GPCR expression by nicotine at this concentration. Contractile responses to the ETB receptor agonist sarafotoxin 6 c, 5 -HT 1 B receptor agonist 5 -carboxamidotryptamine, and TP receptor agonist U 46619 were investigated by a sensitive myograph. The expression of ETB, 5 -HT 1 B, and TP receptors was studied at mRNA and protein levels using quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Organ culture with WSS or DSS (25 ng nicotine/ml) lowered the 5 -HT 1 B receptor-mediated contraction. Furthermore, DSS shifted the TP receptor-mediated contraction curve left-wards with a stronger contraction. High dose of nicotine (250 ng nicotine/ml) increased the ETB receptor-mediated contraction. The combined 5 -HT 1 B and 5 -HT 2 A receptor-mediated contraction was increased, and both the 5 -CT and TxA 2 induced contractions were left-ward shifted by WSS, DSS, or nicotine (250 ng nicotine/ml). Only the DSS group showed that the increase of 5 -HT 1 B receptor-mediated contraction occurred at the transcriptional level, demonstrated by an increased mRNA expression for the receptor. Thus, snus and nicotine alter the GPCR expression in the cerebral arteries, which may be involved in cerebral vascular disease...|$|R
