5|$|Robin Hood Gate {{takes its}} name from the nearby Robin Hood Inn (demolished in 2001) and is close to what is called the Robin Hood {{roundabout}} on the A3. Widened in 1907, it has been closed to <b>motorised</b> <b>vehicles</b> since a 2003 traffic reduction trial. Alterations commenced in March 2013 to make the gates more suitable for pedestrian use and return some of the hard surface to parkland.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to a fire station, the building housed a police station, an ambulance station, a bank, a coroner's court, and a gas-meter testing station. The fire station operated for eighty years, housing the firemen, their families, and the horse-drawn appliances that were replaced by <b>motorised</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{a few years after}} its opening. It was visited by royalty in 1942, in recognition of the brigade's wartime efforts. After the war it became a training centre and in 1952 became the first centre equipped to record emergency calls. However, the fire station became expensive to maintain and after council reorganisation decline set in.|$|E
5|$|The {{relatively}} mild, temperate marine climate, {{allows for}} outdoor recreation year round, including walking, hiking, cycling and outdoor team sports. Mountain biking is usually restricted to marked routes. Watersports like sailing, kayaking, motor boating, etc. are also popular, {{and since the}} bay rarely freezes up in winter, {{they can also be}} practised most of the year. Recreational and transportational pathways for pedestrians and cyclists, radiate from the city centre to the countryside, providing safety from <b>motorised</b> <b>vehicles</b> and a more tranquil experience. This includes the 30 kilometre long pathway of Brabrandstien, encircling the Brabrand Lake. The long-range hiking route Aarhus-Silkeborg, starts off from Brabrandstien.|$|E

25|$|A {{structured}} {{road network}} {{had been developed}} in the early 19th century {{as a part of}} the Java Great Post Road by former Governor-General Daendels, which connects most major cities throughout Java. During the following decades, the road network was expanded to a great extent, although it could not keep up with the rapidly increasing numbers of <b>motorised</b> <b>vehicles,</b> resulting in highly congested traffic.|$|E
25|$|Articulated lorries or {{semi-trailers}} feature two number plates {{placed at}} the rear of the trailer. One is designated for the tractor unit, and another for the trailer it pulls. The tractor unit's license number follows standard conventions for <b>motorised</b> <b>vehicles,</b> while the trailer's own number plate uses a T/Sx #### format, with the T/ prefix is a constant for all Malaysian trailers. Both plates have white characters on a black background.|$|E
25|$|Traffic {{problems}} in Malaysia {{began in the}} late 1920s when <b>motorised</b> <b>vehicles</b> began to hover on the road that used to be covered only by bicycle, tricycle, rickshaw and bullock carts. This situation creates a new task for the police forces, which is to maintain and control the traffic. In 1928 and 1929, the traffic branch was established in big cities, which is Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh and Seremban. Singapore, which at that time was part of Strait States have set up traffic branch earlier, which is in 1918. In other cities, the task of controlling the traffic falls on regular general duty policemen.|$|E

25|$|The current {{standard}} for Malaysian number plates were originally derivatives of pre-1932 number plate formats in the United Kingdom, first issued after {{the introduction of}} <b>motorised</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the 1900s during British rule. Number plates are typically issued and are formatted similarly for any motorised vehicle that runs on rubber tyres, including most road-legal private, commercial and industrial vehicles, motorcycles, emergency vehicles, and selected heavy equipment (such as agricultural tractors, truck-mounted cranes and backhoe loaders). With the exception of those issued for taxis, vehicle dealers and diplomats, all vehicle number plates in Malaysia have white characters on black background for both front and rear plates, regardless of the vehicle type.|$|E
500|$|The Welsh Pony {{has been}} put to many uses. Historically, they were used for postal routes and in coal mines. The British War Office used the Welsh Cob to pull heavy guns and {{equipment}} through terrain where <b>motorised</b> <b>vehicles</b> could not, and also used them for mounted infantry. Today, they are used as riding and driving ponies for both children and adults. Welshes today are also used in dressage, endurance riding, general riding, hunting, jumping, and work activities. They have proven their ability at driving in Fédération Équestre Internationale (FEI) level competition, and {{have been used for}} dressage. They also compete against one another in breed show competition as hunters, eventers, and western pleasure horses. The abilities of the Welsh Pony were showcased in 2008 when the first champion Large Pony Hunter to be made into a model Breyer horse was a grey Welsh Pony gelding.|$|E

2500|$|An old route, {{marked on}} maps as [...] "Old Coach Road" [...] crosses the {{northern}} slopes of Threlkeld Knotts and skirts {{the eastern side}} of Clough Head, reaching a height of 437m as it crosses from Wanthwaite (...) in St John's in the Vale to High Row near Dockray. This has suffered from rain water erosion in recent years, but remains a useful track for walkers. Near the summit of the road is Hause Well, a spring issuing from a crevice in the rock. The Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 map shows the road as an [...] "other route with public access" [...] and as a [...] "traffic-free cycle route;" [...] it does not show it as either a [...] "byway" [...] or a [...] "restricted byway". However, official signs present on the gates {{at both ends of the}} road clearly show that access by <b>motorised</b> <b>vehicles</b> is permitted.|$|E
2500|$|Although law-tracts in Early Medieval Ireland {{described}} {{several different}} types of road, and Irish annals referred to a network of major highways, {{there is no evidence}} to suggest that Ireland ever had a network of roads as well developed as those found in the Roman Empire or other ancient societies. The road network remained underdeveloped throughout the Late Medieval and much of the Early Modern periods: it was not until the 18th century that an extensive system of roads suitable for long-distance travel was developed. Newly built roads were relatively wide and straight. Many still form the backbone of the current major roads network. The development of roads continued throughout the early 19th century until the arrival of the railways which became the dominant form of land transport from the 1840s-1850s onwards. The development of the internal combustion engine and of <b>motorised</b> <b>vehicles</b> led to [...] increases in traffic on roads, which were developed and improved as a result. Ireland's roads have continued to develop and improve up to the present day. Various development programmes have successively increased the number of motorways and dual carriageways within the national roads network while other roads have had their surfaces and signposting improved.|$|E
