40|$|This {{research}} aims to {{test and}} analyze the effect of stock liquidity on stock mispricing which listed at Indonesia Stock Exchange. The applied sampling method is purposive sampling. The sample in this research is banking firms registered during January 2010 up to December 2013. The analysis method applied to analyze the influence stock liquidity on stock mispricing is descriptive analysis. Stock liquidity uses three measure: amihud illiquidity, amihud risk and share turnover. This research uses multiple regression and panel data with 22 banking companies listed which based on criteria of research at Indonesia Stock Exchange as a sample. The result of this research shows during Januari 2010 – December 2013 that size and book to market ratio have negative effects and not significantly influence on banking 2 ̆ 7 s stock <b>mispricing</b> <b>in</b> Indonesia. Stock liquidity measured by amihud illiquidity shows that liquidity has positive and significantly influence banking 2 ̆ 7 s stock <b>mispricing</b> <b>in</b> Indonesia.

40|$|Using a large {{panel of}} Australian firms, we {{investigate}} if <b>mispricing</b> <b>in</b> {{the stock market}} has an impact on firm-level investment. A significantly positive relation is documented between investment and theproxies for mispricing, suggesting that overpriced (underpriced) firms tend to overinvest (underinvest). Furthermore, we find that equity-dependent firms display a more pronounced sensitivity of investment to stock misvaluation than do nonequity-dependent firms. Taken together, our findings evidence that <b>mispricing</b> <b>in</b> Australian capital markets may have significant influence on the real economy, and the influence works though an equity-financing channel. © 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|I analyse {{a series}} of natural quasi-experiments - centred on betting {{exchange}} data on the Wimbledon Tennis Championships - to determine whether information processing constraints are partially responsible for <b>mispricing</b> <b>in</b> asset markets. I find that the arrival of information during each match leads to substantial mispricing between two equivalent assets, and that part of this mispricing {{can be attributed to}} differences in the frequency with which the two prices are updated inplay. This suggests that information processing constraints force the periodic neglect of one of the assets, thereby causing substantial, albeit temporary, <b>mispricing</b> <b>in</b> this simple asset market. © 2013 Royal Economic Society...|$|R
40|$|<b>In</b> this dissertation, <b>mispricing</b> <b>in</b> the UK {{stock market}} is investigated. It is well {{documented}} that stock mispricing has been discovered in stock markets in the world. This paper first reviews the mispricing evidences, the models valuing stocks, and hypotheses explaining mispricing established by previous researchers. Then, a sample test is conducted to analyse the stock <b>mispricing</b> <b>in</b> UK stock market. A large panel of UK firms listed on London Stock Exchange {{has been used to}} accomplish the empirical examination. According to results of portfolio classification analysis and regressions, it is found that 1) firm characteristics measured by book-to-market ratio and firm size have a significantly negative/positive impact on mispricing of stock; 2) there‘s significantly positive relationship between the stock mispricing and the inflation; 3) stocks with high mispricing underperform stocks with low mispricing; 4) arbitrage opportunities and stock mispricing are positively related...|$|R
40|$|The {{central bank}} {{acts as a}} social planner, and adjusts the real risk-free rate of return to correct any <b>mispricing</b> <b>in</b> the stock market so that the {{emergence}} of positive or negative bubbles is avoided. The flip side {{is that if the}} real risk-free rate is fixed, it incorporates inefficiency into the financial market. Setting a zero bound for the risk-free rate constrains the adjustment in the case of negative bubbles, and the fixed negative risk-free rate in the market not only prevents the adjustment of possible positive bubbles but may also lead to rampant instability in the market. The paper also points out the limits of manageable control of <b>mispricing.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the analysis indicates that the central bank should intervene in the stock market even if it does not have perfect information about the bubble...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether {{deviations from}} a domestic spot-futures relation, as identified through <b>mispricing</b> series <b>in</b> stock index futures, spillover international boundaries. Such spillovers suggest that {{information from a}} <b>mispricing</b> series <b>in</b> one market conveys a signal of similar <b>mispricing</b> <b>in</b> another market. In the presence of arbitrage traders {{and in the absence}} of market frictions, mispricing series should be independent across international boundaries. The study employs a VAR analysis of stock index futures mispricing across three large futures markets - Australia, the UK and the USA. Using time zone differences, tests are conducted for the daily transmission of arbitrage information. The results reveal the relationship between mispricing series is bi-directional. Based on this finding, a trading strategy is employed to examine the economic significance of apparent profits. The results show that some profits are possible after transaction costs but that a long horizon, probably beyond the scope of most traders, is required to exploit the spillover information.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{attempts}} to analyse whether forward exchange arbitrage in currencies of managed rate regimes behave differently from currencies of free floating {{regimes in the}} forward exchange market. For this purpose, currencies of Great Britain, the European Union, and Japan are used as proxy currencies for free floating currencies. Proxy currencies for managed rate currencies are the Sri Lankan Rupee, the Indian Rupee, the Russian Rouble and the Brazilian Real. The US dollar is used as the anchor currency for both sets of currencies. The core of the paper revolves around the pricing difference between the fundamental forward price and the market forward price. Fundamental forward price {{is calculated based on}} the interest rate differentials of the two currencies; this is in concurrence with the interest rate parity condition. Market price is based on the forward pips and the spot rate. This analysis concentrates on the persistence of mispricing availability, the availability of forward pricing differences and the predictability of the <b>mispricing</b> <b>in</b> both sets of currencies. Finally, we also test whether the current forward price can predict the future spot price based on the interest rate parity theory. We present evidence that almost all the currencies have forward rate mispricing. However, we also present evidence to prove that <b>mispricing</b> <b>in</b> free floating currencies is extremely small, while managed rate currencies offer significant mispricing that could be exploited for arbitrage purposes. We also present evidence to establish that persistence of mispricing is specific to the currency pair and cannot be clearly attributed to the exchange rate regime. This paper also finds that {{it is not possible to}} statistically forecast the <b>mispricing</b> <b>in</b> both free floating and managed rate currencies. Further, failure of interest rate parity theory to accurately forecast the future spot rate is also documented...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} partial {{equilibrium}} portfolio optimization {{problem for a}} myopic CRRA investor who can trade options on individual stocks. Applying the parametric portfolio approach of Brandt, Santa-Clara, and Valkanov (forthcoming) to derivatives we show that options characteristics (such as implied volatility and IV smile skew) convey information about the <b>mispricing</b> <b>in</b> the option portfolios. We take the data on all US-traded options to build characteristic-based factor portfolios of options. An investor uses them {{in addition to the}} market portfolio and Fama and French (1992) factors in her utility maximization. Surprisingly, portfolios based on the IV smile skew turn out to be less important than IV-based portfolios, and factor portfolios from call options are in general more interesting for an investor than the factors from puts. Market frictions in the form of stock shortsale constraints are compensated by the use of options, and having options with no stock shortsales allowed may even be better than having only stocks with shortsales permitted. Monthly rebalancing leads to extreme transaction costs for an investor facing the full bid-ask spread, providing a limits to arbitrage interpretation of the documented <b>mispricing</b> <b>in</b> the option portfolios...|$|R

40|$|In {{traditional}} models, arbitrage {{in a given}} {{security is}} performed by {{a large number of}} diversified investors taking small positions against its <b>mispricing.</b> <b>In</b> reality, however, arbitrage is conducted by {{a relatively small number of}} highly specialized investors who take large positions using other people's money. Such professional arbitrage has a number of interesting implications for security pricing, including the possibility that arbitrage becomes ineffective in extreme circumstances, when prices diverge far from fundamental values. The model also suggests where anomalies in financial markets are likely to appear, and why arbitrage fails to eliminate them. ...|$|R

We find that a zero-cost trading strategy that is long (short) in 2 -month-to-expiry calls with relatively large positive (negative) difference between historical realized volatility and option implied volatility produces significant positive returns, but the same strategy applied to 1 -month-to-expiry calls and delta-hedged calls does not...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a methodology for testing the term structure of volatility forecasts derived from stochastic volatility models, and implements it to analyze models of S&P 500 index volatility.

The most successful volatility hedge is GARCH components delta-gamma, suggesting that the GARCH components estimate of the term structure of volatility is most accurate.

50|$|The {{example of}} LTCM {{is a good}} {{illustration}} of why arbitrage by financial institutions has not succeeded <b>in</b> eliminating the <b>mispricing</b> <b>in</b> DLCs. An important characteristic of DLC arbitrage is that the underlying shares are not convertible into each other. Hence, risky arbitrage positions must be kept open until prices converge. Since there is no identifiable date at which DLC prices will converge, arbitrageurs with limited horizons {{who are unable to}} close the price gap on their own face considerable uncertainty. De Jong, Rosenthal, and van Dijk (2008) simulate arbitrage strategies in twelve DLCs over the period 1980-2002. They show that in some cases, arbitrageurs would have to wait for almost nine years before prices have converged and the position can be closed. In the short run, the <b>mispricing</b> might deepen. <b>In</b> these situations, arbitrageurs receive margin calls, after which they would most likely be forced to liquidate part of the position at a highly unfavorable moment and suffer a loss. As a result, arbitrage strategies in DLCs are very risky, which is likely to impede arbitrage.|$|R

Contrary to other studies we show explicitly that for high-frequency data, this predictability is due not to microstructure effects but to arbitrage activity. Using a threshold autoregressive model that is consistent with arbitrage behavior, we show that such models imply first-order autocorrelation <b>in</b> <b>mispricing</b> changes similar <b>in</b> magnitude to that actually observed. For low-frequency data, we show that predictability is driven neither by arbitrage activity nor by microstructure effects. Rather, it is a statistical illusion that is the result of overdifferencing a trend-stationary series. ...|$|R

The magnitude of the mispricing and the absence of arbitrage make behavioral effects more visible and provide a unique opportunity to examine extant behavioral hypotheses. Results confirm effects such as disposition and/or conservatism with the mispricing negatively related to past returns, but unrelated to future returns. Finally, an orderly weakening of the negative relation to past returns and behavioral effects is observed, suggesting that such effects will diminish as the market matures...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the pricing of futures {{contracts}} relative to expected future spot prices in the Nordic electricity market. Data set of 1 – 6 weeks ahead weekly and 1 – 6 months ahead monthly futures is used to identify whether futures premium is present in the Nordic market. The findings reveal that short term futures contracts are unbiased predictors of the future spot prices. However, at longer maturities (5 – 6 weeks for weekly contracts and 2 – 6 months for monthly ones) significant time-varying futures premium exists. This premium is positive on average and doesn’t vary significantly by seasons. Furthermore, the magnitude of the premium is found to be substantially higher than in other commodity markets. Finally, a link between the futures premium and measures of risk (reservoir level, variance and skewness of the spot prices) is tested to find out whether the premium exists as a compensation for risk or <b>mispricing</b> <b>in</b> the market. The futures premium is found to be positively related to the reservoir level, while relationship with variance and skewness of the spot prices is mostly insignificant. As the magnitude of the premium is too high to be explained by this sole risk factor, it is concluded that <b>mispricing</b> exists <b>in</b> futures contracts with maturities longer than 4 weeks in the Nordic electricity market...|$|R
