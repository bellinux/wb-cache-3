2500|$|In 1993 Minnesota {{passed a}} {{provision}} that added sexual orientation to the state's human rights law. The provision has been characterized by its supporters as protecting “gay and lesbian teachers and students from discrimination”. In early 2003 Rep. Lindner claimed that the provision was a shield {{for the promotion of}} [...] homosexuality, “In some of the schools, we've got children as young as three, in pre-school, on up through the years that are being taught homosexual practices. And it doesn't mean they're going to be homosexual, but unfortunately they hear about some of the sexual activities of the homosexual, and they're being told that it's safe and so forth and healthy, and it isn't.” He claimed “parents have complained to the schools, and administrators have told them that there's nothing they can do because of state law.” Lindner co-authored a bill to repeal this provision and worked to get it a hearing by a House committee. Meeting with homosexuals opposed to his bill Lindner stressed “I don't hate any of those people. I know they accuse me of hating and wanting all kind of terrible things to happen to them, but I don't hate any of them. I do love them. Actually this would benefit them if they were to leave that lifestyle or if they would maybe be more faithful to one partner, if it's got to be that way. But it's <b>my</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>that</b> gays have hundreds and even thousands of partners over a lifetime.” His remarks were seen as offensive by many Minnesotan homosexuals who said “most gays and lesbians are in committed relationships.” [...] They also took issue with Lindner's suggestion that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice.|$|E

I had likewise learned, from his example, an utter detestation of all falsehood or disguise; and truth appeared so amiable to me, that I determined upon sacrificing every thing to it.|$|E

5000|$|In {{a review}} of Jerzy Kosiński: A Biography by James Park Sloan, D. G.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the term 'context' and the aim has been to reason about the term {{in order to see}} whether it is {{possible}} to reach a satisfactory understanding of the concept. But the thesis is also a journey into human reasoning and conveys a certain view of human cognition. It aims to synthesise results of studies within psychology, cognitive science, anthropology, and human-computer interaction. <b>My</b> <b>understanding</b> is <b>that</b> context is not something we are a part of, but rather something we create mentally in relation a specific goal. Determination of something ambiguous thus comes from top-down processes related to a goal. I believe context has been wrongly interpreted in HCI as that which a user is situated in and which a product is being used in.

50|$|We {{now come}} to the Kalyar, a tribe {{generally}} seen as of Jat status. Just {{as a point of}} clarification, <b>my</b> <b>understanding</b> is <b>that</b> Kalyar have no connection whatsoever with the Kalyals, who have been referred in my earlier post. According to their traditions, the tribe claims descent from a Bhatti Rajput nobleman, a Rana Rajwadhan. The Rana lived in Ghazni, and then moved to Delhi in India. After sometime, he moved to Bhatner. In the 13th Century, the Rana moved to Chanb Kalyar, in what is now the Lodhran District, in Sindh, Pakistan. The ruler of the area was a Raja Bhutta. The Raja wanted to marry the daughter of Rajwadhan, who refused. As a result a battle took place, and the Raja was slain. The tract was then divided by Rajwadhan, and his five sons, Kalyar, Uttera, Kanju, Noon and Hattar.|$|R
