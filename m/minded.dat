5|$|Critics who {{admire his}} middle work might {{characterize}} it as supple and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist, while others find these poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeats's later work found new imaginative inspiration in the mystical system {{he began to}} work out for himself {{under the influence of}} spiritualism. In many ways, this poetry is a return to the vision of his earlier work. The opposition between the worldly <b>minded</b> man of the sword and the spiritually <b>minded</b> man of God, the theme of The Wanderings of Oisin, is reproduced in A Dialogue Between Self and Soul.|$|E

United themselves were without Paul Scholes due to injury, and they played a 4–3–2–1 formation with Phil Neville, Roy Keane and Quinton Fortune completing a defensively <b>minded</b> midfield.|$|E

To measure theory of <b>mind</b> ability, a new measure of theory <b>mind</b> was administered, self-paced slide shows, which look at implicit theory of <b>mind</b> ability.

This study measured maternal <b>mind</b> mindedness through a phone interview. The interview measured the amount of times a parent mentioned behavioral, mental, and physical qualities of the child. In question was whether mental state qualities mentioned by the mother will relate to implicit and explicit theory of <b>mind</b> ability of their children.

5|$|Champollion, {{a liberal}} and {{progressive}} <b>minded</b> man, {{lived in a}} period of political turmoil in France which continuously threatened to disrupt his research in various ways. During the Napoleonic wars he was able to avoid conscription, but his Napoleonic allegiances meant that he was considered suspect by the subsequent Royalist regime. His own actions, sometimes brash and reckless, did not help his case. His relations with important political and scientific figures of the time, such as Joseph Fourier and Silvestre de Sacy helped him, although in some periods he lived exiled from the scientific community.|$|E

5|$|Although {{she enjoyed}} {{motherhood}} and assumed {{primary responsibility for}} rearing the children, Stanton found herself unsatisfied and even depressed {{by the lack of}} intellectual companionship and stimulation in Seneca Falls. Throughout this period of removal from the woman’s movement, Stanton kept in touch with Susan B. Anthony, and writing Anthony’s speeches became one of Stanton’s primary modes of involvement in the movement from afar. Additionally, Stanton often wrote Anthony letters about the difficulties of balancing domestic and public life, especially in a prejudiced society. As another antidote to the boredom and loneliness, Stanton became increasingly involved in the community and, by 1848, had established ties to similarly <b>minded</b> women in the area. By this time, she was firmly committed to the nascent women's rights movement and was ready to engage in organized activism.|$|E

Rimsky-Korsakov, with Alexander Glazunov, Anatoly Lyadov and several other nationalistically <b>minded</b> composers and musicians, had formed a group known as the Belyayev circle, named after a merchant and amateur musician who became an influential music patron and publisher. Tchaikovsky spent much time in this circle, becoming far more at ease with them than he had been with the 'Five' and increasingly confident in showcasing his music alongside theirs. This relationship lasted until Tchaikovsky's death.|$|E
