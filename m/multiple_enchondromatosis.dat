40|$|Metachondromatosis (MC) is a rare, {{autosomal}} dominant, incompletely penetrant combined exostosis and enchondromatosis tumor syndrome. MC is clinically {{distinct from}} other multiple exostosis or <b>multiple</b> <b>enchondromatosis</b> syndromes and is unlinked to EXT 1 and EXT 2, the genes responsible for autosomal dominant multiple osteochondromas (MO). To identify a gene for MC, we performed linkage analysis with high-density SNP arrays {{in a single}} family, used a targeted array to capture exons and promoter sequences from the linked interval in 16 participants from 11 MC families, and sequenced the captured DNA using high-throughput parallel sequencing technologies. DNA capture and parallel sequencing identified heterozygous putative loss-of-function mutations in PTPN 11 in 4 of the 11 families. Sanger sequence analysis of PTPN 11 coding regions {{in a total of}} 17 MC families identified mutations in 10 of them (5 frameshift, 2 nonsense, and 3 splice-site mutations). Copy number analysis of sequencing reads from a second targeted capture that included the entire PTPN 11 gene identified an additional family with a 15 kb deletion spanning exon 7 of PTPN 11. Microdissected MC lesions from two patients with PTPN 11 mutations demonstrated loss-of-heterozygosity for the wild-type allele. We next sequenced PTPN 11 in DNA samples from 54 patients with the <b>multiple</b> <b>enchondromatosis</b> disorders Ollier disease or Maffucci syndrome, but found no coding sequence PTPN 11 mutations. We conclude that heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in PTPN 11 are a frequent cause of MC, that lesions in patients with MC appear to arise following a "second hit," that MC may be locus heterogeneous since 1 familial and 5 sporadically occurring cases lacked obvious disease-causing PTPN 11 mutations, and that PTPN 11 mutations are not a common cause of Ollier disease or Maffucci syndrome...|$|E

30|$|<b>Multiple</b> <b>enchondromatosis</b> (Ollier’s disease) is {{a common}} intraosseous benign {{cartilaginous}} tumour that develops {{in close proximity to}} the growth plate. It can cause deformity and limb-length discrepancy and carries a risk of malignant change to chondrosarcoma [17]. Conventional treatment is curettage and bone grafting which may result in severe deformities requiring repeated osteotomies. It is often difficult to obtain adequate stabilization and normal bone growth by autogenous bone grafting. Jesus-Garcia et al. [18] reported the use of the Ilizarov method in ten patients with Ollier’s disease. They reported excellent results and claimed the technique led to conversion of the abnormal cartilage to histologically mature bone in all their patients [18]. In this series all cases had accurate deformity correction with stable and mature bony regenerate. Three of the four cases had residual shortening (0.5  cm) that was not significant. One developed a knee contracture that resolved with physiotherapy. In spite of lengthening, which for some cases was over 9  cm and up to 14  cm, all four patients had excellent bony healing illustrated by the low EFI values (12, 23, 37 and 55  days/cm).|$|E

40|$|Fibrous {{dysplasia}} (FD) is a monostotic or polyostotic benign bone lesion with spindle-cell proliferation in woven {{bone and}} stroma. Rarely, cartilaginous differentiation {{can be seen}} in the lesions of FD. FD with massive cartilaginous differentiation is called fibrocartilaginous dysplasia (FCD) and is considered a rare variant of FD. Although pathological findings of FD show irregular immature bone formation without osteoblastic rimming in fibrous tissue, and rarely show very small amounts of cartilage, histological images of FCD are said to show that cartilage with a relatively high cell density is present in the majority and that FD-like findings are seen in parts of it. The most characteristic feature of FCD on images is calcification in the lesions reflecting cartilaginous tissue. On the other hand, typical radiographic findings of FD include shadows with a ground-glass appearance and thinning and bulging of the cortical bone, the observation if calcification is not usual. Therefore, in the diagnosis of FCD, differentiation from <b>multiple</b> <b>enchondromatosis,</b> Ollier disease, chondrosarcoma, and chondrosarcoma secondary to FD is necessary, and it seems important to make a careful diagnosis based not only on the pathological findings but also on imaging and clinical findings.

40|$|Abstract Enchondromas {{are common}} intraosseous, usually benign {{cartilaginous}} tumors, that develop {{in close proximity}} to growth plate cartilage. When multiple enchondromas are present, the condition is called enchondromatosis also known as Ollier disease (WHO terminology). The estimated prevalence of Ollier disease is 1 / 100, 000. Clinical manifestations often appear {{in the first decade of}} life. Ollier disease is characterized by an asymmetric distribution of cartilage lesions and these can be extremely variable (in terms of size, number, location, evolution of enchondromas, age of onset and of diagnosis, requirement for surgery). Clinical problems caused by enchondromas include skeletal deformities, limb-length discrepancy, and the potential risk for malignant change to chondrosarcoma.

40|$|To review Ollier disease, an {{uncommon}} disease, {{in order to}} understand the clinical symptoms, diagnosis, correct treatment, and risk factors in order to prevent malignant transformation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen cases of Ollier disease were treated between 1976 and 2006. The variables studied included: age at diagnosis and onset of malignant transformation, location of the lesion, family association with other tumours, radiological findings, treatment for the different lesions, metastatic lesions and survival. We excluded patients with Chondrosarcoma without previous diagnosis of Ollier disease. All malignant transformations were assessed by histopathology studies and radiological images. RESULTS: We include 16 cases of Ollier's and 1 of Maffucci's syndrome. The median age at diagnosis for patients having malignant transformation was 45 years, whereas the average age at diagnosis for patient without progression to malignancy was 11 years. Pathological fractures, dysmetria and deformities led to the diagnosis in young people. Benign lesions were treated with minor surgery. There were five malignancy transformations in four patients (23. 5 %), with the distal femur being the most frequent location for transformation to grade I chondrosarcoma. Surgery was the treatment in all of them. We found no family association with other tumours. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Multiple</b> <b>enchondromatosis</b> is a benign disease with a high risk of malignant transformation above 40 years old.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Enchondromas are benign tumours {{derived from}} {{cartilaginous}} tissue and they rarely undergo malignant transformation unless they occur in multiple {{sites such as}} in the case of Ollier disease. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report a rare case of a 36 -year-old Chinese female, without any past medical history, who had a right chest wall tumour which was initially diagnosed to be benign, for which she was loss to follow up. The mass had been stable in size for the past 7 years until recently, when it gradually grew bigger. computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax revealed that the mass had invaded the right chest wall suggestive of malignant change. She subsequently underwent an elective open right chest wall resection of the mass and chest wall reconstruction with mesh. A 3  cm by 3  cm tumour arising from the anterior aspect of the 4 th rib was found intra-operatively. Post-operative course was uneventful. Histologically, the mass was confirmed to be chrondrosarcoma and resection margins were negative. The patient was discharged on 4 th post-operative day and her latest CT thorax during follow up 2 years after operation did not show any tumour recurrence. DISCUSSION: The aim of chest wall reconstruction is to avoid instability and prevent thoracic organs from being exposed if the defect size is ≥ 10  cm or at least three ribs are resected. Polypropylene mesh may be relatively weak in terms of mechanical support for the chest wall, however, in this case, the defect is not too large and the laterally reflected pectoral muscle can provide enough support together with the mesh. CONCLUSION: Secondary chondrosarcoma in a young Asian female arising from a benign solitary enchondroma in the absence of <b>multiple</b> <b>enchondromatosis,</b> such as Ollier disease or Maffucci syndrome, is extremely rare. Regular follow up including physical assessment and radiological imaging can result in earlier detection of malignant transformation obviating the need for aggressive surgical treatment involving multiple rib resections...|$|E
