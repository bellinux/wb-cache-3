40|$|Trata-se de um estudo de caso, qualitativo, fundamentado nos pressupostos da Sociologia Compreensiva. O objetivo do estudo é o de compreender a adesão à terapia medicamentosa na perspectiva do portador de transtorno mental e do familiar/cuidador. Os cenários da pesquisa foram um Centro de Referência em Saúde Mental (CERSAM) e três Unidades Básicas de Saúde do município de Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais. Os sujeitos da pesquisa foram treze pacientes com diagnóstico de esquizofrenia e dois familiares que convivem com esquizofrênicos. Os dados foram coletados por meio de entrevistas semiestruturadas, submetidos à análise de conteúdo e organizados em três categorias temáticas envolvendo os seguintes aspectos que influenciam na adesão ao tratamento: 1) Implicações da doença, da família e do trabalho; 2) Experiência do portador de transtorno mental quanto ao uso da medicação; 3) Trajetória de atendimento do portador de transtorno mental. A primeira apontou para certo conhecimento do paciente em relação à esquizofrenia, com restrições na aceitação, atribuindo outros sentidos à doença, como a concepção do nervoso. Percebeu-se o familiar/cuidador também vulnerável ao adoecimento, às vezes pela situação de estresse gerada pelo convívio diário com o paciente. O trabalho é visto como auxiliar no tratamento do esquizofrênico. A segunda abordou a não-adesão ao tratamento, considerando-se a percepção dos efeitos adversos dos medicamentos; a crença de que estão fazendo mal; a melhora dos sintomas; a automedicação; o uso de drogas psicoativas e a busca de terapias alternativas. Todos reconhecem a necessidade do tratamento medicamentoso, que surge como coadjuvante, para o portador de transtorno mental, que revela seu autodomínio como determinante do sucesso ou não de seu tratamento. A terapia medicamentosa configura-se como uma via de mão dupla, pois é percebida pelo paciente como uma possibilidade para sentir-se normal ou entrar em crise. A terceira evidenciou relatos da trajetória de internações nos hospitais psiquiátricos e, posteriormente, experiências positivas nos atendimentos dos serviços substitutivos. O acesso aos medicamentos na rede pública de saúde, no SUS-BH, também foi apontado como um fator de melhora no atendimento, tanto pelo abastecimento regular como pela atenção dispensada pelos profissionais das farmácias das Unidades de Saúde. It is a {{study of}} {{qualitative}} case based in the presuppositions of the Comprehensive Sociology, {{with the objective of}} understand adherence the therapeutical medication in the user's perspective with <b>mental</b> <b>upset</b> and caretaker. The scenery of the research was a reference center in mental health (CERSAM) and three basic units of health of the municipal district of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais. The subject of the research were 13 patient with schizophrenia diagnosis and 2 family that live together with schizophrenic. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews, submitted to the content analysis and organized in three thematic categories involving aspects that influence in the adhesion to the treatment: 1) implications of the disease, family and work; 2) experience of the bearer of <b>mental</b> <b>upset</b> as for the the use of the medication; 3) path of service of the bearer of <b>mental</b> <b>upset.</b> The first appeared for certain knowledge in relation to schizophrenia, with restrictions in the acceptance, attributing other senses to the disease, as the conception of the "nervous". We noticed the caretaker is also vulnerable to the be taken ill. The work is seen as aiding in the treatment. The second, it approached the no-adherence to the treatment, for the perception of the adverse effects of the medicines; the faith that he is doing badly; the improvement of the symptoms; the selfmedication; the use of drugs psicoativas and the search of alternative therapies. All recognize the need of the therapeutical medication, that appears as supporting, for PTM, that reveals his/her self-control as decisive of the success or not of his/her treatment. The therapeutical medication is configured, therefore as a "road of two-way", because it is imposed as possibility to feel "normal" or outbreak. Reports of the path of internments appeared at the psychiatric hospitals and, later the experience in the substitutive services. The access to the medicines in the public net of health, in SUS-BH was also pointed as an improvement factor in the service, so much for the regular provisioning as for the attention released by the professionals of the pharmacies of the units of health...|$|E

Its main objective was to identify {{the meaning of the}} mental disorders for the relatives of the diseases carriers. This study consisted on a qualitative-ethnographic research. The informers who took part on the investigation were 20 disease carriers’ relatives, mostly mothers, from predominant low socioeconomic level. Data were collected through the following instruments: participative observation, semi-structured interviews containing eight opened questions and a field diary. Data were analyzed by means of the content analysis referential. In what concerns the meaning that the relatives attribute to the mental upsets, it was possible to observe that they relate such phenomena to disease, unbalance, suffering and great complication. In respect to the causes they attribute to the disease there were detected biological, psychological and social causes. Concerning companionship, it was observed that it varied from harmonious to blocked. In relation to the supposed consequences and marks of that conviviality, there were configured the following categories: trauma, disharmony, frustration and stress. When asked about handlings and feelings in face of the presented crises, it was observed that they demonstrate anguish as well as patience. After this research, it was possible to conclude that a <b>mental</b> <b>upset</b> is still a not understood phenomenon, difficult to deal with, filled with preconceptions and stigmas by the disease carrier’s relatives...|$|E
