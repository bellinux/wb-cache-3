25|$|Although FDA-approved for {{contraceptive}} use, Searle never marketed Enovid 10mg as a contraceptive. Eight months later, on February 15, 1961, the FDA approved Enovid 5mg for contraceptive use.

25|$|NET was {{synthesized}} for {{the first}} time by chemists Luis Miramontes, Carl Djerassi, and George Rosenkranz at Syntex in Mexico City in 1951. It was the first highly active oral progestogen to be synthesized, and was preceded (as a progestogen) by progesterone (1934), ethisterone (1938), 19-norprogesterone (1944), and 17α-methylprogesterone (1949), as well as by nandrolone (1950), whereas noretynodrel (1952), and norethandrolone (1953) followed the synthesis of NET. The drug was first introduced, alone as Norlutin, in the United States in 1957. NET was subsequently introduced in combination with <b>mestranol</b> as Ortho-Novum in the U.S. in 1963, and was the second progestin, after noretynodrel in 1960, to be used in an oral contraceptive. In 1964, additional contraceptive preparations containing NET in combination with <b>mestranol</b> or EE, such as Norlestrin and Norinyl, were marketed in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|Both NET and NETA {{are also}} {{available}} in the U.S. as contraceptives. NET is available both alone (brand names Camila, Errin, Heather, Micronor, Nor-QD, others) and in combination with EE (Ortho-Novum, others) or <b>mestranol</b> (Norinyl), while NETA is available only in combination with EE (Norlestrin, others). NETE is not available in the U.S. in any form.|$|E
25|$|Ethinylestradiol (EE) is a {{more potent}} {{synthetic}} analogue of estradiol that is used widely in hormonal contraceptives. <b>Mestranol,</b> moxestrol, and quinestrol are derivatives of EE used clinically. A related drug is methylestradiol, which is also used clinically. Conjugated equine estrogens (CEEs), such as Premarin, a commonly prescribed estrogenic drug produced from the urine of pregnant mares, include the natural steroidal estrogens equilin and equilenin, as well as, especially, estrone sulfate (which itself is inactive and becomes active upon conversion into estrone). A related and very similar product to CEEs is esterified estrogens (EEs).|$|E
25|$|On June 10, 1957, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{approved}} Enovid 10mg (9.85mg noretynodrel and 150µg <b>mestranol)</b> for menstrual disorders, {{based on}} data from its use by more than 600 women. Numerous additional contraceptive trials showed Enovid at 10, 5, and 2.5mg doses to be highly effective. On July 23, 1959, Searle filed a supplemental application to add contraception as an approved indication for 10, 5, and 2.5mg doses of Enovid. The FDA refused to consider the application until Searle agreed to withdraw the lower dosage forms from the application. On May 9, 1960, the FDA announced it would approve Enovid 10mg for contraceptive use, and did so on June 23, 1960. At that point, Enovid 10mg had been in general use for three years and, by conservative estimate, at least half a million women had used it.|$|E

50|$|Around 1969, <b>mestranol</b> was {{replaced}} by ethinylestradiol in most or all combined oral contraceptives due to widespread panic about the recently uncovered increased risk of venous thromboembolism with estrogen-containing oral contraceptives.

Whether this actually did result in a lower incidence of venous thromboembolism has never been assessed.|$|E

In 1953 he synthesized norethandrolone, which as Nilevar was approved in 1956 as the first oral anabolic steroid. In 1954 Colton and Paul D. Klimstra synthesized the progestin etynodiol diacetate, which combined with the estrogen <b>mestranol</b> as Ovulen was approved in 1965 as Searle's second oral contraceptive, and combined with the estrogen ethinylestradiol was approved in 1970 as Demulen.

50|$|Orally, EE {{is about}} 100 times as potent by weight as natural estrogens like {{micronized}} estradiol and conjugated equine estrogens.

50|$|Ethynerone (INN, USAN), {{also known}} as 17α-(2-chloroethynyl)estra-4,9-dien-17β-ol-3-one, is a steroidal {{progestin}} of the 19-nortestosterone group that was first reported in 1961 but was never marketed. Under the developmental code name MK-665, it was studied in combination with <b>mestranol</b> as an oral contraceptive. Development of the drug was discontinued due to concerns surrounding toxicity findings in dogs. It is a chloroethynylated derivative of norethisterone.|$|E
50|$|In April 1956, {{noretynodrel}} was investigated, in Puerto Rico, in {{the first}} large-scale clinical trial of a progestogen as an oral contraceptive. The trial was conducted in Puerto Rico due to the high birth rate {{in the country and}} concerns of moral censure in the United States. It was discovered early into the study that the initial chemical syntheses of noretynodrel had been contaminated with small amounts (1-2%) of the 3-methyl ether of ethinylestradiol (noretynodrel having been synthesized from ethinylestradiol). When this impurity was removed, higher rates of breakthrough bleeding occurred. As a result, <b>mestranol,</b> that same year (1956), was developed and serendipitously identified as a very potent synthetic estrogen (and eventually as a prodrug of ethinylestradiol), given its name, and added back to the formulation. This resulted in Enovid by G. D. Searle & Company, the first oral contraceptive and a combination of 9.85 mg noretynodrel and 150 μg <b>mestranol</b> per pill.|$|E
