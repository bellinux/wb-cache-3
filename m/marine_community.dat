2500|$|Efforts {{were made}} to bring the ship off the rock, but these were halted on November 12, 1949, and, two days later, the {{underwriters}} declared {{that the value of}} the vessel would not justify further expense to refloat the ship. [...] The hulk was sold to Victor David, who ran a food processing firm, reportedly for $1,600. [...] Two days later, David was able to have the holes in the hull patched, pull the vessel free, and have it beached in North Vancouver, where he planned to convert it to a food processing plant. [...] This was considered a salvage feat by the local <b>marine</b> <b>community.</b> [...] The city apparently needed to approve this conversion. [...] It did not, and so David sold the hulk for scrap in 1951. [...] The hulk was purchased by a San Francisco firm for $25,000, and towed south to that city where it was finally dismantled.|$|E

40|$|The {{earth is}} losing {{biodiversity}} and ecosystem services due to anthropogenic impacts, {{and one way}} to mitigate this is to establish protected areas. Despite an increase in their global coverage, biodiversity is decreasing, while the world’s human footprint and population density are increasing. Effective coastal conservation requires {{a better understanding of}} how human activities on land may affect adjacent <b>marine</b> <b>communities,</b> but empirical work is lacking. My dissertation examines the synergistic benefits of co-locating protected areas and examines connections between terrestrial protection and nearshore marine protection by studying seagrass health, (1) a large-scale, multi-island field study of how human use of terrestrial watersheds directly and indirectly affect recipient <b>marine</b> <b>communities,</b> (2) a field experiment measuring the influence of the flux of sediments from human-impacted vs. non-impacted terrestrial watersheds on three adjacent nearshore island <b>marine</b> <b>communities,</b> (3) an exploration of the ecosystem services provided by seagrass beds, specifically small-scale fisheries. Integrating terrestrial with marine protection can improve coastal conservation efficiency. Using the tropical seagrass system, my dissertation provides evidence that terrestrial protection is more important than marine protection for nearshore marine health. Proper management of shallow-water marine resources should take into account stewardship of the adjacent watersheds and coastlines...|$|R

50|$|During {{his term}} as Minister of the Navy, he was {{responsible}} for the total reconstruction of the Portuguese commercial navy organized under Dispatch 100. Fifty-six ships were ordered, with a total of more than 300,000 tons of displacement. The dispatch included statutes that also allowed the formation of what is now the modern shipbuilding industry in Portugal. Tomás' actions while serving as Minister of the Navy won him a positive reputation in the <b>marine</b> <b>community,</b> unlike the infamy acquired by several of his colleagues in the Portuguese Armed Forces (FAP) and the Portuguese government during their respective tenures.|$|E
50|$|There {{were serious}} {{stumbling}} blocks {{arising out of}} this reorganization, namely in the different management practices and differences in organizational culture at DFO, versus DOT. DFO is dedicated to conservation and protection of fish through enforcement whereas the CCG's primary focus is marine safety and SAR. There were valid concerns raised within CCG about reluctance {{on the part of}} the <b>marine</b> <b>community</b> to ask for assistance from CCG vessels, since the CCG was being viewed as aligned with an enforcement department. In the early 2000s, the federal government began to investigate the possibility of remaking CCG as a separate agency, thereby not falling under a specific functional department and allowing more operational independence.|$|E
