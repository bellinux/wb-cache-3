40|$|Okadaic acid (OA) causes meiotic {{progression}} and chromosome condensation in cultured pachytene spermatocytes and {{an increase}} in maturation promoting factor (cyclin B 1 /cdc 2 kinase) activity, as evaluated by H 1 phosphorylative activity in anti-cyclin B 1 immunoprecipitates. OA also induces a strong increase of phosphorylative activity toward the mitogen-activated protein kinase substrate myelin basic protein (MBP). Immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK 1) or anti-ERK 2 antibodies followed by MBP kinase assays, and direct in-gel kinase assays for MBP, show that p 44 /ERK 1 but not p 42 /ERK 2 is stimulated in OA-treated spermatocytes. OA treatment stimulates phosphorylation of ERK 1, but not of ERK 2, on a tyrosine residue involved in activation of the enzyme. ERK 1 immunoprecipitated from extracts of OA-stimulated spermatocytes induces a stimulation of H 1 kinase activity in extracts from control pachytene spermatocytes, whereas immunoprecipitated ERK 2 is uneffective. We also show that natural G(2) /M transition in spermatocytes is associated to intracellular redistribution of ERKs, and their association with microtubules of the metaphase spindle. Preincubation of cultured pachytene spermatocytes with PD 98059 (a selective inhibitor of ERK-activating kinases MEK 1 / 2) completely blocks the ability of OA to induce chromosome condensation and progression to <b>meiotic</b> <b>metaphases.</b> These results suggest that ERK 1 is specifically activated during G(2) /M transition in mouse spermatocytes, that it contributes to the mechanisms of maturation promoting factor activation, and that it is essential for chromosome condensation associated with progression to <b>meiotic</b> <b>metaphases...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe MLH 1 {{protein is}} {{required}} for normal meiosis in mice and its absence leads to failure in maintenance of pairing between bivalent chromosomes, abnormal meiotic division, and ensuing sterility in both sexes. In this study, we investigated whether failure to develop foci of MLH 1 protein on chromosomes in prophase would lead to elimination of prophase spermatocytes, and, if not, whether univalent chromosomes could align normally on the meiotic spindle and whether metaphase spermatocytes would be delayed and/or eliminated. In spite {{of the absence of}} MLH 1 foci, no apoptosis of spermatocytes in prophase was detected. In fact, chromosomes of pachytene spermatocytes from Mlh 1 −/− mice were competent to condense metaphase chromosomes, both in vivo and in vitro. Most condensed chromosomes were univalents with spatially distinct FISH signals. Typical metaphase events, such as synaptonemal complex breakdown and the phosphorylation of Ser 10 on histone H 3, occurred in Mlh 1 −/− spermatocytes, suggesting that there is no inhibition of onset of <b>meiotic</b> <b>metaphase</b> in the face of massive chromosomal abnormalities. However, the condensed univalent chromosomes did not align correctly onto the spindle apparatus in the majority of Mlh 1 −/− spermatocytes. Most <b>meiotic</b> <b>metaphase</b> spermatocytes were characterized with bipolar spindles, but chromosomes radiated away from the microtubule-organizing centers in a prometaphase-like pattern rather than achieving a bipolar orientation. Apoptosis was not observed until after the onset of <b>meiotic</b> <b>metaphase.</b> Thus, spermatocytes are not eliminated in direct response to the initial meiotic defect, but are eliminated later. Taken together, these observations suggest that a spindle assembly checkpoint, rather than a recombination or chiasmata checkpoint, may be activated in response to meiotic errors, thereby ensuring elimination of chromosomally abnormal gamete precursors...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} shows that the COOH-terminal CaaX motif of lamins is necessary to target newly synthesized proteins to the nuclear envelope membranes. Isoprenylation at the CaaX-cysteine has been taken to explain the different fates of A- and B-type lamins during cell division. A-type lamins, which loose their isoprenylation shortly after incorporation into the lamina structure, become freely soluble upon mitotic nuclear envelope breakdown. Somatic B-type lamins, in contrast, are permanently isoprenylated and, although depolymerized during mitosis, remain associated with remnants of nuclear envelope membranes. However, Xenopus lamin B 3, the major B-type lamin of amphibian oocytes and eggs, becomes soluble after nuclear envelope breakdown in <b>meiotic</b> <b>metaphase.</b> Here we show that Xenopus lamin B 3 is permanently isoprenylated and carboxyl methylated in oocytes (interphase) and eggs (<b>meiotic</b> <b>metaphase).</b> When transfected into mouse L cells Xenopus lamin B 3 is integrated into the host lamina and responds to cell cycle signals in a normal fashion.

The present investigation was designated to assess the modulating effect of melatonin (MLT) against lead acetate (LA) genotoxicity. Three cytogenetic end points were considered: the frequencies of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocyte cells (MnPCEs) in the bone marrow, the chromosomal aberration in the primary spermatocytes and the frequency of sperm abnormalities. Male mice were used in this experiment; animals were divided into 8 groups of 6 animals each. First group received an oral gavage of solvent (4 % ethanol) and served as control and the other groups received an oral gavage of MLT (10 mg/kg) and/or 10, 50, 100 mg/kg body weight of lead acetate for 11 days. Mice were scarified 24 h after the last treatment. Examination and analysis of MnPCEs and <b>meiotic</b> <b>metaphases</b> showed no mutagenic effect of melatonin.

Milne Edwards, by chromosome localization of the highly conserved major ribosomal gene family and the pentanucleotide (TTAGG) telomeric repeat, the most widespread telomeric sequence among arthropods. Material and methods Mitotic and <b>meiotic</b> <b>metaphases</b> were obtained from gonad tissue of adult males of the three species by the air-drying technique. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on chromosomal preparations by using a 45 S rDNA and a pentameric (TTAGG) repeat as probes. Results The 45 S rDNA FISH localize the major ribosomal genes in the three lobsters in several chromosomal pairs. In the three species, (TTAGG) repeat FISH produced bright fluorescent signals {{at the end of the}} chromosomes, furthermore strong signals in interstitial position (ITS) were observed. Discussion The chromosome complement of N. norvegicus, H. gammarus and H. americanus is made up of a high number of little size chromosomes, more than 100 in all species; furthermore in N. norvegicus and H. americanus supernumerary chromosomes have been reported (Coluccia et al., 2004). This is the first report of ribosomal genes localization by FISH in Nephropidae; mulitple NORs have been already observed in other decapods like Palinurus elephas (Coluccia et al., 2006). The presence in the lobsters of the TTAGG repeat as telomeric sequence is in accordance with the hypotesis that the pentanucletide TTAGG is an ancestral motif of telomeres for arthropods and the presence of ITS could be the remnant of chromosome rearrangements and/or inequal crossing-over...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that Xenopus oocytes arrested at second <b>meiotic</b> <b>metaphase</b> lost their characteristic multicisternal Golgi apparati and cannot secrete proteins {{into the surrounding}} medium. In this paper, we extend these studies to ask whether intracellular transport events affecting the movement of secretory proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus are also similarly inhibited in such oocytes. Using the acquisition of resistance to endoglycosidase H (endo H) as an assay for movement to the Golgi, we find that within 6 h, up to 66 % of the influenza virus membrane protein, hemagglutinin (HA), synthesized from injected synthetic RNA, can move to the Golgi apparati in nonmatured oocytes; indeed after longer periods some correctly folded HA can be detected at the cell surface where it distributes in a nonpolarized fashion. In matured oocytes, up to 49 % of the HA becomes endo H resistant in the same 6 -h period. We conclude that movement from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi can occur in matured oocytes despite the dramatic fragmentation of the Golgi apparati that we observe to occur on maturation. This observation of residual protein movement during <b>meiotic</b> <b>metaphase</b> contrasts with the situation at mitotic metabphase in cultured mammalian cells where all movement ceases, but resembles that in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae where transport is unaffected...|$|E
40|$|The HCO 3 −/Cl− {{exchanger}} is quiescent in the unfertilized mouse egg but {{is highly}} active in regulating intracellular pH {{in the early}} embryo and required for normal development. We show here that the HCO 3 −/Cl− exchanger is active in first meiotic prophase (GV) oocyte but inactivated during <b>meiotic</b> <b>metaphase</b> before the MI to MII transition. Reactivation does not occur until the activated egg enters interphase. A quiescent HCO 3 −/Cl− exchanger {{is not simply a}} general feature of metaphase, because activity did not decrease during first mitotic metaphase. Inactivation of the HCO 3 −/Cl− exchanger during MI coincided with the activation of MAP kinase (MAPK), whereas its reactivation coincided with the loss of MAPK activity after egg activation. Maintaining high MAPK activity after egg activation prevented the normal reactivation of the HCO 3 −/Cl− exchanger. Inactivating MAPK in unfertilized MII eggs resulted in HCO 3 −/Cl− exchanger activation. Preventing MAPK activation during first <b>meiotic</b> <b>metaphase</b> prevented the inactivation of HCO 3 −/Cl− exchange. Conversely, activating MAPK in the GV oocyte resulted in inactivation of HCO 3 −/Cl− exchange. These results imply that the HCO 3 −/Cl− exchanger in mouse oocytes is negatively regulated by MAPK. Thus, suppression of pH-regulatory mechanisms during meiosis is a novel function of MAPK and cytostatic factor activity in the oocyte...|$|E

Serum E. K. crossreacts with an 80 -kD protein in mouse cells and detects the centromere/kinetochore complex in permeabilized cells or when microinjected into living oocytes.

Larger amounts of Ca 2 +-induced contraction over the entire surface of oocytes or eggs, but did not induce cleavage-like constrictions; smaller amounts of Ca 2 + produced either a local cortical granule reaction {{of the formation of}} one large and one small "blastomere. " Furrow formation was not observed during normally induced maturation until after germinal vesicle breakdown. The location of microinjected Ca 2 + determined the orientation of the resulting furrow. Ca 2 +-induced cortical granule breakdown occurred in full-grown nonmaturing oocytes near the site of injection. Cortical granule breakdown also occurred in maturing oocytes (after germinal vesicle breakdown but before second <b>meiotic</b> <b>metaphase),</b> but only in the blastomere containing the infected Ca 2 +. As expected, in mature oocytes (at second <b>meiotic</b> <b>metaphase)</b> cortical granule breakdown occurred over the entire oocyte surface, including both blastomeres. The results indicate that furrow formation and cleavage-like constrictions may be directly influenced by Ca 2 +, and that functional contractile elements are present near all areas of the oocyte surface. Furthermore, Ca 2 + injection initiates localized cortical granule breakdown in full-grown immature and maturing oocytes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractInositol 3, 4, 5 -triphosphate (InsP 3) {{brought about}} {{cortical}} granule exocytosis and elevation of a fertilization membrane, {{due to a}} rapid increase of free calcium in cytoplasm, when injected into oocytes of the amphibian Xenopus laevis arrested at second <b>meiotic</b> <b>metaphase.</b> The same result was observed when injection was performed into oocytes of the starfish Marthasterias glacialis arrested either at the first meiotic prophase or after completion of meiosis. Although meiotic maturation was induced in both animals by specific hormones which have been previously shown to release Ca 2 + within cytoplasm, InsP 3 microinjection into prophasearrested oocytes did not release them from prophase block...|$|E

We made a {{cytogenetic}} {{study of}} Rineloricaria pentamaculata from the Tauá Stream, in the Pirapó River sub-basin in Paraná State, Brazil, {{focused on the}} occurrence and origins of the B chromosomes. The diploid number varied from 2 n = 56 to 2 n = 59, due {{to the presence of}} 0 to 3 B microchromosomes of the acrocentric type, which were observed in 92. 3 % of the specimens (N = 12). These chromosomes were totally heterochromatic, with the C banding technique, and there were inter- and intraindividual numerical differences. <b>Meiotic</b> cells in <b>metaphase</b> I had 28 bivalent chromosomes and 0 to 3 univalent chromosomes. We suggest that the B microchromosomes are centric fragments originated from chromosome rearrangements...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{microgravity}} on meiosis, fertilization, and early embryonic development in mammals are being examined {{by using a}} clinostat to reorient the cells {{with respect to the}} gravity vector. A clinostat capable of supporting mammalian cells in tissue culture has been developed. Initial studies have focused on examining the effects of clinostat rotation on meiotic maturation in mouse oocytes. Oocytes recovered from ovarian follicles were subjected to clinostat rotation on a horizontal or vertical axis or to static conditions for a 16 hr period. No gross morphological changes and no effects on germinal vesicle breakdown were observed under any rotation conditions (1 / 4, 1, 10, 30, 100 RPM). Success of <b>meiotic</b> progression to <b>Metaphase</b> II was comparable among experimental and control groups except at 100 RPM, where a slight inhibition was observed...|$|R
