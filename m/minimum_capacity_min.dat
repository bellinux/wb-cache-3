40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{investigate}} the multicast capacity for static ad hoc networks with heterogeneous clusters. We study {{the effect of}} heterogeneous cluster traffic (HCT) on the achievable capacity. HCT means cluster clients {{are more likely to}} appear near the cluster head, instead of being uniformly distributed across the network. Such property is commonly found in real networks. By adopting max-min fairness, the minimum among all individual multicast capacities of clusters can be maximized. Since this minimal individual multicast capacity will not be maximized unlimitedly, our work focuses on deriving the upper bound of the <b>minimum</b> individual multicast <b>capacity</b> (we refer it as <b>minimum</b> <b>capacity</b> for simplicity) in HCT, which provides the best performance for the <b>minimum</b> multicast <b>capacity</b> to attain in the whole network. We find that HCT increases <b>minimum</b> <b>capacity</b> for ad hoc networks. Further, the multicast capacity achieving scheme is provided to justify the derived asymptotic upper bound for the <b>minimum</b> <b>capacity.</b> Our work can generalize various results obtained under non-heterogeneous networks in previous literature...|$|R

We provide a brief overview of the most important algorithms for the minimum cut problem and compare these methods both on problem instances from the literature and graphs originating from the solution of the traveling salesman problem by branch-and-cut. 1. Introduction Computer programs that compute <b>minimum</b> <b>capacity</b> cuts in undirected graphs with nonnegative edge capacities belong to the most intensively used basic tools in optimization. Besides the obvious direct application of deciding the degree of connectivity of a given network, the main reason is that various separation routines in cutting plane algorithms depend on the practically efficient computation of <b>minimum</b> <b>capacity</b> cuts. The most prominent example is the separation of subtour elimination constrain [...] ...|$|R

In contrast, the outflow of a wide moving jam [...] determines a condition {{for the existence of}} the wide moving jam, i.e., the traffic phase J while the jam propagates in free flow: Indeed, if the jam propagates through free flow (i.e., both upstream and downstream of the jam free flows occur), then a wide moving jam can persist, only when the jam inflow [...] is equal to or larger than the jam outflow otherwise, the jam dissolves over time.
