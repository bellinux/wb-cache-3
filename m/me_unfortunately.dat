60|$|Another day was now gone, and we {{all went}} to bed. Had I not been very foolish I should have had myself called at five in the morning, and have gone away by the early boat, leaving my ten napoleons behind <b>me.</b> But, <b>unfortunately,</b> Sophonisba had exacted a promise from me that I would not do this, and thus all chance of {{spending}} {{a day or two}} in Venice was lost to me. Moreover, I was thoroughly fatigued, and almost glad of any excuse which would allow me to lie in bed on the following morning. I did lie in bed till nine o'clock, and then found the Greenes at breakfast.|$|R

"I too loved {{a virtuous}} maiden, and, {{stranger}} still, I fancy she loved <b>me,</b> but <b>unfortunately</b> {{there was one}} of the other kind too, and the result thereof was as usual--disaster. I've been trying to remedy that disaster--did you ever wonder where my dividends went to? Well, there is a reason why I'm anxious to find a mine. If we do, I'll tell you the sequel. Otherwise--and things do happen unexpectedly--there's a leather case in my pocket, and in case of accident I hope my partners will act on what they find in it. Perhaps some one in England would bless them if they did." ...|$|R
60|$|I hear I am not {{expected}} {{to give an account}} of the disagreement between the two gentlemen, of which this lady was the cause.

60|$|Spugg's wealth, I say, {{he regards}} as a solemn trust. I have often {{asked him why}} he didn't give it, for example, to a college. But he tells <b>me</b> that <b>unfortunately</b> he is not a college man. I have called his {{attention}} to the need of further pensions for college professors; after all that Mr. Carnegie and others have done, there are still thousands and thousands of old professors of thirty-five and even forty, working away day after day and getting nothing but what they earn themselves, and with no provision beyond the age of eighty-five. But Mr. Spugg says that these men are the nation's heroes. Their work is its own reward.|$|R

40|$|The {{letter of}} J. E. Rosenblatt (6) refutes some {{published}} work affirming Blastocystis hominis {{to be an}} important agent of intestinal disease in humans. The superb and well-con-trolled study by Kain et al. is one example of a plethora of sound studies (2). The proportion of affirmative literature on B. hominis pathogenicity to the "anti " literature is approx-imately 20 : 1. The two most quoted "anti " articles are basically flawed. A complete bibliography can be found in an upcoming review by <b>me</b> (11). <b>Unfortunately,</b> the scant criticism in the literature of work on the pathogenicity of this protozoan is based on specula-tion rather than credible data.

60|$|To <b>me,</b> <b>unfortunately</b> perhaps (for I speak merely of {{individual}} taste), a cat is a wild animal. A cat is Nature personified. Like Nature, {{it is so}} mysterious that one cannot quite repose even in its beauty. But like Nature again, it is so beautiful that one cannot {{believe that it is}} really cruel. Perhaps it isn't; and there again it is like Nature. Men of old time worshipped cats as they worshipped crocodiles; and those magnificent old mystics knew what they were about. The moment in which one really loves cats is the same as that in which one (moderately and within reason) loves crocodiles. It is that divine instant when a man feels himself&mdash;no, not absorbed into the unity of all things (a loathsome fancy)&mdash;but delighting in the difference of all things. At the moment when a man really knows he is a man he will feel, however faintly, a kind of fairy-tale pleasure in the fact that a crocodile is a crocodile. All the more will he exult in the things that are more evidently beautiful than crocodiles, such as flowers and birds and eats&mdash;which are more beautiful than either. But it does not follow that he will wish to pick all the flowers or to cage all the birds or to own all the cats.|$|E
60|$|We {{had come}} to see blackguards; but these men were {{something}} worse. There is a comic side, more or less appreciable, in all blackguardism--here there was nothing but tragedy--mute, weird tragedy. The quiet in the room was horrible. The thin, haggard, long-haired young man, whose sunken eyes fiercely watched the turning up of the cards, never spoke; the flabby, fat-faced, pimply player, who pricked his piece of pasteboard perseveringly, to register how often black won, and how often red--never spoke; the dirty, wrinkled old man, with the vulture eyes and the darned great-coat, who had lost his last sou, and still looked on desperately, after he could play no longer--never spoke. Even the voice of the croupier sounded as if it were strangely dulled and thickened in the atmosphere of the room. I had entered the place to laugh, but the spectacle before me was something to weep over. I soon found it necessary to take refuge in excitement from the depression of spirits which was fast stealing on <b>me.</b> <b>Unfortunately</b> I sought the nearest excitement, by going to the table and beginning to play. Still more unfortunately, as the event will show, I won--won prodigiously; won incredibly; won at such a rate that the regular players at the table crowded round me; and staring at my stakes with hungry, superstitious eyes, whispered to one another that the English stranger was going to break the bank.|$|E
6000|$|The usual {{verdict of}} educated {{people on the}} Salvation Army is {{expressed}} in some such words as these: [...] "I have no doubt they do {{a great deal of}} good, but they do it in a vulgar and profane style; their aims are excellent, but their methods are wrong." [...] To <b>me,</b> <b>unfortunately,</b> the precise reverse of this appears to be the truth. I do not know whether the aims of the Salvation Army are excellent, but I am quite sure their methods are admirable. Their methods are the methods of all intense and hearty religions; they are popular like all religion, military like all religion, public and sensational like all religion. They are not reverent any more than Roman Catholics are reverent, for reverence in the sad and delicate meaning of the term reverence is a thing only possible to infidels. That beautiful twilight you will find in Euripides, in Renan, in Matthew Arnold; but in men who believe you will not find it--you will find only laughter and war. A man cannot pay that kind of reverence to truth solid as marble; they can only be reverent towards a beautiful lie. And the Salvation Army, though their voice has broken out in a mean environment and an ugly shape, are really the old voice of glad and angry faith, hot as the riots of Dionysus, wild as the gargoyles of Catholicism, not to be mistaken for a philosophy. Professor Huxley, in one of his clever phrases, called the Salvation Army [...] "corybantic Christianity." [...] Huxley was the last and noblest of those Stoics who have never understood the Cross. If he had understood Christianity he would have known that there never has been, and never can be, any Christianity that is not corybantic.|$|E

50|$|The {{spread of}} and missionary zeal {{people of the}} area awarded the value of education, {{and by that time}} one Garo youth by the name of Gracesh G. Sangma, son of Choetsing D. Sangma, the first among the Garos’ of the area to study in Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Serampore College, {{inspired}} for opening <b>M.E.</b> School. <b>Unfortunately</b> Gracesh G. Sangma, who was serving in Royal Air Force died prematurely in 1946 after a brief illness while he was on leave. Inspired by Gracesh Sangma, Noho B. Sangma of Darugre convened a meeting of elders and resolved for opening M.E. School at Ampati. Consequently, in 1947 an Upper Primary School was established with Noho B.Sangma, as headmaster. The School was stopped for some time in the beginning of 1948 due to some controversial matters between the headmaster Judson Sangma and students. After convening a meeting the village elders decided to appoint a new Headmaster, and from among the contenders Shri Nolidi S. Daring was persuaded to serve as Headmaster. Since 1947 to 2007 the school is functioning for 60 years.|$|R

6000|$|I {{might have}} waited long. Perhaps I lack a sense; for our whole {{existence}} {{seemed to me}} one dreary bustle, and the place we bustled in fitly {{to be called the}} Place of Yawning. I slept in a little den behind the office; Pinkerton, in the office itself, stretched on a patent sofa which sometimes collapsed, his slumbers still further menaced by an imminent clock with an alarm. Roused by this diabolical contrivance, we rose early, went forth early to breakfast, and returned by nine to what Pinkerton called work, and I distraction. Masses of letters must be opened, read, and answered; some by me at a subsidiary desk which had been introduced on the morning of my arrival; others by my bright-eyed friend, pacing the room like a caged lion as he dictated to the tinkling type-writers. Masses of wet proof had to be overhauled and scrawled upon with a blue pencil--"rustic"; [...] "six-inch caps"; [...] "bold spacing here"; or sometimes terms more fervid--as, for instance, this (which I remember Pinkerton to have spirted on the margin of an advertisement of Soothing Syrup), [...] "Throw this all down. Have you never printed an advertisement? I'll be round in half-an-hour." [...] The ledger and sale-book, besides, we had always with us. Such was the backbone of our occupation, and tolerable enough; but the far greater proportion of our time was consumed by visitors--whole-souled, grand fellows no doubt, and as sharp as a needle, but to <b>me</b> <b>unfortunately</b> not diverting. Some were apparently half-witted, and must be talked over by the hour before they could reach the humblest decision, which they only left the office to return again (ten minutes later) and rescind. Others came with a vast show of hurry and despatch, but I observed it to be principally show. The agricultural model, for instance, which was practicable, proved a kind of fly-paper for these busybodies. I have seen them blankly turn the crank of it for five minutes at a time, simulating (to nobody's deception) business interest: [...] "Good thing this, Pinkerton? Sell much of it? Ha! Couldn't use it, I suppose, as a medium of advertisement for my article?"--which was perhaps toilet soap. Others (a still worse variety) carried us to neighbouring saloons to dice for cocktails and (after the cocktails were paid) for dollars on a corner of the counter. The attraction of dice for all these people was, indeed, extraordinary: at a certain club where I once dined in the character of [...] "my partner, Mr. Dodd," [...] the dice-box came on the table with the wine, an artless substitute for after-dinner wit.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have never}} yet thanked {{you for the}} amiable note in which you kindly invited me to write {{to you from the}} Americas; and the best way I can do so now is to simply respond to your invitation. I am in the Americas indeed, and behold I write. These {{countries}} are extremely pleasant, and I recommend you to come and see them au plus tôt. You would have a great career here, and would return--if you should return at all--with a multitude of scalps at your slim girdle. There is a great demand for brilliant women, and I can promise you that you would be intimately appreciated. I shall return about the first of May--but without any blond scalps, though with a great many happy impressions. Though I should perhaps not linger upon the point myself, I believe I have had a certain success. As for ces gens-ci, they have had great success with me, and have been delightfully genial and hospitable. It is here that people treat you well; venez-y voir. You have had a great many things, I know; but you have not had a winter in the Americas. The people are extremely nice and humane. I didn't care for it much at first--but it improves immensely on acquaintance, and after you have got the right point of view and diapason it is a wonderfully entertaining and amusing country. The skies are as blue as the blotting paper (as yet unspotted) on which this scrawl reposes, and the sunshine, which is deliciously warm, has always an air de fête. I have seen multitudes of people, and no one has been disagreeable. That is different from your pretentious Old World. Of Washington I can speak as yet but little, having come but four days ago; but it is like nothing else in the old world or the new. Enormous spaces, hundreds of miles of asphalte, a charming climate and the most entertaining society in America. I spent a month in Boston and another in New York, and have paid three or four visits in the country. All this was very jolly, and it is pleasant to be in one's native land, where one is someone and something.
