40|$|Citation: Edwards, Elizabeth. The home dairy. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1892. Introduction: A {{supply of}} good milk and butter {{is among the}} necessities in every home. The many {{substantial}} and dainty articles of food made from these products makes it essential that they be palatable and unadulterated. In order, however, to obtain the best results from the dairy, {{it is important to}} consider wisely the erection of a convenient, well ventilated dairy building, and also a careful management of the milk after it is drawn until the cream is made into butter. A good dairy building is found wanting however, in the many farm-houses of today, and the milk that is supplied to the house is consequently strained into crocks and pans and placed on a shelf somewhere out of the way. The most convenient or common place is in a damp musty cellar where a little of everything is kept; as potatoes, turnips, cabbage, onions, the gradual decomposition of which makes the cellar a very unfit place to keep milk good and sweet. The dairy may be constructed as a separate building or it may be connected with the home. If there be a running stream not far from the house and from the cow stable, it would be to an advantage to build a dairy of moderate size near it. The dairy building should be partitioned off into a <b>milk</b> <b>room,</b> a butter room, and a small room where the dairy utensils might be washed...|$|E
40|$|The study {{investigates the}} risk {{exposure}} to HIV infection among South African children aged 2 - 9 years served by public health services. Together with their biological mothers, 3471 children and {{were recruited from}} inpatient and outpatient children in the Free State Province. Blood samples were taken by professional nurses and a history taken of exposure factors associated with HIV transmission. DNA testing was used to confirm biological maternity where the child was HIV-positive and the mother HIV-negative. Mother-child pairs were stratified by mother's HIV status. Exposure factors related to the child's HIV status were examined in each stratum using a chi-square test. Independent factors were then included in a multiple logistic regression model. Having an HIV-positive mother was strongly related to HIV infection in children (OR: 310; 95 %CI: 148 - 781). However, seven HIV-positive children had HIV-negative mothers. Transmission in this group {{was significantly associated with}} breastfeeding by a non-biological mother (OR: 437; 95 %CI: 53 - 5020), being fed with expressed breast milk from a <b>milk</b> <b>room</b> (OR: 37. 6; 95 %CI: 6. 2 - 259. 0), dental injection history (OR: 31. 5; 95 %CI: 4. 5 - 189. 4) and visits to a dentist (OR: 26. 9; 95 %CI: 4. 4 - 283. 5). Although mother-to-child-transmission is shown to be the primary mode of HIV transmission in South African children, the few HIV-positive children infected by other modes of transmission suggest a potential risk of non-vertical HIV infections. These infections can be prevented through education and improved infection-control procedures. © 2008 Taylor & Francis. Articl...|$|E

One patient (1.2 %) only needed invasive ventilation for 10  days, 18 (21 %) received either NIV or high flow oxygen for 3  days [1; 9], 34 patients (40 %) received standard oxygen for 3  days [1; 7] and 34 patients (40 %) received no respiratory support. Forty-five (53 %) patients received nutritional support, either enteraly (N =  38, 45 %) or parenteraly (N =  5, 6 %) or both (N =  2, 2.4 %). Most breastfeeding mothers (96 %) did not smoke and lived as a couple (98 %), 2 % of mothers were working at the time of hospitalisation. Sixty-five patients (77 %) were exclusively breastfed before hospitalisation. The median delay for phone contact was 3  month [0.5; 6]. Forty-three mothers (51 %) stated that their breastfeeding had been modified by the hospitalisation of their child: 17 stopped breastfeeding (Group 1), 12 switched from total to partial breastfeeding (Group 2) and 14 reduced breasfeeding without stopping (Group 3). Remaining mothers (Group 4) (41, 49 %) stated to have kept breastfeeding as before or that their breastfeeding modification was personal choice. Patients whose breastfeeding was more impacted had a tendency to being younger with a median age of 34  days [3; 166] vs 50  days [16; 159] on admission, p 0.06) and to be exclusively breastfed before (81 vs 73 %, NS).

40|$|D. Tech. (Biomedical Technology) Abstract: Contamination of {{hospital}} water systems with bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa {{is a potential}} risk for nosocomial infections to patients and medical personnel. Among these microorganisms, protozoa such as free-living amoebae (FLA) exist in high numbers in the natural aquatic environment where they play a useful role as predators of microorganisms. Free-living amoebae have also been isolated from man-made water systems such as cooling towers, hospital water networks and wastewater and drinking water plants. Although most FLA are non-pathogenic, some species including Naegleria fowleri, Balamuthia mandrillaris, Acanthamoeba species are known human pathogens and also harbour and transmit bacterial pathogens in the environment. These bacteria referred to as amoeba resistant bacteria (ARB) include nosocomial pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas species, Legionella pneumophila and environmental Mycobacterium species. Other non-pathogenic FLA such as Vermamoeba vermiformis, are also known carriers of pathogenic ARB. The importance of drinking water quality distributed through public health care facilities in Johannesburg, with special reference to FLA and certain ARB, has not been studied previously. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate the occurrence of potentially pathogenic FLA and their associated bacteria in three selected public hospital water networks in Johannesburg. This was an observational, descriptive study of the three water distribution systems. Walk-through assessments were conducted for the three water systems to determine areas of high risk for infection by waterborne pathogens and history of waterborne diseases in those areas. A sampling strategy was then established. A total of 275 water (143) and swab (132) samples were collected from the inlets, theatres, intensive care units, endoscopy units, renal units, neonatal ward, <b>milk</b> <b>room,</b> diarrhoea ward and sterilization units. The water physico-chemical elements: pH, temperature, residual chlorine and total dissolved solids were determined at the site of collection. The water samples were also tested for the presence of microbial indicators using the micro-most probable number (MPN) method. All the samples were filtered and analyzed using an amoebal enrichment technique. Observed autochthonous amoebae were then purified and examined for the presence of FLA and intracellular bacteria transmission electron microscopy,. ...|$|E

In a field study in a dairy sheep farm over 21 months, sixteen natural isolates of S. aureus were collected from six subclinical mastitis cases, one lethal gangrenous mastitis case, nasal carriage from eight ewes, and one isolate from ambient air in the <b>milking</b> <b>room.</b> A genomic comparison of two strains, one responsible for subclinical mastitis and one for lethal gangrenous mastitis, was performed using multi-strain DNA microarrays. Multiple typing techniques (pulsed-field-gel-electrophoresis, multiple-locus variable-number, single-nucleotide polymorphisms, randomly amplified polymorphic DNA, spa typing and sas typing) were used to characterise the remaining isolates and to follow {{the persistence of the}} gangrenous isolate in ewes nares. Our results showed that the two strains were genetically closely related and they shared 3 615 identical predicted open reading frames (ORF). However, the gangrenous mastitis isolate carried variant versions of several genes (sdrD, clfA-B, sasA, sasB, sasD, sasI, and splE) and was missing fnbB and a prophage. The typing results showed that this gangrenous strain emerged after the initial subclinical mastitis screening, but then persisted in the flock in the nares of four ewes. Although we cannot dismiss the role of host susceptibility in the clinical events in this flock, our data support the hypothesis that S. aureus populations had evolved in the sheep flock and that S. aureus genetic variations could have contributed to enhanced virulence...|$|R

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{study was conducted}} from October 2009 to March 2010 {{in order to assess}} the risk to public health associated with raw milk consumption. The study investigated raw milk consumption behaviour, factors associated with the consumption of raw milk and milk handling practices among dairy farming communities in urban and peri urban areas of Debre-Zeit. A total of 170 dairy farmers were surveyed. Whether the levels of education, income, urbanisation and awareness of milk borne diseases could be associated with raw milk consumption was tested by statistical analyses. Of the 170 participants, 54 (31. 8 %) producers had a habit of consuming raw milk. The proportion of dairy farmers consuming raw milk was significantly higher in peri urban areas (94. 8 %) than in urban areas of Debre-Zeit (13. 0 %, 2 = 89. 3, df= 1, OR= 124. 1, p < 0. 001). Of the factors tested, only residing in peri urban areas was significantly associated with consumption of raw milk (p < 0. 001). All, 29. 4 % and 19. 4 % of the farmers included in this study used plastic containers for transporting, milking and storing milk, respectively.

30|$|The {{expression}} of Bcl- 2, Bax, JNK, ERK 1 / 2, PARP, p 38 MAPK, phosphor-JNK, phosphor-ERK 1 / 2, phosphor-p 38 MAPK, cleaved caspase- 3, and β-actin in whole cell lysates {{were analyzed by}} sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylaminde gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane by semi-dry electrophoretic transfer at 20  V for 60  min using the semi-dry transfer system. The PVDF membranes were blocked with 5 % nonfat <b>milk</b> at <b>room</b> temperature for 1  h, incubated with the primary antibody (dilution 1 : 1, 000) in Tris/buffered saline/Tween 20 (TBST) containing 5 % bovine serum albumin overnight in 4 °C, and then incubated with the secondary antibody (dilution 1 : 1, 000) {{at room temperature for}} 1  h. Immunoreactive bands were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. β-actin was used as loading controls for the total protein content and showed no differences between groups.|$|R
