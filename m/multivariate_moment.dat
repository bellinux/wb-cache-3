A new class of rectangular orthogonal matrices is fundamental to the methodology, and these ``L-matrices'' can be deterministic, parametric or data specific in nature. The target moments determine an L-matrix, then infinitely many random samples with the same exact moments may be generated by multiplying the L-matrix by arbitrary random orthogonal matrices. The methodology is thus termed ``ROM simulation''. We discuss certain classes of random orthogonal matrices and show how each class produces samples with different characteristics. ROM simulation has applications to many problems that are resolved using standard Monte Carlo methods. But since no parametric assumptions are required there is no sampling error caused by the discrete approximation of a continuous distribution, which is {{a major source of}} error in standard Monte Carlo simulations.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this study is the {{application}} of the recently developed univariate moment method Extended Quadrature Method of Moments (EQMOM) (Yuan et al., 2012) to model soot formation in flames. Furthermore, it is combined with another advanced moment approach, called the Conditional Quadrature Method of Moments (CQMOM) (Yuan and Fox, 2011), and this extension leads to a bivariate model. Retaining the efficiency of a moment method, EQMOM enables the reconstruction of the number density function. CQMOM is a numerically robust <b>multivariate</b> <b>moment</b> method which allows a bivariate soot particle description in terms of particle volume and surface to take into account aggregation.

Both the EQMOM and the ECQMOM model are validated against experimental results for premixed burner-stabilized ethylene flames. Thereby, the gas phase is modeled using a modified version of a very detailed, well-established kinetic scheme, which is adapted to be consistent with the moment methods introduced. The results demonstrate the suitability of the applied models to describe both soot precursors and soot evolution in flames.

40|$|Stochastic {{fluctuations}} in cellular processes {{often have a}} dominant role in evoking heterogeneous behaviour in otherwise identical cells. From a modelling point of view, stochastic systems require specialised techniques to analyse and provide predictions about the underlying processes. Here we approach this problem by presenting several methods {{for the analysis of}} stochastic networks in molecular biology. First, we address the problem of obtaining simulated trajectories of such systems. This task can be computationally prohibitively expensive and a range of approximation schemes have been proposed to lighten the burden. Here, we develop a set of <b>multivariate</b> <b>moment</b> closures that allow us to describe the stochastic dynamics of nonlinear systems. We use multivariate Gaussian, lognormal, and gamma closure to capture how correlations between different molecular species, induced by the reaction dynamics, interact with stochastic effects. In addition to the approximation method we also introduce our Python-based package that provides numerous tools to help non-expert users in stochastic analysis. Next, we present an approach to quickly evaluate the levels of noise in both naturally evolved and engineered biological systems. Controlling the behaviour of cells by rationally guiding processes is an overarching aim of recent research, but stochasticity proves a formidable obstacle in obtaining reliable models and designs. Here, we compute the states reachable by a stochastic system under some biologically relevant control input in cases with uncertainty about parameter values. Our algorithm provides a set of bounds on molecular dynamics at the level of population statistics {{that can be used for}} evaluating competing models and control strategies. In the third part, we introduce a formalism to study cellular decision making influenced by noise. Understanding the heterogeneity of phenotypes within a cell population is a long-time challenge in modelling, and Waddington's notion of a developmental landscape has become a powerful conceptual framework for this problem. Here, we derive quantitative potential landscapes that allow us to explore the global dynamics of the system. Using this method we study how different sources of noise and modifications in experimental conditions can induce significant changes in the landscape and the assumed cell fates. Finally, we propose a framework for model selection taking into account the inherent stochasticity of biochemistry. One of the main objectives of mathematical biology is identifying the most appropriate models and parameter values to describe known experimental results and provide predictions.
