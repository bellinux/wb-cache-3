Firstly, can standard models of evaluation of multi-network vulnerability to cascading failure that rely {{on the existence of}} one largest connected component that remains in each network after losses lead to some substantial inaccuracies in some circumstances? We suggest that, in cases of network topologies vulnerable to fragmentation, modifying this model of robustness by allowing secondary components to remain viable when measuring post-attack viability can make a significant improvement. Secondly, if standard models of evaluation of multi-network vulnerability define the coupling relationship between nodes belonging to different networks to be one-to-one mappings, can allowing a node in given network to have <b>multiple</b> <b>counter</b> parts in another network change the system significantly? We suggest that it can have consequences on the way failure propagation is balanced between the coupled networks. Thirdly, is the generalised assumption that partitioning between network {{is a good way to}} decrease vulnerability to cascading failure in a network of networks misleading? We suggest that, introducing isolation as a force as equally destructive as failure propagation can alter drastically where the optimum robustness lies in such interconnected systems. Finally, we propose a solution to the consequent problem of seemingly ever increasing vulnerability of interdependent networks to both cascading failure and isolation: the use of permutable nodes that would give such systems rewiring capabilities.|$|E

The devices can be deterministic or nondeterministic and can be augmented with a pushdown stack. We investigate the relative computational power of these machines. Our results (where C 1 and C 2 are classes of machines) are of the following types: 1. Machines in C 1 and C 2 are incomparable. 2. Machines in C 1 are strictly weaker than machines in C 2. In obtaining results of these types, we use counting and “cut-and-paste” arguments as well as an interesting technique that shows that if a language were accepted by a device in a given class, then all recursively enumerable languages would be decidable. ...|$|R

In all cases, truncation of the side chain of sialic acids by mild periodate oxidation abolishes recognition by CD 22 Rg. Direct binding of CD 22 Rg to lymphoid cells also requires sialic acids and their side chains.

Instead of the typical saturating counter encoding of the states, the 2 -bit counter can be encoded such that the least significant bit directly represents whether the current state is strong or weak. This extra bit provides hysteresis to prevent the counters from switching directions too quickly. Past studies have exploited the strong bias of the direction bit to construct better branch predictors. We show that counters exhibit a strong bias in the hysteresis bit as well, suggesting that an entire bit dedicated to hysteresis is overkill. Using data-compression techniques, we empirically demonstrate that the information theoretic entropy of the hysteresis bit conveys less than 0. 18 bits per prediction of information for a gshare branch predictor.

40|$|The {{fractional}} quantum Hall effect (FQHE) is a canonical {{example of}} a topological phase in a correlated 2 D electron gas under strong magnetic field. While electric currents propagate as chiral downstream edge modes, chargeless upstream chiral neutral edge modes were recently observed only in hole-conjugate states (states filling ν, n+ 1 / 2 <ν<n+ 1, with n= 0, 1, 2, [...] .), and in the even denominator state ν= 5 / 2. It is believed that spontaneous 'density reconstruction' near {{the edges of the}} 2 D gas, leads to <b>multiple</b> <b>counter</b> propagating edge channels, being separated from each other by incompressible strips. Unavoidable disorder induces inter-channel tunneling; accompanied by Coulomb interaction it renormalizes the multiple edge channels to a downstream charge mode and upstream neutral edge mode(s), while maintaining the parity requirements (e. g., the heat conductance along the edge) dictated by the bulk. Here, we report of highly sensitive shot noise measurements that revealed unexpected presence of neutral modes in a variety of non-hole-conjugate fractional states. As already reported previously, we did not observe neutral modes in any of the integer states. In addition to the upstream neutral edge modes, we were surprised to find also neutral energy modes that propagate through the incompressible bulk. While along the edge, density reconstruction may account for the edge modes, we are not aware of a model that can account for the bulk modes. The proliferation of neutral modes, in every tested fractional state, changes drastically the accepted picture of FQHE states: an insulating bulk and 1 D chiral edge channels. The apparent ubiquitous presence of these energy modes may account for decoherence of fractional quasiparticles - preventing observation of coherent interference in the fractional regime...|$|E

30|$|We have {{presented}} changes to ways to define network interdependency and post-attack viability that significantly impact the topological robustness of coupled networks to random attacks from our simulation results. We have first {{shown that the}} topological robustness of more easily fragmented interconnected networks topologies (such as Watts-Strogattz and ring lattices topologies) can be significantly improved by allowing multiple largest remaining components to be viable. This points {{to the possibility that}} in easily fragmented networks, granting secondary, and by extension smaller connected components a greater viability could enhance significantly the robustness of the whole system. Furthermore, we have provided evidence that allowing a node in a given network to have <b>multiple</b> <b>counter</b> parts in another network (many-to-one mapping) can be an effective way to transfer damages due to cascading failure from one network to another without changing the robustness of the overall system. This observation could lead to speculate on the possibility of creating mechanisms of damage transfer, similar to the way water is transferred betweeen ballasts in a ship, but instead applied to shifting damages due to cascading failure in sub-networks. We have also observed that, in symbiotic networks, the highest robustness cannot be achieved just by increasing partitioning that would result in cutting off entire sub-networks, but rather by finding an optimal degree of coupling that simultaneously minimises the negative impact of isolation while limiting the probability of spreading cascading failure. If we were to speculate on how to translate this topological observation to the domain of functional robustness of infrastructure networks, we would observe that cascading failure being inherent to symbiotic interdependency, the more an infrastructure depends on connections between multiple different types of services in order to function properly, the more likely failure is to spread iteratively through different parts of a system during periods of stress or perturbation. The apparent propensity of modern infrastructure systems to require an increasing number of services to function together is likely to amplify that significant problem. One way to reduce the impact of the resulting symbiotic interdependency could be to design infrastructure nodes that can switch between different roles across distinct interdependent networks, such that they have the capacity to be functionally permutable. This mean that these nodes should not fulfil simultaneously multiple roles (e.g., dual infrastructures), but rather that they would have the ability to perform only one type of alternate service at any particular time. These rewiring capabilities akin to those found in the human brain could possibly give infrastructure networks the capacity to adapt while limiting the topological sensitivity to disruption associated with symbiotic interdependency.|$|E
