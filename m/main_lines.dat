5|$|Despite {{an early}} debut in 1896, the Budapest Gambit {{received}} attention from leading players {{only after a}} win as Black by Grandmaster Milan Vidmar over Akiba Rubinstein in 1918. It enjoyed a rise in popularity in the early 1920s, but nowadays is rarely played at the top level. It experiences a lower percentage of draws than other <b>main</b> <b>lines,</b> but also a lower overall performance for Black.|$|E
5|$|In {{their new}} form the {{locomotives}} {{were similar in}} outline to the N15 class, though suffered from the expectation amongst crews that they were an improved version of this type. Despite this, their ability to accelerate well was {{put to good use}} on cross-country trains between <b>main</b> <b>lines.</b> The class saw service into nationalisation in 1948. All had been withdrawn by 1957, with none preserved.|$|E

5|$|The Chard Canal was a tub boat canal built between 1835 and 1842. Chard Branch Line {{was created}} in 1860 to connect the two London and South Western Railway and Bristol and Exeter Railway <b>main</b> <b>lines</b> and ran through Chard until 1965.|$|E

5|$|By 1928 the Southern Railway {{was well}} served by large 4-6-0 express {{passenger}} locomotives, {{but there was an}} urgent need for a class to fulfill intermediate roles throughout the system. Maunsell’s previous attempt at developing his predecessor’s L class for this task had proven a disappointment, and the Drummond D15 and L12 classes were approaching the end of their useful lives on these services. An entirely new secondary express passenger locomotive was required to operate over the <b>main</b> <b>lines</b> throughout the system including those that had relatively short turntables.|$|E
5|$|By 3 May 1975, North Vietnamese forces {{controlled}} all of South Vietnam, just 55 {{days after}} opening their attack on Buôn Ma Thuột. During that time period, {{an army of}} approximately three-quarters of a million men was defeated by a force one-fourth its size. Since {{the end of the}} war, there has been much historical recrimination and discussion as to how and why such a lopsided victory had occurred. Four <b>main</b> <b>lines</b> of thought have remained particularly viable, all of which possess some validity, but all are also open to argument.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 20 September, the Eighth Ottoman Army {{had been}} pushed {{back out of the}} coastal Plain of Sharon and the Desert Mounted Corps was {{blocking}} the Seventh and what remained of the Eighth Armies' <b>main</b> <b>lines</b> of retreat northwards. The 60th Division held Tulkarm and Anebta, the 7th (Meerut) Division held the village of Beit Lid and controlled the crossroads at Deir Sheraf, while the 5th Light Horse Brigade had cut the Jenin railway south of Arrabe. Both the 3rd (Lahore) and 7th (Meerut) Divisions had continued to force the Seventh and Eighth Ottoman Armies' retreat.|$|E

Attempts to {{increase}} speeds to 140 mph on both the West Coast <b>Main</b> <b>Line</b> and East Coast <b>Main</b> <b>Line</b> have failed because the trains on those lines do not have cab signaling, which is a legal requirement in the UK for trains to be permitted to operate at speeds greater than 125 mph due to the impracticality of observing lineside signals at such speeds.|$|R

5|$|During 1943, Bulleid began {{planning}} for the post-war locomotive requirements of the railway and identified {{the need for a}} stop-gap steam locomotive design for those <b>main</b> <b>lines</b> in South East England scheduled for electrification, had the Second World War not taken place. Although the new Merchant Navy class was available for the heaviest Continental expresses, the resumption of frequent passenger services over poorly maintained infrastructure, following the war, would require a lighter locomotive with wider route availability.|$|E
5|$|In the {{database}} of the website ChessGames.com, the Budapest Gambit scores 28.9% Black wins, 44.1% White wins and 27.1% draws. The percentage of draws is especially {{low compared to}} mainstream alternatives such as 2...e6 (43.7% draws) or 2...g6 (37% draws). This opening gives more chance to win for both opponents, although the percentage of Black wins is still lower than the alternative 2...c5. In the main line 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Bf4 the percentage of Black wins already falls to 21.1%, lower than the <b>main</b> <b>lines</b> after 2...e6 or 2...g6.|$|E
5|$|In the {{operation}} the 6th Airborne Division {{together with the}} 7th Armoured Division, the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division and the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, formed the I Corps, attached to the First Canadian Army. When issuing his orders, Lieutenant General John Crocker, the Corps commander, aware that the 6th Airborne had almost no artillery, vehicles or engineer equipment, did not expect them to advance quickly. To reach the River Seine the division would have to cross three main rivers, along only two <b>main</b> <b>lines</b> of advance. One route was in the north, running along the French coast, while the other route was further inland between Troarn and Pont Audemer.|$|E

5|$|The {{corridor}} for {{the northern}} segment was first used by the Nevada-California-Oregon Railway, a line also started in 1880, at Reno, {{to connect with the}} Great Northern Railway in Oregon. This line also was never completed, ending at Lakeview, Oregon. A portion of this line is still active, through a series of acquisitions, the Union Pacific Railroad now owns this line. The portion from Reno to Hallelujah Junction is used as a connection between the Union Pacific's two <b>main</b> <b>lines</b> in northern California/Nevada, the Overland Route (First Transcontinental Railroad) and the Feather River Route.|$|E
5|$|The {{prospectus}} {{outlined the}} NSR's plans for two <b>main</b> <b>lines.</b> The Pottery Line running from a junction with the Manchester & Birmingham railway at Congleton to the Grand Junction Railway at Colwich was promoted, as 'giving the most ample accommodation to {{the towns of}} Tunstall, Burslem, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Hanley, Stoke, Fenton, Longton and Stone'. The Churnet Line was to run from Macclesfield though Leek, Cheadle and Uttoxeter to join the Midland Railway line between Burton-upon-Trent and Derby forming a direct link between Manchester and Derby.|$|E
5|$|With {{the coming}} upgrade to the Great Western Main Line, {{the main line}} from London to Bristol is due to be {{electrified}} by 2016. However, the electrification will not extend beyond the <b>main</b> <b>lines,</b> so Avonmouth {{will continue to be}} served by diesel trains. Stephen Williams, MP for Bristol West; and the group Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways support the electrification being extended to the Severn Beach Line.|$|E

5|$|As {{members of}} the Uand U1classes, rebuilds were used mainly on mixed-traffic as well as {{secondary}} passenger duties on lines between the main routes. They were used all over the Southern Railway network, but were little-used over the steep track gradients west of Exeter. The smaller-wheeled Nclass was preferred amongst crews for the same duties, as high-speed running was rare away from the <b>main</b> <b>lines</b> in the West Country. Heavier passenger work was allocated to Bulleid's Unrebuilt Light Pacifics, which were within weight restrictions in this area. The 21 rebuilt locomotives entered British Railways service in 1948. From 1955 a few were given replacement frames at overhaul: these had a shallower curve between the front buffer beam and the smokebox.|$|E
5|$|During {{the latter}} half of the eighth century, the Northumbrian {{succession}} included a long series of murdered and deposed kings, as several royal lines contended for the throne. The <b>main</b> <b>lines</b> were those of Eadberht, Æthelwald Moll and Alhred. In the eight years before Eardwulf's accession, all three of these dynastic lines were involved in the struggle for kingship: on 23 September 788, King Ælfwald I, grandson of Eadberht, was murdered by the patricius Sicga near Hexham, and Ælfwald's cousin Osred became king. Osred, who was of Alhred's line, was deposed after a year, and Æthelred, son of Æthelwald Moll, who had been deposed in 778 at a young age, was restored to the kingship, resuming the title Æthelred I.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>main</b> <b>lines</b> the pawn push c4–c5 often brings {{positional}} gains to White. In the Rubinstein variation 3...Ng4 4.Bf4 with 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.a3, after 7...Ngxe5 8.Nxe5 Nxe5 9.e3 Bxd2+ 10.Qxd2 (see diagram at right) White {{gets the}} bishop pair and a space advantage. In {{order to build}} up on these potential advantages, the most common plan is to perform a minority attack on the queenside, {{with the goal of}} performing the pawn advance c4–c5 in favourable conditions. This push can yield several advantages to White: it enhances the prospects of the light-square bishop, it creates a half-open file to attack with the rooks, and it creates an isolated, backward pawn on d6 after the exchange c5xd6.|$|E
