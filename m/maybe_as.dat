5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{history of this}} group is not well documented, but the known fossils allow some preliminary conclusions: the earliest known modern picids were piculet-like forms of the Late Oligocene, about 25 million years ago (mya). By that time, however, the group was already present in the Americas and Europe, and it is hypothesized that they actually evolved much earlier, <b>maybe</b> <b>as</b> early as the Early Eocene (50 mya). The modern subfamilies appear to be rather young by comparison; until the mid-Miocene (10–15 mya), all picids {{seem to have been}} small or mid-sized birds similar to a mixture between a piculet and a wryneck. On the other hand, there exists a feather enclosed in fossil amber from the Dominican Republic, dated to about 25 mya, which seems to indicate that the Nesoctitinae were already a distinct lineage by then.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Chivington and 425 {{men of the}} 3rd Colorado Cavalry rode to Fort Lyon {{arriving}} on November 28, 1864. Once at the Fort, Chivington took command of 250 men of the 1st Colorado Cavalry and <b>maybe</b> <b>as</b> many as 12 men of the 1st Regiment New Mexico Volunteer Infantry then set out for Black Kettle's encampment. James Beckwourth, noted frontiersman, acted as guide for Chivington. The following morning, Chivington gave the order to attack. Two officers, Captain Silas Soule and Lieutenant Joseph Cramer, commanding Company D and Company K of the First Colorado Cavalry, refused to obey and told their men to hold fire.|$|E
25|$|It {{is known}} that Li Luoneng was {{proficient}} in other martial arts before studying Dai clan's Xin Yi. Some claim his original art was Qimen Quan (奇门拳), perhaps his family's style, while others believe he actually studied Tongbei Quan and Gongli Quan. Li came to study under the Dai family either because he heard of their fame in the martial arts and business, or <b>maybe</b> <b>as</b> suggested by others, after having fought and lost to a practitioner of their art. It is generally agreed he then settled {{in the area of}} their village, and grew and sold vegetables, which earned him the nickname 'Li Lao Nong' 李老农 (Old Farmer Li, but also 'Respectable Farmer Li'). Initially, members of the Dai clan refused to teach him, but he eventually won over their trust, and he was taught by Dai Wenxiong, Guo Weihan, or both. After learning Dai Xin Yi for a number of years, perhaps over a decade, Li left the Dai territories and traveled across Shanxi and Hebei provinces, teaching for many years his own elaboration on the art, now called 'Xing Yi Quan'. No reasons were ever recorded for the many changes Li made to the art, but there are those who claim that Li wished to compete with the Dai clan's fame, perhaps because of some grudge. Li and many of his students and grand-students were famous for offering bodyguard and caravan escort services.|$|E
500|$|Twelve of Stillman's militia {{were killed}} in the melee. A band of volunteers under the {{leadership}} of Captain John Giles Adams made a stand on a hill south of the main militia camp. The men fought by moonlight as {{the main body of the}} militia fled back to Dixon. The entire 12-man detachment, including Adams, was killed in the fight. Dyer has said that Adams may have been killed by his own men as he attempted to muster them to battle. The number of Sauk and Fox killed in the engagement is largely unknown; the militia party that was sent to locate the [...] "missing" [...] 53 militia men found no dead Sauk.

500|$|Although {{the motivations}} of those Australians that volunteered {{to serve in}} Russia can really only be guessed at, they seem {{unlikely}} to have been political. <b>Maybe,</b> <b>as</b> one historian has suggested, [...] "a few had not seen enough fighting, or perhaps had seen too much." [...] Regardless they confirmed the Australians' reputation for audacity and courage, winning the only two Victoria Crosses of the land campaign. However, as the Australian government had refused flatly to supply forces for the intervention, their involvement was limited. Indeed, Australian involvement in North Russia was a minor episode in its history, and was barely noticed in Australia at the time. Ultimately {{it made no difference}} to the outcome of the Russian Civil War either, perhaps other than to help confirm the Bolshevik's mistrust of the Western powers. Total Australian casualties included 10 killed and 40 wounded, with most deaths being from disease during the Mesopotamian operations.|$|E

2500|$|According to Anthony, steppe herders, archaic Proto-Indo-European speakers, {{spread into}} the lower Danube valley about 4200-4000 BC, either causing or taking {{advantage}} of the collapse of Old Europe.

[...] Their descendants later moved into Anatolia at an unknown time but <b>maybe</b> <b>as</b> early as 3000 BC. According to J. P. Mallory {{it is likely that the}} Anatolians reached the Near East from the north either via the Balkans or the Caucasus in the 3rd millennium BC. According to Parpola, the appearance of Indo-European speakers from Europe into Anatolia, and the appearance of Hittite, is related to later migrations of Proto-Indo-European speakers from the Yamna-culture into the Danube Valley at ca. 2800 BC, which is in line with the [...] "customary" [...] assumption that the Anatolian Indo-European language was introduced into Anatolia somewhere in the third millennium BC.|$|E
2500|$|The haibutsu kishaku {{during the}} Meiji Restoration, {{the most famous}} {{instance}} of the phenomenon, was an event triggered by the official policy of separation of Shinto and Buddhism (or shinbutsu bunri) [...] that after 1868 caused great damage to Buddhism in Japan. The destruction of Buddhist property took place {{on a large scale}} all over the country. For example, Kōfuku-ji in Nara suffered greatly. The temple, which is now a National Treasure, was hit with full force by the movement. The temple's land was seized, the priests forced to become Shinto priests, walls were torn down, trees were planted, and the area became part of one of the city's parks. The anti-Buddhist riots caused damage to all large temples of the city. The violence marked permanently every region of the country. Between 1872 and 1874, 18 thousand temples were eradicated, and <b>maybe</b> <b>as</b> many again from 1868 to 1872. Japanologist Martin Collcutt believes Japanese Buddhism {{was on the verge of}} total eradication.|$|E
