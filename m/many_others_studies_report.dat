Mutations in these two genes are observed in 15 – 20 % of hereditary breast cancer cases but less than 5 % of overall breast cancer cases [1, 2]. Most BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 gene aberrations are small mutations involving a single or mul-tiple changes in nucleotide sequence, but large genomic rearrangements (LGRs) have also been reported in pa-tients who are negative for BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 sequence variations. The prevalence of LGRs varies according to the ethnicity and selection criteria of the study population [3, 4]. In certain studies conducted in the Netherlands and Italy, it was shown that in breast and/or ovarian cancer patients who tested negative for BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 small mutations, about 20 % carried an LGR in 1 of these 2 genes [5, 6], but <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>studies</b> <b>reported</b> a prevalence of under 10 % [7, 8].

The current study aimed at investigating the role of both non-symbolic and symbolic processing in children’s arithmetic development. Two-hundred and one Chinese kindergarten children, with a mean age of 6 years and 1 month, were assessed on their symbolic skills (counting and estimation), non-symbolic skills (number acuity), and arithmetic skills. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The final model, which has a good fit of the data (X 2 = 20. 634, CFI=. 994, RMSEA=. 021), suggested that non-symbolic processing predicted concurrent arithmetic performance indirectly through symbolic processing. The present findings support the role of ANS on human’s arithmetic skills and provide a potential reason for the insignificant results found in previous studies.

40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study how upper {{secondary}} school students (grade 10 - 12) {{develop an understanding of}} evolutionary biology as a result of teaching. Taking students’ preconceptions as the starting point a teaching sequence is designed with the aim that students shall learn the theory of evolution by natural selection {{in such a way that}} it becomes an intellectual tool. In other words they shall be able to describe, understand, explain, and partly predict biological phenomena from an evolutionary point of view. Three different teaching experiments were performed and studied in a cyclic process with design and evaluation of both teaching and students’ learning, followed by a new design and so on. The students’ knowing was tested before, during, and after teaching by written tests, interviews, small group discussions, and a database-driven Internet problem. Similar results emerge from the analyses of the students’ performances in the different data collections: e. g. all students do not accept random processes before teaching, many students use the same alternative ideas, and existing variation is a key idea to understand the theory of evolution, and to reason scientifically. The majority of the students, about 80 %, had alternative ideas about evolution before teaching. They viewed evolution as a gradual process where every member of the population adapts to the environment. They consider adaptation as the driving force that is regulated by, for instance need, strive, or purpose. In the delayed post-test one year after teaching most students, about 75 %, had reached a scientific level. This result can be considered good compared to <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>studies</b> <b>reported</b> in the literature. The students’ reasoning in the different tests was carefully analysed having preconceptions, the conceptual structure of the theory of evolution, and the aims of teaching in mind. This gave insights into those learning and teaching demands that constitutes challenges to students as well as to teachers, when beginning to learn, or to teach evolutionary biology. The combined results from these analyses of the three experiments are summarized in a domain specific hypothesis for teaching. It consists of three different aspects: content specific aspects, which are unique for every field of science, aspects concerning the nature of science, and general aspects. This hypothesis can be tested in new design experiments, and if it will withstand future tests it can be developed into a domain specific theory for teaching evolutionary biology...|$|R

This recent publication does raise a few questions {{with regard to the}} different results acquired by the authors compared with recent publications by others. 2, 3 The first point of note is that the experience from the JWCI goes back to 1991; this is an advantage, because this leads to a longer median follow-up compared with <b>other</b> single-center <b>studies.</b> 2, 3 However, at the same time, it means that patients from the early days of SN staging have been included.

40|$|Tissue {{angiotensin}} generation {{depends on}} the uptake of circulating (kidney-derived) renin and/or its precursor prorenin [together denoted as (pro) renin]. Since tissue renin levels are usually somewhat higher than expected based upon the amount of (renin-containing) blood in tissue, an active uptake mechanism has been proposed. Several candidates have been evaluated {{in the past three}} decades, including a renin-binding protein, the mannose 6 -phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor and the (pro) renin receptor. Although the latter seemed the most promising, its nanomolar affinity for renin and prorenin is several orders of magnitude above their actual (picomolar) levels in blood, raising doubt on whether (pro) renin-(pro) renin receptor interaction will ever occur in vivo. A wide range of in vitro studies have now demonstrated (pro) renin-receptor-induced effects at nanomolar renin and prorenin concentrations, resulting in a profibrotic phenotype. In addition, beneficial in vivo effects of the putative (pro) renin receptor blocker HRP (handle region peptide) have been observed, particularly in diabetic animal models. Despite these encouraging results, <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>studies</b> have <b>reported</b> either no or even contrasting effects of HRP, and (pro) reninreceptor-knockout studies revealed lethal consequences that are (pro) renin-independent, most probably {{due to the fact that}} the (pro) renin receptor co-localizes with vacuolar H + -ATPase and possibly determines the stability of this vital enzyme. The present review summarizes all of the recent findings on the (pro) renin receptor and its blockade, and critically compares it with the other candidates that have been proposed to mediate (pro) renin uptake from blood. It ends with the conclusion that the (pro) renin-(pro) renin receptor interaction, if it occurs in vivo, is limited to (pro) renin-synthesizing organs such as the kidney...|$|R
40|$|The use of SiGe/Si heterostructures in the {{fabrication}} of electronic devices {{results in an}} improvement of the device performances with respect to bulk silicon. Ion implantation has been proposed {{as one of the}} possible technologies to produce these structures and, thus, the aim of this work is to develop an ion beam technology to fabricate strained SiGe heterostructures. The formation of extended defects in SiGe alloy layers formed by high dose Ge+ ion implantation followed by Solid Phase Epitaxial Growth (SPEG) has been investigated by transmission electron microscopy. Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy has also been used to determine the chemical composition and the crystalline quality of the synthesised structures. In addition, X-ray diffraction has been used to evaluate the strain level in selected samples. Two different structures have been studied in this project. The first consisted of "all-implanted" layers, where the Ge+ implants were followed in some cases by additional implants of Si+ and/or C+ ions, prior to SPEG, to investigate methods to inhibit defect formation. The second was achieved by capping the ion beam synthesised SiGe alloy layer by the deposition of a thin film of silicon, in order to realise structures compatible with device dimensions. Single crystal device worthy SiGe alloy layers have been achieved by implantation of Ge+ ions at energies ranging from 70 keV to 400 keV, where the only extended defects observed are EOR defects at a depth correspondent to the a/c interface formed during the Ge+ implant. In some cases, "hairpin" dislocations have also been observed {{in the vicinity of the}} EOR defects and extending up to the surface. Both types of defects are annihilated after post-amorphisation with 500 keV Si+ and replaced with dislocation loops at a depth of about 1 fj,m. For each Ge+ implantation energy a critical value of the peak germanium concentration exists above which the structures relax through the formation of stacking faults or "hairpin" dislocations nucleated in the vicinity of the peak of the germanium concentration depth profile and extending up to the surface. A critical value of the elastic energy stored in the structures (~ 300 mJ/m 2) has been determined above which ion beam synthesised SiGe alloys relax, independently of the implantation energy. This empirical approach has been found to successfully account for the results obtained in this work as well as in <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>studies</b> <b>reported</b> in the literature. "Hairpin" dislocations formed under different experimental conditions have been investigated by plan view TEM and have been found to have the same crystallographic orientation () and Burgers vector (b= a). Their formation has been explained within a "strain relaxation model". For a regrowth temperature of 700 ° C, all samples investigated by XRD have been found to be almost fully strained, including samples containing relaxation-induced defects, indicating that, under these conditions, the energy transferred to the defects is very low. C+ co-implantation has been successfully used to reduce both relaxation-induced defects and EOR dislocation loops. It is noted that a mixed technology entailing both layer deposition and ion implantation to produce the Si/SiGe/Si device structures requires extra process steps to control surface contaminations, pre cleaning and/or native oxide formation, resulting in increased fabrication costs. In this work an " all-implanted" route to the synthesis of Si/SiGe/Si device structures is therefore described, which exploits all of the advantages given by ion implantation...|$|R

Although the focus of published studies has been largely on septic patients, <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>studies</b> have <b>reported</b> serial blood lactate levels in different groups of acutely ill patients. Methods: We performed a systematic search of PubMed, Science Direct, and Embase {{until the end of}} February 2016 plus reference lists of relevant publications. We selected all observational and interventional studies that evaluated the capacity of serial blood lactate concentrations to predict outcome. There was no restriction based on language. We excluded studies in pediatric populations, experimental studies, and studies that did not report changes in lactate values or all-cause mortality rates. We separated studies according to the type of patients included. We collected data on the number of patients, timing of lactate measurements, minimum lactate level needed for inclusion if present, and suggested time interval for predictive use. Results: A total of 96 studies met our criteria: 14 in general ICU populations, five in general surgical ICU populations, five in patients post cardiac surgery, 14 in trauma patients, 39 in patients with sepsis, four in patients with cardiogenic shock, eight in patients after cardiac arrest, three in patients with respiratory failure, and four in other conditions. A decrease in lactate levels over time was consistently associated with lower mortality rates in all subgroups of patients. Most <b>studies</b> <b>reported</b> changes over 6, 12 or 24 hrs, fewer used shorter time intervals. Lactate kinetics did not appear very different in patients with sepsis and other types of patients. A few studies suggested that therapy could be guided by these measurements. Conclusions: The observation of a better outcome associated with decreasing blood lactate concentrations was consistent throughout the clinical studies, and was not limited to septic patients. In all groups, the changes are relatively slow, so that lactate measurements every 1 - 2 hrs are probably sufficient in most acute conditions. The value of lactate kinetics appears to be valid regardless of the initial value. SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Prolonged, {{extensive}} {{exposure to}} hand-transmitted vibration {{could cause a}} series of vibration-induced disorders in the vascular, sensorineural, and musculoskeletal structures of the human hand-arm system, which have been collectively called hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). 1 To assess the risk of HAVS the international standard ISO 5349 - 1 (2001) 1 recommends using the root-mean-square (rms) acceleration of the measured vibration with a frequency weighting. While a few epidemiological <b>studies</b> have <b>reported</b> results consistent with the predictions made according to the recommendation, <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>studies</b> have <b>reported</b> results with large discrepancies. 2 This may be partially attributed to the time-averaging effect involved in calculation of the frequency components, especially for impact type tools. Because the spectral characteristics of impact tools change dramatically with time, a time-frequency (T-F) analysis can provide better characterizations of such highly transient vibrations. The analytic wavelet transform (AWT) is an ideal T-F analysis tool because it possesses the advantages of both the Fourier transform and the wavelet transform. 3 The objective {{of this study was}} to explore the application of the AWT method for characterizing the impact tool vibrations and assessing their exposure risk. Methods Five tools (two chipping hammers, two riveting hammers, and one concrete cutting saw) were used in this study. The saw vibration was measured when it was used to cut a section of road pavement during a repair. The vibrations on the other tools were measured by the procedure specified in ISO 8662 - 2 (1992). 4 A sampling rate of 16, 386 Hz was used in the measurement. The AWT and Fourier analysis were applied to these signals and to identify their characteristics. Results Figure 1 compares the T-F characteristics of the accelerations measured from the relatively steady concrete saw and a riveting hammer. The frequency weighting specified in ISO 5349 - 11 was applied in the calculations. The comparison clearly shows that the two tools have completely different T-F characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The Kelvin-Helmoltz {{instability}} (KH) with {{formation of}} vortices {{appears in a}} wide variety of terrestrial, interplanetary, and astrophysical contexts. We study a series of iterated rolled-up coherent plasma structures (15) that flow in the equatorial Earth's boundary layer (BL), observed on October 24, 2001. The data were recorded during a 1. 5 hour-long Wind crossing of the BL at the dawn magnetospheric flank, tailward of the terminator (X≈- 13 RE). The interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) was radially directed, almost antiparallel to the magnetosheath (MS) flow. This configuration is expected to be adverse to the KH instability because of the collinearity of field and flow, and the high compressibility of the MS. We analyze the BL stability with compressible MHD theory using continuous profiles for the physical quantities. Upstream, at near Earth sites, we input parameters derived from an exact MHD solution for collinear flows. Further downtail at Wind position we input measured parameters. The BL is found KH unstable in spite of unfavorable features of the external flow. On the experimental side, the passage of vortices is inferred from the presence of low density - hot plasma being accelerated to speeds higher than that of the contiguous MS. It is further supported by the peculiar correlation of relative motions (in the bulk velocity frame) : cold-dense plasma drifts sunward, while hot-tenuous plasma moves tailward. This event differs from <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>studies</b> that <b>reported</b> BL vortices under strongly northward IMF orientations.

The full Australian report is called Challenges for Australian Education: Results from PISA 2009, and is available from [URL] PISA 2009 assessed students’ capacities to apply knowledge and skills in reading, mathematical and scientific literacy. More assessment time was given to reading literacy, as this was the main focus for this cycle. Reading literacy was also the focus of PISA 2000, which allows us to make comparisons of reading performance between 2000 and 2009. In 2003 and 2006, more time was devoted to assessing mathematical and scientific skills and knowledge respectively. In 2012, the focus will again be on mathematical literacy and any changes over time will be able to be monitored. In this way, PISA provides regular information on educational outcomes within and across countries. It provides insight into the range of skills and competencies in different assessment domains that are considered to be essential to an individuals’ ability to participate in and contribute fully to society, particularly a society that experiences rapid technological change. PISA, like <b>many</b> <b>other</b> international <b>studies,</b> <b>reports</b> results as mean scores – a measure of average performance – along with various statistics that reflect the distribution of performance.

This performance scale is divided into levels of difficulty, or ‘proficiency levels’. Students who have reached a particular proficiency level not only typically demonstrate the knowledge and skills associated with that level, but also the proficiencies required at lower levels. A student who performs at proficiency level 4, for example, is expected to show all the skills and knowledge of Levels 2 and 3, {{and to be able to}} complete any assessment tasks that are illustrative of those proficiency levels...|$|R
40|$|Arctic and alpine {{ecosystems}} are experiencing {{fundamental changes in}} vegetation composition due to increasing temperatures. One of the most palpable of these changes is the expansion of shrubs on the treeless tundra, which has been reported from many sites throughout the Arctic. An increase in tall deciduous shrub cover has been hypothesized to have profound implications for ecosystem processes, e. g. through increasing snow trapping in winter, which can raise soil temperatures and accelerate nutrient turnover rates. In spring, taller shrub canopies can lower albedo and speed up spring thaw, thus prolonging the growing season. An increase in low evergreen shrubs, on the other hand, may decrease turnover rates through the production of more recalcitrant litter. The effect of herbivory on different shrub species may therefore be of major importance. The aim of this thesis was to investigate how vegetation {{has changed in the}} Scandes forest-tundra ecotone {{over the past two decades}} and how large herbivores have influenced these changes. 16 -year old reindeer exclosures, in several different vegetation types in the Scandes mountain range, were used to study how plant community composition, mycelia production and nutrient allocation patterns within plants were affected by grazing. The comparative effects of reindeer and hare browsing on tall shrubs were also examined. Low evergreen shrubs, such as mountain crowberry and heather, had increased dramatically at both shrub heath and mountain birch forest sites, and were not influenced by large herbivores. Deciduous shrub cover, mainly consisting of dwarf birch, had increased to a far lesser extent but was significantly greater and taller inside exclosures. Tall shrub cover was, in turn, negatively correlated with summer soil temperatures, while winter soil temperatures tended to be higher in exclosures. Despite this, no effects of grazing on diversity were found. At a grass heath site, a similar expansion of ericoid shrubs was seen, whereas at a more productive low herb meadow, grazer exclusion had triggered an advancement of willow species, which had grown tall inside the exclosures. Outside the exclosures, low evergreen shrubs had increased, suggesting that, in the absence of herbivores, this group was outcompeted by tall deciduous shrubs. Furthermore, not only reindeer but also mountain hares were found to substantially affect tall shrubs. Apart from plant community composition, herbivory also affected carbon content and isotopic composition of a perennial herb, as well as the overall production of ectomycorrhizal mycelia. Surprisingly, contrasting effects on mycelia production were found in the mountain birch forest, where mycelia biomass was larger inside exclosures, and in the shrub heath, where mycelia biomass was larger outside exclosures. By holding back the expansion of deciduous shrubs, herbivores can decelerate turnover rates. Furthermore the increase in more recalcitrant litter and ericoid mycelia associated with evergreen shrubs may slow down nutrient cycling further. Hence, the unexpected finding that the major vegetation shift was an increase in ericoid shrubs, rather than tall deciduous shrubs as <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>studies</b> have <b>reported,</b> may have far-reaching consequences for ecosystem functioning and soil carbon stocks...|$|R
