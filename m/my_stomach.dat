500|$|Mays {{said that}} she [...] "had fun singing," [...] but found the {{experience}} [...] "terrifying," [...] as she had never given a musical performance on camera before. She derided her choreography skills, and elaborated: [...] "I was so nervous that day. I had to keep eating bread and toast because <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> was so sick. But {{it was an interesting}} experience. It was definitely a challenge for me. Of course if they ask me to do it again, I would do it again. But I’m not going to go begging them for it." ...|$|E
500|$|Immediately afterwards, Ulf Findeisen {{fell out}} of the air on his jump, {{crashing}} down face-first from 9 m and flipping head over heels repeatedly along the slope, only coming to a stop several seconds later. Al Trautwig, commentating for American TV network ABC, likened Findeisen to [...] "a ragdoll" [...] after the fall. Former ski jumper Jeff Hastings, co-commentating, said: [...] "I'm feeling a little sick to <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> Al... I can't believe this. I've never seen ski flying like this... So many falls." [...] Findeisen was barely conscious and had to be stretchered away, later going into cardiac arrest but surviving.|$|E

500|$|Asked in an {{interview}} if he ever worried about going broke, Keating responded, [...] "All the time, every day. I come into the office with this hollow feeling in <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> lots of time.... You get trapped almost. You get too many responsibilities. It's a bellyfull to carry. It's risky. Dangerous. There's the possibility of failure with it every day and every night. But in a way, it's a challenge. It's invigorating. There isn't any point in not being a player – you're here.... It's not only the money. It's the disgrace, yourself, your manhood. I'm not sure I'd have a big problem with that. On the other hand I'm not sure I wouldn't." ...|$|E
500|$|After the game, Gary Anderson was {{described}} as [...] "inconsolable." [...] Although the Vikings still led by seven points at the time, his missed kick had a demoralizing effect on the team. ESPN contributor Ben Goessling noted [...] "how swiftly it pulled the bottom {{out from under a}} team that had an air of inevitability about it to that point." [...] Writing for the website Sporting News, Jeff Diamond, the Vikings' general manager in 1998, observed that, [...] "Our team played the rest of the game as if it was in shock that our automatic kicker had missed at the most critical time." [...] Randle concurred, describing his reaction to the kick as, [...] "I was standing there like someone just punched me in <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> and was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Atkinson {{has said}} that in the buildup to the final episode, he began to psychologically {{experience}} something of his character's apprehension. Speaking to Michael Parkinson in 2003, he recalled [...] "I remember...in {{the weeks leading up to}} the one day recording of that final episode when we went over the top, for the first time in my acting career...knowing that even though the rest of the episode was its usual standard funny sitcom self, there was this deep twist in <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> throughout that week thinking along with your character that you were doomed. It was most peculiar. I'm sure serious character actors feel this all the time... Obviously if you're trying to feel the character and his dilemma then you're going to experience some of the fictional feelings for real. You felt swept along by it." ...|$|E

[...] Of the car chases, Tarantino stated, [...] "CGI for car stunts doesn't make any sense to me—how is that supposed to be impressive? [...] I don't think there have been any good car chases since I started making films in '92—to me, the last terrific car chase was in Terminator 2. And Final Destination 2 had a magnificent car action piece. In between that, not a lot. Every time a stunt happens, there's twelve cameras and they use every angle for Avid editing, but I don't feel it in <b>my</b> <b>stomach.</b> It's just action." ...|$|E
500|$|Unavailable {{for several}} months, Bjørnebye {{appeared}} just twice for Liverpool in the 1995–96 season. Recovery and injuries to other left back candidates enabled Bjørnebye to reclaim his place the following season, {{in which he}} scored his first goal for Liverpool on 17 August 1996 in a 3–3 draw against Middlesbrough. He contributed to the club's most convincing title challenge {{since the inception of}} the Premier League by supplying club strikers Stan Collymore and Robbie Fowler with precise crosses. He was ultimately included in the PFA Team of the Year with Steve McManaman and Mark Wright. The acquisition of Steve Staunton and arrival of Gérard Houllier in the 1998–99 season, limited Bjørnebye's first-team opportunities, leading to his effective marginalisation. Bjørnebye affirmed his recurring determination to stay at Liverpool that season, remarking [...] "If I didn't have any fight in <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> I'd have left Liverpool at least three times before".|$|E
500|$|Eric Crookshank, {{who had his}} jersey retired {{while playing}} for Halifax, said that the {{prospect}} of having the organization fold was [...] "sad." [...] He also said, [...] "If what these players are saying is true it’s very hurtful to me. It sickening to <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> that the players say they didn't get paid or they got kicked out of their living arrangements." [...] Joey Haywood criticized the league for not having a players' union or commissioner, with [...] "owners acting like commissioners." [...] He also condemned Levingston for not standing up for his players. On May 7, Clarós issued an open letter to the City of Halifax and the fans of the Rainmen. In a paragraph about the forfeit, he wrote, [...] "At this time, we don't know what the future holds. But there is one thing we know for sure. That when a group of good people unite to take a stand in the name of safety, good values, people’s rights and strong principles, that this will rise above any rules or even winning." ...|$|E

500|$|Barkley is {{an outspoken}} {{supporter}} of gay rights. In 2006, he told Fox Sports: [...] "I'm a big advocate of gay marriage. If {{they want to}} get married, God bless them." [...] Speaking to Wolf Blitzer on CNN two years later, he said: [...] "Every time I hear the word 'conservative,' it makes me sick to <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> because they're really just fake Christians, as I call them. That's all they are. ... I think they want to be judge and jury. Like, I'm for gay marriage. It's none of my business if gay people want to get married. I'm pro-choice. And I think these Christians, first of all, they're not supposed to judge other people. But they're the most hypocritical judge of people we have in the country. And it bugs the hell out of me. They act like they're Christians. They're not forgiving at all." [...] During a 2011 Martin Luther King, Jr. Day double-header on TNT, Barkley responded to a statement made by Dr. King's daughter Bernice, by saying, [...] "People try to make it about black and white. [...] he talked about equality for every man, every woman. We have a thing going on now, people discriminating against homosexuality in this country. I love the homosexuality people. God bless the gay people. They are great people." ...|$|E
500|$|Critic Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film 3.5 stars out of 4 {{and called it}} [...] "painfully and unremittingly intense" [...] and a [...] "superb example of filmmaking craft." [...] He also stated [...] "when I {{walked out of the}} theater, there were knots in <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> from the film's roller-coaster ride of violence." [...] Walter Goodman of The New York Times said it was a [...] "flaming, flashing, crashing, {{crackling}} blow-'em-up show that keeps you popping from your seat despite your better instincts and the basically conventional scare tactics." [...] Time magazine featured the film on the cover of its , 1986, issue, calling it the [...] "summer's scariest movie". Time reviewer Richard Schickel declared the film [...] "a sequel that exceeds its predecessor in the reach of its appeal while giving Weaver new emotional dimensions to explore." [...] The selection of Aliens for a Time cover was attributed to the successful reception of the film, as well as its novel example of a science fiction action heroine. Echoing Times assessment, Dave Kehr of The Chicago Reader called the film [...] "one sequel that surpasses the original." [...] On the negative side, Gene Siskel described Aliens as [...] "one extremely violent, protracted attack on the senses" [...] and that [...] "toward the end, the film resorts to placing a young girl in jeopardy in a pathetic attempt to pander to who knows what audience. Some people have praised the technical excellence of Aliens. Well, the Eiffel Tower is technically impressive, but I wouldn't want to watch it fall apart on people for two hours." ...|$|E

She also complained of strip searches, tight handcuffing, door kicking, frequent window checks, low water pressure, mildew on her mattress, and [...] "cat calling ... in distaste and a pure hatred towards me". Wuornos threatened to boycott showers and food trays when certain officers were on duty. [...] "In the meantime, <b>my</b> <b>stomach's</b> growling away and I'm taking showers through the sink of my cell."

I felt really violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns in <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere.
