5|$|Truman {{surrounded}} {{himself with}} his old friends, and appointed several to high positions that seemed well beyond their competence, including his two secretaries of the treasury, Fred Vinson and John Snyder.

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{overcome}} this compartmentalization, Andrews bypassed {{the chain of command}} on 8 January 1938, in a memorandum of his own regarding a minor joint air exercise held in November 1937 off the Virginia Capes. There four B-17s had found and successfully bombed Navy target vessels. Andrews sent a memo directly to Roosevelt's <b>military</b> <b>aide,</b> Col. Edwin M. Watson, that included confidential Navy memoranda confirming the accuracy of the Army's bombing.|$|E
5|$|Alan Brooke, {{commander}} of the British II Corps sought to put the matter of cooperation right with King Leopold. The King discussed the matter with Brooke, who felt a compromise could be reached. Van Overstraeten, the King's <b>military</b> <b>aide,</b> stepped in {{and said that the}} 10th Belgian Infantry Division could not be moved. Instead, the British should move further south and remain completely clear of Brussels. Brooke told the King that the 10th Belgian Division was {{on the wrong side of}} the Gamelin line and was exposed. Leopold deferred to his advisor and chief of staff. Brooke found Overstaeten to be ignorant of the situation and the dispositions of the BEF. Given that the left flank of the BEF rested on its Belgian ally, the British were now unsure about Belgian military capabilities.|$|E

50|$|The <b>military</b> <b>aides</b> to the President {{number five}} (one {{from each of}} the armed services), and they are majors and {{lieutenant}} colonels (in the Army, Marine Corps and Air Force). Navy and Coast Guard <b>military</b> <b>aides</b> to the President hold the rank of lieutenant commander or commander. One of their major roles is to hold the Presidential emergency satchel. There are, in addition to these five permanent aides-de-camp, some 40-45 <b>military</b> social <b>aides,</b> who are more junior (lieutenant to major) and are temporary officers whose appointment is, as their titles suggest, for social purposes (primarily as hosts at the White House). They are part-time, required for perhaps 2-4 afternoons a month.|$|R

5|$|Because the Manhattan Project was an Allied endeavor, Groves had {{to obtain}} {{permission}} from the British and American governments to publish the Smyth Report. A meeting was held on August 2, 1945 {{in the office of}} the Secretary of War, Henry Stimson. Accompanying Stimson were his two assistants, Harvey Bundy and George L. Harrison, and his <b>military</b> <b>aide,</b> Colonel William H. Kyle. Groves, Conant, and Tolman represented the Manhattan Project. James Chadwick, the head of the British scientific mission to the Manhattan Project, and Roger Makins from the British Embassy represented Britain. The meeting went on for two hours, as Groves and Conant sought to reassure Stimson that the report would not give vital secrets away to the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|On May 5, {{the same}} day that Davis officially {{dissolved}} the Confederate Government in Washington, Georgia, Breckinridge discharged most of the men escorting him, retaining only a small contingent of Kentuckians under the command of his cousin, William Campbell Preston Breckinridge. Feeling honor bound to protect Davis, he attempted to create a diversion that would allow him to escape. The next day, his party encountered a large Federal force; while his cousin negotiated with the force's commander, Breckinridge and a small detachment escaped. Riding southward across Georgia, they reached Milltown (now Lakeland) by May 11 and remained there for a few days. Learning of Davis's capture, he left Milltown with only a <b>military</b> <b>aide,</b> a personal servant, and his son Cabell. On May 15, 1865, in Madison, Florida, he was joined by fellow fugitive John Taylor Wood, who had been a captain in the Confederate Navy. Breckinridge and Wood decided to flee to the Bahamas, but because Cabell was allergic to mosquito bites, Breckinridge told him to surrender to the nearest federal officer.|$|E

5000|$|His {{approach}} to this largely symbolic vice-regal role differed from his predecessor, Sir Brian Murray.

As the day progressed, minor revolts and military actions ensued, such as Castello Branco's barricades at the Ministry of War building, and at the , in Rio de Janeiro.

25|$|Meanwhile, in the 1960 presidential election, both main {{candidates}}, Richard Nixon of the Republican Party and John F. Kennedy of the Democratic Party, {{campaigned on}} the issue of Cuba, with both candidates taking a hardline stance on Castro. Nixon – who was then Vice President – sent a <b>military</b> <b>aide</b> to Dulles to ask how the planned invasion was progressing; he believed that it was taking too long, considering the swift preparation of the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'etat. Nixon insisted that Kennedy should not be informed of the military plans, to which Dulles conceded.|$|E
25|$|Walton {{also ordered}} the storm {{door at the}} {{entrance}} to the White House beneath the North Portico removed so that the coffin would pass more easily through the portal. The door was removed, but the frame (embedded in concrete) was not. Black crepe was tacked around the door to cover it. Shriver had the White House driveway lit with small firepots. Kennedy's body arrived at the White House at about 4:30 A.M. The military casket team moved the coffin into the East Room and set it on the catafalque. Walton gave General Godfrey McHugh, Kennedy's chief <b>military</b> <b>aide,</b> a spray of flowers to place at the long base of the catafalque.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. {{was also}} given decrypted {{messages}} by Dutch (NEI) intelligence, who {{like the others}} in the British–Dutch–U.S. agreement to share the cryptographic load, shared information with allies. However, the U.S. refused to do likewise. This was, at least in part, due to fears of compromise; sharing even between the US Navy and Army was restricted. The eventual flow of intercepted and decrypted information was tightly and capriciously controlled. At times, even President Roosevelt did not receive all information from code-breaking activities. There were fears of compromise as a result of poor security after a memo dealing with Magic was found in the desk of Brigadier General Edwin M. (Pa) Watson, the President's <b>military</b> <b>aide.</b>|$|E

50|$|De la Maza {{was born}} in Moca, Espaillat. His family had ties to Horacio Vásquez who was ousted by Trujillo when he started his reign in 1930.

25|$|Goulart's {{attempt to}} {{countermand}} the Generals was disastrous. Two {{of his three}} military chiefs of staff were out of action for various reasons. His personal <b>military</b> <b>aide</b> was a newly promoted Brigadier General, General Assis Brasil. His greatest base of military support was located in his native Southern Brazil. His reaction, orchestrated by Assis Brasil, consisted of shifting a general from the southern 3rd Army to the southeast, to replace Castello Branco (he never arrived). Of his other generals, in the states of Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul, four were on vacation, while two others were returning to their posts in Curitiba when {{they were forced to}} land in Porto Alegre due to bad weather, and thus away from their commands.|$|E
25|$|Plans for {{erecting}} {{a memorial}} to Butt and Millet began shortly after {{the introduction of the}} Senate resolution. Taft agreed to chair the memorial committee.

Bell of the American Security and Trust Company was the treasurer. Members of the foreign diplomatic corps and several high government officials had already donated several thousand dollars to the memorial fund by mid-May. Taft himself had made the first contribution. At this point in time, The Ellipse (the southern part of President's Park) was chosen for the site of the memorial. However, the memorial committee was thinking only of erecting a bronze tablet.|$|E
25|$|In 1915, Ord was a <b>military</b> <b>aide</b> on {{the staff}} of the {{governor}} of Arizona. He was also a liaison with Army unit that included his former regiment. He saw service on the Mexican border due to the rise of tension along the border following the Battle of Agua Prieta. This was where Pancho Villa sustained his greatest defeat and his units were disorganized and wandered around northern Mexico foraging for supplies. Desperate for food and fresh horses, Pancho Villa camped his army of an estimated 500 horsemen outside of Columbus, New Mexico on the Mexican side of the border in March 1916. On March 9, 1916, he invaded the United States for supplies and arms which resulted in the Battle of Columbus. Ord had been given the rank of Major and served Arizona well in organizing and arming militia units. No major raids across the border took place in Arizona.|$|E

25|$|While the Hofgarten {{was then}} the only public park in Munich, {{that was not the}} primary {{motivation}} for the creation of the English Garden. Rather, {{it was part of a}} series of military reforms being pursued under the guidance of Sir Benjamin Thompson, the new Elector's chief <b>military</b> <b>aide,</b> later created Count Rumford and appointed as Bavarian war minister. Born in Massachusetts, Thompson had served on the Loyalist side in the American Revolutionary War, and after the British defeat had returned to England before moving to continental Europe and entering Charles Theodore's service in 1784. In 1788 Thompson proposed that in peacetime the majority of the soldiers of the Elector's army should be given leave to do civilian work, such as farming and gardening. In February 1789, Charles Theodore decreed that military gardens should be laid out in each garrison city, to provide soldiers with good agricultural knowledge and also to serve as recreation areas, accessible also to the public.|$|E
25|$|In 1952 {{there was}} a {{significant}} increase in the number of UFO reports received by the USAF Blue Book project, tasked with investigating such reports at the time. This wave included widely reported incidents over Washington DC in July, over the weekends of July 19-20 and 26-27. CIA historian Gerald Haines noted “A massive build-up of sightings over the United States in 1952, especially in July, alarmed the Truman administration. On 19 and 20 July, radar scopes at Washington National Airport and Andrews Air Force Base tracked mysterious blips. On 27 July, the blips reappeared. The Air Force scrambled interceptor aircraft to investigate, but they found nothing. The incidents, however, caused headlines across the country. The White House wanted to know what was happening…”. The reference to White House interest is consistent with a telephone call Captain (later Major) Edward Ruppelt, Blue Book Project Director at the time, received from Brigadier General Landry, Truman’s <b>military</b> <b>aide,</b> on the July 28, inquiring as to the causes of the Washington reports of the previous days.|$|E
25|$|Joint Task Force 116, {{compiled}} from all {{branches of the}} U.S. military and based on Okinawa, had been alerted for action in Laos. Units of the Seventh Fleet were forwarded to the Gulf of Siam. At a 13 March 1961 meeting, President Kennedy approved recommendations made {{to him by the}} Joint Chiefs of Staff. The regnant materiel in the proposal was a small fleet of 16 B-26 light bombers, to be stationed in Thailand for aerial interdiction of communist supply lines in Laos. They were to be unmarked, and maintained by the CIA's wholly owned airline, Air America. Programs Evaluation Office officials had assured the president's <b>military</b> <b>aide</b> that the B-26s would suffice to chase the communists from the Plain of Jars. The B-26s would be accompanied by 16 Sikorsky H-34 helicopters, also for Air America use, also unmarked. Four C-130 Hercules, three Douglas DC-4s, and a Douglas C-47 were part of the anonymous package. The Royal Thai Army would covertly ship four batteries of 105mm howitzers to the Royal Lao Army. The existing advisory groups in Bangkok and Vientiane would be augmented with 100 more U.S. military men. Lastly, an additional 1,000 Hmong guerrillas would be trained by the CIA via Operation Momentum by 1 April. On 24 April, a RT-33 photo reconnaissance craft repurposed from the Philippine Air Force, but with a U.S. pilot, joined the effort under the code name Project Field Goal.|$|E
50|$|The {{football}} is carried {{by one of}} the rotating presidential <b>military</b> <b>aides,</b> whose work schedule is described by a top-secret rota (one from each of the five service branches). This person is a commissioned officer in the U.S. military, pay-grade O-4 or above, who has undergone the nation's most rigorous background check (Yankee White). These officers are required to keep the football readily accessible to the president at all times. Consequently, the aide, football in hand, is always either standing or walking near the president, including riding on Air Force One, Marine One, or the presidential motorcade with the president.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to President Magsaysay and Mata, the plane carried 24 others, including former Senator Tomas Cabili, {{a hero of}} the guerrilla resistance movement during World War II; Secretary of Education Gregorio Hernandez; Representative Pedro Lopez (1915–1957) of the 2nd District of Cebu; and General Benito Ebuen (1912–1957), commanding general of the Philippine Air Force. Also on board was former Olympian Felipe Nunag, then serving as an aide-de-camp to Magsaysay. The other passengers included various civilian and <b>military</b> <b>aides</b> to the President and three journalists. Speechwriter and presidential adviser Jesus Paredes, Jr., the father of singer Jim Paredes and journalist Ducky Paredes, was among those killed in the crash.|$|R
50|$|In medieval Europe, {{young boys}} from about {{twelve years of}} age were used as <b>military</b> <b>aides</b> ("squires"), though in theory their role in actual combat was limited. The {{so-called}} Children's Crusade in 1212 recruited thousands of children as untrained soldiers {{under the assumption that}} divine power would enable them to conquer the enemy, although none of the children actually entered combat; according to the legend, they were instead sold into slavery. While most scholars no longer believe that the Children's Crusade consisted solely, or even mostly, of children, it nonetheless exemplifies an era in which the entire family took part in a war effort.|$|R
