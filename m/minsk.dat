5|$|Russia {{received}} the Kiev Voivodeship, Bracław Voivodeship, Podole Voivodeship and <b>Minsk</b> Voivodeship, {{and parts of}} the Vilnius Voivodeship, Nowogródek Voivodeship, Brest Litovsk Voivodeship and the Volhynian Voivodeship. This was accepted by the Grodno Sejm on 22 July. Russia reorganized its newly acquired territories into <b>Minsk</b> Viceroyalty and Izyaslav Viceroyalty (which in 1795 was split into Podolian and Volhynian Viceroyalties).|$|E
5|$|The Constitution also {{establishes}} Belarusian and Russian as {{the official}} languages of the country, pledges neutrality and non-nuclear proliferation, adopts national symbols, and establishes <b>Minsk</b> as the capital (<b>Minsk</b> was previously {{the capital of the}} Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic).|$|E
5|$|Kirill Vakhromeev, {{the current}} Metropolitan of <b>Minsk</b> and Slutsk, the Patriarchal Exarch of All Belarus, {{was awarded the}} hero title for his work to restore spirituality among the Belarusian population.|$|E
5|$|The Polish {{capture of}} Vilnius {{set the stage}} for further {{escalation}} of Polish conflicts with Soviet Russia and Lithuania. In coming months, Polish forces would push steadily eastward, launching Operation <b>Minsk</b> in August.|$|E
5|$|The city of <b>Minsk</b> {{is split}} into nine districts and enjoys special {{status as the}} nation's capital. It is run by an {{executive}} committee and has been granted a charter of self-rule.|$|E
5|$|The major {{economic}} centres are Moscow, <b>Minsk</b> and Astana. The distance between Moscow and <b>Minsk</b> is 717 kilometers, {{and the distance}} between Moscow and Astana is 2700 kilometers, making infrastructure a key challenge for the integration of member states. Major infrastructure projects began during the 2000s in order to modernise and connect the regional bloc to other markets, facilitating both integration and trade in the region. In 2007 Moscow announced it will invest 1 trillion USD by 2020 to modernise the country's infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|In June 1988, the {{archaeologist}} {{and leader}} of the Christian Conservative Party of the BPF Zyanon Paznyak discovered mass graves of victims executed in 1937–41 at Kurapaty, near <b>Minsk.</b> Some nationalists contend that this discovery is proof that the Soviet government was trying to erase the Belarusian people, causing Belarusian nationalists to seek independence.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} {{hours of the}} invasion, the Luftwaffe {{destroyed}} the Western Front's air force on the ground, and {{with the aid of}} Abwehr and their supporting anti-communist fifth columns operating in the Soviet rear paralyzed the Front's communication lines, which particularly cut off the Soviet 4th Army headquarters from headquarters above and below it. On the same day, the 2nd Panzer Group crossed the Bug River, broke through the 4th Army, bypassed Brest Fortress, and pressed on towards <b>Minsk,</b> while the 3rd Panzer Group bypassed most of the 3rd Army and pressed on towards Vilnius. Simultaneously, the German 4th and 9th Armies engaged the Western Front forces in the environs of Białystok. On the order of Dmitry Pavlov, the commander of the Western Front, the 6th and 11th Mechanized Corps and the 6th Cavalry Corps launched a strong counterstrike towards Grodno on 24–25 June in hopes of destroying the 3rd Panzer Group. However, the 3rd Panzer Group had already moved on, with its forward units reaching Vilnius on the evening of 23 June, and the Western Front's armoured counterattack instead ran into infantry and antitank fire from the V Army Corps of the German 9th Army, supported by Luftwaffe air attacks. By the night of 25 June, the Soviet counterattack was defeated, and the commander of the 6th Cavalry Corps was captured. The same night, Pavlov ordered all the remnants of the Western Front to withdraw to Slonim towards <b>Minsk.</b> Subsequent counterattacks to buy time for the withdrawal were launched against the German forces, but all of them failed. On 27 June, the 2nd and 3rd Panzer Groups met near <b>Minsk</b> and captured the city the next day, completing the encirclement of almost all of the Western Front in two pockets: one around Białystok and another west of <b>Minsk.</b> The Germans destroyed the Soviet 3rd and 10th Armies while inflicting serious losses on the 4th, 11th and 13th Armies, and reported to have captured 324,000 Soviet troops, 3,300 tanks, 1,800 artillery pieces.|$|E
5|$|Music in Belarus largely {{comprises}} a rich {{tradition of}} folk and religious music. The country's folk music traditions {{can be traced}} back to the times of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In the 19th century, Polish composer Stanisław Moniuszko composed operas and chamber music pieces while living in <b>Minsk.</b> During his stay, he worked with Belarusian poet Vintsent Dunin-Martsinkyevich and created the opera Sialanka (Peasant Woman). At the end of the 19th century, major Belarusian cities formed their own opera and ballet companies. The ballet Nightingale by M. Kroshner was composed during the Soviet era and became the first Belarusian ballet showcased at the National Academic Vialiki Ballet Theatre in <b>Minsk.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 28 June, Model {{was sent}} to rescue Army Group Centre, which had been torn apart by Operation Bagration, the Soviet {{offensive}} in Belorussia. The Ninth Army (Model's old command) and Fourth Army were trapped, and the Red Army was about to liberate <b>Minsk.</b> Despite the catastrophic situation, Model believed that he could still hold <b>Minsk,</b> but this would require Fourth Army {{to break out of}} its pocket, and reinforcements to counter-attack the Soviet advance. The reinforcements, in turn, could only be obtained by pulling back, thus shortening the line and freeing up troops. The consensus is that the German position was doomed, regardless of what Model could have done, but Hitler refused to sanction either Fourth Army's escape or a general withdrawal, until it was too late.|$|E
5|$|The {{president}} {{also has an}} official residence in <b>Minsk</b> surrounded by the streets of Marx, Engels, Kirov and Komsomol. Like the American White House, the streets close to the residence are closed off to vehicular traffic and are patrolled by police forces.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{newspaper}} Soviet Byelorussia, President Lukashenko decided on the anthem on June 12, 2002 and chose to have its first performance on July 3, Belarusian independence day, {{the anniversary of the}} date in 1944 when the Wehrmacht was driven away from <b>Minsk</b> by the Red Army. However, the first performance actually took place on July 2 at a concert organized by the government as part of the Belarusian independence festivities.|$|E
5|$|All {{publications}} and media {{were subjected to}} censorship. The Soviets sought to recruit Polish left-wing intellectuals {{who were willing to}} cooperate. Soon after the Soviet invasion, the Writers' Association of Soviet Ukraine created a local chapter in Lwów; there was a Polish-language theater and radio station. Polish cultural activities in <b>Minsk</b> and Wilno were less organized. These activities were strictly controlled by the Soviet authorities, which saw to it that these activities portrayed the new Soviet regime in a positive light and vilified the former Polish government.|$|E
5|$|Belarusian {{authorities}} {{vowed to}} prevent any large-scale demonstrations following the election (such as those that marked the Orange Revolution in Ukraine). Despite their efforts, the opposition had {{the largest number of}} demonstrators in years, with nightly protests in <b>Minsk</b> continuing for a number of days after the election. The largest protest occurred on election night; reporters for the Associated Press estimated that approximately 10,000 people turned out. Election observers from the Russia-led Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) differed on the Belarusian election.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th century, Polotsk {{resident}} Francysk Skaryna {{translated the}} Bible into Belarusian. It {{was published in}} Prague and Vilnius sometime between 1517 and 1525, making it the first book printed in Belarus or anywhere in Eastern Europe. The modern era of Belarusian literature {{began in the late}} 19th century; one prominent writer was Yanka Kupala. Many Belarusian writers of the time, such as Uładzimir Žyłka, Kazimir Svayak, Yakub Kolas, Źmitrok Biadula, and Maksim Haretski, wrote for Nasha Niva, a Belarusian-language paper published that was previously published in Vilnius but now is published in <b>Minsk.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lukashenko blamed {{foreign governments}} for conspiring against him and, in April 1998, {{expelled}} ambassadors from the Drazdy complex near <b>Minsk</b> and moved them to another building. The Drazdy conflict caused an international outcry {{and resulted in}} a travel ban on Lukashenko from the EU and the US. Although the ambassadors eventually returned after the controversy died down, Lukashenko stepped up his rhetorical attacks against the West. He stated that Western governments were trying to undermine Belarus at all levels, even sports, during the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.|$|E
5|$|On 17 October, Robson {{entered the}} {{qualifying}} draw at the Luxembourg Open. In {{the first round}} of qualifying she defeated world No. 180 Zuzana Ondrášková. In the second round of qualifying she defeated Julia Görges, the world No. 79. In the final round of qualifying she lost to Maria Elena Camerin. On 10 November, Robson beat Yuliya Beygelzimer in {{the first round of}} the <b>Minsk</b> ITF competition. She defeated Tetyana Arefyeva in the second round but was defeated in the quarter-finals by Vitalia Diatchenko.|$|E
5|$|Schneider next {{appeared}} for the United States at the 2004 IIHF World U18 Championships in <b>Minsk,</b> Belarus. He {{recorded the}} third-best GAA (1.71) and second-best save percentage (.929) {{of the tournament}} {{en route to a}} silver medal. The United States were defeated in the gold medal game by Russia 3–2. He was later named the David Peterson Goalie of the Year by USA Hockey, having led them to two medals in the 2003–04 season.|$|E
5|$|Shirokov {{made his}} {{international}} debut with Russia at the 2003 U-18 Junior World Cup, earning {{a silver medal}} while contributing four points in five games. He continued {{to play with the}} national under-18 team, helping Russia to the best records at the 2003 Four Nations and 2004 Five Nations Tournaments. At the 2004 IIHF World U18 Championships, he helped Russia to another gold medal in <b>Minsk,</b> Belarus, defeating the United States 3–2 in the final. Shirokov contributed two goals in six games.|$|E
5|$|The Belarusian {{government}} sponsors annual cultural festivals {{such as the}} Bazaar in Vitebsk, which showcases Belarusian performers, artists, writers, musicians, and actors. Several state holidays, such as Independence Day and Victory Day, draw big {{crowds and}} often include displays such as fireworks and military parades, especially in Vitebsk and <b>Minsk.</b> The government's Ministry of Culture finances events promoting Belarusian arts and culture {{both inside and outside}} the country.|$|E
5|$|The Court of the Eurasian Economic Union {{replaced}} the Court of the Eurasian Economic Community (EurAsEC Court) in 2015. It {{is in charge}} of dispute resolution and the interpretation of the legal order within the Eurasian Economic Union. Its headquarters is in <b>Minsk.</b> The court is composed of two judges from each member state, appointed by the heads of government of the member states. Their term of office is nine years.|$|E
5|$|The most {{expedient}} {{approach for}} a large-scale assault on Warsaw {{was from the}} east. Terrain was mostly flat; numerous roads converged radially along an arc from the Modlin Fortress to the north (where the Narew flows into the Vistula), to Legionowo, Radzymin, and <b>Mińsk</b> Mazowiecki directly to the east. Meanwhile, the only permanent defences {{in the area of}} Radzymin were the incomplete Fort Beniaminów and a line of First World War trenches west of Radzymin, neglected since their construction by Russians and Germans in 1915.|$|E
5|$|Under the Belarus Constitution (Part 4, Chapter 3, Article 84), the President of the Republic has {{the power}} to bestow state awards. To {{announce}} an award, the President issues a decree conferring the title to a person. Within two months, the title will be presented by the President in a formal setting, usually at the Presidential Palace in the capital city of <b>Minsk.</b> A certificate (gramota) will also be presented to the recipient, signed by the President of the Republic.|$|E
5|$|After the December {{completion}} of the 2010 presidential election, Lukashenko was elected to a fourth straight term with nearly 80% {{of the vote in}} elections. The runner-up opposition leader Andrei Sannikov received less than 3% of the vote; independent observers criticized the election as fraudulent. When opposition protesters took to the streets in <b>Minsk,</b> many people, including most rival presidential candidates, were beaten and arrested by the state militia. Many of the candidates, including Sannikov, were sentenced to prison or house arrest for terms which are mainly and typically over four years. Six months later amid an unprecedented economic crisis, activists utilized social networking to initiate a fresh round of protests characterized by wordless hand-clapping.|$|E
5|$|Aleksandras Stulginskis and Petras Klimas {{were sent}} to prison in Siberia by Soviet authorities, but survived and {{returned}} to Lithuania. Pranas Dovydaitis and Vladas Mironas were also sent to Siberia but died there. Kazys Bizauskas was shot along {{with a number of}} other prisoners on June 26, 1941 while being transported to a Soviet prison in <b>Minsk.</b> Donatas Malinauskas, along with many other civilians, was deported to Siberia and died there on November 30, 1942. His body was returned from Siberia in 1993 and reburied in Lithuania. Six of the surviving signatories emigrated to Western countries. Brothers Jurgis Šaulys and Kazimieras Steponas Šaulys died in Switzerland; Jonas Vailokaitis died in Germany; Antanas Smetona, Mykolas Biržiška and Steponas Kairys died in the United States.|$|E
5|$|All {{that changed}} with the {{assassination}} of Tsar Alexander II. The mourning for the tsar meant {{there would be no}} performances in the capital; in addition the political climate of Russia turned sharply against the Jews. Goldfaden's troupe soldiered on for a time—to <b>Minsk,</b> to Bobruisk where they played mainly to Russian soldiers, and to Vitebsk, where he and Sonya ended up having to sue Goldfaden for their pay, and left to rejoin Rosenberg, who was playing in a tent theater in Nezhin. However, matters there proved even worse: Nezhin soon fell prey to a pogrom. The troupe managed to avoid bodily harm, partly by convincing the rioters that they were a French theater troupe and partly by making judicious use of the money the Adlers had won in court from Goldfaden.|$|E
5|$|Receiving heavy {{sponsorship}} {{from the}} government, ice hockey is the nation's second most popular sport after football. The national football team has never qualified {{for a major}} tournament; however, BATE Borisov has played in the Champions League. The national hockey team finished fourth at the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics following a memorable upset win over Sweden in the quarterfinals, and regularly competes in the World Championships, often making the quarterfinals. Numerous Belarusian players {{are present in the}} Kontinental Hockey League in Eurasia, particularly for Belarusian club HC Dinamo <b>Minsk,</b> and several have also played in the National Hockey League in North America. Darya Domracheva is a leading biathlete whose honours include three gold medals at the 2014 Winter Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Sava Mutkurov {{was born}} in the city of Tarnovo in the central Danubian Plain (then part of the Ottoman Empire, today in north central Bulgaria) in 1852. He studied for two years at the Military Medical Academy in the {{imperial}} capital Constantinople (Istanbul), but graduated instead from the Cadet Infantry School in the Russian city of Odessa in 1872. As a soldier in the Imperial Russian Army, Mutkurov participated in the Serbo–Turkish War of 1876 along with other Bulgarian volunteers. He was also involved in the Russo–Turkish War of 1877–1878 which brought about the Liberation of Bulgaria. During that war, he was the commander of a company in the 54th <b>Minsk</b> Infantry Regiment of the Russian Army.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{evidence}} submitted by the prosecution {{took the form of}} depositions made by leading Nazis. The defence demanded that the men should be brought to Israel so that the defence's right to cross-examination would not be abrogated. But Hausner, in his role as Attorney General, declared that he would be obliged to have any war criminals who entered Israel arrested. The prosecution proved that Eichmann had visited places where exterminations had taken place, including Chełmno extermination camp, Auschwitz, and <b>Minsk</b> (where he witnessed a mass shooting of Jews), and therefore was aware that the deportees were being killed.|$|E
5|$|The Russian army {{numbered}} nearly 98,000. It was {{commanded by}} generals Mikhail Krechetnikov and Mikhail Kakhovsky. The Russians {{also had an}} advantage in combat experience. The Russian plan called for Kakhovsky to advance through Ukraine, taking Kamieniec Podolski, Chełm and Lublin, and approach Polish capital of Warsaw from the south. Krechetnikov was to advance through <b>Minsk,</b> Wilno, Brześć Litewski and Białystok, and approach Warsaw from the north, where he was to link with Kakhovsky. Whereas the Russians had good intelligence network in Poland, and were mostly aware of Polish army distribution and strength; the Poles had much less intelligence, receiving contradictory and often erroneous reports, and unsure whether the war would even start {{up to the point}} the Russian troops crossed the border.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Lithuania between 1219 and 1295 {{concerns}} {{the establishment and}} early history of the first Lithuanian state, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The beginning of the 13th century {{marks the end of}} the prehistory of Lithuania. From this point on the history of Lithuania is recorded in chronicles, treaties, and other written documents. In 1219, 21 Lithuanian dukes signed a peace treaty with Galicia–Volhynia. This event is widely accepted as the first proof that the Baltic tribes were uniting and consolidating. Despite continuous warfare with two Christian orders, the Livonian Order and the Teutonic Knights, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was established and gained some control over the lands of Black Ruthenia, Polatsk, <b>Minsk,</b> and other territories east of modern-day Lithuania that had become weak and vulnerable after the collapse of Kievan Rus'.|$|E
5|$|During a {{visit to}} <b>Minsk</b> in August 1941, Himmler {{witnessed}} an Einsatzgruppen mass execution first-hand and concluded that shooting Jews was too stressful for his men. By November he made arrangements for any SS men suffering ill health from having participated in executions to be provided with rest and mental health care. He also decided a transition {{should be made to}} gassing the victims, especially the women and children, and ordered the recruitment of expendable native auxiliaries who could assist with the murders. Gas vans, which had been used previously to kill mental patients, began to see service by all four main Einsatzgruppen from 1942. However, the gas vans were not popular with the Einsatzkommandos, because removing the dead bodies from the van and burying them was a horrible ordeal. Prisoners or auxiliaries were often assigned to do this task so as to spare the SS men the trauma. Some of the early mass killings at extermination camps used carbon monoxide fumes produced by diesel engines, similar to the method used in gas vans, but by as early as September 1941 experiments were begun at Auschwitz using Zyklon B, a cyanide-based pesticide gas.|$|E
5|$|Few inmates {{remained}} in the camp after the gassings stopped, mostly non-Jewish {{women who had been}} married to Jews. They were released several days later, after being sworn to secrecy. Apart from Sajmište inmates, the 500 patients and staff of the Belgrade Jewish Hospital, as well as Jewish prisoners from the nearby Banjica concentration camp, were also killed in the gas van. The last Jewish prisoner in Sajmište was killed on 8 May 1942, and the gas van used at the camp was returned to Berlin on 9 June 1942. It received a technical upgrade there, and was then transferred to Belarus where it was used to gas Jews in <b>Minsk.</b> Shortly after leading the extermination of the Jewish inmates in Sajmište, Andorfer and Enge were assigned different Security Police roles. Andorfer later received an Iron Cross 2nd Class for running the camp, and won a promotion.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, Petrov's corps fought in the Battle of Białystok–Minsk. The corps was initially stationed in the rear but was moved forward to Baranovichi to stop the German advance, after the initial German breakthrough. On 26 June it fought defensive battles around Baranovichi, Stowbtsy, and <b>Minsk,</b> but the XLVII Army Corps (Motorized) managed to penetrate the corps' defenses. Outnumbered, the 17th Mechanized Corps was unable to offer much resistance to the attack and its remnants retreated eastwards to the Berezina, where they linked up with other Soviet units. It suffered heavy losses in the fighting and on 5 July {{became part of the}} 21st Army after being ordered to move to Babruysk on the previous day. By 7 July the corps had no armored vehicles left and later in the month the corps was withdrawn to the Sukhinichi area with the 4th Army. It was then converted into the 147th Tank Brigade on 1 August.|$|E
5|$|In Zloda, Belarus, Amador {{uses the}} {{diamonds}} as payment for a proxcard {{to access the}} Todorov Building in <b>Minsk.</b> The team tracks her there, but Amador escapes. Skye and Agents Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons discover a strange video feed linked to Amador, which they soon discover {{to be coming from}} a camera in her eye, the source of her apparent 'powers'. Seeing the name of the hotel Amador is at through the feed, May tracks her down and confronts her. Amador reveals that her prosthetic eye contains a fail safe, so that her handler, who also relays orders in text-form through the eye, can kill her if she refuses to complete her missions. The two fight until Coulson arrives and stuns Amador. Skye hijacks the feed, and relays it through a pair of glasses that Agent Grant Ward wears, carrying out Amador's mission while Agents Fitz and Simmons remove the prosthetic eye.|$|E
