50|$|During {{the tail}} end of the Ninja Express' NJPW run, Mr. Pogo began wrestling for World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico in 1987, wrestling the likes of Ricky Santana and TNT. By the time the Ninja Express left NJPW in June 1988, he and Nagasaki were wrestling for WWC full-time. In July 1988, the Bruiser Brody murder scandal greatly damaged the wrestling scene in Puerto Rico, causing Pogo to work at a local plastic <b>molding</b> <b>plant,</b> while wrestling, due to the massive {{decrease}} in attendance and sales. At the same time, he held five WWC World Tag Team Championships, once with TNT and four times with Nagasaki. After Nagasaki left to return to NJPW, before heading to WCW, Pogo carried on the Ninja Express legacy, teaming with Kensuke Sasaki, winning two WWC Caribbean Tag Team Championships in 1989. He also held the WWC World Junior Heavyweight Championship once, despite being over the weight limit, before leaving WWC in 1991.|$|E

40|$|Priming {{refers to}} a {{mechanism}} whereby plants are sensitized to respond faster and/or more strongly to future pathogen attack. Here, we demonstrate that preexposure to the green leaf volatile Z- 3 -hexenyl acetate (Z- 3 -HAC) primed wheat (Triticum aestivum) for enhanced defense against subsequent infection with the hemibiotrophic fungus Fusarium graminearum. Bioassays showed that, after priming with Z- 3 -HAC, wheat ears accumulated up to 40 % fewer necrotic spikelets. Furthermore, leaves of seedlings showed significantly smaller necrotic lesions comparedwith nonprimed plants, coinciding with strongly reduced fungal growth in planta. Additionally, we found that F. graminearum produced more deoxynivalenol, a mycotoxin, in the primed treatment. Expression analysis of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis genes and exogenous methyl salicylate and methyl jasmonate applications showed that plant defense against F. graminearum is sequentially regulated by SA and JA during the early and later stages of infection, respectively. Interestingly, analysis {{of the effect of}} Z- 3 -HAC pretreatment on SA-and JA-responsive gene expression in hormone-treated and pathogen-inoculated seedlings revealed that Z- 3 -HAC boosts JA-dependent defenses during the necrotrophic infection stage of F. graminearum but suppresses SA-regulated defense during its biotrophic phase. Together, these findings highlight the importance of temporally separated hormone changes in <b>molding</b> <b>plant</b> health and disease and support a scenario whereby the green leaf volatile Z- 3 -HAC protects wheat against Fusarium head blight by priming for enhanced JA-dependent defenses during the necrotrophic stages of infection...|$|E
40|$|Transient heat {{transfer}} phenomena in the rotational molding of plastic parts are modeled in this study. Natural convection and {{radiation from the}} furnace and flue gases to the mold housing are analyzed. Other models include transient {{heat transfer}} through the mold, single-phase conduction through the particulate plastic material prior to phase change, melting of the plastic and heating of the liquid pool. Subsequent staged cooling of the mold and solidification of the plastic {{using a combination of}} free and forced convection and radiation, are also modeled. The mold wall, melt, and solidified plastic regions are divided into a number of finite segments to track the temperature variation with time during the molding process. The corresponding variations in masses and thicknesses of the melt and solidified plastic regions are estimated. This information is used to estimate the energy consumption rates for various phases of the process. The model is applied to a specific molding process in a commercial rotational <b>molding</b> <b>plant.</b> Parametric studies of the effect of heating and cooling durations on the plastic temperatures and the energy consumption rates are conducted. These analyses provide insights about opportunities for optimization of the heating and cooling schedules to reduce overall energy consumption and improve throughput. The overall energy and gas consumption for the rotational molding process, taking into consideration the thermal mass of the auxiliary housing (steel) required to hold the molds, is estimated on a per-batch basis. In addition, a preliminary design for an alternative system for heating and cooling the molds using a high temperature heat transfer fluid (HTF) flowing through jackets integral to the molds is proposed.

The yeast and slime mold DHPases were over-expressed, shown to contain two zinc ions, characterized for their properties and compared {{to those of the}} calf liver enzyme. In general, the kinetic parameters varied widely among the enzymes, the mammalian DHPase having the highest catalytic efficiency. The ring opening was catalyzed most efficiently at pH 8. 0 and competitively inhibited by the reaction product, N-carbamyl-β-alanine. At lower pH values DHPases catalyzed the reverse reaction, the closing of the ring. Apparently, eukaryote DHPases are enzymatically as well as phylogenetically related to the de novo biosynthetic dihydroorotase (DHOase) enzymes. Modeling studies showed that the position of the catalytically critical amino acid residues of bacterial DHOases and eukaryote DHPases overlap. Therefore, only a few modifications might have been necessary during evolution to convert the unspecialized enzyme into anabolic and catabolic ones...|$|R
40|$|The {{perception}} and absorption of light by plants is {{a driving force}} in plant evolutionary history, as plants have evolved multiple photoreceptors to perceive different light attributes including duration, intensity, direction and quality. Plant photoreceptors interpret these signals from the light environment and <b>mold</b> <b>plant</b> architecture to maximize foliar light capture. As active sites of the production and accumulation of energy‐rich products, leaves are targets of pests and pathogens, which have driven the selection of physiological processes to protect these energy‐rich tissues. In the last ten years, several research groups have accumulated evidence showing that plant photoreceptors control specific molecular programs that define plant growth and immune processes. Here, we discuss recent knowledge addressing these roles in Arabidopsis and show that (1) plant immune responses affect energy acquisition and partitioning; (2) plant photoreceptors interpret the light environment and control growth and immune processes; and finally; (3) defense and light signaling pathways can be genetically manipulated to obtain plants able to grow and defend at the same time. This basic knowledge from Arabidopsis plants should lead new lines of applied research in crops...|$|R

40|$|Candida albicans is {{the major}} fungal {{pathogen}} in humans, yet {{little is known about}} transcriptional regulation in this organism. Therefore, we have isolated, characterized, and expressed the C. albicans TATA-binding protein (TBP) gene (TBP 1), because this general transcription initiation factor {{plays a key role in}} the activation and regulation of eukaryotic promoters. Southern and Northern blot analyses suggest that a single C. albicans TBP 1 locus is expressed at similar levels in the yeast and hyphal forms of this fungus. The TBP 1 open reading frame is 716 bp long and encodes a functional TBP of 27 kDa. C. albicans TBP is capable of binding specifically to a TATA box in vitro, substituting for the human TBP to activate basal transcription in vitro, and suppressing the lethal Δspt 15 mutation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The predicted amino acid sequences of TBPs from C. albicans and other organisms reveal a striking pattern of C-terminal conservation and N-terminal variability: the C-terminal DNA-binding domain displays at least 80 % amino acid sequence identity to TBPs from fungi, flies, nematodes, slime <b>molds,</b> <b>plants,</b> and humans. Sequence differences between human and fungal TPBs in the DNA-binding domain may represent potential targets for antifungal therapy...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} two decades the study of Ca(2 +) {{homeostasis}} in living cells has been enhanced by the explosive development of genetically encoded Ca(2 +) -indicators. The cloning of the Ca(2 +) -sensitive photoprotein aequorin and of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria has been enormously advantageous. As polypeptides, aequorin and GFP allow their endogenous production in cell systems as diverse as bacteria, yeast, slime <b>molds,</b> <b>plants,</b> and mammalian cells. Moreover, it is possible to specifically localize them within the cell by including defined targeting signals in the amino acid sequence. These two proteins have been extensively engineered to obtain several recombinant probes for different biological parameters, among which Ca(2 +) concentration reporters are probably the most relevant. The GFP-based Ca(2 +) probes and aequorin are widely employed in the study of intracellular Ca(2 +) homeostasis. The new generation of bioluminescent probes that couple the Ca(2 +) sensitivity of aequorin to GFP fluorescence emission allows real-time measurements of subcellular Ca(2 +) changes in single cell imaging experiments and the video-imaging of Ca(2 +) concentrations changes in live transgenic animals that express GFP-aequorin bifunctional probes...|$|R
