40|$|Cake cutting is a {{fundamental}} model in fair division; it represents the problem of fairly allocating a heterogeneous divisible good among agents with different preferences. The central criteria of fairness are proportionality and envy-freeness, {{and many of the}} existing protocols are designed to guarantee proportional or envy-free allocations, when the participating agents follow the protocol. However, typically, all agents following the protocol is not guaranteed to result in a Nash equilibrium. In this paper, we initiate the study of equilibria of classical cake cutting protocols. We consider one of the simplest and most elegant continuous algorithms – the Dubins-Spanier procedure, which guarantees a proportional allocation of the cake – and study its equilibria when the agents use simple threshold strategies. We show that given a cake cutting instance with strictly positive value density functions, every envy-free allocation of the cake can be mapped to a pure Nash equilibrium of the corresponding <b>moving</b> <b>knife</b> game. Moreover, every pure Nash equilibrium of the <b>moving</b> <b>knife</b> game induces an envy-free allocation of the cake. In addition, the <b>moving</b> <b>knife</b> game has an ɛ-equilibrium which is ε-envy-free, allocates the entire cake, and is independent of the tie-breaking rule...|$|E
40|$|The minimal {{number of}} {{parallel}} cuts required to divide a cake into n pieces is n- 1. A new 3 -person procedure, requiring 2 parallel cuts, is given that produces an envy- free division, whereby each person thinks {{he or she}} receives at least a tied- for- largest piece. An extension of this procedure leads to a 4 -person division, us ing 3 parallel cuts, that makes at most one player envious. Finally, a 4 -person envy-free procedure is given, but it requires up to 5 parallel cuts, and some pieces may be disconnected. All these procedures improve on extant procedures by using fewer <b>moving</b> <b>knives,</b> making fewer people envious, or using fewer cuts. While the 4 -person, 5 -cut procedure is complex, endowing people with more information about others' preferences, or allowing them to do things beyond stopping <b>moving</b> <b>knives,</b> may yield simpler procedures for making envy- free divisions with minimal cuts, which are known always to existFAIR DIVISION; CAKE CUTTING; ENVY-FREENESS; MAXIMIN...|$|R

40|$|A unique {{laboratory}} device, the Laboratory Shear, {{has been}} designed and built to simulate and examine the shear angle cutting process, which is the predominant method used in many cutting operations. The device is capable of force and velocity measurements of the shear angle cutting process with the abilities to vary cutting speed, knife preload, and blade geometry. The dimensions of the device are such that mobility to and from conditioning rooms in the laboratory environment are not limited. Assembly and disassembly ease as well as automatic versus manual operation options were incorporated for greater experimental flexibility. The device {{has the ability to}} evaluate products at a shear velocity of 200 inches per second, which equates to nearly 1000 feet per minute on a conventional slitter with 10 shear angle. The force measurement capability is 10 pounds, which is sufficient to handle the majority of Kodak films. Knife preload can be adjusted to provide preloads from 2 lbs to 12 lbs, in increments of 2 lbs. Debug of the Lab Shear Device was conducted and included knife sharpness measurement as well as calibration of the load cell and velocity transducer. The upper (<b>moving)</b> <b>knife</b> was found to have a cutting tip radius of approximately 0. 0002 inch and the lower (stationary) knife was found to have a cutting tip radius of approximately 0. 0001 inch.

50|$|By {{mechanically}} <b>moving</b> the <b>knife</b> edge {{across the}} beam, {{the amount of}} energy impinging the detector area is determined by the obstruction. The profile is then measured from the knife-edge velocity and its relation to the detector's energy reading. Unlike other systems, a unique scanning technique uses several different oriented knife-edges to sweep across the beam. By using tomographic reconstruction, mathematical processes reconstruct the laser beam size in different orientations to an image similar to the one produced by CCD cameras. The main advantage of this scanning method is that it is free from pixel size limitations (as in CCD cameras) and allows beam reconstructions with wavelengths not usable with existing CCD technology. Reconstruction is possible for beams in deep UV to far IR.|$|R

50|$|On the {{right-hand}} edge is a long, curved steel blade, {{often referred to}} as a knife, attached to the base at one corner. Larger versions have a strong compression coil spring as part of the attachment mechanism that pulls the knife against the stationary edge as the knife is drawn down to cut the paper. The other end of the knife unit is a handle. The stationary right edge of the base is also steel, with an exposed, finely-ground edge. When the knife is pulled down to cut paper, the action resembles that of a pair of scissors, only instead of two <b>knives</b> <b>moving</b> against each other, one is stationary. The combination of a blade mounted to a steady base produces clean and straight cuts, the likes of which would have otherwise required a ruler and razor blade to achieve on a single page. Paper cutters are also used for cutting thin sheet metal, cardboard, and plastic. The blade on a paper cutter is made of steel which makes it almost impossible to break.|$|R

40|$|The formal {{mathematical}} {{theory of}} fair division has a rich history dating {{back at least}} to Steinhaus in the 1940 ’s [Ste 1, Ste 2, Ste 3, Ste 4]. In recent work in this area, several general classes of errors have appeared along with confusion about the necessity and sufficiency of certain hypotheses. It is {{the purpose of this article}} to correct the scientific record and to point out with concrete examples some of the pitfalls that have led to these mistakes. These examples may serve as guideposts for future work. As a basic starting point for discussing fair division, consider the classical Moving-Knife procedure below, a continuous version of a discrete procedure first described by Steinhaus [Ste 3] and attributed to Banach and Knaster: Moving-Knife Procedure [DSp, p. 2]. “A knife is slowly moved at constant speed parallel to itself over the top of the cake. At each instant the knife is poised so that it could cut a unique slice of the cake. At time goes by the potential slice increases monotonely from nothing until it becomes the entire cake. The first person to indicate satisfaction with the slice then determined by the position of the knife receives that slice and is eliminated from further distribution of the cake. (If two or more participants simultaneously indicate satisfaction with the slice, it is given to any of them.) The process is repeated with the other n − 1 participants and with what remains of the cake. ” The only implicit assumptions here are that the values are nonnegative, additive, and, in the direction the <b>knife</b> is <b>moving,</b> continuous.
