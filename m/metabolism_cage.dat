40|$|The <b>metabolism</b> <b>cage</b> is a barren, non-enriched, environment, {{combining}} {{a number}} of recognized environmental stressors. We investigated the ability of male BALB/c mice to acclimatize to this form of housing. For three weeks markers of acute and oxidative stress, as well as clinical signs of abnormality were monitored. Forced swim tests were conducted {{to determine whether the}} animals experienced behavioral despair and the serotonergic integrity was tested using an 8 -OH-DPAT challenge. The <b>metabolism</b> <b>cage</b> housed mice excreted approximately tenfold higher amounts of corticosterone metabolites in feces throughout the study when compared to controls. Urinary biomarkers confirmed that these mice suffered from elevated levels of oxidative stress, and increased creatinine excretions indicated increased muscle catabolism. Changes in the core body temperature (stress-induced hyperthermia) and the fur state of the mice also indicated impaired well-being in the <b>metabolism</b> <b>cage</b> housed mice. However, monitoring body weight and feed intake was found misleading in assessing the wellbeing of mice over a longer time course, and the forced swim test was found poorly suited for studying chronic stress in mice in the present setup. In conclusion, the mice were found not to acclimatize to the metabolism cages whereby concern for animal welfare would dictate that mice should be housed in this way for as short periods as possible. The elevated degree of HPA axis activity, oxidative stress, and increased overall metabolism warrant caution when interpreting data obtained from <b>metabolism</b> <b>cage</b> housed mice, as their condition cannot be considered representative of a normal physiology...|$|E

40|$|Inflammation {{alters the}} {{functional}} {{properties of the}} urinary bladder. Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a chronic inflammatory syndrome in man that is characterized by urgency, frequency and visceral pain. The overall {{aim of this study}} was to investigate how the rat urinary bladder is affected by inflammation, and what specific part the urothelium plays in this. Methods: Cystitis was induced in rats by a single injection of cyclophosphamide (CYP; 100 mg/kg). This treatment causes a disease state which is highly comparable to IC. Data comparing the properties of the healthy and inflamed bladder were gathered from (1) contraction experiments in vitro in an organ bath setup, (2) cystometrical studies in vivo in anaesthetized rats and (3) wake, freely moving rats in a <b>metabolism</b> <b>cage.</b> Cell cultures were also cultivated in order to investigate if proliferation of urothelial cells is influenced by receptor activation. Key findings: Induction of cystitis by CYP altered the cholinergic response of the urinary bladder. In vitro studies showed a significantly lower response to carbachol in the inflamed bladder. Both in vitro and in vivo, the altered cholinergic response could be normalized by either removal of the urothelium, blockade of nitric oxide (NO) synthase or blockade of muscarinic M 1 /M 3 /M 5 receptors. These findings indicate that during CYP-induced cystitis, NO is released from the urothelium upon muscarinic receptor activation. Further characterization in vitro revealed the M 5 receptor as the most likely candidate for mediating this release. In vivo experiments in the <b>metabolism</b> <b>cage</b> showed that micturition parameters are affected by CYP-induced cystitis. Increasing doses of a muscarinic antagonist eliminated these differences, and a connection between the effects of antimuscarinic and antinitrergic 5 drugs was indicated. These findings underline the importance of muscarinic receptors and NO in the alterations seen during cystitis. Proliferation experiments indicated that adrenergic, but not muscarinic, nicotinic or EGF receptors, are involved in the regulation of urothelial cell proliferation. Conclusions: In CYP-induced cystitis in the rat, the urothelium exerts an inhibitory influence on the cholinergic response of the urinary bladder. We conclude that this is caused by the release of NO upon activation of urothelial muscarinic M 5 receptors.

40|$|In {{areas with}} dense populations of animals, the excreta cause major {{environmental}} problems. Nitrogen is often excreted in too high amounts. High water contents in animal slurry increase {{the costs of}} transport and processing. The objective of the experiments was to evaluate the effects of reduced dietary protein contents on dry matter and nitrogen in the excreta of growing pigs, {{as well as to}} study the effect of age on water intake, urine production and nitrogen utilization. Growing pigs, weighing between 20 and 70 kg, were housed in <b>metabolism</b> <b>cages</b> and allowed free access to feed and water. The diet contained 12. 9 % of crude protein and was supplemented with l-lysine, dl-methionine, l-threonine and l-tryptophan. The ratio between water and feed intake was 1. 43 and was almost constant throughout the experimental period. Urine production, when compared with intake of drinking water, was initially 33 % and increased up to 44 % when the animals reached 70 kg. Nitrogen utilization diminished with age from 62. 9 % to 49. 2 %. In the second trial three diets containing 18. 5 %, 16. 3 % and 12. 9 % of crude protein were fed ad libitum to fattening pigs (70 - 85 kg), which were also maintained in <b>metabolism</b> <b>cages.</b> Reduction of the crude protein content from 18. 5 % to 12. 9 % resulted in a 21 % lower water intake and increased the dry matter content of the excreta (faeces + urine) from 11. 7 % to 17. 1 %; nitrogen excretion was lowered by 39. 2 %. Taking into account that in practical conditions fattening diets contain approximately 16 % of crude protein and that extra water is added to the excreta, it could be calculated that the dietary protein reduction to 12. 9 % would eventually result in a relative increase of the dry matter content of the manure by 14. 7 %. status: publishe...|$|R

To calculate the nutrients consumption, the quantities supplied and the leftovers were weighed to form {{at the end of}} the period, a composite sample for laboratory analysis. There was significant difference (P 0. 05 %) between treatments to digestibility coefficients of DM, OM, energy, HEM, Cellular Content (CC), NFC and total digestible nutrients (TDN). Regarding the coefficient of digestibility of the ether extract (EE), as the by-product was included in the diet, increased the digestibility of this parameter. The digestibility of ADF and NDF decreased as it did the inclusion of the by-product of coconut. Thus, the use of byproduct over 6 % of complete feed based on corn and soybeans meal is not recommended...|$|R
40|$|Tannin can {{be found}} in many {{tropical}} plants and the presence of tannin may reduce the nutritional value of feed. However, it can give beneficial effect as it protects the protein from its excessive degradation in the rumen. Tofu waste is abundant in a country, including Indonesia, where tofu is produced widely. A feeding trial on sheep to study the effect of tannin on microbial protein synthesis and condition of rumen fermentation, digestibility and N retention of feed containing tofu waste was conducted. Fifteen sheep were allocated to one of 3 treatments, i. e: 1) control treatment, feed without tannin, 2) feed + tannin treatment and 3) feed + tannin + polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatment. The sheep was placed in the individual <b>metabolism</b> <b>cage.</b> They were fed with treatment feed for 14 days and then, the following 7 days, faeces and urine were collected. At the end of the treatment, rumen fluid was taken from each sheep before and after feeding. Rumen parameter (pH, ammonia, SCFA, protozoa) and microbial protein synthesis, digestibility, nitrogen retention were observed. Results showed that inclusion of 4 % tannin in the feed depressed ammonia production in the rumen of sheep before and 3 hours after morning feeding. Total SCFA and individual SCFA were not different among treatments. Tannin did not affect daily feed intake. Tannin lowered the dry matter, organic matter and protein digestibilities but it significantly reduced ADF digestibility (P < 0. 05) and tended to reduce NDF digestibility (P < 0. 1). However, tannin increased the microbial protein synthesis. PEG addition was expected to bind tannin and alleviate the negative effect of tannin...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} were {{conducted at the}} Swine Sector of the Animal ScienceDepartment at the Universidade Federal de Lavras (UFLA), {{in order to determine}} the effect ofcorn substitution by grain sorghum without tannin on 10 to 30 kg piglets performance. The firstone (the metabolism assay) aimed at determining the nitrogen retention, the digestibility coefficient of crude protein (DCCP), the digestible energy (DE) and the metabolizable energy (ME) ofexperimental rations in which corn was substituted by grain sorghum at levels 0, 33, 66 and 100 %. The metabolism essay was carried out in two periods using twenty-four piglets (Landracex Large White) with the initial weight of 12. 50 kg (± 0, 70). It was utilized the total fecescollection method and ferric oxide as a fecal marker, and each experimental period lasted 12 days, being seven days for adaptation and five to feces and urine colection. The pigs werekept in a <b>metabolism</b> <b>cage.</b> In the second experiment (the performance essay), there wereutilized ninety-six piglets weaned at 35 days, (Landrace x Large White) with initial weight of 9. 4 kg (± 0. 86) distributed in a randomized block design with four treatments and six replicates. The experimental period was 30 days long. The treatments were the same as described for themetabolism assay. The data showed no significant effects (P> 0. 01) on the nitrogen retention(NR), coefficient of digestibility of crude protein (CDCP), digestible energy (DE) ormetabolizable energy (ME). The data on feed intake, weight gain feed conversion showed nodifference either (P> 0. 01), among all rations tested. According to the results, corn shouldreplaced by grain sorghum without tannin up to 100 % in 10 to 30 kg piglet rations with noinfluence on nutrients digestibility and piglet performance...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of metabolic cage housing on the Wistar rat physiological state and to analyze the correlation between the minerals in blood and urine. Thirty male rats were used in the experiment. Fifteen rats (control group) were housed individually in standard polycarbonate cages and fifteen rats (experimental group) in metabolic cages (Techniplast, Italy) for two weeks. Body weight, respiration rate, water and food consumptions were recorded for each animal at the beginning of the experiment. The same parameters, as well as blood and urine parameters of control and experimental animals were recorded during the experiment after 72 h, 168 h and 336 h of housing in standard cages and metabolic cages. Urine collection was measured only in the experimental group. Rats weight decreased from 3. 84 % to 18. 59 % (P< 0. 05), respiration rate from 18. 65 % to 24. 59 % (P< 0. 05) when rats were housed in metabolic cages. Consumption of food and water by the rat depended on how long the animal was kept in metabolic cage. Glucose concentration increased on average by 15. 37 %, WBC count decreased by 5. 83 % in the blood of rats housed in metabolic cages compared to the animals housed in standard cages. We did not observe significant changes of triglycerides concentration, red blood cells count and total protein between all rats. The positive moderate correlation of rat housing in a metabolic cage was between K blood and K urine, P blood and P urine, Na blood and K blood, between Na urine and P urine and significant negative moderate correlation was determined between K urine and P urine. These present study findings indicate that <b>metabolism</b> <b>cage</b> housing significantly affects rat’s physiological parameters and potentially may influence animal health and wellbeing...|$|E
40|$|Twelve sheep were {{individually}} fed either green cocksfoot pasture or tagasaste in <b>metabolism</b> <b>cages.</b> Liveweight gain, {{dry matter}} digestibility, mineral {{content of the}} feeds, apparent uptake from the gut and levels of retention of P, S, K, Ca, Mg and Na were measured {{over a period of}} ten days. Despite 20 % higher dry matter intake and 10 % higher digestibility and 40 % higher N content in the feed, the sheep fed tagasaste performed no better than the sheep fed pasture. Levels of all minerals were lower in the tagasaste than in the pasture. Apparent efficiency of absorption of N, Mg and Na was greater with the tagasaste, while that for K, P and S was less; retention of S and Na was greater and that for P, K and Ca was less. The performance of sheep fed tagasaste may be restricted by retention of P, S, or Ca, but is less likely to be restricted by low retention of K, Mg or Na...|$|R
40|$|This {{digestibility}} trial involved 16 male pigeons, allocated ad random in 2 {{groups of}} 8 animals {{and kept in}} individual <b>metabolism</b> <b>cages.</b> The experiment {{was carried out in}} order to evaluate the effect of infrared irradiation on the apparent digestibility of protein and organic matter. The micronizing process of the peas took place at 130 -degrees-C during 30 seconds and resulted in a 22 p. c. loss of trypsine inhibitory activity. A first group of pigeons was fed a seed mixture containing 61. 5 p. c. raw peas. The other group was fed a diet with 50 p. c. processed and 11. 5 p. c. raw peas. The results suggest that {{in order to determine the}} fecal nitrogen, the determination of uric acid in the excreta of pigeons is more accurate than the lead acetate precipitation assay. The dry heat treatment did not influence the apparent digestibility of the organic matter and protein...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} was to {{evaluate}} the intake and digestibility of nutrients and basal glucose of nulliparous ewe lambs in two stages of gestation and submited to two nutritional management: restricted and unrestricted. The experiment was conducted at the Veterinary School of the Federal University of Minas Gerais, in the laboratory of Animal Metabolism and Calorimetry in the months of June and July of 2006. Twenty nulliparous ewe lambs were used and they were divided into two nutritional management (restricted and unrestricted). The animals were kept in <b>metabolism</b> <b>cages</b> fitted with trough, water cooler (plastic bucket) and salt shaker. The diets were composed of Tifton 85 hay chopped, experimental concentrate (corn bran, soybean meal and limestone) and when needed was added more soybean meal to close the rations. The nutritional requirements were based on National Research Council (1985) and was respected division of gestation according to the recommendation of this committee. For animals kept in nutritional restriction were removed 15...|$|R
