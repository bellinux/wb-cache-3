On November 7, 2006, she defeated Republican Greg Hartmann in the 2006 general election by a 55%–40% margin and took office on January 8, 2007. [...] Since the office is one {{that serves as a}} keeper of public records, the histories of the two candidates' vigilance against identity theft was an important issue. [...] The campaign also included mudslinging. She also received significant support from the Secretary of State Project, which [...] "helped <b>me</b> <b>toward</b> the election".|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} Albuquerque, New Mexico on November 2, 2009. Filming {{took place in}} several different New Mexico locations, before concluding in Albuquerque in January 2010. A large section of the film was filmed at Los Alamos High School in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Los Alamos County granted a special request from the film's director and producer to name the town in the movie [...] "Los Alamos, New Mexico." [...] The local police department loaned the film crew 1980s style uniforms and patrol cars to use for the film and over 100 local teenagers were cast as extras. Reeves felt that Lindqvist's story was very naturalistic and wanted the film to be shot the same way. After viewing Bright Star, he hired Greig Fraser as his cinematographer because he admired Fraser's work with natural light on the film. Shortly before filming, Reeves sought advice from Steven Spielberg for directing child actors. Spielberg instructed Reeves to have the two leads each keep a diary in character {{with the intention of}} sharing with Reeves what they wrote in it. Reeves stated, [...] "It was all a process of trying to, not only guide them, but in places, trying to let them guide <b>me</b> <b>toward</b> their perspective. That was important." ...|$|E
500|$|Casting {{announcements}} {{began in}} June 2009 when Noah Wyle was announced as the lead. Wyle, {{who worked with}} TNT on the Librarian films, was sent scripts for various shows on their network. He said {{part of the reason}} he chose the part was to gain credibility from his children. [...] "With the birth of my kids, I started to really look at my career through their eyes more than my own, so that does dictate choice, steering <b>me</b> <b>toward</b> certain things and away from other things," [...] he said. He also decided to do it as he could relate with his character, stating [...] "I identified with Tom's devotion to his sons, and admired his sense of social duty." [...] Spielberg wanted Wyle for the role because he knew him from his previous series ER, which Spielberg's company produced. He had wanted Wyle to appear in his 1998 film Saving Private Ryan but due to scheduling conflicts, he was unable to star. Spielberg stated that he was determined to work with him again. In July 2009, Moon Bloodgood, Jessy Schram, Seychelle Gabriel and Maxim Knight were cast as Anne Glass, Karen Nadler, Lourdes and Matt Mason, respectively. Bloodgood, the female lead, did not have to audition for the role. She received the script and was offered the role. Bloodgood was drawn to the role because of Spielberg and Rodat's involvement. She stated: [...] "Well certainly when you get handed a script and they tell you it’s Bob Rodat and Steven Spielberg, you’re immediately drawn to it. It’s got your attention. I was a little cautious about wanting to do science fiction again. But {{it was more of a}} drama story, more of a family story. I liked that and I wanted to work with Spielberg." [...] Bloodgood added that portraying a doctor excited her. [...] "I liked the idea of playing a doctor and deviating from something I had done already," [...] she said. In August 2009, Drew Roy and Peter Shinkoda were cast as Hal Mason and Dai, respectively. Drew Roy's agent received the script and the pair joked that Roy might get the role. [...] "This one came to me through my agent, just like everything else. We even joked about the fact that it was a Steven Spielberg project. We were like, [...] "Oh yeah, I might have a chance." [...] We were just joking." [...] He auditioned four times for the part. [...] "The whole process went on for quite some time, and then towards the end, it was down to me and one other guy, and we were literally waiting for the word from Steven Spielberg ‘cause he had to watch the two audition tapes and give the okay. That, in and of itself, had me like, [...] "Okay, even if I don’t get it, that’s just cool." [...] Fortunately, it went my way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Watts's explorations and {{teaching}} {{brought him into}} contact with many noted intellectuals, artists, and American teachers in the human potential movement. His friendship with poet Gary Snyder nurtured his sympathies with the budding environmental movement, to which Watts gave philosophical support. He also encountered Robert Anton Wilson, who credited Watts with being one of his [...] "Light along the Way" [...] in the opening appreciation of Cosmic Trigger. Werner Erhard attended workshops given by Alan Watts and said of him, [...] "He pointed <b>me</b> <b>toward</b> what I now call the distinction between Self and Mind. After my encounter with Alan, {{the context in which}} I was working shifted." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{even saw}} the Aurora take off one night - or an {{aircraft}} {{that matched the}} Aurora's reputed configuration, a sharp delta with twin tails about a hundred and thirty feet long. It taxied out of a lighted hangar at two-thirty A.M. and used a lot of runway to take off. It had one red light on top, but the minute the wheels left the runway, the light went off {{and that was the}} last I saw of it. I didn't hear it because the wind was blowing from behind <b>me</b> <b>toward</b> the base." [...] I asked when this had taken place. [...] "February 1994. Obviously they didn't think anybody was out there. It was thirty below zero - probably ninety below with the wind chill factor. I had hiked into White Sides from a different, harder way than usual, and stayed there two or three days among the rocks, under a camouflage tarp with six layers of clothes on. I had an insulated face mask and two sleeping bags, so I didn't present a heat signature. I videotaped the aircraft through a telescope with a five-hundred-millimeter f4 lens coupled via a C-ring to a high-eight digital video camera with five hundred and twenty scan lines of resolution, which is better than TV." [...] The author then asked, [...] "Where's the tape?" [...] "Locked away. That's a legitimate spyplane; my purpose is not to give away legitimate national defense. When they get ready to unveil it, I'll probably release the tape." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{his return}} to America in 1841, Pratt found the church {{membership}} in contention over several issues. Rumors and gossip were rife in Nauvoo, Illinois, and Pratt found the religious principle of plural marriage difficult to accept. He rebelled against Joseph Smith when a report by disaffected Mormon John C. Bennett accused Smith of proposing marriage to Pratt's wife, Sarah Pratt, which Smith categorically denied. Additionally, a story was circulating that Sarah Pratt had been involved with Bennett himself. Pratt was torn between believing his wife or Smith, and wrote, [...] "My sorrows are greater than I can bear!" [...] A public meeting was held where a resolution supporting Smith's character was proposed; Pratt stated that {{he was unable to}} support the resolution, to which Smith replied, [...] "Have you personally a knowledge of any immoral act in <b>me</b> <b>toward</b> the female sex, or in any other way?", to which Pratt answered no. After days of Smith and {{the other members of the}} Twelve remonstrating with Pratt, they decided that he would not yield, and thus Pratt was excommunicated on August 20, 1842. Bennett claimed that Pratt and his wife were planning to leave Nauvoo and help him [...] "expose Mormonism"; Pratt would later publish a statement in the Nauvoo Expositor to deny this claim. Pratt reconciled with Smith a few months after their falling out and requested re-baptism. Pratt was reinstated in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on January 20, 1843. Smith and Pratt directly discussed Pratt's wife, with Smith stating to him, [...] "She lied about me: I never made the offer which she said I did." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 9, the Defense Intelligence Agency {{received}} {{information from}} a source considered reliable, predicting that [...] "the situation is presently more critical than previously reported" [...] and postulating a 50% chance Iraq would invade Iran. An April 11 CIA analysis is more blunt: [...] "Evidence indicates that Iraq had probably planned to initiate a major military move against Iran {{with the aim of}} toppling the Khomeini regime"—and had [...] "sought to engage the Kuwaitis to act as intermediary in obtaining United States approval and support for Iraqi military action against Iran." [...] Carter himself has confirmed that fear the U.S. hostages would be executed if Iraq attacked was one reason he approved a failed rescue mission on April 24. In light of these alerts, the claims of senior Carter administration officials involved with Iran—including White, Naas, Precht, and head of the National Security Council (NSC)'s Iran desk Gary Sick—that they were surprised by the invasion require some explanation. In all likelihood, these warnings went unheeded because [...] "those who doubted they amounted to compelling evidence won the argument. In effect, they were right. Only in early July did U.S. observers note the movement of Iraqi assets out of garrison with war-related 'basic loads' of ammunition" [...] and it was not until September 17 that the CIA indicated [...] "the intensification of border clashes between Iran and Iraq has reached a point where a serious conflict is now a distinct possibility." [...] Even then, as recounted by State Department official W. Nathaniel Howell, U.S. officials remained unsure what to make of Saddam's intentions: [...] "We all followed Saddam's actions and rhetoric closely but most people I knew tended to believe he was posturing." [...] When the invasion came on September 22, [...] "it was unclear whether Saddam had simply fallen into a rage following a smaller skirmish." [...] White recalled: [...] "The outbreak of war did, in fact, {{come as a surprise to}} most of us because a decent portion of Iraq's ground forces were still in garrison. The hasty movement of the remaining units up to the front immediately after the beginning of major hostilities was the activity that tended to nudge <b>me</b> <b>toward</b> the abrupt scenario in which Saddam ordered the attack before all military preparations had been completed." [...] Thus, in the view of Chris Emery, [...] "it is unlikely that the United States was ever in possession of clear evidence of Saddam's intention to invade Iran. Although the Carter administration drastically underestimated the scale of Saddam's plans, the disorganized and apparently impetuous nature of the invasion, with much of the Iraqi army still in garrison, and occurring in the context of border skirmishes and aggressive propaganda, muddied the waters for U.S. observers." ...|$|E
