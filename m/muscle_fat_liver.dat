Based on this calculation and considering {{the results of the}} livestock feeding studies, the calculator also derives the highest residue levels (in milligrams per kilogram) in the relevant tissues and products (<b>muscle,</b> <b>fat,</b> <b>liver,</b> kidney, milk and eggs). These values are estimated using three approaches transfer factors, interpolation and linear regression as described in OECD, 2013 and allow the user to derive the maximum residue level (MRL) for each commodity of animal origin. Inputs to the tool are the following; monitoring and risk assessment residue definitions, residue levels measured in <b>muscle,</b> <b>fat,</b> <b>liver,</b> kidney and milk or eggs (at different feeding levels obtained from livestock feeding studies), STMR and HR values for crop groups used as animal feed including; forage, roots and tubers, cereal grains and crop seeds and by-product, for by-products a processing factor (PF) can be entered by user. However, in the absence of this input value, default processing factors are provided for many of the by-product classes. If residue definitions in raw and processed commodities are different, user has to enter the corresponding conversion factor(s).

It {{is obvious that the}} interaction is influenced by numerous variable parameters, which are divided into three categories: needle geometries, insertion methods, and tissue characteristics. A series of experiments are performed to explore the effect of influence factors (material samples n= 5 for each factor) on the insertion force. Data were collected from different biological tissues and a special tissue-equivalent phantom with similar mechanical properties, using a 1 -DOF mechanical testing system instrumented with a 6 -DOF force/torque (F/T) sensor. The experimental results indicate that three basic phases (deformation, insertion, and extraction phase) are existent during needle penetration. Needle diameter (0. 7 - 3. 2 mm), needle tip (blunt, diamond, conical, and beveled) and bevel angle (10 - 85 °) are turned out to have a great influence on insertion force, so do the insertion velocity (0. 5 - 10 mm/s), drive mode (robot-assisted and hand-held), and the insertion process (interrupted and continuous).

The depletion profile of SDZ and TMP was studied in healthy pigs, after oral administration of 1. 5 kg OPTIPRIME® per ton of feeding stuff, for 5 consecutive days. A total of 22 pigs at age 65 ± 2 days and from 27. 1 - 33. 0 kg were used. The experimental animals were divided into 4 groups (5 pigs per group), while 2 pigs acted as control animals. All medicated pigs were sacrificed 1, 4, 7 and 11 days after the last administration and <b>muscle,</b> <b>fat,</b> <b>liver</b> and kidney tissues were collected and analyzed using a validated liquid chromatography-mass spectrophotometry method. On the 1 st day post medication (pm), SDZ was found in muscle and fat at higher concentrations than TMP, whereas higher concentrations of TMP were found in the liver, while both substances were found in high concentrations in kidney samples. On 4 th day pm SDZ and TMP could not be quantified or detected in any tissue. On 7 th day pm, both substances were found in quantifiable concentrations in 1 out of 4 kidney samples, while on 11 th day pm, all observations were below the Limit of Quantification (LOQ) of the method.

40|$|S u m m a r y Civilization- related {{diseases}} can {{be defined}} as those caused by the effects of harmful factors resulting from the development of civilization, the progressive industrialization and changes in lifestyle that derive from the use of achievements of modern civilization. Abdominal obesity and diabetes are the most typical examples of such ailments. Insulin resistance underpins the obesity and type 2 diabetes ’ twin epidemics and explains many of the metabolic problems that, linked together, are called a metabolic syndrome. It is defined as a glucose homeostasis disorder, in terms of reduced sensitivity of <b>muscle,</b> <b>fat,</b> <b>liver</b> and other body tissues to insulin. There are three possible mechanisms of insulin resistance: pre-receptor, receptor and post-receptor. Insulin resistance may not be the only and the basic problem of the patient directly leading to impaired glucose metabolism in the form of diabetes. It may be an additional issue, related to another disease the patient is suffering from, and leading to serious complications, including diabetes. This is due to a variety of hormonal disorders occurring in various diseases and leading to the emergence of resistance to insulin. Most of the hormones diminish the effect of insulin in the body in the mechanism of action of the liver and the peripheral tissues. The hormones that in excess most often cause carbohydrate metabolism disorders include growth hormone, thyroxine, glucocorticoids, catecholamine, parathyroid hormone, aldosterone, glucagon and somatostatin. The effect of their activity is hyperinsulinemia resulting from the compensatory rise in insulin secretion in response to increasing insulin resistance. The awareness of insulin resistance prevalence in different globally widely spread disease entities and the understanding of the mechanisms leading to it should contribute to taking better care of patients originally being treated because of other reasons...|$|E
40|$|Background: There is {{increasing}} evidence that unacylated ghrelin (UAG) improves insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis; however, the mechanism for {{this activity is}} not fully understood since a UAG receptor has not been discovered. Methodology/Principal Findings: To assess potential mechanisms of UAG action in vivo, we examined rapid effects of UAG on genome-wide expression patterns in <b>fat,</b> <b>muscle</b> and <b>liver</b> of growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) -ablated mice using microarrays.

40|$|SummaryBlood glucose {{levels are}} tightly controlled, a process {{thought to be}} orchestrated {{primarily}} by peripheral mechanisms (insulin secretion by β cells, and insulin action on <b>muscle,</b> <b>fat,</b> and <b>liver).</b> The brain also plays an important, albeit less well-defined role.

To understand the relevance of this, we are manipulating glucose sensing within glucose-excited neurons. In the present study, we demonstrate that glucose excitation of MCH-expressing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus is mediated by KATP channels and is negatively regulated by UCP 2 (a mitochondrial protein that reduces ATP production), and that glucose sensing by MCH neurons {{plays an important role}} in regulating glucose homeostasis.

In this study, the enrofloxacin concentrations in plasma and tissues were detected using high-performance liquid chromatography with phosphate buffer (pH = 3) and acetonitrile. The pharmacokinetics and elimination of enrofloxacin enteric-coated granules were performed after oral administration at a single dose of 10 mg/kg body weight (bw) and 5 mg/kg twice per day for 5 consecutive days, respectively. The in vivo antibacterial efficacy and clinical effectiveness of enrofloxacin enteric-coated granules against APP and MS were assayed at 2. 5, 5, 10 mg/kg, compared with tiamulin (8 mg/kg) based on establishment of APP and MS infection models. 56 APP strains were selected and tested for in vitro antibacterial activity of enrofloxacin enteric-coated granules. The main parameters of elimination half-life (t 1 / 2 β), Tmax, and area under the curve (AUC) were 14. 99 ± 4. 19, 3. 99 ± 0. 10, and 38. 93 ± 1. 52 μg h/ml, respectively, revealing that the enrofloxacin concentration remained high and with a sustainable distribution in plasma. Moreover, the analysis on the evaluation of enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin in <b>muscle,</b> <b>fat,</b> <b>liver</b> and kidney showed that the recovery were more than 84 % recovery {{in accordance with the}} veterinary drug residue guidelines of United States pharmacopeia, and the withdrawal periods were 4. 28, 3. 81, 4. 84, and 3. 51 days, respectively, suggesting that the withdrawal period was 5 d after oral administration of 5 mg/kg twice per day.

30|$|Insulin {{resistance}} plays a {{major role}} in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Insulin resistance is defined as a state in which the body loses its ability to respond to insulin which is a key factor in the development of diabetes mellitus. Research has stated that the development of insulin resistance is closely associated with obesity, cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes mellitus along with immune cell infiltration and inflammation [229]. In this condition the <b>muscle,</b> <b>fat,</b> and <b>liver</b> cells are likely to have a decreased responsiveness and cannot absorb glucose easily from the bloodstream and do not respond properly to insulin. As a result, the body demands higher levels of insulin to provide glucose entry into cells. To balance this demand, the beta cells in the pancreas also produce more insulin. As long as the beta cells are able to produce enough insulin to overcome the insulin resistance, blood glucose levels stay in the healthy range. Beta cells have two insulin receptors. If one of them gets insensitive to insulin, the other insulin receptor is activated by a different pathway, which leads to beta cell proliferation.|$|R

AMPK is also a molecular target of 5 -aminoimidazole- 4 -carboxamide- 1 -b-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), which {{has been shown to}} reduce insulin resistance in various animal models. Here we aim to determine whether the therapeutic effects of AICAR against insulin resistance involve its anti-inflammatory function, which requires macrophage SIRT 1. Long-term administration of low-dose AICAR significantly suppressed adipose inflammation in established diet-induced obese mice. This was associated with improved glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity without changes of body weight. In contrast, SIRT 1 deletion in myeloid SIRT 1 knockout (MSKO) mice increased infiltration of classically activated M 1 macrophages and decreased alternatively activated M 2 macrophages in adipose tissue. As a result, MSKO mice on high fat (HF) diets exhibited impaired insulin signaling in skeletal <b>muscle,</b> <b>fat,</b> and <b>liver,</b> and developed systemic insulin resistance in glucose tolerance tests, insulin tolerance tests, and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp experiments. Interestingly, the beneficial effects of AICAR on adipose inflammation and insulin sensitivity were absent in MSKO mice fed HF diets, suggesting that the full capacity of AICAR to antagonize obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance requires myeloid SIRT 1.

40|$|Finding ways {{to reduce}} risk for obesity-related disorders, {{including}} type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, is important. Such approaches can include lifestyle interventions by diet and exercise. Our ancestors in the Paleolithic Era ate a diet based on vegetables, fruit, berries, lean meat, fish, seafood, nuts and eggs. Cereals, dairy products and legumes were not {{a significant part of}} the diet before the agricultural revolution, and neither were added sugar or salt. Furthermore, our ancestors were much more physically active compared to the average Western population. Contemporary hunter-gatherers like the Kitava Islanders and the Greenlandic Inuit eat a diet similar to that of the Paleolithic Era and have a strikingly low frequency of cardiovascular events. Detailed studies of the metabolic effects of the Paleolithic diet, with and without exercise, are therefore warranted. Impaired insulin sensitivity is a key factor in the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In this thesis, insulin sensitivity was measured with the gold-standard examination – the hyperinsulinemic– euglycemic clamp – and also with fasting blood samples and the oral glucose tolerance test. We found the fasting index Revised QUICKI to be the best choice if the time-consuming gold-standard examination is not feasible. However, to distinguish insulin sensitivity of different tissues like skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue, the hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamp is preferred. In our studies, the Paleolithic diet improved cardiovascular risk factors like overweight, insulin sensitivity, <b>liver</b> <b>fat,</b> triglycerides and blood pressure in obese, postmenopausal women. All study participants decreased <b>liver</b> <b>fat</b> when eating a Paleolithic diet. Six months of Paleolithic diet improved weight, <b>liver</b> <b>fat</b> and triglycerides significantly more than a conventional low-fat diet in obese, postmenopausal women. It was difficult for the women to remain adherent to the Paleolithic diet for 2 years, however, and most cardiovascular risk factors showed some degree of deterioration between 6 and 24 months. In individuals with type 2 diabetes, a Paleolithic diet for 12 weeks improved weight, insulin sensitivity, HbA 1 c, triglycerides and blood pressure. Exercise training did not improve these cardiovascular risk factors beyond the changes observed with the Paleolithic diet alone. The 12 -week Paleolithic diet intervention also reduced <b>muscle</b> <b>fat</b> and <b>liver</b> <b>fat,</b> but exercise training reversed this effect. A Paleolithic diet has strong effects on <b>fat</b> content in <b>liver</b> and muscle and on insulin sensitivity.

This interaction produces mechanical perturbation and a potential for bioeffects on nearby cells or tissues. In vitro, sonoporation and cell death occur at mechanical index (MI) values less than the inertial cavitation threshold. In vivo, bioeffects reported for MI values greater than 0. 4 include microvascular leakage, petechiae, cardiomyocyte death, inflammatory cell infiltration, and premature ventricular contractions and are accompanied by gas body destruction within the capillary bed.

Cre/loxP technology has allowed the generation of cell-selective knockout models targeting the androgen receptor (AR) in distinct putative target cells {{in a wide variety}} of organs and tissues including: testis, ovary, accessory sex tissues, <b>muscle,</b> bone, <b>fat,</b> <b>liver,</b> skin and myeloid tissue. In some androgen-regulated processes such as spermatogenesis and folliculogenesis this approach has lead to the identification of a key cellular mediator of androgen action (Sertoli and granulosa cells, respectively). In many target tissues, however, the final response to androgens appears to be more complex. Here, cell-selective knockout technology offers a platform upon which we can begin to unravel the more complex interplay and signaling pathways of androgens. A prototypic example is the analysis of mesenchymal-epithelial interactions in many accessory sex glands. Furthermore, for some actions of testosterone, in which part of the effect is mediated by the active metabolite 17 β-estradiol, conditional knockout technology offers a novel strategy to study the relative contribution of AR and estrogen receptor-mediated signaling. The latter approach has already resulted in a better understanding of androgen action in brain and bone. Finally, cell-selective knockout technology has generated valuable models to search for AR-controlled molecular mediators of androgen action, a strategy that has successfully been applied to the study of androgen action in the testis and in the epididymis. Although some conditional knockout models have provided clear answers to physiologic questions, it should be noted that others have pointed to unexpected complexities or technical limitations confounding interpretation of the results. status: publishe...|$|R

30|$|For each patient, {{up to five}} {{volumes of}} {{interest}} (VOI) were defined manually within the largest primary tumor structure. One whole-tumor VOI was defined on the low dose CT of the first PET/CT scan (VOICT). Additionally, VOI were defined on the averaged PET image acquired over time interval 4 – 4.5  h p.i.; to investigate possible differences in kinetics within tumor tissue, up to three VOI were defined in areas showing relatively high (VOIHigh), average (VOIAvg), and low (VOILow) PET signal, as determined visually {{with the aid of}} thresholding. In addition, as most tumors featured an area with markedly low PET signal, possibly indicating necrosis, a whole-tumor VOI was defined where this area was excluded (VOIViable). For comparison, VOI in several healthy tissues (<b>muscle,</b> lung, <b>fat,</b> and <b>liver</b> tissue; when visible within the PET field of view) were defined manually onto the low dose CT image, taking care to avoid tissue boundary limits. All VOI were defined by the same person and manually adjusted to exclude large blood pool structures identified on early PET frames showing the tracer in the arterial blood vessels. VOI were then projected onto the full dynamic PET scan to derive TAC.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to study the effect of dietary supplementation of Euphorbia heterophylla {{on the quality of}} the Guinea pig meat. Forty guinea pigs were divided into two groups fed ad libitum during 46 days a Panicum maximum diet (Panicum diet) or a mixed diet (75 % Panicum maximum + 25 % Euphorbia heterophylla) (Paneuphorbia diet) to compare their effects on {{performances}} and on the composition of guinea pig tissues and carcass. Daily weight gain, liver weight, carcass yield, and the lipid content of both the carcass and the perirenal fat were significantly increased by the Paneuphorbia diet. Feeding Paneuphorbia diet increased (P< 0. 05) the n- 3 PUFA content in perirenal <b>fat,</b> <b>muscle,</b> <b>liver</b> and in the carcass and decreased (P< 0. 05) the n- 6 /n- 3 ratios in all these tissues and the carcass. In conclusion, this study shows that Euphorbia heterophylla is a source of n- 3 fatty acids which can improve significantly the n- 3 PUFA content of Guinea pig meat and carcass...|$|R

50|$|In animal {{models of}} obesity and {{diabetes}} {{it was found}} to improve insulin sensitivity and lower plasma glucose levels in <b>fat,</b> <b>muscle</b> and <b>liver</b> tissue, and increased mitochondrial and metabolic function. In mice rendered obese and diabetic by feeding a high-fat, high-sugar diet, a study performed at the National Institute of Aging found that feeding chow infused with the highest dose of SRT1720 beginning at one year of age increased mean lifespan by 18%, and maximum lifespan by 5%, as compared to other short-lived obese, diabetic mice; however, treated animals still lived substantially shorter lives than normal-weight mice fed normal chow with no drug. In a later study, SRT1720 increased mean lifespan of obese, diabetic mice by 21.7%, similar to the earlier study, {{but there was no}} effect on maximum lifespan in this study. In normal-weight mice fed a standard rodent diet, SRT1720 increased mean lifespan by just 8.8%, and again had no effect on maximum lifespan.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Some Ficus {{species have}} been used in {{traditional}} African medicine in the treatment of diabetes. The antidiabetic potential of certain species has been confirmed in vivo but the mechanism of activity remains uncertain. The aim was to investigate the hypoglycaemic potential of ten Ficus species focussing on glucose uptake, insulin secretion and the possible mechanism of hypoglycaemic activity. METHODS: The dried and ground leaves of ten Ficus species were extracted with acetone. The dried acetone extract was reconstituted with DMSO to a concentration of 100 mg/ml which was then serially diluted and used to assay for glucose uptake in <b>muscle,</b> <b>fat</b> and <b>liver</b> cells, and insulin secretion in pancreatic cells. RESULTS: Only the F. lutea extract was able to modulate glucose metabolism. In comparison to insulin in the primary muscle cells, the glucose uptake ability of the extract was 33 % as effective. In the hepatoma cell line, the extract was as effective as metformin in decreasing extracellular glucose concentration by approximately 20 %. In the pancreatic insulin secretory assay, the extract was 4 times greater in its secretory activity than commercial glibenclamide. With F. lutea extract significantly increasing glucose uptake in the primary <b>muscle</b> cells, primary <b>fat</b> cells, C 2 C 12 muscle and H- 4 -II-E liver cells, the extract may act by increasing the activity of cell surface glucose transporters. When the 3 T 3 -L 1 pre-adipocytes were compared to the primary <b>muscle,</b> primary <b>fat</b> and C 2 C 12 cells, the differences in the former’s ability to transport glucose into the cell {{may be due to the}} absence of the GLUT 4 transporter, which on activation via the insulin receptor decreases extracellular glucose concentrations. Because the pre-adipocytes failed to show any active increase in glucose uptake, the present effect has to be linked to the absence of the GLUT 4 transporter. CONCLUSION: Only F. lutea possessed substantial in vitro activity related to glucose metabolism. Based on the effect produced in the various cell types, F. lutea also appears to be a partial agonist/antagonist of the insulin cell membrane receptor. While the clinical effectiveness of F. lutea is not known, this plant species does possess the ability to modify glucose metabolism.
