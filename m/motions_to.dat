5|$|One of {{the most}} {{contentious}} issues facing the newly elected government was {{the decision of the}} province's capital city. The federal legislation creating the province had fixed Edmonton as the provisional capital, much to the chagrin of Calgary. Neither party had taken a position on the divisive question during the campaign, but selecting a permanent capital was {{high on the list of}} the new legislature's orders of business. Calgary's case was made most enthusiastically by Minister of Public Works Cushing, Edmonton's by Attorney-General Cross. Banff and Red Deer were also possibilities, but <b>motions</b> <b>to</b> select each failed to find seconders. In the end, Edmonton was designated by a vote of sixteen members—including Rutherford—to eight.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} <b>motions</b> <b>to</b> glorify Vasil Levski as a saint of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. However, {{historian}} Stefan Chureshki has emphasised that while Levski's post-monastical life {{was one of}} a martyr, it was incompatible with the Orthodox concept of sainthood. Chureshki makes reference to Levski's correspondences, which show that Levski threatened wealthy Bulgarians (чорбаджии, chorbadzhii) and traitors with death, endorsed theft from the rich for pragmatic revolutionary purposes and voluntarily gave up his religious office to devote himself to the secular struggle for liberation.|$|E
5|$|A {{plate of}} hard horny tissue {{at the tip}} of the beak of all birds in the family Anatidae (ducks, geese and swans). This shield-shaped structure, which {{sometimes}} spans the entire width of the beak, is often bent at the tip to form a hook. It serves different purposes depending on the bird's primary food source. Most species use their nails to dig seeds out of mud or vegetation, while diving ducks use theirs to pry molluscs from rocks. There is evidence that the nail may help a bird to grasp things; species which use strong grasping <b>motions</b> <b>to</b> secure their food (such as when catching and holding onto a large squirming frog) have very wide nails. Certain types of mechanoreceptors, nerve cells that are sensitive to pressure, vibration or touch, are located under the nail.|$|E

5|$|The basal ganglia—the part of {{the brain}} most {{prominently}} affected in early HD—play a key role in movement and behavior control. Their functions are not fully understood, but current theories propose that they are {{part of the}} cognitive executive system and the motor circuit. The basal ganglia ordinarily inhibit a large number of circuits that generate specific movements. To initiate a particular movement, the cerebral cortex sends a signal to the basal ganglia that causes the inhibition to be released. Damage to the basal ganglia can cause the release or reinstatement of the inhibitions to be erratic and uncontrolled, which results in an awkward start to motion or <b>motions</b> <b>to</b> be unintentionally initiated, or a motion to be halted before, or beyond, its intended completion. The accumulating damage to this area causes the characteristic erratic movements associated with HD. The spontaneous and erratic physical movements associated with HD are classified as a type of hyperkinetic dysarthria. Because of the basal ganglia's inability to inhibit movements, individuals affected by it will inevitably experience a reduced ability to produce speech and swallow foods and liquids (dysphagia).|$|E
5|$|Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U.S. 652 (2004), is a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court {{declined}} to overturn a state court's conclusion that a minor was not in custody for Miranda purposes during his police interview. Michael Alvarado helped his friend Paul Soto steal a truck in Santa Fe Springs, California. The truck owner was killed by Soto during the robbery and Alvarado was convicted of second-degree murder {{for his role in the}} crime. The evidence for Alvarado's conviction was primarily based on statements given by Alvarado during a two-hour police interrogation that occurred when Alvarado's parents brought him to the police station. Alvarado was 17 years old and was not read his Miranda rights before questioning. During Alvarado's murder trial in a state court, <b>motions</b> <b>to</b> suppress the statements given by Alvarado were denied on the ground that Alvarado was not in police custody at the time of the interrogation and thus did not have to be read his Miranda rights. Alvarado appealed his conviction, claiming that the determination that he was not in custody was incorrect because the courts did not take his age into account.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaur {{evolution}} {{after the}} Triassic follows changes in vegetation {{and the location}} of continents. In the late Triassic and early Jurassic, the continents were connected as the single landmass Pangaea, and there was a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of coelophysoid carnivores and early sauropodomorph herbivores. Gymnosperm plants (particularly conifers), a potential food source, radiated in the late Triassic. Early sauropodomorphs did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food in the mouth, and so must have employed other means of breaking down food farther along the digestive tract. The general homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into the middle and late Jurassic, where most localities had predators consisting of ceratosaurians, spinosauroids, and carnosaurians, and herbivores consisting of stegosaurian ornithischians and large sauropods. Examples of this include the Morrison Formation of North America and Tendaguru Beds of Tanzania. Dinosaurs in China show some differences, with specialized sinraptorid theropods and unusual, long-necked sauropods like Mamenchisaurus. Ankylosaurians and ornithopods were also becoming more common, but prosauropods had become extinct. Conifers and pteridophytes were the most common plants. Sauropods, like the earlier prosauropods, were not oral processors, but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food in the mouth, including potential cheek-like organs to keep food in the mouth, and jaw <b>motions</b> <b>to</b> grind food. Another notable evolutionary event of the Jurassic was the appearance of true birds, descended from maniraptoran coelurosaurians.|$|E

5|$|On August 10, 2001, on remand {{from the}} Florida Second District Court of Appeal, Judge Greer heard a motion from the Schindlers {{claiming}} that new medical treatment could restore sufficient cognitive ability such that Terri Schiavo herself {{would be able}} to decide to continue life-prolonging measures. The court also heard motions from the Schindlers to remove the guardian (Michael Schiavo) and to require Judge Greer to recuse himself. Judge Greer denied the motions and the Schindlers appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals. On October 17, 2001 the Court of Appeal affirmed the denials of the <b>motions</b> <b>to</b> remove and recuse. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that their opinion misled the trial court, and they remanded the question of Terri Schiavo's wishes back to the trial court and required an evidentiary hearing to be held. The court specified that five board certified neurologists were to testify. The Schindlers were allowed to choose two doctors to present findings at an evidentiary hearing while Michael Schiavo could introduce two rebuttal experts. Finally, the trial court itself would appoint a new independent physician to examine and evaluate Terri Schiavo's condition. (These decisions, all published in a single order by the Florida Second District Court of Appeal, came to be known by the court as Schiavo III in its later rulings.) In October 2002, on remand by the Second District Court of Appeal, an evidentiary hearing was held in Judge Greer's court to determine whether new therapy treatments could help Terri Schiavo restore any cognitive function. In preparation for the trial, a new computed axial tomography scan (CAT scan) was performed, which showed severe cerebral atrophy. An EEG showed no measurable brain activity. The five physicians chosen were Dr. William Maxfield, a radiologist, and four neurologists: Dr. William Hammesfahr, Dr. Ronald Cranford, Dr. Melvin Greer and Dr. Peter Bambakidis.|$|E

50|$|In {{legislative}} bodies, the <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> rescind is {{used for}} much the same purpose as the <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> reconsider; many court decisions treat the two motions as one motion. However, in legislative contexts, {{it is not the}} same as a <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> repeal. The difference between rescind and reconsider is that the <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> rescind is ordinarily applied to actions that have been taken and are already in effect. It has been described as being in the nature of a <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> amend by striking out the entire proposal and leaving nothing remaining. It is not in order when the question can be reached by a <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> reconsider. Once legislation has been actually enacted, it is too late to rescind. The vote required to rescind is the same as would be required to repeal the act which it sought to rescind (usually a majority).|$|R

50|$|The {{use of the}} <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> lay on {{the table}} <b>to</b> kill a <b>motion</b> is improper; instead, a <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> {{postpone}} indefinitely should be used. Similarly, it is improper <b>to</b> use the <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> lay {{on the table to}} postpone something; a <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> postpone to a certain time should be used in this case. If debate is not desired, a <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> close debate (the previous question) should be used. One of the disadvantages of trying to kill a measure by laying it on the table is that, if some opponents of the measure subsequently leave the meeting, a temporary majority favoring the measure can then take it from the table and act on it; or they may do so at the next session if held within a quarterly time interval.|$|R
