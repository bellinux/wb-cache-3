When the machine receives acceptance message from respective account holder it will allow accessing the account. If the acceptance message not received the access will be denied. To achieve this we are using Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) technology. The microcontroller which we are using is a mid range PIC microcontroller. For scanning we are using IR based sensor setup.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} analog speech encryption algorithms. It focuses specifically on schemes which are able to be used over narrowband communication channels, such as the Public Switched Telephone Network. The performance of the devices studied is evaluated according to three criteria. The scrambled speech derived from the encryption algorithm must have a low residual intelligibility. The encryption and decryption processes should have a minimal effect {{on the quality of}} the speech recovered by the intended recipient. Finally, the scrambler <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>secure</b> <b>from</b> cryptanalytic attack. Time domain, frequency domain and combined time and frequency domain scrambling procedures are considered initially. A review of their respective advantages and disadvantages is included which aims to facilitate the development of improved speech security systems. Original methods for the cryptanalysis of time element and frequency domain bandsplitting scramblers are presented. These attacks are applicable when the cryptanalyst has access to the scrambled speech only. In particular a novel cryptanalytic procedure is introduced which exploits the redundancy of speech using a frequency domain vector codebook. Attacks are also described which utilise plaintext with corresponding ciphertext to recover the encryption permutations used in the encryption process. It is shown that the two scramblers examined, are extremely vulnerable to the proposed cryptanalytic techniques...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{consists}} of musings that originate mainly from conversations with other physicists, as together we’ve tried {{to learn some}} cryptography, but also from conversations {{with a couple of}} classical cryptographers. The main thrust of the paper is an attempt to explore the ramifications for cryptographic security of incorporating physics into our thinking at every level. I begin by discussing two fundamental cryptographic principles, namely that security must not rely on secrecy of the protocol and that our local environment <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>secure,</b> <b>from</b> a physical perspective. I go on to explain why by definition a particular cryptographic task, oblivious transfer, is inconsistent with a belief in the validity of quantum mechanics. More precisely, oblivious transfer defines states and operations that do not exist in any (complex) Hilbert space. I go on to argue the fallaciousness of a “black box ” approach to quantum cryptography, in which classical cryptographers just trust physicists to provide them with secure quantum cryptographic sub-protocols, which they then attempt to incorporate into larger cryptographic systems. Lest quantum cryptographers begin to feel too smug, I discuss the fact that current implementations of quantum key distribution <b>are</b> only technologically <b>secure,</b> and not “unconditionally ” <b>secure</b> as <b>is</b> sometimes claimed. I next examine the concept of a <b>secure</b> lab <b>from</b> a physical perspective, and end by making som...|$|R

5000|$|One {{approach}} {{to prevent such}} attacks {{involves the use of}} a certificate authority, a trusted third party responsible for verifying the identity of a user of the system. This authority issues a tamper-resistant, non-spoofable digital certificate for the participants. Such certificates are signed data blocks stating that this public key belongs to that person, company, or other entity. This approach also has its weaknesses - for example, the certificate authority issuing the certificate <b>must</b> <b>be</b> trusted to have properly checked the identity of the key-holder, must ensure the correctness of the public key when it issues a certificate, <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>secure</b> <b>from</b> computer piracy, and must have made arrangements with all participants to check all their certificates before protected communications can begin. Web browsers, for instance, are supplied with a long list of [...] "self-signed identity certificates" [...] from PKI providers - these are used to check the bona fides of the certificate authority and then, in a second step, the certificates of potential communicators. An attacker who could subvert any single one of those certificate authorities into issuing a certificate for a bogus public key could then mount a [...] "man-in-the-middle" [...] attack as easily as if the certificate scheme were not used at all. In an alternate scenario rarely discussed, an attacker who penetrated an authority's servers and obtained its store of certificates and keys (public and private) would be able to spoof, masquerade, decrypt, and forge transactions without limit.|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Mobile Ad-hoc {{networks}} (MANETs) have various characteristics like mobility, infrastructure less, spontaneously {{created and}} can be established in any environment without pre-existing infrastructure with ease of deployment. Due to these characteristics of MANETs {{they can be used}} for various applications. However to use MANETS in commercial purpose they <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>secured</b> <b>from</b> malicious attackers. Providing security to MANETs is difficult due to vulnerability of wireless links, the limited physical protection of nodes, the dynamically changing topology, the absence of a certification authority, and the lack of a centralized monitoring or management point. Various trust based routing protocols are discovered to provide security and better throughput by detecting and eliminating malicious nodes from the network but trust computation is a highly challenging task due to independent characteristics of MANETs.

Crypto servers are the main areas of attacking as they deal with securing the data that flow in-between several components of the embedded systems. Most of the attacking systems suggested in the literature suffer from lack of experimental models to emulate the attacking system. An attacking system could be amply proved when several samples of data are used for attacking and the samples of data provide for knowledge base.

The increasing usage of digital control and computer systems, for supervisory control and data acquisition in the control rooms of new generation nuclear reactors, has introduced several cyber security issues that <b>must</b> <b>be</b> addressed. One {{of the most significant}} problems is that this new technology has increased the vulnerability of the nuclear power plant to cyber security threats.

In order to address these issues and ensure that a digital control system <b>is</b> safe and <b>secure</b> <b>from</b> undesirable intrusions, the system must go through extensive tests and validation. These tests will verify that systems are safe and properly functioning. The vulnerabilities of a nuclear power plant can be determined through conducting cyber security exercises, cyber security attacks scenarios, and simulated attacks. All these events can be performed using the control room in the nuclear power plant, but it is a complicated and hampered process because of the complex hardware and software interactions that <b>must</b> <b>be</b> considered. Control rooms are also not ideal places to test various cyber attacks and scenarios because any mishap can lead to detrimental impacts on the nearby surroundings. This research attempts to present our approach to build a comparative testbed that captures the relevant complexity of a nuclear power plant.
