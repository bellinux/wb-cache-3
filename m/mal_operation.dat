This paper proposes {{a new technique}} for set-ting all Over Current (OC) relays in substations, process industries with cogeneration and distribution system with Embedded Renewable Generation. This technique is more suitable {{where there is a}} drastic change in the fault current based on the network topology and configuration. It is based on an appropriate equivalent circuit of the power grid to estimate the required short-circuit currents. This technique is used in setting the OC relays of an IEEE 30 Bus system, Real time steel industry and a Real time distribution system with Embedded Renewable Generation. Plug setting, Time Dial setting and Type of curve are optimized which results in better coordination in terms protection of components and maintaining the time interval between down stream and upstream relays. There is a significant reduction in fault clearing time which reduces the damage and enhance the stability. In addition, it also prevents all the <b>mal</b> <b>operation</b> of relays and nuisance tripping. This concept will helpful in developing the auto setting relays in the future. Process industries with cogeneration and medium voltage transmission system are potential application for proposed methodology...|$|E
40|$|A Power Quality {{problem is}} an {{occurrence}} as a nonstandard voltage, current or frequency {{that results in}} a failure or <b>mal</b> <b>operation</b> of end user equipment. Power Quality (PQ) measures {{a wide range of}} power supply characteristics that can influence the performance of equipment and processes. The concept of custom power is to use power electronics in the voltage distribution system aiming to supply reliable and high quality power to sensitive users. Out of different custom power devices, the dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) is used to mitigate the voltage sag at the terminal of sensitive load. Several control methods are proposed for the DVR.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is Current Transformer Transient {{response}} study using an electromagnetic Transient program (EMTP). Current transformers are considered eyes for power system protection. Behaviours of protection systems depend largely on information fed to them by instrument transformers. Ferromagnetic current transformers have for many years provided practical method of current measurement, however there are limitations associated with current transformer operation:- notably, difficult in maintaining accuracy over {{the full range of}} operating conditions, and most particularly current transformers tendency to suffer saturation of iron core during severe faults, with accompanying severe ratio or loss of output. These limitations might lead to <b>mal</b> <b>operation</b> of protective relays due to distorted inputs from current transformers particularly in transient periods. This thesis involved studying the behaviour of current transformers in both steady state and transient periods. An emphasis being put on transient periods which are very crucial in behaviour of current transformers because transformation errors are greatest in these periods. Errors in current transformer transformation might affect operation of entire protection schemes. Maloperation of current transformers in transient periods have very bad effect on relay co-ordination and worst condition might be failure of protection scheme operation altogether. Over the past decades engineers have been trying to develop a current transformer model that would represent a current transformer well in transient periods. It has proved to be rather difficult {{to come up with a}} single detailed model that would satisfy all possible conditions. This is due to non-linearity of magnetising curve and saturation effects of current transformer iron cores. The author has considered different current transformer models with their merits and demerits being highlighted. It has been shown that different current transformer models have to be used when considering different operating conditions of a current transformer in a power system. ATP-EMTP an Electromagnetic Transient Program was developed in the sixties for the study of electromagnetic transients in power systems. It has proved to be a very useful tool in this regard. The program development is still going on today to accommodate a wide application in power systems. Several components have been developed to represent different components in a power system. It is only recently that there has been a growing interest to include modelling of protective equipment. This has been accelerated by the inclusion of MODELS in the EMTP program. This thesis explores the effect of transients taking into account different conditions like transient fault currents, effects of high frequency waves and surges. Effects of different types of burdens on current transformers were explored as well. Due to limitations of EMTP, simulation results are only applicable to current transformers with ARMCO M 4 oriented steel with ungapped cores. The author arrived at several conclusions. The most important conclusion is that <b>mal</b> <b>operation</b> of protective relays due to current transformer saturation can be avoided easily if proper current transformer selection is given priority in power protection design. EMTP package proved to be very useful and handy when studying transients though one has to be careful with numerical oscillations which might be present during simulations. Problems of numerical oscillations have been discussed under current transformer simulation tools...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- This paper proposes an {{algorithm}} for CT saturation by {{behavior of}} distorted secondary current. The purpose of current transformer is {{to convert the}} primary current in the secondary circuit in a most accurate way. However, during fault conditions CT gets saturated. Some reasons due to current transformer (CT) can saturate like: attempting to <b>mal</b> <b>operation</b> of CT, heavy burden apply on the secondary side or due to transient DC offset fault current. Fortunately, due to the ever changing nature of the alternating current, even if the CT is pushed into saturation, in each cycle of the waveform, there are times during which magnetic core comes out of saturation. During these times the transformation of CT is correct {{but as soon as}} the magnetic core enters in to deeper saturation the current transformer will start exhibiting enormous errors. Thus, the key to correct these errors is to detect the instant when the saturation sets in and the instant when saturation ends. The idea of linear predictive coding (an autoregressive model) is to express the nth sample of signal as a sum of the past K known weighted samples. When analyzing disturbance signals the optimal prediction coefficients will change for each system state (e. g. pre-fault, fault and post fault) and therefore must be estimated continuously. The method for CT saturation detection that has been simulated is, CT saturation detection using linear predictive coding, in this method can successfully detect the onset of CT saturation. The test results clearly indicate that the proposed algorithm successfully detects the interval o...|$|E
40|$|Annexes {{end of the}} chapterWith {{the heavy}} use of {{sophisticated}} equipment several problems arise related to electricity, within the user's premises and to the nearby users and to the utility. People tend to use the equipment, which save time, reduce labor and increase productivity of the office/industrial environment. Those equipment such as fax machine, photocopiers, printers, computers, CFLs, VSDs etc. comprises with electronic circuits, which consume harmonics. When Harmonics are injected to the system several problems such as frequent breaker tripping, Error in meter readings, <b>mal</b> <b>operation</b> of relays, capacitor bank blasting, Telephone interference, overheating of conductors and transformers, over loading of neutral conductor, higher losses in conductors and transformers etc. can happen. Harmonic currents generated by modem office/industrial equipment cause power system heating and add to user power bills. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the harmonic related losses in several electrical systems and quantify its energy usage in cost wise. How site selection was done, the type of equipment used to gather data and the process of data analysis which are the key elements which this study is based upon are described in separate chapters. The analysis shows that building-wiring losses related to powering non-linear electronic load equipment might be more than double the losses for linear load equipment. Current related power losses such as 12 R, Skin Effect of conductors, Proximity Effect of Conductors are considered. A special emphasis is made upon the underlined theories, which the study is based upon which includes defining harmonics, generating sources, theirs adverse impacts, adopted methods of measuring or identifying, other methods of eliminating etc. i...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to design a damping controller for a thyristor controlled series capacitor (TCSC) to damp robustly inter-area oscillations in power systems with an immunity against sub-synchronous resonance (SSR) oscillations which may lead to torsional oscillations. The new control strategy has two main loops; an SSR mitigation loop and a bang-bang loop, the latter is designed {{with the aim of}} damping inter-area oscillations with a settling time 8 - 10 sec. The appropriate selection of the bang-bang series compensation component, âKC, is addressed by considering the Eigen analysis of the generatorsâ shafts and an impedance scan of the series compensated line for different compensation levels. The SSR mitigation loop is designed with the aim of providing a fine tune control signal {{to be added to the}} main value of the inserted series compensation (KC), to damp SSR oscillations and related torsional mode of oscillations. To address this issue, a new observer-based multiple model adaptive control algorithm is designed to control a multi-stage TCSC. The SSR modelling challenges associated with the load dynamics and with the insertion of the series compensation into the transmission system are overcome by a fine tuning control loop, which adjusts the resultant series compensation (KC). Considering the integration and coordination of oscillation damping and distance protection in the transmission system, a new adaptive technique must be designed to control the distance relay (DR) to prevent its <b>mal</b> <b>operation</b> (during the damping process). The new strategy is illustrated through an 11 -bus 4 -machine 2 -area benchmark power system. The performance and advantages of the new algorithm are validated using time domain simulation via PSCAD software...|$|E
