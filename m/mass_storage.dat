5|$|Though most {{computers}} since mid-2004 can boot from USB <b>mass</b> <b>storage</b> devices, USB is {{not intended}} as a primary bus for a computer's internal storage. Buses such as Parallel ATA (PATA or IDE), Serial ATA (SATA), or SCSI fulfill that role in PC class computers. However, USB has one important advantage, {{in that it is}} possible to install and remove devices without rebooting the computer (hot-swapping), making it useful for mobile peripherals, including drives of various kinds (given SATA or SCSI devices may or may not support hot-swapping).|$|E
5|$|Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) was {{designed}} by Microsoft to give higher-level access to a device's filesystem than USB <b>mass</b> <b>storage,</b> {{at the level of}} files rather than disk blocks. It also has optional DRM features. MTP {{was designed}} for use with portable media players, but it has since been adopted as the primary storage access protocol of the Android operating system from the version 4.1 Jelly Bean as well as Windows Phone 8 (Windows Phone 7 devices had used the Zune protocol which was an evolution of MTP). The primary {{reason for this is that}} MTP does not require exclusive access to the storage device the way UMS does, alleviating potential problems should an Android program request the storage while it is attached to a computer. The main drawback is that MTP is not as well supported outside of Windows operating systems.|$|E
5|$|USB {{implements}} {{connections to}} storage devices using {{a set of}} standards called the USB <b>mass</b> <b>storage</b> device class (MSC or UMS). This was at first intended for traditional magnetic and optical drives and has been extended to support flash drives. It has also been extended to support {{a wide variety of}} novel devices as many systems can be controlled with the familiar metaphor of file manipulation within directories. The process of making a novel device look like a familiar device is also known as extension. The ability to boot a write-locked SD card with a USB adapter is particularly advantageous for maintaining the integrity and non-corruptible, pristine state of the booting medium.|$|E

5|$|The {{magneto-optical}} drive manufactured by Canon Inc. {{was used as}} the primary <b>mass</b> <b>storage</b> device. These drives were relatively new to the market, and the NeXT was the first computer to use them. They were cheaper than hard drives (blank media especially so: though each had a cost of $150 to Canon, Jobs's typically forthright negotiations saw Canon agree to a retail of only $50 apiece) but slower (with an average seek time of 96 ms). The design made it impossible to move files between computers without a network, since each NeXT Computer had only one MO drive and the disk could not be removed without shutting down the system. Storage options proved challenging for the first NeXT Computers. The magneto-optical media was relatively expensive and had performance and reliability problems despite being faster than a floppy drive. The drive was not sufficient to run as the primary medium running the NeXTSTEP operating system both in terms of speed and capacity.|$|E

This paper presents a method of managing rationally and storing mass data based on distributed computing technique.

The model can overcome the existing deficiencies of the current means of storage and {{solve the problems of}} <b>mass</b> data in <b>storage,</b> which has good scalability and reliability, thus the efficiency of storage can be further improved...|$|R
25|$|The TOSHIBA {{optical drive}} {{used in the}} unit can read Compact Discs and DVDs in {{addition}} to HD DVDs when connected to a host that supports reading these formats (such as a PC). As the drive communicates via a generic <b>mass</b> <b>storage</b> protocol over USB the drive {{can be used as}} a standard optical drive on computers and operating systems that support USB optical drives. The operating system must have a UDF 2.5 driver to read data from HD DVDs. In addition a software player capable of playing HD DVD titles is required for playback of video. The 256MB internal Memory Unit on the drive which is used for storage of HD DVD features is also accessible by manually installing USB <b>Mass</b> <b>Storage</b> drivers. Once installed, this can be formatted for use as a storage device although it will no longer function on an Xbox 360 unless it is reformatted.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{questions}} that is being addressed at present by SDI Multimegawatt Space Power Project {{is whether or not}} space weapon power systems must be closed, i. e., whether effluents from the systems are tolerable. If they are not tolerable, the major penalty that must be paid to close space systems is increased mass. Open systems remove waste heat by producing effluents, e. g., hot hydrogen gas. Closed systems require radiators, thermal <b>storage</b> <b>masses,</b> effluent <b>storage,</b> or refrigeration to remove waste heat. The mass penalty incurred by addition of these devices is so severe that the option of closing space power systems should be avoided if at all possible.

40|$|Application {{performance}} is criterion for distributed storage system evaluation, {{and hence the}} specific task of system configuration and performance tuning for these application is of great interest. The effectiveness of automatic storage management depends on {{the accuracy of the}} storage performance models that are used for making resource optimization configuration.

Although the potential advantages of distributed file system in application workloads have been documented, the potential impact to application performance in <b>mass</b> distributed <b>storage</b> environments is not clearly understood. This paper presents a response time analysis approach based on fork-join queue model for distributed file system. The performance technique is potentially useful in the early phases of design distributed storage system when several candidate configurations have to be evaluated quickly.
