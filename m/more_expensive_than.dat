5|$|The {{product of}} a quadruple VAM (vacuum arc melting) process, {{combined}} with hot extruding and different rolling applications is cured using high-pressure, high-temperature gas autoclaving.

5|$|Zinc {{production}} {{with the}} ISP is <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>than</b> with electrolytic zinc plants, so several smelters operating this technology have closed in recent years.

5|$|A related process, {{flux-cored}} {{arc welding}} (FCAW), uses similar equipment but uses wire {{consisting of a}} steel electrode surrounding a powder fill material. This cored wire is <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>than</b> the standard solid wire and can generate fumes and/or slag, but it permits even higher welding speed and greater metal penetration.|$|E

5|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} produce significant, although usually mild, {{side effects}} including drowsiness, hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation. Sometimes side effects appear {{even at a}} minimal clinically effective dose, leading the physician {{to search for a}} different drug. Agonists have been related to impulse control disorders (such as compulsive sexual activity, eating, gambling and shopping) even more strongly than levodopa. They tend to be <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>than</b> levodopa.|$|E
5|$|The total costs, {{including}} all alterations, were £513,242 for Glatton and £777,197 for Gorgon, {{although there was}} no obvious reason for the disparity unless some of Glatton's costs had been charged against Gorgon as the lead ship of the class. A truer cost would be about £645,000 for each. This was almost double the original cost and made them <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>than</b> any of the other monitors.|$|E

5|$|Titanium alloys {{are used}} in {{spectacle}} frames that are rather expensive but highly durable, long lasting, light weight, and cause no skin allergies. Many backpackers use titanium equipment, including cookware, eating utensils, lanterns, and tent stakes. Though slightly <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>than</b> traditional steel or aluminium alternatives, titanium products can be significantly lighter without compromising strength. Titanium horseshoes are preferred to steel by farriers because it is lighter and more durable.|$|E
5|$|When {{platinum}} {{was declared}} a strategic government resource during World War II, many jewelry bands were {{made out of}} palladium. As recently as September 2001, palladium was <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>than</b> platinum and rarely used in jewelry because of the technical difficulty of casting. Currently, the casting problem has been resolved and use in jewelry has increased because platinum has increased in price while palladium decreased.|$|E
5|$|A {{conservative}} Washington D.C. think tank, and a Republican {{member of}} Congress, among others, {{have claimed that}} Gore has a conflict-of-interest for advocating for taxpayer subsidies of green-energy technologies {{in which he has}} a personal investment. Additionally, he has been criticized for his above-average energy consumption in using private jets, and in owning multiple, very large homes, one of which was reported in 2007 as using high amounts of electricity. Gore's spokesperson responded by stating that the Gores use renewable energy which is <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>than</b> regular energy and that the Tennessee house in question has been retrofitted to make it more energy-efficient.|$|E

5|$|A {{new line}} to Rodeløkka was opened on 3 January 1955. The bus {{operation}} had been <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>than</b> the tram, and a double track line was built from Carl Berners plass through Dælenenggata to Rodeløkka. The balloon loop was {{built around the}} block of Dælenengata, Fagerheimgata, Marstrandgata and Københavngata. The line {{was connected to the}} old Rodeløkka Line with a triangular loop in Københavngata. On 23 April 1961, all traffic on the Rodeløkka Line was terminated. The tracks were removed between 1962 and 1964.|$|E
5|$|In many {{developing}} countries, the ketogenic diet is expensive because dairy fats and meat are <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>than</b> grain, fruit and vegetables. The modified Atkins diet {{has been proposed}} as a lower-cost alternative for those countries; the slightly more expensive food bill can be offset by a reduction in pharmaceutical costs if the diet is successful. The modified Atkins diet is less complex to explain and prepare and requires less support from a dietitian.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{production}} {{in the twentieth century}} relied on treatment with hot, concentrated sulfuric acid in cast iron vessels, followed by selective precipitation by dilution with water, as on the subsequent steps. This method relied on the specifics of the technique and the concentrate grain size; many alternatives have been proposed, but only one has proven effective economically: alkaline digestion with hot sodium hydroxide solution. This is <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>than</b> the original method but yields a higher purity of thorium; in particular, it removes phosphates from the concentrate.|$|E

5|$|Neon gives a {{distinct}} reddish-orange glow {{when used in}} low-voltage neon glow lamps, high-voltage discharge tubes and neon advertising signs. The red emission line from neon also causes the well known red light of helium–neon lasers. Neon is used in some plasma tube and refrigerant applications but has few other commercial uses. It is commercially extracted by the fractional distillation of liquid air. Since air is the only source, it is considerably <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>than</b> helium.|$|E

5|$|Paleoenvironmental {{evidence}} shows that between the 9th and 11th centuries the area around Buckton Castle was cleared of woodland.

The earliest castles in England typically used timber, at least {{when they were first}} built, and building in stone was <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>than</b> earth and timber. It became more common to use stone in 12th-century castles, and Buckton is amongst the earliest masonry castles in North West England.|$|E
