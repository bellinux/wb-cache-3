This article intends to make three contributions to this debate. First, it aims to conceptualize and operationalize security culture as a translation process.

Result shows that the system layer includes the unreasonable land compensation, the lack of social security for land-losing farmers, and the employment exclusion of land-losing farmers. Small scale and low heterogeneity are the causations for social support network. Low willingness to become citizens, low cultural quality and difficulty in role change are the causations of land-losing farmers themselves. The low expected return and high living cost are the causations for economic layer. Based on the above analysis, countermeasures to improve the urban-living ability of land-losing farmers are put forward, such as improving the land expropriation system, establishing a <b>multi-level</b> social <b>security</b> system, enhancing the training and employment mechanism of land-losing farmers, and improving the quality of land-losing farmers.

More recently, however, MAC has evolved out of the MLS niche and has started to become more mainstream.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} status of citizenization of land-losing farmers, {{problems}} in the citizenization are analyzed, such as the difficulty in land-losing farmers’ economic life after turning into citizens, employment difficulties of land-losing farmers after living in the city, and the prominent problems in social security of land-losing farmers. Causations for the citizenization problems of land-losing farmers are analyzed. Firstly, institutionalized rejection {{is the root of}} the obstacle in citizenization of land-losing farmers. Secondly, exclusion from social security system is a fundamental reason. Thirdly, exclusion of land-losing farmers from both urban citizens and themselves is the subjective factor. Fourthly, exclusion of land-losing farmers from urban employment is the objective factor. Based on these, countermeasures are put forward: formulating a reasonable price of land transfer; establishing a reasonable land compensation and benefit-sharing mechanism; setting up a <b>multi-level</b> social <b>security</b> system for land-losing farmers; increasing the human capital investment in land-losing farmers to enhance their employment status; and improving the cultural quality of land-losing farmers to realize the change in lifestyle.

We alter the transparency of exchanges between non-adjacent parties. We find transparency of the exchanges between the investor and intermediary does not significantly affect welfare. However, transparency regarding exchanges between the intermediary and borrower promotes trust {{on the part of}} the investor, increasing welfare. Further, this has asymmetric effects: borrowers and intermediaries achieve greater welfare benefits than investors. We discuss implications for what specific aspects of financial market transparency may facilitate more efficiency. financial intermediation, financial market transparency, pass through <b>securities,</b> <b>multi-level</b> trust games, experiments...|$|R

Recent developments in technology have increased the ability to detect these threats. However, the average {{amount of time it}} takes to screen a passenger still remains a concern. This paper models the queueing process for a <b>multi-level</b> airport checkpoint <b>security</b> system, where multiple security classes are formed through subsets of specialized screening devices. An optimal static assignment policy is obtained which minimizes the steady-state expected amount of time a passenger spends in the security system. Then, an optimal dynamic assignment policy is obtained that maximizes the number of true alarms while maximizing passenger throughput. Performance of a two-class system is compared to that of a selective security system. The key contribution is that the resulting optimal assignment policies increase security and passenger throughput by efficiently and effectively utilizing available screening resources. 1...|$|R

They {{are devoted to}} include in Diffractive Optically Variable Image Devices (DOVIDs) that are {{currently}} widely used for security needs. CGRHs prevent counterfeiting due {{to the complexity of}} recreation, on the one hand, and allow the simple identification at the first (visual) level of verification, on the other hand. To record it, the Electron Beam Lithography (EBL) is used. As recently proved, this method is a most promising for <b>multi-level</b> optical-digital <b>security</b> devices using chalcogenide glasses as resists. The CGRH computation process is conventionally divided by two parts: synthesizing and recording. On the synthesis stage, firstly, the geometrical and optical constants of recording scheme are determined; secondly, the basic parameters accounting for discretization of Interferogram Data (ID) in hologram plane are defined and, finally, the calculation of the ID - the array of Bipolar Intensity (BI) values - is carried out. This calculation is performed separately in each independent horizontal slice of object space and hologram plane. On the recording stage, suitable quantization parameters are chosen and transformation of ID into the multilevel rectangle data appropriate for EBL is accomplished. The investigations on optimization of synthesis and recording of the multilevel CGRHs of 3 D images integrated in Polygrams are presented here. So the rules for definition of the appropriate discretization parameters were finding out. Advantages of using non-linear quantization that implies condensing of quantization levels near the BI zero were explored. The random deviation of location and direction of elemental hybrid radiating area was applied. Practical applications of the method developed were made using chalcogenide semiconductors of various As-S-Se compositions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Data {{aggregation}} {{is a key}} challenging task in wireless senor {{network to}} reduce energy consumption and ensures the data reliability and <b>security.</b> <b>Multi-level</b> data aggregation techniques ensure security and reliability of data aggregation {{in the presence of}} secure routing. Every movement of data must be followed by secure routing via the dynamically distributed secure node list to ensure the secure path. Three different levels of aggregation are used to add for more security and so it reduces the time consumption of the network. In the first level, the sensors senses its own signal or it may receive from adjacent sensors and checks the duplication then forward it to the nearest storage node in its region, where the storage nodes are special than the ordinary sensor nodes due to additional computation with high resource capacity. In the second level, the storage node receives from sensors and it senses itself and checks the duplication and also it tries to avoid the very closer data to be transmitted. In the Final level, the base station receives the data from the storage nodes and generates the whole data set for its own region based on session ID. The session and region based data sets are used for data aggregation and to store the sensed data. The session based secure keys are used to protect the data and it is controlled by distributed data server. Due to very sensitive data transmission, two different encryptions are applied in high level data aggregation and shield the data for each and every level by using the digital signature to add more security on data...|$|R
