5|$|In early 1922 Marquis started {{considering}} {{working as}} an Indian agency physician. This would both satisfy his longstanding interest in the Native Americans of the West, and provide a subject that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> interest to publishers. In May, Marquis applied to the Civil Service Commission. While waiting, he began work on a novel, Boute, an unfinished story based on his wartime experiences. In June, Marquis was appointed agency physician to the Northern Cheyenne. He arrived in the agency village of Lame Deer, Montana, in early July.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt, both appreciating Willkie's talents, {{and seeking}} to {{divide and conquer}} his opposition, had been mulling over ways his former {{opponent}} <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> use. The president's onetime advisor, Justice Felix Frankfurter, had suggested to Van Doren on New Year's Eve that Willkie should travel across the Atlantic to demonstrate bipartisan support of Britain. Willkie had already been planning a visit in support for Britain. Roosevelt believed that the visit of the nominal head of the opposition party {{would be far more}} effective in demonstrating American support than sending one of his advisors.|$|E
5|$|The island {{they arrived}} on {{turned out to}} be {{uninhabited}} with little food and no apparent water. After a camp had been set up ashore, White was sent back to the still floating Grasshopper to scavenge supplies. He boarded the vessel and descended below decks to search for any items that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> use. Whilst there, he felt Judy in the darkness, pinned in her bed under a row of lockers. He constructed a raft out of materials on the Grasshopper and rowed the items, along with Judy, back to the island. The lack of water was becoming an issue, until Judy began to dig at a point on the waterline. It took a couple of minutes, but Judy managed to unearth a fresh-water spring and was credited with saving everyone's lives. During the first night, the magazine on the Grasshopper finally caught light and exploded, sinking the vessel. The survivors continued to camp on the beach for the following few days, with Judy protecting them from snakes.|$|E

5|$|Three {{months later}} royalist general Pío Tristán {{advanced}} {{in the north}} with more than three thousand men, prepared to invade the United Provinces. Once again outnumbered by larger armies, Belgrano organised a great exodus {{of the city of}} Jujuy: the entire population of the city would have to retreat with the army and not leave behind anything that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> value to the royalists (such as animals, crops, or housing). By September a proper formation of columns provided them with a victory against a royalist task force of 500men during the Battle of Las Piedras. The First Triumvirate commanded Belgrano to retreat to Cordoba without fighting, but he thought that doing so would mean the loss of the northern provinces. Thus, instead of continuing to Cordoba, he was convinced by the people of San Miguel de Tucumán to make a stand there. His forces had increased by then to nearly 1,800 soldiers, still much less than the 3,000 at Tristan's command. Even so, he obtained a victory in the Battle of Tucumán. By that time, the First Triumvirate was replaced by the Second Triumvirate, which provided greater support for Belgrano. The Second Triumvirate called the Assembly of Year XIII soon after taking power, which was intended to declare independence and enact a national constitution, but failed to do so because of political disputes between the members. It did not take measures regarding the national flag, but allowed Belgrano to use the blue and white flag as the flag of the Army of the North.|$|E

25|$|Nephila spiders {{vary from}} reddish to greenish yellow in color with {{distinctive}} whiteness on the cephalothorax {{and the beginning}} of the abdomen. Like many species of the superfamily Araneoidea, they have striped legs specialized for weaving (where their tips point inward, rather than outward as is the case with many wandering spiders). Their contrast of dark brown/black and green/yellow allows warning and repelling of potential predators to whom their venom <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> little danger.|$|E
25|$|More {{sophisticated}} algorithms {{depend on}} the material type covered. Organic compounds might be searched for {{on the basis of}} certain molecular fragments. Inorganic compounds, on the other hand, <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> interest with regard to a certain type of coordination geometry. More advanced algorithms deal with conformation analysis (organics), supramolecular chemistry (organics), interpolyhedral connectivity (‘non-organics’) and higher-order molecular structures (biological macromolecules). Search algorithms used for a more complex analysis of physical properties, e.g. phase transitions or structure-property relationships, might apply group-theoretical concepts.|$|E
25|$|The {{carnitine}} {{content of}} seminal fluid {{is directly related}} to sperm count and motility, suggesting that the compound <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> value in treating male infertility. Several studies indicate that carnitine supplementation (2–3 grams/day for 3–4 months) may improve sperm quality, and one randomized, double-blind crossover trial found that 2 grams/day of carnitine taken for 2 months by 100 infertile men increased the concentration and both total and forward motility of their sperm. The reported benefits may relate to increased mitochondrial fatty-acid oxidation (providing more energy for sperm) and reduced cell death in the testes.|$|E
