50|$|<b>Micaceous</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> (MIO) {{is another}} {{alternative}} to lead for protection of steel, giving more protection against water and light damage than most paints. When MIO pigments are ground into fine particles, most cleave into shiny layers, which reflect light, thus minimising UV degradation {{and protecting the}} resin binder. Most pigments used in paint tend to be spherical, but lamellar pigments, such as glass flake and MIO have overlapping plates, which impede the path of water molecules. For optimum performance MIO should have a high content of thin flake-like particles resembling mica. ISO 10601 sets two levels of MIO content. MIO is often derived from a form of hematite.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{examined the}} feasibility of using flux modification {{in the form of}} the addition of oxidizing ingredients to reduce the as-deposited hydrogen content of basic-type shielded metal arc welds. Additions of up to 16. 3 % <b>micaceous</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> (MIO) to the flux formulation of an E 7018 - 1 type electrode lowered the diffusible weld hydrogen content by approximately 70 %. This can be attributed to the formation of oxygen, which lowers the partial pressure of hydrogen in the arc atmosphere, and the reaction of FeO (formed on dissociation of MIO) with hydrogen. The partitioning of deoxidizing elements (manganese and silicon) between the weld metal and slag on addition of MIO to the flux coating was also examined, but the influence of flux additions on the weld mechanical properties and the electrode operating characteristics was not evaluated during the course of this investigation...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the performance of}} solventborne paint systems applied on carbon steel and hot-dip galvanized steel {{in a wide range}} of atmospheric exposures. The study has involved paint systems exposure for 3. 5 years in eight natural atmospheres. The atmospheric conditions cover from temperate rural climates to tropical severe marine and Antarctic coastal regions. The paint systems included several alkyds formulated with a variety of pigments (anticorrosive and barrier), epoxies, chlorinated rubber, and zinc-rich (ethyl silicate and epoxy). It has been concluded that in rural and urban atmospheres alkyd systems afford equivalent anticorrosive protection of steel to the epoxy/polyurethane system. The toxic red lead pigment may be replaced in long linseed-oil alkyd primer paints by non-toxic pigments, such as a mixture of <b>micaceous</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxides</b> (MIO) and black <b>iron</b> <b>oxides</b> or zinc phosphate, without affecting the anticorrosive properties of the paint system.

40|$|This project {{examined}} {{the feasibility of}} using flux modification to reduce the as-deposited hydrogen content of basic-type shielded metal arc welds. Additions of oxidizing ingredients (<b>micaceous</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxides)</b> to the reference flux formulation lowered the diffusible weld hydrogen content by up to 70 %. Increasing amounts of silica caused a slight reduction in hydrogen content, probably {{as a result of}} the reaction between SiO 2 and CaF 2, which produces SiF 4 and CaO as reaction products. Flux formulations containing additions of fluorine-containing compounds and calcite displayed lower hydrogen levels, with the diffusible weld metal hydrogen content reaching a minimum with increasing additions. Higher levels caused an increase in the weld hydrogen content. Thermodynamic slag modelling attributes the existence of these minima to a decrease in slag water capacity with an increase in slag fluorine content (at constant basicity), brought about by higher concentrations of fluorine-containing compounds in the flux formulation. The effect of flux additions on the weld mechanical properties and the electrode operating characteristics was not evaluated during the course of this investigation.

30|$|A Missouri Department of Transportation report (Myers et al. 2010) on {{structural}} steel coatings for corrosion mitigation mentions that drainage {{of water from}} the deck onto the superstructure was the primary factor leading to service failures of the coating. It was reported that inorganic zinc primers were effective at hindering corrosion; however, organic zinc primer had higher adhesive strengths. The document also reported that overcoating provides an alternative maintenance option that reduces cost and disruption of the highway system; however, it comes with an increased level of risk of early failure of the newly applied system (as opposed to the full blast and repaint approach). Additionally, polyurea type coatings were reported to be effective at producing bond strength, but the salt-induced corrosion inhibition was not as strong as the systems with a high solid zinc primer. Organic zinc primer was reported to be more effective due to higher adhesive strengths and a lower probability of the primer peeling off. A promising review of the application of <b>micaceous</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> zinc primer with aliphatic polyurea polyaspartic topcoat system was reported to have almost equal performance in terms of salt-fog resistance when compared to blast cleaning and application of a zinc rich primer.

In the present work, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) has been used as binder for development of anticorrosive coating. Since non-polar characteristics of LDPE make its adhesion poor to most substrates, polar groups have been introduced in LDPE by grafting maleic acid (MAc) using reactive extrusion method. Grafted LDPE was characterized by chemical method, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) and melt flow index (MFI). Grafted LDPE was pigmented with different pigments such as red iron oxide, <b>micaceous</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> (MIO), titanium dioxide (TiO 2) and aluminium at three concentrations (i. e., 20, 30 and 40 %). These compositions were applied on grit blasted mild steel specimen by flame spray technique. The coated specimens were evaluated for adhesion strength and resistance to corrosion in salt spray, humidity and seawater. Red iron oxide-based composition showed better adhesion and corrosion resistance compared to other compositions.

The oily CRM sludge contains lots of valuable iron and alloying elements, along with plenty of hazardous organic components, which makes it an attractive secondary resource and an environmental contaminant at the same time At present, oily CRM sludge is mainly used as smelting raw materials Its direct re-use in sintering may lead to some problems because high oil content of oily CRM sludge results in increased emission of volatile organic compounds including dioxins and can lead to problems in waste gas purification systems, e. g glow fires in electrostatic precipitators.

METHODS: The labeling of mesenchymal stem cells was performed using the superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran complexed and not complexed to poly-L-lysine. Superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran was incubated with poly-L-lysine in an ultrasonic sonicator at 37 °C for 10 minutes for complex formation superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine by electrostatic interaction. Then, the mesenchymal stem cells were incubated overnight with the complex superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine and superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran. After the incubation period the mesenchymal stem cells were evaluated by internalization of the complex superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine and superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran by Prussian Blue stain. Cellular viability of labeled mesenchymal stem cells was evaluated by cellular proliferation assay using 5, 6 -carboxy-fluorescein-succinimidyl ester method and apoptosis detection by Annexin V- Propidium Iodide assay. RESULTS: mesenchymal stem cells labeled with superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran without poly-L-lysine not internalized efficiently the superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles due to its low presence detected within cells. Mesenchymal stem cells labeled with the complex superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine efficiently internalized the superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles due to greater presence in the cells interior. The viability and apoptosis assays demonstrated that the mesenchymal stem cells labeled and not labeled respectively with the superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine continue to proliferate over seven days and the percentage of cells in early or late apoptosis is low compared to the percentage of live cells over the three days.

In the present study, {{the influence of}} reaction temperatures (30, 45 and 80 °C) on the morphology, particle size and crystallinity of the <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> particles were investigated in detail. Based on the Malvern Zetasizer analysis, the <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> particles with variable size from ∼ 250 to ∼ 70 nm could be achieved when increasing the reaction temperature up to 80 °C. The magnetite phase of <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> particles was determined by using X-ray diffraction analysis. In addition, field emission scanning electron microscopy micrographs were further affirmed that our synthesised <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> particles were in nano-scale with a spherical shape. It {{was found that the}} high reaction temperature is helpful in controlling the formation of uniform magnetite <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles...|$|R
30|$|Although {{there have}} been many {{significant}} progresses in the synthesis of organic materials functionalized <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> NPs, simultaneous control of their shape, stability, biocompatibility, surface structure, and magnetic properties is still a challenge. As an alternative, inorganic compound functionalized <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> NPs can greatly enhance the antioxidation properties for naked <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> NPs, and its corresponding scope of application has been greatly extended. Moreover, inorganic compounds functionalized <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> NPs are very promising for application in catalysis, biolabeling, and bioseparation. The applied coating inorganic materials include silica, metal, nonmetal, metal oxides, and sulfides. Composite NPs can roughly be divided into two major parts: preserved the magnetic property of <b>iron</b> <b>oxides</b> and preserved the other properties of inorganic materials.|$|R

These materials were prepared with synthetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> and characterized by powder XRD, SEM, FTIR, TPR and Mössbauer spectroscopy. Results showed that the main <b>iron</b> <b>oxides</b> formed were goethite (aFeOOH) and maghemite (gFe 2 O 3) with small particle size. The <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> and <b>iron</b> oxide/niobia composite showed high adsorption ability for organic compounds. The positive enthalpy indicated an endothermic adsorption process suggesting physical adsorption...|$|R

In Lebanon <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> has a red color instead of the brown beige color which is common in {{northern}} countries. The reason is a different chemical reaction caused by the high temperature which produces {{a different kind of}} <b>iron</b> <b>oxide.</b>|$|R
