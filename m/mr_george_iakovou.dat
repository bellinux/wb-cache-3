60|$|COLLINS. Oh, <b>Mrs</b> <b>George</b> gets round her. <b>Mrs</b> <b>George</b> can get round anybody if {{she wants}} to. And then <b>Mrs</b> <b>George</b> is very {{particular}} about religion. And shes a clairvoyant.|$|R
6000|$|Five minutes afterward, the {{carriage}} which <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> had engaged {{arrived at the}} door. <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> and the children came down the stairs. <b>Mr.</b> <b>George,</b> {{as soon as he}} reached the lower hall, inquired,-- ...|$|R
60|$|Rollo did so. He {{followed}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> down {{stairs to}} the door, and they both got into a small carriage which <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> had waiting there and drove away together towards <b>Mr.</b> <b>George's</b> hotel.|$|R
60|$|Rollo {{pointed it}} out to <b>Mr.</b> <b>George.</b> <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> {{said it was a}} cardinal's carriage.|$|R
60|$|It is one <b>Mr.</b> <b>George,</b> it appears. Without other {{announcement}} or ceremony, <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> walks in.|$|R
60|$|The {{commissioner}} {{knocked at}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>George's</b> {{door at the}} time appointed. <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> and Rollo were both ready. <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> counted out the fifteen guilders on the table, and James put them in his pocket. The party then set out.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>George</b> {{liked and}} admired Lucinda. Now, when <b>Mrs.</b> <b>George</b> liked and admired any person, {{it was a}} matter of {{necessity}} with her to impart her opinions to the most convenient confidant. In this case it was Romney Penhallow to whom <b>Mrs.</b> <b>George</b> remarked sweetly: ...|$|R
60|$|So saying, {{he looked}} into <b>Mr.</b> <b>George's</b> face, and waited to see if <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> had any {{objection}} to his going.|$|R
60|$|So Henry {{assisted}} Rollo to dismount, {{and then}} adjusted the stirrups to <b>Mr.</b> <b>George's</b> use, and <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> mounted into the saddle.|$|R
6000|$|One {{day when}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> and Rollo arrived in Amsterdam, <b>Mr.</b> <b>George,</b> just at sundown, {{looked out at}} the window of the hotel, and said,-- ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> acceded to this proposal. The {{raspberries}} {{were two}} groschen a basket. <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> gave Rollo the money, and Rollo, going forward with it, bought the raspberries, {{and he and}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> ate them up together. They served the double purpose of a punishment for the offence, and of a dessert for the dinner.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> and Rollo took a cab {{and rode}} towards the city. Just after passing Temple Bar, <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> {{got out of the}} cab and went into an office. Rollo got out too, and amused himself walking up and down the sidewalk, looking in at the shop windows, while <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> was doing his business.|$|R
60|$|Having {{cast his}} sharp eye all about it, Mr. Bucket {{returns to his}} chair next his friend <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> and pats <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> affectionately on the shoulder.|$|R
60|$|MENTEITH. To be sure, <b>Mr.</b> <b>George.</b> (He goes out. Third cravat a success. Re-enter MENTEITH.) He says, <b>Mr.</b> <b>George,</b> {{that he has}} {{an errand}} from Miss Musgrave.|$|R
6000|$|The officer, {{finding the}} {{carriages}} generally full, said to <b>Mr.</b> <b>George,</b> in French, [...] "Wait a moment, sir." [...] So <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> {{said to the}} rest of the party-- ...|$|R
60|$|One morning while <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> and Rollo {{were taking}} breakfast {{together}} {{in the dining room}} of the hotel, <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> remarked that he had received some news that morning.|$|R
6000|$|Philippe {{then asked}} if the party would stop on the way and go down into Herculaneum. <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> said that they would. Philippe then went on with his calculation, {{and when it was}} {{finished}} he presented it to <b>Mr.</b> <b>George.</b> <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> wrote a heading to it, and then read it as follows, except that I give the amounts in American money:-- ...|$|R
60|$|But I {{must go back}} to <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> and Rollo. The coachman {{stopped at}} a large hotel, {{fronting}} upon this square. On inquiring at the bureau, (on the continent of Europe they call an office a bureau) <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> found that all the rooms were occupied except one large apartment, of four rooms. This was, of course, more than <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> wanted.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> and Rollo had no baggage, {{except a}} valise which they carried {{with them in}} the carriage. <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> took this valise up and stepped down upon the platform.|$|R
60|$|In {{about half}} an hour Rollo came up and told <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> that the dinner was ready. So <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> went down into the coffee room, Rollo showing him the way.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Parkman seemed {{extremely}} {{unwilling to}} allow <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> {{to pay any}} thing at all; but <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> insisted upon it, and so the bill was paid by a joint contribution.|$|R
60|$|So <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> and Rollo walked on, {{and about}} half an hour {{afterwards}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> engaged lodgings in a place near the junction of the Strand with Charing Cross, called Northumberland Court.|$|R
6000|$|When <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> and Rollo {{reached their}} hotel, and had got fairly {{established}} in their room, <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> took his cane {{and prepared to}} [...] "go exploring," [...] as he called it.|$|R
60|$|So, taking <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> by the hand, he led {{him along}} {{to the brink of}} the pier. <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> looked over, and saw the steamer lying at rest in its muddy bed below.|$|R
60|$|While <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> and Rollo were at {{the table}} {{drinking}} their coffee, <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> asked Rollo what he supposed the porter meant {{by saying that the}} eleven o'clock boat was a tidal boat.|$|R
6000|$|So <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> and the {{children}} got into the carriage, the driver holding {{the door open for}} them as they did so. As the driver was about to shut the door, <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> said,-- ...|$|R
60|$|The breakfast was {{now nearly}} finished, though {{the process of}} eating {{it had been a}} good deal impeded by the conversation, so large a share of it having fallen to <b>Mr.</b> <b>George.</b> <b>Mr.</b> <b>George,</b> however, {{explained}} to Rollo that their first day's journey from Basle would be south, towards Berne, the capital of the country--a city which was situated near the centre of the northern slope which <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> had described.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Peace!' said Mrs Wilfer, solemnly. 'I repeat, if <b>Mr</b> <b>George</b> Sampson attributes, to my {{youngest}} daughter, grovelling motives, he attributes them equally {{to the mother}} of {{my youngest}} daughter. That mother repudiates them, and demands of <b>Mr</b> <b>George</b> Sampson, as a youth of honour, what he WOULD have? I may be mistaken--nothing is more likely--but <b>Mr</b> <b>George</b> Sampson,' proceeded <b>Mrs</b> Wilfer, majestically waving her gloves, 'appears {{to me to be}} seated in a first-class equipage. <b>Mr</b> <b>George</b> Sampson appears to me to be on his way, by his own admission, to a residence that may be termed Palatial. <b>Mr</b> <b>George</b> Sampson appears to me to be invited to participate in the--shall I say the--Elevation which has descended on the family with which he is ambitious, shall I say to Mingle? Whence, then, this tone on Mr Sampson's part?' ...|$|R
60|$|On {{going along}} a little farther, Rollo pointed out another house to <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> where lamps were {{arranged}} for an illumination; and then, presently, another. <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> accordingly stopped {{to ask a}} policeman what it meant.|$|R
60|$|Here <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> rang a bell, and {{a waiter}} came in immediately. <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> handed the waiter a sovereign, {{and asked him}} to get change for it in French money. The waiter took the money, and {{presently}} came in with five five-franc pieces. These he presented very respectfully to <b>Mr.</b> <b>George.</b> <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> took two of them and gave them to Rollo. The others he put into his own pocket. The five-franc pieces were very bright and new, and they were of about the size of silver dollars. Rollo was very much pleased with his portion, and put them in his purse, quite proud of having so much spending money.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course they}} do; sprats to catch big fish with, <b>Mr.</b> <b>George.</b> And then the old gentleman {{has got a}} new lawyer; some sharp new light of Mr. Harcourt's recommending. Oh, <b>Mr.</b> <b>George,</b> <b>Mr.</b> <b>George!</b> do be careful, do now! Could not you go and buy a few ducks, or pigeons, and take them in a basket? The old gentleman does seem to like that kind of thing, though ten years since he was so different. Half a million of money, <b>Mr.</b> <b>George!</b> It's worth a few grapes and turkeys." [...] And Mr. Pritchett {{shook his head and}} wrung his hands; for he saw that nothing he said {{produced}} any effect.|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} he handed <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> {{a pencil and}} a piece of paper, which he took out of his pocket. <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> wrote down the list, and Rollo, taking it, went up to Mrs. Gray's room.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> {{brought up}} his valise, {{and placed it}} on the counter. A custom house officer, who had just {{examined}} and marked some other parcels, turned to <b>Mr.</b> <b>George's</b> just as he had unlocked and opened it.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Parkman {{seemed very}} much delighted, {{as well as}} surprised, to see <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> again; and <b>Mrs.</b> Parkman gave him quite a cordial greeting, {{although}} she half suspected that <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> did not like her very well.|$|R
60|$|The {{other guests}} of the inn came out upon the {{platform}} while Rollo and <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> were there, having wrapped themselves previously in their coats and shawls, as the evening air was cool. Some other parties of travellers came, too, winding their way slowly up the same pathway where <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> and Rollo had come. <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> and Rollo paid very little attention to these new comers, their minds being wholly occupied by the mountain.|$|R
60|$|The event {{showed that}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> {{was right in}} his calculations. The Hotel d'Amerique was full. The waiter, who came out, {{as soon as he}} saw the {{carriage}} stop at the door, told <b>Mr.</b> <b>George</b> this in French.|$|R
