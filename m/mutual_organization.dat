25|$|Stock exchanges {{originated}} as mutual organizations, {{owned by}} its member stock brokers. There {{has been a}} recent trend for stock exchanges to demutualize, where the members sell their shares in an initial public offering. In this way the <b>mutual</b> <b>organization</b> becomes a corporation, with shares that are listed on a stock exchange. Examples are Australian Securities Exchange (1998), Euronext (merged with New York Stock Exchange), NASDAQ (2002), Bursa Malaysia (2004), the New York Stock Exchange (2005), Bolsas y Mercados Españoles, and the São Paulo Stock Exchange (2007).|$|E

In January 1984 PSFS began expanding into financial service by buying a loan portfolio and mortgage business from General Electric Credit Corp. for US$568 million. In April 1985 the company acquired four savings and loans in Florida and began paying five cents per share quarterly dividend to stockholders. In September of that year, PSFS began doing business under the name Meritor Financial Group to emphasize its expansion into financial services. In 1986 Meritor began operating mutual funds through a subsidiary, completing {{the transition to a}} full-service financial institution.|$|E

25|$|The term carpet bag, which {{literally}} {{refers to}} a suitcase made from a piece of carpet, is used in several figurative contexts. The term gained a popular usage after the American Civil War to refer to carpetbaggers, Northerners {{who moved to the}} South after the war, especially during the Reconstruction era (1865–1877). Carpetbaggers allegedly politically manipulated and controlled former Confederate states for financial and power gains. In modern usage in the U.S., the term is sometimes used derisively to refer to a politician who runs for public office in an area where he or she does not have deep community ties, or has lived only for a short time. In the United Kingdom, the term was adopted to refer informally to those who join a <b>mutual</b> <b>organization,</b> such as a building society, in order to force it to demutualize, that is, to convert into a joint stock company, solely for personal financial gain.|$|E
2500|$|A {{building}} {{society is a}} financial institution owned by its members as a <b>mutual</b> <b>organization.</b> Building societies offer banking and related financial services, especially savings and mortgage lending. Building societies exist in the United Kingdom (UK) and Australia, [...] and used to exist in Ireland and several Commonwealth countries. They are similar to credit unions in organisation, though few enforce a common bond. However, rather than promoting thrift and offering unsecured and business loans, {{the purpose of a}} {{building society}} is to provide home mortgages to members. Borrowers and depositors are society members, setting policy and appointing directors on a one-member, one-vote basis. Building societies often provide other retail banking services, such as current accounts, credit cards and personal loans. The term [...] "building society" [...] first arose in the 18th century in Great Britain from cooperative savings groups.|$|E

Mutualization or mutualisation is the opposite process, wherein a shareholder-owned company is converted into a <b>mutual</b> <b>organization,</b> typically through takeover by an existing <b>mutual</b> <b>organization.</b> Furthermore, re-mutualization depicts the process of aligning or refreshing the interest and objectives {{of the members of the}} mutual society.|$|E
