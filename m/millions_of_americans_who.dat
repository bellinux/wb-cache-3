5000|$|According to Wayne La Pierre, as of May 2013, NRA {{membership}} exceeded 5 <b>million,</b> one-tenth <b>of</b> {{whom had}} {{joined in the}} prior six months.

Journalist Osha Gray Davidson suggested in 2000 that many deceased [...] "life members" [...] are kept on the books in order to inflate the membership rolls. A 2017 Pew Research Center Study {{found that more than}} 14 million Americans consider themselves NRA members, above the real membership number <b>of</b> 5 <b>million.</b> This may be attributed {{to the fact that the}} NRA has <b>millions</b> more <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>who</b> support them and will tell pollsters they are members, even when they are not.

40|$|The mass {{production}} of videotape recorders is altering {{the habits of}} television viewers throughout the world. In an historic decision, the Supreme Court in early 1984 ruled on the legality of home taping of broadcast television in the "Betamax " case, otherwise known as Universal Studios Inc. v.

The economic issues involved in this case are quite different from those encountered with copying from other mediums (e. g. photocopying). In these latter instances, the unauthorized copiers are potential consumers of the product and the producer of the authorized copies may or may not be able to indirectly appropriate revenues from these copiers [e. g. Liebowitz (1981, 1985), Besen (1984) ]. In the case of copying advertising supported broadcasts, the copier is not a potential customer, and the linkage betwee...|$|R
