5|$|A major {{report was}} {{published}} in January 1998 by The New York Times detailing Zardari's vast corruption and <b>misuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>funds.</b> The report discussed $200 million in kickbacks to Zardari and a Pakistani partner for a $4 billion contract with French military contractor Dassault Aviation, in a deal that fell apart only when the Bhutto government was dismissed. It contained details of two payments of $5 million each by a gold bullion dealer {{in return for a}} monopoly on gold imports. It had information from Pakistani investigators that the Bhutto family had allegedly accrued more than $1.5 billion in illicit profits through kickbacks in virtually every sphere of government activity. It also reported Zardari's mid-1990s spending spree, which included {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} spent on jewellery. The arrangements made by the Bhutto family for their wealth relied on Western property companies, Western lawyers, and a network of Western friends. The report described how Zardari had arranged secret contracts, painstaking negotiations, and the dismissal of anyone who objected to his dealings.|$|E

Sharing the constructive knowledge {{is a prerequisite}} for tackling settlements’ vulnerability, contrasting the imbalance between public and private. The research takes as a case study the historic urban landscape of Sassano in the Cilento National Park. Thirty years later the 80 ’s earthquake, built environments’ transformations are linked both to the lack of technical knowledge and to a <b>misuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> for reconstructing.

Fristacky said the project would deprive Melbourne of billions of dollars that were needed for the construction of the Melbourne airport railway, Doncaster railway line, Rowville line, Melbourne Metro and the Mernda rail extension.

30|$|In this paper, {{corruption}} {{is defined as}} practices {{in the public sector}} that lead to the <b>misuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> (see Shah 2006 for a detailed outline of corrupt practices). Not only does this include illegal activities but also ones that cause extra costs or else entail the under-provision <b>of</b> <b>public</b> goods or a loss of government revenue (other than losses merely associated with inefficient policies or behaviors). There are many examples of such practices, such as awarding a contract to a bidder even though their tender was not the best or to a bidder that deliberately under priced it with a view to pushing up the budget later. Other possible examples are awarding a concession based on unrealistic demand forecasts so that the public authorities finally have to pay de difference (e.g. forecast for the number of cars in highways, etc.), or changing zoning regulations that regulate land use to favor certain interest groups.|$|R
25|$|During the 1880s, Peirce's {{indifference}} to bureaucratic detail waxed while his Survey work's quality and timeliness waned. Peirce took years to write {{reports that he}} should have completed in months. Meanwhile, he wrote entries, ultimately thousands during 1883–1909, on philosophy, logic, science, and other subjects for the encyclopedic Century Dictionary. In 1885, an investigation by the Allison Commission exonerated Peirce, but led to the dismissal of Superintendent Julius Hilgard and several other Coast Survey employees for <b>misuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>funds.</b> In 1891, Peirce resigned from the Coast Survey at Superintendent Thomas Corwin Mendenhall's request.

Afterwards on 30 October 2017, Spain's top prosecutor announced that Carles Puigdemont and 13 other sacked Catalan cabinet ministers were being charged with rebellion, sedition, and <b>misuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>funds.</b> Puigdemont and 5 other cabinet ministers slipped out of Spain and fled to Brussels, Belgium that same day.

25|$|On 25 January 2017, the satirical weekly Le Canard enchaîné {{alleged that}} François Fillon {{employed}} his wife Penelope as his parliamentary assistant from 1998 and 2002 and {{for six months}} in 2012, with no evidence that she completed any substantial work. She collected a monthly salary of €3,900 to €4,600. After her husband's appointment as Minister of Social Affairs in 2002 and during his later tenure as Minister of National Education, {{she went on to}} serve until 2007 as a parliamentary aide to Marc Joulaud, Fillon's substitute, earning an increased salary upwards of €7,900 and with still no evidence of substantial work. The article claimed that she received a total of over €500,000 as a parliamentary aide, as well as €100,000 as a literary adviser to the Revue des deux Mondes. Its owner, billionaire Marc Ladreit de Lacharrière, is a close friend of François Fillon. While deputies in the National Assembly can employ family members, those are still required to complete legitimate work, evidence of which the paper was unable to find. Based on that information and on the same day, the PNF (parquet national financier, or national financial prosecutor's office) initiated a preliminary investigation into possible embezzlement and <b>misuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>funds.</b>|$|E

500|$|The premier {{was also}} known for his {{suspicious}} attitude towards the University of Adelaide and tertiary education in general; many of their graduates moved interstate and he thought that scientific research done within the state was not sufficiently focussed on practical applications. The antipathy was mutual and originated from Playford's days as a backbencher, when he formally complained to the university about a lecture given by {{a political science professor}} about Marxism. Playford saw the discussion of such a topic as <b>misuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>funds</b> for promotion of socialism, and his continued outspokenness about political curricula angered academics, who saw it as an attempt to curtail intellectual freedom. One vice-chancellor was angered to the point of telling a senior public servant that Playford [...] "an uneducated country colonial". Playford also opposed the establishment of a second university in the state as the population increased. While academics thought that another institution would bring more academic diversity, Playford thought this would increase competition for resources, so he allowed only a new campus of the University of Adelaide, which became Flinders University after his departure from power. In his defence, Playford pointed that he had never rejected a funding request since the state took responsibility for universities in 1951, and that his proportional expenditure on tertiary education matched that of other states.|$|E

On 16 March the investigation into Fillon was extended to [...] "aggravated fraud, forgery, and falsification of records". In particular, the probe sought to determine whether documents seized during {{a search of the}} National Assembly in March were forged in order to corroborate the veracity of Penelope Fillon's work as a parliamentary assistant. The investigation was also expanded into possible influence-peddling related to Fillon's consulting firm 2F Conseil, which was previously hired by billionaire Marc Ladreit de Lacharrière, owner of the Revue des deux Mondes, which employed Penelope Fillon. In 2013 de Lacharrière also provided a €50,000 loan to François Fillon, who failed to declare it as legally required. On L'Émission politique on 23 March, Fillon said that Bienvenue Place Beauvau, a book co-authored by Didier Hassoux of Le Canard enchaîné, suggested President Hollande ran a shadow cabinet to spread rumours about his opponents, a claim Hassoux subsequently denied. On 24 March, Marc Joulaud, Fillon's former substitute, was formally placed under investigation for embezzlement of public funds.

40|$|Privacy and the Information Society VThe {{right to}} privacy and freedom of {{information}} (FOI) and are two fundamental rights in democratic and transitional societies. They complement each other in holding government accountable to individuals, but they also overlap when request is made by an individual to disclose government information involving personal data about other individuals. With the rapidly evolving network society mediated by Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and the reforms in law in many countries, tension increases between the exercises of these two rights. Meanwhile, opportunities also arise to enhancing privacy protection against government surveillance in the aid of FOI. In China, the political priority on social stability has increased the potential for government surveillance and aggravated secrecy, notwithstanding the advancement of legislation in enhancing both personal privacy and government transparency. At the legislative level, the ground-breaking Regulation on Open Government Information 2007 has established a right for Chinese citizens to access government information in this party-state regime, and recognises privacy as an exemption to that right. At the same time, a series of legislation have been enacted since 2009 to recognize a general {{right to privacy}} or specific rights to protection of personal data, but fails to provide operable standards. In particular, there is an imbalance between legislative protection against intrusion by administrative authorities and that against violations by private bodies. Media reports show that, while the authorities are slow in protecting {{the right to privacy}} in other contexts, they frequently invoke the privacy exemption justify non-disclosure of government information. Given the lack of clear statutory definition <b>of</b> privacy, the <b>public</b> are concerned that privacy could be misused to shield government decisions form public scrutiny. Where valid privacy claims exist indeed in FOI context, people also question whether the better balance can be attained to both uphold individuals’ legitimate expectations of privacy and promote the public interests served by disclosure, such as identifying frauds in the distribution <b>of</b> welfare or <b>misuses</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>funds</b> by officials. The proposed paper reviews how the Chinese legislation and the implementing bodies (i. e. the courts) treat the two rights in the context where they are connected. It seeks to discover whether the enforcement of law has promoted the common values of both rights, including inter alia holding the government accountable to the public, and assess the quality of the approach to balancing these rights where their conflicts arouse great public concern. It will identify the inadequacies within the legal system, and make suggestions on the doctrinal development in judicial review as well as the reforms in future legislation...|$|R
