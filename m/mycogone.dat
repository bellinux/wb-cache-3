50|$|Hypomyces cervinigenus is a {{parasitic}} ascomycete fungus {{that grows}} on elfin saddle (Helvella) mushrooms in Europe and North America. It {{was described as}} new to science in 1971 by Clark Rogerson and Horace Simms. The type collection was made in Pierce County, Washington, where the fungus was found growing on the stipe and cap of what they identified as a fruit body of Helvella lacunosa; later molecular work demonstrated that the European H. lacunosa is not found in North America, and that the North American versions are in fact two similar species, H. vespertina and H. dryophila. H. cervinigenus has perithecia that are white to pale buff with a waxy texture. The ascospores are two-celled, smooth-walled, and measure less than 25 µm long. The anamorph form of the fungus is known as <b>Mycogone</b> cervina.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Mycogone</b> perniciosa (Magnus) Delacr., {{which causes}} wet bubble di-sease of Agaricus bisporus Lange (Imb), {{results in a}} {{considerable}} crop loss on mushroom farms in Serbia. The isolation and identification of five isolates of M. perniciosa from di-seased fruit bodies of white button mushroom from mushroom units in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Holland were made. Morpho-physiological characteristics and inter-rela-tionships of the obtained isolates were studied. Macroscopic and microscopic investigations of different zones between colonies of the isolates of M. perniciosa revealed the phenome-non of the hyphal interference between different isolates.

40|$|<b>Mycogone</b> perniciosa is the fungal {{pathogen}} {{causing the}} wet bubble of white button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus). The main symptoms of disease are undifferentiated, irregular forms of mushroom tissue, cap spotting {{and development of}} amber liquid droplets on the distorted mushrooms. The {{aim of the research}} was to assess the pathogenicity of M. perniciosa isolates that were obtained from the infected sporophores. Six isolates from Polish mushroom farms as well reference strain of Hypomyces perniciosus CBS 322. 52 were used in this study. The pathogenicity of isolates was assessed on the basis of severity of disease symptoms and crop reduction in the first flush. Mushroom crop was infected with different suspensions containing of M. perniciosa aleuriospores. Significant variability was shown between tested isolates. It was stated that the pathogenicity of isolates and concentration of conidia had a significant influence on the mushroom yield. The isolate of high pathogenicity caused significant yield losses, after inoculation with 1. 3 × 104 ·m− 2, whereas the isolate with fairly pathogenicity did not produce symptoms of wet bubble disease or caused slight deformation of single sporophores, even when the casing soil was inoculated with 1. 3 × 106 ·m− 2 spores...|$|E
40|$|Outbreaks of {{wet bubble}} disease (WBD) caused by <b>Mycogone</b> perniciosa are {{increasing}} {{across the world}} and seriously affecting the yield of Agaricus bisporus. However, highly WBD-resistant strains are rare. Here, we tested 28 A. bisporus strains for WBD resistance by inoculating M. perniciosa spore suspension on casing soil, and assessed genetic diversity of these strains using 17 new simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers developed in this study. We found that 10 wild strains originating from the Tibetan Plateau in China were highly WBD-resistant strains, and 13 cultivated strains from six countries were highly susceptible strains. A total of 88 alleles were detected in these 28 strains, and the observed number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 8. Cluster and genetic structure analysis results revealed the wild resources from China have a relatively high level of genetic diversity and occur at low level of gene flow and introgression with cultivated strains. Moreover, the wild strains from China potentially have the consensus ancestral genotypes different from the cultivated strains and evolved independently.

40|$|The most {{commonly}} cultivated basidiomycetes worldwide and in Serbia are button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus), oyster mushroom (Pleurotus sp.) and shiitake (Lentinus edodes). Production of their fruiting bodies is severely afflicted by fungal, bacterial, and viral pathogens that {{are able to}} cause diseases which affect yield and quality. Major A. bisporus fungal pathogens include <b>Mycogone</b> perniciosa, Lecanicillium fungicola, and Cladobotryum spp., the causal agents of dry bubble, wet bubble, and cobweb disease, respectively. Various Trichoderma species, the causal agents of green mould, also affect all three kinds of edible mushrooms. Over the past two decades, green mould caused by T. aggressivum has been the most serious disease of button mushroom. Oyster mushroom is susceptible to T. pleurotum and shiitake to T. harzianum. The bacterial brawn blotch disease, caused by Pseudomonas tolaasii, is distributed globally. Disease control on mushroom farms worldwide is commonly based on the use of fungicides. However, evolution of pathogen resistance to fungicides after frequent application, and host sensitivity to fungicides are serious problems. Only a few fungicides are officially recommended in mushroom production: chlorothalonil and thiabendazol in North America and prochloraz in the EU and some other countries. Even though decreased sensitivity levels of L. fungicola and Cladobotryum mycophilum to prochloraz have been detected, disease control is still mainly provided by that chemical fungicide. Considering such resistance evolution, harmful impact to the environment and human health, special attention should be focused on biofungicides, both microbiological products based on Bacillus species and various natural substances of biological origin, together with good programs of hygiene. Introduction of biofungicides has created new possibilities for crop protection with reduced application of chemicals...|$|E
40|$|Peat is a {{suitable}} casing layer {{most commonly used}} as a substrate in commercial production of white button mushrooms. However, further exploitation of this substrate in South Africa is restricted due the environmental status of this scarce and protected natural resource. Therefore, finding an easily available and economically viable casing material that can either partially or completely replace peat is important for sustainable mushroom production. In the process of finding a replacement material, information regarding the microbiological properties of peat and alternative casing materials is required to profile a natural stable ecosystem since the presence of bacteria in the casing layer is important for pinning and fruit body formation. Pseudomonad bacteria in the casing layer are known {{to play a role}} in the fructification of mushroom mycelium. The aim of this study was to investigate the microbial dynamics and profiles of peat, industrial by-products and peat-based mixtures with byproducts using cultural and a culture-independent molecular technique such as denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Other aims of this study were to investigate the overall microbial profiles of compost, casing and mushrooms in a commercial mushroom production cycle and to evaluate effects of isolated micro-organisms on mycelial growth, mushroom yield and in vitro disease control. Total bacterial population densities in peat-based mixtures at pinning were comparable to that of peat alone and pseudomonads constituted part of bacterial populations in these mixtures. Other bacteria in peat and the mixtures included Ensifer spp., Sinorhizobium spp., Bacillus spp., Sporosarcina spp., Microbacterium spp. Arthrobacter spp. and Sphingobacterium spp. Bacterial profiles of peat at pinning also showed dominant bacteria other than pseudomonads including Bacteroidetes, alpha-Proteobacterium, beta-Proteobacterium, gamma-Proteobacterium, delta-Proteobacterium and uncultured species. In viewing the overall microbial profile of compost, casing and harvested mushrooms, bacterial profiles of mushrooms were more similar to those of casing than to compost and were dominated by pseudomonads. Fungal profiles of compost, casing at pinning and freshly harvested and stored mushrooms were completely dominated by Agaricus bisporus. Bacterial and yeast populations increased significantly during mushroom storage at 4 oC while fungal populations remained low. Pseudomonas spp. and an Arthrobactor sp. isolated from casing resulted in 100 % in vitro growth stimulation of A. bisporus. Several bacteria and yeasts isolated from compost, casing and mushrooms inhibited in vitro growth of the fungal mushroom pathogens Verticillium fungicola var aleophilum, V. psalliotae, <b>Mycogone</b> perniciosa, Cladobotryum dendroides, C. mycophilum, Trichoderma aggressivum f. europaeum, T. aggressivum f. aggressivum and T. harizianum. In conclusion, peat-based casing mixtures with industrial by-products harbour bacteria important in A. bisporus fructification. Bacteria in these casings are also important in other aspects of mushroom production such as growth stimulation. Based on results in this study, mushroom bacterial profiles are similar to those of the casing, suggesting postharvest quality may be controlled by manipulating casing bacteria.

40|$|Agaricus bisporus (Lange) Imbach – button {{mushrooms}} is {{a commonly}} cultivated mushroom throughout Europe which has very significant agricultural production. Mushroom cultivation is a monoculture which {{is exposed to}} different pathogens and pests. The most economically significant mushroom pathogens is Lecanicillium fungicola, the causative agent of Dry Bubble disease. This mycoparasite is responsible for severe losses of cultivated mushrooms and can terminate all mushroom production. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate sources of dry bubble disease on mushroom farms using microbiological and molecular approaches. The main focus of the research was to develop a selective medium, to modify the existing selective method and molecular method – Real Time PCR for detection from samples originating from mushroom farms. The first task of this research was evaluate DNA extractions methods from pure cultures of L. fungicola and optimise PCR conditions using a know sets of primers. All tested DNA extraction method gave good genomic DNA useful for PCR. The next part of this research was identify and detect of L. fungicola in samples originating from mushroom farms. A PCR assay was developed and optimised for the detection of L. fungicola in casing soil and other mushroom farm debris. Four different methods were evaluated for the isolation of DNA from soil containing different concentrations of conidia of L. fungicola including manual extraction and commercially available kits. Only two methods succeeded extracted L. fungicola DNA from samples containing soil and casing. The primers for detection of L. fungicola designed by Zijlstra et al. (2007, 2008 and 2009) gave a 102 bp amplification product and this primer set was tested in PCR reactions for A. bisporus and other mushroom pathogens such as Cladobotryum mycophilum, <b>Mycogone</b> perniciosa and Trichoderma sp. and also Aspergillus fumigatus. On this research also was designed a selective primers for Lecanicillium fungicola detection from mushroom farms using ITS and MAT 1 - 2 - 1 region. It was not possible to find truly specific primers for this purpose but some of the sets of primers generated can be used for in-vitro test for detection and identification L. fungicola from A. bisporus tissues. This study also succeeded in designing selective media for detection of L. fungicola from mushroom farm samples. Lecanicilium fungicola selective medium already exists (Rinker et al., 1993), but the growth of L. fungicola is very slow due to the inhibitive nature of the ingredients on fungal growth. A modified selective medium and novel selective medium were developed to enable rapid and consistent detection of L. fungicola from contaminated soil and casing samples after 6 days of incubation. Mushroom farms visits were performed for detection of L. fungicola from different locations and stages of the crop cycle from spawn running to 3 rd flush. Lecanicillium fungicola was detected by microbiological tests using novel and modified selective media and molecular method Real Time PCR – TaqMan test using the above mentioned primers...|$|E
