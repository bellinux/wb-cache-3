Totally twenty mixed oil samples were prepared with different ratios of light to crude oil from different oil wells but the same oil field.

Results showed that the mixing process affected the weathering rate of some compounds in the oils and also that certain diagnostic ratios are more suitable for estimating mixing proportions.

40|$|Olive oil {{provides}} {{a mixture of}} lipids and antioxidant nutrients which may help preventing age-related diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, {{little is known about}} the associations between olive oil consumption and the risk of AMD. To examine associations between olive oil use and AMD prevalence in elderly subjects. Alienor (Antioxydants, Lipides Essentiels, Nutrition et maladies OculaiRes) is a population-based study on eye diseases performed in elderly residents of Bordeaux (France). In 1999 - 2000, frequencies of consumption of main categories of dietary fats used were collected. In 2006 - 2088, AMD was graded from non mydriatic retinal photographs into three exclusive stages: no AMD, early AMD, and late AMD. Two categories of preferred dietary fat used (olive oil, n- 3 rich oils, n- 6 rich oils, <b>mixed</b> <b>oils,</b> butter and margarine) were defined: "no use" and "regular use" (using fat for spreading and/or cooking and/or dressing). Associations of AMD with each fat use were estimated using Generalized Estimating Equation logistic regressions models. Our study included 654 subjects (1269 eyes) with complete data (n = 268 eyes with early AMD and n = 56 with late AMD). After adjustment for potential confounders, regular use of olive oil was significantly associated with a decreased risk of late AMD (odds ratio [OR] = 0. 44, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 21; 0. 91). In contrast, regular use of olive oil was not significantly associated with early AMD (OR = 0. 84, 95 %CI: 0. 59; 1. 21). No associations were found between regular consumption of n- 3 rich oils, n- 6 rich oils, <b>mixed</b> <b>oils,</b> butter and margarine and AMD, whatever the stage. This study suggests a protective effect of olive oil consumption for late AMD in this elderly community-dwelling population.

30|$|The C 6 –C 12 low {{molecular}} weight hydrocarbons (LMWHs) {{are an important part}} of petroleum, consisting of different compound classes (n-, iso-, cyclo-alkanes, and aromatics). Various parameters based on the chemical and isotopic compositions of these LMWHs have been widely utilized to make oil/source correlations (Bjorøy et al. 1994; Ten Haven 1996; Odden et al. 1998; Whiticar and Snowdon 1999; Obermajer et al. 2000; Wever 2000), assess the thermal maturity of oils and condensates (Thompson 1983; Mango 2000), determine the source allocation of <b>mixed</b> <b>oils</b> (Chung et al. 1998; Rooney et al. 1998), and identify various secondary alterations of crude oils (George et al. 2002; Pasadakis et al. 2004; Zhang et al. 2005).

40|$|Background: Scientific workers play an {{important}} role in the development of science and technology. However, evidence is lacking with regard to the associations between their dietary factors and their health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 775 scientific workers from multiple universities and institutes in the Southwest region of China. A self-administered food-frequency questionnaire was used to collect the food consumption information, and the 36 -item Short-Form Health Survey was used to assess physical HRQOL. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used to identify the factors associated with scientific workers’ HRQOL. Results: Physical HRQOL was negatively associated with age and intake of fresh pork (fat) and animal viscera, whereas consumption of vegetables, fruits, refined cereals and dairy products were positively correlated with physical HRQOL. Participants with daily intake of vegetable oils or <b>mixed</b> <b>oils</b> showed higher physical HRQOL scores than those with intake of animal oils. Conclusions: Dietary habits are closely associated with the physical HRQOL of scientific workers. The dietary patterns that had more vegetables and fruits, less fresh pork (fat) and animal viscera, and used vegetable oils during cooking corresponded to higher physical HRQOL scores. These findings are important for planning dietary strategies to improve physical health in scientific workers...|$|E

The samples were produced at Tomas Bata University in Zlín. Aroma compounds were extracted using SPME and assessed using gas chromatography. In total 43 compounds were identified, 14 alcohols, 9 aldehydes, 7 ketones, 8 acids, 5 esters and 1 terpene. Simultaneously the analogues were sensorially evaluated using scale, profile and ranking tests. The influence of storage time, type of fat and Edam cheese used on content of aroma compounds and sensory quality of analogues were evaluated. The cheese analogues with butter were sensorially evaluated as the best, with mixed oil as the worst. From {{the point of view}} of aroma compounds content, the significant differences between samples were evident. Using more matured Edam cheese, the content of aroma compounds declined, however, these samples were sensorially evaluated as better. The content of aroma compounds decreased also with storage time, which is more obvious in less matured Edam cheese. So all above mentioned factors influence the content of aroma compounds and thus the flavour of cheese analogues...|$|E

40|$|Authentication of {{edible oils}} is a {{long-term}} issue in food safety, and becomes particularly important with the emergence and wide spread of gutter oils in recent years. Due to the very high analytical demand and diversity of gutter oils, a high throughput analytical method and a versatile strategy for authentication of mixed edible oils and gutter oils are highly desirable. In this study, an improved matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) method has been developed for direct analysis of edible oils. This method involved on-target sample loading, automatic data acquisition and simple data processing. MALDI-MS spectra with high quality and high reproducibility have been obtained using this method, and a preliminary spectral database of edible oils has been set up. The authenticity of an edible oil sample can be determined by comparing its MALDI-MS spectrum and principal component analysis (PCA) results with those of its labeled oil in the database. This method is simple and the whole process only takes several minutes for analysis of one oil sample. We demonstrated that the method was sensitive to change in oil compositions {{and can be used}} for measuring compositions of <b>mixed</b> <b>oils.</b> The capability of the method for determining mislabeling enables it for rapid screening of gutter oils since fraudulent mislabeling is a common feature of gutter oils.
