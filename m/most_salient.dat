5|$|Domain-general {{views of}} {{vocabulary}} development argue that {{children do not}} need principles or constraints in order to successfully develop word-world mappings. Instead, word learning can be accounted for through general learning mechanisms such as salience, association, and frequency. Children are thought to notice the objects, actions, or events that are <b>most</b> <b>salient</b> in context, and then to associate them with the words that are most frequently used in their presence. Additionally, research on word learning suggests that fast mapping, the rapid learning that children display after a single exposure to new information, is not specific to word learning. Children can also successfully fast map when exposed to a novel fact, remembering both words and facts after a time delay.|$|E
5|$|One of the <b>most</b> <b>salient</b> {{characteristics}} of the newly established Commonwealth was its multiethnicity, and accordingly diversity of religious faiths and denominations. Among the peoples represented were Poles (about 50% or less of the total population), Lithuanians, Latvians, Rus' people (corresponding to today's Belarusians, Ukrainians, Russians or their East Slavic ancestors), Germans, Estonians, Jews, Armenians, Tatars and Czechs, among others, for example smaller West European groups. As for the main social segments in the early 17th century, nearly 70% of the Commonwealth's population were peasants, over 20% residents of towns, and less than 10% nobles and clergy combined. The total population, estimated at 8–10 millions, kept growing dynamically {{until the middle of}} the century. The Slavic populations of the eastern lands, Rus' or Ruthenia, were solidly, except for the Polish colonizing nobility (and Polonized elements of local nobility), Eastern Orthodox, which portended future trouble for the Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|I. Allegro. The opening is dramatic, with a fully voiced forte C minor chord. The voice-leading of {{this passage}} {{outlines}} a chromatic ascent to A-flat – {{this will be}} the first instance of a remarkable degree of chromaticism in the sonata as a whole. The <b>most</b> <b>salient</b> feature of the first theme is the sudden modulatory digression to A-flat major, established by a rushing downward scale initiated by the final achievement of this key in the ascending voice of the minor theme. The exposition shifts from the tonic to the relative major (E-flat major), touching midway upon its parallel minor (E-flat minor), all in accordance with Classical practice. This second theme, a hymn-like E-flat major melody in four-part harmony, greatly contrasts with the first, though its melodic contour is prefigured in the sudden A-flat major departure. Both themes progress somewhat in the style of variations, and are structured with irregular phrase lengths. The development section is highly chromatic, and is texturally and melodically distinct from the exposition. The recapitulation is once again traditional, staying in the tonic and stressing subdominant tonalities (D-flat, the lowered second degree – in the first theme). The coda returns to the material of the development section, but with stable tonality, dying out in a dark series of cadences in low register.|$|E

40|$|Speech recognition, by both {{humans and}} machines, {{benefits}} from visual {{observation of the}} face, especially at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). It has often been noticed, however, that the audible and visible correlates of a phoneme may be asynchronous; perhaps for this reason, automatic speech recognition structures that allow asynchrony between the audible phoneme and the visible viseme outperform recognizers that allow no such asynchrony. This paper proposes, and tests using experimental speech recognition systems, a new explanation for audio-visual asynchrony. Specifically, we propose that audio-visual asynchrony {{may be the result}} of asynchrony between the gestures implemented by different articulators, such that the <b>most</b> visibly <b>salient</b> articulator (e. g., the lips) and the <b>most</b> audibly <b>salient</b> articulator (e. g., the glottis) may, at any given time, be dominated by gestures associated with different phonemes. The proposed model of audio-visual asynchrony is tested by implementing an “articulatory-feature model ” audiovisual speech recognizer: a system with multiple hidden state variables, each representing the gestures of one articulator. The proposed system performs as well as a standard audiovisual recognizer on a digit recognition task; the best results are achieved by combining the outputs of the two systems...|$|R

25|$|Overall, {{relatively}} few differences are reported between Asperger's and autism on parameters related to causation.

25|$|The art {{production}} continued also {{during the}} Byzantine era. The <b>most</b> <b>salient</b> {{feature of this}} new aesthetic was its “abstract,” or anti-naturalistic character. If classical art was marked by the attempt to create representations that mimicked reality as closely as possible, Byzantine art seems to have abandoned this attempt {{in favor of a}} more symbolic approach. The Byzantine painting concentrated mainly on icons and hagiographies. The Macedonian art (Byzantine) was the artistic expression of Macedonian Renaissance, a label sometimes used to describe the period of the Macedonian dynasty of the Byzantine Empire (867–1056), especially the 10th century, which some scholars have seen as a time of increased interest in classical scholarship and the assimilation of classical motifs into Christian artwork.|$|E

One of the <b>most</b> <b>salient</b> discoveries of primitive art in America was found in here, called the Tequixquiac Bone, which had no known purpose, but reflected the ideological sense of the artist who carved the piece of bone from a camelid around 22,000 years BCE.

They were engaged mainly in agriculture and the breeding of domestic animals.|$|E
25|$|McLuhan's 1942 Cambridge University {{doctoral}} dissertation surveys {{the history of}} the verbal arts (grammar, logic, and rhetoric—collectively known as the trivium) from the time of Cicero down to the time of Thomas Nashe. In his later publications, McLuhan at times uses the Latin concept of the trivium to outline an orderly and systematic picture of certain periods in the history of Western culture. McLuhan suggests that the Middle Ages, for instance, was characterized by the heavy emphasis on the formal study of logic. The key development that led to the Renaissance was not the rediscovery of ancient texts but a shift in emphasis from the formal study of logic to rhetoric and language. Modern life is characterized by the re-emergence of grammar as its <b>most</b> <b>salient</b> feature—a trend McLuhan felt was exemplified by the New Criticism of Richards and Leavis.|$|E
25|$|Use of {{ondansetron}} {{has been}} associated with prolongation of the QT interval, which can lead to the potentially fatal heart rhythm known as torsades de pointes. Although this may happen in any patient with any formulation, the risk is <b>most</b> <b>salient</b> with the injectable (intravenous) form of the drug, and increases with dose. The risk is also higher in patients taking other medicines that prolong the QT interval, as well as in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, and/or bradyarrhythmias. As such, single doses of injectable ondansetron should not exceed 16mg at one time. (Oral dosing recommendations remain intact, including the recommendation of a single 24-mg oral dose when indicated.) Electrolyte imbalances should be corrected before the use of injectable ondansetron. Patients are cautioned to seek immediate medical care if symptoms such as irregular heartbeat/palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting occur while taking ondansetron.|$|E

25|$|In the Sahel, on {{the margins}} of the Hamitic nucleus in the {{northwest}} and northeast, several populations speaking non-Hamitic languages yet possessing some Hamitic physical and cultural affinities could be found. Among these were the Fulani, who were believed to have been of Berber origin. Beginning in the late medieval period, as they assimilated into the burgeoning states of the Western Sudan, the Fulani are thought to have gradually adopted the Niger-Congo tongue of their urban neighbors. As a result, the Hamitic element was most marked among the Bororo and other pastoral Fulani groups rather than in the Fulanin Gidda settled communities. Similarly, the Toubou of the Tibesti Mountains were held to have descended from the ancient Garamantes. This Hamitic ancestry was believed to be <b>most</b> <b>salient</b> among the northern Teda Toubou, as the southern Daza Toubou often intermarried with the adjacent Nilotic populations.|$|E
25|$|Though its exact {{parameters}} remain debatable, {{from the}} early 1970s {{to the present day}} the <b>most</b> <b>salient</b> literary movement has been postmodernism. Thomas Pynchon, a seminal practitioner of the form, drew in his work on modernist fixtures such as temporal distortion, unreliable narrators, and internal monologue and coupled them with distinctly postmodern techniques such as metafiction, ideogrammatic characterization, unrealistic names (Oedipa Maas, Benny Profane, etc.), absurdist plot elements and hyperbolic humor, deliberate use of anachronisms and archaisms, a strong focus on postcolonial themes, and a subversive commingling of high and low culture. In 1973, he published Gravity's Rainbow, a leading work in this genre, which won the National Book Award and was unanimously nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction that year. His other major works include his debut, V. (1963), The Crying of Lot 49 (1966), Mason & Dixon (1997), and Against the Day (2006).|$|E
25|$|Involuntary autobiographical memory (IAM) {{retrieval}} occurs spontaneously as {{the result}} of sensory cues as well as internal cues, such as thought or intention. These cues influence us in our day-to-day lives by constantly and automatically activating unconscious memories through priming. It has been demonstrated in many studies that our specific goals and intentions will most frequently result in the retrieval of related IAM, while the second most frequent IAM retrievals result from physical cues in the surrounding context. Autobiographical memories that are unrelated to any specific cues, whether internal or external, are the least frequent to occur. It has been suggested that in this case, an error in self-regulation of memory has occurred that results in an unrelated autobiographical memory reaching the conscious mind. These findings are consistent with metacognition as the third type of experience is often identified as the <b>most</b> <b>salient</b> one.|$|E
