2500|$|In 1959 Colby {{became the}} CIA's deputy chief and then chief of station in Saigon, South Vietnam, {{where he served}} until 1962. Tasked by CIA with {{supporting}} the government of Ngo Dinh Diem, Colby established a relationship with President Diem's family and with Ngo Ngô Đình Nhu, the president's brother, with whom Colby became close. While in Vietnam, Colby focused intensively on building up Vietnamese capabilities to combat the Viet Cong insurgency in the countryside. He argued that [...] "the key {{to the war in}} Vietnam was the war in the villages." [...] In 1962 he returned to Washington to become the deputy and then chief of CIA's Far East Division, succeeding Desmond Fitzgerald, who had been tapped to lead the Agency's efforts against Castro's Cuba. During these years Colby was deeply involved in Washington's policies in East Asia, particularly with respect to Vietnam, as well as Indonesia, Japan, Korea, and China. He was deeply critical of the decision to abandon support for Diem, and he believed this played a <b>material</b> <b>part</b> in the weakening of the South Vietnamese position in the years following.|$|E

He {{returned}} to the Leicestershire team in 1905 when John King was injured and in his second game he took 10 Essex wickets for 134 runs in an innings victory, including seven for 84 in the second innings. He retained his place when King returned and in 22 matches in 1905 took 102 wickets {{at an average of}} 23.79, a <b>material</b> <b>part</b> of Leicestershire's most successful season since they achieved first-class status in 1895. Against Derbyshire he took nine wickets for 78 runs in the Derbyshire second innings: five clean bowled, two lbw, two caught and bowled and he caught the tenth batsman off the bowling of Sam Coe. In the same match, he made his highest score of the season with the bat, with 74; his batting was slower to develop, but he scored 525 runs in 1905 at an average of 21.00 and he also took 29 catches. Towards the end of the season, he was picked for [...] "An Eleven of England" [...] to play the Australian touring team under the captaincy of the 57-year-old W. G. Grace; under Grace's individual captaincy, he bowled only three overs, took no wickets and made just 10 runs in two innings.|$|E

A knowledge of the difficulties to be overcome in the <b>material</b> <b>part</b> of painting is undoubtedly an unsuspected element of much of the pleasure we derive from it; and for this reason, probably, this tapestry appeared to us better than paintings executed with equal spirit in oils.

This paper proposes a virtual assembly and repair analysis method based on both geometric design model and object scanning model. By matching the scanned cloud point model to the design model, the virtual assembly process is constructed, and the repair analysis is implemented according to the results of virtual assembly. The proposed method is investigated by truss structure, and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|R

As he affected a pedantic way of pronouncing the last syllable long, or as it was spelt, he rather called himself Noo-comb, instead of Newcome, as is the English mode, whence he soon got the nick-name of Jason Old Comb among the boys; the lank, orderly arrangement of his jet-black, and somewhat greasy-looking locks, contributing their share towards procuring for him the sobriquet, as I believe the French call it. As this Mr. Newcome will have a <b>material</b> <b>part</b> {{to play in the}} succeeding portions of this narrative, it may be well {{to be a little more}} minute in his description.|$|E

How did the two sets of objects come to be all mixed up together, in an old hill fort, at Dunbuie on Clyde; and among the wooden foundations of two mysterious structures, excavated in the mud of the Clyde estuary at Dumbuck and Langbank, near Dumbarton? They were dug up between 1896 and 1902.|$|E
