5000|$|Yamato Agari is a 21st-century reincarnation of a bandit {{from the}} Heian period. As in the past, Yamato meets the [...] "Karakuri Dôji", <b>mechanical</b> <b>boys,</b> that {{transform}} his otherwise normal {{life into a}} battle of good versus evil. Immediately after Yamato meets the dôji Ultimo, another one called Vice appears, and he barely escapes from their fight. Now acquainted with Ultimo, Yamato is confronted by many other dôji, both evil and good.|$|R
5000|$|Ultimo and Vice {{were created}} in feudal Japan to be [...] "perfect good" [...] and [...] "perfect evil" [...] as Dr. Dunstan's [...] "last curse upon this world." [...] A {{thousand}} years later, a monster wearing a Noh mask wreaks havoc in Farmless City of West Tokyo, while the S.K.A.T. Police unit cannot stop it. Ultimo plunges in to destroy the monster, explaining that the creature is about to show its true form, Vice, Ultimo's evil counterpart. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>boys</b> end their fight both badly damaged, {{and the movement of}} select groups around Japan begins.|$|R
5000|$|...Circus Fantasy: Fantasy Under the Big Top. Mutilated warrior women, dead <b>boys,</b> <b>mechanical</b> dogs, {{and escape}} artists {{are just some}} of the wonders and horrors {{explored}} in this bizarre assembly of works from voices new and old.|$|R
50|$|The other nominees were Tino Sehgal for {{performance}} {{works at the}} Turbine Hall at Tate Modern and dOCUMENTA (13) in Kassel; David Shrigley for a retrospective at the Hayward Gallery, in Ireland he showed a <b>mechanical</b> <b>boy</b> shown as a life art which visitors were encouraged to draw; and Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, for portrait paintings of imaginary subjects at her first solo exhibition at Chisenhale Gallery.|$|E
50|$|Some {{consider}} these devices {{to be the}} oldest examples of the computer. The Writer, a <b>mechanical</b> <b>boy</b> who writes with a quill pen upon paper with real ink, has an input device to set tabs, defining individual letters written by the boy, that form a programmable memory. 40 cams that represent the read-only programme. The work of Pierre Jaquet-Droz predates that of Charles Babbage by decades.|$|E
50|$|The Kin-der-Kids {{featured}} {{an ongoing}} {{story about the}} three Kin-der brothers who, along with their dog and a <b>mechanical</b> <b>boy,</b> sailed in the family's antique bathtub to explore the world. The story implies that the Kin-ders sailed for a specific reason: early on they receive a note - unseen to the reader - from Mysterious Pete which contains instructions for their journey. These instructions {{and the purpose of}} their journey remain indeterminate {{for the life of the}} comic.|$|E
6000|$|However, for the present, Maximilian was keen {{enough to}} see that the <b>boy's</b> <b>mechanical</b> skill was not as yet equal to his genius; so he only {{encouraged}} him to practise, adding that he heard there was a rare lad, one Durer, at Nuremburg, whose productions were already wonderful. [...] "And what is this?" [...] he asked; [...] "what is the daintily- carved group I see yonder?" ...|$|R
50|$|It was {{everyday}} life, {{watched and}} caught on London streets, and human being (she neither understood or liked abstraction) {{that became the}} subject of her works from the beginning. She was painting the world that was surrounding her as well as people: women at a <b>mechanical</b> laundry, a <b>boy</b> with a chunk of meat, mannequins in a shop window, coalmen, men and women on escalator and in a coffee shop.|$|R
60|$|Some of his friends, no doubt, advised Isaac's {{grandmother}} to apprentice {{him to a}} clock-maker; for, besides his <b>mechanical</b> skill, the <b>boy</b> {{seemed to have a}} taste for mathematics, which would be very useful to him in that profession. And then, in due time, Isaac would set up for himself, and would manufacture curious clocks, like those that contain sets of dancing figures, which issue from the dial-plate when the hour is struck; or like those where a ship sails across the face of the clock, and is seen tossing {{up and down on the}} waves as often as the pendulum vibrates.|$|R
50|$|Monotrona’s early {{performances}} (1996-1997) utilized {{drums and}} metal percussion, played while standing up, along with electronics, which Jodie built herself {{and played with}} her feet. These early performances include Gorditz, Ooka, and Jing Pow Ki Poo. Some of the homemade electronics in these performances include a sine-wave generator, square-wave generator, baby monitors, heart monitors, PZM microphones attached to drums, toy drum machines, and a Wollensak reel-to-reel tape recorder. As Joey the <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Boy,</b> Monotrona used a Casio keyboard and modified children’s toys attached to her arms.|$|E
5000|$|As with popping in general, {{the visual}} {{impact of the}} robot can be boosted by doing it in pace with music. The best effect is {{achieved}} with music that has very distinct beats such as electrofunk. It is nonetheless common to use music not particularly suited for the dance, but which has a [...] "robot theme", In 1969 Jack Wild in the <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Boy</b> episode of H.R. Puffnstuff, or The Jackson 5's [...] "Dancing Machine" [...] Robot done by Michael Jackson. The Jackson 5 first performed Dancing Machine on Soul Train in later October 1973 where Michael Jackson performed a robot dance during the song's musical break. The group again performed the routine on The Mike Douglas Show and the Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour in 1974.|$|E

He served {{briefly as}} editor of the Houston Voice before {{beginning}} as the Houston Music Critic for the Houston Chronicle in May, 2006. At the Houston Chronicle, he mans the Handstamp Blog (along with Sara Cress) and writes a popular American Idol blog for the site's Tubular blog.

5000|$|Others took a {{more serious}} {{viewpoint}} of Monotrona. Tom Moody, for example, describes her as a [...] "post-feminist, posthuman musician/performance artist" [...] and indeed {{a closer look at}} the lyrics reveals a recurring tension between that which is human and that which is not. Joey the <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Boy,</b> for example, concerns a boy who thinks he is controlled by a dark machine force: [...] "The dark force is on his way / He will take you to his place / That’s the place where all machines live / There are no people there / No bodies that easily break / No emotions to fake / It's time you all cleared the room / Because the machine is more powerful than you." [...] And indeed, when the performances are taken as a whole, Monotrona's work seems to be less about fright and fun then about exploring the various limits of humanness. One of her last incarnations, Burglemir, laments: [...] "I’d like a coat and one pair of shoes / To touch the earth as only a man can do / Look at this world: it’s so damn small / My foot's a mountain and I'd like to squash it all / But I can't squash a thing because I'm not a man not a human being / Brutality’s for men, not for Superbeings." ...|$|E
