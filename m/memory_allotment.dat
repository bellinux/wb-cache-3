50|$|Google's RE2 has a {{slightly}} smaller set of features than PCRE, but has very predictable run-time and a maximum <b>memory</b> <b>allotment,</b> making it suitable for use in server applications which require precise boundaries on memory usage and computational time. PCRE, on the other hand, has {{almost all of the}} features that a regular expression library can have, but has unpredictable run-time and memory usage and can grow unbounded.|$|E
5000|$|The {{data link}} layer {{addresses}} data packets based on the destination hardware’s physical Media Access Control (MAC) address. Switches within the network maintain Content Address Tables (CAMs) that maps the switch’s ports to specific MAC addresses. These tables allow the switch to securely deliver the packet to its intended physical address only. Using the switch to connect only the systems that are communicating provides much greater security than a network hub, which broadcasts all traffic over all ports, allowing an eavesdropper to intercept and monitor all network traffic. A CAM Table Exhaustion Attack basically turns a switch into a hub. [...] The attacker floods the CAM table with new MAC-to-port mappings until the table’s fixed <b>memory</b> <b>allotment</b> is full. At this point the switch no longer knows how to deliver traffic based on a MAC-to-port mapping, and defaults to broadcasting traffic over all ports. An adversary is then able to intercept and monitor all network traffic traversing the switch to include passwords, emails, instant messages, etc.|$|E
40|$|Modern Avionics are {{controlled}} by sophisticated mission components in the Aircraft. The control function is implemented via a standard ARINC- 429 bus interface. It is a two-wire point-topoint serial data bus for control communications in Avionics. The bus operates 12. 5 or 100 kb/sec, the implementation is envisaged for one transmits and receive channel respectively. Further the code can be modified for more no of independent Tx and Rx channels. An on chip <b>memory</b> <b>allotment</b> on the FPGA will provide a buffer bank for storing the incoming or outgoing data. For this purpose SRAM based FPGAs are utilized. This flexible ARINC 429 solution gives exactly what is needed for real time applications. The IP can be programmed to send an interrupt to the host and also prepare it to process the data. Majority of the hardware function of digital natures are embedded into a single FPGA by saving in terms of PCB board space, power consumption and volume results. This paper deals with the development, implementation, simulation, and verification of ARINC_ 429 formats. The IP core development is described in VHDL. Comment: 7 pages, 15 figure...|$|E
5000|$|Soon {{after the}} initial release of System 7, the 7.0.1 minor update was {{released}} in October 1991. A patch called [...] "System 7 Tune-Up" [...] also followed, which fixed the [...] "disappearing files" [...] bug in which the system would lose files and added [...] "minimum" [...] and [...] "preferred" [...] <b>memory</b> <b>allotments</b> to an application's Get Info box. In August 1992, the 7.1 update was released which incorporated these changes and introduced the Fonts folder. This replaced the often time-consuming method of dragging fonts {{to and from the}} System file, introduced in System 7.0; it also replaced the Font/DA Mover application from System 6, which could also be used with 7.0.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} {{an efficient}} framework for producing high and early result throughput in multi-join query plans. While most previous {{research focuses on}} optimizing for cases involving a single join operator, this work takes a radical step by addressing query plans with multiple join operators. The proposed framework consists of two main methods, a flush algorithm and operator state manager. The framework assumes a symmetric hash join, a common method for producing early results, when processing incoming data. In this way, our methods {{can be applied to}} a group of previous join operators (optimized for single-join queries) when taking part in multi-join query plans. Specifically, our framework can be applied by (1) employing a new flushing policy to write in-memory data to disk, once <b>memory</b> <b>allotment</b> is exhausted, in a way that helps increase the probability of producing early result throughput in multi-join queries, and (2) employing a state manager that adaptively switches operators in the plan between joining in-memory data and disk-resident data in order to positively affect the early result throughput. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art join operators optimized for both single and multi-join query plans...|$|E
