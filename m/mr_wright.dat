25|$|While he {{was still}} a {{professional}} footballer at Arsenal, Wright published his autobiography, <b>Mr</b> <b>Wright.</b> It was first published in hardback in 1996 by Collins Willow when Wright was still a professional player at Arsenal.|$|E
500|$|Though a few voices {{expressed}} skepticism of the report's conclusions—notably Frank Stoneman, {{the editor}} of the Miami News-Record (the forerunner of The Miami Herald)—the report was hailed as impeccable, coming from a branch of the U.S. government. In 1912 Florida appointed Wright to oversee the drainage, and the real estate industry energetically misrepresented this mid-level engineer as the world's foremost authority on wetlands drainage, in charge of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. However, the U.S. House of Representatives investigated Wright since no report had officially been published despite the money paid for it. Wright eventually retired when it was discovered that his colleagues disagreed with his conclusions and refused to approve the report's publication. One testified at the hearings: [...] "I regard <b>Mr.</b> <b>Wright</b> as absolutely and completely incompetent for any engineering work".|$|E
500|$|Lee Ruth Davis, her sister, and two {{brothers}} were {{hidden by the}} Wrights while their father hid in the woods. On the morning of Poly Wilkerson's funeral, the Wrights left the children alone to attend. Davis and her siblings crept {{out of the house}} to hide with relatives in the nearby town of Wylly, but they were turned back for being too dangerous. The children spent the day in the woods but decided to return to the Wrights' house. After spotting men with guns on their way back, they crept back to the Wrights, who were frantic with fear. Davis later described the experience: [...] "I was laying that deep in water, that is where we sat all day long... We got on our bellies and crawled. We tried to keep people from seeing us through the bushes... We were trying to get back to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Wright</b> house. After we got all the way to his house, Mr. and Mrs. Wright were all the way out in the bushes hollering and calling us, and when we answered, they were so glad." [...] Several other white residents of Sumner hid black residents of Rosewood and smuggled them out of town. Gainesville's black community took in many of Rosewood's evacuees, waiting for them at the train station and greeting survivors as they disembarked, covered in sheets. On Sunday, January 7, a mob of 100 to 150 whites returned to burn the remaining dozen or so structures of Rosewood.|$|E
50|$|Wright {{became a}} friend and {{financial}} adviser to Sir James Reid, the personal physician to Queen Victoria. In fact Reid became the trustee for <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Wright</b> in the financier's will; later this would lead to financial difficulties for the physician for neglecting her interests in the events connected to Wright's fall. Reid eventually had to pay <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Wright</b> £5,000.|$|R

2500|$|When Kidd and {{his crew}} began the {{inspection}} of Quedagh Merchant, while inventorying the loot, the Frenchman mentioned {{that he was not}} actually the captain of the vessel, but that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Wright</b> was indeed the man in that role. [...] Kidd located Captain Wright below deck, and he denied being the captain, although the French pass identified him as the captain with the inscription [...] "pilot Rette". [...] Wright also informed him that an agent for the English East India Company had brokered the voyage, Kidd, acknowledging that looting this ship could raise concerns back in England, decided that the crew vote on whether to take the ship and its cargo, or sell it back to the Armenians. [...] A man named Cogi Baba offered to buy the ship and its cargo back for what amounted to 1/20th of the actual value of the cargo, but the men of Kidd's crew rejected the offer. [...] Kidd did not fight the vote, knowing that this was a legal capture.|$|E
2500|$|Cricket {{began to}} be played in an {{organised}} fashion in New South Wales in the 1830s. On January 2, 1863 a meeting of twenty five persons was held in Mr. W. Lee's long room to establish the 'Queanbeyan Cricket Club', [...] "to pay yearly in advance, {{in order to prevent}} the breaking down, such [...] as other clubs had, by the trouble of collecting monthly subscriptions." [...] <b>Mr.</b> <b>Wright</b> was elected to the office of president; Mr. WV. Scrivenor, treasurer; Mr. DeLissa, secretary; and Messrs. Morton, Kinseln, Davis [...] and Doyle to be members of the committee. In the 1850s a more informally structured 'Queanbeyan Club' or 'Queanbeyan District Club' had played cricket against teams from Braidwood, Gininderra, Goulburn (the 4th such match being played in 1859) and Yass. Occasional games were also played in the 1850s between the married and single members of the Queanbeyan club. Queanbeyan's first police magistrate Captain AT Faunce died while playing cricket for the Queanbeyan club on 26 April 1856, having been instrumental in introducing cricket to the region (he and his brother having played for a Military team in Sydney in the 1830s including against the Australian Cricket Club at Hyde Park in 1833 and the Racecourse in 1834, as well as against an Australian civilian XI in 1834). His son, the Rev. Canon AD Faunce of the Goulburn Diocese and St Clement's Church at Yass also played for the Queanbeyan Club in the 1850s and 1860s.|$|E

6000|$|... "I fancy <b>Mr.</b> <b>Wright</b> has bribed him {{to forget}} where his {{property}} was.

60|$|As he {{said this}} he looked very hard and {{significantly}} at the younger <b>Mr.</b> <b>Wright.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{looked up}} and met <b>Mr.</b> <b>Wright's</b> eye; the latter, too {{affected}} to speak, took out the money and passed it over.|$|R
