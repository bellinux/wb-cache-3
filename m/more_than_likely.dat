50|$|The {{dependency}} constraint {{creates a}} structure (syntax) in which any {{word of the}} appropriate class can be an argument for a given operator. The likelihood constraint places additional restrictions on this structure by making some operator/argument combinations <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> others. Thus, John wears hats is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> John wears snow {{which in turn is}} <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> John wears vacation.

The precise allotment of lands is unknown; even though the division of lands amongst later generations of meic Somairle can be readily discerned, such boundaries are unlikely to have existed during the chaotic twelfth century. It {{is possible that the}} territory of the first generation of meic Somairle may have stretched from Glenelg in the north, to the Mull of Kintyre in the south; with Áengus ruling in the north, Dubgall centred in Lorne (with possibly the bulk of the inheritance), and Ragnall in Kintyre and the southern islands.|$|E
5|$|Johnson wrote a {{considerable}} part of Irene in 1737 while teaching at Edial Hall School, the academy he had founded in 1735. Johnson spent his evenings {{working on his}} play while ignoring his wife Elizabeth (known as Tetty). This provoked David Garrick, his student, to perform a skit mocking the incidents, although the incidents he portrayed were <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>likely</b> his own fabrications. However, the play was written mostly for Mrs. Johnson; she was fond of it and {{hoped it would be}} a success. Her belief in the play inspired Johnson to finish it and push to have it performed. When Edial Hall failed, Johnson travelled to London and brought the unfinished manuscript with him. In 1737, Johnson tried to submit Irene to Charles Fleetwood, the owner-manager of the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, but Fleetwood rejected it on the grounds that there was no patron and his theatre was catering to other types of performances. Johnson tried in 1741 to have the unperformed play printed, but this too failed. He seems to have continued to revise it over the next several years, since a manuscript notebook contains draft material made not earlier than June 1746.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{explores the}} {{disconnect}} of Federal Reserve data from index number theory. A consequence {{could have been}} the decreased systemic-risk misperceptions that contributed to excess risk taking prior to the housing bust. We find that most recessions in the past 50 years were preceded by more contractionary monetary policy than indicated by simple-sum monetary data. Divisia monetary aggregate growth rates were generally lower than simple-sum aggregate growth rates in the period preceding the Great Moderation, and higher since the mid 1980 s. Monetary policy was <b>more</b> contractionary <b>than</b> <b>likely</b> intended before the 2001 recession and <b>more</b> expansionary <b>than</b> <b>likely</b> intended during the subsequent recovery...|$|R

25|$|CBS' {{first year}} of Major League Baseball postseason {{coverage}} in general, proved to be problematic for the network. First and foremost, none of the teams involved in the ALCS (Boston and Oakland), NLCS (Cincinnati and Pittsburgh), and World Series (Cincinnati and Oakland) involved teams from baseball's largest media markets. This <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>likely,</b> helped reduce playoff ratings by 9.4% for prime time games and 3.4% for weekend daytime games.

25|$|Aminopeptidase N has {{the same}} ability to {{interact}} with plant lectins C-type mannose-binding and {{also serves as a}} receptor for a retrovirus. Angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE, aminopetidase A and aminopeptidase N have cascading actions in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which suggests a common phylogenetic origin between these molecules. Some advanced studies have shown a high homology between the Aminopeptidase N and the Angiotensin-converting enzyme. It is <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>likely</b> that the unknown FCoV serotype I receptor {{is also a member of}} this receptor family and acts with mannose binding lectins.|$|E

Archaeologists have also dated the ceramics and found that the most expertly made pieces were done in the 14th century. These earlier pieces also show more influences from outside thematic sources, specifically early Walls Phase and late Braden style shell engravings from the Central Mississippi Valley. As the 15th century progressed, less competency is shown by the potters, which may indicate that less importance was attached to this particular artform.|$|E

It is confused about his life around the age of ten whether his mother had died and Clovis married Mary Randall, or if Lowe was sent away to another farm during which time his mother died and his father remarried. He apparently did work for another farm owned by the Plaisted’s, but whether or not he lived there is uncertain. Clovis and Mary had seven more children, but there is a timeline confusion that may indicate she already had children when she married Clovis.|$|E

Between the showers, Lancashire had Somerset at 48 for 2 on the first day, but the little play that was possible after that gave Mike Burns (87) and Sanath Jayasuriya (72 not out after three days) opportunity to increase the score to 195 for 3 on day 3. A draw looked <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>likely,</b> even if the sides would agree to forfeiting an innings. The fourth day was {{a full day of}} cricket, and Muttiah Muralitharan took five for 56 for Lancashire as they bowled Somerset out for 294. Iain Sutcliffe then lifted Lancashire to four batting points and 351 for 3 declared with his 150, well helped by an unbeaten century from Australian Brad Hodge.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of grants of representation, each one designed to cover a particular circumstance. The most common cover the two most common situations—either the deceased died leaving a valid will or they did not. If someone left a valid will, it is <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>likely</b> that the grant is a grant of probate. If there was no will, the grant required {{is likely to be a}} grant of administration. There are many other grants that can be required in certain circumstances, and many have technical Latin names, but the general public is most likely to encounter grants of probate or administration. If an estate has a value of less than £5,000.00 or if all assets are held jointly and therefore pass by survivorship, for example to a surviving spouse, a grant is not usually required.|$|E
25|$|Lady Isle was at {{one time}} {{connected}} with an ancient ecclesiastical establishment near Adamton, called Lady Kirk, and situated about four miles north of Ayr. As stated, a chapel was built, here dedicated to the Virgin Mary and endowed by John Blair in 1446 with the common land of Adamton. John Adair's map indicates a religious building as being located in {{the centre of the}} island and Pont also indicates a structure of some sort, well before any beacons were built. John Adair uses the name Mary Isle for the island, suggesting that this pre-reformation (c.1560s) 'chapel', like so many others, was dedicated to Saint Mary. It is <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>likely</b> that the beacons were built using stones from this chapel or 'cell' and no signs now remain of this ecclesiastical structure.

40|$|What {{characteristics}} distinguish liars from truth-tellers? Recent {{research has}} explored "when" and "why" people lie. Yet {{little is known}} about "who" lies. Previous studies have led to mixed results about the effect of gender on deception, and they have largely neglected the role of other characteristics, such as age and level of education. To shed light on these questions, here I report a meta-analysis of 6, 508 distinct observations, collected in 50 Deception Game treatments, by 6 research groups. I find that: (i) males are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> females to tell black lies; (ii) males are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> females to tell altruistic white lies; (iii) males are (marginally) <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> females to tell Pareto white lies; (iv) age has no effect on the decision to tell black lies; (v) age has no effect on the decision to tell altruistic white lies; (vi) age has no effect on the decision to tell Pareto white lies; (vii) educated subjects are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> non-educated subjects to tell black lies; (viii) the level of education has no effect on the decision to tell altruistic white lies; (ix) educated subjects are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> non-educated subjects to tell Pareto white lies.
