5|$|During this time, St. Anthony, on {{the east}} side, was {{separate}} from Minneapolis, on the west side. As a result of inferior management of the water power, St. Anthony found its manufacturing district declining. Some people and organizations started to talk about merging the two cities. A citizens' committee recommended merging the two cities in 1866, but a vote on this issue was rejected in 1867. Minneapolis incorporated as a city in 1867. The two cities found themselves competing with St. Paul, which had a larger population, the head of navigation of the Mississippi River, and <b>more</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> railroads.|$|E
5|$|As in all Norwegian {{national}} parks, motorized {{land transport}} is banned. However, on Svalbard {{this does not}} include snowmobiles. On the other hand, cycling is banned. The Governor can, however, enforce temporary bans on snowmobiles or even all travel within the national park. Use of helicopters and aircraft for sight-seeing are also prohibited. Polar bears are protected, but anyone outside of settlements is required to carry a rifle to kill polar bears in self-defense, as a last resort, should they attack. Most flora and fauna are protected; the right to gather established with the freedom to roam does not apply in national parks, although there are some exceptions. Hunting is permitted after explicit permit from the Governor, and locals have <b>more</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> hunting rights than tourists. Fishing is not permitted, although dispensations can be given.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{provided}} {{about two-thirds}} of all the ordnance used by the Allies in terms of warships, transports, warplanes, artillery, tanks, trucks, and ammunition. Though the Allies' economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of Germany and Japan, they became the decisive factor by 1942, after the United States and Soviet Union joined the Allies, as the war largely settled into one of attrition. While the Allies' ability to out-produce the Axis is often attributed to the Allies having <b>more</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> natural resources, other factors, such as Germany and Japan's reluctance to employ women in the labour force, Allied strategic bombing, and Germany's late shift to a war economy contributed significantly. Additionally, neither Germany nor Japan planned to fight a protracted war, and were not equipped to do so. To improve their production, Germany and Japan used millions of slave labourers; Germany used about 12 million people, mostly from Eastern Europe, while Japan used more than 18 million people in Far East Asia.|$|E

5|$|When the 1864 {{treaty was}} signed, the Klamath Tribes, with much less land, became short on the stream water needed for fishing. Although from the 1950s to the 1970s {{they were not}} federally recognized, the tribes never lost their water rights, and in 2001, when Klamath Basin farmers twice sued the U.S. Department of the Interior for <b>more</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> {{irrigation}} water, their rights were upheld. The tribes' water allotments for fishing {{continue to be a}} large factor in Klamath Basin water disputes in the 21stcentury. In 2013, the Tribe's water rights were enforced for the first time, in what is known as a 'Water Call'. The Klamath Tribe called upon their in-stream water right, which was enforced by the Water Master. This resulted in almost all upper-basin irrigation being denied water, except for groundwater irrigators. The Klamath Project, however, was not called upon.|$|E

25|$|In many locations, PV {{has reached}} grid parity, {{which is usually}} defined as PV {{production}} costs at or below retail electricity prices (though often still above the power station prices for coal or gas-fired generation without their distribution and other costs). However, in many countries {{there is still a}} need for <b>more</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> capital to develop PV projects.

25|$|The loss of {{political}} influence {{contributed to the}} difficulties of African Americans {{in their attempts to}} obtain extended credit in the late 19th century. Together with imposition of Jim Crow and racial segregation laws, whites committed an increased rate of lynchings of blacks, mostly men, beginning in the 1890s and extending to 1930. Cotton crops failed due to boll weevil infestation and successive severe flooding in 1912 and 1913, creating crisis conditions for many African Americans. With control of the ballot box and <b>more</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> credit, white planters bought out such farmers, expanding their ownership of Delta bottomlands.

25|$|One {{hypothesis}} for {{vulnerability to}} pre-eclampsia is the maternal-fetal {{conflict between the}} maternal organism and fetus. After the first trimester trophoblasts enter the spiral arteries of the mother to alter the spiral arteries and thereby gain <b>more</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> maternal nutrients. Occasionally there is impaired trophoblast invasion that results in inadequate alterations to the uterine spiral arteries. It is hypothesized that the developing embryo releases biochemical signals that result in the woman developing hypertension and pre-eclampsia so that the fetus can benefit from a greater amount of maternal circulation of nutrients due to increased {{blood flow to the}} impaired placenta. This results in a conflict between maternal and fetal fitness and survival because the fetus is invested in only its survival and fitness while the mother is invested in this and subsequent pregnancies.|$|E
25|$|While some {{research}} indicates that psychological resilience is a relatively stable personality trait, new research suggests that positive emotions are critical to trait resilience. This {{is not to say}} that positive emotions are merely a by-product of resilience, but rather that feeling positive emotions during stressful experiences may have adaptive benefits in the coping process of the individual. Empirical evidence for this prediction arises from research on resilient individuals who have a propensity for coping strategies that concretely elicit positive emotions, such as benefit-finding and cognitive reappraisal, humor, optimism, and goal-directed problem-focused coping. Individuals who tend to approach problems with these methods of coping may strengthen their resistance to stress by allocating <b>more</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> these positive emotional resources. Social support from caring adults encouraged resilience among participants by providing them with access to conventional activities.|$|E
25|$|Over time, Moroccan {{women have}} gained <b>more</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> employment. However, this {{quantitative}} increase in labor participation for women {{has not been}} accompanied by higher qualitative standards of labor. The labor of rural women in Morocco remain unacknowledged and unpaid. Women are put into {{a higher risk of}} poverty as their domestic workload is added onto their unpaid labor. This balance of domestic labor and work outside the home imposes a burden on rural women. Since the socioeconomic exclusion of women deprive them of the capabilities to be educated and trained for certain employment skills, their susceptibility to poverty is heightened. Low educational skills of women directly relate to the limited employment options they have in society. Although both men and women are affected by unemployment, {{women are more likely to}} lose their jobs than men. Recent research in Morocco shows that economic recessions in the country affect women the most.|$|E

25|$|The {{first big}} city to aggressively promote {{the use of}} Norplant was Baltimore. Baltimore {{targeted}} teenagers because the birthrate was three times higher than other states. In Baltimore, about ten percent of girls between ages 15 and 17 gave birth during 1990. Young mothers would often {{drop out of school}} and struggle to raise the child in poverty. The mayor at the time, Kurt Schmoke, pushed for laws that would give teen girls <b>more</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> Norplant. Norplant was eventually given to teen girls at schools without parental consent. Programs were designed for, and performed in, predominantly black schools. Laurence G. Paquin Middle School became the first school to provide Norplant to their students. Paquin Middle School had 355 female students but only 5 of them were not black. Their program started off as a pilot program and soon other urban high schools like San Fernando High School in Los Angeles and Crane High School in Chicago’s West Side adopted the program of providing Norplant to their students. Because of a focus on predominantly black schools, questions of racism arose amongst black community leaders.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{the peace}} {{settlement}} of the War of the Spanish succession, Britain obtained the asiento, a Spanish government contract, to supply slaves to Spain's new world colonies, providing British traders and smugglers <b>more</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the traditionally closed Spanish markets in America. This arrangement also contributed heavily {{to the spread of}} piracy across the western Atlantic at this time. Shipping to the colonies boomed simultaneously with the flood of skilled mariners after the war. Merchant shippers used the surplus of sailors' labor to drive wages down, cutting corners to maximize their profits, and creating unsavory conditions aboard their vessels. Merchant sailors suffered from mortality rates as high or higher than the slaves being transported (Rediker, 2004). Living conditions were so poor that many sailors began to prefer a freer existence as a pirate. The increased volume of shipping traffic also could sustain a large body of brigands preying upon it. Among the most infamous Caribbean pirates of the time, was Edward Teach or Blackbeard, Calico Jack Rackham and Bartholomew Roberts. Most of these pirates were eventually hunted down by the Royal Navy and killed or captured; several battles were fought between the brigands and the colonial powers on both land and sea.|$|E
25|$|Mark grows fond of Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin), {{who is in}} a rocky {{relationship}} with his enemy, Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). When she leaves Phil, she turns to Mark. Mark takes her in and they start dating, much to Pauline's horror. Together, they concoct a plan to pretend that she is expecting Mark's baby when Phil is the actual biological father. To facilitate their lie, Mark insists that he'd taken all necessary precautions in relation to his HIV and they fool everyone for a while. Mark loves Lisa so much that he stays with her after she shoots Phil (who survives), and Mark proposes shortly after baby Louise's birth. However, Louise's godmother, Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), tells Phil the truth about Louise's parentage and vows to {{take an active role in}} his daughter's upbringing. Mark and Lisa marry, but their happiness is short-lived: Lisa is still very much in love with Phil and Phil knows it so he seduces her in order to get <b>more</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> Louise. After Sharon discovers Phil's intentions, she talks him out of his plan and he ends the affair with Lisa, but Mark finds out and leaves the Square for a while. After just five months of marriage, Lisa leaves Mark and resumes her affair with Phil. However, Lisa soon realizes her mistake and wants to reconcile with Mark but Pauline refuses to tell her where Mark has gone.|$|E
