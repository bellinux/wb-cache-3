5|$|The <b>Marlins</b> {{franchise}} {{entered the}} National League in 1993 as an expansion team, and {{was known as}} the Florida <b>Marlins</b> until 2011. The franchise's first manager was Rene Lachemann, who accumulated 285 losses during his four-season tenure. Jim Leyland and Jack McKeon each guided the team to World Series victories, in 1997 and 2003, respectively; however, the team has never won the East Division. <b>Marlins</b> managers have never lost a playoff series, the only franchise in Major League Baseball to accomplish the feat. McKeon is the franchise leader in wins (281). Joe Girardi won the Manager of the Year Award in his only season managing the <b>Marlins</b> (2006); he is the only manager to win the award while fielding a team with a losing record, and the only manager to win with a team that finished in fourth place in its division. Jack McKeon was named the team's interim manager in 2011, having been named to the position following the mid-season resignation of Edwin Rodríguez. At the conclusion of the 2011 season, the <b>Marlins</b> hired Ozzie Guillén to be their manager for the 2012 season. After firing Guillen, the <b>Marlins</b> named Mike Redmond as their manager. Redmond was fired on May 17, 2015 and replaced by Dan Jennings. On October 29, 2015, it was reported that Mattingly would be signing a four-year contract to manage the Miami <b>Marlins.</b>|$|E
