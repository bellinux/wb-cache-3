5|$|The {{decline of}} the Roman Empire led to the {{disappearance}} or destruction of much knowledge, though physicians still incorporated <b>many</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek tradition into training and practice. In Byzantium and the Islamic world, many of the Greek works were translated into Arabic {{and many of the}} works of Aristotle were preserved.|$|E
5|$|It {{was again}} the two archbishops who {{conducted}} the negotiations between Béla and his son. Their agreement was signed in the Dominican Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits' Island (Margaret Island, Budapest) on 23 March 1266. The new treaty confirmed {{the division of the}} country along the Danube and regulated <b>many</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> co-existence of Béla's regnum and Stephen's regimen, including the collection of taxes and the commoners' right to free movement.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{understanding}} of Iguanodon {{has evolved over}} time as new information has been obtained from fossils. The numerous specimens of this genus, including nearly complete skeletons from two well-known bonebeds, have allowed researchers to make informed hypotheses regarding <b>many</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> living animal, including feeding, movement, and social behaviour. As {{one of the first}} scientifically well-known dinosaurs, Iguanodon has occupied a small but notable place in the public's perception of dinosaurs, its artistic representation changing significantly in response to new interpretations of its remains.|$|E

5|$|The Simpsons sixth season {{originally}} {{aired on}} the Fox network between September 4, 1994, and May 21, 1995, {{and consists of}} 25 episodes. The Simpsons is an animated series about a working class family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie.

5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet is {{a medical}} nutrition therapy that involves participants from various disciplines. Team members include a registered paediatric dietitian who coordinates the diet programme; a paediatric neurologist who is experienced in offering the ketogenic diet; and a registered nurse who is familiar with childhood epilepsy. Additional help may come from a medical social worker who works with the family and a pharmacist who can advise on the carbohydrate content of medicines. Lastly, the parents and other caregivers must be educated in <b>many</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diet {{for it to be}} safely implemented.|$|E
5|$|Trimmer's {{works are}} {{dedicated}} to maintaining <b>many</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> social and political status quo. As a high church Anglican, she was intent on promoting the established Church of England and on teaching young children and the poor the doctrines of Christianity. Her writings outlined the benefits of social hierarchy, arguing that each class should remain in its God-given position. Yet, while supporting many of the traditional political and social ideologies of her time, Trimmer questioned others, such as those surrounding gender and the family.|$|E
5|$|Considered one of {{the preeminent}} figures of the classic horror film, the vampire {{has proven to be}} a rich subject for the film and gaming industries. Dracula is a major {{character}} in more films than any other but Sherlock Holmes, and many early films were either based on the novel Dracula or closely derived from it. These included the 1922 German silent film Nosferatu, directed by F. W. Murnau and featuring the first film portrayal of Dracula—although names and characters were intended to mimic Draculas, Murnau could not obtain permission to do so from Stoker's widow, and had to alter <b>many</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film. Universal's Dracula (1931), starring Béla Lugosi as the Count, was the first talking film to portray Dracula. The decade saw several more vampire films, most notably Dracula's Daughter in 1936.|$|E
50|$|In July 2006, <b>the</b> Warren-Morris Council <b>of</b> Governments {{designated}} {{an outside}} consulting group as the COG's Shared Services Advisor to oversee <b>the</b> <b>many</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> coordinating <b>the</b> Shared Services initiatives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participating municipalities.|$|R
30|$|We will thus {{work with}} a notion of “State” and changes between states (which we usually call “Transitions”). How exactly to model an {{emotional}} or motivational state is not trivial, and we discuss these in more detail later. When we model emotions (as needed for affective forecasting, {{as well as for}} <b>many</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Self) we can start from the following concepts related to the impact bias [46]: the strength (or intensity) of an emotion and the duration [54]. Both of these can be quantified and included in a quantified model of emotions.|$|R
50|$|Based on this theory, {{things like}} color preference, {{preferred}} mate body ratios, shapes, emotional ties with objects, and <b>many</b> other <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aesthetic experience {{can be explained}} with reference to human evolution.|$|R
5|$|During his {{re-examination}} of Iguanodon, David Norman {{was able}} to show that this posture was unlikely, because the long tail was stiffened with ossified tendons. To get the tripodal pose, the tail would literally have to be broken. Putting the animal in a horizontal posture makes <b>many</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arms and pectoral girdle more understandable. For example, the hand is relatively immobile, with the three central fingers grouped together, bearing hoof-like phalanges, and able to hyperextend. This would have allowed them to bear weight. The wrist is also relatively immobile, and the arms and shoulder bones robust. These features all suggest that the animal spent time on all fours.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, {{archaeologist}} John Coles {{from the}} University of Cambridge began {{a research project}} {{that resulted in the}} publication of an important series of papers on <b>many</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Levels. A range of archaeological projects, such as the exploration of various trackways from the 3rd and 1st millennia BC and the establishment of their economic and geographic significance, was funded by various donors including English Heritage. Possibly the project's most significant excavation was of the Sweet Track in 1970, during which a Jadeite axe was discovered. Eight radiocarbon determinations of the date of the axe place it at around 3200 BC.|$|E
5|$|Lindqvist {{had insisted}} on writing the {{screenplay}} himself. Alfredson, who had no familiarity with the vampire and horror genres, initially expressed skepticism at having the original author do the adaptation, but found the end result very satisfying. Many of the minor characters and events from the book were removed, and focus directed primarily on the love story between the two leads. In particular, <b>many</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> character Håkan, including him being a paedophile, were toned down, and his relationship with Eli was mostly left open to interpretation. Alfredson felt that the film could not deal with such a serious theme as pedophilia in a satisfying manner, and that this element would detract from {{the story of the}} children and their relationship. Still, the film provided a few hints, of which Alfredson mentions one in the director's comments (Håkan likes children, for the wrong reasons).|$|E
50|$|From his {{consulting}} {{work and}} media presence, Michel Rolland has influenced <b>many</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> French and global wine industry. Among the prominent wine personalities {{that have been}} influenced by Rolland is the Rhone wine producer Jean-Luc Colombo.|$|R

5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{gameplay}} were reworked {{for this}} sequel. Some {{changes were made}} due to user feedback and others {{were meant to be}} included in previous games but were omitted either because of time or technological constraints. The camera was switched to the right analog stick of the DualShock controller instead of the shoulder buttons and the Gummi Ship travel was reworked. The combat system was completely redone and did not use any animations from the first game. Because Sora had matured, Nomura wanted his fighting style to reflect that. Other changes included more integration between exploration and battles. The variations in combat styles associated with each Drive Form and the introduction of the Reaction Command were added to give players more choices in battles. The inclusion of worlds based on live-action Disney films was aided by technology that generated the character models from live-action pictures.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys dimidiatus is now {{recognized}} as one of eight species in the genus Oryzomys. O.dimidiatus is further part of the O.couesi section, which is centered on the widespread Central American O.couesi and also includes six other species with more limited and peripheral distributions. O.couesi occurs with O.dimidiatus in southeastern Nicaragua. <b>Many</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> systematics of the O.couesi section remain unclear and {{it is likely that the}} current classification underestimates the true diversity of the group. Oryzomys is classified in the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys gorgasi is the southeasternmost {{representative}} of the genus Oryzomys, which extends north into the eastern United States (marsh rice rat, O.palustris). O.gorgasi is further part of the O.couesi section, which is centered on the widespread Central American O.couesi and also includes six other species with more limited and peripheral distributions. <b>Many</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> systematics of the O.couesi section remain unclear {{and it is likely}} that the current classification underestimates the true diversity of the group.
