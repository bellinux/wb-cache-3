40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to measure the lobar volumes of human lung using CT under physiological conditions and to define its changes during respiration. Chest CT scans were obtained in 16 healthy volunteers from the apex {{to the base of the}} lung at four respiratory levels; <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> <b>level,</b> half inspiratory capacity level, resting expiratory level and maximal expir-atory level. The outlines of the lung lobes were traced with a digitizer on CT film and the area of the lung lobes in the cross-sectional plane was calculated using a personal computer. The total area of each lobe?right upper lobe (RUL), right middle lobe (RML), right lower lobe (RLL), left upper lobe (LUL) and left lower lobe (LLL) ?multiplied by the thickness of the scan space gave the lung lobar volume. We calculated the sum total of five lobar volumes at three respiratory levels in order to obtain total lung volumes (total lung capacity (TLCCT), functional residual capacity (FRCCT) and residual volume (RVCT). Vital capacity (VCCT) was determined by subtracting RVCT from TLCCT. A good correlation was found between the lung volumes (TLC, FRC, RV and VC) measured by this method and those from spirometry in the supine position. The ratio of LUL to total lung vol-ume at the resting expiratory level, which was independent of respiratory effort, was greatest, fol-lowed by those of RLL, RUL, LLL and RML. As the respiratory level went up from the resting expiratory level to the <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> <b>level,</b> the ratios of RUL, RML and LUL to total lung volume decreased, while those of LLL and RLL increased. The ratio of LLL to vital capacity was greatest, 27. 7 %, followed by that of RLL, 27. 2 %; LUL, 21. 6 %; RUL, 16. 6 %; and RML, 6. 9 %. This method of using CT is useful and reliable for measurement of lung lobar volume. The measurement at different respiratory levels demonstrated the change of each lobar volume during respiration. Our method is expected to greatly contribute to clinical practice, e. g., diagnosis of diffuse lung disease which shows local volume change and determination of lobar resection operability for patients with poor pulmonary function...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: It {{is known}} that {{mechanical}} ventilation {{and many of its}} features may affect the evolution of inspiratory muscle strength during ventilation. However, this evolution has not been described, nor have its predictors been studied. In addition, a probable parallel between inspiratory and limb muscle strength evolution has not been investigated. OBJECTIVE: To describe the variation over time of <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure during mechanical ventilation and its predictors. We also studied the possible relationship between the evolution of <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure and limb muscle strength. METHODS: A prospective observational study was performed in consecutive patients submitted to mechanical ventilation for > 72 hours. The <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure trend was evaluated by the linear regression of the daily <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure and a logistic regression analysis was used to look for independent <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure trend predictors. Limb muscle strength was evaluated using the Medical Research Council score. RESULTS: One hundred and sixteen patients were studied, forty-four of whom (37. 9 %) presented a decrease in <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure over time. The members of the group in which <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure decreased underwent deeper sedation, spent less time in pressure support ventilation and were extubated less frequently. The only independent predictor of the <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure trend was the level of sedation (OR= 1. 55, 95 % CI 1. 003 - 2. 408; p = 0. 049). There was no relationship between the <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure trend and limb muscle strength. CONCLUSIONS: Around forty percent of the mechanically ventilated patients had a decreased <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure during mechanical ventilation, which was independently associated with deeper levels of sedation. There was no relationship between the evolution of <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure and the muscular strength of the limb...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{heart rate}} variability during an inspiratory muscle endurance protocol at three different load levels [30 %, 60 % and 80 % of <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure], in patients who had previously undergone coronary artery bypass grafting. Methods: Nineteen late postoperative myocardial revascularization patients participating in a cardiovascular rehabilitation program were studied. <b>Maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure maneuvers were performed. An inspiratory muscle endurance protocol at 30 %, 60 % and 80 % of <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure was applied for four minutes each, in random order. Heart rate and RR intervals were recorded and {{heart rate variability}} was analyzed by time (RMSSD-the mean of the standard deviations for all R-R intervals, and RMSM-root-mean square differences of successive R-R intervals) and frequency domains indices (high and low frequency) in normalized units. ANOVA for repeated measurements {{was used to compare}} heart rate variability indices and Student t-test was used to compare the <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure and <b>maximal</b> expiratory pressure values. Results: Heart rate increased during performance of maximal respiratory pressures maneuvers, and the <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure and <b>maximal</b> expiratory pressure mean values were significantly lower than predicted values (P < 0. 05). RMSSD increased significantly at 80 % in relation to rest and 30 % of <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure and RMSM decreased at 30 % and 60 % of <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure in relation to rest (P < 0. 05). Additionally, there was significant and progressive decrease in low frequency and increase in high frequency at 30 %, 60 % and 80 % of <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure in relation to the resting condition. Conclusion: These results suggest that respiratory muscle training at high intensities can promote greater parasympathetic activity and it may confer important benefits during a rehabilitation program in post-coronary artery bypass grafting...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} the number of maximal mouth pressure manoeuvres needed to obtain a reproducible value of <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> mouth pressure (MIP), we studied 44 patients with chronic airflow obstruction, with a mean (SD) % predicted FEV 1 value of 53. 9 (25), who were clinically stable. <b>Maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> mouth pressure was determined with an anaeroid manometer during <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> efforts in a quasi static condition at residual volume.

40|$|The {{gastroesophageal}} reflux {{disease is}} {{the return of}} gastric contents through the lower esophageal sphincter regardless of etiology, manifesting itself by symptoms (typical or atypical) or tissue damage. The diaphragm is the main respiratory muscle and its crural part {{one of the fundamental}} components of the antireflux barrier. Contractions of this are related to changes in pressure of the gastroesophageal junction that are usually related to breathing. Studies show evidence of diaphragmatic weakness in gastroesophageal reflux disease that can be improved with diaphragmatic training. The <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure is a simple method to evaluate the inspiratory force determined by diaphragm. From this context, the hypothesis that the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease may be associated with the <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure. Objective: to measure <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure and relate it to the symptoms and factors associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease. Methodology: it is a cross-sectional study in humans, where 404 patients were recruited in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. They underwent a clinical evaluation, measurement of <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure and upper endoscopy. Results: We studied 269 women and 135 men, mean age 44. 4 Â 13. 7 years and 40. 4 Â 13. 3 years for patients with and without deficit of <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure respectively. The weight averaged 72. 4 Â 21. 8 kg for patients without deficit of <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure, and 66. 4 Â 15. 5 kg for patients with deficit of <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure. In relation to the average height was 161 Â 0. 9 cm for patients without deficit of <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure and 157 Â 0. 1 cm for patients with a deficit of <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure. This difference was statistically significant for age, weight and height respectively (p= 0. 005, p= 0. 002, p= 0. 0293). The mean <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure was 69. 2 Â 22. 8 cm H 2 O, with 210 (51. 98 %) patients had a deficit of <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure. Two hundred and sixty-six (65. 8 %) patients had comorbidities. Sixty-seven (16. 6 %) patients had erosive esophagitis. There was statistical significance in the prediction of deficit of <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure from symptoms of dysphagia and excess mucus in the throat or nose, with p= 0. 0357 and p= 0. 0207, respectively. On the other hand, there was no statistical significance when the variable considered was esophagitis (p= 0. 38).

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Meridional Hospital, Cariacica/ES, Brazil. SUBJECTS: Thirty-two obese women undergoing elective open bariatric surgery {{were randomly assigned to}} receive preoperative inspiratory muscle training (inspiratory muscle training group) or usual care (control group). MAIN MEASURES: Respiratory muscle strength (maximal static respiratory pressure - <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure and <b>maximal</b> expiratory pressure), lung volumes, and diaphragmatic excursion. RESULTS: After training, there was a significant increase only in the <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure in the inspiratory muscle training group. The maximal expiratory pressure, the lung volumes and the diaphragmatic excursion did not show any significant change with training. In the postoperative period there was a significant decrease in <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure in both the groups.

BACKGROUND: The {{aim of this}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of a 12 -week swim training and inspiratory muscle training program on respiratory muscle and pulmonary function in competitively trained sub-elite swimmers. METHODS: A double-blind, parallel-group experimental design was employed to compare the effects of swim training alone, swim training with sham-inspiratory muscle training, and swim training with true inspiratory muscle training. Twenty-four competitively trained sub-elite swimmers combined swim training with either flow-resistive inspiratory muscle training set at 80 % sustained <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure with progressively increased work-rest ratios until task failure for 3 days/week (swim training with inspiratory muscle training, N. = 8), or swim training with sham-inspiratory muscle training (N. = 8), or acted as controls (swim training only, N. = 8). Measures of pulmonary and respiratory muscle function were assessed at the beginning and end of the 12 -week study period. RESULTS: At baseline, there were no significant differences (P > 0. 05) in respiratory muscle and pulmonary function between groups.

40|$|Purpose: Skeletal muscle damage occurs {{following}} high-intensity or unaccustomed exercise; however, it {{is difficult}} to monitor damage to the respiratory muscles, particularly in humans. The aim {{of this study was to}} use clinical measures to investigate the presence of skeletal muscle damage in the inspiratory muscles. Methods: Ten healthy subjects underwent 60 minutes of voluntary inspiratory threshold loading (ITL) at 70 % of <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure. <b>Maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> and expiratory mouth pressures, delayed onset muscle soreness on a visual analogue scale and plasma creatine kinase were measured prior to ITL, and at repeated time points after ITL (4, 24 and 48 hours post-ITL). Results: Delayed onset muscle soreness was present in all subjects 24 hours following ITL (intensity = 22 ± 6 mm; significantly higher than baseline p = 0. 02).

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the time-courses of lung function and respiratory muscle pressure generating capacity after spinal cord injury. Design: Multi-centre, prospective cohort study. Subjects: One hundred and nine subjects with recent, motor complete spinal cord injury. Methods: Lung function and respiratory muscle pressure generating capacity were measured at first mobilization, at discharge from inpatient rehabilitation {{and one year}} after discharge. Lung function was measured in all 109 subjects, and 55 of these performed additional measurements of respiratory muscle pressure generating capacity. Trajectories of respiratory muscle function for different lesion level groups were assessed by multi-variate multi-level regression models. Results: Forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 sec and <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> muscle pressure generating capacity significantly increased during and after inpatient rehabilitation. Forced inspiratory volume in 1 sec, peak inspiratory flow, peak expiratory flow and maximal expiratory muscle pressure generating capacity increased only during inpatient rehabilitation, but not thereafter. Increasing lesion level had {{a negative effect on}} all measured lung function parameters, as well as on <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> and expiratory muscle pressure generating capacity. Conclusion: Respiratory function improved during inpatient rehabilitation, but only forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 sec and <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> muscle pressure generating capacity further improved thereafter. In particular, expiratory muscle function and subjects with tetraplegia should be screened and trained regularly. © 2008 The Authors.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the {{respiratory}} muscle strength by evaluating the <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure (MIP), <b>maximal</b> expiratory pressure (MEP) and lung volume before and 3 and 6 months after adenotonsillectomy. This is an interventional, before and after trial. It was set at the Department of Otolaryngology. University of Sao Paulo, School of Medicine. We included 29 children (6 - 13 years old), both genders, consecutively recruited from the waiting list for adenotonsillectomy. Children were submitted to <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressures (MIP), <b>maximal</b> expiratory pressure (MEP) evaluation using an analog manovacuometer, lung volume, using incentive expirotometer and thoracic and abdominal perimeter using a centimeter tape. Children were evaluated in 3 different moments: 1 week before and 3 and 6 months after surgery. Results: MIP improved significantly 3 months (p < 0. 001) after adenotonsillectomy and MEP did not change (p = 1). There were increases in lung volume (p = 000), chest (p = 0. 017) and abdominal perimeter (p = 0. 05). Six months after surgery, all parameters improved. MIP (p = 0), MEP (p = 0), lung volume (p = 0. 02), chest (p = 0. 034) and abdominal perimeter (p = 0. 23). Conclusion: This study suggests that there was an improvement in respiratory muscular strength, once there was a significant improvement in <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure, lung volume and other parameters after adenotonsillectomy.

40|$|Reduction of {{exercise}} capacity {{in patients with}} ankylosing spondylitis is associated with skeletal muscle performance. The contribution of respiratory muscle performance is questionable. This pilot {{study was designed to}} investigate the relationship between respiratory muscle performance and exercise capacity in ankylosing spondylitis. Subjects were 12 patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Measurements of maximal respiratory pressures and inspiratory muscle endurance were performed and correlated with maximal exercise capacity. Lung function and chest wall expansion were reduced on average. <b>Maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> and expiratory pressures were reduced to 82 +/- 20 % of predicted values and 75 +/- 22 % of predicted values respectively. On average there was no reduction in inspiratory muscle endurance which remained at 103 +/- 36 % of predicted values. No overall reduction was found in maximal exercise capacity, either expressed as maximal workload or as peak oxygen uptake; however, a wide range was found. Maximal workload and peak oxygen uptake correlated significantly with maximal respiratory pressures and respiratory muscle endurance. The best regression model for explaining the total variation of maximal workload and peak oxygen uptake selected <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressures as the independent variable (r(2) = 59. 6 %, p = 0. 003 and r(2) = 62. 5 %, p = 0. 05 respectively.) These data suggest respiratory pressure and respiratory muscle endurance, in particular <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure, may be determinants {{of exercise}} capacity in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{measurement}} of <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> and expiratory pressures {{is useful for}} the evaluation of pulmonary function. However, the methods to obtain them are not always properly described. OBJECTIVE: To identify the difference between the peak pressure values (Ppeak, the highest pressure reached) and the sustained pressure (Pmaxs, the highest pressure sustained for one second) in MIP and MEP evaluation. METHOD: 55 healthy individuals and 50 patients who were taking part in a pulmonary rehabilitation program, all of them with chronic pulmonary disease, were studied by recording their best <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure and <b>maximal</b> expiratory pressure tests. The peak and sustained pressure values were compared and analyzed to determine whether there was a difference between them. RESULTS: The maximum inspiratory pressure records of healthy individuals showed that the <b>maximal</b> peak <b>inspiratory</b> pressure and the <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure found were, respectively, 102 ± 33 cmH 2 O and 92 ± 29 cmH 2 O (p < 0. 001), and those of the patients participating in the pulmonary rehabilitation program were 75 ± 23 cmH 2 O and 67 ± 22 cmH 2 O (p < 0. 001). The recorded values of maximal expiratory pressure, peak and maximal were 119 ± 42 cmH 2 O and 110 ± 39 cmH 2 O (p < 0. 001), respectively, for healthy subjects, and 112 ± 40 cmH 2 O and 103 ± 36 cmH 2 O (p < 0. 001) for the patients. CONCLUSION: There is a significant difference between Ppeak and Pmaxs, that can lead to different interpretations in the evaluation of the respiratory muscle strength. To minimize interpretation errors, the authors suggest the use of devices which record both values (peak and sustained) ...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Invasive {{mechanical}} ventilation {{is associated with}} complications, and its abbreviation is desirable. The imbalance between increased workload, decreased inspiratory muscle strength and endurance is an important determinant of ventilator dependence. Low endurance may be present due to respiratory muscle atrophy, critical illness, or steroid use. Specific inspiratory muscle training may increase or preserve endurance. The objective {{of the study was}} to test the hypothesis that inspiratory muscle training from the beginning of {{mechanical ventilation}} would abbreviate the weaning duration and decrease reintubation rate. As a secondary objective, we described the evolution of inspiratory muscle strength with and without inspiratory muscle training. METHODS: Prospective, randomized clinical trial in an adult clinical-surgical intensive care unit. Twelve patients trained the inspiratory muscles twice a day, and 13 patients did not (control). Training was performed adjusting the sensitivity of the ventilator based on the <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure. Patients underwent daily surveillance of the <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure. RESULTS: The weaning duration (31 ± 22 hr, control and 23 ± 11 hr, training group; P =. 24) and reintubation rate (5 control and 3 training group; P =. 39) were not statistically different. The <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure of the control group showed a trend toward a modest increase. In contrast, the training group showed a small decrease (P =. 34). CONCLUSIONS: In acute critically ill patients, inspiratory muscle training from the beginning of mechanical ventilation neither abbreviated the weaning duration, nor decreased the reintubation rate. Inspiratory muscle strength tended to stay constant, along the mechanical ventilation, with or without this specific inspiratory muscle training...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} whether {{patients with chronic}} airflow limitation have a specific alteration in skeletal muscle performance, the strength and endurance of inspiratory and limb muscles were compared in 11 patients with chronic airflow limitation and 11 control subjects during maximal voluntary contractions. Peak inspiratory pressure at observed functional residual capacity (FRC) was significantly less in the patients than in the control subjects (mean 72 (SD 25) v 93 (21) cm H 2 O), though only two patients had low maximal pressures across a wide volume range. Maximal voluntary torque of the elbow flexor muscles was also reduced in the patients but {{the difference was not}} significant (60 (17) v 72 (18) Nm). During the endurance sequence of 18 maximal voluntary contractions (10 s duration, 5 s rest interval) the decline in peak and average force was less for the inspiratory muscles than for the elbow flexors in both groups. Inspiratory muscle endurance was slightly greater in the patients with chronic airflow limitation than in the control subjects, whereas limb muscle endurance was slightly impaired in the patients. In three patients with chronic airflow limitation, two of whom had low <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressures at FRC, the ability to drive the diaphragm voluntarily was examined by stimulating the phrenic nerves during <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> efforts. Each patient was capable of full activation of the diaphragm during the <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> efforts. These results suggest that the relative preservation of inspiratory muscle performance in patients with chronic airflow limitation may be an adaptive response to respiratory "loading. ...|$|R
40|$|Question: Does inspiratory muscle {{training}} improve respiratory muscle strength, functional capacity, {{lung function}} {{and quality of}} life of patients with chronic kidney disease? Does inspiratory muscle training improve these outcomes more than breathing exercises? Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials. Participants: People with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis treatment. Outcome measures: The primary outcomes were: <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure, <b>maximal</b> expiratory pressure, and distance covered on the 6 -minute walk test. The secondary outcomes were: forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV 1), {{and quality of life}}. Results: The search identified four eligible studies. The sample consisted of 110 participants. The inspiratory muscle training used a Threshold® or PowerBreathe® device, with a load ranging from 30 to 60 % of the <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure and lasting from 6 weeks to 6 months. The studies showed moderate to high risk of bias, {{and the quality of the}} evidence was rated low or very low, due to the studies’ methodological limitations. The meta-analysis showed that inspiratory muscle training significantly improved <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure (MD 23 cmH 2 O, 95 % CI 16 to 29) and the 6 -minute walk test distance (MD 80  m, 95 % CI 41 to 119) when compared with controls. Significant benefits in lung function and quality of life were also identified. When compared to breathing exercises, significant benefits were identified in maximal expiratory pressure (MD 6 cmH 2 O, 95 % CI 2 to 10) and FEV 1 (MD 0. 24  litres 95 % CI 0. 14 to 0. 34), but not <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure or forced vital capacity. Conclusion: In patients with chronic renal failure on dialysis, inspiratory muscle training with a fixed load significantly improves respiratory muscle strength, functional capacity, lung function and quality of life. The evidence for these benefits may be influenced by some sources of bias. Registration: PROSPERO (CRD 42015029986).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} positive end expiratory pressure and physiotherapy intervention during Phase I of cardiac rehabilitation {{on the behavior of}} pulmonary function and inspiratory muscle strength in postoperative cardiac surgery. METHODS: A prospective randomized study, in which 24 patients were divided in 2 groups: a group that performed respiratory exercises with positive airway expiratory pressure associated with physiotherapy intervention (GEP, n = 8) and a group that received only the physiotherapy intervention (GPI, n = 16). Pulmonary function was evaluated by spirometry on the preoperative and on the fifth postoperative days; inspiratory muscle strength was measured by <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure on the same days. RESULTS: Spirometric variables were significantly reduced from the preoperative to the fifth postoperative day for the GPI, while the GEP had a significant reduction only for vital capacity (P <. 05). When the treatments were compared, smaller values were observed in the GPI for peak flow on the fifth postoperative day. Significant reductions of <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure from preoperative to the first postoperative day were found in both groups. However, the reduction in <b>maximal</b> <b>inspiratory</b> pressure from the preoperative to the fifth postoperative day was significant only in the GPI (P <. 05). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that cardiac surgery produces a reduction in inspiratory muscle strength, pulmonary volume, and flow. The association of positive expiratory pressure with physiotherapy intervention was more efficient in minimizing these changes, in comparison to the physiotherapy intervention alone. However, in both groups, the pulmonary volumes were not completely reestablished by the fifth postoperative day, and it was necessary to continue the treatment after hospital convalescence...|$|R
