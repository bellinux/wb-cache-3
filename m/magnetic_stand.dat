40|$|Abstract Background Malaria parasites {{generate}} free haem upon catabolism of host haemoglobin {{during their}} intraerythrocytic growth cycle. In {{order to minimize}} oxidative toxicity of the ferric iron, the free haem molecules are polymerized into the biomineral beta-haematin (commonly referred to as haemozoin). Haemozoin crystals are paramagnetic, and this property can be exploited for the purification of late stage parasites as they contain larger haemozoin crystals than early stage parasites and uninfected cells. Commercially available magnets that were originally developed {{for the purpose of}} antibody-mediated cell purification are widely used for this purpose. As these methods are not necessarily optimized for parasite purification, the relationship between magnetic field strength and {{the quantity and quality of}} yield during parasite purification was explored. Methods Inexpensive rare-earth neodymium magnets with commercially available disposable columns were employed to explore the relationship between magnetic field strength and recovery of free haemozoin and infected erythrocytes (iRBCs). Results Yields of free haemozoin increased nearly linearly with increasing magnetic field strength to the strongest fields tested (8, 500 Gauss). Stronger magnetic fields also improved the recovery of iRBCs with no detrimental effects on parasite viability. An in-house constructed <b>magnetic</b> <b>stand,</b> built for $ 75 in materials, produced superior results when compared with much more expensive commercial products. Conclusions Existing protocols for the magnetic purification of free haemozoin and iRBCs result in sub-optimal yields.

40|$|Background: High density single {{nucleotide}} polymorphism (SNP) genotyping array is widely applied on genome-wide association study of common diseases. In these studies, a fixed batch-size of 48 or 96 samples allows high-throughput analysis. To enhance the clinical application of microarray analysis on personalized medicine, we describe a modified PCR purification protocol without batch-size limitation for whole-genome scan using ultra-high density SNP microarray. Methods: Enzyme-digested PCR products were purified {{with the use of}} magnetic beads. Separation of the magnetic particles applies <b>magnetic</b> <b>stand</b> devices instead of vacuum pumps. With no batch-size limitation, we genotyped 17 genomic samples and 3 whole genome amplified samples in order to examine the performance of the modified protocol. Results: Our method is simple and fast, provides sufficient amount and high quality PCR products for subsequent fragmentation and labeling procedures prior to GeneChip hybridization. We show that the purified DNA can be genotyped with good QC call rate of > 93 % in average similar to standard protocol. With the use of the short protocol, we successfully identified the breakpoint localization of a ring chromosome in a female and located the disease gene in a consanguineous family affected by limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Conclusion: By modifying a single step in the original protocol, we are able to speed up the overall genotyping analysis and change the batch-wise analysis to random-access analysis for ultra-high density whole-genome scan for personalized medicine, positional mapping, and cytogenetic analysis. © 2009 Elsevier B.

Baylin Corresponding authors ([sbaylin 1 @jhmi. edu](sbaylin 1 @jhmi. edu); [vijay. tiwari@fmi. ch](vijay. tiwari@fmi. ch)) ### INTRODUCTION Progress in {{technologies}} to address long-range chromosomal interactions in vivo has extensively revised concepts about {{different aspects of}} transcriptional regulation. These methods allow probing physical proximities between chromatin elements without specifically identifying the protein components that mediate such interactions. Here we describe a detailed protocol for Combined 3 C-ChIP-Cloning (6 C) technology, which combines multiple techniques to identify the proteins that bridge distant genomic regions, while simultaneously identifying such physical proximities. This method is also useful for determining if a candidate protein might mediate long-range interactions, both in cis and in trans in the nucleus. We discuss how the 6 C technique can be incorporated with other techniques to discover all the chromatin regions in the nucleus that interact with a given gene or chromatin region of interest in a specific protein-dependent manner. Such information allows complete, cell-type-specific mapping of all the chromatin interactions mediated by specific proteins. The 6 C assay advances {{our understanding of the}} three-dimensional aspects of the higher-order folding of chromatin and provides an important tool to examine the role of specific proteins in nuclear organization. In addition to providing a detailed protocol of the 6 C technique, we discuss how this technology can be used by investigators working in the area of chromatin biology, with special interest in chromatin long-range interactions. ### RELATED INFORMATION The 6 C assay combines three different methodologies: chromosome conformation capture (3 C) (Dekker et al. 2002), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and cloning (Fig. 1). The first step involves conventional 3 C methodology: The chromatin is cross-linked, digested with restriction enzymes, and ligated under conditions that favor intramolecular ligation. Immediately after ligation, the chromatin is immunoprecipitated using an antibody against the protein of interest (i. e., the suspected “bridging protein” or the protein whose mediating physical proximities the investigator wishes to map). Thereafter, the cross-links are reversed, and the DNA is purified further. The fragments obtained are then cloned into a vector harboring the same restriction enzyme site overhangs that were generated in the enzyme digestion step of the 3 C portion of the protocol. The clones are further screened by digestion with the same restriction enzyme. Ideally, clones showing multiple inserts will result from the intramolecular ligation and should represent physical proximities involving the protein targeted in the immunoprecipitation steps. These clones are chosen for sequencing to reveal the identity of the partners. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1. ** Summary of the Combined 3 C-ChIP-Cloning (6 C) method. For a review of other recent methods developed to examine long-range chromosomal interactions in vivo, see Simonis et al. (2007).

It also determines the resolution of interaction maps that can be obtained using the 6 C assay in terms of defining the exact chromatin elements that are involved in physical pairing. Enzymes that produce cohesive ends from palindromic recognition sites are preferred in 3 C assays, and the six-cutters such as EcoRI, HindIII, and BglII are commonly used. These should cut every 4 kb along the genomic DNA and offer a good starting point. To obtain higher-resolution maps, frequent cutters such as MseI (predicted to cut every 256 bp) can be used.

Mix gently by pipetting. Incubate for 10 min on ice. - *Monitor lysis by observing an aliquot under a microscope. These conditions should be sufficient for most cell types. However, certain cell types might need different incubation times and/or different strengths of the buffer for complete lysis*. - Centrifuge at 1800 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant. - *At this point, the cell pellet can be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80 °C until use*. **Restriction Enzyme Digestion and Intramolecular Ligation** 12. Resuspend the pellet in 500 μL of 1. 14 X restriction enzyme buffer (appropriate for the restriction enzyme to be used in Step 16). 13. Pellet the cells by centrifugation.

Store at - 20 °C. - *This sample will serve as the “input” sample for subsequent analysis (see Step 37). Prepare one input sample for each treatment group or cell type*. 23. Remove an 800 -μL aliquot from the sample (from Step 21). Add it to 7. 2 mL of ChIP diluent (i. e., a 10 -fold dilution). - *Multiple ChIP reactions can be performed from one 3 C ligation reaction. The same ligation reaction can be split and used for ChIP analyses with different antibodies*. 24. Add 4 - 10 μg of the antibody of choice per immunoprecipitation. Rotate end-over-end overnight at 4 °C. 25. Prepare the magnetic beads: - i. Mix Protein G-conjugated beads:Protein A-conjugated beads (1 : 3) in a 1. 5 -mL tube. - *Each immunoprecipitation experiment will need 100 μL of this bead mix.

Prechill one 1. 5 -mL tube for each immunoprecipitate. 28. Transfer ~ 1. 5 mL of each immunoprecipitate to a separate prechilled tube. Place the tubes in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>stand</b> to collect the beads. Remove the supernatant. Add another aliquot of the remaining immunoprecipitate. Repeat until all the beads have been collected. - *Alternatively, pellet the magnetic beads in a centrifuge at 2000 rpm for 5 min. Aspirate some of the supernatant, leaving ~ 1 mL in the tube. Resuspend the pellet with the remaining supernatant and transfer to a chilled tube. Let the tube sit in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>stand</b> for 1 min to collect the beads. Aspirate the remaining supernatant*. 29. Remove the tubes from the <b>magnetic</b> <b>stand.</b> Place on ice. 30. Wash the beads four times with 500 μL of low-salt immune complex wash buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail. Agitate gently to resuspend the beads. Place the tubes in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>stand</b> to collect the beads. Remove the supernatant. - *Use fresh buffer for each wash. If the beads are stuck {{on the bottom of the}} tube, place on the <b>magnetic</b> <b>stand</b> momentarily to move the beads to the side and continue to invert*. 31. Wash the beads once with 500 μL of high-salt immune complex wash buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail. Agitate gently to resuspend the beads. Place the tubes in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>stand</b> to collect the beads. Remove the supernatant. 32. Wash the beads once with 1 mL of TE buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail. Collect on the <b>magnetic</b> <b>stand.</b> Remove the supernatant. - *The bead pellet is relatively loose in the TE buffer. Remove the supernatant by pipetting manually instead of vacuum aspiration*. 33. Centrifuge at 960 g for 3 min at 4 °C. Remove any residual TE buffer. 34. Add 210 μL of bead eluting buffer. Incubate for 15 min at 65 °C. Vortex briefly every 2 min. - *Alternatively, shake gently for 15 min in a shaking incubator pre-set to 65 °C*. 35. Centrifuge at 16, 000 g for 1 min at room temperature. 36. Transfer 200 μL of the supernatant to a new 1. 5 -mL tube. 37. Thaw the inputs (from Step 22). Add 190 μL of bead eluting buffer. 38. Reverse-cross-link samples (from Step 36) and inputs (from Step 37) overnight at 65 °C. - *Cover the tubes in the heat block with aluminum foil to reduce evaporation*. 39. Dilute the SDS by adding 200 μL of TE buffer. Add 8 μL of 10 mg/mL RNase A. Incubate for 2 h at 37 °C. 40. Add 8 μL of 10 mg/mL proteinase K. Incubate for 2 h at 50 °C. 41. Add an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol to the samples. Shake well. Centrifuge at 10, 000 rpm for 15 min. Transfer the upper phase to a fresh tube. Repeat this step with the upper phase. 42. Precipitate the DNA by adding a one-tenth volume of 3 M sodium acetate, 1 μL glycogen, and two volumes of 100 % ethanol. 43. Wash with 0. 4 volume of 70 % ethanol. Vortex gently after adding the ethanol. 44. Dissolve the pellet in 15 μL of nuclease-free H 2 O. 45. Test the success of the ChIP reaction using 1 μL of undiluted immunoprecipitate by PCR with primers specific for a chromatin region known to be occupied by the protein of interest in the cell type under investigation. **Cloning of 3 C-Ligated Immunoprecipitated Fragments** 46. Using standard cloning protocols, clone the 3 C-ChIP products (from Step 44) into a vector that has enzyme overhangs similar to those generated in the 3 C assay. - *This step typically involves cloning an “IgG/no antibody 3 C-ChIP product” and “Plus antibody 3 C-ChIP product,” in addition to regular cloning controls*. 47. Use the ligated vector to transform high-efficiency competent bacterial cells. 48. For experimental samples, spread the surface of LB-agar plates containing the antibiotic of choice (i. e., LB-ampicillin or LB-kanamycin agar plates), with 45 μL of X-gal and 9 μL of IPTG per 100 -mm dish before plating the transformed cells. 49. The next day, count the number of blue and white colonies in the bacterial plates from samples immunoprecipitated with the specific antibody as well as the controls (i. e., no antibody or IgG). - *White colonies represent bacteria-harboring plasmids with inserts, whereas blue colonies represent bacteria with plasmids without the insert. In an ideal 6 C experiment, the number of white colonies should be several-fold higher in samples immunoprecipitated with the specific antibody than in controls. This indicates that the pull-down with a specific antibody enriched specific protein-occupied genomic regions*. 50. Pick several white colonies (i. e., containing the insert) from the bacterial plates. 51. Use each such colony to inoculate LB liquid medium containing the appropriate antibiotic. Incubate in a shaking incubator at 220 rpm overnight at 37 °C. **Plasmid Purification** 52. Purify the plasmids using the PureLink HQ 96 Mini Plasmid DNA Purification Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. - *Alternatively, standard plasmid preparation protocols or kits can also be used*. **Screening for Ligated Partners** 53. Screen the purified plasmids (from Step 52) by digestion with the same restriction enzyme used for Step 16, using standard restriction digestion protocols. 54. Separate the resulting DNA fragments by electrophoresis in a 1 % agarose gel containing SYBR Safe. Use an appropriately sized DNA ladder for reference. Visualize using UV light. *See Troubleshooting*. 55. Sequence the plasmids showing more than one insert. - *Ideally, multiple inserts mean interacting partners*. 56. Sequence the inserts using primers from two different ends of the vector (e. g., T 3 and T 7 promoter-specific primers for pBluescript II RI Predigested Vector). ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: The fragments are too big, and/or there are more than two inserts in the plasmids. **[Step 54]** - **Solution**: Subclone the fragments into a new restriction enzyme-digested vector before proceeding with sequencing. ### DISCUSSION The 6 C-captured interactions should be validated by performing independent 3 C assays (Tolhuis et al. 2002), in which one performs 3 C-PCRs using multiple primer combinations from two different remote sequences. The primers for this purpose are designed exactly as described by Splinter et al. (2004). It also is important to establish, by using separate assays, that the interacting regions captured in the 6 C assay are truly occupied by the protein of interest in cells. To this end, perform ChIP assays (Tiwari et al. 2008) using antibodies specific for the protein of interest. The immunoprecipitated DNA can then be amplified using primers spanning the restriction enzyme site found to be involved in the 3 C ligation with other partner(s) in each of the 6 C clones. In early attempts of the 6 C assay (Tiwari et al. 2008), screening the clones by restriction digestion identified a very low frequency of clones having multiple inserts (five out of 352). A number of reasons could account for this. First, the rest of the clones that had a single insert probably represented distinct genomic sites that were bound by the specific protein (in this case, EZH 2) but were not engaged in any long-range associations. Interestingly, this might also reflect the frequency with which certain protein-dependent long-range associations take place in the nucleus. Second, the number of clones with multiple inserts might also be reduced because of difficulty in cloning (i. e., ligation and transformation) or sequencing of large fragments resulting from the ligation fragments generated by a six-cutter restriction enzyme (e. g., EcoRI). Third, intramolecular ligation after cross-linking and digestion will lead to a fraction of the DNA occurring as circular DNA that cannot be cloned; this might further reduce the number of clones in such an assay. Finally, the study could also have missed some interactions involving partners that bear DNA methylation at the EcoRI site (EcoRI is a DNA methylation-sensitive enzyme). Future work should develop strategies to tackle each of these issues to improve the overall efficiency of the method. The 6 C technique can be combined with other recently published techniques to discover all the chromatin regions in the nucleus that are brought in close physical proximity to the gene (or any other chromatin region of interest) in a specific protein-dependent manner (Fig. 2). Following immunoprecipitation with the antibody of interest, the samples can be subjected to 4 C analysis (Zhao et al. 2006) or reverse-cross-linked, purified, digested with a four-cutter enzyme of choice, and processed further for either 3 C-chip (Simonis et al. 2006) or the ACT assay (Ling et al. 2006). The 6 C procedure can also be used to reveal whether two known chromatin regions are brought into close physical proximity by a specific protein by following the amplification criteria used in the original 3 C assay, subsequent to the reversal of cross-linking and purification (Dekker et al. 2002). ![Figure 2]([URL] "Figure 2 ") **Figure 2 **.

40|$|The MESSENGER {{mission to}} Mercury offers our first {{opportunity}} to explore this planet s miniature magnetosphere since the brief flybys of Mariner 10. Mercury s magnetosphere is unique in many respects. The magnetosphere of Mercury is among the smallest in the solar system; its <b>magnetic</b> field typically <b>stands</b> off the solar wind only - 1000 to 2000 km above the surface. For this reason there are no closed drift paths for energetic particles and, hence, no radiation belts. The characteristic time scales for wave propagation and convective transport are short and kinetic and fluid modes may be coupled. Magnetic reconnection at the dayside magnetopause may erode the subsolar magnetosphere allowing solar wind ions to impact directly the regolith. Inductive currents in Mercury s interior may act to modify the solar wind interaction by resisting changes due to solar wind pressure variations. Indeed, observations of these induction effects {{may be an important}} source of information on the state of Mercury s interior. In addition, Mercury s magnetosphere is the only one with its defining magnetic flux tubes rooted in a planetary regolith as opposed to an atmosphere with a conductive ionospheric layer. This lack of an ionosphere is probably the underlying reason for the brevity of the very intense, but short-lived, - 1 - 2 min, substorm-like energetic particle events observed by Mariner 10 during its first traversal of Mercury s magnetic tail. Because of Mercury s proximity to the sun, 0. 3 - 0. 5 AU, this magnetosphere experiences the most extreme driving forces in the solar system. All of these factors are expected to produce complicated interactions involving the exchange and re-cycling of neutrals and ions between the solar wind, magnetosphere, and regolith. The electrodynamics of Mercury s magnetosphere are expected to be equally complex, with strong forcing by the solar wind, magnetic reconnection at the magnetopause and in the tail, and the pick-up of planetary ions all driving field-aligned electric currents. However, these field-aligned currents do not close in an ionosphere, but in some other manner. In addition to the insights- into magnetospheric physics offered by study of the solar wind - Mercury system, quantitative specification of the "external" magnetic field generated by magnetospheric currents is necessary for accurate determination of the strength and multi-polar decomposition of Mercury s intrinsic magnetic field. MESSENGER S highly capable instrumentation and broad orbital coverage will greatly advance our understanding of both the origin of Mercury s magnetic field and the acceleration of charged particles in small magnetospheres.

40|$|The {{biosensing}} {{field has}} rapidly grown {{over the last}} years with numerous biosensors being developed in diverse domains of life science research, medical diagnostics or industrial processes. This growth is also reflected in an increased value of the biosensor market, expected to reach 18 billion dollars by 2018. However, despite all the efforts, a significant gap remains between fundamental research and commercialization of biosensor platforms, which is especially pronounced for applications relying on the specific detection of proteins. Whereas high-throughput technologies based on highly specific nucleic acid hybridization have extraordinarily advanced in recent years, protein detection remains more challenging due to the complexity of protein-protein interactions. Consequently, there is a great need for better comprehension and improvement of protein-based biosensor platforms. In this respect, significant progress depends on several aspects, such as understanding the complexity of protein recognition biochemistry, reducing non-specific interactions on the sensor surface and attaining single-molecule detection. Over the last years, an important boost in the development of innovative biosensing concepts came from the introduction of biofunctionalized micro- and nanomaterials. Among them, <b>magnetic</b> particles do <b>stand</b> out because of their unique properties to get magnetized under the influence of an external magnetic field while offering large surface-to volume ratio and flexibility for biofunctionalization. All these features allow for highly specific and efficient capture of target biomolecules as well as their easy and precise manipulation. In this dissertation micro-sized magnetic particles were applied in bioanalytical tools with the dual aim of improving the characterization of individual bioreceptor-protein interactions and enabling their quantification at the single molecule level. In {{the first part of this}} dissertation different strategies for the biofunctionalization of magnetic particles with aptamer bioreceptors were evaluated. A protocol which allowed for high particle surface coverage, while maintaining good capture efficiency of the receptor, was successfully established. Subsequently, magnetic particles were explored as a tool in magnetic force-induced dissociation experiments with the aim to characterize bioreceptor-protein interactions. To this end, magnetic tweezers were proposed as a complementary technique to SPR for studying binding kinetics. They rely on the application of a controlled magnetic force to a biomolecule linked to a magnetic particle, with the main advantage to allow the study of multiple bioreceptor-protein interactions simultaneously, but with single bond resolution. In this dissertation, aptamer interactions with protein targets were studied using magnetic tweezers. The results revealed that these interactions occur through at least one intermediate state and two energy barriers, hence substantially contributing to the, so far limited, comprehension of how aptamers bind to their target proteins. This knowledge will undoubtedly propel further development of aptamers as bioaffinity probes. Magnetic tweezers were further challenged to study antibodyprotein interactions when biomolecules were immobilized on the sensor substrates following different surface chemistries. This research showed that dissociation parameters extensively depend on how molecules were immobilized on the sensor surface, both in force-induced dissociation and in SPR experiments. The observed differences were attributed to the inhomogeneity of molecular orientations as well as experimentally induced variations, and highlighted the importance of taking these factors into account when designing new bioassays. In the final part of this dissertation, magnetic particles were implemented in digital bioassays, i. e. digital ELISA, to capture individual labelled target biomolecules and isolate them in femtoliter reaction chambers. In these microsized chambers the signal from the reporter is generated and confined, allowing for subsequent quantification. Tau protein, recognized as highly relevant biomarker for early detection of Alzheimer’s disease, was used as a model system for developing a digital ELISA with clinically relevant sensitivity in attomolar range, both in buffer and plasma samples. Additionally, the performance of the developed digital bioassay was validated in real matrices by analyzing CSF clinical samples and comparing the results with a commercially available ELISA test. Although new challenges undoubtedly remain in further development of the Tau-specific digital ELISA, the reported results will significantly contribute to implementation of this protein as biomarker in the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Neuropsychotherapy {{is a new}} {{philosophy}} {{in the treatment of}} mental disorders that bases its principles in the application of the information we have about the brain activations and brain functioning to adjust the therapy to them, in order to center the process in how the brain evolves to its normal activations. New tools in the field of neuroimaging have helped in this process, providing accurate and detailed information about how the particular brain of each patient works. Between the many neuroimaging techniques available nowadays, the functional <b>magnetic</b> resonance (fMRI) <b>stands</b> out by its high spatial resolution, which allows a better knowledge of which brain area is activated before each stimulus or while performing each activity. The disadvantages this technique presents in terms of size of the scanner and restriction of movements give light to another technique, more suitable in certain domains: the electroencephalography (EEG), which provides a greater freedom of movement and higher temporal resolution. For the purposes of this PhD Thesis, both techniques will be compared, in order to find which one better suits our interests. For doing so, another factor will be taken into account. Due to the limitations the neuroimaging techniques have in terms of presentation of the stimuli, we are not able to expose the subject to certain kinds of real life situations. There is where the virtual reality (VR) enters the scene. With VR we are able to move the subject to a virtual world where any kind of stimulus is possible. In the case of neuropsychotherapy, it will allow the exposition of the patient to a situation related to his disorder, in a safer and more controlled environment. In fact, virtual reality has been widely used for the treatment of psychological disorders; but, until now, it has not been applied during the assessment of the disease. For the aims of this Thesis, virtual environments will be used for the assessment of subjects before and after undergoing a psychological treatment for a specific disorder, using neuroimaging techniques to find useful information that could help during the therapeutic process. As an example of disorder, the phobia to small animals (spiders and cockroaches) has been chosen, although the conclusions of this study could be extended to other kinds of psychological disorders. Before being able to assure that the brain activations obtained are related to the disorder and not to other issues, it is needed to measure the sense of presence the subjects felt during the virtual experience. This is why before the assessment of a psychological disorder, a study of the sense of presence in a virtual environment was introduced. This study also helped in the decision of which neuroimaging technique apply {{in the second part of}} the Thesis. EEG and fMRI were used for the measure of presence in the same virtual environments, and the results in terms of brain activations were compared. Presence was also measured by means of questionnaires, the traditional subjective way of measuring it. As a result of this study it is expected to check if VR could effectively stimulate presence and which neuroimaging technique is more appropriate for the targets of this Thesis. To sum up, the initial hypotheses of this Thesis are that: 1 - The new neuroimaging techniques can provide of useful information to use during neuropsychotherapy. 2 - Virtual reality would help in the assessment of the disorder, improving the accuracy in the way the subjects are exposed to the stimuli. 3 - The environments used would be immersive enough so the patient will feel present in them and feel them as real. For fulfilling these objectives, each of the two courses of work (study of presence and assessment of a mental disorder) was divided in two parts. In total, four studies were developed: 1 - Study of the sense of presence in a virtual environment using fMRI: the aim of this part of the Thesis was to check if the environments were able to stimulate the sense of presence, correlating the results with those given to questionnaires. 2 - Study of the sense of presence in a virtual environment using EEG: the aim here was to compare the brain activations obtained with EEG with those from the previous study, and if the responses of the questionnaires were equivalent despite being in a less intrusive scanner. As a result of these two studies, it was decided that the environments were immersive enough to induce the sense of presence, and that the best neuroimaging technique for the next part of the Thesis was the fMRI, due to the higher spatial resolution it brought. 3 - Assessment of a psychological disorder, pre-treatment: once decided the study will continue with fMRI, the areas related to a specific disorder (small animals¿ phobia) were studied using VR as stimulus. Until now, the assessment has been done using real animals as stimuli but not using VR, which here is hypothesized to allow a better approach to the phobic experience than the view of photographs or videos of real animals. 4 - Assessment of the state of subjects with a psychological disorder, post-treatment: once the patients had underwent a treatment to cure the disorder, they were assessed again to check if the brain areas related to the phobia stopped being activated after it. As a result of this second part of the Thesis, the brain areas related to the phobia (that stopped being activated after the treatment) were obtained, and this information is hoped to be useful in future neuropsychotherapeutic works, for the better adjustment of the disorder. In conclusion, this PhD Thesis studies the advantages that the new neuroimaging techniques and virtual reality could bring to the study of neuropsychotherapy. Clemente Bellido, M. (2014).
