25|$|The {{components}} {{include the}} yoke, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>coil,</b> the poles, the polepiece, and the external control circuitry. The pole piece must be manufactured {{in a very}} symmetrical manner, as this provides the boundary conditions for the magnetic field that forms the lens. Imperfections {{in the manufacture of}} the pole piece can induce severe distortions in the magnetic field symmetry, which induce distortions that will ultimately limit the lenses' ability to reproduce the object plane. The exact dimensions of the gap, pole piece internal diameter and taper, as well as the overall design of the lens is often performed by finite element analysis of the magnetic field, whilst considering the thermal and electrical constraints of the design.|$|E
