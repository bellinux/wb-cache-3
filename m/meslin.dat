5000|$|There may {{be other}} things {{contributing}} to a person's apathy. Activist David <b>Meslin</b> argues that people often care, and that apathy is often the result of social systems actively obstructing engagement and involvement. He describes various obstacles that prevent people from knowing how or why they might get involved in something. <b>Meslin</b> focuses on design choices that unintentionally or intentionally exclude people. These include: capitalistic media systems that have no provisions for ideas that are not immediately (monetarily) profitable, government and political media (e.g. notices) that {{make it difficult for}} potentially interested individuals to find relevant information, and media portrayals of heroes as [...] "chosen" [...] by outside forces rather than self-motivated. He moves that we redefine social apathy to think of it, not as a population that is stupid or lazy, but as a result of poorly designed systems that fail to invite others to participate.|$|E

5000|$|He {{was born}} at <b>Meslin</b> L'Eveque near Ath in Hainaut as Michel De Bay. Educated at the Catholic University of Leuven, he studied {{philosophy}} and theology with distinguished success, and was rewarded {{by a series of}} academic appointments. In 1552 Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, appointed him professor of scriptural interpretation in the university. In 1563 he was nominated one of the Belgian representatives at the Council of Trent, but arrived too late to take an important part in its deliberations. Indeed, there was resistance to his presence at the Council, and he was allowed to attend only {{under the auspices of the}} King of Spain. The Council Fathers looked upon him with not a little suspicion. At Leuven, however, he obtained a great name as a leader in the anti-scholastic reaction of the 16th century. The champions of this reaction fought under the banner of Augustine of Hippo though paradoxically undermined Augustine's doctrine of grace; as a result, Baius' heterodox-Augustinian predilections brought him into conflict with Rome on questions of grace, free-will and the like. [...] In various respects, Baius was rightly seen as Pelagian. In 1567 Pope Pius V condemned seventy-nine propositions from his writings in the papal bull Ex omnibus afflictionibus. To this Baius submitted; though certain indiscreet utterances on the part of himself and his supporters led to a renewal of the condemnation in 1579 by Pope Gregory XIII. Baius, however, was allowed to retain his professorship, and even became chancellor of Leuven in 1575.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} at <b>Meslin</b> l'Eveque near Ath in Hainaut, 1513, and died at Louvain on 16 September 1589. Though poor, he succeeded in procuring, in the various colleges of the University of Leuven, a {{complete}} course of studies, including humanities, philosophy and theology. His first appointment, immediately after his ordination, was as principal of the Standonk College, 1541. Three years later {{he was given the}} chair of philosophy which he retained till 1550. In that year he took the degree of Doctor of Theology, was made President of the College Adrien and also substitute to the professor of Holy Scripture, then absent at the Council of Trent, the full professorship following two years later at the titular's death. Baius had very early formed a close friendship with Jean Hessels. While the leaders of the university, Ruard Tapper, Chancellor; Josse Ravesteyn, Professor of Theology; were at the Council of Trent, Baius and Hessels profited by their absence to give vent to long cherished ideas and introduce new methods and new doctrines. On his return from Trent, in 1552, Chancellor Tapper found that evil influences had been at work and asked Cardinal de Granvelle, Archbishop of Mechlin, to interfere. Granvelle succeeded in quieting the innovators for a while, but Tapper's death, in 1559, became the signal of fresh disturbances. At the request of the Franciscans, the Sorbonne university of Paris had censured eighteen propositions embodying the main innovations of Baius and Hessels. Baius answered the censure in a memoir now lost, and the controversy only increased in acridity. Pope Pius IV, through Cardinal Granvelle, imposed silence upon both Baius and the Franciscans, without, however, rendering any doctrinal decision. When the sessions of the Council of Trent were resumed, in 1561, Baius and Hessels were selected to represent the university at Trent. The papal legate, Commendone, objected to the choice of the university, but Cardinal de Granvelle thought that the two innovators' presence at Trent would be good both for them and for the university. In 1563 he sent them to Trent, not, however, as delegates of the university, but as theologians of the King of Spain. Just before leaving for Trent, Baius had published his first tracts. Unfortunately, the contents of those tracts were not within the programme of the last three sessions of the Council of Trent, and no public discussion of the disputed points took place. It is known, however, that Baius' and Hessels' views were distasteful to the Fathers, and that the Catholic king's prestige alone saved them from formal condemnation.|$|E

Short and medium chain fatty acids could also modulate intestinal microflora: in rabbits, the antimicrobial activity of caprilic and capric acids was proved on various strains of Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli (Marounek et al., 2002).

40|$|Since the mid-Twentieth Century, {{doctors have}} been obliged {{in law and}} policy to inform their {{patients}} of mate-rial risks involved in proposed treatments, and to obtain patients ’ explicit consent for those treatments. Legally and ethically valid consent now requires the fulfillment of principles of voluntariness, competence, specificity, adequate disclosure, and understanding (Faden & Beau-champ, 1986). There {{are at least two}} serious criticisms of the current concept of informed consent. First, it is argued that patients might require different levels of competence to make different decisions, with higher levels of capacity needed to make decisions about treatment when the deci-sion is more complex or when the consequences of that decision are more severe (Kerridge, Lowe, & Stewart, 2009). Second, even though clinicians might seek to pro-vide comprehensive information about a treatment and present this in a way that minimizes the possibility of coer-cion, they can do little to minimize the influence of patients’ illnesses and social interactions on decision making (Etchells, Sharpe, Dykeman, <b>Meslin,</b> & Singer, 1996). Recognition and promotion of patients ’ autonomy has recently become a central tenet of health care. In terms of health care practice, this has involved recognizing patients...|$|E
