5|$|The Hungarian {{government}} recognised Croats as {{a minority}} native to Hungary; it has decided to implement the optional regulations of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages {{with respect to the}} Croatian language and establish a minority self-government for the Croatian <b>minority</b> <b>in</b> Hungary, guaranteeing cultural autonomy. The Croatian minority set up 127 local and 7 county self-governments in Hungary. There are concerns that Croatian minority rights in Hungary are being diminished, but the president of Croatia has assessed that both Croatian and Hungarian minority policies were appropriate. The Croatian <b>minority</b> <b>in</b> Hungary is particularly active in Pécs, where the Scientific Institute of Croats in Hungary and the Croatian Theatre have been established.|$|E

We briefly discuss how each discipline has attended to sexual and gender minorities to date, and suggest ways in which each discipline can enrich the other through collaborative scholarship on sexual and gender <b>minorities</b> <b>in</b> disaster. Importantly, we draw attention to critical limitations and occlusions concerning sexual and gender <b>minorities</b> <b>in</b> disaster risk reduction (DRR) policy and practice. Redressing these gaps in DRR globally should be a critical focus for future collaborative and applied research on sexual and gender <b>minorities</b> <b>in</b> disaster...|$|R
