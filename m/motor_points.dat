However, very few studies have directly compared the two stimulation techniques for assessing VA of the elbow flexors. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare TMS and <b>motor</b> <b>point</b> stimulation for assessing VA in non-fatigued and fatigued elbow flexors. Participants performed a fatigue protocol that included twelve, 15 s isometric elbow flexor contractions. Participants completed a set of isometric elbow flexion contractions at 100, 75, 50, and 25 % of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) prior to and following fatigue contractions 3, 6, 9, and 12 and 5 and 10 min post-fatigue. Force and EMG of the bicep and triceps brachii were measured for each contraction. Force responses to TMS and <b>motor</b> <b>point</b> stimulation and EMG responses to TMS (motor evoked potentials, MEPs) and Erb's point stimulation (maximal M-waves, Mmax) were also recorded. VA was estimated using the equation: VA% = (1 −SITforce/PTforce) × 100. The resting twitch was measured directly for <b>motor</b> <b>point</b> stimulation and estimated for both <b>motor</b> <b>point</b> stimulation and TMS by extrapolation of the linear regression between the superimposed twitch force and voluntary force. MVC force, potentiated twitch force and VA significantly (p < 0. 05) decreased throughout the elbow flexor fatigue protocol and partially recovered 10 min post fatigue. VA was significantly (p < 0. 05) underestimated when using TMS compared to <b>motor</b> <b>point</b> stimulation in non-fatigued and fatigued elbow flexors. <b>Motor</b> <b>point</b> stimulation compared to TMS superimposed twitch forces were significantly (p < 0. 05) higher at 50 % MVC but similar at 75 and 100 % MVC. The linear relationship between TMS superimposed twitch force and voluntary force significantly (p < 0. 05) decreased with fatigue. There was no change in triceps/biceps electromyography, biceps/triceps MEP amplitudes, or bicep MEP amplitudes throughout the fatigue protocol at 100 % MVC. In conclusion, <b>motor</b> <b>point</b> stimulation as opposed to TMS led to a higher estimation of VA in non-fatigued and fatigued elbow flexors. The decreased linear relationship between TMS superimposed twitch force and voluntary force led to an underestimation of the estimated resting twitch force and thus, a reduced VA...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanical}} twitch {{in response}} to increasing electrical stimulus intensity, delivered both over the <b>motor</b> <b>point</b> and <b>motor</b> nerve, was recorded in the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and the adductor pollicis (AP), and only over the <b>motor</b> <b>point</b> in the soleus (Sol), lateral (LG), and medial (MG) gastrocnemius muscles of human subjects. The relationship between intensity of electrical stimulation (ES) and twitch torque showed a positive linear regression in all muscles. In the FDI and AP the relationship was not significantly different when ES was applied at the <b>motor</b> <b>point</b> or over the motor nerve. At small intensities of activation, ES induced larger twitch torques in the MG and LG, which contain a roughly equal proportion of slow and fast motor units (MUs) compared to the Sol, which is composed mainly of slow type fibres. Moreover, the relationship between ES intensity and twitch time-to-peak is best fitted in all muscles by a power curve that shows a greater twitch time-to-peak range in its initial part for muscles containing {{a larger proportion of}} fast MUs (LG, MG) than for muscles mainly composed of slow MUs (Sol). In conclusion, these results induced by ES at the <b>motor</b> <b>point</b> and/or over the motor nerve confirm the concept of a reversed sequence of MU activation, as compared to voluntary contractions, and document this viewpoint in muscles of different function and composition.

The proposed technique is applied on data obtained from a male test subject.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the uniformity of the muscle motor point location for lower limb muscles in healthy subjects. Fifty-three subjects of both genders (age range: 18 - 50 years) were recruited.

The muscle motor point was identified by scanning the skin surface with a stimulation pen electrode and corresponded to the location of the skin area above the muscle in which an electrical pulse evoked a muscle twitch with the least injected current.

This report summarizes the complete worldwide multicenter experience with diaphragm pacing stimulation (DPS) to maintain and provide diaphragm function in ventilator-dependent spinal cord injury (SCI) patients and respiratory-compromised patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It will highlight the surgical experiences and the differences in diaphragm function in these two groups of patients. METHODS: In prospective Food and Drug Administration (FDA) trials, patients underwent laparoscopic diaphragm <b>motor</b> <b>point</b> mapping with intramuscular electrode implantation. Stimulation of the electrodes ensued to condition and strengthen the diaphragm. RESULTS: From March of 2000 to September of 2007, a total of 88 patients (50 SCI and 38 ALS) were implanted with DPS at five sites. Patient age ranged from 18 to 74 years. Time from SCI to implantation ranged from 3 months to 27 years. In 87 patients the diaphragm <b>motor</b> <b>point</b> was mapped with successful implantation of electrodes with the only failure the second SCI patient who had a false-positive phrenic nerve study. Patients with ALS had much weaker diaphragms identified surgically, requiring trains of stimulation during mapping to identify the <b>motor</b> <b>point</b> at times. There was no perioperative mortality even in ALS patients with forced vital capacity (FVC) below 50 % predicted. There was no cardiac involvement from diaphragm pacing even when analyzed in ten patients who had pre-existing cardiac pacemakers. No infections occurred even with simultaneous gastrostomy tube placements for ALS patients. In the SCI patients 96 % {{were able to use}} DPS to provide ventilation replacing their mechanical ventilators and in the ALS studies patients have been able to delay the need for mechanical ventilation up to 24 months.

Voluntary fatigue was induced with a 2 -min maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle. On another occasion, "electrical fatigue" was induced with trains of shocks delivered for 2 min over the FDI <b>motor</b> <b>point.</b> Five of the twelve subjects also underwent "sequential fatigue" consisting of a 2 -min MVC of FDI followed by 20 min of rest and then 2 min of <b>motor</b> <b>point</b> stimulation. Voluntary fatigue induced MEP depression that persisted for at least 20 min. Electrical fatigue induced a transient MEP facilitation that subsided 20 min after the stimulation and became depressed within 30 min. Thus MEP depression can be induced by both voluntary and electrical fatigue. With electrical fatigue, the initial depression is "masked" by transient MEP facilitation, reflecting cortical plasticity induced by the prolonged electrical stimulation.

Methods: Using TCMS, stimulus response curves were constructed before and following a 1 h period of associative stimulation of two muscles <b>motor</b> <b>points.</b> The effect of an asynchronous peripheral stimulation paradigm was investigated in a separate series of control experiments. Results: One hour of associative stimulation of two muscles <b>motor</b> <b>points</b> resulted in a significant increase in the excitability of the corticospinal projection to those stimulated muscles. The increase in excitability peaked 1 h following the stimulation period. This increase in excitability did not generalise to either adjacent or more remote muscles. The control stimulation paradigm produced no significant change in corticospinal excitability. Conclusions: These results confirm the importance of associative input for the induction of plasticity in the human motor cortex.

40|$|During {{sustained}} maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs), most fatigue occurs {{within the}} muscle, but some occurs because voluntary {{activation of the}} muscle declines (central fatigue), and some of this reflects suboptimal output from the motor cortex (supraspinal fatigue). This study examines whether supraspinal fatigue occurs during a sustained submaximal contraction of 5 % MVC. Eight subjects sustained an isometric elbow flexion of 5 % MVC for 70 min. Brief MVCs were performed every 3 min, with stimulation of the <b>motor</b> <b>point,</b> <b>motor</b> cortex, and brachial plexus. Perceived effort and pain, elbow flexion torque, and surface EMGs from biceps and brachioradialis were recorded. During the sustained 5 % contraction, perceived effort increased from 0. 5 to 3. 9 (out of 10), and elbow flexor EMG increased steadily by ~ 60 – 80 %. Torque during brief MVCs fell to 72 % of control values, while both the resting twitch and EMG declined progressively. Thus the sustained weak contraction caused fatigue, some of which was due to peripheral mechanisms. Voluntary activation measured by <b>motor</b> <b>point</b> and <b>motor</b> cortex stimulation methods fell to 90 % and 80 %, respectively. Thus some of the fatigue was central. Calculations based on the fall in voluntary activation measured with cortical stimulation indicate that {{about two-thirds of the}} fatigue was due to supraspinal mechanisms. Therefore, sustained performance of a very low-force contraction produces a progressive inability to drive the motor cortex optimally during brief MVCs. The effect of central fatigue on performance of the weak contraction is less clear, but it may contribute to the increase in perceived effort...|$|R

This study aims to investigate the feasibility of using Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation to detect the <b>motor</b> <b>points</b> of the abdominal muscles, and to evaluate the intrasubject repeatability and intersubject uniformity of their positions, to find the most suitable AFES electrode location.   Low frequency stimulation (0. 5 Hz) was applied to the abdominal muscles of 10 able bodied and five tetraplegic participants. The electrode positions which achieved the strongest muscle contractions were recorded as the motor point positions, with measurements repeated once. For five able bodied participants, assessments were repeated after 18 months, in seated and supine positions.   Intersubject uniformity ranged from 2. 8 to 8. 8 %. Motor point positions were identified with intrasubject repeatability of < 1. 7 cm, deemed adequate relative to standard AFES electrode size. Intrasubject repeatability shows motor point positions changed little (< 1. 7 cm) after 18 months but varied between seated and supine positions with repeatability of up to 3. 1 cm.   A simple technique to locate the <b>motor</b> <b>points</b> of the abdominal muscles is presented and shown to have an adequate intrasubject repeatability, enabling the optimum AFES electrode location to be identified for each user...|$|E
40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. BACKGROUND: The applied {{definition}} of traumatic {{central cord syndrome}} (TCCS) lacks specific quantified diagnostic criteria. OBJECTIVE: To review currently applied TCCS diagnostic criteria and quantitative data regarding the 'disproportionate weakness' between {{the upper and lower}} extremities described in original studies reporting on TCCS subjects. METHODS: A MEDLINE (1966 to 2008) literature search was conducted. The descriptors applied to define TCCS were extracted from all included articles. We included original studies that reported on the differences in motor score (based on the Medical Research Council scale) between the total upper extremity motor score (UEMS) and the total lower extremity motor score (LEMS), in a minimum of five TCCS patients at the time of hospital admission. The mean difference between the total UEMS and the total LEMS of the patients included in each study was calculated. Case reports were excluded. RESULTS: None of the identified studies on TCCS patients reported inclusion and/or exclusion criteria using a quantified difference between the UEMS and LEMS. Out of 30 retrieved studies, we identified seven different clinical descriptors that have been applied as TCCS diagnostic criteria. Nine studies reporting on a total of 312 TCCS patients were eligible for analysis. The mean total UEMS was 10. 5 <b>motor</b> <b>points</b> lower than the mean total LEMS. CONCLUSIONS: There is no consensus on the diagnostic criteria for TCCS. Nevertheless, this review revealed an average of 10 <b>motor</b> <b>points</b> between the UEMS and LEMS as a possible TCCS diagnostic criterion. However, further discussion by an expert panel will be required to establish definitive diagnostic criteria...|$|E
40|$|A new surface {{technique}} for the conduction {{study of the}} lower intercostal nerves has been developed and applied to 30 normal subjects. The problem of the short available nerve segment of the intercostal nerves and the bizzare compound motor action potential (CMAP) of inconsistent latency while recording over the intercostal muscles, is overcome by applying recording electrodes over the rectus abdominis muscle and stimulating the nerves at two points at a fair distance away. With {{the use of multiple}} recording sites over the rectus abdominis, the <b>motor</b> <b>points</b> for different intercostal nerves were delineated. CMAP of reproducible latencies and waveforms with sharp take-off points were obtained. Conduction velocity of the intercostal nerves could be determined...|$|E
40|$|Higher {{demands on}} the modern {{variable}} speed drives, push the operating conditions always on the edge, where more accurate information about various <b>motor</b> <b>point</b> temperatures are required. With {{the use of a}} multi-point continuous motor temperature measurement and a controller embedded motor thermal model, the actual temperature in various hard to access points of the machine can be estimated with reasonable accuracy. Intending to minimise wiring, the existing two wire over temperature switch connection between motor and drive is used as a physical layer for MicroLAN and over this lines, temperature sensors power supply and data are transmitted...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the use of}} computer-aided quantified analysis of surface EMG recordings. The measurements are {{used to calculate the}} average muscle fiber conduction velocity (MFCV) from two bipolar surface electrodes, placed parallel to the direction of the fibers of the m. biceps brachii between the <b>motor</b> <b>point</b> and the tendon. The time delay between the two signals is estimated with the cross-correlation method. Besides, the energy content (integrated EMG) and the frequency spectrum of the signals are calculated. Applications in the field of exercise physiology (fatigue studies) and diseases of the neuromuscular system are described. Zie: Summary...|$|R
40|$|This {{clinical}} note {{describes a}} typical case of dynamic varus deformity of the hind {{part of the}} foot in a head injured adult. Gait analysis objectified, by kinematic data, the perturbed movement of the rear foot in the frontal plane and identified, by dynamic electromyography, the overactive muscle (posterior tibialis) involved in the deformity. The diagnosis was confirmed by a <b>motor</b> <b>point</b> block of the posterior tibialis muscle with functional improvement. Kinematic data also showed improvement after the block. This case report illustrates the usefulness of gait analysis in diagnosis and management of gait disturbances in adult patients...|$|R
