40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} allocating resources to set up multimedia multipoint connections, while efficiently using network resources, in a network that includes signal converters to resolve the heterogeneity of customer/network equipments and information mixers for conference services. Specifically, given a connection request and a physical network, we consider the general resource allocation problem where the allocation costs of special resources and links are comparable so that neither can be neglected. The problem is shown to be NP-hard and the performance result of an optimal algorithm, several heuristic algorithms, and a distributed algorithm is presented.
