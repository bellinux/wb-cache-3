5000|$|Some {{restaurants}} - typically {{fast-food restaurants}} and cafeteria-style establishments - provide their menu {{in a large}} poster or display board format up high on the wall or above the service counter. This way, all of the patrons can {{see all of the}} choices, and the restaurant does not have to provide printed menus. This large format menu may also be set up outside (see the next section). The simplest large format <b>menu</b> <b>boards</b> have the <b>menu</b> printed or painted on a large flat board. More expensive large format <b>menu</b> <b>boards</b> include boards that have a metal housing, a translucent surface, and a backlight (which facilitates the reading of the menu in low light), and boards that have removable numbers for the prices. This enables the restaurant to change prices without having to have the board reprinted or repainted.|$|R

50|$|For {{fast food}} restaurants, a benefit {{is the ability}} to update prices and menu items as {{frequently}} as needed, across an entire chain. Digital menu boards also allow restaurant owners to control the day parting of their menus, converting from a breakfast menu in the late morning. Some platforms support the ability allow local operators to control their own pricing while the design aesthetic is controlled by the corporate entity.Various software tools and hardware developments have been created for the specific purpose of managing a digital <b>menu</b> <b>board</b> system. Digital menu screens can also alternate between displaying the full menu and showing video commercials to promote specific dishes or menu items.|$|E

40|$|OR, and {{the state}} of California have passed menu {{labeling}} policies that provide consumers with easy-to-find, easy-to-read nutrition information on <b>menus</b> and <b>menu</b> <b>boards</b> in fast-food and chain restaurants. Menu labeling has proven to be practical and low-cost for restaurants and widely used by customers. However, the restaurant industry continues to pressure legislators to oppose or lessen the scope of menu labeling policies. Now, they want to keep calories off drive-thru menus. Who does this help? The restaurant industry argues that they need “flexibility ” to post calorie information where it is convenient for them. But what is convenient for the restaurant might not be useful to customers. The fast-food industry currently generates about 65 % of revenues from drive-thru business. Informed eating on the go: Drive-thru <b>menu</b> <b>boards</b> in New York City show tha...|$|R

5000|$|McDonald's {{success in}} the 1960s was in large {{part due to the}} company's {{skillful}} marketing and flexible response to customer demand. In 1962, the Filet-O-Fish sandwich, billed as [...] "the fish that catches people", was introduced in McDonald's restaurants. The new item had originally met with disapproval from Kroc, but after its successful test marketing, he eventually agreed to add it. Another item that Kroc had backed a year previously, a burger with a slice of pineapple and a slice of cheese, known as a [...] "hulaburger", had flopped (both it and the Filet-O-Fish were developed in Catholic neighborhoods where burger sales dropped off markedly on Fridays and during Lent). The market was not quite ready for Kroc's taste; the hulaburger's tenure on the McDonald's <b>menu</b> <b>board</b> was short. In 1968 the now legendary Big Mac made its debut, and in 1969 McDonald's sold its five billionth hamburger. Two years later, as it launched the [...] "You Deserve a Break Today" [...] advertising campaign, McDonald's restaurants had reached all 50 states.|$|E

40|$|Many {{countries}} around the world have already mandated, or plan to mandate, the presence of nutrition related information on most pre-packaged food products.

40|$|Current {{strategies}} for combating obesity include recent federal legislation mandating calorie count postings in chain restaurants. This study describes the current practice of <b>menu</b> <b>board</b> calorie postings in a low-income urban neighborhood, identifies {{the extent to}} which current practice complies with existing policy, and evaluates the practical utility of menu boards to consumers. We conclude that although most postings were legally compliant, they did not demonstrate utility. Menu postings for individual servings are easily understood, but complex math skills are needed to interpret meals designed to serve more than one person. In some items, calories doubled depending on flavor and the calorie posting did not give enough information to make healthier selections. We identified specific strategies to improve practical utility and provide recommendations for policy implementation...|$|E
