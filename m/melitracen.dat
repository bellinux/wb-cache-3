50|$|<b>Melitracen</b> (brand names Adaptol, Dixeran, Melixeran, Thymeol, Trausabun) is a {{tricyclic}} antidepressant (TCA) marketed in Europe and Japan by Lundbeck and Takeda, respectively, {{for the treatment}} of depression and anxiety. In addition to single drug preparations, it is also available as Deanxit, a combination product containing both <b>melitracen</b> and flupentixol.|$|E
50|$|The {{pharmacology}} of <b>melitracen</b> has {{not been}} properly investigated and is largely unknown, but {{it is likely to}} act in a similar manner to other TCAs. Indeed, <b>melitracen</b> is reported to have imipramine and amitriptyline-like effects and efficacy against depression and anxiety, though with improved tolerability and a somewhat faster onset of action.|$|E

50|$|Flupentixol (INN), {{also known}} as {{flupenthixol}} (former BAN), marketed under brand names such as Depixol and Fluanxol is a typical antipsychotic drug of the thioxanthene class. It was introduced in 1965 by Lundbeck. In addition to single drug preparations, it is also available as flupentixol/melitracen—a combination product containing both <b>melitracen</b> (a tricyclic antidepressant) and flupentixol.Flupentixol is not approved {{for use in the}} United States. It is, however, approved for use in the UK, Australia, Canada, Russian Federation, South Africa, New Zealand, Philippines and various other countries.|$|E
50|$|Clomipramine was a {{predecessor}} to {{the development}} of the more recent SSRIs. There was, in fact, a time prior to the SSRIs when selective NRIs were being considered (c.f. talopram and <b>melitracen).</b> In fact, it is also believed that the selective NRI nisoxetine was discovered prior to the invention of fluoxetine. However, the selective NRIs did not get promoted in the same way as did the SSRIs, possibly due to an increased risk of suicide. This was accounted for on the basis of the energizing effect that these agents have. Moreover, NRIs have the additional adverse safety risk of hypertension that is not seen for SSRIs. Nevertheless, NRIs have still found uses.|$|E
40|$|A simple, {{specific}} and stability-indicating reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method {{was developed for}} the simultaneous determination of <b>melitracen</b> hydrochloride and flupentixol dihydrochloride in tablet dosage form. A Brownlee C- 18, 5 [*]μm column having 250 × 4. 6 [*]mm i. d. in isocratic mode, with mobile phase containing 0. 025 [*]M potassium dihydrogen phosphate: methanol (10 [*]:[*] 90, v/v; pH 7. 3) was used. The flow rate was 1. 0 [*]mL/min, and effluents were monitored at 230 [*]nm. The retention times of <b>melitracen</b> hydrochloride and flupentixol dihydrochloride were 7. 75 [*]min and 5. 50 [*]min, respectively. The linearity for <b>melitracen</b> hydrochloride and flupentixol dihydrochloride were {{in the range of}} 0. 5 – 60 [*]μg/mL. The recoveries obtained for <b>melitracen</b> hydrochloride and flupenthixol dihydrochloride was 99. 81 – 100. 77 % and 99. 42 – 100. 12 %, respectively. Both the drugs were subjected to acid and alkali hydrolysis, chemical oxidation, and dry heat degradation and photodegradation. The proposed method was validated and successfully applied to the estimation of <b>melitracen</b> hydrochloride and flupentixol dihydrochloride in combined tablet dosage form...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{optimized}} {{a simple}} rapid and elegant HPLC method for the simultaneous quantification of flupenthixol HCl (FLU) and <b>melitracen</b> HCl (MEL). The quantification {{is carried out}} using HPLC with UV detection. Combination of the studied parameters permitted the sepn. of flupenthixol HCl and <b>melitracen</b> HCl, which was best carried out using 0. 1 % trifluroacetic acid with acetonitrile and com. available ODS stationary phase column. The main feature of the method developed {{is that it can}} sep. and unequivocally quantify chem. similar compds. in a single run utilizing an isocratic elution profile. The retention time of flupenthixol HCl and <b>melitracen</b> HCl. were 1. 574 and 2. 183 min, resp. Some parameters (linearity, range and quantitation, stability of soln., precision, and accuracy) were validated. The method was accurate and precise and suitable for the intended purpose.

40|$|A gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) {{method in}} {{positive}} ion chemical ionization mode {{in combination with}} a solid phase extraction was optimized for new-generation antidepressants and their metabolites in postmortem blood, brain tissue, and hair. Twelve antidepressants and their active metabolites (i. e., mirtazapine, viloxazine, venlafaxine, citalopram, mianserin, reboxetine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, maprotiline, <b>melitracen,</b> paroxetine, desmethylfluoxetine, desmethylmianserin, desmethylmirtazapine, desmethylsertraline, desmethylmaprotiline, desmethylcitalopram, and didesmethylcitalopram) could be quantified. In this article, {{in addition to the}} validation of the GC-MS method, four postmortem cases are discussed to demonstrate the usefulness of the described method in forensic toxicology. In these cases, sertraline, fluoxetine, citalopram, and trazodone in combination with their active metabolites were quantified. Blood concentrations ranged from subtherapeutic to toxic concentrations, while brain to plasma ratios ranged from 0. 8 to 17. Hair concentrations ranged from 0. 4 to 2. 5 ng/mg depending on the compound and hair segment...|$|E
