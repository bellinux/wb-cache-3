5|$|The {{result of}} the lack of medical {{information}} on WSW is that <b>medical</b> <b>professionals</b> and some lesbians perceive lesbians as having lower risks of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases or types of cancer. When women do seek medical attention, <b>medical</b> <b>professionals</b> often fail to take a complete medical history. In a recent study of 2,345 lesbian and bisexual women, only 9.3% had claimed they had ever been asked their sexual orientation by a physician. A third of the respondents believed disclosing their sexual history would result in a negative reaction, and 30% had received a negative reaction from a medical professional after identifying themselves as lesbian or bisexual. A patient's complete history helps <b>medical</b> <b>professionals</b> identify higher risk areas and corrects assumptions about the personal histories of women. In a similar survey of 6,935 lesbians, 77% had had sexual contact with one or more male partners, and 6% had that contact within the previous year.|$|E

Through this technology, a <b>medical</b> <b>professional</b> can communicate with their associates and patients in an environment which is close to an actual clinical setting. This technology, however, is not yet to be widely adopted in actual diagnosis due to <b>medical</b> <b>professional</b> has no intention to adopt this technology. In other words, medical professional`s low motivation is the main impediment to low adoption rate of this system. In order to increase actual usage of real-time telemedicine system in diagnosis, this research aims to identify what the factors might influence adoption intention of <b>medical</b> <b>professional.</b> We began to use semi-interview and a KJ method to assess different types of system and identify the factors which might influence adoption intention of <b>medical</b> <b>professional.</b> Based on voice of <b>medical</b> <b>professional</b> and data derived from initial investigation, we proposed an acceptance model and hypothesized several important determinants and relationships which might influence the behavior intention of <b>medical</b> <b>professional.</b> Both of the psychological factors and perceived effect factors that affect <b>medical</b> <b>professional</b> {{have been included in}} this model. Then, by collecting data using experiment and online questionnaire, primary data were collected. Through analyzing the data by using statistic analysis method such as paired comparison and SEM model, our hypotheses in the model have been tested and our model has been remodified. As a result the model we proposed has showed critical factors which influences toward adoption intention of <b>medical</b> <b>professional.</b> It is expected to explain why <b>medical</b> <b>professional</b> has low intention to adopt this system, and what should be focus for improving intention...|$|R

5|$|The {{withdrawal}} method (also {{known as}} coitus interruptus) is {{the practice of}} ending intercourse ("pulling out") before ejaculation. The main risk of the withdrawal method is that the man may not perform the maneuver correctly or in a timely manner.

5|$|As <b>medical</b> <b>professionals</b> {{become better}} {{informed}} about the interdependent relationship between physical, emotional, social, and spiritual pain, and the demonstrated benefit to physical pain from alleviation of these other forms of suffering, they may be inclined to question the patient and family about interpersonal relationships.

On 24 June Marion Wallace Dunlop was arrested for writing an excerpt from the Bill of Rights (1688 or 1689) on a wall in the House of Commons. Angered by the conditions of the jail, Dunlop went on a hunger strike. When it proved effective, fourteen women imprisoned for smashing windows began to fast. WSPU members soon became known around the country for holding prolonged hunger strikes to protest their incarceration. Prison authorities frequently force-fed the women, using tubes inserted through the nose or mouth. The painful techniques (which, in the case of mouth-feeding, required the use of steel gags to force the mouth open) brought condemnation from suffragists and <b>medical</b> <b>professionals.</b>|$|E
5|$|Smith's {{departure}} {{provided for}} a period of expansion, both among the faculty and the student body. Former students of Nathan Smith's replaced him on the faculty, drawing <b>medical</b> <b>professionals</b> in the northeast such as Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. to join them. The first hospital at the school was founded by DMS alumnus Dixi Crosby in 1838, who used it to integrate academic instruction with hands-on patient care. In 1870, Carlton Pennington Frost, DMS '57, replaced Crosby as Dean of the school. Under Frost, the curriculum sustained another revamping, this time into a four-year program that included clinical and academic training. Frost also presided over the establishment of Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital in 1893, built to replace Crosby's defunct hospital.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{specific}} rules {{that apply to}} acts or omissions in homicide: an omission is criminal if the defendant fails to prevent the avoidable death of the victim {{where he or she}} has the duty to do so and that the defendant had the capacity to do so.

Like in other areas, a duty of care may now be owed, following R. v Evans, even where the dangerous situation which results in the victim's death was not caused by the defendant. <b>Medical</b> <b>professionals</b> may be relieved of their responsibility to sustain a patient's life, where terminating life support is dubiously legally classified as an omission.|$|E

5|$|Counseling {{about sex}} and {{sexuality}} by <b>medical</b> <b>professionals,</b> psychologists, social workers, and nurses {{is a part of}} most SCI rehabilitation programs. Education is part of the follow-up treatment for people with SCI, as are psychotherapy, peer mentorship, and social activities; these are helpful for improving skills needed for socializing and relationships. Rather than addressing sexual dysfunction strictly as a physical problem, appropriate sexual rehabilitation care takes into account the individual as a whole, for example addressing issues with relationships and self-esteem. Sexual counseling includes teaching techniques to manage depression and stress, and to increase attention to preserved sensations during sexual activity. Education includes information about birth control or assistive devices such as those for positioning in sex, or advice and ideas for addressing problems such as incontinence and autonomic dysreflexia.|$|E
5|$|Fatigue: fatigue is {{very common}} and {{disabling}} in MS, {{and at the same}} time it has a close relationship with depressive symptomatology. When depression is reduced fatigue also tends to improve, so patients should be evaluated for depression before other therapeutic approaches are used. In a similar way, other factors such as disturbed sleep, chronic pain, poor nutrition, or even some medications can contribute to fatigue; <b>medical</b> <b>professionals</b> are therefore encouraged to identify and modify them. A few medications have been studied to treat MS-related fatigue, such as amantadine pemoline (which is a psychostimulant also used for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy), or modafinil, as well as psychological interventions of energy conservation, but the effects of all of them are small. Fatigue is therefore a very difficult symptom to manage for which no drugs are recommended.|$|E
