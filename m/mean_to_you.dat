I shall sit in my chair, and sink a little down, and dream of these {{beautiful}} lights, these rolling, foam-flecked waves, these patches of blue and shifting green. I can form them in my brain. I can make a picture there, even though my fingers refuse to move. You are not an aesthete, I think, Mr. Hamel?

6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] he {{shut off}} her {{attempted}} objection. [...] "You would have destroyed my writing and my career. Realism {{is imperative to}} my nature, and the bourgeois spirit hates realism. The bourgeoisie is cowardly. It is afraid of life. And all your effort was to make me afraid of life. You would have formalized me. You would have compressed me into a two-by- four pigeonhole of life, where all life's values are unreal, and false, and vulgar." [...] He felt her stir protestingly. [...] "Vulgarity--a hearty vulgarity, I'll admit--is the basis of bourgeois refinement and culture. As I say, you wanted to formalize me, to make me over into {{one of your own}} class, with your class-ideals, class-values, and class-prejudices." [...] He shook his head sadly. [...] "And you do not understand, even now, what I am saying. My words do not <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> what I endeavor to make them mean. What I say is so much fantasy to you. Yet to me it is vital reality. At the best you are a trifle puzzled and amused that this raw boy, crawling up out of the mire of the abyss, should pass judgment upon your class and call it vulgar." ...|$|E

Think what it would <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> having a wife. Think of going out on a cold winter's night to crack a crib, knowing {{that there would be a}} cup of hot soup waiting for you when you got back, and your slippers all warmed and comfortable. And then she'd sit on your knee, and you'd tell her how you shot the policeman, and you'd examine the swag together--! Why, I can't imagine anything cozier. Perhaps there would be little Spikes running about the house. Can't you see them jumping with joy as you slid in through the window, and told the great news? 'Fahzer's killed a pleeceman!' cry the tiny, eager voices. Candy is served out all round in honor of the event. Golden-haired little Jimmy Mullins, my god-son, gets a dime for having thrown a stone at a plain-clothes detective that afternoon. All is joy and wholesome revelry. Take my word for it, Spike, there's nothing like domesticity." ...|$|E

"I know, I know," [...] {{said the}} doctor, sympathetically; [...] "life and {{enjoyment}} <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> the howl of a wolf in a forest, {{the call of}} a wild swan on the frozen tundras, the smell of a wood fire in some little inn among the mountains. There is more music {{to you in the}} quick thud, thud of hoofs on desert mud as a free-stepping horse is led up to your tent door than in all the dronings and flourishes that a highly-paid orchestra can reel out to an expensively fed audience. But the tastes of modern London, as we see them crystallised around us, lie in a very different direction. People of the world that I am speaking of, our dominant world at the present moment, herd together as closely packed to the square yard as possible, doing nothing worth doing, and saying nothing worth saying, but doing it and saying it over and over again, listening to the same melodies, watching the same artistes, echoing the same catchwords, ordering the same dishes in the same restaurants, suffering each other's cigarette smoke and perfumes and conversation, feverishly, anxiously making arrangements to meet each other again to-morrow, next week, and the week after next, and repeat the same gregarious experience. If they were not herded together in a corner of western London, watching each other with restless intelligent eyes, they would be herded together at Brighton or Dieppe, doing the same thing. Well, you will find that life of that sort goes forward just as usual, only it is even more prominent and noticeable now because there is less public life of other kinds." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{can hardly}} tell how, {{but even the}} first day a sense of {{something}} terrible spread through that multitude of people, to whom the words themselves were mere empty sounds. The captain sat through it, with his head drooping, till his face was out of sight, and the tears ran silently down his wife's cheeks; and the women round me were somehow awed into silence. When the men ended, and {{there seemed to be}} no one else to say anything on that side, the captain jumped to his feet, with a sort of ferocious energy, and shouted out, [...] "Are you all through, men?" [...] and their spokesman answered, [...] "Ay, ay, sir!" [...] and then the captain flung back his grizzled hair and shook his fist towards the sailors. [...] "And do you think I wanted to do it? Do you think I liked to do it? Do you think that if I hadn't been afraid my whole life long I would have had the heart to lead you the dog's life I know I've led you? I've been as poor as the poorest of you, and as low down as the lowest; I was born in the town poor-house, and I've been so afraid of the poor-house all my days that I hain't had, as you may say, a minute's peace. Ask my wife, there, what sort of a man I am, and whether I'm the man, really the man that's been hard and <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> the way I know I been. It was because I was afraid, and because a coward is always hard and mean. I been afraid, ever since I could remember anything, of coming to want, and I was willing to see other men suffer so I could make sure that me and mine shouldn't suffer. That's the way we do at home, ain't it? That's in the day's work, ain't it? That's playing the game, ain't it, for everybody? You can't say it ain't." [...] He stopped, and the men's spokesman called back, [...] "Ay, ay, sir," [...] as he had done before, and as I had often heard the men do when given an order on the ship.|$|E
