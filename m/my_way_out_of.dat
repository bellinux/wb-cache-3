500|$|After the April 10, 1967, {{recording}} session, the Experience {{spent the}} next two weeks playing shows and attending promotional appearances in England, including a spot on the BBC television program Monday Monday and BBC2's Late Night Line-Up. Chandler, Hendrix, and Kramer completed the final mixing of Are You Experienced at Olympic by 3 a.m. on April 25. Chandler had agreed to audition the finished LP for Polydor's head of A, Horst Schmaltze, at 11 a.m., so after a couple hours of sleep he prepared a suitable vinyl demo and traveled to Polydor. Chandler recalled: [...] "As Horst started to put the needle on the record, I broke out in a cold sweat, thinking... when he hears this, he's going to order the men in white coats to take me away... Horst played the first side through and didn't say a word. Then he turned the disk over and played the other side. I started thinking about how I was going to talk <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this. At {{the end of the second}} side, he just sat there. Finally, he said, 'This is brilliant. This is the greatest thing I've ever heard.'" [...] Horst immediately became an ardent supporter of the album and the band, championing the marketing and distribution of their debut LP.|$|E
2500|$|When Taishi Ci {{arrived at}} Pingyuan, he told Liu Bei, [...] "I, (Taishi) Ci, am a {{commoner}} from Donglai. I am neither a relative nor {{an acquaintance of}} Kong Rong. But I have heard of him and we not only share similar beliefs, but also experienced difficult times together. Now, Guan Hai and the rebels have besieged Kong Rong; he is desperately in need of help. You are known for your kindness, righteousness, and willingness to help those in need. Kong Rong admires you and has placed his hopes in you, hence he sent me to fight <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the siege to seek help from you. Only you can save him." [...] Liu Bei's facial expression turned serious and he said, [...] "So Kong Rong knows that Liu Bei exists in this world!" [...] He then sent 3,000 troops to follow Taishi Ci back to Duchang. When the rebels heard that reinforcements had arrived, they fled and the siege of Duchang was automatically lifted. Kong Rong regarded Taishi Ci even more highly after this event. He told Taishi Ci, [...] "You are a young friend of mine." [...] When Taishi Ci returned home and told his mother about it, she said, [...] "I am very happy that you can repay Kong Rong's kindness in this way." ...|$|E
60|$|She shrank {{back like}} a person struck, her face flamed; but the blood sprang no faster up into her cheeks than what it flowed back upon my own heart, at sight of it, with penitence and concern. I found no words to excuse myself, but bowed before her very deep, and went <b>my</b> <b>ways</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the house with death in my bosom.|$|R
6000|$|... "Out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>way,</b> sir! <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> this instant!" [...] cried a rasping voice. [...] "Drive over him, Hearn! Get {{down and}} pull {{him off the}} seat. The fellow's drunk--he's drunk I say!" ...|$|R
60|$|No {{words can}} be more exquisitely, and in all points, useless; and I merely speak of them that I may, at once and for ever, get them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> reader's. But to get that done, they must be explained.|$|R
60|$|There is, however, {{a chance}} of my finding <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> some of my perplexities, at any rate--if I can only wait till tomorrow.|$|E
60|$|So we march {{upstairs and}} make tea {{to fill the}} thermos flask. Then, with sack over my shoulder, I make <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Risveglio.|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{tell you}} the truth, my boy," [...] {{returned}} Dominick, [...] "I {{never thought of that}} till this moment, and I can't very well see <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the difficulty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now you see, Joseph and wife," [...] said Pumblechook, {{as he took}} me by the arm {{above the}} elbow, [...] "I am one of them that always go right through with what they've begun. This boy must be bound, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hand. That's <b>my</b> <b>way.</b> Bound <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You reproach {{me with my}} origin,' said Bradley Headstone; 'you cast insinuations at my bringing-up. But I tell you, sir, I {{have worked}} <b>my</b> <b>way</b> onward, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> both {{and in spite of}} both, and {{have a right to be}} {{considered}} a better man than you, with better reasons for being proud.' ...|$|R
50|$|In 1991, he and Stamey reunited {{to record}} an album {{entitled}} Mavericks. Holsapple also has one solo album, 1997's <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Way,</b> which is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> print.|$|R
6000|$|... "That wasn't the way {{you talked}} when I met you the other day; but it doesn't make much {{difference}} now, for I am beginning to see <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this snarl." ...|$|E
6000|$|The king did {{not answer}} directly, but after awhile he spoke: 'Why should I give away my BEST {{sporting}} dog. I can surely find <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the forest as well as this man.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't hurry," [...] he said, in full {{possession}} of his impudent good-humour; [...] "and don't lose your temper. Will you take <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> your difficulties, {{or will you}} not? Which is it--Yes or No?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Everything I’ve done is a {{statement}} on the, as they say, human condition...the way other people march to Washington, or set themselves on fire, or write protest letters, or go to assassinate someone. Well, I’ve had all the same feelings that these people had about various things, and <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out,</b> because <b>of</b> <b>my</b> inability {{to do anything else}} for various reasons, has been to make the protest through my artwork... H.B.|$|R
60|$|Soon Jones bade me {{dismount}} {{and make}} <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> upon one <b>of</b> the promontories, while he rode {{a little farther}} on. As I tied my mustang I heard the hounds, faint and far beneath. I waded through the sage and cedar to the rim.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She got a Kansas {{lawyer to}} say so, and he's got a Frisco lawyer {{to say that}} there's nothing of the kind. She hasn't played her game badly neither, for she's had the {{handling}} of her own money, and has put it so that he can't get hold of a dollar. Even if it suited other ways, you know, I wouldn't marry her myself till I saw <b>my</b> <b>way</b> clearer <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the wood.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Even now," [...] {{she said}} thoughtfully, [...] "I {{am not sure}} that I can trust you. I have a good mind to fight or scream <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this house, and go myself to see Victor." ...|$|E
60|$|This done, I {{made the}} best of <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the town again, and roamed the lonely moorland country which {{surrounds}} Frizinghall, until my watch {{told me that it}} was time, at last, to return to Mr. Candy's house.|$|E
60|$|He {{looks at}} us and we {{interpolate}} a word or so as she explains and feel {{a good deal of}} embarrassment at the foolish position we have made for ourselves. I determine to cut <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this entanglement before it complicates itself further.|$|E
60|$|Down I sat to {{wait for}} darkness, and made a hearty meal of biscuit. It was a night <b>out</b> <b>of</b> ten {{thousand}} for my purpose. The fog had now buried all heaven. As the last rays of daylight dwindled and disappeared, absolute blackness settled down on Treasure Island. And when, at last, I shouldered the coracle and groped <b>my</b> <b>way</b> stumblingly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the hollow where I had supped, there were but two points visible on the whole anchorage.|$|R
60|$|I was too dazed {{to realise}} very clearly what {{happened}} after that. Dompierre, I know, kicked {{open the door of}} the house, and the crowd rushed in, in his wake. I managed to keep my feet and to work <b>my</b> <b>way</b> gradually <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the crowd. I must have gone on mechanically, almost unconsciously, for the next thing that I remember with any distinctness was that I found myself once more speeding down the Rue Blanche, with all the yelling and shouting some little way behind me.|$|R
60|$|Well, I did {{not find}} that, but I did find the receipt from the Mont de Piété for a parure of {{emeralds}} on which half a million francs had been lent. This I carefully put away in my waistcoat pocket, but as {{there was nothing else}} I wished to do just then I extinguished the light and made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> cautiously <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the apartment and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the house. No one had seen me enter or go out, and M. le Marquis had not stirred while I went through his pockets.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I hoped not too. I warn't a bit {{tired of}} life, but I {{did not see}} <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it. However, I had one comfort: I knew if any two men {{could get out of}} an ugly mess, those two men were Rube and I.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I did," [...] Bartley assented. [...] "And I haven't {{given up}} the notion yet. I've read {{a good deal of}} law already; but when I came up to Boston, I had to go into {{newspaper}} work till I could see <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the woods." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hoped not too. I warn't a bit {{tired of}} life, but I {{did not see}} <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it. However, I had one comfort: I knew if any two men {{could get out of}} an ugly mess, those two men were Rube and I.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you worry," [...] he said, {{in a lower}} tone. [...] "I know <b>my</b> <b>way</b> in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the ropes}} here better than you can teach me. A big hotel like this is the safest and the most {{dangerous}} place in the world--just how you choose to make it. You've got to bluff 'em all the time. That's why I brought the young lady--particular friend of mine--real nice girl, too!" ...|$|R
50|$|In a {{retrospective}} review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave <b>My</b> <b>Way</b> four <b>out</b> <b>of</b> five stars and praised Usher's vocal restraint, but noted inconsistency in quality. In a 2002 review, Q magazine also gave it four stars and wrote that it established Usher's {{reputation as a}} young and skillful performer of R&B slow jams. Keith Harris, writing in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), gave it three-and-a-half stars and said that, although Dupri's combination of hi-hat hits, acoustic-guitar arpeggios, and occasional guest raps from him and Lil Kim can inhibit the album, <b>My</b> <b>Way</b> {{was the work of}} a significant, enterprising artist. Yahoo! Music's Billy Johnson Jr. credited the album for Usher's breakthrough into the music industry, and lauded the production of the three singles.|$|R
50|$|There was {{probably}} a period when I was reading and trying to imitate Lovecraft, whilst equally exploring {{what was then a}} considerably ruined Merseyside landscape. Whole slews of ruined streets, which I was perfectly happy to wander through on <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to odd, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>way</b> cinemas. And because I saw the city all around me as this kind of gothic, almost supernatural landscape, I think a lot of that fed into my writing.|$|R
60|$|So I {{got down}} softly from my perch and made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the yard, and, after {{fulfilling}} {{my part of}} the bargain with René, across to the Vigne d'Or and to my room, there to sit and mature the plan that of a sudden I had conceived.|$|E
60|$|She {{received}} this with another and more indignant 'Pah!' and I made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her room (I think I felt {{my way out}} with my hands, although my eyes were open), almost suspecting that my voice had a repulsive sound, and that I was a repulsive object.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Mr Blurt," [...] said Aspel, {{suddenly}} recovering {{something of}} his wonted bold and hearty manner; [...] "I {{have been in}} bad company, you see, and had to fight <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it. London is a more difficult and dangerous place to get on in than I had imagined at first." ...|$|E
60|$|O'FLAHERTY. If you'd {{been brought}} up by my mother, sir, you'd {{know better than to}} joke about her. What I'm telling you is the truth; and I wouldn't tell it to you if I could see <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the fix I'll be in when my mother comes here this day to see her boy in his glory, and she after {{thinking}} all the time it was against the English I was fighting.|$|R
60|$|Not knowing whithersoever I {{ought to}} go; but {{having in mind}} a clear idea that I must make <b>my</b> <b>way</b> so far <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the town as to lessen the danger of coming upon a squad of lobster backs, I pushed him on until we were come to Boling Green, and then made a {{straight}} cut across Cambridge street, heading for Beacon hill at a smart pace until we were 'twixt there and the rope walk, where {{it seemed to me}} we were past the danger line for the time being.|$|R
25|$|My dad was not {{the monster}} my lying brother said he was; he was strict, but my father never beat us black and blue, and my brother Gary was a vicious, no-good liar for saying so. I have nothing but fond {{memories}} of Dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him. To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging Dad's name through the mud. He wrote Going <b>My</b> Own <b>Way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name {{was the only way}} he could do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity. That was {{the only way he could}} get his ugly, no-talent face on television and in the newspapers. My dad was my hero. I loved him very much. He loved all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.|$|R
