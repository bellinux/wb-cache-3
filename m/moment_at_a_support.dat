Small strips of the hat-section cross-sections {{can be used to}} gather insight into the differences of the two failure mechanisms. For small corner radii, strip behaviour and section behaviour are comparable. For large corner radii, this is not the case.

40|$|Hat-sections of {{thin-walled}} steel {{are subject}} to a concentrated load and <b>a</b> bending <b>moment</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> interior <b>support.</b> For <b>a</b> large concentrated load and a small bending moment, two failure mechanisms can occur: the yield-arc and the rolling mechanisms. Research indicated that the corner radius has a strong influence on the failure mechanism to occur [1 - 2 }. It has been investigated whether small strips of the hat-section cross-sections {{can be used to}} gather insight into the differences of the two failure mechanisms. For small corner radii, strip behaviour and section behaviour are comparable. For large corner radii, this is not the case. Finite element models have been used to describe the cross-sectional behaviour of hat-sections for varying corner radii. Relatively simple analytical models have been derived which determine the location of first yield in the cross-section's web and the cross-section's rigid-plastic behaviour. Except for the largest corner radius, analytical models and finite element models give comparable results...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Dynamic {{behavior}} of <b>a</b> multiple <b>supported</b> secondary system {{mounted on a}} torsionally coupled primary system is presented for bi-directional random ground excitation, which is idealized as a broad band stationary random process. Response {{behavior of}} the multiple supported secondary system is investigated by considering and ignoring {{the interaction between the}} primary and the secondary systems. The response quantities of interest are the standard deviation of the absolute acceleration <b>at</b> <b>a</b> specified node and the bending <b>moment</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> specified <b>support</b> of the multiple supported secondary system. For the no interaction case, input to the support of the secondary system is prescribed in the form of both pseudo and cross power spectral density function (PSDF), characterizing the correlation between various supports of the multiple supported secondary system. For the interaction case, the conventional ground PSDF can directly be used as input to the combined structural system. The responses are obtained by the frequency domain spectral analysis. The responses are obtained under a number of important parametric variations. Numerical results of the study show that the responses decrease with the increase in the mass ratio between the secondary and the primary system. Under the tuned condition, a definite maxima is observed for the higher mass ratio. For strong and weak torsionally coupled primary systems under the tuned and interaction conditions the normalized acceleration show a definite minima when orientation of the secondary system is 450 with the major axes of the primary system. For the other cases, the response quantities show <b>a</b> definite maxima <b>at</b> this orientation...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{continuous}} steel bridges only exhibit composite {{behavior in}} the positive moment region. Similar composite action may also be achieved in the negative moment region by casting a bottom concrete slab between the points of inflection. Such a section {{is referred to as}} 2 ̆ 2 double composite 2 ̆ 2 since it is composite in both the positive and negative moment regions. Savings in double composite bridges arise because expensive steel is replaced by inexpensive concrete to carry compressive loads. Although double composite bridges have been designed and constructed since at least 1978 there has been limited research. Thus, current designs rely on existing provisions for designing conventional 2 ̆ 7 single 2 ̆ 7 composite bridges. This fails to fully exploit the advantages or recognize the weaknesses, if any, of double composite action. This thesis presents findings from a cooperative research project involving USF/URS/FDOT in which full-scale tests and theoretical analyses were carried to develop appropriate limit state rules for designing double composite bridges. A 4 ft. deep, 48 ft. long, 16 ft. wide box girder bridge representing the entire negative <b>moment</b> section <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>support</b> of <b>a</b> continuous full-size box girder bridge was fabricated and tested at FDOT 2 ̆ 7 s Structural Research Center, Tallahassee under fatigue, service and ultimate loading. Based on the findings from these tests and non-linear finite element analyses conducted by USF, URS proposed new design rules. This thesis focuses on the applications of these rules to develop a model design example for use by bridge engineers. The example was specifically selected from AISI so that a cost comparison with conventional design could be made. For completeness, an overview of the experimental results is also included in the thesis...|$|R
