50|$|During {{external}} sperm exchange, {{the penis}} of the donor slug is everted {{along with its}} ejaculate. The everted penis is several fold larger than its usual size, and appears as a bulbous, transparent structure. The ejaculate, an amorphous soft mass, is transferred {{onto the surface of}} the receiver slug’s everted penis. At least one species, the grey field slug (Deroceras reticulatum), shows a primitive degree of sperm packaging. The retraction of the receiver’s penis then takes the ejaculate with it. In most cases, both partners donate and receive simultaneously via intertwined penises; unilateral sperm transfer is only an occasional occurrence. Entwinement is allowed by the curvature present in slug penises; close entwinement aids successful sperm exchange, which occurs at the peak of penis eversion. When an individual of a species with external sperm transfer lacks a penis, it can still reproduce uniparenterally, such as by self-fertilisation, provided it possesses the other components of a normal reproductive system. Uniparental reproduction has been observed in the <b>marsh</b> <b>slug</b> (Deroceras laeve).|$|E

The <b>marsh</b> <b>slug</b> may be found in such habitats as forests, as well as in fields and greenhouses. The <b>marsh</b> <b>slug</b> attacks seedlings of a number of field crops, including no-tillage corn and alfalfa. It also damages lettuce, beans, and fruits such as strawberries.

40|$|Snails and slugs, {{ubiquitous}} orchid pests, can inflict a {{great deal}} of damage to virtually every part of an orchid. They wait for the cover of night to wreak their havoc. Snails and slugs, left unchecked, can infest a collection and kill your orchids fairly quickly. If you grow orchids outdoors or in a greenhouse, these pests are likely {{to be found in the}} vicinity of your growing area. Indoor growers may introduce them with a new plant, which can harbor snails, slugs or their eggs unseen in the growing medium. Snails and slugs eat mostly flowers, roots and tender new growths, although, if those are unavailable, they will consume any plant part. Because they do their damage primarily under the cover of darkness, they can be difficult to detect and eradicate. There are many different types of slugs and snails that will eat orchids; some of the more common are the orchid or bush snails (Zonitoides arboreus), the brown garden snail (Helix aspersa), the field slug (Deroceras reticulatum) and the <b>marsh</b> <b>slug</b> (Deroceras laeve). Early in the morning, you may be able to still find a snail that has been eating your flowers.

40|$|The <b>marsh</b> <b>slug</b> Deroceras laeve (Müller) (Pulmonata: Stylommatophora) was {{recently}} {{introduced into the}} southeast of the Buenos Aires Province of Argentina, and {{has become one of}} the main pests of cropping systems under no-tillage management. The growth, survival, and reproduction of D. laeve were monitored at 12 ºC and 20 ºC to determine the most appropriate thermal conditions for its development. A sigmoid model {Y = A /[1 + e (B+Cx) ]} was used to describe the relationship between postembryonic development and temperature. At the beginning of development, the growth rate was lowest at 12 ºC but after the inflection point (21 / 2 months) was lower at 20 ºC than at 12 ºC. The slugs showed a higher mean body weight at 12 ºC (936. 2 mg ± SE 18. 96) than at 20 ºC (409. 4 mg ± SE 16. 02). Significant differences were seen in the mean incubation period at the different temperatures, as well as in the hatching rate, the duration of the preoviposition and oviposition periods, the number of eggs per clutch, and longevity; no differences were seen, however, in terms of mean fecundity. The incubation period was 35. 3 and 16. 03 days and the hatching rate 89. 2 % and 66. 4 % at 12 and 20 ºC respectively. At 20 ºC, longevity was less than half (21. 9 weeks) that recorded at 12 ºC (54. 4 weeks). At both temperatures the net reproductive rate (R 0) was similar, but at 12 ºC the population increased 400 times in 33. 1 weeks (T), while at 20 ºC it increased 359 times in half that time (T = 16. 5 weeks). These results show that, in the Buenos Aires Province, D. laeve produces two generations per year...|$|E
