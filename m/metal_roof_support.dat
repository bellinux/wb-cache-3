5000|$|Overhead guard - is a <b>metal</b> <b>roof</b> <b>supported</b> by posts at {{each corner}} of the cab that helps protect the {{operator}} from any falling objects. On some forklifts, the overhead guard is an integrated part of the frame assembly.|$|R
25|$|Built {{for plant}} growing the Conservatory {{features}} {{a glass and}} <b>metal</b> <b>roof</b> <b>supported</b> by brick piers. A plaster cast of the Winged Victory of Samothrace stands at the entrance and creates a vista through the pergola. The original conservatory was demolished in 1962, and rebuilt between 2004 & 2007 {{as part of the}} restoration. The Conservatory is {{at the north end of}} the complex between the Carriage House and the Barton House.|$|R
5000|$|The three-room meeting {{house has}} a broad <b>metal</b> <b>roof,</b> <b>supported</b> by large timbers. Wide {{overhanging}} eaves create a nine-bay facade, with doorways in the even-numbered sections. [...] The flooring is made of sinker pine which was salvaged from the Trinity River and cut specifically for the meeting house. Its long submersion has given the wood a greenish tint. [...] Inside the main room, benches are arranged in a square. Above {{the center of the}} square is Turrel's Skyspace installation.|$|R
50|$|The {{front section}} {{contains}} the sheriff's office and residence. It has a hip roof and three ells. The facade, which faces southwest, has a gabled ell {{on the left}} with a stepped parapet. This forward ell {{had a pair of}} one over one light windows at each level, and there was a multi-light attic window below the parapet. There was a one-story porch that extended across the front and around the left ell. This had a <b>metal</b> <b>roof</b> <b>supported</b> by grouped wooden columns.|$|R
50|$|On the east, {{the wing}} is five bays wide. It also {{projects}} a bay {{out from the}} tower. Treatments on this wing are identical to those on the west, {{with the exception of}} the stone courses on the upper stories, all of which are plain and flush with the facade.The southeast addition is also three storys high, although not to the height of the main block. It similarly has a flat roof. The main entrance is in the third bay from the east on the six-bay southern facade. It is a modern steel and glass door sheltered by a front-gabled <b>metal</b> <b>roof</b> <b>supported</b> by two square brick pillars.|$|R
50|$|A {{wraparound}} {{porch with}} <b>metal</b> shed <b>roof</b> <b>supported</b> by round Colonial Revival columns runs {{the length of}} the south (front) and all of the west elevations. A low spindlework rail connects them. At the roofline are broad overhanging eaves supported by brackets on a molded cornice and simple frieze.|$|R
50|$|The barn has a jerkin head, V-crimp <b>metal</b> <b>roof</b> that is <b>supported</b> {{by eight}} square wooden piers and timber trusses. There is a clerestory, center ridge vent for light and ventilation. A base, {{which may have}} been for a cupola, is {{in the center of the}} ridge vent.|$|R
50|$|The club's {{first major}} honour came in guise of the Herts County Premier League title in 1969-70 and they {{repeated}} the feat in 1972-73 and 1976-77. In 1978 they rejoined the South Midlands League {{and won the}} Division One title at the first time of asking. Success continued with a Cup Final appearance in the Herts Charity Shield {{for the first time}} in 1979 and runners up spot in the South Midlands League Premier Division in 1980. The Herts Charity Shield was won in 1981-82 and two years later the club joined the Isthmian League Division Two North were they remained for six years. One of the legacies of their spell in the Isthmian League is the stand at Garden Walk, positioned mid-way along the far touchline on the cemetery side of the ground. Erected in 1984, it replaced an earlier timber structure and is constructed largely from brick with a sloping <b>metal</b> <b>roof</b> <b>supported</b> by ten posts. The official seated capacity is 300, although this is largely on benches, with only a modest number of seats provided in the central portion.|$|R
50|$|Garden Walk {{has been}} the home of Royston Town F.C. since 1932. The clubhouse and {{dressing}} rooms are behind the near goal and were constructed in 1974, while the floodlights were switched on in 1981. One of the legacies of their spell in the Isthmian League is the stand at Garden Walk, positioned mid-way along the far touchline on the cemetery side of the ground. Erected in 1984, it replaced an earlier timber structure and is constructed largely from brick with a sloping <b>metal</b> <b>roof</b> <b>supported</b> by ten posts. The official seated capacity is 300, although this is largely on benches, with only a modest number of seats provided in the central portion. Although rather hemmed in by housing, Garden Walk is certainly a better County League ground. Opportunities for development however are limited and the club have been seeking an alternative home for some time. However, {{in the spring of}} 2004 the club were rocked by the news that although they had won support at local council level, planning permission for a new ground at Ivy Farm had been turned down by the Government Office for the East of England.|$|R
5000|$|The barn is {{rectangular}} with a <b>metal</b> gable <b>roof</b> and a brick foundation. The walls up to {{the eaves}} are sawn timber. The timbers are notched at the corners and have mortar chinking. The gable ends are covered with horizontal weatherboarding. There are small rectangular doors in the gables that can be opened for ventilation. On {{the south and east}} sides, there are <b>metal</b> shed <b>roofs</b> <b>supported</b> by posts. These sheds provided shade for stringing leaves. The east and west sides have small doors at ground level. The name [...] "J. L. King" [...] and the date [...] "1942" [...] are scratched into the chinking. The barn was divided into five [...] "rooms" [...] or [...] "bents" [...] by wooden tier poles.|$|R
5000|$|The buses, {{especially}} the older MC-8 and workhorse MC-9 {{models of the}} 1980s became the standard for interstate travel for many bus companies. Those particular buses featured <b>metal</b> frames and <b>roof</b> <b>supports,</b> <b>metal</b> panels on the sides and were extremely durable and reliable. Many of the buses, having survived millions of miles of commercial use, {{have been given a}} second career serving churches or other organizations, while the MCI/TMC coaches are very popular [...] "conversion shells," [...] used for motorhomes.|$|R
5000|$|Some of the {{earliest}} visitors to the area that became Cottage City and later Oak Bluffs were Methodists, who gathered in the oak grove each summer for multi-day religious [...] "camp meetings" [...] held under large tents and in the open air. As families returned to the grove year after year, tents pitched on the ground gave way to tents pitched on wooden platforms and eventually to small wooden cottages. Small in scale and closely packed, the cottages grew more elaborate over time. Porches, balconies, elaborate door and window frames became common, as did complex wooden scrollwork affixed to the roof edges as decorative trim. The unique [...] "Carpenter's Gothic" [...] architectural style of the cottages was often accented by the owner's use of bright, multi-hue paint schemes, and gave the summer cottages a quaint, almost storybook look. Dubbed [...] "gingerbread cottages," [...] they became a tourist attraction {{in their own right}} in the late nineteenth century. So, too, did the Tabernacle: a circular, open-sided pavilion covered by a <b>metal</b> <b>roof</b> <b>supported</b> by tall wrought iron columns, erected in the late 1880s, which became a venue for services and community events. The campground's gingerbread cottages are cherished historic landmarks as well as very expensive real estate. Many are still family owned and passed on generation to generation. On April 5, 2005, the grounds and buildings in the Campground were designated a National Historic Landmark by the Secretary of the Interior.|$|R
50|$|The McGehee National Guard Armory is a {{historic}} armory building at 1610 South First Street in McGehee, Arkansas. The armory, built in 1954, is a single story cinder block building faced in brick veneer. The <b>metal</b> gable <b>roof</b> is <b>supported</b> by a steel frame, with clerestory awning windows on either side. The large central area is surrounded on three sides by single story flat-roofed sections housing offices, kitchen space, and other support areas. The design of the building is typical of those produced by the Arkansas National Guard at that time. The building {{was used by the}} National Guard until 2005, and was given to the city the following year.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "new" [...] {{house was}} built in 1887. It is a one-story double pen, central hall plan house with a <b>metal</b> <b>roof.</b> An {{overhanging}} portion of the <b>roof</b> is <b>supported</b> by four columns.|$|R
50|$|It is {{approximately}} round, {{but in fact}} is multi-sided, having 20 approximately 10 ft straight wall sections. Its <b>roof</b> was <b>supported</b> in the center by a circular scaffolding inside the barn. In 1983 the barn was about 200 ft in circumference, had white walls, and had a silver-painted corrugated <b>metal</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>Roofing</b> Systems Design Manual: The <b>Metal</b> <b>Roofing</b> Systems Design Manual is a {{comprehensive}} guide for working with <b>metal</b> <b>roofing.</b> It includes sections and chapters on roofing system components; substrate <b>support</b> for <b>metal</b> <b>roofing</b> systems; <b>metal</b> <b>roof</b> performance guide specifications; a listing of ASTM standards related to <b>metal</b> <b>roofing</b> systems; common <b>roof</b> retrofit applications; <b>metal</b> <b>roofing</b> common industry practices; design practices and examples; installation and maintenance of roofing system; roof fire ratings; fasteners, with types and applications;climatological data by U.S. County; and <b>metal</b> <b>roofing</b> AutoCAD details. The Second Edition of the <b>Metal</b> <b>Roofing</b> Systems Design Manual was published in 2012 and is up-to-date with current codes, standards and common industry practices.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the {{original}} concrete exterior walls alongside the station platforms {{and the original}} <b>roof</b> that was <b>supported</b> on concrete columns and massive cantilevered timbers were replaced with steel bents supporting a clad metal wall system and a corrugated <b>metal</b> <b>roof</b> deck.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Metal</b> <b>Roofing</b> Alliance (MRA) {{was formed}} in 1998 {{by a group of}} <b>metal</b> <b>roofing</b> {{manufacturers}} with the main goal of educating consumers about the benefits of <b>metal</b> <b>roofing.</b>|$|R
50|$|On two walls, {{usually the}} long walls, the {{dimensional}} lumber girts {{at the top}} of the walls are doubled, one on the inside and one on the outside of the posts, and usually through-bolted with large carriage bolts to <b>support</b> the <b>roof</b> load. The roof structure is frequently a truss <b>roof</b> <b>supporting</b> purlins or laths, or built using common rafters. Wide buildings with common rafters need interior rows of posts. Sometimes rafters may be attached directly to the poles. The roof pitch of pole buildings is usually low and the roof form is usually gable or lean-to. <b>Metal</b> <b>roofing</b> is commonly used as the roofing and siding material on pole buildings.|$|R
50|$|In 1954, L.J. Fisher, an {{industrialist}} from New Zealand, {{secured the}} rights to produce stone-coated <b>metal</b> <b>roofing</b> outside of Great Britain. The company he founded, AHI Roofing, operates the largest <b>metal</b> <b>roofing</b> factory in the world, and has continued to make changes to the <b>metal</b> <b>roofing</b> product.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Metal</b> <b>Roofing</b> Alliance (MRA) is a {{coalition}} comprising AISI, <b>metal</b> <b>roofing</b> manufacturers, paint suppliers and coaters, dealers, metal industry associations, and roofing contractors. Its {{mission is to}} educate consumers and contractors about the value and longevity of <b>metal</b> <b>roofing</b> for housing applications. The MRA also provides homeowners with information, resources, and contacts {{to make the most}} educated decision when re-roofing their homes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>roofs</b> {{can last}} up to 100 years, with installers {{providing}} 50 year warranties. Because of their longevity, most <b>metal</b> <b>roofs</b> are less expensive than asphalt shingles in the long term.|$|R
50|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>roofing</b> is also lightweight, {{and can be}} {{installed}} {{on top of an}} existing roof. A lightweight roof is very useful for large and or old structures, as it helps to maintain the overall structural integrity of the building. Despite its light weight, <b>metal</b> <b>roofing</b> provides increased wind resistance when compared to other roofing materials. This is because <b>metal</b> <b>roofing</b> systems use interlocking panels.|$|R
50|$|A <b>metal</b> <b>roof</b> is a roofing system {{made from}} metal pieces or tiles. It is a {{component}} of the building envelope.One of the main disadvantages of a <b>metal</b> <b>roof</b> is the noise created when it rains outside.|$|R
5000|$|As of 2016 Majic {{has started}} {{installing}} <b>metal</b> <b>roofing</b> under {{the brand name}} Michigan <b>Metal</b> <b>Roofing.</b> Majic installs <b>metal</b> tiles, shakes, and shingle all produced by Decra. Metal is the perfect material for Michigan <b>roofs,</b> because <b>metal</b> reflects heat and repels snow.|$|R
5000|$|Punta Arenas {{has been}} nicknamed [...] "the {{city of the}} red roofs" [...] for the red-painted <b>metal</b> <b>roofs</b> that {{characterized}} the city for many years. Since about 1970, the availability of other colors in protective finishes has resulted in greater variety in the characteristic <b>metal</b> <b>roofs.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Wind {{features}} a one piece <b>metal</b> <b>roof,</b> that rotates 180° backwards (much like the Ferrari 575M Superamerica), {{as opposed to}} being made of several pieces like many other <b>metal</b> <b>roof</b> convertibles. Renault claims that it takes twelve seconds to fold the roof away, which is comparable to most other convertibles.|$|R
40|$|Today’s {{headlines}} about escalating {{energy costs}} and environmental concerns are changing how builders and architects select building materials {{and how they}} design for energy performance. Since the roof can be the least energy efficient component of the building envelope, “cool roofing ” {{has come to the}} forefront. Builders and architects are now learning how advances in coatings and finishes have qualified <b>metal</b> <b>roofing</b> as a recognized “cool roofing ” product. Reflective or cool roofs can directly save up to 40 % in energy costs by lowering building envelope cooling loads. Cool <b>metal</b> <b>roofing</b> is available with several different treatments, ranging from unpainted metal to oven-baked painted finishes to granular-coated surfaces. Reflected solar energy allows the <b>metal</b> <b>roof</b> surface to remain cooler, which means less heat is transferred into the building and thus less heating load for the HVAC system. Cool <b>metal</b> <b>roofing</b> is one way to mitigate the urban heat island effect. Roofs with higher reflectance have lower surface temperatures, which help reduce ambient air temperatures. This improves air quality since less smog is formed. Also, air pollution associated with burning fossil fuels at utility plants is reduced because of less peak load demand. In addition to being energy efficient, <b>metal</b> <b>roofing</b> is a sustainable building material for several other environmental reasons. As a “green ” building product, <b>metal</b> <b>roofing</b> is rightfully becoming more popular in the architectural community...|$|R
