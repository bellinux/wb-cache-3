5|$|Jennings's <b>music</b> <b>had</b> a major {{influence}} on several neotraditionalist and alternative country artists, including Hank Williams Jr., The Marshall Tucker Band, Travis Tritt, Steve Earle, Jamey Johnson, John Anderson, his son, Shooter Jennings, Sturgill Simpson, and Hank Williams III.|$|E
5|$|The {{occurrence}} of these closures {{and the change}} in traditions is the simplest explanation of why many musicians were out of work, and why their style of <b>music</b> <b>had</b> declined before the Buena Vista Social Club made it popular again.|$|E
5|$|The overture, often {{played as}} a concert piece {{independently}} from the opera, was, unusually, composed before almost {{any of the}} other <b>music</b> <b>had</b> been written.|$|E
500|$|The film's {{original}} {{score was}} composed by Alexandre Desplat. In {{a film about}} a man struggling to articulate himself, Desplat was wary of overshadowing the dramaturgy: [...] "This is a film about {{the sound of the}} voice. <b>Music</b> <b>has</b> to deal with that. <b>Music</b> <b>has</b> to deal with silence. <b>Music</b> <b>has</b> to deal with time." ...|$|R

50|$|Macedonian's <b>music</b> <b>has</b> an {{exceptionally}} rich musical heritage. Their <b>music</b> <b>has</b> {{many things in}} common with the music of neighboring Balkan countries, but maintains its own distinctive sound.|$|R
5|$|Alex North's unused <b>music</b> <b>had</b> {{its first}} public {{appearance}} in Telarc's {{issue of the}} main theme on Hollywood's Greatest Hits, Vol. 2, a compilation album by Erich Kunzel and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra. All the music North originally wrote was recorded commercially by North's friend and colleague Jerry Goldsmith with the National Philharmonic Orchestra and was released on Varèse Sarabande CDs shortly after Telarc's first theme release but before North's death. Eventually, a mono mix-down of North's original recordings, which had survived in the interim, would be released as a limited-edition CD by Intrada Records.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{negative}} critical reception, Over the Rainbow {{has sold}} over 250,000 copies worldwide and reached {{number one in}} three countries. Since the initial album release, Talbot has performed publicly and on television in Europe, the US and across Asia, where her <b>music</b> <b>had</b> gained recognition through YouTube. Her second album, Connie Talbot's Christmas Album, was released on 24 November 2008, her third, Holiday Magic, was released on 20 October 2009 and her fourth, Beautiful World, was released on 26 November 2012.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{turbulent}} political, social and musical {{changes of the}} 1960s and early 1970s, rock music diversified. What was formerly known as rock and roll, a reasonably discrete style of <b>music,</b> <b>had</b> evolved into a catchall category called simply rock music, an umbrella term which would eventually include diverse styles like heavy metal music, punk rock and, sometimes even hip hop music. During the 1970s, however, most of these styles {{were not part of}} mainstream music, and were evolving in the underground music scene.|$|E
50|$|I Ching's <b>music</b> <b>has</b> been {{described}} has having an 80's sound, although the band often site their influences as more psychedelic and electronic based. They're <b>music</b> <b>has</b> had been heavily praised by Lauren Laverne and been {{describes as the}} changing sound of electro indie.|$|R
50|$|Métisse's <b>music</b> <b>has</b> been {{licensed}} {{for numerous}} television, film productions and advertising campaigns. They have two albums, My Fault and Nomah's Land, though their <b>music</b> <b>has</b> been licensed for several compilation discs.|$|R
5000|$|Gazpacho's <b>music</b> <b>has</b> been {{described}} by one critic as being [...] "classical post ambient nocturnal atmospheric neo-progressive folk world rock". The <b>music</b> <b>has</b> been compared to A-ha, Radiohead, Marillion and Porcupine Tree.|$|R
5|$|Gilbert had a busy autumn. His play On Guard had an {{unsuccessful}} {{run at the}} Court Theatre, opening on 28 October 1871, while his most successful play to date, Pygmalion and Galatea, opened on 9 December, {{only a few days}} before rehearsals for Thespis were to begin. Sullivan, however, had more time on his hands after a Manchester production of The Merchant of Venice, for which he supplied incidental <b>music,</b> <b>had</b> its première on 9 September.|$|E
5|$|In March 1922, Prokofiev {{moved with}} his mother {{to the town of}} Ettal in the Bavarian Alps, where for over a year he {{concentrated}} on an opera project, The Fiery Angel, based on the novel by Valery Bryusov. His later <b>music</b> <b>had</b> acquired a following in Russia, and he received invitations to return there, but decided to stay in Europe. In 1923, Prokofiev married the Spanish singer Carolina Codina (1897–1989, stage name Lina Llubera) before moving back to Paris.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Mermaid {{signaled}} the re-establishment {{of the musical}} film format as a standard for Disney animated films. The majority of Disney's most popular animated films from the 1930s on had been musicals, though by the 1970s and 1980s the role of <b>music</b> <b>had</b> been de-emphasized in the films. 1988's Oliver & Company {{had served as a}} test of sorts {{to the success of the}} musical format before Disney committed to the Broadway-style structure of The Little Mermaid.|$|E
50|$|His <b>music</b> <b>has</b> been {{reviewed}} in The New York Times and The Washington Post. His <b>music</b> <b>has</b> been {{played in the}} former Soviet Union perhaps more widely than {{that of any other}} American composer.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the band}} members {{referred}} most often to their style as experimental <b>music,</b> their <b>music</b> <b>has</b> been characterized as free jazz, and as punk jazz. Their <b>music</b> <b>has</b> also been {{compared to that of}} Frank Zappa.|$|R
50|$|In the 20th century, western style {{classical}} <b>music</b> <b>has</b> been introduced, {{and mixed}} with traditional elements by some composers. Later {{on the full}} palette of Pop and Rock <b>music</b> <b>has</b> also been adopted by younger musicians.|$|R
5|$|The episode closes {{with music}} from The Avengers. After the <b>music</b> <b>had</b> been recorded, Scully {{felt that it}} did not suit the ending and so wished to change it to {{something}} else. However, it was too late in production to get the full orchestra back to do a recording, and union rules meant that previous recordings could not be reused.|$|E
5|$|The film {{became a}} box office success, {{grossing}} $23,002,182 worldwide. Critics were generally {{enthusiastic about the}} story and especially the music, although leading U.S. film critic Roger Ebert and the British Film Institute's Peter Curran felt that Wenders had lingered too long on Cooder during the performances; and the editing, which interspersed interviews with <b>music,</b> <b>had</b> disrupted {{the continuity of the}} songs. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for best documentary feature in 1999. It won best documentary at the European Film Awards and received seventeen other major accolades internationally.|$|E
5|$|The {{music was}} {{credited}} to Trevor Duncan, a pseudonym used by BBC radio producer Leonard Trebilco, whose music {{was obtained from}} stock discs. Quatermass and the Pit also used sound effects and electronic music to create a disturbing atmosphere. These tracks were created for the serial by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, overseen by Desmond Briscoe; Quatermass and the Pit {{was one of the}} productions for which Briscoe and the workshop became most renowned. It was the first time electronic <b>music</b> <b>had</b> been used in a science-fiction television production.|$|E
50|$|Her <b>music</b> <b>has</b> been {{performed}} by ensembles {{across the world}} including the Wigmore Hall London, Tokyo Opera City Concert Hall in Japan and the Jordan Hall, Boston USA. Her <b>music</b> <b>has</b> {{been performed}} at the BBC Proms.|$|R
50|$|The Federalists' <b>music</b> <b>has</b> been {{inspired}} by {{a wide variety of}} artists and styles, including Wilco, Bob Dylan and The Beatles. Their <b>music</b> <b>has</b> been called everything from indie to classic rock, alt. country, and classic pop.|$|R
50|$|The band's <b>music</b> <b>has</b> {{appeared}} on television, with appearances on NBC, including Mercy and The Philanthropist. More recently, the band's <b>music</b> <b>has</b> been licensed {{for use in}} a television commercial, airing in Mexico, for Converse (shoe company).|$|R
5|$|To {{give the}} series its own {{distinctive}} musical identity, according to Djawadi, the producers asked {{him not to}} use musical elements such as flutes or solo vocals {{that had already been}} successfully used by other major fantasy productions. He mentioned that a challenge in scoring the series was its reliance on dialogue and its sprawling cast: on several occasions already-scored <b>music</b> <b>had</b> to be omitted so as not {{to get in the way}} of dialogue.|$|E
5|$|A few {{recent works}} {{have become a}} part of the modern repertoire, {{including}} scores and theatrical works by composers such as Luciano Berio, Luigi Nono, Franco Donatoni, and Sylvano Bussotti. These composers are not part of a distinct school or tradition, though they do share certain techniques and influences. By the 1970s, avant-garde classical <b>music</b> <b>had</b> become linked to the Italian Communist Party, while a revival of popular interest continued into the next decade, with foundations, festivals and organization created to promote modern music. Near the end of the 20th century, government sponsorship of musical institutions began to decline, and several RAI choirs and city orchestras were closed. Despite this, a number of composers gained international reputations in the early 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Already as a teenager, Sorabji {{took great}} {{interest}} in recent developments in art music—in the work of Schoenberg, Scriabin, Mahler and Debussy, among others—at {{a time when they}} received scant attention in the United Kingdom. This interest, along with his ethnicity, cemented his reputation as an outsider. He and his <b>music</b> <b>had</b> their detractors, but some musicians received his work positively: Frederick Delius, who heard a 1930 radio broadcast of Sorabji playing his own piece Le jardin parfumé: Poem for Piano Solo, sent a letter of admiration to Sorabji; the French–Swiss pianist Alfred Cortot expressed interest in performing Sorabji's piano concertos; and Alban Berg reportedly took an interest in Sorabji's music.|$|E
50|$|Fan-funded <b>music</b> <b>has</b> become {{increasingly}} popular, but {{the platform is}} young and not fully developed. Fan-funded <b>music</b> <b>has</b> {{a long way to}} go before it can be used as a sole source of funding for an artist's career.|$|R
50|$|Envy's <b>music</b> <b>has</b> {{appeared}} on numerous movie soundtracks, including A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas, Lottery Ticket, and Piranha 3D. His <b>music</b> <b>has</b> also {{appeared on}} E!'s Kourtney and Kim Take Miami, MTV's The Hills and VH1's Basketball Wives.|$|R
40|$|In many holy {{stories in}} the Old Testament and also the New Testament, {{there are a great}} deal of episodes of music. These episodes are not only {{historically}} interesting but also tell us the fact that <b>music</b> <b>has</b> some power of treatment for psychological symptoms, which gives us hints for music therapy and therapists. European <b>music</b> <b>has</b> been developed by Christianism, and Christianism raised music to Art. Suported by the Arts, <b>music</b> <b>has</b> power for human spirit...|$|R
5|$|As a term, neo {{soul was}} coined by Kedar Massenburg of Motown Records {{in the late}} 1990s as a {{marketing}} category following the commercial breakthroughs of artists such as D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, and Maxwell. The success of D'Angelo's 1995 debut album Brown Sugar has been regarded by several writers and music critics as inspiration behind the term's origin. While some artists have ignored the label, others have received the designation with controversy because it may seem contrived to music audiences and imply that soul <b>music</b> <b>had</b> ended {{at some point in}} time. In a 2002 interview for Billboard, Massenburg said that genre classifications are often unpopular because they may be suggestive of a short-lived trend. However, although he said neo soul is still essentially soul music, Massenburg felt there was a need to market artists of the genre for listeners to have an understanding of what they were buying.|$|E
5|$|At Sony Music Entertainment, Kutaragi {{worked closely}} with Shigeo Maruyama, the CEO of Sony Music, and with Akira Sato to form Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. (SCEI) on November 16, 1993. A {{building}} block of SCEI was its initial partnership with Sony Music which helped SCEI attract creative talent to the company as well as assist SCEI in manufacturing, marketing and producing discs, something that Sony <b>Music</b> <b>had</b> been doing with Music Discs. The final two key members of SCEI were Terry Tokunaka, the President of SCEI from Sony's headquarters, and Olaf Olafsson. Olafsson was CEO and president of New York-based Sony Interactive Entertainment which was the mother company for the 1994-founded Sony Computer Entertainment of America (SCEA).|$|E
5|$|Bache {{had long}} {{cherished}} the wish of bringing Liszt to London, which Liszt had last visited in 1841 while still a touring virtuoso, and Liszt knew that whatever standing his <b>music</b> <b>had</b> {{in that city}} had {{in large part to}} do with Bache's efforts. At least in part to repay the debt he felt he owed Bache, Liszt accepted Bache's invitation to attend celebrations in April 1886 to commemorate Liszt's 75th birthday. These celebrations included the foundation of a Liszt piano scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music, a performance of his oratorio The Legend of Saint Elizabeth led by Alexander Mackenzie in St. James's Hall, an audience with Queen Victoria and a public reception in Liszt's honour at the Grosvenor Gallery. Bache was involved in all four of these events, which were highly successful; by popular demand, Saint Elizabeth had to be repeated at the Crystal Palace.|$|E

Byrds <b>music</b> <b>has</b> had a lasting {{influence}} on numerous soul, R&B, and hip hop artists.|$|R
