40|$|Abstract: In a {{real-time}} indoor place recognition system using {{image features}} detection, specific markers included in input image should be detected exactly and quickly. However {{because the same}} markers in image are shown up differently depending to movement, direction and angle of camera, it is required a method to solve such problems. This paper proposes a technique to extract the features of object without regard to change of the object scale. To support real-time operation, it adopts SURF(Speeded up Robust Features) which enables fast feature detection. Another feature of this system is the user <b>mark</b> <b>designation</b> which makes possible for user to designate marks from input image for location detection in advance. Unlike to use hardware marks, the feature above has an advantage that the designated mark...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to analyse {{different}} instruments of defence against trade mark piracy. The thesis composes of seven chapters. Chapter One is introductory and defines basic terminology used in the thesis: trade mark, community trade mark, registration of the trade mark by the Industrial Property Office, etc. Chapter Two focuses on the term "trade mark piracy". It divides defence against it into two different means [...] dispute proceedings by the Industrial Property Office and judicial instruments. Chapter Three concentrates on comments on the ineligibility for enrolment of the trade <b>mark</b> <b>designation</b> and reasons for taking these comments. The chapter Four analyzes different types of the proposal for the revocation of the trade mark [...] nonusage and using the trade mark {{in conflict with the}} unfair competition regulation. The chapter Five looks at the declaration of already-registered trade marks as invalid. Different reasons for taking a proposal of declaration are examined there. The chapter Six describes different types of appeals against decisions of the Industrial Property Office. The last chapter summarizes results of the questionary about use of the instruments against trade mark piracy...|$|E
