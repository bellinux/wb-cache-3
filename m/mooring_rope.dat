5|$|Zorin, who {{had escaped}} in his airship with Scarpine and Mortner, abducts Sutton, but Bond {{grabs hold of}} the airship's <b>mooring</b> <b>rope.</b> Zorin tries to knock Bond off the rope, but Bond manages to moor the airship to the {{framework}} of the Golden Gate Bridge. Sutton attacks Zorin, and in the fracas, Mortner and Scarpine are temporarily knocked out. Sutton flees and joins Bond out on the bridge, but Zorin pursues them with an axe. The ensuing fight between Zorin and Bond culminates with Zorin falling to his death in the waters of San Francisco Bay. An enraged Mortner attacks Bond using sticks of dynamite, but Bond cuts the airship cable free, which causes Mortner to drop the dynamite in the cabin. The dynamite explodes, killing Mortner and Scarpine and destroying the airship. General Gogol awards Bond the Order of Lenin for foiling Zorin's strategy. Afterwards, Bond and Sutton make love in the shower of the Sutton home.|$|E

60|$|Nobody hailed him, {{and he went}} {{on until}} he came {{opposite}} a small marque. She had no lights, but as he stole by his foot struck a <b>mooring</b> <b>rope</b> and he fell. He lay flat on the ground for some moments, and then, hearing no movement on board, got up and crept away, looking out for the next rope. The mole was long and he had not gone far when he heard the splash of oars. A boat came out of the dark, and a break in the wall indicated a row of steps. Marston did not want to turn back, and it was possible the men were going to one of the vessels. If they were going to the town, he had better get past the steps before they landed. A pile of goods forced him to leave the gloom of the parapet and it looked as if his figure cut against the sky, for the splash of oars stopped.|$|E

The distance between London Bridge and Deptford was traversed in a very short time. A vessel with her flags flying and her canvas already loosened was hanging to a buoy some distance out in the stream, and as the boat came near enough for the captain to distinguish those on board, the <b>mooring</b> <b>rope</b> was slipped, the head sails flattened in, and the vessel began to swing round. Before her head was down stream the boat was alongside. The two officers followed by the boys ascended the ladder by the side. The luggage was quickly handed up, and the servitors followed. The sails were sheeted home, and the vessel began to move rapidly through the water.|$|E

These AE types are related to different stages of rope behaviour, from bedding-in to degradation and failure.

Taking that morning's sailing from Liverpool to Douglas, Tynwald experienced great difficulty trying to berth at the King Edward VIII Pier, and suffered damage to the belting on her starboard side, over a distance of approximately five metres, as well as suffering damage to her plating.Finally she secured alongside and having discharged her passengers and mail, Tynwald departed for Liverpool at 15:50hrs taking the passengers and mail which should have left on Fenella's morning sailing, which had been cancelled due to her incident with the <b>mooring</b> <b>rope.</b>|$|E

50|$|Sutton {{climbs out}} of the mine through an upright shaft and is lifted by Zorin onto the airship. Bond grabs a <b>mooring</b> <b>rope</b> and clings to it as the airship heads for the Golden Gate Bridge. Zorin {{attempts}} to kill Bond by flying against bridge, but Bond anchors the ship to the bridge's framework, trapping it. Sutton knocks out Scarpine, hits Glaub, and tumbles out of the airship. Bond grabs her hand and she is able to gain footing on the framework under him. Zorin jumps onto the framework with an ax and swings at Bond, but he eventually loses his balance and falls off the bridge to his death. Glaub attempts to avenge Zorin by throwing lit dynamite at Bond and Sutton, but before he can take aim, Bond cuts the <b>mooring</b> <b>rope</b> with Zorin's ax. The airship, still under power, lurches upward and the sudden motion causes Glaub and the explosives to fall backwards into the cabin. Glaub and Scarpine fumble in a panic but are unable to toss the dynamite and are killed. Sutton and Bond are safe from the explosion.|$|E

As a distracted Josh reaches for the tape, Tammi quickly throws the looped end of the <b>mooring</b> <b>rope</b> around his neck. The rope immediately reaches the end of its tether and Josh is wrenched into the sea, snapping his neck and killing him. Tammi, now the sole survivor, fires a distress flare in the hope of being rescued. She then lies down on the tender and morbidly stares up at the night sky, as the raft drifts away into the ocean.|$|E

Chris wants to know why they cannot avoid the disaster as Stewie tries to find a way to cover up the part of not altering the past. Before Stewie, Brian, and Chris can return to the present, the ship strikes the iceberg and the return pad is destroyed by the rushing water. They find they need to get it to dry land to repair it. Dressing as women, they head for the lifeboats, but find they are too late. This causes Chris to force room for them all in the last boat by throwing a crew member overboard where he comments that he can't swim without his striped one-piece.
