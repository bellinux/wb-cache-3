5000|$|Felsenstein was {{influenced}} in his philosophy by {{the works of}} Ivan Illich, particularly Tools for Conviviality (Harper and Row, 1973). This book advocated a [...] "convivial" [...] approach to design which allowed users of technologies {{to learn about the}} technology by encouraging exploration, tinkering, and modification. Felsenstein had learned about electronics in much the same fashion, and summarized his conclusions in several aphorisms, to wit - [...] "In order to survive in a public-access environment, a computer must grow a computer club around itself." [...] Others were - [...] "To change the rules, change the tools," [...] and [...] "If work is to become play, then tools must become toys."Felsenstein was one of the original members of the Homebrew Computer Club, which formed in 1975 in response to the appearance of the Altair 8800 computer kit.

40|$|Light is a {{propagation}} of electromagnetic waves that spread all directions that {{play an important}} role in everyday life because it is an absolute part of life and without the light of life on earth can not develop. The amount of light illuminance is necessary to know because basically humans require adequate lighting. The instrument for measuring light illuminance is a luxmeter or light meter. However, this gauge is difficult to obtain and the price of the tool is expensive so that it can only be found in certain school laboratories or colleges. While telemetry is the process of measuring the parameters of an object (objects, space, natural conditions) that the measurement results are transmitted to other places via data transmission without or using a cable (wireless). The purpose of this study is to measure, to know the conditions of light intensity. This research uses experimental model of light intensity measurement using independent measuring instrument with combination of LDR and Arduino uno consisting of transmitter and receiver. In the transmitter there are LDR, Arduino Uno, and RF <b>Module</b> <b>Board</b> 433 MHz components, while the receiver consists of Arduino Uno, laptop, and RF <b>Module</b> <b>Board</b> 433 MHz.

As an example we have chosen the problem of enumerating closed two-dimensional random paths. An Evaluation <b>Module</b> <b>Board</b> (EVM) for TMS 320 C 6201 fixed-point processor is used. The algorithm is implemented in hand-written parallel assembly language. Some techniques are used to fit the algorithm to the parallel structure of the processor and also to avoid Branch and Condition-Checking tasks. Common optimization methods are also employed to improve the execution speed of the code. These methods are shown to yield a good efficiency in using the maximum computation power of the processor. We use these results to obtain the area distribution of the paths. Comment: 5 pages, Pdf, two table...|$|E
40|$|Soft errors due to cosmic {{particles}} are a growing reliability threat for VLSI systems. In this paper we analyze the soft error vulnerability of FPGAs used in storage systems. Since the reliability requirements of these high performance storage subsystems are very stringent, {{the reliability of}} the FPGA chips used in the design of such systems plays a critical role in the overall system reliability. We validate the projections produced by our analytical model by using field error rates obtained from actual field failure data of a large FPGA-based design used in the Logical Unit <b>Module</b> <b>board</b> of a commercial storage system. This comparison confirms that the projections obtained from our analytical tool are accurate (there is an 81 % overlap in FIT rate range obtained with our analytical modeling framework and the field failure data studied). ...|$|E

40|$|The {{demand for}} faster, {{portable}} and reliable electronic devices is increasing {{the pressure on}} the development of assembly techniques for signal integrity (SI). The advance of integrated circuits toward a large number of Input/Output (I/Os), a high number of operations and up to microwave communication frequencies, is behind the drive for the search for new packaging solutions. The materials and assembly techniques have an important impact on the propagation of high speed signals. Signal integrity issues emerge due to the electrical losses of materials, reflections from impedance discontinuities in the signal path and fast transitions of the signals. For these reasons, signal integrity in lead-free connections of WLCSP, flip chip (FC) and Integrated <b>Module</b> <b>Board</b> (IMB) assemblies were investigated up to 50  GHz. The increase of conductor loss resulting from the presence of thick oxide layers on the surface of solder bumps of hot running components was experimentally studied for the first time. Utilizing theoretical calculations, a design rule was developed to account for the 40  % increase in losses due to the presence of oxide layers at high frequencies. The research into the influence of solder microstructure on signal quality showed that it did not negatively affect the wave propagation. Experimental results proved that the presence of underfills and high density routing on printed wiring boards (PWBs) under the WLCSP components, detuned the components and the connections. The effects of three different underfills on signal propagation were studied. It was proven that the changes resulting from the rheology and parameters of curing process influence the losses and reflections of circuits. The analysis of microwave performances of flip chip (FC) and Integrated <b>Module</b> <b>Board</b> (IMB) assembly techniques demonstrated that they are well suited to Radio frequency (RF) and high speed applications. Comparison showed that IMB performed better as the wave encountered smaller discontinuities and had an optimized propagation path. Full wave simulations of IMB assemblies were performed considering finite ground coplanar waveguide (FGCPW), microstrip and stripline connections with stack-ups that included high dielectric constant materials and four connection possibilities. The research was carried out in the domains of both frequency and time to rigorously determine the sources of signal reflections. The results emphasized that in the design for match impedance and optimal current return path, discontinuities and reference planes had significant impact on signal integrity...|$|E
