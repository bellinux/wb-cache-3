5|$|Liquid {{acetic acid}} is a {{hydrophilic}} (polar) protic solvent, similar to ethanol and water. With a moderate relative static permittivity (dielectric constant) of 6.2, it dissolves not only polar compounds such as inorganic salts and sugars, but also non-polar compounds such as oils {{as well as}} polar solutes. It is miscible with polar and non-polar solvents such as water, chloroform, and hexane. With higher alkanes (starting with octane), acetic acid is not completely miscible, and its <b>miscibility</b> declines with longer n-alkanes. The solvent and <b>miscibility</b> properties of acetic acid make it a useful industrial chemical, for example, as a solvent {{in the production of}} dimethyl terephthalate.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol's <b>miscibility</b> {{with water}} {{contrasts}} with the immiscibility of longer-chain alcohols (five or more carbon atoms), whose water <b>miscibility</b> decreases sharply {{as the number of}} carbons increases. The <b>miscibility</b> of ethanol with alkanes is limited to alkanes up to undecane: mixtures with dodecane and higher alkanes show a <b>miscibility</b> gap below a certain temperature (about 13°C for dodecane). The <b>miscibility</b> gap tends to get wider with higher alkanes and the temperature for complete <b>miscibility</b> increases.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol's high <b>miscibility</b> {{with water}} makes it {{unsuitable}} for shipping through modern pipelines like liquid hydrocarbons. Mechanics have seen increased cases {{of damage to}} small engines (in particular, the carburetor) and attribute {{the damage to the}} increased water retention by ethanol in fuel.|$|E
25|$|Well known fitted {{equations}} for solubility prediction are {{the general}} solubility equations. These equations {{stem from the}} work of Yalkowsky et al. The original formula is given first followed by a revised formula which takes a different assumption of complete <b>miscibility</b> in octanol. These equations a founded on the principles of the fusion cycle.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol is hygroscopic, {{meaning it}} absorbs water vapor {{directly}} from the atmosphere. Because absorbed water dilutes the fuel value of the ethanol and may cause phase separation of ethanol-gasoline blends (which causes engine stall), containers of ethanol fuels must be kept tightly sealed. This high <b>miscibility</b> with water means that ethanol cannot be efficiently shipped through modern pipelines, like liquid hydrocarbons, over long distances.|$|E
25|$|In the laboratory, THF is {{a popular}} solvent when its water <b>miscibility</b> is not an issue. It is more basic than diethyl ether and forms {{stronger}} complexes with Li+, Mg2+, and boranes. It {{is a popular}} solvent for hydroboration reactions and for organometallic compounds such as organolithium and Grignard reagents. Although similar to diethyl ether, THF is a stronger base. Thus, while diethyl ether remains the solvent of choice for some reactions (e.g., Grignard reactions), THF fills that role in many others, where strong coordination is desirable and the precise properties of ethereal solvents such as these (alone and in mixtures and at various temperatures) allows fine-tuning modern chemical reactions.|$|E
25|$|Ionic liquids {{are often}} {{moderate}} to poor conductors of electricity, non-ionizing (e.g., non-polar), highly viscous and frequently exhibit low vapor pressure. Their other properties are diverse: many have low combustibility, are thermally stable, with wide liquid regions, and favorable solvating properties {{for a range}} of polar and non-polar compounds. Many classes of chemical reactions, such as Diels-Alder reactions and Friedel-Crafts reactions, can be performed using ionic liquids as solvents. IL's can serve as solvents for biocatalysis. The <b>miscibility</b> of ionic liquids with water or organic solvents varies with side chain lengths on the cation and with choice of anion. They can be functionalized to act as acids, bases, or ligands, and are precursors salts in the preparation of stable carbenes. They have recently been found to hydrolyse, affording acidic or basic media in the aqueous milieu. Because of their distinctive properties, ionic liquids are attracting increasing attention in many fields, including organic chemistry, electrochemistry, catalysis, physical chemistry, and engineering; see for instance magnetic ionic liquid.|$|E
2500|$|If the {{constituents}} of a mixture {{are not completely}} miscible, an azeotrope can be found inside the <b>miscibility</b> gap. This type of azeotrope is called heterogeneous azeotrope. If the azeotropic composition is outside the <b>miscibility</b> gap or {{the constituents}} of the mixture are completely miscible, the type of azeotrope is called a homogeneous azeotrope. [...] A heteroazeotropic distillation (see heteroazeotrope) will have two liquid phases.|$|E
2500|$|... 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF) {{has been}} {{promoted}} as a more ecologically-friendly alternative to THF. Whereas 2-MeTHF is more expensive, it may provide for greater overall process economy. 2-MeTHF has solvating properties that are intermediate between diethyl ether and THF, has limited water <b>miscibility,</b> and forms an azeotrope with water on distillation. Its lower melting point makes it useful for lower temperature reactions, and its higher boiling point allows procedures under reflux at higher temperatures (relative to THF).|$|E
6000|$|... 558. Water makes a pole of {{difficult}} application, {{except in a}} few cases (494.), because of its small conducting power, its <b>miscibility</b> with most of the substances acted upon, and its general relation to them in respect to chemical affinity. It consists of elements, which in their electrical and chemical relations are directly and powerfully opposed, yet combining to produce a body more neutral in its character than any other. So that there are but few substances which do not come into relation, by chemical affinity, with water or one of its elements; and therefore either the water or its elements are transferred and assist in transferring the infinite variety of bodies which, in association with it, can be placed {{in the course of the}} electric current. Hence the reason why it so rarely happens that the evolved substances rest at the first surface of the water, and why it therefore does not exhibit the ordinary action of a pole.|$|E
6000|$|... 628. A {{third and}} very {{important}} consideration {{in favour of}} the mutual action of gases under these circumstances is their perfect <b>miscibility.</b> If fluid bodies capable of combining together are also capable of mixture, they do combine when they are mingled, not waiting for any other determining circumstance; but if two such gases as oxygen and hydrogen are put together, though they are elements having such powerful affinity as to unite naturally under a thousand different circumstances, they do not combine by mere mixture. Still it is evident that, from their perfect association, the particles are in the most favourable state possible for combination upon the supervention of any determining cause, such either as the negative action of the platina in suppressing or annihilating, as it were, their elasticity on its side; or the positive action of the metal in condensing them against its surface by an attractive force; or the influence of both together.|$|E
