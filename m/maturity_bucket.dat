40|$|This thesis first {{examines}} the one-year rating migration behavior of Canadian corporate debt issuers rated by Standard and Poor's between January 1981 and December 2001. Obligors {{are sorted into}} three industry groups [...] financials, industrials and utilities. The studied period is divided between years of expansion and recession. The corresponding conditional rating migration patterns are compared with unconditional estimates {{in order to assess}} the reliability of the latter, which are traditionally used to evaluate credit risk. Our unconditional results show that the average credit quality of Canadian corporate obligors has deteriorated over the studied period, in particular during the 1981 - 1982 and 1990 - 1992 recession years. On average, issuers in the industrials sector underwent the deepest credit quality deterioration and highest rating activity ratio. Furthermore, we find that industry- and economy-conditioned rating migration dynamics significantly differ from their unconditional estimates. However, the one-year rating transition matrix is weakly influenced by the stage in the business cycle or by the obligor's industry. Secondly, we compare the performance for Canadian corporate bonds between February 1993 and May 2002. We find that the term structure of interest rates is a major determinant of bond returns regardless of the bond rating class, <b>maturity</b> <b>bucket</b> or industry. Finally, we show that the total volatility of Canadian corporate bonds has slightly decreased over the 1993 to 2002 period. Following Campbell, Lettau, Malkiel and Xu (2001), we examine the market, industry and firm-specific volatility components of bond returns. We find that the relative and absolute levels of market volatility remain fairly low and steady over the sample period. However, the relative level of firm-specific volatility has sharply increased. Simultaneously, the industry volatility level has decreased. Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests provide no evidence of deterministic trends in these volatility components...|$|E

40|$|Several {{principal}} component models of volatility smiles and skews {{have been based}} on daily changes in implied volatilities, by strike and/or by moneyness. Derman and Kamal (1997) analyze S&P 500 and Nikkei 225 index options where the daily change in the volatility surface is specified by delta and maturity. Skiadopoulos, Hodges and Clewlow (1998) apply PCA to first differences of implied volatilities for fixed <b>maturity</b> <b>buckets,</b> across both strike and moneyness metrics. And Fengler et. al. (2000) employ a common PCA that allows options on equities in the DAX of different maturities to be analyzed simultaneously. ...|$|R
25|$|Contemporary bank {{management}} {{methods for}} liquidity {{are based on}} maturity analysis of all the bank's assets and liabilities (off balance sheet exposures may also be included). Assets and liabilities are put into residual contractual <b>maturity</b> <b>buckets</b> such as 'on demand', 'less than 1 month', '2â€“3 months' etc. These residual contractual maturities may be adjusted to account for expected counter party behaviour such as early loan repayments due to borrowers refinancing and expected renewals of term deposits to give forecast cash flows. This analysis highlights any large future net outflows of cash and enables the bank to respond before they occur. Scenario analysis may also be conducted, depicting scenarios including stress scenarios such as a bank-specific crisis.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} HJM {{approach}} to the projection of multiple yield curves developed to capture the volatility content of historical term structures for risk management purposes. Since we observe the empirical data at daily frequency and only for {{a finite number of}} time to <b>maturity</b> <b>buckets,</b> we propose a modelling framework which is inherently discrete. In particular, we show how to approximate the HJM continuous time description of the multi-curve dynamics by a Vector Autoregressive process of order one. The resulting dynamics lends itself to a feasible estimation of the model volatility-correlation structure. Then, resorting to the Principal Component Analysis we further simplify the dynamics reducing the number of covariance components. Applying the constant volatility version of our model on a sample of curves from the Euro area, we demonstrate its forecasting ability through an out-of-sample test...|$|R
