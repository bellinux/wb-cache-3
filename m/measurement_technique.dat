25|$|Multimodal imaging {{frequently}} {{consists of}} the coupling of an electrophysiologic <b>measurement</b> <b>technique,</b> such as EEG or MEG, with a hemodynamic one such as fMRI or PET. While the intention {{is to use the}} strengths and limitations of each to complement the other, current approaches suffer from experimental limitations. Some previous work has focused on attempting to use the high spatial resolution of fMRI to determine the (spatial) origin of EEG/MEG signals, so that in future work this spatial information could be extracted from a unimodal EEG/MEG signal. While some studies have seen success in correlating signal origins between modalities to within a few millimeters, the results have not been uniformly positive. Another current limitation is the actual experimental setup: taking measurements using both modalities at once yields inferior signals, but the alternative of measuring each modality separately is confounded by trial-to-trial variability.|$|E

2500|$|Fourier {{transform}} infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a <b>measurement</b> <b>technique</b> {{that allows}} one to record infrared spectra. [...] Infrared light is guided through an interferometer and then through the sample (or vice versa). [...] A moving mirror inside the apparatus alters the distribution of infrared light that passes through the interferometer. The signal directly recorded, called an [...] "interferogram", represents light output {{as a function of}} mirror position. A data-processing technique called Fourier transform turns this raw data into the desired result (the sample's spectrum): Light output as a function of infrared wavelength (or equivalently, wavenumber). As described above, the sample's spectrum is always compared to a reference.|$|E
2500|$|CERTO - Coherent Electromagnetic Radio Tomography Experiment (1996-18/NRL) instrumentation, {{developed}} by NRL's Plasma Physics Division, {{consists of a}} stable radio beacon transmitter on the satellite and a chain of receivers on the ground. Radio transmissions from the CERTO beacon are processed by the ground receivers to produce two-dimensional maps of the electron densities in the ionosphere. The CERTO <b>measurement</b> <b>technique</b> provides images of the ionosphere with 10km vertical and horizontal resolution. In addition, ionospheric irregularities of 1km or less in size can be determined by fluctuations in the CERTO radio waves. [...] CERTO {{can also be used}} to calibrate the ionospheric densities obtained using the EUV instruments such as HIRAAS, GIMI, and EUVIP on ARGOS. The CERTO radio-based technique has the advantage of higher spatial resolution than provided by the EUV-based techniques, but requires ground-based receivers aligned under the satellite orbit. The two techniques together on the same satellite provide substantial improvements over each technique separately. CERTO principal investigator, Dr. Paul Bernhardt notes that the NRL instruments on ARGOS will be the first demonstration combining EUV and radio sensors for enhanced imaging of the ionosphere.|$|E
2500|$|A {{frequency}} response diagram plots the microphone sensitivity in decibels over {{a range of}} frequencies (typically 20Hz to 20kHz), generally for perfectly on-axis sound (sound arriving at 0° to the capsule). Frequency response may be less informatively stated textually like so: [...] "30Hz–16kHz±3dB". This is interpreted as meaning a nearly flat, linear, plot between the stated frequencies, with variations in amplitude {{of no more than}} plus or minus 3dB. However, one cannot determine from this information how smooth the variations are, nor in what parts of the spectrum they occur. Note that commonly made statements such as [...] "20Hz–20kHz" [...] are meaningless without a decibel measure of tolerance. Directional microphones' {{frequency response}} varies greatly with distance from the sound source, and with the geometry of the sound source. IEC60268-4 specifies that frequency response should be measured in plane progressive wave conditions (very far away from the source) but this is seldom practical. Close talking microphones may be measured with different sound sources and distances, but there is no standard and therefore no way to compare data from different models unless the <b>measurement</b> <b>technique</b> is described.|$|E

2500|$|To {{determine}} {{mass balance}} in the accumulation zone, snowpack depth is measured using probing, snowpits or crevasse stratigraphy. Crevasse stratigraphy makes use of annual layers revealed {{on the wall of}} a crevasse. Akin to tree rings, these layers are due to summer dust deposition and other seasonal effects. The advantage of crevasse stratigraphy is that it provides a two-dimensional measurement of the snowpack layer, not a point measurement. [...] It is also usable in depths where probing or snowpits are not feasible. In temperate glaciers, the insertion resistance of a probe increases abruptly when its tip reaches ice that was formed the previous year. The probe depth {{is a measure of the}} net accumulation above that layer. Snowpits dug through the past winters residual snowpack are used to determine the snowpack depth and density. [...] The snowpack's mass balance is the product of density and depth. Regardless of depth <b>measurement</b> <b>technique</b> the observed depth is multiplied by the snowpack density to determine the accumulation in water equivalent. It is necessary to measure the density in the spring as snowpack density varies. [...] Measurement of snowpack density completed at the end of the ablation season yield consistent values for a particular area on temperate alpine glaciers and need not be measured every year. In the ablation zone, ablation measurements are made using stakes inserted vertically into the glacier either at the end of the previous melt season or the beginning of the current one. The length of stake exposed by melting ice is measured at the end of the melt (ablation) season. Most stakes must be replaced each year or even midway through the summer.|$|E
