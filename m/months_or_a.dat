However, in a number of landmark cases, the higher courts dismissed assertions that kissing in public is obscene.|$|E

Emily had a visceral need {{of her home}} and the countryside that surrounded it, and to leave it would cause her to languish and wither. Charlotte and Anne, being more realistic, did not hesitate in finding work and from April 1839 to December 1841 the two sisters had several posts as governesses. Not staying long with each family, their employment would last for some <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> single season. However, Anne did stay with the Robinsons in Thorp Green where things went well, from May 1840 to June 1845.|$|E

500|$|The State Election Committee {{defined the}} polling stations's {{appearance}} and their immediate surroundings up to [...] away, prohibiting campaigning and displaying of promotional materials there as with elections in Croatia. Unlike Croatian elections, {{there is no}} mandatory halt to campaigning before a referendum. GONG appointed approximately 300 observers to monitor the referendum voting. The Election Committee {{announced that it would}} start publishing voting results on its web site two hours after the polling stations in Croatia closed, and it would expect to determine the referendum's outcome by midnight. If a proposed question was supported by a simple majority of those voting, the proposal would be considered passed and the result binding on the Croatian Parliament pursuant to §87, paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Croatian Constitution. Since the referendum passed, the Croatian Parliament was required to ratify the Croatian EU accession treaty. Amendments (from 2010) to the constitution provide that referendums are valid regardless of actual turnout. If the referendum proposal were to have failed, it could have been repeated in six <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> year. It is estimated that a referendum rejection would have cost Croatia approximately €1.6billion in lost EU funding until 2014.|$|E

500|$|In April 1957 Boris Ford, Head of Schools Broadcasting at Associated Rediffusion (A-R), {{wrote to}} Britten, proposing {{a series of}} half-hour programmes. These would show Britten {{composing}} and rehearsing a work through to its performance, and would provide children with [...] "an intimate piece of musical education, by... watching {{a piece of music}} take shape and in some degree growing with it". Britten was initially cautious; he found the idea interesting but, he warned Ford, he was at that time [...] busy [...] travelling, and had little time for writing. He was also anxious not to cover the same ground as he had with Let's Make an Opera. However, he agreed to meet Ford [...] to discuss the project further. On 11 July they met in London, together with Britten's musical assistant Imogen Holst. Britten told Ford that he had [...] "for some <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> year vaguely been thinking of doing something with the [...] miracle plays", and agreed to write an opera for A-R's 1958 summer term of school programmes. The subject would be Noah and the flood, based on the Chester text. Later, Ford and his script editor, Martin Worth, travelled to Aldeburgh, and with Britten looked at possible churches for the performance. The Church of St Bartholomew, Orford, was chosen as, unlike most other churches in East Suffolk, its pews were not fixed, thus offering a more flexible performing space.|$|E
