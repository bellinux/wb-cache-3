5|$|For decades, the {{commercial}} technology for separating tantalum from niobium involved the fractional crystallization of potassium heptafluorotantalate away from potassium oxypentafluoroniobate monohydrate, {{a process that}} was discovered by Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac in 1866. This <b>method</b> <b>has</b> been supplanted by solvent extraction from fluoride-containing solutions of tantalum.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposed}} land-based subductive {{waste disposal}} method would dispose of nuclear waste in a subduction zone accessed from land, and therefore is not prohibited by international agreement.

40|$|Approximate Bayesian Computational (ABC) methods (or likelihood-free <b>methods)</b> <b>have</b> {{appeared}} in {{the past fifteen years}} as useful methods to perform Bayesian analyses when the likelihood is analytically or computationally intractable. Several ABC <b>methods</b> <b>have</b> been proposed: Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) <b>methods</b> <b>have</b> been developped by Marjoramet al. (2003) and by Bortotet al. (2007) for instance, and sequential <b>methods</b> <b>have</b> been proposed among others by Sissonet al. (2007), Beaumont et al. (2009) and Del Moral et al. (2009). Until now, while ABC-MCMC methods remain the reference, sequential ABC <b>methods</b> <b>have</b> appeared to outperforms them (see for example McKinley et al. (2009) or Sisson et al. (2007)). In this paper a new algorithm combining population-based MCMC methods with ABC requirements is proposed, using an analogy with the Parallel Tempering algorithm (Geyer, 1991). Performances are compared with existing ABC algorithms on simulations and on a real example...|$|R

5|$|A second {{method of}} rear delay array {{combines}} end-fire topology with polarity reversal, using two subwoofers positioned front to back, the drivers spaced one-quarter wavelength apart, the rear enclosure inverted in polarity and delayed {{by a few}} milliseconds for maximum cancellation on stage of the target frequency. This <b>method</b> <b>has</b> the least output power directed toward the audience, compared to other directional methods.|$|E
5|$|A {{variation}} of the spray transfer mode, pulse-spray {{is based on the}} principles of spray transfer but uses a pulsing current to melt the filler wire and allow one small molten droplet to fall with each pulse. The pulses allow the average current to be lower, decreasing the overall heat input and thereby decreasing the size of the weld pool and heat-affected zone while making it possible to weld thin workpieces. The pulse provides a stable arc and no spatter, since no short-circuiting takes place. This also makes the process suitable for nearly all metals, and thicker electrode wire can be used as well. The smaller weld pool gives the variation greater versatility, making it possible to weld in all positions. In comparison with short arc GMAW, this <b>method</b> <b>has</b> a somewhat slower maximum speed (85mm/s or 200in/min) and the process also requires that the shielding gas be primarily argon with a low carbon dioxide concentration. Additionally, it requires a special power source capable of providing current pulses with a frequency between 30 and 400 pulses per second. However, the <b>method</b> <b>has</b> gained popularity, since it requires lower heat input and can be used to weld thin workpieces, as well as nonferrous materials.|$|E

5|$|After production, the fermium must be {{separated}} from other actinides and from lanthanide fission products. This is usually achieved by ion-exchange chromatography, with the standard process using a cation exchanger such as Dowex50 or TEVA eluted with a solution of ammonium α-hydroxyisobutyrate. Smaller cations form more stable complexes with the α-hydroxyisobutyrate anion, and so are preferentially eluted from the column. A rapid fractional crystallization <b>method</b> <b>has</b> also been described.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} way {{to separate the}} trivalent actinides is via solvent extraction chromatography using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase. The actinide elution sequence is reversed {{from that of the}} cation-exchange resin column, so that the heavier actinides elute later. The mendelevium separated by this <b>method</b> <b>has</b> the advantage of being free of organic complexing agent compared to the resin column; the disadvantage is that mendelevium then elutes very late in the elution sequence, after fermium.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} to help with conservation efforts of stipitate hydnoid fungi, including H.peckii. While the distribution of the fungus has traditionally been determined by counting the fruit bodies, this <b>method</b> <b>has</b> a major drawback in that fruit bodies are not produced consistently every year, and the absence of fruit bodies is not an indication of the absence of its mycelium in the soil. More modern techniques using the polymerase chain reaction to assess the presence of the fungal DNA in the soil have helped alleviate the issues in monitoring the presence and distribution of fungi mycelia.|$|E
