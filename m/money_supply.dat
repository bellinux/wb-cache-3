5|$|Friedman {{was best}} known for {{reviving}} interest in the <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> as a determinant of the nominal value of output, that is, the quantity theory of money. Monetarism is the set of views associated with modern quantity theory. Its origins {{can be traced back}} to the 16th-century School of Salamanca or even further; however, Friedman's contribution is largely responsible for its modern popularization. He co-authored, with Anna Schwartz, A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960 (1963), which was an examination of the role of the <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> and economic activity in the U.S. history. A striking conclusion of their research regarded the way in which <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> fluctuations contribute to economic fluctuations. Several regression studies with David Meiselman during the 1960s suggested the primacy of the <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> over investment and government spending in determining consumption and output. These challenged a prevailing, but largely untested, view on their relative importance. Friedman's empirical research and some theory supported the conclusion that the short-run effect of a change of the <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> was primarily on output but that the longer-run effect was primarily on the price level.|$|E
5|$|The {{financing}} of war expenditures by {{the means of}} currency issues (printing money) {{was by far the}} major avenue resorted to by the Confederate government. Between 1862 and 1865, more than 60% of total revenue was created in this way. While the North doubled its <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> during the war, the <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> in the South increased twenty times over.|$|E
5|$|Monetarism {{attracted}} the attention of policy makers in the late-1970s and 1980s. Friedman and Phelps's version of the Phillips curve performed better during stagflation and gave monetarism a boost in credibility. By the mid-1970s monetarism had become the new orthodoxy in macroeconomics, and by the late-1970s central banks in the United Kingdom and United States had largely adopted a monetarist policy of targeting <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> instead of interest rates when setting policy. However, targeting monetary aggregates proved difficult for central banks because of measurement difficulties. Monetarism faced a major test when Paul Volcker took over the Federal Reserve Chairmanship in 1979. Volcker tightened the <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> and brought inflation down, creating a severe recession in the process. The recession lessened monetarism's popularity but clearly demonstrated the importance of <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> in the economy. Monetarism became less credible when once-stable money velocity defied monetarist predictions and began to move erratically in the United States during the early 1980s. Monetarist methods of single-equation models and non-statistical analysis of plotted data also lost out to the simultaneous-equation modeling favored by Keynesians. Monetarism's policies and method of analysis lost influence among central bankers and academics, but its core tenets of the long-run neutrality of money (increases in <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> cannot have long-term effects on real variables, such as output) and use of monetary policy for stabilization became a part of the macroeconomic mainstream even among Keynesians.|$|E

5|$|After McKinley's inauguration, {{increases}} in gold availability from new discoveries and improved refining methods {{led to a}} considerable increase in the <b>money</b> <b>supply.</b> Even so, in 1900, Congress passed the Gold Standard Act, formally placing the United States on that standard. Although Bryan ran again on a silver platform in the 1900 presidential election, the issue failed to produce the same resonance with the voters. McKinley won more easily than in 1896, making inroads in the silver West.|$|E

5|$|Due to its poor performance, Friedman {{believed}} that the Federal Reserve Board should be abolished. Friedman was deeply critical about Federal Reserve policies, even during the so-called 'Volcker shock' that was labelled 'monetarist.' He further {{believed that}} if the <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> was to be centrally controlled (as by the Federal Reserve System) that the preferable {{way to do it}} would be with a mechanical system that would keep the quantity of money increasing at a steady rate.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{rejected}} {{the use of}} fiscal policy {{as a tool of}} demand management; and he held that the government's role in the guidance of the economy should be restricted severely. Friedman wrote extensively on the Great Depression, which he termed the Great Contraction, arguing that it had been caused by an ordinary financial shock whose duration and seriousness were greatly increased by the subsequent contraction of the <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> caused by the misguided policies of the directors of the Federal Reserve.|$|E

5|$|On {{monetary}} issues, Blaine {{continued the}} advocacy {{for a strong}} dollar that he had begun as a Representative. The issue had shifted from debate over greenbacks to debate over which metal should back the dollar: gold and silver, or gold alone. The Coinage Act of 1873 stopped the coinage of silver for all coins worth a dollar or more, effectively tying the dollar {{to the value of}} gold. As a result, the <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> contracted and the effects of the Panic of 1873 grew worse, making it more expensive for debtors to pay debts they had entered into when currency was less valuable. Farmers and laborers, especially, clamored for the return of coinage in both metals, believing the increased <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> would restore wages and property values. Democratic Representative Richard P. Bland of Missouri proposed a bill, which passed the House, that required the United States to coin as much silver as miners could sell the government, thus increasing the <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> and aiding debtors. In the Senate, William B. Allison, a Republican from Iowa offered an amendment to limit the silver coinage to two to four million dollars per month. This was still too much for Blaine, and he denounced the bill and the proposed amendment, but the amended Bland–Allison Act passed the Senate by a 48 to 21 vote. Hayes vetoed the bill, but Congress mustered the two-thirds vote to pass it over his veto. Even after the Bland–Allison Act’s passage, Blaine continued his opposition, making a series of speeches against it during the 1878 congressional campaign season.|$|E
5|$|Quantitative easing (QE) is the {{practice}} in which a central bank tries to mitigate a potential or actual recession by increasing the <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> for its domestic economy. This {{can be done by}} printing money and injecting it into the domestic economy via open market operations. There may be a promise to destroy any newly created money once the economy improves in order to avoid inflation.|$|E
5|$|The ECB targets {{interest}} rates rather than exchange rates {{and in general}} does not intervene on the foreign exchange rate markets. This {{is because of the}} implications of the Mundell–Fleming model, which implies a central bank cannot (without capital controls) maintain interest rate and exchange rate targets simultaneously, because increasing the <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> results in a depreciation of the currency. In the years following the Single European Act, the EU has liberalised its capital markets, and as the ECB has chosen monetary autonomy, the exchange-rate regime of the euro is flexible, or floating. The result of the ECB maintaining historically low {{interest rates}} and restricting <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> has been that over the last decade the euro has become expensive relative to the currency of Europe's main trading partners. However, in 2010, the euro started on a sharp decline. Starting at U.S$1.60 in 2008, and dropping to US$1.04 in 2015.In the following months € recovered till the value of 1.19 U.S.$.

50|$|In Keynesian terms, {{followers}} of Say's law {{would argue that}} on the aggregate level, {{there is only a}} transactions demand for money.

5|$|When U.S. President Andrew Jackson {{allowed the}} charter of the Second Bank of the United States to expire in 1836, the U.S. was without any sort of central bank, and the <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> in New York City fluctuated with the country's annual {{agricultural}} cycle. Each autumn money flowed out of the city as harvests were purchased and—in an effort to attract money back—interest rates were raised. Foreign investors then sent their money to New York {{to take advantage of the}} higher rates. From the January 1906 Dow Jones Industrial Average high of 103, the market began a modest correction that would continue throughout the year. The April 1906 earthquake that devastated San Francisco contributed to the market instability, prompting an even greater flood of money from New York to San Francisco to aid reconstruction. A further stress on the <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> occurred in late 1906, when the Bank of England raised its interest rates, partly in response to UK insurance companies paying out so much to US policyholders, and more funds remained in London than expected. From their peak in January, stock prices declined 18% by July 1906. By late September, stocks had recovered about half of their losses.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1879, Walker and the {{political}} economist Henry George engaged in a prominent debate over economic rents, land, money, and taxes. Based {{on a series of}} lectures delivered at Harvard, Walker published his Land and Its Rent in 1883 as a criticism of George's 1879 Progress and Poverty. Walker's position on international bimetallism influenced his arguments that the primary cause of economic depressions was not land speculation, but rather constriction of the <b>money</b> <b>supply.</b> Walker also criticized George's assumptions that technical progress was always labor saving and whether land held for speculation was unproductive or inefficient.|$|E
5|$|For twenty years, Americans {{had been}} bitterly divided over the nation's {{monetary}} standard. The gold standard, which the United States had effectively been on since 1873, limited the <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> but eased trade with other nations, {{such as the}} United Kingdom, whose currency was also based on gold. Many Americans, however, believed that bimetallism (making both gold and silver legal tender) was necessary for the nation's economic health. The financial Panic of 1893 intensified the debates, and when Democratic President Grover Cleveland continued to support the gold standard against the will of much of his party, activists became determined {{to take over the}} Democratic Party organization and nominate a silver-supporting candidate in 1896.|$|E

5|$|Implementation of the Bland–Allison Act {{did not end}} {{calls for}} free silver. The 1880s saw a steep decline in the prices of grain and other {{agricultural}} commodities. Silver advocates argued that this dropoff, which caused the price of grain to fall below its cost of production, {{was caused by the}} failure of the government to adequately increase the <b>money</b> <b>supply,</b> which had remained steady on a per capita basis. Advocates of the gold standard attributed the decline to advances in production and transportation. The late 19th century saw divergent views in economics as the laissez-faire orthodoxy was questioned by younger economists, and both sides found ample support for their views from theorists.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the rise in prices – 14% in the twelve months to September 2008, compared with a target of 2.5% – the Central Bank of Iceland held interest rates high (15.5%). Such high interest rates, compared with 5.5% in the United Kingdom or 4% in the eurozone for example, encouraged overseas investors to hold deposits in Icelandic krónur, leading to monetary inflation: the Icelandic <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> (M3) grew 56.5% in the twelve months to September 2008, compared with 5.0% GDP growth. The situation was effectively an economic bubble, with investors overestimating the true value of the króna.|$|E
