The water areas in the bay are measured from interpretation maps of the photographs with a CALCOMP 9100 digitizer and ERDAS Image Processing System. The corresponding tidal levels are calculated using the exposure time annotated on the photographs. From these data, an approximate function relating the water area to the tidal level at a reference point is determined. Based on the function, the water areas of the Delaware Bay at <b>mean</b> <b>high</b> <b>water</b> (<b>MHW)</b> and mean low water (MLW), below 0 m, and for the tidal zone are inferred. With MHW and MLW areas and the mean tidal range, we calculate the tidal influx of the Delaware Bay, which is 2. 76 x 10 exp 9 cu m. The velocity of flood tide at the bay mouth is determined using the tidal flux and an integral of the velocity distribution function at the cross section between Cape Henlopen and Cape May.

Delineations along this dynamic margin are dependent upon the stage of tide and are demarcated by tidal datums such as <b>Mean</b> <b>High</b> <b>Water</b> (<b>MHW)</b> and Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW). This study investigated airborne lidar bathymetry (ALB) as a potential tool to support shoreline mapping.

The algorithm-derived land-water interfaces are analyzed against the reference shoreline constructed from the ortho-rectified aerial imagery simultaneously collected with the ALB data. The study area includes a variety of shoreline types such as rocky, sandy, and man-made, to evaluate the performance of the various algorithms in differing environmental conditions. Examination of the results assesses the quality of the shoreline products in comparison to current shoreline methods and considers whether ALB provides a solution to problems currently associated with shoreline mapping. This evaluation included analysis of the reliability, resolution, and uncertainty of the shoreline determinations and an assessment as to whether the land-water interfaces derived from ALB can meet charting standards...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of small-scale seismic events in enclosed water bodies, which {{can result in}} large tsunami waves capable of affecting comprehensive damage over small, geographically-confined areas are generally overlooked, although recognizing the occurrence of such events is a necessary element in adequately assessing the risk of natural hazards at specific locations.

The marine shells collected from terrestrial environments around the lake include species from a variety of environments, including offshore species with minimum preferred depths of > 13 m. The evidence suggests that this material was likely deposited by a tsunami with a runup of 2 – 3. 6 m above MHW, probably associated with the slumping of an island along the tectonically active eastern edge of the bay...|$|E
40|$|Shallow {{water tables}} {{are one of}} the most {{important}} land characteristics. They determine the potential land use: the depth is essential in the evaluation of suitability for agriculture and in nature development projects, it is also crucial to identify possible problems with other land uses. Although it is easy to derive the water table on a specific location at one point in time, the depth is highly variable in time (due to its dependence on precipitation surplus) and in space (as is easily observed when strolling through the countryside). The common method for estimating the water table depth in Flanders was by using estimates based on the existing natural drainage class map of Flanders. This natural drainage class map is based on data collected during the national soil survey. It was derived from the depth of gley mottles and the reduction horizon and the position in the landscape and is often used to predict the depth and variability of the water table. Rather than duplicating this methodology, a different method was applied based on actual measurements of the water table. The evaluation was done in three case studies in different part of Flanders: The Dijle Valley, Kluizen and Damme. These encompass some of the major regions where the water table is of great importance: sandy Flanders, river valleys in central Flanders, the coastal region and areas with temporary water tables. The method consisted of three steps: (1) Locations with sufficient water table measurements were used as reference time series. Their data were combined with daily precipitation surplus data using time series analysis to derive climate representative water table statistics. The most important statistics derived were the <b>mean</b> <b>highest</b> <b>water</b> table (<b>MHW)</b> defined as the mean value of the three <b>highest</b> <b>water</b> table levels measured biweekly (or semi-monthly) and the mean lowest water table (MLW) by using the three lowest water table levels. A continuous time series model (PIRFICT) was chosen and implemented, using the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as driver variables. (2) The data derived from these reference time series were combined with data from shorter time series. In the case of Dijle, additional series were already existing. In contrast for Kluizen and Damme, 500 locations were visited twice, once during winter and once during summer, when the water table is supposed to be on its highest/lowest respectively. This was used to estimate the MHW and MLW in these locations. (3) Finally these locations were used to create areawide predictions. Two major methods were used: remapping and relabeling methods. Relabeling methods use the old soil drainage class map and apply new attributes to the existing polygons without changing their borders. Remapping uses ancillary maps as a basis: from the digital elevation model relevant properties like slope and wetness index were derived and combined with other properties such as the horizontal and vertical distance to channels. To map MHW, MLW and drainage class, point measurements and these ancillary maps were used in a regression kriging approach. All methods proved to be superior to estimates using only the old soil drainage class maps. Nevertheless, the timing of measurements was important, and a large number of summer measurements taken in Damme during an unusually dry summmer could not be used in the further analysis, leading to much higher uncertainties associated with these maps. Apart from testing the updating methodologies in different study areas, a second subject was an evaluation of the predictive quality of the current drainage class map in different parts of Flanders. This predictive quality was evaluated by combining data from networks with good spatial but poor temporal coverage with data from networks with better temporal but poor spatial coverage. Point predictions for MHW and MLW were derived by applying time series modelling (in networks with a good temporal coverage) and by using total least squares regression (to expand to the other sites). The resulting MHW and MLW point data set was used to evaluate the currency of the existing map and to identify regional differences. The quality of the current map is moderate, and large differences occur between regions. Especially the Campine region shows large and systematic differences, whereas the southeastern hills and chalk-loam region are relatively accurate. If more weight is given to errors in the wetter drainage classes, about 50 % of the area of Flanders would benefit from remapping...|$|R

Several hundred million tons of sediment are transported to the coast and to the sea nearby annually, so the Yellow River Delta is in a continuous dynamic state due to interactions of river sediments and marine erosion. In this paper, the coastline evolution in the delta from 1976 to 2004 were studied using multi-temporal remote sensing images since the river course of the Yellow River was changed to Qing Shui Gou channel artificially in 1976. Trying to anatomize the spatio-temporal feature of coastline evolution, 21 sheets of Landsat images were used as the data source.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{a model that}} determines {{the position of the}} high water mark (HWM) based on the spatial continuity of inundation probability due to swash for a range of HWM indicators. These indicators include <b>mean</b> <b>high</b> <b>water</b> (<b>MHW),</b> high water line (HWL), and a number of shoreline features, such as the vegetation line. HWM identifies the landward extent of the ocean and is required for cadastral boundary definition, land-use and infrastructure development along the foreshore,and for planning associated with climate change adaptation. In this paper, shoreline indicators are extracted using an object-oriented image analysis (OOIA) approach. Ten-year hourly swash heights (shoreline excursion length) are fitted into a cumulative distribution function. The probability that swash will reach the various HWM indicators over a 10 y period is then estimated. The spatial continuity distances of the swash probability of HWM indicators are calculated using semivariogram models that measure similarity of swash probability. The spatial continuity distance is defined as the distance between the lower bound of sampling position (the most seaward HWM indicator) and the position where autocorrelation, or the similarity of swash probability of the various HWM indictors, approaches zero. The latter is considered as the HWM position in this study. This HWM determination method is evaluated at two study sites at different latitudes and with distinct coastal features...|$|E

In California, El Niño winters are characterized by anomalously higher and more southerly winter wave energy. This study seeks to quantify beach changes during the 2009 / 2010 El Niño Modoki from Point Conception to the Los Angeles-Long Beach Harbor, a 265 -km portion of the Southern California Bight. Two LiDAR datasets from September of 2009 and September of 2010 were used to measure the change in position of the <b>mean</b> <b>high</b> <b>water</b> (<b>MHW)</b> and mean sea level (MSL) shorelines at over 5, 000 transects spaced 50 m apart, as well as determine beach volume changes.

Distinct cells of erosion and accretion throughout the region suggest that the observed beach changes are a result of a combination of factors including geography, shoreline orientation, beach morphology, artificial structures, sediment supply, and alongshore variations in wave energy and direction. Predictions of the increasing frequency and/or intensity of El Niño events under global warming conditions underscore the importance of understanding how coastlines will respond to changes in wave climate and may help in future coastal management...|$|E
40|$|Sandy shorelines are mobile, and {{traditional}} methods for forecasting their future position {{are based on}} linear fitting and linear extrapolation of past positions. Analysis of twenty years of <b>mean</b> <b>high</b> <b>water</b> (<b>MHW)</b> shoreline positions along four shore perpendicular transects collected by the USACE at Kitty Hawk, NC shows that sandy shoreline movement is nonlinear with self-similar (fractal) scaling. Based on the observed shoreline dynamics, a new nonlinear forecasting model is developed and applied to forecast the limits bounding the Kitty Hawk, NC shoreline position three decades into the future. The forecasting method is based on creating probability envelopes to bound the MHW positions {{from the start of}} the data records forward fifty years. The probability envelope is the (+-) standard deviation as a function of three variables: a constant equal to the value of the power spectral density when 1 /period equals 1, the number of time increments, and the power scaling exponent. The forecasts are consistent with the behavior observed in the twenty-year data sets and indicate that within a 96 % confidence envelope, future MHW shoreline positions should be within 14. 6 m of the starting position, i. e. this is a stable-oscillatory shoreline. The forecasting method incorporates the observed stochastic dynamics of the shoreline position. In contrast, the traditional forecasting method assumes a linear trend and ignores the inherent nonlinear dynamics in the data. The traditional forecasting method applied to these four time series projects a linearly increasing mean that breaks the probability envelope eight years beyond the data and continues to increase linearly, forecasting a strongly accreting shoreline...|$|E

In this study, we mapped distributions of L. ramosissimum subsp. provinciale (LIRA) and L. duriusculum within the estuary and investigated how the invasion potential of the more common species, LIRA, varies with elevation and edaphic conditions. We contacted colleagues and conducted field searches to find and then map sea lavender populations. In addition, we measured LIRA’s elevational range at three salt marshes. Across this range we measured (1) soil properties: salinity, moisture, bulk density, and texture; and (2) indicators of invasion potential: LIRA size, seed production, percent cover, spread (over 1 year), recruitment, and competition with native halophytes (over 6 months). We found LIRA in 15, 144 m 2 of upper salt marsh habitat {{in central and south}} San Francisco bays and L. duriusculum in 511 m 2 in Richardson and San Pablo bays. LIRA was distributed from <b>mean</b> <b>high</b> <b>water</b> (<b>MHW)</b> to 0. 42 [*]m above mean higher high water (MHHW). In both spring and summer, soil moisture and salinity were lowest at higher elevations within LIRA’s range, which corresponded with greater rosette size, inflorescence and seed production (up to 17, 400 seeds per plant), percent cover, and recruitment. LIRA cover increased on average by 11 % in 1 year across marshes and elevations. Cover of the native halophytes Salicornia pacifica, Jaumea carnosa, and Distichlis spicata declined significantly at all elevations if LIRA were present in plots (over a 6 -month, fall–winter period). Results suggest LIRA’s invasion potential is highest above MHHW where salinity and moisture are lower, but that LIRA competes with native plants from MHW to above MHHW.

40|$|Accurate and {{consistent}} shoreline determinations {{play a major}} role in coastal management and are necessary for federal and state boundaries. Delineations along this dynamic margin are dependent upon the stage of tide and are demarcated by tidal datums such as <b>Mean</b> <b>High</b> <b>Water</b> (<b>MHW)</b> and Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW). Current shoreline mapping is dominated by passive-sensor aerial and satellite imagery in the visual and infrared part of the spectrum. The limitations of this passive-sensor technology include the requirement of day-time acquisition, optimal weather conditions, and variations introduced by individual operator interpretation that lead to shoreline products with results that cannot be reproduced. Airborne lidar bathymetry (ALB) is an active remote- sensing technology utilized world-wide for coastal-zone applications to measure bathymetry and topography. This study investigates ALB technology as a potential tool for supporting shoreline mapping. Data for this study was acquired by the United States Army Corp of Engineers (USACE) during a survey of Gerrish Island, ME and Portsmouth Harbor, NH using a SHOALS- 3000 system. Shoreline determinations from the USACE lidar dataset are obtained by a newly-devised computerized process using various algorithms that distinguish land and water. This work aims to assess the environmental sensitivity of the algorithms and determine if the reliability of the shoreline determination is affected by changes in seafloor composition. The study area includes a variety of shoreline types such as rocky, sandy, and human-altered. The algorithm-derived land-water interfaces are compared and analyzed with each other and against the reference shoreline constructed from the orthorectified aerial imagery simultaneously collected with the ALB data. The results are reviewed to assess the consistency of the shoreline vector in representing actual shoreline features as a function of algorithm and shoreline composition.

40|$|Concerns {{surrounding}} {{possible future}} climate change, sea level rise, {{and their potential}} impacts on coastal environments, have stimulated research seeking to elucidate the relationship between ocean levels and climate at the (sub) century-scale. The need for increasingly precise reconstructions of relative sea-level change has, in-turn, driven {{the development of new}} methodologies capable of resolving fine-scale variability within salt-marsh sedimentary sequences. The use of salt-marsh foraminifera as precise indicators of past tide levels has {{played a central role in}} this process and is exemplified by a number of detailed studies conducted in Connecticut, USA. In this paper, we apply the most recent methodological advance in the reconstruction of relative sea-levels using salt-marsh foraminifera. We develop a foraminiferal transfer function for tide level, derived from the modern foraminiferal distributions of four Connecticut salt-marshes. In contrast to existing approaches that employ site-specific interpolations of local vertical foraminiferal assemblage zones, this transfer function can provide objective, quantitative and reproducible estimates of palaeomarsh-surface elevation with explicitly stated error terms for marshes throughout Connecticut, irrespective of differences in tidal range. We demonstrate the foraminiferal transfer function approach by employing it to reconstruct changes in palaeomarsh-surface elevation from three cores recovered from Hammock River marsh, Connecticut. The resulting reconstructions, which are precise to ± 0. 09 m, are tested using an independent dataset from the neighbouring state of Maine, and are used to assess a pivotal record of <b>mean</b> <b>high</b> <b>water</b> (<b>MHW)</b> change from this site. We conclude that the transfer function reconstructions show good general agreement with previous records of palaeomarsh-surface elevation, but with the advantages of quantified error terms and a transparent, reproducible methodology.

A 240 m length of beach, bounded by a slipway, sea wall, and pier, was surveyed each September and April between 1997 and 2002 to assess summer and winter changes. Results in September 1997 showed that sediment transport was southerly in direction, whilst by September 2002, {{there had been a}} consistent return to the traditionally accepted south-to-north longshore drift, verified by significant differences in longshore gradients (t = 2. 664; degrees of freedom [DF] = 6; p < 0. 05). Analysis of changes in beach morphology has shown that erosion induced a southerly movement of beach contours, and a northerly movement was produced by accretion. Foreshore analysis has resulted in important regression models representing the variation of the shoreline indicator <b>mean</b> <b>high</b> <b>water</b> (<b>MHW)</b> with both shoreline position (mean beach level) and gain/loss of beach material. The cross-shore position of the depth of closure (DoC) was 50 m seaward of the survey line, at a water depth of 5. 5 m. Results from analyses of cross-shore profiles verified temporal variations in back beach level with little variation beyond the DoC. Furthermore, there was significant correlation between the two shoreline indicators, MHW and DoC (84 %). This correlation, combined with a derived equation for a management response parameter (MRP = 17. 035 + tan− 1 (x 14 − x 6) / 240 [°]), produced simple tools to rapidly assess beach health. Results were compared with past data for interpretation of significance, and management strategies based on tabulated MRP values are suggested.

40|$|Three {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} using space shuttle imagery to explain the dynamics behavior of internal waves in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans and to derive tide-related parameters for Delaware Bay. By interpreting space shuttle photographs taken during mission STS- 40, a total of 34 internal wave packets on the continental shelf of the Middle Atlantic Bight have been recognized. Using the finite-depth theory we derived that the maximum amplitude of solitons is 5. 6 m, the phase speed 0. 42 m/s, and the period 23. 8 min. Deep-ocean internal waves in the western equatorial Indian Ocean on photographs taken during mission STS- 44 were also interpreted and analyzed. The internal waves occurred {{in the form of a}} multisoliton packet in which there are about a dozen solitons. The average wavelength of the solitons is 1. 8 +/- 0. 5 km. The crest lines are mostly straight and reach as long as 100 km. The distance between two adjacent packets is about 66 km. Using the deepwater soliton theory, we derived that the mean amplitude of the solitons is 25 m, the nonlinear phase speed 1. 7 m/s, and the average period 18 min. For both cases, the semidiural tides are the principal generating mechanism. The tide-related parameters of Delaware Bay were derived from space shuttle time-series photographs taken during mission STS- 40. The water area in the bay were measured from interpretation maps of the photographs. The corresponding tidal levels were calculated using the exposure time. From these data, an approximate function relating the water area to the tidal level at a reference point was determined. Then, the water areas of the Delaware Bay at <b>mean</b> <b>high</b> <b>water</b> (<b>MHW)</b> and mean low water (MLW), below 0 m, for the tidal zone, and the tidal flux were inferred.

40|$|Tides {{are a key}} {{component}} in coastal extreme water levels. Possible changes in the tides caused by mean sea-level rise (SLR) are therefore of importance {{in the analysis of}} coastal flooding, as well as many other applications. We investigate the effect of future SLR on the tides globally using a fully global forward tidal model: OTISmpi. Statistical comparisons of the modelled and observed tidal solutions demonstrate the skill of the refined model setup with no reliance on data assimilation. We simulate the response of the four primary tidal constituents to various SLR scenarios. Particular attention is paid to future changes at the largest 136 coastal cities, where changes in water level would have the greatest impact. Spatially uniform SLR scenarios ranging from 0. 5 to 10 m with fixed coastlines show that the tidal amplitudes in shelf seas globally respond strongly to SLR with spatially coherent areas of increase and decrease. Changes in the M 2 and S 2 constituents occur globally in most shelf seas, whereas changes in K 1 and O 1 are confined to Asian shelves. With higher SLR tidal changes are often not proportional to the SLR imposed and larger portions of <b>mean</b> <b>high</b> <b>water</b> (<b>MHW)</b> changes are above proportional. Changes in MHW exceed ± 10 % of the SLR at ~ 10 % of coastal cities. SLR scenarios allowing for coastal recession tend increasingly to result in a reduction in tidal range. The fact that the fixed and recession shoreline scenarios result mainly in changes of opposing sign is explained by the effect of the perturbations on the natural period of oscillation of the basin. Our results suggest that coastal management strategies could influence the sign of the tidal amplitude change. The effect of a spatially varying SLR, in this case fingerprints of the initial elastic response to ice mass loss, modestly alters the tidal response with the largest differences at high latitudes...|$|E
