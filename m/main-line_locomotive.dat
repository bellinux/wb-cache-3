5000|$|The {{prototype}} {{for the new}} B class (later classified B1) 4-6-0 was built at Darlington and entered service on 12 December 1942. It was the first 2-cylinder <b>main-line</b> <b>locomotive</b> constructed for the LNER since the grouping, such had been Sir Nigel Gresley's faith in the 3 cylinder layout. With cost saving a wartime priority the LNER's draughtsmen {{went to great lengths}} to re-use existing patterns, jigs and tools to economise on materials and labour. Extensive use was made of welding instead of steel castings. The boiler was derived from the Diagram 100A type fitted to the LNER Class B17 Sandringham 4-6-0s but with a larger grate area and an increase in boiler pressure to [...]|$|E

50|$|In 1999, a new twin {{converter}} transmission, the L 620 reU2, {{was developed}} for high-performance, <b>main-line</b> <b>locomotives.</b> The new L 620 reU2 was equipped with both a start-up converter, having a diameter of 525 mm, {{as well as a}} travel-phase converter, having a diameter of 434 mm. The design of the new L 620 re U2 was based on its successful predecessor, the L 520 rzU2 which had a power rating of 1,400 kW. This new transmission however was rated significantly higher at 2,700 kW and therefore virtually all of its components had to be enlarged as well as reinforced. In the standard version of the transmission, two gears were mounted on the secondary shaft rather than using the idler wheel found in the older L 520 rzU2. As a result, the drive shaft's output speed could be adjusted to suit the locomotive's power requirements. The drive shaft's main bearing was also enlarged to 550 mm. In general, this new high-performance transmission clearly illustrated the enormous capability of hydrodynamic couplings. With a weight-to-power ratio of only 2.06 kg/kW, the new L 620 reU2 set a record for locomotive transmissions. By comparison, the similar L 520 rzU2 transmission had a far higher weight-to-power ratio of 2.4 kg/kW. In addition, a newly designed hydrodynamic retarder, the KB 385, was available as an optional component. At Vossloh, the locomotive manufacturer based in Kiel, these transmissions were installed in both its G1700 and G2000 <b>main-line</b> <b>locomotives.</b> Finally, the latest development is the LS 640 reU2 transmission which will be used {{for the first time in}} the Voith Maxima locomotive having 3,600 kW. The LS 640 reU2 is a so-called split turbo-transmission which uses two drive shafts from the L 620 reU2 to power both bogies of a six axle diesel locomotive.|$|R

50|$|Tondiarpet {{diesel loco}} shed is located {{to the north}} of the station. Established in 1972 with the {{induction}} of a WDS4B-model diesel locomotive (WDS4B #19202), the shed was built to cater the shunting requirements of the marshalling yard at Tondiarpet, the goods sheds at Royapuram and Salt Cotaurs, and the coaching depot at Basin Bridge in Chennai division. With the augmentation of the fleet of WDS4B locos to 64, they were used in other locations in other divisions. In 2001, these were replaced with the WDM7-model <b>main-line</b> <b>locomotives</b> for passenger and yard shunting work. In April 2007, mainline WDM2-model locomotives were additionally inducted for hauling goods. As of June 2010, the total stock at the shed is 66, including 33 WDS4B locomotives, 4 WDS4D locomotives, 15 WDM2 locomotives and 14 WDM7 locomotives. In 2005, the shed registered the maximum holding of 74 locomotives. The shed has a total area of 75,000 sq m, including a covered area of 6,652 sq m, has a capacity of 50 locomotives. The shed employs about 378 persons.|$|R

In the 1940s, the LNER had some <b>main-line</b> diesel <b>locomotives</b> on order.

5000|$|As CME in post-war {{austerity}} Britain, Ivatt {{continued to}} build standard existing LMS locomotive types for which parts were readily available. Two additional LMS Princess Coronation Class 4-6-2 express locomotives were built and several modified Black Fives {{and the work}} of 'rebuilding' the Royal Scot and Patriot classes continued. The LMS Ivatt Class 4 2-6-0 was introduced as well as the notable [...] "Mickey Mouse" [...] LMS Ivatt Class 2 2-6-0 and LMS Ivatt Class 2 2-6-2T, built to replace life expired 19th century branch line 0-6-0 and motor train 2-4-2T locomotive types, and the Class WT 2-6-4T locomotives for the Northern Counties Committee. The famous Ivatt twins, diesel-electric locomotives numbered 10000 and 10001, built by the LMS at Derby in association with English Electric were Britain's first <b>main-line</b> diesel <b>locomotives</b> and were designed to operate singly or in pairs.|$|R
25|$|Diesel {{locomotives}} offer significant operating {{advantages over}} steam locomotives. They can safely be operated by one person, making them ideal for switching/shunting duties in yards (although for safety reasons many <b>main-line</b> diesel <b>locomotives</b> {{continue to have}} 2-man crews: an engineer and a conductor/switchman) and the operating environment is much more attractive, being much quieter, fully weatherproof and without the dirt and heat that is an inevitable part of operating a steam locomotive. Diesel locomotives can be worked in multiple with a single crew controlling multiple locomotives throughout a single train—something not practical with steam locomotives. This brought greater efficiencies to the operator, as individual locomotives could be relatively low-powered {{for use as a}} single unit on light duties but marshaled together to provide the power needed on a heavy train still under the control of a single crew. With steam traction a single very powerful and expensive locomotive was required for the heaviest trains or the operator resorted to double heading with multiple locomotives and crews, a method which was also expensive and brought with it its own operating difficulties.|$|R
5000|$|On 9 May 1894, La Fusée Electrique made a {{trial run}} from Saint-Lazare station, Paris to Mantes-la-Jolie, hauling a train {{consisting}} eight carriages. The 53 km journey took 55 minutes. A speed of 107 km/h {{was reported to}} have been achieved. Following the test run, the locomotive hauled a regular service train back to Paris. Trials showed that the engine used 15% less coal than a conventional steam engine. The locomotive was said to ride [...] "like a Pullman carriage." [...] Criticisms of the locomotive were that it was [...] "too complicated, too costly, too heavy". These same arguments would be repeated with the introduction of <b>main-line</b> diesel-electric <b>locomotives</b> some half a century later. The locomotive completed around 2000 km of test runs. Two larger locomotives were ordered for further trials on the CF de l'Ouest. La Fusée Electrique had been dismantled by 1897, with the bogies being used for two 0-8-0 electric locomotives which were employed on the 4 km underground railway between Saint-Germain Ouest and Grande-Ceinture.|$|R
2500|$|In 1996 the Deltic 9000 Fund {{registered}} {{itself at}} Companies House as Deltic 9000 Locomotives Ltd (DNLL) {{with the objective}} of returning its <b>locomotives</b> to <b>main-line</b> service and on 30 November 1996 D9000 [...] hauled the 'Deltic Deliverance' charter from Edinburgh to King's Cross. Although this tour ended prematurely at Berwick-upon-Tweed, D9000 went on to haul many charter trains and service trains for both Anglia Railways and Virgin Trains until 2003. Subsequently, DNLL's other Deltic, D9016 Gordon Highlander returned to main-line working (it was temporarily painted in a purple and grey livery based upon the house colours of Porterbrook Leasing, who helped finance the restoration), as did the Deltic Preservation Society's D9009 Alycidon and D9019 Royal Highland Fusilier. Between 1997 and 2003 all four <b>main-line</b> certified <b>locomotives</b> saw frequent charter and spot hire use, including on the Venice Simplon Orient Express. A highlight of this period was 22 May 1999, when D9000 Royal Scots Grey, D9009 Alycidon and 55 019 Royal Highland Fusilier were all in operation on the East Coast Main Line on the same day – D9000 running the [...] "George Mortimer Pullman" [...] British Pullman between Victoria and Bradford Forster Square and the DPS Deltics working two charter trains between King's Cross and York. On the return run from Bradford, D9000 was held in platform 1 at Doncaster, whilst 55 019 passed on the up through line. D9000 then followed 55 019 as far as Belle Isle, where it diverged for the run around London to Victoria.|$|R

After a transfer by ferry to Harwich, the journey resumed by train again to arrive in London's Liverpool Street station on 4 September, where it was met by the 100-year-old Sir Nicholas himself.
