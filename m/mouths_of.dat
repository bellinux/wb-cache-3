5|$|Draining about , the Columbia Slough {{watershed}} lies in {{the floodplain}} of the Columbia River between the <b>mouths</b> <b>of</b> the Sandy River {{to the east and}} the Willamette River. Parts of Portland, Fairview, Gresham, Maywood Park, Wood Village, and unincorporated Multnomah County lie within the drainage basin (watershed). As of 2005, about 158,000people, 5percent of Oregon's population, lived in the basin.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{the habitat}} quality of upper Fishing Creek {{and its tributaries}} were rated {{on a scale of}} 1 to 200 (with a higher rating {{indicating}} better habitability) by Point Park University and the Fishing Creek Sportsmans' Association. Most of this part of the creek and its tributaries were rated 166 or higher, which was considered optimal. The waters near the <b>mouths</b> <b>of</b> West Branch and East Branch Fishing Creeks, and Fishing Creek near Benton, were rated 113 to 160, considered suboptimal. A portion of West Creek was rated 60–112, considered marginal.|$|E
5|$|In the whaleboat, Melville had, like De Long, ridden out {{the storm}} {{by means of a}} sea anchor. The boat's course was far to the south of De Long's; they finally reached land at one of the main <b>mouths</b> <b>of</b> the Lena, and were able to {{navigate}} upriver. Within a few days they encountered a native fishing camp, and by September 25 had reached the settlement of Arrhu. Chipp's cutter never reached land; overwhelmed by the storm, it presumably foundered, with the loss of all eight on board.|$|E

5000|$|In the mid-1940s it {{was decided}} to build a third runway for the Sydney Airport. This runway was to jut out into Botany Bay at the {{position}} <b>of</b> the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Cooks River. It took several years to relocate the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the river to its current position and to landfill the former <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the river. This relocating <b>of</b> the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the river allowed for widening and deepening <b>of</b> the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the river and the now adjacent <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the river's tributary, Muddy Creek. The widened and deepened <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> Muddy Creek was renamed Kyeemagh Canal. One consequence of this change in position <b>of</b> the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the river also meant the shortening of and other modifications to Lady Robinsons Beach. The changes in Muddy Creek allowed boating facilities and so the Brighton Fishermans Club ( [...] formerly the Brighton-le-Sands Amateur Fishmans Club) was formed.|$|R
50|$|The name Kimsquit is {{associated}} with a former Nuxalk village at the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Dean River, just to the southeast <b>of</b> the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Kimsquit River. It is also the namesake of Kimsquit Peak, which is east <b>of</b> the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Kimsquit River and immediately north <b>of</b> the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Dean, and of Kimsquit Ridge, which is alongside the Kimsquit River on its west side a few miles upstream from its mouth.

5|$|Mantas {{evolved from}} bottom-dwelling stingrays, {{eventually}} developing more wing-like pectoral fins. M. birostris {{still has a}} vestigial remnant of a sting barb {{in the form of}} a caudal spine. The <b>mouths</b> <b>of</b> most rays lie on the underside of the head, while in mantas they are right at the front. Manta rays and devil rays are the only ray species that have evolved into filter feeders.|$|E
5|$|Some turbellarians have {{a simple}} pharynx lined with cilia and {{generally}} feed by using cilia to sweep food particles and small prey into their mouths, which are usually {{in the middle of}} their undersides. Most other turbellarians have a pharynx that is eversible (can be extended by being turned inside-out), and the <b>mouths</b> <b>of</b> different species can be anywhere along the underside. The freshwater species Microstomum caudatum can open its mouth almost as wide as its body is long, to swallow prey about as large as itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of timber continued onto the mainland, prompting one observer to remark that no usable trees were left standing between the <b>mouths</b> <b>of</b> the Waccasassa and Suwannee rivers. In Williston, {{nearly a dozen}} residences were destroyed, killing {{at least one person}} and injuring 15 more. Six prison inmates were killed by a falling tree on a farm near the town, and in total, about 13 people lost their lives in mainland Levy County. Damage throughout the county, including the Cedar Keys, was estimated at $450,000.|$|E

5|$|The novel {{deals on}} a {{personal}} level with the change in Bond from a depressed man in mourning, to a man of action bent on revenge, to an amnesiac living as a Japanese fisherman. Through the <b>mouths</b> <b>of</b> his characters, Fleming also examines the decline of post-World WarII British power and influence, notably in relation to the United States. The book was popular with the public, with pre-orders in the UK totalling 62,000; critics were more muted in their reactions, generally delivering mixed reviews of the novel.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{categories}} of thorium minerals for thorium extraction: primary and secondary. Primary deposits occur in acidic granitic magmas and pegmatites. They are concentrated, but of small size. Secondary deposits occur at the <b>mouths</b> <b>of</b> rivers in granitic mountain regions. In these deposits, thorium is enriched along with other heavy minerals. Initial concentration varies {{with the type of}} deposit.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} safety {{meetings}} were scheduled {{in order to}} prevent accidents on the set. One of the items on the agenda was finding the closest hospital to the set, according to make-up effects coordinator John Vulich. Furthermore, several of the cast and crew members had a fear of snakes, including Manners, David Duchovny, and John Shiban. During one of the days that the show was being prepped, a snake wrangler brought several live rattlesnakes to the set, but one escaped. It was eventually found behind Manners' desk. In order to prevent future accidents, the <b>mouths</b> <b>of</b> the snakes were sutured shut.|$|E

5|$|From 27 May to 4 July, Wettin {{was back}} in the North Sea, patrolling the <b>mouths</b> <b>of</b> the Jade, Ems, and Elbe rivers. During this period, the naval high command {{realized}} that the old Wittelsbach-class ships would be useless in action against the Royal Navy, but could be effectively used against the much weaker Russian forces in the Baltic. As a result, the ships were transferred back to the Baltic in July, and they departed Kiel on the 7th, bound for Danzig. On 10 July, the ships proceeded further east to Neufahrwassar, along with the VIII Torpedo-boat Flotilla. The IV Squadron ships sortied on 12 July to make a demonstration, returning to Danzig on 21 July without encountering Russian forces.|$|E
5|$|From the Glades peoples, {{two major}} nations {{emerged in the}} area: the Calusa and the Tequesta. The Calusa was {{the largest and most}} {{powerful}} nation in South Florida. It controlled fifty villages located on Florida's west coast, around Lake Okeechobee, and on the Florida Keys. Most Calusa villages were located at the <b>mouths</b> <b>of</b> rivers or on key islands. The Calusa were hunter-gatherers who lived on small game, fish, turtles, alligators, shellfish, and various plants. Most of their tools were made of bone or teeth, although sharpened reeds were also effective for hunting or war. Calusa weapons consisted of bows and arrows, atlatls, and spears. Canoes were used for transportation, and South Florida tribes often canoed through the Everglades, but rarely lived in them. Canoe trips to Cuba were also common.|$|E
5|$|Having first {{inhabited}} Pennsylvania between 16,000 and 10,000 BCE, nomadic Native Americans {{reached the}} {{area near the}} mouth of Fishing Creek by 8000 BCE. By 3000 to 2000 BCE, some of them were going into the Fishing Creek valley during the winter to hunt deer and bears and returning to the Susquehanna River in the summer, creating trade routes. There was no permanent habitation until 1000 BCE when some Native American villages were built at the mouth of Fishing Creek. The Native Americans who settled in this area included the Shawnee and Susquehannock Indians. A Native American path ran along the creek from Bloomsburg to Orangeville before turning away in the direction of Tunkhannock Creek. Since at least 1769, there has also been a path between the <b>mouths</b> <b>of</b> Huntington and Green Creeks.|$|E

5|$|Supplies for {{the advance}} were transported over land and by sea {{but it was}} only with great {{difficulty}} that two infantry divisions of XXI Corps and three mounted divisions of Desert Mounted Corps were maintained in the advance at such distances from base. The Navy transported stores to the <b>mouths</b> <b>of</b> the Wadi Hesi and the Nahr Sukherier as these lines were secured. The railhead was being pushed forward as rapidly as possible, but did not reach Deir Suneid until 28 November. So it was a considerable distance over which the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps worked to bring up supplies.|$|E
5|$|The sand whiting is an inshore species, inhabiting exposed {{coastal areas}} such as beaches, sandbars and surf zones as well as quieter bays, {{estuaries}} and coastal lakes. Sand whiting enter estuaries, including intermittently open ones, and penetrate far upstream to the tidal limits of rivers and creeks where juveniles and adolescent fish may be abundant. The adults congregate around the <b>mouths</b> <b>of</b> estuaries, bars, and spits, in depths down to 5 m where they may constitute {{a large percentage of}} the icthyofauna of such regions. As implied by their name, they are often found exclusively over sandy substrates, with occasional appearances in Zostera seagrass beds. Individuals are occasionally taken in offshore waters to 40 m during winter.|$|E
5|$|Thomas's fleet {{arrived at}} the capital first. Facing no {{opposition}} from the Imperial Fleet, the rebels broke or unfastened the chain and entered the Golden Horn, taking station near the <b>mouths</b> <b>of</b> the Barbysos river, where they awaited the arrival of Thomas and his army. Thomas arrived in early December. The sight of his huge force did not cow the capital's inhabitants: unlike the provinces, the capital's citizens and garrison stood firmly behind Michael. To further encourage his troops, Michael had his young son Theophilos lead a procession along the walls, carrying {{a piece of the}} True Cross and the mantle of the Virgin Mary, while a large standard was hoisted on top of the Church of St. Mary at Blachernae, in full view of both armies.|$|E

5|$|Aquatic life ties North American river otters almost {{exclusively}} to permanent watersheds. The river otters favor bog lakes with banked shores containing semiaquatic mammal burrows and lakes with beaver lodges. The otters avoid water bodies with gradually sloping shorelines of sand or gravel. In Maine, use of watersheds by river otters is negatively associated with the proportion of mixed hardwood-softwood stands in forested areas adjacent to waterways. However, it is positively associated {{with the number of}} beaver flowages, watershed length, and average shoreline diversity. In Idaho, river otters prefer valley habitats over mountainous terrain, and they select valley streams over valley lakes, reservoirs, and ponds. Log jams are heavily used when present. In Florida, inhabitation of North American river otters is lowest in freshwater marshes, intermediate in salt marshes, and highest in swamp forests. During the dry season, they will recede from the marshland and move to permanent ponds, where water is available and food is in greater supply. In Idaho and Massachusetts, ecological elements preferred for latrine sites include large conifers, points of land, beaver bank dens and lodges, isthmuses, <b>mouths</b> <b>of</b> permanent streams, or any object that protrudes from the water.|$|E
