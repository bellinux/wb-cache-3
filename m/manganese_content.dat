5|$|The <b>manganese</b> <b>content</b> of some {{iron ores}} used in Greece led to speculations that steel {{produced}} from that ore contains additional manganese, making the Spartan steel exceptionally hard. Around {{the beginning of}} the 19th century, manganese was used in steelmaking and several patents were granted. In 1816, it was documented that iron alloyed with manganese was harder but not more brittle. In 1837, British academic James Couper noted an association between miners' heavy exposure to manganese with a form of Parkinson's disease. In 1912, United States patents were granted for protecting firearms against rust and corrosion with manganese phosphate electrochemical conversion coatings, and the process has seen widespread use ever since.|$|E
40|$|Magnesium and <b>manganese</b> <b>contents</b> were {{measured}} by {{atomic absorption spectrophotometry}} in bacteria of several halophilic levels, in Vibrio costicola, a moderately halophilic eubacterium growing in 1 M NaCl, Halobacterium volcanii, a halophilic archaebacterium growing in 2. 5 M NaCl, Halobacterium cutirubrum, an extremely halophilic archaebacterium growing in 4 M NaCl, and Escherichia coli, a nonhalophilic eubacterium growing in 0. 17 M NaCl. Magnesium and <b>manganese</b> <b>contents</b> varied with the growth phase, being maximal at the early log phase. Magnesium and manganese molalities in cell water were shown to increase with the halophilic character of the logarithmically growing bacteria, from 30 mmol of Mg per kg of cell water and 0. 37 mmol of Mn per kg of cell water for E. coli to 102 mmol of Mg per kg of cell water and 1. 6 mmol of Mn per kg of cell water for H. cutirubrum. The intracellular concentrations of manganese were determined independently by a radioactive tracer technique in V. costicola and H. volcanii. The values obtained by 54 Mn loading represented about 70 % of the values obtained by atomic absorption.

25|$|Groundwater: The water {{emerging}} from some deep ground water may have fallen as rain many tens, hundreds, {{or thousands of}} years ago. Soil and rock layers naturally filter the ground water to {{a high degree of}} clarity and often, it does not require additional treatment besides adding chlorine or chloramines as secondary disinfectants. Such water may emerge as springs, artesian springs, or may be extracted from boreholes or wells. Deep ground water is generally of very high bacteriological quality (i.e., pathogenic bacteria or the pathogenic protozoa are typically absent), but the water may be rich in dissolved solids, especially carbonates and sulfates of calcium and magnesium. Depending on the strata through which the water has flowed, other ions may also be present including chloride, and bicarbonate. There may be a requirement to reduce the iron or <b>manganese</b> <b>content</b> of this water to make it acceptable for drinking, cooking, and laundry use. Primary disinfection may also be required. Where groundwater recharge is practiced (a process in which river water is injected into an aquifer to store the water in times of plenty so that it is available in times of drought), the groundwater may require additional treatment depending on applicable state and federal regulations.|$|E

5000|$|Most steels contain 0.15 to 0.8% manganese. High {{strength}} alloys often contain 1 to 1.8% manganese. At about 1.5% <b>manganese</b> <b>content,</b> {{the steel}} becomes brittle, and this trait increases until about 4 to 5% <b>manganese</b> <b>content</b> is reached.

The primary of these alloying agents is carbon, because the addition of manganese to low-carbon steel has little effect, but increases dramatically with increasing carbon content. The original Hadfield steel contained about 1.0% carbon.

40|$|The {{contents}} {{of iron and}} manganese in participate matter separated with millipore filter from surface waters sampled in 1966 - 1967 during the cruise of research vessel FUJI to Antarctica have been analyzed. Iron was determined by absorption spectrophotometric measurement of the complexes formed {{in the presence of}} bathophenanthroline. Oxidation of leucomalachite green with periodate in the presence of manganese has been used for the quantification of submicrogram amounts of manganese. The results indicated that the horizontal distribution of iron and <b>manganese</b> <b>contents</b> was low in the western Pacific and {{in the northern part of}} the Indian Ocean, and high in the southern part of the Indian Ocean and in the Antarctic Ocean. The concentration of iron in particulate matter from surface water of all oceans and seas ranged from 0. 003 to 0. 140 μg-at/l with an average value of 0. 038 μg-at/l, and concentration of manganese ranged from 0. 0005 to 0. 0098 μg-at/l with an average value of 0. 0031 μg-at/l. A positive correlation was ascertained between the amount of iron and that of manganese contained in the particulate matter.

40|$|This study {{reports on}} data {{obtained}} from a pilot survey focusing on house dust and toenail metal(loids) concentrations in residents living in the industrial city of Estarreja. The study design hereby described aims at investigating relationships between human toenails and both copper and manganese levels in settled house dusts. A total of 21 households and 30 individuals were recruited for the pilot study: 19 households corresponding to 27 residents living near the industrial complex, forming the exposed group, plus 2 households and 3 residents from residential areas with no anticipated environmental contaminants that were used for comparison. Factorial analysis was used for source identification purposes. Investigation on the potential influence of environmental factors over copper and manganese levels in the toenails was carried out via questionnaire data and multiple correspondence analysis. The results show that copper concentrations are more elevated in the indoor dusts, while manganese concentrations are more elevated in the outdoor dust samples. The geometrical relationships in the datasets suggest that the backyard soil is a probable source of manganese to the indoor dust. Copper and <b>manganese</b> <b>contents</b> in the toenail clippings are more elevated in children than in adults, but {{the difference between the}} two age groups is not statistically significant (p > 0. 05).

40|$|Weld metal {{strength}} and toughness are determined by its microstructure, which is in turn determined by the concentration of various alloying elements and impurities {{as well as the}} welding thermal cycle. This study investigated the effects of systematically varying the <b>manganese</b> oxide <b>content</b> in the flux used for HY-l 00 submerged arc welds. A trial addition of cerium oxide was also performed. Specimens were compared using mechanical properties, weld metal chemistry, inclusion chemistry, and microstructural analysis. It was found that cerium oxide addition and the correct amount of manganese oxide resulted in improved toughness. These improved properties were determined to arise from a low proportion of bainite in the fully reaustenitized region of the weld metal HAZ in these multipass welds. In the MnO series welds, the bainite is replaced by a fine low carbon martensite due to the increased weld metal hardenability. In the CeO 2 weld it is replaced by acicular ferrite due to the lowering of the austenite grain boundary energy by the cerium. The production of a series of welds with different <b>manganese</b> <b>contents</b> also resulted in the extension of existing theories of weld metal deoxidation. p 3. NANAU. S. Navy (U. S.
