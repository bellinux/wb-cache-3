40|$|The {{awareness}} {{of the importance of}} multicultural music in the Malaysian primary music education has increased due to the requirements set by the National Curriculum Standards for Primary School in music education in Malaysia. Therefore, {{it can be said that}} multicultural music is not an optional component to be included or disregarded at the discretion of the teacher in the music classroom. Music teachers are expected to foster multicultural music educational programs that address the diverse needs of students. in the context of sustainability of <b>multicultural</b> music <b>education,</b> it is important to know that the current status of music teachers’ attitudes and practices with regard to <b>multicultural</b> music <b>education</b> such as what and how effective are the practices and their perceptions as far as the multicultural music is concerned. Therefore, this study examined Malaysian general music teachers’ utilization of <b>multicultural</b> music <b>education</b> in the music curriculum, specifically exploring the relationship between the general music teachers’ attitudes and their efforts in developing and implementing <b>multicultural</b> music <b>education</b> in music classes. This study utilized an adaptation of the original Music Specialist’s <b>Multicultural</b> Music <b>Education</b> Survey instrument which was administered to 456 of primary schools’ general music teachers in Malaysia. This instrument was used to measure teachers’ attitudes and practices regarding <b>multicultural</b> music <b>education.</b> Data analysis included descriptive statistics, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and correlational analysis (pearson product-moment correlation). Results indicate that there is limited implementation of <b>multicultural</b> music <b>education</b> in the music classrooms due to inadequate preparation and limited resources, and insufficient knowledge in multicultural music. As such, it is important to ensure music teachers develop a more critical understanding of <b>multicultural</b> music <b>education</b> include producing and developing more instructional materials and learning aids, which are suitable for primary students and appropriate for the Malaysian context.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the perceptions of the music teachers associated to the teaching of <b>multicultural</b> music <b>education</b> in Malaysian primary schools. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews. The findings that were examined in this paper address the following research questions: l) What are the perceptions of music teachers regarding <b>multicultural</b> music <b>education</b> provided by their teacher training programs? 2) What aspects of teaching <b>multicultural</b> music <b>education</b> do music teachers perceive as most challenging? 3) What teaching approaches and activities are the most appropriate for multicultural music in the primary music classes? The findings revealed that music teachers reported that they did not have adequate multicultural training during their college courses. Besides, there is limited implementation of <b>multicultural</b> music <b>education</b> in music classrooms due to that many music teachers do not possess appropriate multicultural music knowledge and resources to teach multicultural music. Music teachers also reported that the activities and approaches used in class must involve the students actively, rather than passively receptive and also need to allow them to obtain first-hand experience of playing the traditional musical instruments. Therefore, music teacher training programmes are needed in order to address both the theoretical and practical aspects of <b>multicultural</b> music <b>education</b> throughout the curriculum in a comprehensive and long-term manner.

40|$|This {{study has}} two fold {{purposes}} to examine 1) {{the level of}} multiculturalism in terms of life experience, personal attitudes, personal behaviour, and professional behaviour amongst the general music teachers; and 2) the utilization of <b>multicultural</b> music <b>education</b> by the teachers in curriculum and activities. More specifically, this study also intends to explore {{the relationship between the}} general music teacher’s behaviour and their efforts in developing and implementing <b>multicultural</b> music <b>education</b> in music classes. The simple random sampling procedure was used in this study. The subjects included the primary schools’ general music teachers (N= 456) in the Klang Valley, Malaysia. To address the purpose of the study, the quantitative survey questionnaires were used. The two existing modified survey instruments, namely the Personal Multicultural Assessment and the Music Specialist’s <b>Multicultural</b> Music <b>Education</b> Survey, were used in this study upon the permission-to-use granted by the respective researchers. The Personal Multicultural Assessment was used to measure the level of general music teachers’ multiculturalism while the Music Specialist’s <b>Multicultural</b> Music <b>Education</b> was used to measure teachers’ attitudes and practices regarding <b>multicultural</b> music <b>education.</b> Data analysis included descriptive statistics, analysis of variance (ANOVA), correlational analysis (Pearson product-moment correlation), and multiple regression to assess and evaluate the relationship between teacher’s life experience, personal attitudes, personal behaviour, and professional behaviour; and their developing and employing of <b>multicultural</b> music <b>education.</b> iv In general, this study found that the primary schools’ general music teachers (N= 456) in the Klang Valley, Malaysia are functioning at varying levels of multiculturalism. The teachers’ Personal Multicultural Assessment mean scores ranked at the second level of the Multicultural Personae Construct in the areas of life experience, personal attitudes, personal behaviour and on the composite score. The area of personal attitude was ranked the lowest mean scores among the four subscales. On the other hand, score was highest on the professional behaviour subscale which ranked at the third level of the Multicultural Personae Construct. Results of One-Way of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) procedures indicated that ethnic identity and religion had significant effects on the life experience subscale, personal attitudes subscale, personal behaviour subscale and the composite scale of Personal Multicultural Assessment. However, the only variable that had a significant effect on the professional behaviour subscale scores of the general music teachers was religion. General music teachers from the Klang Valley ranked the category of “Definition of multicultural music education” as the highest and “Training and support with multicultural music education” as the lowest among the four classifications of Music Specialist’s <b>Multicultural</b> Music <b>Education</b> Survey. Gender and religion had significant effects on the Music Specialist’s <b>Multicultural</b> Music <b>Education</b> Survey.

The teachers' Personal Multicultural Assessment mean scores ranked at the third level of the Multicultural Personae in the areas of Personal Behavior, Professional Behavior, and on the Composite score. The areas of Life Experience and Personal Attitude ranked at the second level of the Multicultural Personae. Statistically significant relationships were found between the population of the teachers' hometown and the Life Experience subscale score and the Composite score.
