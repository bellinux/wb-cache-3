A few years later, the global Financial crisis of 2007–2010 rocked the {{financial}} {{well-being of the}} SAR's financial sector. [...] The Lehman <b>mini-bond</b> crisis was one that affected the territory greatly. Joseph Yam, the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority who was the highest paid central banker in the world resigned in 2009. [...] Traditionally, HK dollar is pegged against the US dollar. Questions have come up on whether HK should peg to the Chinese yuan since it is integrated to China economically.

40|$|The {{financial}} meltdown due to credit crunch in 2008 was in which has shaken the entire global financial industry, sparing no one (from investors, to top executives, to junior bank staff, to all stakeholders). What is unbelievable {{to me is}} not {{the intensity of the}} impact of credit crunch on the entire global system. What appalls me is the shocking revelation that many investors of Lehman Brother <b>mini-bonds</b> do not really know what they have invested their money in. If Lehman Brothers had not failed and collapsed, many would still think they have bought a ‘guaranteed’ investment product. This led me to doing this thesis on a financial instrument (convertible bonds) that is not familiar among retail investors, particular among those that are not so invest-savvy. The thesis aims to give an average non invest-savvy retail investor a better idea of this financial instrument before making decision in investing in it. Convertible Bonds is one of the types of Convertible Securities, a category of new financial products that was birthed from the process of Financial Engineering. The name ‘Convertible Bonds’ has been a new name heard in the financial markets in recent years but little of it has been heard among the retail investors’ public. The objective of this dissertation paper is to explore the characteristics of this new instrument that a retail investor should now as well as advantages and disadvantages of investing in it. We will also look at the reasons why some companies choose to issue this instrument instead of a straight bond or equity (common stock). What we can see in this paper, therefore, will be the features of a convertible bond, its evolution and history, why issuers issue them, what an investor should know about investing in them as well as the recommended way to invest in such a complicated/ exotic financial product...|$|R

5000|$|In July 2017, {{the club}} asked fans to {{contribute}} towards a <b>mini-bond</b> investment scheme {{in an attempt}} to fund the remaining £500,000 needed to go towards developing the new North Stand. The <b>mini-bond</b> would earn investors interest on a six-month basis, and is [...] "effectively a loan to the football club which will attract interest at the rate of 4% per year, or fans can opt to double that rate and take an 8% credit". The club stated its desire to open the new stand {{for the start of the}} 2018 - 19 season if the bond scheme is successful.|$|E
50|$|Alternative finance {{refers to}} {{financial}} channels and instruments {{that have emerged}} outside of the traditional finance system such as regulated banks and capital markets. Examples of alternative financing activities through 'online marketplaces' are reward-based crowdfunding, equity crowdfunding, peer-to-peer consumer and business lending, invoice trading third party payment platforms. Alternative finance instruments include cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, SME <b>mini-bond,</b> social impact bond, community shares, private placement and other 'shadow banking' mechanisms. Alternative Finance differs to traditional banking or capital market finance through technology-enabled 'disintermediation', which means utilising third party capital by connecting fundraisers directly with funders, in turn, reducing transactional costs and improve market efficiency.|$|E

40|$|The {{mortgage}} loan {{has evolved from}} a local lending instrument into a major global security and its role is unparallel to other financial instruments {{in the process of}} financial globalization. This paper explains how technology and financial innovation transformed the {{mortgage loan}} from a local security into a premier global security traded worldwide. It examines the fundamental flaws of this process and why it does not work in regards to mortgage lending and the re-securitization products that were created through financial innovation. The findings show that regulation was unable to keep pace with financial innovation, which created an environment where actors in the financial service sector were able to behave geographically irresponsibly by using information asymmetries to their advantage by participating in moral hazard activities and engaging in other immoral and unethical business practices that were centered around localized geography, which ultimately contributed to the global financial crisis. It also examines the roll of financial innovation in regard to the Lehman Brothers <b>Mini-Bond</b> in Hong and its role as a driving force behind China's newly emerging shadow banking sector. It concludes with a policy recommendation and its implication for China's continued economic development. © Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The SME {{sector in}} Italy was {{hit hard by}} the global {{recession}} of 2008 - 09, as the whole Italian economy which hasn’t yet recovered the 2008 level of GDP. Small enterprises, which constitute {{the vast majority of}} Italian companies, were more affected than medium and large-sized companies. For facing that situation Italian government issued some provisions to improve the general framework conditions for Italian SMEs (Small and Medium enterprises), making administration more responsive to the needs of businesses and improving policies for companies which want aggregate and internationalize theirs activities. Nevertheless, the country’s overall performance of SMEs continues to be below the EU average in terms of exporting internationally and the single market, and access to finance. To cope with this problem Italian legislator has introduced amendments to the law on bonds and financing bills with the aim of facilitating access to direct financing for unlisted companies, especially for SMEs. Until now this new possibilities didn´t {{have a significant impact on}} the finances of Italian SMEs, in fact just twenty-six new instruments have been issued, for a total amount of just under € 5 billion. So, the new measures have generated a substantial flow of capital. Last regulation on this topic was the “Destinazione Italia” Decree which contains in section 12 the legal framework for Italian corporate bonds, offering tax credit both for issuer and purchaser of <b>mini-bond.</b> Insurance companies and pension funds are now incentivized to purchase corporate bonds as those regulatory impediments that used to prevent them from investing have now been lifted. To purchase these bonds with competitive interest rate issuers should have a good credit rating. Only because of the availability of clear, internationally accepted indicators of the risk of default were investors willing to invest in such securities. This lead to the importance of credit rating, their fairness and about the liability of credit rating agency...|$|E
