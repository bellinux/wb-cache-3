40|$|Mitochondrial {{regulation}} of apoptosis {{depends on the}} programmed release of proapoptotic proteins such as cytochrome c (Cyt c) through the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). Although a few key processes involved in this release have been identified, including the liberation of inner membrane-bound Cyt c and formation of diffusible pores on the OMM, other details like the transport of Cyt c within complex mitochondrial compartments, e. g., the cristae and crista junctions, are not yet fully understood (to our knowledge). In particular, a remodeling of the inner mitochondrial membrane accompanying apoptosis seen in a few studies, in which crista junctions widen, has been hypothesized to be a necessary step in the Cyt c release. Using a three-dimensional spatial modeling of <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>crista</b> and the crista junction, model simulations and analysis illustrated how the interplay among solubilization of Cyt c, fast diffusion of Cyt c, and OMM permeabilization {{gives rise to the}} observed experimental release profile. Importantly, the widening of the crista junction was found to have a negligible effect on the transport of free Cyt c from cristae. Finally, model simulations showed that increasing the fraction of free/loosely-bound Cyt c can sensitize the cell to apoptotic stimuli in a threshold manner, which may explain increased sensitivity to cell death associated with aging...|$|E
40|$|Compartmentalization of kinases and phosphatases {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the specificity of second messenger mediated signaling events. Localization of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase is mediated by interaction of its regulatory subunit (PKA-R) with the versatile family of A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). Most AKAPs bind avidly to PKA-RII, while some have dual specificity for both PKA-RI and PKA-RII, however, no mammalian PKA-RI specific AKAPs have thus far been assigned. This was mainly attributed to the observation that PKA-RI is more cytosolic, as compared to the more heavily compartmentalized PKA-RII. Chemical proteomics screens of the cAMP interactome in mammalian heart tissue recently identified sphingosine kinase type 1 -interacting protein (SKIP, SPHKAP) as a putative novel AKAP. Biochemical characterization now shows that SPHKAP can be considered as the first mammalian AKAP that preferentially binds to PKA-RIα. Recombinant human SPHKAP functions as an RI-specific AKAP that utilizes the for AKAPs characteristic amphipathic helix for interaction. Further chemical proteomic screening utilizing differential binding characteristics of specific cAMP-resins confirms SPHKAPs endogenous specificity for PKA-RI directly in mammalian heart and spleen tissue. Alignment of SPHKAPs amphipathic helix with peptide models of PKA-RI or PKA-RII specific anchoring domains shows that it has largely only PKA-RIα characteristics. To further investigate the role of the protein, we combined subcellular fractionation, confocal microscopy and LC-MS/MS analysis to study its subcellular localization and exact molecular environment. We found that SPHKAP localizes to the cytoplasm as well as to the mitochondrial inner membrane space and matrix. Here, it colocalizes with PKA-RIα and associates with a mitochondrial inner membrane organizing system (MINOS) complex that is responsible for maintaining crista structure. Additionally, SPHKAP associates with apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and the phosphatase PGAM 5. We found that the protein N-terminus is required for its mitochondrial localization and overexpression of SPHKAP results in abnormal mitochondria. We show that SPHKAP is a substrate of PKA and that phosphorylation regulates the interaction between SPHKAP and AIF upon cAMP and apoptosis stimulation. Sequence analysis revealed that SPHKAP contains a 13 -amino acid motif similar to the BH 3 domain present in BCL- 2 family proteins. As with other BH 3 -only proteins, co-immunoprecipitation and deletion of BH 3 core amino acids demonstrated that SPHKAP interacts with the anti-apoptotic BCL- 2 and BCL-xL through its BH 3 domain. Taken together, The data suggest a putative role for the mitochondrial SPHKAP-PKA type I complex in regulating <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>crista</b> structure and mitochondrial-mediated apoptosi...|$|E

40|$|The {{demarcation}} of protist kingdoms is reviewed, {{a complete}} revised classification {{down to the}} level of subclass is provided for the kingdoms Protozoa, Archezoa, and Chromista, and the phylogenetic basis of the revised classification is outlined. Removal of Archezoa because of their ancestral absence of mitochondria, peroxisomes, and Golgi dictyosomes makes the kingdom Protozoa much more homogeneous: they all either have mitochondria and peroxisomes or have secondarily lost them. Predominantly phagotrophic, Protozoa are distinguished from the mainly photosynthetic kingdom Chromista (Chlorarachniophyta, Cryptista, Heterokonta, and Haptophyta) by the absence of epiciliary retronemes (rigid thrust-reversing tubular ciliary hairs) and by the lack of two additional membranes outside their chloroplast envelopes. The kingdom Protozoa has two subkingdoms: Adictyozoa, without Golgi dictyosomes, containing only the phylum Percolozoa (flagellates and amoeboflagellates); and Dictyozoa, made up of 17 phyla with Golgi dictyosomes. Dictyozoa are divided into two branches: (i) Parabasalia, a single phylum with hydrogenosomes and 70 S ribosomes but no mitochondria, Golgi dictyosomes associated with striated roots, and a kinetid of four or five cilia; and (ii) Bikonta (16 unicellular or plasmodial phyla with mitochondria and bikinetids and in which Golgi dictyosomes are not associated with striated ciliary roots), which are divided into two infrakingdoms: Euglenozoa (flagellates with discoid <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>cristae</b> and trans-splicing of miniexons for all nuclear genes) and Neozoa (15 phyla of more advanced protozoa with tubular or flat [usually nondiscoid] <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>cristae</b> and cis-spliced spliceosomal introns).

Here we present the Arabidopsis fiona mutant, which forms a female gametophyte that is structurally and functionally {{reminiscent of a}} phylogenetic distant female gametophyte. The respective changes include a modified reproductive behavior {{of one of the}} female germ cells (central cell) and an extended lifespan of three adjacent accessory cells (antipodals). FIONA encodes the cysteinyl t-RNA synthetase SYCO ARATH (SYCO), which is expressed and required in the central cell but not in the antipodals, suggesting that antipodal lifespan is controlled by the adjacent gamete. SYCO localizes to the mitochondria, and ultrastructural analysis of mutant central cells revealed that the protein is necessary for <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>cristae</b> integrity. Furthermore, a dominant ATP/ADP translocator caused <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>cristae</b> degeneration and extended antipodal lifespan when expressed in the central cell of wild-type plants.

40|$|Mitochondria {{are complex}} organelles {{with a highly}} dynamic {{distribution}} and internal organization. Here, we demonstrate that mitofilin, a previously identified mitochondrial protein of unknown function, controls <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>cristae</b> morphology. Mitofilin is enriched in the narrow space between the inner boundary and the outer membranes, where it forms a homotypic interaction and assembles into a large multimeric protein complex. Down-regulation of mitofilin in HeLa cells by using specific small interfering RNA lead to decreased cellular proliferation and increased apoptosis, suggesting abnormal mitochondrial function. Although gross mitochondrial fission and fusion seemed normal, ultrastructural studies revealed disorganized mitochondrial inner membrane. Inner membranes failed to form tubular or vesicular cristae and showed as closely packed stacks of membrane sheets that fused intermittently, resulting in a complex maze of membranous network. Electron microscopic tomography estimated {{a substantial increase in}} inner:outer membrane ratio, whereas no cristae junctions were detected. In addition, mitochondria subsequently exhibited increased reactive oxygen species production and membrane potential.

40|$|Mitochondria are the {{respiratory}} organelles of eukaryotes and their evolutionary history is deeply intertwined {{with that of}} eukaryotes. The compartmentalization of respiration in mitochondria occurs within cristae, whose evolutionary origin has remained unclear. Recent discoveries, however, have revived the old notion that <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>cristae</b> {{could have had a}} pre-endosymbiotic origin. <b>Mitochondrial</b> <b>cristae</b> are likely homologous to the intracytoplasmic membranes (ICMs) used by diverse alphaproteobacteria for harnessing energy. Because the Mitochondrial Contact site and Cristae Organizing System (MICOS) that controls the development of cristae evolved from a simplified version that is phylogenetically restricted to Alphaproteobacteria (alphaMICOS), ICMs most probably transformed into cristae during the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria. This inference is supported by the sequence and structural similarities between MICOS and alphaMICOS, and the expression pattern and cellular localization of alphaMICOS. Given that cristae and ICMs develop similarly, alphaMICOS likely functions analogously to mitochondrial MICOS by culminating ICM development with the creation of tubular connections and membrane contact sites at the alphaproteobacterial envelope. Mitochondria thus inherited a pre-existing ultrastructure adapted to efficient energy transduction from their alphaproteobacterial ancestors.

We show that MIC 13 is an inner membrane protein physically interacting with MIC 60, a central subunit of the MICOS complex. Using the CRISPR/Cas method we generated the first cell line deleted for MIC 13. These knockout cells show a complete loss of crista junctions demonstrating that MIC 13 is strictly required for the formation of crista junctions. MIC 13 is required for the assembly of MIC 10, MIC 26, and MIC 27 into the MICOS complex.
