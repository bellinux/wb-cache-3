5|$|In 2006 Shearer {{appeared}} with Brian Hayes in four episodes of the BBC Radio 4 sitcom Not Today, Thank You, playing Nostrils, a <b>man</b> <b>so</b> ugly he cannot {{stand to be}} in his own presence. He was originally scheduled to appear in all six episodes but had to withdraw from recording two due to a problem with his work permit. On June 19, 2008, it was announced that Shearer would receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the radio category. The date of the ceremony where his star will be put in place has yet to be announced.|$|E
5|$|Many {{other of}} the endemic species of Rodrigues became extinct after the arrival of <b>man,</b> <b>so</b> the {{ecosystem}} of the island is heavily damaged. Before humans arrived, forests covered the island entirely, but very little remains today due to deforestation. The Rodrigues solitaire lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the Rodrigues rail, the Rodrigues parrot, Newton's parakeet, the Rodrigues starling, the Rodrigues owl, the Rodrigues night heron, and the Rodrigues pigeon. Extinct reptiles include the domed Rodrigues giant tortoise, the saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise, and the Rodrigues day gecko.|$|E
5|$|On 21 May 1887, two new {{buildings}} were completed {{at the hospital}} and the Prince and Princess of Wales came to open them officially. Princess Alexandra wished to meet the Elephant <b>Man,</b> <b>so</b> after a tour of the hospital, the royal party went to his rooms for an introduction. The princess shook Merrick's hand and sat with him, an experience that left him overjoyed. She gave him a signed photograph of herself, which became a prized possession, and she sent him a Christmas card each year.|$|E

5|$|The early {{settlers}} in New Zealand cleared {{the bush and}} found their newly planted crops were invaded by hordes of caterpillars and other insects deprived of their previous food sources. Native birds were not habituated to living {{in close proximity to}} <b>man</b> <b>so</b> the common starling was introduced from Europe along with the House Sparrow to control the pests. It was first brought over in 1862 by the Nelson Acclimatisation Society and other introductions followed. The birds soon became established and are now found all over the country including the subtropical Kermadec Islands to the north and the equally distant Macquarie Island far to the south.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most of his}} noble relatives, John {{opposed the}} tyrannical regime of Andronikos I Komnenos (r. 1182–85), and {{had been forced to}} sign written pledge of loyalty to the emperor. Nevertheless, on 11 September 1185, when his nephew Isaac Angelos killed Andronikos I's chief henchman, Stephen Hagiochristophorites, and sought {{sanctuary}} in the Hagia Sophia cathedral, John and his eldest son Isaac rushed to his side, fearing the Emperor's retribution. By the next day, a popular uprising provoked by Isaac Angelos' act of defiance had brought down the regime of Andronikos I, but Isaac Angelos hesitated to be crowned emperor. According to Niketas Choniates and Theodore Skoutariotes, John then bared his own head and offered his own bald head to be crowned, but the assembled people violently opposed this, refusing to be ruled by a <b>man</b> <b>so</b> old after the equally elderly Andronikos I, and Isaac Angelos was crowned.|$|E
5|$|Many other {{endemic species}} of Mauritius were lost after {{the arrival of}} <b>man,</b> <b>so</b> the {{ecosystem}} of the island is severely damaged and hard to reconstruct. Before humans arrived, Mauritius was entirely covered in forests, almost {{all of which have}} since been lost to deforestation. The surviving endemic fauna is still seriously threatened. The broad-billed parrot lived alongside other recently extinct Mauritian birds such as the dodo, the red rail, the Mascarene grey parakeet, the Mauritius blue pigeon, the Mauritius owl, the Mascarene coot, the Mauritian shelduck, the Mauritian duck, and the Mauritius night heron. Extinct Mauritian reptiles include the saddle-backed Mauritius giant tortoise, the domed Mauritius giant tortoise, the Mauritian giant skink, and the Round Island burrowing boa. The small Mauritian flying fox and the snail Tropidophora carinata lived on Mauritius and Réunion but became extinct in both islands. Some plants, such as Casearia tinifolia and the palm orchid, have also become extinct.|$|E

25|$|Riley B. King {{was born}} on September 16, 1925, on a cotton {{plantation}} called Berclair, {{near the town of}} Itta Bena, Mississippi, the son of sharecroppers Albert and Nora Ella King. He considered the nearby city of Indianola, Mississippi to be his home. When Riley was four years old, his mother left his father for another <b>man,</b> <b>so</b> he was raised by his maternal grandmother, Elnora Farr, in Kilmichael, Mississippi.|$|E

25|$|To {{understand}} what happens, {{consider the following}} analogy. Someone throws one ball every second at a man. Assume that balls travel with constant velocity. If the thrower is stationary, the man will receive one ball every second. However, if the thrower is moving towards the man, he will receive balls more frequently because the balls will be less spaced out. The inverse is true if the thrower is {{moving away from the}} <b>man.</b> <b>So</b> it is actually the wavelength which is affected; as a consequence, the received frequency is also affected. It may also be said that the velocity of the wave remains constant whereas wavelength changes; hence frequency also changes.|$|E
25|$|The name Abbeville {{has been}} adopted to name a {{category}} of paleolithic stone tools. These stone tools are also known as handaxes. Various handaxes were found near Abbeville by Jacques Boucher de Perthes starting in 1838 {{and he was the}} first to describe the stones in detail, pointing out in the first publication of its kind, in 1846, that the stones were chipped deliberately by early <b>man,</b> <b>so</b> as to form a tool. These stone tools which are some of the earliest found in Europe, were chipped on both sides so as to form a sharp edge, were known as Abbevillian handaxes or bifaces, but recently the term 'abevillian' is becoming obsolete as the earlier form of stone tool, not found in Europe, is known as the Oldowan chopper. Some of these artifacts are displayed at the Musee Boucher-de-Perthes.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the naval}} {{support for the}} LCAs {{approaching}} Bark South were LCS(M)s to provide supporting fire during their approach to the beaches. The naval plan worked adequately, with few exceptions, {{and there was no}} enemy air or sea interdiction. The Mediterranean was rough, however, and most of troops travelling in LCAs suffered sea-sickness, one <b>man</b> <b>so</b> much so that he died. Some worry plagued planners regarding LCAs swamping in the heavy surf at the shoreline, but the crews touched down and retracted their craft without serious difficulty. Anxious minutes passed at the Red and Green waiting positions, as by zero hour, when the assault wave of LCAs had beached, many of the LCIs and most of the LCTs had not arrived. This was largely due to the rough sea which, though inconvenient for landing ships carrying LCAs, had considerably reduced the distances landing craft could cover.|$|E

25|$|These {{performances}} {{were enough to}} ensure that Burge was recalled for the 1965-66 Ashes series in what was his final international campaign. In the First Test, his final appearance for Australia in Brisbane, he made a duck in his only innings of a drawn match. He then made his fourth and final Test century, 120 in the second innings of the Second Test in Melbourne, helping Australia to make 426 and avoid a defeat after conceding a 200-run lead on the first innings. He then made 6 and 1 as Australia were crushed by an innings in the Third Test before scoring 27 as Australia reversed the result in the next match. This was his last Test, as {{on the eve of}} the Fifth Test, he announced that he would not make the 1966-67 tour to South Africa and was subsequently relegated to 12th <b>man</b> <b>so</b> that other players could get international experience, ending his Test career. He had made 159 runs at 26.50 for the series.|$|E

The thirteenth–fourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann, on the other hand, gives Gofraid's patronym as [...] "... filius Haraldi nigri de Ysland". Whilst the former source identifies Gofraid as the son of a man named Aralt (Old Norse Haraldr), the latter identifies Gofraid as the paternal grandson of a <b>man</b> <b>so</b> named.|$|E
