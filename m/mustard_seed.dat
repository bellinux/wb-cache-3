25|$|The first books {{illustrated}} with colored woodcuts appeared around this time; as color-printing techniques were perfected, illustrated manuals {{on the art}} of painting began to be published. Jieziyuan Huazhuan (Manual of the <b>Mustard</b> <b>Seed</b> Garden), a five-volume work first published in 1679, has been in use as a technical textbook for artists and students ever since.|$|E
5000|$|The term hot mustard is {{used for}} mustards {{prepared}} {{to bring out the}} natural piquancy of the <b>mustard</b> <b>seeds.</b> [...] This is enhanced by using pungent black or brown <b>mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> rather than the white <b>mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> used to make mild mustards.|$|R
50|$|Mustard grows well in {{temperate}} regions. Major {{producers of}} <b>mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> include India, Pakistan, Canada, Nepal, Hungary, Great Britain and the United States. Brown and black <b>mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> return higher yields than their yellow counterparts.|$|R

40|$|A {{total number}} of 54 male growing New Zealand rabbits were used to study the effect of two {{different}} levels of ration protein supplemented with <b>Mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> (Sinapis alba Linn). Rabbits were classified into six equal groups (G 1 -G 6). The 1 st and 4 th groups received basal ration with 100 % and 90 % protein requirement and served as first and second control respectively. The 2 nd and the 3 rd groups received basal ration with 100 % protein requirement supplemented with Sinapisalba Linn {{at the level of}} 0. 5 and 1. 0 %, respectively. The 5 th and 6 th groups received basal ration with 90 % protein requirement with Sinapisalba Linn at the level of 0. 5 and 1. 0 %, respectively. The low level of protein (90 % of protein requirement containing diet) significantly increased (P 6) showed the best digestion coefficients of DM, OM, CP, EE and NFE and TDN value. However, the 100 % of protein requirement with 1 % <b>mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> containing diet (G 3) showed the high value of DCP. Inclusion <b>Mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> at 1 % in rabbit diets significantly (P< 0. 05) increased all nutrient digestibility and nutritive values compared to control diet. Inclusion <b>Mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> at 0. 5 % significantly (P< 0. 05) increased the DM and EE digestibility and total digestible nutrient compared to control diet. The interaction between the protein and <b>mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> levels significantly (P< 0. 05) increased the all nutrient digestibility coefficients (DM, OM, CP, CF, EE and NFE) and nutritive values (TDN and DCP). Inclusion <b>Mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> at 0. 5 % or 1 % significantly (P< 0. 05) improved the final or weight, total body weight gain, average daily gain and feed conversion compared to control diet. On the other hand inclusion of <b>Mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> at 1 % significantly (P< 0. 05) increased the total body weight gain and average daily gain by 24. 3 % while at 0. 5 % significantly (P< 0. 05) increased the total body weight gain and average daily gain by 14. 5 % compared to the control group. The 90 % of protein with 1 % <b>mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> recorded the best values of final weight, total body weight gain, average daily gain and feed conversion. The interaction between the protein and <b>mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> levels significantly (P< 0. 05) increased the final weight, weight gain, average daily gain and feed conversion. Inclusion <b>mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> in rabbit diets clearly decreased the dressing percentages by increasing the level of <b>mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> in rabbit diets. Dietary 90 % of protein requirements with 0. 5 % or 1 % <b>mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> showed the higher value ofnet revenue, economical efficiency and relative economic efficiency, as well as the lower value of feed cost/ kg live body weight (LE). </p...|$|R

25|$|The most {{important}} crop in Tibet is barley, and dough made from barley flour—called tsampa—is the staple food of Tibet. This is either rolled into noodles or made into steamed dumplings called momos. Meat dishes {{are likely to}} be yak, goat, or mutton, often dried, or cooked into a spicy stew with potatoes. <b>Mustard</b> <b>seed</b> is cultivated in Tibet, and therefore features heavily in its cuisine. Yak yogurt, butter and cheese are frequently eaten, and well-prepared yogurt is considered something of a prestige item. Butter tea is very popular to drink.|$|E
25|$|However, {{low income}} {{residents}} still {{make up a}} large proportion of the population (28.3% in 2001). The <b>Mustard</b> <b>Seed</b> Calgary is located in the Beltline at 102 11 Ave SE. There are also many poorly maintained and dilapidated buildings with low rents. A large portion of Victoria Park, in particular, is in poor condition due to the city's decision to restrict development on lands needed for Calgary Stampede expansion Owners of this land were generally not interested in improving buildings they knew would be removed soon. As a result, a number of seemingly abandoned buildings were occupied illegally by squatters. As the city has finalized land purchases and made final decisions on land use, this has decreased dramatically.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} and frequently used spices and flavourings in Indian cuisine are whole or powdered chilli pepper (mirch, introduced by the Portuguese from Mexico in the 16th century), black <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> (sarso), cardamom (elaichi), cumin (jeera), turmeric (haldi), asafoetida (hing), ginger (adrak), coriander (dhania), and garlic (lasoon). One popular spice mix is garam masala, a powder that typically includes five or more dried spices, especially cardamom, cinnamon (dalchini), and clove (laung). Each culinary region has a distinctive garam masala blend—individual chefs may also have their own. Goda masala is a comparable, though sweet, spice mix popular in Maharashtra. Some leaves commonly used for flavouring include bay leaves (tejpat), coriander leaves, fenugreek leaves, and mint leaves. The use of curry leaves and roots for flavouring is typical of Gujarati and South Indian cuisine. Sweet dishes are often seasoned with cardamom, saffron, nutmeg, and rose petal essences.|$|E
50|$|Argemone mexicana (family Papaveraceae), {{a native}} of West Indies and {{naturalized}} in India, is known as “Shailkanta” in Bengal and “Bharbhanda” in Uttar Pradesh. It is also popularly known as “Pivladhatura” or “Satyanashi”, meaning devastating. The plant grows wildly in mustard and other fields. Its seeds are black in colour and {{are similar to the}} dark coloured <b>mustards</b> <b>seeds</b> (Brassica juncea) in shape and size.

Two Indian forest tribes, the Baiga and the Bharia of Madhya Pradesh, have been reported to use the fruit bodies medicinally. The spore mass is blended with <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> oil, and used as a salve against burns.

500|$|The females {{lay their}} eggs in November or December. The eggs are round, {{about the size of}} a <b>mustard</b> <b>seed,</b> and are a transparent, purply red. They are held {{together}} in a cream-coloured, round, ball shaped egg sac which is about [...] in diameter. The female constructs five or six egg sacs over the next three to four weeks. Each egg sac contains about 70 to 90 fertilised eggs. The egg sacs are hung in the centre of the spiders web and the female spins more silk over them. Over time the exterior of the egg sac may become covered with sand. After six weeks of incubation, during January and February, the spiderlings hatch. The young spiders then disperse from the web. At present, little is known about the dispersal mechanism that the spiderlings use to move away from the nest. In one study, observing spiders over 24 hours, 28% used a ballooning method, which is where the young spiders use heat currents to carry themselves away from the nest suspended by a single web strand. While the majority, 61%, used a bridging method where the spiderling uses its silk to move to nearby plants, and 11% still remained in the nest. The young spiderlings reach full maturity the following spring.|$|E

2500|$|Historically, Saskatchewan's {{economy was}} {{primarily}} associated with agriculture. However, increasing diversification {{has resulted in}} agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting only making up 6.8% of the province's GDP. Saskatchewan grows {{a large portion of}} Canada's grain. Wheat is the most familiar crop and the one most often associated with the province (there are sheafs of wheat depicted on the coat of arms of Saskatchewan), but other grains like canola, flax, rye, oats, peas, lentils, canary seed, and barley are also produced. Saskatchewan is the world's largest exporter of <b>mustard</b> <b>seed.</b> [...] Beef cattle production by a Canadian province is only exceeded by Alberta.

2500|$|Two {{species of}} whale were hunted in {{southern}} Labrador, the North Atlantic right whale and the bowhead whale. The former were {{taken during the}} [...] "early" [...] season in the summer, while the latter was caught from the fall to early winter (October–January). DNA analysis of the old bones after a comprehensive search of Basque whaling ports from the 16th to the 17th century, in the Strait of Belle Isle and Gulf of St. Lawrence found that the right whale was by then less than 1% of the whales taken. During the peak of Terranova whaling (1560s–1580s) the Spanish Basques used well-armed galleons of up to 600–700 tons, while the French Basques usually fitted out smaller vessels. A 450-ton Basque ship carrying 100 or more men required about 300 hogsheads of cider and wine and 300–400 quintals of ship's biscuit, {{as well as other}} dry provisions. In Labrador the men subsisted mainly on locally caught cod and salmon, as well as the occasional caribou or wild duck. This diet was supplemented with dried peas, beans, chickpeas, olive oil, <b>mustard</b> <b>seed,</b> and bacon. Before leaving for Terranova sometime in the months of May or June, a priest went aboard the ships to bless them and say a special mass for the success of the expeditions. Sailing across the stormy North Atlantic must have been a very unpleasant experience for the crew of up to 130 men and boys, as they slept on the hard decks or filthy, vermin-invested straw palliasses. Halfway there the smell of refuse in the bilge would have been unbearable. After a voyage of two months the ships would anchor in one of the twelve harbors on the southern shore of Labrador and eastern Quebec. Archaeological evidence has been found for ten of these harbors – Middle Bay and Blanc-Sablon in Quebec, and Schooner Cove, West St. Modeste, East St. Modeste, Carrol Cove, Red Bay, Chateau Bay, Pleasure Harbour, and Cape Charles in southern Labrador. Once the ice had disappeared the ships entered the harbors where the coopers went ashore and erected their dwellings and workshops, while most of the crew lived aboard ship. The boys were also sent ashore to chop wood and prepare meals.|$|E
