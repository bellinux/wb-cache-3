Ammo; resource satchels, pouches, and quivers; resistance, antidote, and health potions; and traps are all amenable to crafting. Weapons have modification slots for dealing more damage. A small head piece that Aloy wears called a Focus allows her to scan machines to determine their susceptibilities, identify their location, the particular level they possess, and the nature of loot they will drop. One machine, the Stalker, can enable cloaking technology as a means of averting the gaze of Aloy's Focus scan.|$|E

The machining system {{sets the}} limitations of dimensionalaccuracy and surface quality of a <b>machined</b> <b>component.</b> The capabilityof the machining system describes these limits in terms of specifiedvalues. This thesis deals with machining system capability analysismainly focused on machine tool static and dynamic stiffness. The influence of stiffness and flexibility on machining systemcapability is analytically and experimentally investigated. Theexperimental work presented in the thesis complies with the theoriesand shows the relation between machine tool capability and theoutcome on the <b>machine</b> <b>component.</b> The concept of capability analysis by elastic linked system andthe currently available tools for such an evaluation is presented anddiscussed. The basis of elastic linked system analysis is the use ofmeasurements under loaded condition. The machine tool is loadedwith a known force creating a test condition closer to real machining,compared to current methods of unloaded machine tools. Twomeasurement tools for elastic linked system capability analysis areexplained in the thesis: Loaded Double Ball Bar and ContactlessExcitation and Response System. The thesis consists of an analytical base and an experimental casestudy on spiral bevel gear face milling. The experiments are discussedand compiled with the given theories. QC 20130513 </p...|$|R

Today pre-production {{in general is}} characterized by low level of formalization of relationships and connections, forming in it. Formal quantitative evaluations, allowing effective evaluation and implementation of portability (similarity) of design decisions are. poorly used. Research, aimed on revealing and using for pre-production efficiency the upgrading of relations and quantitative formal estimations of the structural and technological design decisions similarity, is quite actual. Presented work demonstrates scientific-methodical approach to determining and using for <b>machines</b> <b>components</b> pre-production of quantitative estimations of the structural and technological design decisions similarity {{on the basis of}} the components models decomposition to complexes of surfaces, united by forms forming technologies similarity. We have found stable relations between quantitative estimations of the structural and technological similarity of the compared components.
