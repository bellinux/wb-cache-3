Suess {{pointed out}} that the gravel-size <b>moldavites</b> {{exhibited}} curious pittings and wrinkles on the surface, which could not be due to the action of water, but resembled the characteristic markings on many meteorites. Boldly attributing the material to a cosmic origin, he regarded <b>moldavites</b> as a special type of meteorite for which he proposed the name of tektite. However, for a long time, it was generally believed to be a variety of obsidian. Because of their difficult fusibility, extremely low water content, and its chemical composition, the current overwhelming consensus among earth scientists is that <b>moldavites</b> were formed about 14.7 million years ago during the impact of a giant meteorite in present-day Nördlinger Ries. Splatters of material that was melted by the impact cooled while they were actually airborne and most fell in Bohemia. Currently, <b>moldavites</b> have been found in an area that includes southern Bohemia, western Moravia, the Cheb Basin (northwest Bohemia), Lusatia (Germany), and Waldviertel (Austria). Isotope analysis of samples of <b>moldavites</b> have shown a beryllium-10 isotope composition similar to the composition of Australasian tektites (australites) and Ivory Coast tektites (ivorites).

40|$|SUMMARY. The volatilities of SiO~, Na~O, and Fe~Oa x {{increase}} with increasing thermal function {{within the range}} 1600 to 2100 ~ during the melting of a sandy-silty clay. The remaining melt is to some extent enriched in Al~O 3, K,O, CaO, and MgO. Chemical analyses of the sandy-silty clay, of the glasses melted from the latter, of the silicate material evaporated and newly condensed and their correlation with increasing thermal function and bulk density of glasses, {{as well as with}} the hitherto known quantitative data on <b>moldavites,</b> testify to the fact that in <b>moldavites</b> evaporated and newly condensed silicate material substantially prevails over material that passed irectly from a solid to a fluid state. Evaporation of the silicate material from the rocks of the impact crater caused asignificant change in relations between major oxides compared to the original relations in the source rocks. Thus, the hypothesis that tektites are directly remelted rocks of the Earth's crust, based on over-all chemical similarities of tektites and some rocks in major oxides, appears incorrect. MOLDAVITES are inhomogeneous silicate glasses belonging to tektites; they occur in southern Bohemia and Moravia, Czechoslovakia.

Similar agreements exist between tektites from the North American strewnfield and the Chesapeake Bay impact crater and between tektites from the Ivory Coast strewnfield and the Lake Bosumtwi Crater. Ages of tektites have usually been determined by either the K-Ar method, fission-track dating, the Ar-Ar technique, or combination of these techniques.|$|R
40|$|Sm-Nd and Rb-Sr {{analyses}} of tektites and other impactites {{can be used}} to place constraints on the age and provenance of target materials which were impact melted to form these objects. Tektites have large negative ε^(Nd) (0) values and are uniform within each tektite group while the ε^(Sr) (0) are large positive values and show considerable variation within each group. Chemical, trace element, and isotopic compositions of tektites are consistent with production by melting of sediments derived from old terrestrial continental crust. Each tektite group is characterized by a uniform Nd model age, T_(CHUR) ^(Nd), interpreted as the time of formation of the crustal segment which weathered to form the parent sediment for the tektites: (1) ∼ 1. 15 AE for Australasian tektites; (2) ∼ 1. 91 AE for Ivory Coast tektites; (3) ∼ 0. 9 AE for moldavites; (4) ∼ 0. 65 AE for North American tektites, and (5) ∼ 0. 9 AE for high-Si irghizites. Sr model ages, T_(UR) ^(Sr), are variable within each group reflecting Rb-Sr fractionation and in the favorable limit of very high Rb/Sr ratios, approach the time of sedimentation of the parent material which melted to form the tektites. Australasian tektites are derived from ∼ 0. 25 AE sediments, <b>moldavites</b> from ∼ 0. 0 AE sediments, Ivory Coast tektites from ∼ 0. 95 AE sediments. Possible parent sediments of other tektite groups have poorly constrained ages. Our data on <b>moldavites</b> and Ivory Coast tektites are consistent with derivation from the Ries and Bosumtwi craters, respectively. Irghizites are isotopically distinct from Australasian tektites and are probably not related. Sanidine spherules from a Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary clay have initial ε^(Nd) ∼ + 2; ε^(Sr) ∼ + 5 and are not derived from old continental crust or meteoritic feldspar. They may represent a mixture of basaltic oceanic crust and sediments, implying an oceanic impact. These isotopic results are also consistent with a volcanic origin for the spherules...|$|R
40|$|Attention {{is given}} to the light which may be shed by the ejecta {{surrounding}} the 26 -km diameter Ries Crater in West Germany on the Cretaceous-Tertiary Boundary Event. <b>Moldavites</b> represent early high speed ejecta originating at the projectile-target interface.

Suevite is deposited last, and is derived from the deepest target stratum. Using various scaling laws that relate the bolide's kinetic energy to crater geometry or volume, and assuming a 25 km/sec impact velocity, a 1 - 2 km projectile diameter is obtained for a stony object. Geochemical studies reveal that projectile dissemination is heterogeneous, and that maximum extraterrestrial contamination modeled as a C 1 chondrite is 0. 004 wt pct.

The colour of Moravian moldavites usually differs from their Bohemian counterparts, as {{it tends to be}} brownish. Taking into account the number of pieces found, Moravian localities are considerably less productive than the Bohemian ones; however, the average weight of the moldavites found is much higher. The oldest (primary) moldavite-bearing sediments lie between Slavice and Třebíč. The majority of other localities in southern Moravia are associated with sediments of Miocene as well as Pleistocene rivers that flowed across this area more or less to the southeast, similar to the present streams of Jihlava, Oslava and Jevišovka.|$|E

Various tektite groupings based on chemical composition and geographic occurrence all show a systematic increase in O^(18) with decreasing SiO_ 2 content, similar to that previously found for the bediasites. These systematic correlations must arise either by (1) vapor fractionation of tektite material during impact melting or (2) mixing of a SiO_ 2 -rich igneous component and a low-SiO_ 2 component formed {{at a much lower}} temperature; perhaps the mixing occurred during weathering at the earth's surface or during hydrothermal alteration of silicic igneous rocks either on the earth or the moon...|$|R
40|$|Oxygen isotope {{studies of}} tektites and impact glasses provide an {{important}} tool to help in identifying the target lithologies for terrestrial impacts, including the K-T boundary impact. However, such studies may be complicated by modification of the original oxygen isotope values of some source rocks during the tektite formation process either by vapor fractionation or incorporation of meteoric water. To further investigate {{the relationship between the}} oxygen isotopic composition of tektites and their source rocks, Ivory Coast tektites and samples of impact glasses and bedrock lithologies from the Bosumtwi Crater in Ghana [...] which is widely believed to be the source crater for the Ivory Coast tektites [...] were studied. Our preliminary results suggest that the phyllites and metagraywackes from the Bosumtwi Crater were the predominant source materials for the impact glasses and tektites and that no significant oxygen isotope modification (less than 1 percent delta(O- 18)) took place during impact melting. This contrasts with previous studies of <b>moldavites</b> and Australasian tektites and their sedimentary source materials which suggests a 4 to 5 percent lowering of delta(O- 18) due to meteoric water incorporation during impact melting...|$|R
40|$|In 1914 the <b>moldavites,</b> australites and billitonites {{had already}} been known {{for many years and}} the queenstownites had just been {{discovered}} and recognised as tektites. In this year A. Eppler communicated that he had received a sphere of obsidian, ± 17 mm in diameter from South America, the place of origin not being known. Both according to his opinion and to that of Professor Weinschenk, it should be ascribed to the tektites. He arrived at this conclusion mainly by the external appearance of the pebble, that showed the same sculpture and lustre as that of most tektites. Otherwise, however, it had a marked resemblance to the terrestrial obsidian. Eppler compared his tektite to South American obsidians and found them to possess the same brownish grey colour in transmitted light, the same refractive index and practically the same specific gravity (the tektite 2. 352, the obsidian 2. 346).

The distribution area of these glasses and their close macroscopic similarity (apart from the spherules) with <b>moldavite</b> suggested us that they may shed new light {{on the nature of the}} binary asteroid which caused the Steinheim-Ries impact craters. However, our petrographic and chemical data rule out an extra-terrestrial origin. Metallographic microstructure, lack of Ni and high P contents (up to 9 wt. %) reveal the metallic inclusions as cast iron spherules. The chemical composition of the host glass consistently differs from both <b>moldavite</b> and suevite compositions.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{detailed}} geological, petrographic, geochemical, and geographical information we have performed a numerical modeling study of three related and coeval impact features: The Steinheim crater (apparent diameter Da = 3. 8 km), the Ries crater (Da = 24 km) in Southern Germany, and the <b>moldavite</b> (tektite) strewn field in Bohemia and Moravia (Czech Republic), Lusatia (East Germany), and Lower Austria. The <b>moldavite</b> strewn field extends from about 200 km to 450 km away from {{the centre of the}} Ries to the ENE forming a fan with an angle of about 57 °. According to this modeling work, an oblique impact of a binary asteroid from a WSW direction appears to be a reasonable working hypothesis to explain the setting of the craters and the formation and distribution of the moldavites. We carried out a series of 3 D hydrocode simulations of a Ries-type impact. The results confirm previous results indicating 30 ° from the horizon as the most probable angle for near surface melting, and, consequently for the formation of tektites. Finally, the simulation of the motion of impact-produced tektite particles through the atmosphere produces a narrow-angle, downrange, distant distribution of the <b>moldavite</b> tektites in a fan-like field with an angle of about 75 °. Although the calculated distribution still deviates to some degree from the known distribution of the moldavites, our results represent an important step toward {{a better understanding of the}} origin and distribution of the high-velocity surface melt (tektites) and the low-velocity, deep-seated melt (coherent clast-laden melt) resulting from an oblique impact on a stratified target...|$|E
40|$|Asteroid or cometary impacts {{onto the}} Earth surface {{are known to}} have played an {{important}} role in modifying the composition of the earth crust. Impact glasses, resulting from the rapid cooling of the molten target rock, are clues of the complex melting and metamorphic processes taking place during an impact. Tektites and micro-tektites are a sub class of impact glasses formed during the very first stages of the cratering process by high temperature melting of the target rock. They usually display rounded shapes and can be found over wide areas called strewn fields. As Fe oxidation state could be a useful probe to obtain information on the formation conditions of tektites, it has been the focus of many studies. However, the difficulties in analysing samples with small dimensions and high Fe dilution have so far hindered the possibility to systematically study the Fe oxidation state in these glasses. To this aim, XANES is an ideal technique as it allows to determine the Fe oxidation state also in small samples even at very high dilution without deteriorating the error in the Fe 3 +/(Fe 2 ++Fe 3 +) ratio. Fe K-edge XANES spectra have been collected in fluorescence mode at the ID 26 beamline of ESRF using a Si (311) monochromator focusing the X-ray beam down to about 50 x 200 μm. The excellent energy reproducibility (± 0. 03 eV) allowed to obtain a small error in the determination of the Fe oxidation state. Micro-IR data have been collected in transmission mode at the LNF (Frascati, Italy). Areal analyses (50 x 50 μm) have been collected for 16 <b>moldavites,</b> 7 North American tektites and 5 microtektites. Tektite glasses display Fe 3 +/(Fe 2 ++Fe 3 +) ratios close to 0. 05 (± 0. 03). With few exceptions (<b>moldavites</b> from the Moravian area), no significant variations have been found in the Fe oxidation state of tektite samples according to impact age or target rock composition [1]. Even for very large impacts events, where the target rock presumably displayed a wide range of Fe oxidation states, tektites have been homogeneously reduced to almost exclusively Fe 2 + [2]. Similar behaviour has been observed in molten rock from the first atomic bomb test (Alamogordo, USA) [3]. Contrary to tektites, North American microtektites show a wide variation in the Fe oxidation state raising the issue of a possible difference with the formation mechanism of tektites [4]. Water content of all the tektites and microtektites are in the range of already published tektite water content data and display no correlation with the Fe oxidation state. The low water content of North American microtektites studied suggests that there has been no sea-water induced alteration in these samples, thus strongly suggesting that the variation of the Fe oxidation state in the North American microtektite samples studied here is not due to secondary alteration. We maintain that the mechanism responsible for NA microtektite oxidation is not sea-water alteration, nor oxidation in air. [1] Giuli, G. et al. (2002) Geochim. Cosmochim. Ac., 66, 4347 - 4353.

This locality was partially recultivated in 2010. The aim of this work was to establish which factors do influence different amphibian species in the both studied locations. There were found five various species of amphibians near the village of Slavče: the Common frog (Rana temporaria), the Edible frog (Pelophylax kl. esculentus), the European fire-bellied toad (Bombina bombina), the European tree frog (Hyla arborea) and the Common toad (Bufo bufo). The results were statistically evaluated. Based on them it was established that the Common frog prefers the herb layer, the European Fire-bellied toad prefers semi shaded medium sized pools that do not dry up. The European tree frog and the Edible frog prefer large areas of pools and ponds. More over the edible frog demands ponds that are partially overgrown. The Common toad was represented only with one single individual. Therefore a statistical analasys could not be executed. The whole locality is negatively influenced by local inhabitants who gather here manure and organic waste from their gardens. On locality located near to Dobrkovská Lhotka was transformed from a mining landscape to a pond and three pools.

40|$|International audienceTektites are {{terrestrial}} natural glasses {{produced during}} a hypervelocity impact of an extraterrestrial projectile onto the Earth's surface. The {{similarity between the}} chemical and isotopic compositions of tektites and terrestrial upper continental crust implies that the tektites formed by fusion of such target rock. Tektites are among the driest rocks on Earth. Although volatilization at high temperature may have caused this extreme dryness, the exact mechanism of the water loss and the behavior of other volatile species during tektite formation are still debated. Volatilization can fractionate isotopes, therefore, comparing the isotope composition of volatile elements in tektites with that of their source rocks may help to understand the physical conditions during tektite formation. For this study, we have measured the Zn isotopic composition of 20 tektites from four different strewn fields. Almost all samples are enriched in heavy isotopes of Zn compared to the upper continental crust. On average, the different groups of tektites are isotopically distinct (listed from the isotopically lightest to the heaviest) : Muong-Nong type indochinites (δ 66 / 64 Zn = 0. 61 ± 0. 30 ‰); North American bediasites (δ 66 / 64 Zn = 1. 61 ± 0. 49 ‰); Ivory Coast tektites (δ 66 / 64 Zn = 1. 66 ± 0. 18 ‰); the Australasian tektites (others than the Muong Nong-type indochinites) (δ 66 / 64 Zn = 1. 84 ± 0. 42 ‰); and Central European <b>moldavites</b> (δ 66 / 64 Zn = 2. 04 ± 0. 19 ‰). These results are contrasted with a narrow range of δ 66 / 64 Zn = 0 – 0. 7 ‰ for a diverse spectrum of upper continental crust materials. The elemental abundance of Zn is negatively correlated with δ 66 / 64 Zn, which may reflect that isotopic fractionation occurred by evaporation during the heating event upon tektite formation. Simple Rayleigh distillation predicts isotopic fractionations much larger than what is actually observed, therefore, such a model cannot account for the observed Zn isotope fractionation in tektites. We have developed a more realistic model of evaporation of Zn from a molten sphere: during its hypervelocity trajectory, the molten surface of the tektite will be entrained by viscous coupling with air that will then induce a velocity field inside the molten sphere. This velocity field induces significant radial chemical mixing within the tektite that accelerates the evaporation process. Our model, albeit parameter dependent, shows that both the isotopic composition and the chemical abundances measured in tektites can be produced by evaporation in a diffusion-limited regime...|$|R
