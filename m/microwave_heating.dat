25|$|The {{most heavily}} studied betalain is betanin, also called {{beetroot}} red {{after the fact}} that it may be extracted from red beet roots. Betanin is a glucoside, and hydrolyzes into the sugar glucose and betanidin. It is used as a food coloring agent, and the color is sensitive to pH. Other betalains known to occur in beets are isobetanin, probetanin, and neobetanin. The color and antioxidant capacity of betanin and indicaxanthin (betaxanthin derived of L-proline) are affected by dielectric <b>microwave</b> <b>heating.</b> Addition of TFE (2,2,2-trifluoroethanol) is reported to improve the hydrolytic stability of some betalains in aqueous solution. Furthermore, a betanin-europium(III) complex has been used to detect calcium dipicolinate in bacterial spores, including Bacillus anthracis and B. cereus.|$|E
25|$|Compared to liquid water, <b>microwave</b> <b>heating</b> is less {{efficient}} on fats and sugars (which have a smaller molecular dipole moment). Sugars and triglycerides (fats and oils) absorb microwaves {{due to the}} dipole moments of their hydroxyl groups or ester groups. However, due to the lower specific heat capacity of fats and oils and their higher vaporization temperature, they often attain much higher temperatures inside microwave ovens. This can induce temperatures in oil or very fatty foods like bacon far above the boiling point of water, and high enough to induce some browning reactions, much {{in the manner of}} conventional , braising, or deep fat frying. Foods high in water content and with little oil rarely exceed the boiling temperature of water.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} HNO(3) {{pretreatment}} of activated carbon (AC) -supported copper catalysts for NO removal with NH(3) was studied. In addition, {{the effects of}} various preparation methods for Cu/AC catalysts, namely, impregnation (IM), polyol process (P), and <b>microwave</b> <b>heated</b> polyol process (MP), on the activity of NO removal with NH(3) were compared. HNO(3) pretreatment {{increased the number of}} carboxyl sites and promoted good dispersion of active sites. In addition, the chemical states of active phases were found to be affected when the catalysts were prepared by the <b>microwave</b> <b>heated</b> polyol process. More Cu(2) O particles were observed on the Cu/AC-N-MP catalyst than on the Cu/AC-N-P catalyst. The experimental results indicated that HNO(3) pretreatment of the AC support led to increased catalytic activity for NO removal with NH(3). The catalytic activity of the Cu/AC catalysts for NO removal at 200 degrees C decreased in the following order: Cu/AC-N-MP > Cu/AC-N-P > Cu/AC-N-IM. The <b>microwave</b> <b>heated</b> polyol process is a facile method for the rapid synthesis of carbon-supported Cu catalysts for NO removal at low temperature. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

25|$|<b>Microwave</b> <b>heating</b> can be {{deliberately}} uneven by design. Some microwavable packages (notably pies) {{may include}} materials that contain ceramic or aluminium flakes, which {{are designed to}} absorb microwaves and heat up, which aids in baking or crust preparation by depositing more energy shallowly in these areas. Such ceramic patches affixed to cardboard are positioned next to the food, and are typically smokey blue or gray in colour, usually making them easily identifiable; the cardboard sleeves included with Hot Pockets, which have a silver surface on the inside, are {{a good example of}} such packaging. Microwavable cardboard packaging may also contain overhead ceramic patches which function in the same way. The technical term for such a microwave-absorbing patch is a susceptor.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{techniques}} by which heat may be delivered. Some {{of the most}} common involve the use of focused ultrasound (FUS or HIFU), <b>microwave</b> <b>heating,</b> induction heating, magnetic hyperthermia, and direct application of heat through the use of heated saline pumped through catheters. Experiments with carbon nanotubes that selectively bind to cancer cells have been performed. Lasers are then used that pass harmlessly through the body, but heat the nanotubes, causing the death of the cancer cells. Similar results have also been achieved with other types of nanoparticles, including gold-coated nanoshells and nanorods that exhibit certain degrees of 'tunability' of the absorption properties of the nanoparticles to the wavelength of light for irradiation. The success of this approach to cancer treatment rests on the existence of an 'optical window' in which biological tissue (i.e., healthy cells) are completely transparent at the wavelength of the laser light, while nanoparticles are highly absorbing at the same wavelength. Such a 'window' exists in the so-called near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. In this way, the laser light can pass through the system without harming healthy tissue, and only diseased cells, where the nanoparticles reside, get hot and are killed.|$|E

It contains more oil and low in vitamin B than raw rice bran. It's also rich in proteins, fiber, minerals. It is mainly used in feed formulation for livestock and poultry. High content of oil in parboiled rice bran is susceptible to rancidity caused by hydrolytic and oxidation activity during storage.

2500|$|A {{microwave}} oven heats food by passing microwave radiation through it. [...] Microwaves are {{a form of}} non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation with a frequency higher than ordinary radio waves but lower than infrared light. [...] Microwave ovens use frequencies {{in one of the}} ISM (industrial, scientific, medical) bands, which are reserved for this use, so they do not interfere with other vital radio services. [...] Consumer ovens usually use 2.45 gigahertz (GHz)—a wavelength of —while large industrial/commercial ovens often use 915 megahertz (MHz)—. Water, fat, and other substances in the food absorb energy from the microwaves in a process called dielectric heating. Many molecules (such as those of water) are electric dipoles, meaning that they have a partial positive charge at one end and a partial negative charge at the other, and therefore rotate as they try to align themselves with the alternating electric field of the microwaves. Rotating molecules hit other molecules and put them into motion, thus dispersing energy. This energy, when dispersed as molecular vibration in solids and liquids (i.e. as both potential energy and kinetic energy of atoms), is heat. Sometimes, <b>microwave</b> <b>heating</b> is explained as a resonance of water molecules, but this is incorrect; such resonances occur only at above 1 terahertz (THz). Rather it is the lag in response of the polar water molecule to the impinging electromagnetic wave. This type of dielectric loss mechanism is referred to as dipole interaction.|$|E
