25|$|Research has {{provided}} us with mixed results {{as to whether or}} not a person's involvement in social networking can affect their feelings of loneliness. Studies have indicated that how a person chooses to use social networking can change their feelings of loneliness in either a negative or positive way. Some companies with <b>mobile</b> <b>workers</b> have encouraged their workers to use social networking to feel connected, educators are using it to keep connected with their students and individuals are benefiting from social networking to keep connect with already close relationships that they've developed under circumstances that would otherwise make it difficult to do so. Each social networking user is able to create a community that centers around a personal identity they choose to create online. In his book Digital Identities: Creating and Communicating the Online Self, Rob Cover argues that social networking's foundation in Web 2.0, high-speed networking shifts online representation to one which is both visual and relational to other people, complexifying the identity process for younger people and creating new forms of anxiety. In 2016, news reports stated that excessive usage of SNS sites may be associated with an increase in the rates of depression, to almost triple the rate for non-SNS users. Experts worldwide have said that 2030 people who use SNS more have higher levels of depression than those who use SNS less.|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, the Almanacs were reconstituted as the Weavers, {{named after}} the title of an 1892 play by Gerhart Hauptmann about a workers' strike (which {{contained}} the lines, [...] "We'll stand it no more, come what may!"). They did benefits for strikers at which they sang songs such as 'Talking Union', about the struggles for unionisation of industrial workers such as miners and auto <b>mobile</b> <b>workers.</b> Besides Pete Seeger (performing under his own name), members of the Weavers included charter Almanac member Lee Hays, Ronnie Gilbert, and Fred Hellerman; later Frank Hamilton, Erik Darling, and Bernie Krause serially took Seeger's place. In {{the atmosphere of the}} 1950s red scare, the Weavers' repertoire had to be less overtly topical than that of the Almanacs had been, and its progressive message was couched in indirect language—arguably rendering it even more powerful. The Weavers on occasion performed in tuxedos (unlike the Almanacs, who had dressed informally) and their managers refused to let them perform at political venues. The Weavers' string of major hits began with [...] "On Top of Old Smoky" [...] and an arrangement of Lead Belly's signature waltz, [...] "Goodnight, Irene", which topped the charts for 13 weeks in 1950 and was covered by many other pop singers. On the flip side of [...] "Irene" [...] was the Israeli song [...] "Tzena, Tzena, Tzena". Other Weaver hits included [...] "Dusty Old Dust" [...] ("So Long It's Been Good to Know You" [...] by Woody Guthrie), [...] "Kisses Sweeter Than Wine" [...] (by Hays, Seeger, and Lead Belly), and the South African Zulu song by Solomon Linda, [...] "Wimoweh" [...] (about Shaka), among others.|$|E
2500|$|The early {{technological}} and industrial {{development in the}} United States was facilitated by a unique confluence of geographical, social, and economic factors. [...] The relative lack of workers kept United States wages nearly always higher than corresponding British and European workers and provided an incentive to mechanize some tasks. [...] The United States population had some semi-unique advantages in that they were former British subjects, had high English literacy skills, for that period (over 80% in New England), had strong British institutions, with some minor American modifications, of courts, laws, right to vote, protection of property rights {{and in many cases}} personal contacts among the British innovators of the Industrial Revolution. They had a good basic structure to build on. Another major advantage, which the British lacked, was no inherited aristocratic institutions. The eastern seaboard of the United States, with a great number of rivers and streams along the Atlantic seaboard, provided many potential sites for constructing textile mills necessary for early industrialization. The technology and information on how to build a textile industry was largely provided by Samuel Slater (1768–1835) who emigrated to New England in 1789. He had studied and worked in British textile mills {{for a number of years}} and immigrated to the United States, despite restrictions against it, to try his luck with U.S. manufacturers who were trying to set up a textile industry. He was offered a full partnership if he could succeed—he did. A vast supply of natural resources, the technological knowledge on how to build and power the necessary machines along with a labor supply of <b>mobile</b> <b>workers,</b> often unmarried females, all aided early industrialization. The broad knowledge of the Industrial Revolution and Scientific revolution helped facilitate understanding for the construction and invention of new manufacturing businesses and technologies. A limited government that would allow them to succeed or fail on their own merit helped.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: Wearable {{computing}} {{along with}} advanced mobile communication {{has the potential}} to revolutionise the working environment and working processes of the <b>mobile</b> <b>worker</b> of the AEC industry. While wearable computing allows the <b>mobile</b> <b>worker</b> to execute his/her work and tasks more efficiently and safer with the support of information provided by novel user interfaces, like augmented reality glasses and voice recognition, advanced mobile communication can transfer the information required in a certain context (location, time, task etc.) to and from the <b>mobile</b> <b>worker.</b> Wearable computing allows the <b>mobile</b> <b>worker</b> e. g. to access data bases like material lists and CAD drawings, to hold video conferences with remote or on-site experts without being distracted by additional hardware he has to handle, i. e. his hands and arms are free to concentrate completely on his work. For transferring data and voice calls numerous different networking technology and communication networks are available, like GPRS, UMTS and WLAN. However, communication costs, bandwidth and coverage limitations might prohibit its use on construction environments. Ad-hoc networking offers means of spontaneous communications between different devices without using an infrastructure and provides a promising communication solution for the AEC industry. This article focuses on the applicability of mobile ad-hoc networking in the AEC industry by providing a detailed scenario of how mobile ad-hoc networking can be used in the AEC industry, giving an overview of the existing mobile ad-hoc networks and addressing some issues of implementation and deployment of the networking protocol called Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector routing (AODV) ...|$|R

40|$|Many {{small rural}} {{communities}} have {{a flow of}} skilled people through the community, including employees from the government, non government and private sectors on fixed-term contracts, {{and a range of}} professionals, often attracted by amenity and seeking a sea change or tree change. The aim of the study reported in this paper was to investigate how rural communities can optimise benefits from professional and other highly skilled workers {{in the context of an}} increasingly mobile and transitory workforce. The paper examines the characteristics and attributes of <b>mobile</b> skilled <b>workers</b> from six different Australian rural communities and one Canadian rural community. It overviews the reasons why <b>mobile</b> skilled <b>workers</b> become involved in rural communities, the process of integration, and the reasons why they decide to stay or leave. If rural communities better understand the characteristics and motivations of <b>mobile</b> skilled <b>workers,</b> they will be able to better harness the potential of this group. Community settings and, to a lesser extent, policy, make a difference to <b>mobile</b> skilled <b>worker</b> integration and community participation. Community settings such as culture, interactional infrastructure and leadership influence the integration process for <b>mobile</b> skilled <b>workers.</b> Effectiveness of the integration process determines the nature and extent of <b>mobile</b> skilled <b>worker</b> contribution to the community and the likelihood that the worker will be retained in the community. Rural communities that make the most of the available pool of skills provided by <b>mobile</b> skilled <b>workers</b> can increase resilience, community capacity, identification and uptake of opportunities such as new enterprises, good practice in natural resource management, enhanced social and leisure opportunities, and the quality and range of local services...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{knowledge sharing}} and learning among <b>mobile</b> knowledge <b>workers.</b> The main focus is {{to study how}} <b>mobile</b> knowledge <b>workers</b> use knowledge sharing in their work and how these different knowledge-sharing situations could be supported by IT. This is further underlined by two research questions: How do <b>mobile</b> knowledge <b>workers</b> use knowledge sharing in their daily work? How can knowledge sharing among <b>mobile</b> knowledge <b>workers</b> be supported? The study was conducted at a large R&D company in Sweden, using qualitative, ethnographic observations of five <b>mobile</b> knowledge <b>workers.</b> The findings established that {{a large part of}} the workers days are concentrated around knowledge sharing in different situations, where the personal and work-related network is an important part. The extensive communication between people, both face-to-face and through different mediums, make it important to locate people and to know if they are available for communication. The extensive mobility among the people studied makes these issues uncertain, since the <b>mobile</b> knowledge <b>workers</b> constantly move between the home office and other parts in the building, or travel to other locations in the world. The findings are divided into four different situations of knowledge sharing: Knowing your nodes, Knowledge sharing about meetings, Locating for unscheduled meetings and Communication of availability. Design implications concerning these different situations are presented, where indications about how knowledge sharing and learning in these situations could be supported with IT. These implications contain both guidelines and more concrete examples of possible IT support for specific situations...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: The AEC & FM-sector 1 {{is aware}} of the {{potentials}} arising from the usage of mobile technology in construction for streamlining their business processes. Discussions are no longer on whether or not to use mobile computer-supported solutions but, rather, on how they should be implanted and used. The following publication describes an integrated, holistic framework for context-sensitive, mobile applications based on the concept of Virtual Organisations, the pattern-based software development paradigm, and multi-dimensional data management developed at the Dresden University of Technology. By applying this approach in early field tests mobile technology became an integrated, complementing part of information systems and newly developed, flexible, adaptable business scenarios instead of remaining just another fashionable toy used as an “add-on” reflecting already existing business practices. The innovations presented in this paper rely on the Concept of the <b>Mobile</b> <b>Worker</b> (CoMoWo) as well as of Mobile, Ambient Intelligent, Networked Environment (MAIN-E). CoMoWo combines pattern definitions and a hierarchically structured layer concept to describe the relationships and interdependencies among the individual patterns. CoMoWo will {{contribute to the development of}} innovative methods and adaptive project management models. MAIN-E consists of a set of technology components supporting CoMoWo, such as a multi-dimensional information framework, intelligent agents, and location-based services. This will lead to a supportive IT-infrastructure mobile and fixed to provide information on demand and in the right context to the <b>mobile</b> <b>worker...</b>|$|R
