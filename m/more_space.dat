This gave rise to Jewish attempts at gaining ownership of the land adjacent to the Wall.|$|E
5|$|At Chelsea, Fàbregas {{played a}} similar playmaking role in midfield, using his technique, ball control, vision, and passing ability to dictate the tempo of his team's play, {{while he was}} {{supported}} by defensive midfielders, {{in order to give}} him <b>more</b> <b>space</b> and time on the ball. In this deeper creative role, he excelled in Chelsea's new style of play under Mourinho, where he proved to be an effective assist-provider.|$|E

Iridions executive producer was Dan Kitchen, a former programmer for Atari. Iridion 3D was Shin'en's first product to utilize the GAX Sound Engine, which allowed real-time decoding of song data in an extremely small file size; this allowed <b>more</b> <b>space</b> on the cartridge {{to be used for}} graphics.|$|E
5|$|The Riverview {{became one}} of the few {{remaining}} single-screen theaters in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area; by the end of the 1980s, it was one of only six left, and after 1998, it was one of only four left, with the Uptown and Parkway Theaters and the Oak Street Cinema, although since 1998, several new single-screen theaters–the Trylon Microcinema and the Heights Theater–have opened. The owners installed new seats in 1999 that allowed for greater leg room and <b>more</b> <b>space</b> between patrons.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was substantially altered in 1835 by architect Sydney Smirke. In {{order to provide}} <b>more</b> <b>space,</b> he added blocks {{at either end of}} the frontage, and galleried wings on either side of the central portion. He also added a small single-storey lodge, still in existence, at the Lambeth Road gate. Later, between 1844–46, the central cupola was replaced with a copper-clad dome in order to expand the chapel beneath. The building also featured a theatre in a building to the rear of the site.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{industrialization}} {{of modern}} societies in todays’ world {{has had an}} enormous effect on reducing the traditional ways of communication among people. The cities {{of the world are}} in serious demand of <b>more</b> specific <b>spaces</b> that fulfils the Socio–cultural relationships of the people. As a result, creating <b>more</b> <b>spaces</b> for the people who frequently try to overcome the dearth of human communication and interaction is necessary. This study has specifically focused on Iranian traditional urban places and spaces which used to effectively address the issue mentioned above. Among them, teashops, Charsooghs, lines, squares, shrines and traditional markets (bazaar) were regarded as the main vibrant places and spaces. The findings reassure the importance of designer role to establish <b>more</b> <b>spaces</b> for <b>more</b> social interactions...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the size}} of noble {{households}} shrank slightly during the 16th century, the number of guests at the largest castle events continued to grow. 2,000 came to a feast at Cawood Castle in 1466, while the Duke of Buckingham routinely entertained up to 519 people at Thornbury Castle {{at the start of}} the 16th century. When Elizabeth I visited Kenilworth in 1575 she brought an entourage of 31 barons and 400 staff for a visit that lasted an exceptional 19 days; Leicester, the castle's owner, entertained the Queen and much of the neighbouring region with pageants, fireworks, bear baiting, mystery plays, hunting and lavish banquets. With this scale of living and entertainment the need to find <b>more</b> <b>space</b> in older castles became a major issue in both England and Scotland.|$|E

5|$|An Introduction was {{reviewed}} positively in several academic publications. The political philosopher Steve Cooke said that Cochrane's own approach showed promise, {{and that the}} book would have benefited from devoting <b>more</b> <b>space</b> to it. Robert Garner, a political theorist, praised Cochrane's synthesis of such {{a broad range of}} literature, but argued that the work was too uncritical of the concept of justice as it might apply to animals. Cochrane's account of interest-based rights for animals was subsequently considered at greater length in his 2012 book Animal Rights Without Liberation, published by Columbia University Press. An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory {{was one of the first}} books to explore animals from the perspective of political theory, and became an established part of a literature critical of the topic's traditional neglect.|$|E
5|$|Butthole Surfers {{began to}} take the {{collection}} of visual equipment seriously following Coffey's recruitment in 1983, when he added a clear plastic drum fitted with a strobe light to their show. Shortly afterwards, the band purchased what was reported as several thousand dollars worth of stolen strobe lights at a bargain rate, and their visual equipment soon took up <b>more</b> <b>space</b> than their instruments. Smoke machines were later added. Equally memorable was the band's propensity for projecting a variety of films behind them as they played, beginning with one 16-millimeter projector, before adding others. This set-up allowed them to play a number of overlapping movies {{at the same time}} which were often strangely angled, upside down or played in reverse. Combined with the increasing number of strobe lights, the effect created a visually disorienting atmosphere, which occasionally caused epileptic seizures in audience members.|$|E
5|$|By the mid 1890s, {{the station}} was {{frequently}} overcrowded and North Philadelphia and the northern suburbs grew in population. The completion of the Delair Bridge in 1896 allowed passengers to ride trains directly to the summer resorts of southern New Jersey (rather than taking a ferry to Camden) further increased traffic on the line. George B. Roberts, president of the railroad, used his social connections to hire Theophilus Parsons Chandler, Jr. to construct a new station. The new station was constructed on a former freight yard {{on the south side}} of the tracks (across from the previous station), where there was <b>more</b> <b>space</b> for the station. The site also provided better connections for passengers using newly electrified streetcars on Glenwood Avenue and North Broad Street to reach the station.|$|E

5|$|Clifford's Tower {{played no}} part in the formal design of the prison, {{although}} the talus, or sloping edge of the motte, was cut away and replaced by a retaining wall to allow <b>more</b> <b>space</b> for the new prison building. The backyard of the Female Prison, concealed from public view by the new wall, was used for hangings from 1868 onwards. The Prison Act, 1877, reformed the English prison system, and York Castle gaol was passed into the control of central government the following year. It {{was used as the}} county prison until 1900, when the remaining prisoners were transferred to Wakefield Prison, and from then onwards the facility was used as a military prison instead.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary annals {{began to}} be kept in Wessex during the 7th century. The {{material}} compiled in Alfred's reign included annals relating to Kentish, South Saxon, Mercian and, particularly, West Saxon history, but, {{with the exception of the}} Cynewulf entry, does not gather momentum until it comes to the Nordic invasions of the late 8th century onwards. The Chronicle grew out of the tradition of the Easter Tables, drawn up to help the clergy determine the dates of feasts in future years: a page consisted of a sequence of horizontal lines followed by astronomical data, with a space for short notes of events to distinguish one year from another. As the Chronicle developed, it lost its list-like appearance, and such notes took up <b>more</b> <b>space,</b> becoming more like historical records. Many later entries, especially those written by contemporaries, contained a great deal of historical narrative under the year headings.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the criticism, tournament organisers ERC agreed to review the penalty {{shoot-out}} system, although they confirmed that they had already considered and dismissed some other possible ways of deciding matches, including replaying the game, having a 'next try wins' rule in extra time, {{reducing the number of}} players on the pitch periodically in extra time to create <b>more</b> <b>space</b> and deciding the game on a coin toss. The format for the penalty shoot-out was changed prior to the following season's tournament, removing the requirement for all players on the field (including forwards) to participate, however for the remainder of its existence, the Heineken Cup retained the penalty shoot-out as the final system for deciding a winner if required. No other Heineken Cup match needed to use it.|$|E

5|$|In the Browns' biggest {{trade of}} the offseason, Brown sent end John Harrington to the Chicago Rockets for Bill Boedeker, a halfback. Perhaps the most {{significant}} signing, however, was punter Horace Gillom, who had played for Brown at Massillon Washington High School and who Brown had recruited to Ohio State before World War II. Gillom could kick the ball further than most punters of his era. He changed the way teams approached punting by lining up 15 yards behind the center instead of the customary 10 yards to give himself <b>more</b> <b>space</b> and time to make his kicks. Gillom was also the third black player to sign with the Browns {{at a time when}} many teams did not employ African-Americans. Cleveland chose fullback Dick Hoerner in the AAFC draft, but he signed instead with the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League.|$|E
5|$|Intimidation is an {{important}} element of a hockey game and some enforcers start fights just to intimidate opposing players in hopes that they will refrain from agitating skilled players. For example, in the late 1950s, Gordie Howe helped establish himself as an enforcer by defeating Lou Fontinato, a notable tough guy who tallied over 1,200 penalty minutes in his career. Fontinato suffered a broken nose from the fight. After that incident, Howe got a lot <b>more</b> <b>space</b> on the ice and was able to score many goals over the span of his career because he intimidated other players. Conversely, games in European professional leagues are known to be less violent than North American games because fighting is discouraged in Europe by ejection and heavy fines. Since the penalties for fighting are so severe, the enforcers are less able to intimidate opposing players with fighting and said players take more liberties on the ice.|$|E

Refurbished and new trains sport sleeker designs, improved passenger information systems, more grab poles, wider seats, <b>more</b> <b>space</b> near the doors, spaces for wheelchairs and CCTV cameras. As a trial run, luggage racks were installed on the C751B trains to serve travellers on the Changi Airport branch line. The scheme was withdrawn in June 2002 and the luggage racks removed.|$|E
