As a result, in 1823, some deputies proposed suspending the confiscation decree and the delivering ownership of the properties in question to their tenants. One of these deputies declared that [...] "the farms have been taken over by rich capitalists, and these, once they have taken possession of them, have made a new lease, generally increasing the rent to the poor farmer, threatening to spoil if they do not pay on time". But despite the criticism, the confiscation process continued unchanged.|$|E

Book values of debt may be a more downward biased proxy of the <b>market</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> for diversified firms, relative to undiversified firms, as diversification leads to lower firm risk. Thus, measures of firm value based on book values of debt undervalue diversified firms relative to focused firms. Our paper complements recent literature which uses market values to test the risk reduction hypothesis for a subsample of firms for which debt is traded. Alternatively, we employ <b>market</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> estimates for the whole firm universe. Consistent with the above hypothesis, we show that the use of book values of debt underestimates the value of diversified firms.

40|$|In their {{theoretical}} work, Ferguson and Shockley (2002) show that, in a Black and Scholes (1973) –Merton (1974) type of economy, the single–beta CAPM {{is likely}} to misprice equities with high default risk, if the empiricist omits the <b>market</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> from the market portfolio. This holds, as under certain assumptions on the economy’s parameters the sensitivity of equity to aggregate debt (the debt beta) and thus the sensitivity of equity to the true market portfolio (the market beta) increases in financial distress. We perform a calibration exercise to test this hypothesis. Specifically, we use real data on {{the market value of}} equity, the book value of debt and the riskfree rate of return to imply the <b>market</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> which would prevail in the above economy. We show that: (1) Debt betas increase in default risk.

(3) Even if debt betas related as strongly to the anomalies as to default risk, this would not save the CAPM.

30|$|So far, firm {{valuation}} models {{capture the}} firm’s chosen refinancing/adjustment policy by offering two simple types of “debt policies” or “financing policies”. 3 The first policy assumes future debt levels {{to be certain}} (non-stochastic) [(see, Modigliani and Miller 1958) and 1963 henceforth termed MM)], whereas the second policy rests on certain leverage ratios based on <b>market</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> and equity (see, e.g., Miles and Ezzell 1980 and 1985; Harris and Pringle 1985) henceforth termed ME).

In a perfect world without taxes, the cost of capital formula for a finite stream of free cash flows, with debt and equity financing, is elegant, simple and eminently sensible. The cost of capital is a weighted average of the cost <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> and the cost of equity, where the weights are the <b>market</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> and equity as percentages <b>of</b> the levered <b>market</b> <b>value.</b> In a perfect world with taxes, complications abound.

Fundamentally, the cost of capital is a question about how to properly account for the tax benefits (if any) from the interest deduction with debt financing. In other words, what are the appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates for the tax shield? At last count, there were 23 theories!

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to test assertions that {{economic}} value added (EVA) is more highly associated with stock returns and firm values than accrual earnings, and evaluates which components of EVA, contribute to these associations. Design/methodology/approach – Thirty three non-EVA users and 75 EVA users were selected at random. Variables used in this study were revenues, profits, assets, stockholders’ equity, <b>market</b> <b>value,</b> earnings per share, total return to investors, and percentage cost reduction over time. Data were collected on several metrics. Findings – The study suggest that the common and widely accepted metrics used by analysts and calculated for EVA users are not necessarily superior to that of non-EVA users. The evidence support that EVA is somewhat invalid, unreliable, and questionable. Research limitations/implications – The first limitation deals with the measurement of capital invested in assets. The second limitation was the use of an accounting definition of the return on equity. The operating income was not cleansed of any expenses which are really capital expenses (in the sense that they create future value). The operating income was adjusted if any cosmetic effects were identified. The third limitation is the determination of cost of capital (estimate). Discounted cash flow valuation assumes that cost of capital is calculated using <b>market</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> and equity. Practical implications – This study raises serious doubts about the capacity of EVA to deliver superior metrics. EVA users may be placing themselves at unnecessary risks and costs. Study shows that EVA is not a satisfactory descriptor of the real world and, therefore, it should be used with caution by management consultants, practitioners, and investors.
