40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a {{new type}} of {{vibration}} structure (i. e. swing frame) of vertical dynamic <b>balancing</b> <b>machine</b> is designed, which is based on the analysis of traditional double-plane vertical dynamic <b>balancing</b> <b>machine’s</b> swing frame. The static unbalance and couple unbalance can be separated effectively by using the new dynamic <b>balancing</b> <b>machine</b> with the new swing frame. The modal and harmonic responses are analyzed by using the ANSYS 7. 0. By comparing the finite element modal analysis with the experimental modal analysis, the natural frequencies and vibration modes are found out, which can provide the dynamics direction for designing vertical dynamic <b>balancing</b> <b>machine.</b> The new dynamic <b>balancing</b> <b>machine</b> can measure static unbalance and couple unbalance directly, and the influence between them is faint. The practical result indicates that the new vertical dynamic <b>balancing</b> <b>machine</b> is suitable for inertial measurement of flying objects, and can overcome the shortcomings of traditional double-plane vertical dynamic <b>balancing</b> <b>machines,</b> in which the effect of plane-separation is inferior. The vertical dynamic <b>balancing</b> <b>machine</b> with the new vibration structure can be widely used in the future application...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an energy-based {{algorithm}} to mini-mize limit cycles in dynamically balancing wheeled inverted pen-dulum (IP) machines. Because the algorithm {{is not based}} on ab-solute values of parameters, the performance is robust and ac-counts for mechanical reconfiguration and wear. The effects of phenomena such as drive-train friction, rolling friction, backlash and sensor bandwidth are well known, causing either limit cycles or instabilities in IP <b>balancing</b> <b>machines</b> and yet compensation or control design to mitigate these effects are not well known.

This Balancer is used for balancing reentry vehicles. In addition, the study identified potential causes of possible spindle-shaft seizure leading to a rapid deceleration of the rotating assembly. These accident sequences extend to the point that the reentry vehicle either remains in stable condition on the <b>balancing</b> <b>machine</b> or leaves the machine with some translational and rotational motion. Fault-tree analysis was used to identify possible causes of spindle-shaft seizure, and failure modes and effects analysis identified the results of shearing of different machine components. Cause-consequence diagrams were used to help develop accident sequences resulting from the possible effects of spindle-shaft seizure. To make these accident sequences physically reasonable, the analysts used idealized models of the dynamics of rotating masses. Idealized physical modeling also was used to provide approximate values of accident parameters that lead to branching down different accident progression paths.

40|$|A {{new type}} of <b>balancing</b> <b>machine</b> is {{proposed}} which uses a dynamic vibration absorber as a device measuring unbalance. When an unbalanced rotor rotates, centrifugal forces are generated which result in sinusoidal forces being transmitted to the supporting structure. An undamped dynamic vibration absorber {{is attached to the}} structure in the proposed machine. When it is tuned to resonate at the test rotational speed, the structure does not move at all; the auxiliary system vibrates {{in such a way that}} the phase angle between the displacement of auxiliary mass and the sinusoidal force is exactly 180 degrees and that the product of the auxiliary mass and the amplitude of its vibration is equal to the amount of unbalance. Therefore, the motion of the auxiliary mass provides sufficient information for balancing the rotor.

For the satellite-borne rotors’ low working revs and large centroidal deviation and height, and that the horizontal vibration produced by {{centrifugal force}} is not of the same magnitude as the torsional vibration by overturning moment, the <b>balancing</b> <b>machine’s</b> measurement accuracy is low. Analysis shows that the mixture of horizontal vibration and torsional vibration of the vibrational mechanism contribute mainly to the machine’s performance, as well as the instability of vibration center position. A vibrational mechanism was put forward, in which the horizontal and torsional vibration get separated effectively by way of fixing the vibration center. From experimental results, the separation between the weak centrifugal force signal and the strong moment signal was realized, errors caused by unstable vibration center are avoided, and the <b>balancing</b> <b>machine</b> based on this vibration structure is able to meet the requirements of dynamic balancing for the satellite’s rotating payloads in terms of accuracy and stability...|$|R

40|$|International audienceControlling the part's {{balance of}} {{crankshafts}} {{is an important}} issue for automobile manufacturers. Unbalance measurement is carried out, in general, with high-precision mechanical <b>balancing</b> <b>machines.</b> Each model of crankshaft requires a specialized mechanical <b>balancing</b> <b>machine.</b> We propose a new solution for balancing crankshafts by replacing mechanical measuring systems with a non-contact digitizing system, which allows the acquisition of a representative 3 D point cloud of the crankshaft surface. The Voxel 2 inertia method is proposed to convert 3 D scanned point clouds into a voxel-based representation and to calculate the inertia matrix and the unbalance vectors. Theoretical CAD models are used to determinate the best setting for mesh and voxelization. Several levels of error are introduced on CAD models in order to estimate the necessary scanning quality, and thus define the appropriate scanning system for balancing measurements. The Voxel 2 inertia algorithm is validated on three different crankshaft models that were scanned with the most appropriate digitizing system. The results highlight that this new approach for determining unbalance vectors from scanned data is suitable for replacing the current mechanical measuring systems. This technology can make the production lines more flexible and more adaptable for future changes...|$|R
50|$|In soft ground, {{there are}} three main types of TBMs: Earth Pressure <b>Balance</b> <b>Machines</b> (EPB), Slurry Shield (SS) and {{open-face}} type. Both types of closed machines operate like Single Shield TBMs, using thrust cylinders to advance forward by pushing off against concrete segments. Earth Pressure <b>Balance</b> <b>Machines</b> are used in soft ground with less than 7 bar of pressure. The cutter head does not use disc cutters only, but instead an combination of tungsten carbide cutting bits, carbide disc cutters, drag picks and/or hard rock disc cutters. The EPB gets its name because it uses the excavated material to balance the pressure at the tunnel face. Pressure is maintained in the cutterhead by controlling the rate of extraction of spoil through the Archimedes screw and the advance rate. Additives such as bentonite, polymers and foam can be injected ahead of the face to increase {{the stability of the}} ground. Additives can also be injected in the cutterhead/extraction screw to ensure that the spoil remains sufficiently cohesive to form a plug in the Archimedes screw to maintain pressure in the cutterhead and restrict water flowing through.|$|R
