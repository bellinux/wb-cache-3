500|$|On December 3, 2009, Rollins {{wrote of}} {{his support for}} the victims of the Bhopal {{disaster}} in India, in an article for Vanity Fair 25 years–to the day–after the methyl isocyanate gas leak from the Union Carbide Corporation's pesticide factory exposed {{more than half a million}} local people to poisonous gas and resulted in the death of 17,000. He spent time in Bhopal with the people, to listen to their stories. In a later radio interview in February 2010 Rollins summed up his approach to activism, [...] "This is where <b>my</b> <b>anger</b> takes me, to places like this, not into abuse but into proactive, clean movement." ...|$|E
500|$|Like Ice-T's {{gangsta rap}} albums, Body Counts {{material}} focused on various {{social and political}} issues, with songs focusing on topics ranging from police brutality to drug abuse. According to Ernie C, [...] "Everybody writes about whatever they learned growing up, and we were no exception. Like The Beach Boys sing about the beach, we sing {{about the way we}} grew up." [...] Ice-T states that [...] "Body Count was an angry record. It {{was meant to be a}} protest record. I put <b>my</b> <b>anger</b> in it, while lacing it with dark humor." [...] The spoken introduction, [...] "Smoked Pork" [...] features Ice-T taking on the roles of a gangster pretending to be seemingly stranded motorist and a police officer who refuses to aid. The track begins with Mooseman and Ice-T driving their car towards a police car, and then Ice-T asks for the gun Mooseman has and tells Mooseman to stay in the car, much to Mooseman's chagrin, as Mooseman wanted to kill the cop in this round. Ice-T then walks up to the policeman, pretending to be a stranded motorist, asking for help, but the policeman refuses, saying: [...] "Nah, that's not my job! My job's not to help your fuckin' ass out!", then telling him that [...] "my job is eatin' these doughnuts". When the officer recognizes Ice-T, gunshots are heard. The final voice on the track is Ice-T confirming his identity.|$|E

5000|$|Yonge's {{devotion to}} her father was lifelong and her {{relationship}} with him {{seems to have been}} for her the standard for all other relationships, including marriage. His [...] "approbation was throughout life <b>my</b> bliss; his <b>anger</b> <b>my</b> misery for the time." ...|$|R

2500|$|Steele {{stated in}} a 2003 {{interview}} that he was bipolar, and linked his mood swings to the types of songs he wrote. He also suffered from clinical depression {{for which he had}} received occasional psychiatric treatment. During a 2007 interview Steele explained:"I've always been a very depressed person, but that's only one side of me, you know. It makes me feel better when I can express my depression, <b>my</b> <b>anger,</b> my frustration through music... sonic therapy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{continuation}} of the reading, God told Moses what the people had done, saying [...] "let Me be, that <b>My</b> <b>anger</b> may blaze forth against them and that I may destroy them, and make of you a great nation." [...] But Moses implored God not to do so, lest the Egyptians say that God delivered the people only to kill them off in the mountains. Moses called on God to remember Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and God's oath to make their offspring as numerous as the stars, and God renounced the planned punishment. The fifth open portion ( [...] , petuchah) ends here.|$|E

60|$|Zara. The long, sleepless {{night at}} length hath passed. The paper is destroyed, and now nought remains but to confess the deed, and brave <b>my</b> father's <b>anger.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "And then I was afraid, as {{remembering that}} cruel thing I said once in <b>my</b> sinful <b>anger.</b> Oh, {{appointed}} of God to be a soldier, {{and the greatest}} in the land! and in <b>my</b> ignorant <b>anger</b> I said I would drown you with my own hands if you unsexed yourself and brought shame to your name and family. Ah, how could I ever have said it, and you so good and dear and innocent! I was afraid; for I was guilty. You understand it now, my child, and you forgive?" ...|$|R
2500|$|The Zohar {{compared}} Moses to Noah {{and found}} Moses superior. [...] For when God told Moses in [...] “Now therefore let me alone, that <b>My</b> <b>anger</b> may grow hot against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make of {{you a great}} nation,” Moses immediately asked whether he could possibly abandon Israel for his own advantage. [...] Moses protested {{that the world would}} say that he had killed Israel and did to them as Noah did to his generation. [...] For when God bade Noah to save himself and his household from the Flood, Noah did not intercede on behalf of his generation, but let them perish. [...] It {{is for this reason that}} Scripture names the waters of the Flood after Noah, as [...] says, “For this is as the waters of Noah to me.” Thus, Moses sought mercy for his people, and God indeed showed them mercy.|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>anger</b> came later. For the moment, {{the sudden}} light blinded me to {{everything}} but fear.|$|E
60|$|During {{this speech}} <b>my</b> <b>anger</b> had been {{steadily}} rising.. But it was Mrs. Cooke who interrupted him.|$|E
60|$|And as I read, slowly <b>my</b> long-cherished <b>anger</b> evaporated, and {{the real}} Mary, outspoken and simple, whom I had {{obscured}} by a cloud of fancied infidelities, returned to me....|$|R
60|$|Truth to say, I was abashed by {{the silence}} which {{was her only}} answer to this sally. I said to myself that I would not let <b>my</b> natural <b>anger,</b> <b>my</b> just fury be {{disarmed}} by any assumption of pathos or dignity. I suppose I was really {{out of my mind}} and what in the middle ages would have been called “possessed” by an evil spirit. I went on enjoying my own villainy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Faithless--perjured--" [...] cried I, striding {{across the}} room. But another glance at that {{beautiful}} being in distress, checked all <b>my</b> wrath. <b>Anger</b> could not dwell {{together with her}} idea in my soul.|$|R

60|$|I raged and stormed {{before the}} officer who brought me this infamous piece of news. I gave vent to <b>my</b> {{impotent}} <b>anger</b> in blasphemous expressions that were afterwards to be used against me. The officer was subtly sympathetic.|$|R
6000|$|Don Ferd. What! do you laugh? you vile, mischievous varlet!-- [Collars him.] But that you're beneath <b>my</b> <b>anger,</b> I'd tear {{your heart}} out! [Throws him from him.] ...|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>anger</b> subdued by Mr. Washington's presence, {{a curious}} mood had taken its place. A foolish mood, I thought it, {{but one of}} feeling things to come.|$|E

6000|$|... "So be it, Harmachis! And I, Harmachis--I fly also, {{but with}} swifter wings. My game is played. I, too, have made atonement. Oh! what a bitter fate is mine, to have brought misery on all I love, and, in the end, to die unloved! To thee I have atoned; to <b>my</b> <b>angered</b> Gods I have atoned; and now I go {{to find a}} way whereby I may atone to Cleopatra in that Hell where she is, and which I must share! For she loved me well, Harmachis; and, now that she is dead, methinks that, after thee, I loved her best of all. So of her cup and the cup of Iras I will surely drink!" [...] And she took the phial, and with a steady hand poured {{what was left of the}} poison into the goblet.|$|R

60|$|<b>My</b> <b>anger</b> {{died away}} despite myself. The man's {{strength}} and honesty of purpose were things which I {{could not bring}} myself to doubt. I continued my breakfast in silence.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{happened}} to me?" [...] he asked wildly, and as my fears {{that he had}} been killed were banished by the words, so did <b>my</b> <b>anger</b> against him return.|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you answer}} me?" [...] I roared, and under <b>my</b> display of <b>anger</b> he looked truculent, and thus {{exhausted}} the last remnant of my patience.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is so, <b>my</b> son. God's <b>anger</b> still burns fiercely, and {{the people}} perish; yet {{it may be that}} He will be merciful, in the end." ...|$|R
