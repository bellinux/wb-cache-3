5|$|F-84C: Reverted to the <b>more</b> <b>reliable</b> J35-A-13 engine, {{improved}} fuel, hydraulic {{and electrical}} systems; 191 built.|$|E
5|$|The {{inability}} to compress the vein {{is one of}} the <b>more</b> <b>reliable</b> indications of venous thrombosis.|$|E
5|$|Turbines {{offered more}} power than {{reciprocating}} engines for the same volume of machinery. This, along with a guarantee on the new machinery from the inventor, Charles Parsons, persuaded the Royal Navy to use turbines in Dreadnought. It is often said that turbines had the additional benefits of being cleaner and <b>more</b> <b>reliable</b> than reciprocating engines. By 1905, new designs of reciprocating engine were available which were cleaner and <b>more</b> <b>reliable</b> than previous models.|$|E
50|$|The {{carabiner}} {{has been}} improved {{several times over}} the decades, making it <b>more</b> lightweight, <b>reliable</b> and durable.|$|R

5|$|In 2001, Lieutenant Colonel Odin Lieberman, {{commander}} of the V-22 squadron at Marine Corps Air Station New River, was relieved of duty after allegations that he instructed his unit to falsify maintenance records to make the aircraft appear <b>more</b> <b>reliable.</b> A total of three USMC officers were later implicated as having {{played a role in}} the falsification scandal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, organ {{builders}} began to incorporate digital components into their key, stop, and combination actions. Besides making these mechanisms simpler and <b>more</b> <b>reliable,</b> this {{also makes it}} possible to record and play back an organist's performance via the MIDI protocol. In addition, some organ builders have incorporated digital stops into their pipe organs.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the moons}} of Saturn, {{including}} Pandora and Prometheus, act as shepherd moons to confine the rings and {{prevent them from}} spreading out. Pan and Atlas cause weak, linear density waves in Saturn's rings that have yielded <b>more</b> <b>reliable</b> calculations of their masses.|$|E
5000|$|In the manga, while Haruto {{still thinks}} he doesn't really {{fit in the}} Council in his own words, he's noticeably <b>more</b> mature, <b>reliable</b> and level-headed than his anime incarnation, and gets along {{somewhat}} better with the spirits.|$|R
2500|$|Electric {{locomotives}} {{are also}} usually quieter, more powerful, and <b>more</b> responsive and <b>reliable</b> than diesels.|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecent {{electricity}} cuts {{in several}} countries have highlighted the need for <b>more</b> efficient, <b>reliable</b> switching, {{at a time when}} defence-funded development of larger-area, higher-quality silicon carbide wafers may yield less costly high-power, high-frequency and high-temperature electronic components for civil applications...|$|R
5|$|The F-84C {{featured}} a somewhat <b>more</b> <b>reliable</b> J35-A-13 engine {{and had some}} engineering refinements. Being virtually identical to the F-84B, the C model suffered {{from all of the}} same defects and underwent a similar structural upgrade program in 1949. All F-84Cs were withdrawn from active service by 1952.|$|E
5|$|The diamond can {{be split}} by a single, well {{calculated}} blow of a hammer to a pointed tool, which is quick, but risky. Alternatively, {{it can be}} cut with a diamond saw, which is a <b>more</b> <b>reliable</b> but tedious procedure.|$|E
5|$|The least active {{season on}} record since 1946 (when the {{database}} is considered <b>more</b> <b>reliable)</b> was the 1983 Atlantic hurricane season, with one tropical storm, two hurricanes, and one major hurricane. Overall, the 1914 Atlantic hurricane season remains the least active, {{with only one}} documented storm.|$|E
50|$|In addition; Northern has {{announced}} plans to replace the station's HelpPoint intercom system with a <b>more</b> updated <b>reliable</b> model. This will enable passengers to speak to a member of staff in Northern's control centre for information or to summon assistance in emergency situations.|$|R
50|$|A {{red panda}} who usually {{looks up to}} Panda despite being far <b>more</b> capable and <b>reliable</b> than him.|$|R
50|$|Rescue 21 is {{designed}} to be <b>more</b> robust, <b>reliable,</b> and capable than the legacy system by using a modern radio system coupled with a TCP/IP network, and digital communication using VoIP. It was created to better locate mariners in distress and save lives and property at sea and on navigable rivers.|$|R
5|$|The newer M5000 trams {{proved to}} be {{considerably}} <b>more</b> <b>reliable</b> than the T-68/A fleet; which averaged 5,000 miles between breakdowns, while the M5000's averaged 20,000 miles. This led to a decision in 2012 to withdraw the entire fleet from service {{and replace them with}} M5000's. All of the T-68 and T-68As were withdrawn between April 2012 and April 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} {{prospective}} cohort {{studies on the}} relationship between abortion and breast cancer have been consistently negative. Such studies are considered <b>more</b> <b>reliable</b> than retrospective studies and case-control studies. The positive association between abortion and breast cancer risk observed in case-control studies is accounted for by recall bias.|$|E
5|$|To resolve traffic {{congestion}} {{and to provide}} a <b>more</b> <b>reliable</b> means of crossing the Victoria Harbour, a rapid transit railway system (metro), the MTR, was planned from the 1970s onwards. The Island Line (Hong Kong Island), Kwun Tong Line (Kowloon Peninsula and East Kowloon) and Tsuen Wan Line (Kowloon and urban New Territories) opened in the early 1980s.|$|E
30|$|The {{outcomes}} {{will help}} to guide future early recognition and intervention by providing a <b>more</b> detailed and <b>reliable</b> approach to psychiatric risk stratification.|$|R
5000|$|We {{agree with}} their {{decision}} reverse the ban, {{but they have}} the wrong reasoning the reversal: they had no business censoring that article {{in the first place}} — the community of Wikipedia editors is if anything the <b>more</b> legitimate, <b>reliable</b> and grown-up adjudicator of which images are appropriate subject matter for an encyclopaedia.|$|R
50|$|Devices using {{semiconductors}} were {{at first}} constructed based on empirical knowledge, before semiconductor theory provided {{a guide to}} construction of <b>more</b> capable and <b>reliable</b> devices.|$|R
5|$|Although in {{operational}} theatres {{such as the}} Gulf War the Jaguar {{proved to}} be mechanically <b>more</b> <b>reliable</b> than the Panavia Tornado, the aircraft's avionics were a hindrance to conducting missions. Owing to the Jaguar A's shortcomings in navigation and target acquisition, French Jaguars had to be escorted by Dassault Mirage F1CR reconnaissance aircraft to act as guides. The Jaguar provided a valuable component of the campaign, the RAF detachment of 12 Jaguars flew 612 combat sorties, with no aircraft lost.|$|E
5|$|Although the Skyraider {{was a third}} {{smaller and}} carried a third less bombload, it proved <b>more</b> <b>reliable</b> in service and easier to fly and land, and Navy pilots {{preferred}} it. In 1950 {{the decision was made}} to use the Mauler only from shore-based units and later that year all but Naval Reserve units abandoned the type. The aircraft operated with reserve squadrons until 1953.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{and modern}} historians {{provided}} different estimations {{for the number}} of ships and troops under the command of Basiliscus, {{as well as for the}} expenses of the expedition. Both were enormous; Nicephorus Gregoras speaks of one hundred thousand ships, the <b>more</b> <b>reliable</b> Cedrenus says that the fleet that attacked Carthage consisted of eleven hundred and thirteen ships, having each one hundred men on board. The most conservative estimation for expedition expenses is of 64,000pounds of gold, a sum that exceeded a whole year's revenue.|$|E
30|$|The {{results from}} the {{proposed}} method for failure detection are <b>more</b> objective and <b>reliable</b> because the criteria weights were determined using an objective weight approach.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop and {{validate}} a simple, rapid, precise, <b>more</b> accurate, <b>reliable,</b> least time consuming HPLC method for individual as well as simultaneous estimation of pravastatin, atorvastatin and simvastatin in bulk and pharmaceutical dosage form.

30|$|Preliminary {{tests on}} PBAS {{indicated}} apparent {{success in the}} performance of the system. However, performance can be further enhanced to produce <b>more</b> accurate and <b>reliable</b> results.|$|R
5|$|Bradbury {{took charge}} at Los Alamos at a {{difficult}} time. Staff were leaving in droves, living conditions were poor {{and there was}} a possibility that the laboratory would close. He managed to persuade enough staff to stay, and got the University of California to renew the contract to manage the laboratory. He pushed continued development of nuclear weapons, transforming them from laboratory devices to production models. Numerous improvements made them safer, <b>more</b> <b>reliable</b> and easier to store and handle, and made more efficient use of scarce fissionable materiel.|$|E
5|$|Buckingham and Wotton were <b>more</b> <b>reliable</b> {{than the}} Aveling and Porter engines. With modern {{locomotives}} on the Brill–Quainton Road route (the Kingswood branch generally remained worked by horses, and occasionally by the Aveling and Porter engines), traffic rose. The figure for milk traffic rose from 40,000gallons carried in 1875 to 58,000gallons (260,000l; 70,000USgal) in 1879, and in 1877 the Tramway carried 20,994tons (21,331t) of goods. In early 1877 it appeared on Bradshaw maps and from May 1882 Bradshaw listed the timetable.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{theory is}} not an exact science. Decompression models {{approximate}} a physiological process that is incompletely understood, and rather complex, by simple mathematical models, {{in the hope of}} producing a useful procedure with acceptably low risk of injury to the user. New information allows theories and models to be modified to provide <b>more</b> <b>reliable</b> results, and the availability of faster and more powerful computer processors at low cost has made more exhaustive numerical methods more practicable, and the computation of relatively far more complex models is now quite possible, even in real time.|$|E
50|$|Cloud {{communications}} providers deliver {{voice and}} data communications applications and services, hosting them on servers that the providers own and maintain, giving their customers {{access to the}} “cloud.” Because they only pay for services or applications they use, customers have a <b>more</b> cost-effective, <b>reliable</b> and secure communications environment, without the headaches associated with more conventional PBX system deployment.|$|R
50|$|As {{late as the}} 1650s, most {{troops were}} mercenaries. However, after the 17th century, most states {{invested}} in better disciplined and <b>more</b> politically <b>reliable</b> permanent troops. For a time mercenaries became important as trainers and administrators, but soon these tasks were also taken by the state. The massive size of these armies required a large supporting force of administrators.|$|R
