5|$|It {{was some}} time {{afterward}} when the thought flashed upon <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> that the disturbances I had observed {{might be due}} to an intelligent control. Although I could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for me to think of them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.|$|E

5|$|My factual {{position}} in the case {{as well as in}} the world of science of today does not permit me to enter the case against the Food and Drug Administration, since such action would, in <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> imply admission of the authority of this special branch of the government to pass judgment on primordial, pre-atomic cosmic orgone energy. I, therefore, rest the case in full confidence in your hands.|$|E
5|$|There {{is not the}} {{slightest}} doubt in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> that this brainy man was hoodwinked, and that his confidence was betrayed by the so-called mediums that he tested. His powers of observation were blinded and his reasoning faculties so blunted by his prejudice in favor of anything psychic or occult that he could not, or would not, resist the influence.|$|E

5|$|Your Honor, {{years ago}} I {{recognized}} my kinship with all living beings, and I made up <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> that I {{was not one}} bit better than the meanest on earth.

5|$|God by {{a sudden}} {{conversion}} subdued and brought <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> to a teachable frame, which was more hardened in such matters than {{might have been expected}} from one at my early period of life.

5|$|In writing these {{desultory}} letters, I found I {{could not}} avoid being continually {{the first person}} – 'the little hero of each tale.' I tried to correct this fault, if it be one, for they were designed for publication; but in proportion as I arranged my thoughts, my letter, I found, became stiff and affected: I, therefore, determined to let my remarks and reflections flow unrestrained, as I perceived that I could not give a just description of what I saw, but by relating the effect different objects had produced on <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> and feelings, whilst the impression was still fresh.|$|E

5|$|In 1805, Messrs. Wood and Street, from Richmond, Va., {{found their}} way to Kentucky. Friendly {{considerations}} led me to patronize them. This was done through the solicitations of a young friend from Virginia. They commenced a paper, published in 1806, called the 'Western World.' Imbibing strong prejudices against slavery, perhaps from my mother's repeating, in my infancy, the nurse's songs composed by Cowper, designed to make such impressions. In June 1806, to the great astonishment of my friends, I left Kentucky, with all the flattering prospects a youth could have, and hastened to Ohio. Connecting circumstances, and from hints that fell from Wood and others, a deep impression had been made on <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> that an eventful period was fast approaching.|$|E
