40|$|Abstract—This paper {{focuses on}} maximum wind power extrac-tion for a wind energy {{conversion}} system composed of a wind tur-bine, a squirrel-cage induction generator, and a matrix converter (MC). At a given wind velocity, the mechanical power available from a wind turbine {{is a function of}} its shaft speed. In order to track maximum power, the MC adjusts the induction generator terminal frequency, and thus, the turbine shaft speed. The MC also adjusts the reactive power transfer at the grid interface to-ward voltage regulation or power factor correction. A maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm is included in the control system. Conclusions about the effectiveness of the proposed scheme are supported by analysis and simulation results.

However, the motor generator of the pumped charge station has high input voltage and heavy load, so in order to get grid connected safely, being soft started by a high voltage converter is necessary. In the view of the existing high voltage high power converters, only the voltage source inverter Multi-stage Series-connection high voltage frequency converters are suitable for this application, and this paper gives analysis of such converters. Based on Carrier Wave Phase-Shifted modulation, this paper proposes a multi-stage Series-connection high voltage frequency converter with balanced output power of the step-down transformer’s secondary windings, in which a winding burdens three symmetry three-phase to single-phase <b>MC</b> <b>outputs,</b> and the same phase <b>outputs</b> of the <b>MC</b> are cascaded at the secondary side of the transformers, letting out one phase of high-voltage AC output.

30|$|In this paper, we {{proposed}} a weighted SVM technique for detection of MC clusters in FFDM. In this approach, suspicious MC regions are first segmented with active contour, and then the regions are classified by a trained weighted SVM. The non-MC training samples are selected from the segmented regions, which can be better tuned to the whole procedure than random sampling. Mutual information criterion was used to select important features, and among the extracted 51 features, 22 features are selected and used in the training and test process. The training samples are weighted with the possibility and typicality value of a sample belonging to <b>MC</b> <b>output</b> by the novel introduction of possibilistic fuzzy c-means (PFCM) clustering. Experimental results with ROC and FROC analysis using a set of 410 FFDM mammograms demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed the standard unweighted SVM. The proposed weight scheme may be also applicable to other classifiers, such as random forest, and we will investigate these problems in the future. Besides, {{we will try to}} adapt the method for traditional film-scanned mammograms.|$|R

The proposed MC-ADT uses a matrix converter (MC) connected to a transformer inserted in series with the grid, and allows: 1) real-time voltage regulation of the low-voltage side of the MC-ADT, based on an adjustable reference value defined by the SG requirements and bounded by the standard values; 2) capability to regulate the LV grid voltage even in case of sags, voltage rises, and overvoltages in the transformer medium-voltage side; and 3) contribution to power factor correction in the MV side. The MC-ADT grid voltage regulators are synthesized, establishing the MC reference currents. To guarantee the tracking of the <b>MC</b> <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> reference currents, the space vector representation, together with sliding-mode direct control techniques, are used.

In addition, GCs mediated inhibition in the OB is precisely controlled by an extensive centrifugal innervation. For example, cortical feedback projections and neuromodulatory afferents originating in the midbrain and basal forebrain excite GC, inhibiting MCs' and decreasing their output. Regulation of of GCs by inhibition has also been reported, however, the source of this inhibition and its relevance to olfactory processing is not known.

In this talk I show how - nevertheless - some concrete statements on m_t^ MC can be deduced assuming that the MC generator behaves like a rigorous first principles QCD calculator for the observables that are used for the analyses. I give simple conceptual arguments showing that in this context m_t^ MC can be interpreted like the mass of a heavy-light top meson, {{and that there is}} a conversion relation to field theory top quark masses that requires a non-perturbative input. The situation is in analogy to B physics where a similar relation exists between experimental B meson masses and field theory bottom masses.

In other words, this proposed method use the advantages of both DTC method and MCs. Simulation results show the effectiveness of presented method...|$|R
40|$|The major {{challenge}} in the aerospace industry represents the design of technologies and electrically powered systems to improve the performances of tomorrow`s aircraft. In the last 30 years significant researches are made to increase the overall reliability, availability, efficiency, maintainability and operational costs {{for the next generation}} of aircrafts. The general requirements of these power circuits are: the system must be fault tolerant with ability to continue operating properly (possibly at a reduced level) in case of a failure, the systems must have small size, low weight and must work in harsh conditions such as high temperature, humidity, vibrations and low maintenance. Matrix Converter is an "all silicon" solution which can direct connect an AC source to an AC load without the need of DC-link electrolytic capacitor. This AC to AC topology is a very promising alternative topology which can replace the actual two step power conversion solution, AC to DC to AC. The advantages of this topology are related to the lack of DC-link electrolytic capacitor, high output voltage quality, high input current quality, power factor control, high dynamic response, four quadrant operation, low current and low voltage stress of bidirectional switches. Despite these advantages, their market penetration is quite low, mainly due to their poor voltage transfer ratio, complexity in terms of structure and control, higher sensibility to input disturbances and its load parameter dependent. The main goal of this work is to design and implement a MC topology which can be used for aircraft applications. The thesis is divided into 6 chapters and in the end are presented the conclusions, appendices and references. In Chapter 1 the research starts with the presentation of the actual electrical system of an aircraft Boeing 787 and continues with the presentation of possible topologies which can be true fault tolerant. Next, a comparison is made between the most suitable topologies which can be used in AC to AC power conversion (MC and V-BBC) from the power components needed point of view for a three-phase load. The Chapter 2 is dedicated to MC study and analysis. Within this part, are presented the most used MC topology structures (DMC and IMC). An important part of the study is focused on bidirectional switches arrangement, safe commutation methods for bidirectional switches and control methods which can be applied. Next, in Chapter 3 the study continues with <b>MC</b> <b>input</b> filter design. <b>MC</b> is a direct AC to AC power conversion and because of this, special protection circuits are designed. An important part of the chapter is accorded to power switches selection and currents, voltages and temperature measurement circuits. In Chapter, 4 the DMC is simulated for two different control methods, 2 L-PWM and DSVM. The simulations are made for two types of source frequencies, 50 Hz and 400 Hz on a RL load. Chapter 5 contains the electrical circuit schemes and the layout of the DMC "Main Board" and "Driver Board" which are used in prototype realization. Chapter 6 is divided into experimental test results for individual components and experimental results of DMC with DSVM algorithm for both source frequencies, 50 Hz and 400 Hz. Finally, at the end of the thesis are presented the conclusions drawn from this research and recommendations for future work which must be done to improve the waveforms quality. In the appendices sections is presented the code used in Matlab-Simulink for both simulations and also the LabVIEW implementation of the DSVM algorithm.

40|$|Moisture content (MC) {{of poultry}} manure or litter affects its ammonia (NH 3) {{emission}}s. Relating MC to ammonia emission of manure or litter is thus {{of importance to}} modeling and/or managing ammonia emissions from the manure sources. Development of such relationships would require the knowledge of ammonia emission and the concomitant MC of the manure or litter. This work was carried out to characterize the operational performance of a commercially available soil MC sensor for measuring MC of meat-bird (broiler and turkey) litters and laying-hen manure. Laboratory and field calibration tests of the sensor <b>output</b> vs. <b>MC</b> of the source were conducted for the meat-bird litters and layer manure, respectively. Moisture content varied from 27. 1 % to 55. 5 % for the broiler litter, 22. 8 % to 56. 1 % for the turkey litter, and 11. 0 % to 75. 0 % for layer manure. Bulk density (BD) varied from 318 to 468 kg · m - 3 for the meat-bird litters. Sensitivity of the sensor to source temperature was also evaluated. Multivariate linear regression models were developed to relate the sensor EMF output to the litter or manure MC and BD (R 2 = 0. 95 – 0. 98). The impact of litter temperature on MC measurement by the sensor {{was found to be}} rather small, 0. 31 % of the measured mV per o C deviation from the mean operating temperature over the range of 4 o C to 24 o C. Results of the study indicate that when properly calibrated, the soil MC measurement sensor offers a reasonable means to quantify MC of poultry litter or manure on a real-time basis...|$|R
