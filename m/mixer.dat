50|$|Multiplicative <b>mixers</b> {{have been}} {{implemented}} {{in a wide variety}} of ways. The most popular are Gilbert cell <b>mixers,</b> diode <b>mixers,</b> diode ring <b>mixers</b> (ring modulation) and switching <b>mixers.</b> Diode <b>mixers</b> take advantage of the non-linearity of diode devices to produce the desired multiplication in the squared term. It is a very inefficient method as most of the power output is in other unwanted terms which need filtering out. Inexpensive AM radios still use diode <b>mixers.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{heterodyne}} technique {{is used for}} (1) shifting an input signal into a new frequency range as well as (2) amplifying a weak input signal (assuming use of an active <b>mixer).</b> A weak input signal of frequency f1 is mixed with a strong reference frequency f2 from a local oscillator (LO). The nonlinear combination of the input signals creates two new signals, one at the sum f1+f2 of the two frequencies, and the other at the difference f1−f2. These new frequencies are called heterodynes. Typically {{only one of the}} new frequencies is desired, and the other signal is filtered out of the output of the <b>mixer.</b> The output signal will have an intensity proportional to the product of the amplitudes of the input signals.|$|E

Arleen Chavez was the key hair stylist for the second season. Other make-up artists that contributed in the third season were Vincent Van Dyke, Allan Holt and Christopher Payne. The series production managers were unit production managar Carla Corwin and post-production supervisor Joy Ramos, who both depart from the series {{at the conclusion of the}} season, being replaced by unit production managar Jeff Rafner, production manager Chad Alber and production executive Tim Herbstrith. Second assistant directors since the inception of the series, Laura Petticord, Shawn Hanley and Chris Hayden returned to the series for the second season. The art department consisted of construction foreman Bob Huffman, set dressers Stacy Doran and Bruce Purcell, leadman Joseph W. Grafmuller, property master Angela M. Whiting, labor foreman Verne Hammond, art department coordinator Angela Trujillo, construction coordinator Curt Jones, set designer Yvonne Garnier-Hackl, stage foreman Tom Talley and paint foreman Alex Thompson. Joining the art department were set painter Shelley Adajian and assistant property masters Andrew Allen-King and Jeanne Bueche. However, the three new additions left the series after the production of the season finale, being temporarily replaced by Nicole Dome and T. Scott Elliott, who joined the team for two episodes. Sound editor Anthony Toretto, additional foley artist Mark McBryde, foley <b>mixer</b> Stacey Michaels, production sound <b>mixer</b> Brydon Baker III, foley artist Noel Vought, boom operator Kevin Maloney and sound re-recording mixers Todd Langer, Don Digirolamo, Pete Elia and Kurt Kassulke, the original members of the sound department, all returned for the second season. Production sound <b>mixer</b> Veda Campbell also returned, but departed after four episodes into the season, whereas assistant sound <b>mixer</b> Douglas J.

5|$|Another kashrut {{challenge}} {{which the}} bakery overcame {{in the early}} 1950s concerned the ability to produce fresh bread for sale on Sunday mornings after the plant had been closed for Shabbat in accordance with Jewish law.

Today Angel Bakeries owns nine such mixers, five of which are used in its Jerusalem plant.|$|E
5|$|Frith {{recorded}} the album at David Vorhaus's Kaleidophon Studios in London on 11–13 and 15 July 1974, {{where he played}} a modified 1936 Gibson K-11. He added an extra pickup over the strings at the nut, enabling him to amplify sound {{from both sides of}} the fretted note. He then split the fretboard in two with a capo, effectively giving him two guitars, each amplified separately that he could play independently with each hand. To split the sounds further he attached alligator clips at various positions on the strings. The net result was a guitar with multiple sound sources that could be channelled to a <b>mixer</b> and distributed across the stereo soundscape.|$|E

Manson, Trent Reznor and frequent Nine Inch Nails <b>mixer</b> Sean Beavan produced the record, alongside former Skinny Puppy member and longtime producer Dave Ogilvie. The process of creating the album was reputedly a long and difficult one, highlighted by experiments involving sleep deprivation, near-constant drug use, as well as self-harm, with Manson indicating that he would regularly insert sewing needles underneath his own fingernails.

The fundamentals of the process of the synthetic sand rebonding with bentonite require determination and description of operations, like disaggregation, even distribution of binder and water within the entire volume of the rebonded sand batch, sand grains coating, binder activation and aeration.
