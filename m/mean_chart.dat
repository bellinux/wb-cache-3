Many meteorological records (since the beginning of observations at Syowa Station) were set during this period. Especially, July 1990 was the month when the most significant weather occurred. The extreme records in July 1990 are the following. Number of blizzards 9 times, most frequent Days of blizzards 18 days, most frequent Monthly mean temperature - 11. 0 ℃, warmest Maximum temperature - 2. 5 ℃, warmest Monthly mean wind speed 12. 0 m/s, strongest The weather in July 1990 was characterized by strong wind and high temperature. Strong wind was brought by cyclones and fronts which approached and passed Syowa Station one after another. High temperature was associated with strong wind which destroyed the surface inversion layer. Why did cyclones and fronts approach Syowa Station so frequently? Judging from the southern hemispheric monthly <b>mean</b> <b>chart</b> of 500 hPa height in July, the circulation with a wave number of three prevailed; {{one of the three}} vortices was just west of Syowa Station. The monthly <b>mean</b> <b>chart</b> of surface pressure in July shows a low pressure field under the polar vortex of 500 hPa. Syowa Station was in this low pressure field, so cyclones and fronts easily invaded high latitude.

40|$|Intrusion {{detection}} systems (IDS) have a {{vital role}} in protecting computer networks and information systems. In this thesis we applied an SPC monitoring concept to a certain type of traffic data in order to detect a network intrusion. We developed a general SPC intrusion detection approach and described it and the source and the preparation of data used in this thesis. We extracted sample data sets that represent various situations, calculated event intensities for each situation, and stored these sample data sets in the data repository for use in future research. A regular batch <b>mean</b> <b>chart</b> was used to remove the sample datas inherent 60 -second cycles. However, this proved too slow in detecting a signal because the regular batch <b>mean</b> <b>chart</b> only monitored the statistic {{at the end of the}} batch. To gain faster results, a modified batch mean (MBM) chart was developed that met this goal. Subsequently, we developed the Modified Batch Mean Shewhart chart, the Modified Batch Mean Cusum chart, and the Modified Batch Mean EWMA chart and analyzed the performances of each one on simulated data. The simulation studies showed that the MBM charts perform especially well with large signals ?the type of signal typically associated with a DOS intrusion. The MBM Charts can be applied two ways: by using actual control limits or by using robust control limits. The actual control limits must be determined by simulation, but the robust control limits require nothing more than the use of the recommended limits. The robust MBM Shewhart chart was developed based on choosing appropriate values based on batch size. The robust MBM Cusum chart and robust MBM EWMA chart were developed on choosing appropriate values of charting parameters. Ph. D.

We proposed new color consistency checking formula in voxel coloring by using <b>mean</b> <b>charts.</b> Using this color consistency checking, the system do not require to be given parameters as constant threshold input and the system can reconstruct more detail than using original color consistency checking formula using threshold on standard deviation of image pixels value. Photorealistic 3 D object reconstruction is an active area in computer graphics. Input of this system is multiple photographs which are taken from multiple view points of scene. And then the object in the photographs will be projected back to the 3 D coordinate and applied voxel coloring method to reconstruct and view the object in 3 D. Voxel coloring works by discretizing scene space into voxels, the smallest unit in 3 D, then traversed and colored in specific order. The output of voxel coloring {{is a collection of}} voxels that represent the object. Those voxels can be rendered to get a new view of that object. To determine whether voxel has to be colored or be emptied, some color consistency checking formula must be used. The original color consistency checking formula is standard deviation calculation of all image pixels which voxel has been projected and compare it with constant threshold which is defined by user. This constant threshold must be chosen carefully because wrong value can cause defect reconstruction. We propose new color consistency checking using <b>mean</b> <b>charts</b> which do not require user to choose constant threshold input...|$|R

40|$|Control chart is {{the most}} widely used tools for {{statistical}} process control. For detecting shift in process <b>mean,</b> <b>chart</b> is the simplest and most commonly used. Control chart should be designed economically in order to achieve minimum quality control costs. The major function of control chart is to detect the occurrence of assignable causes so that the necessary corrective action can be taken before a large quantity of nonconforming product is manufactured. The control chart dominates the use of any other control chart technique if quality is measured on a continuous scale. The design of a control chart refers to the selection of three parameters i. e., sample size, width of control limit, and interval between samples. Economic design of control chart has gained considerable importance in providing better quality of end products to customer at less cost. In the present work, a computer programme in C language based on a non-traditional optimization technique namely particle swarm optimization has been developed for the economic design of the control chart giving the optimum values of the sample size, sampling interval and width of control limits such that the expected total cost per hour is minimized. The results obtained are found to be better compared to that reported in the literature...|$|E

This study assessed outcomes and their association with defined HbA 1 c thresholds and age ranges in insulin-treated, elderly, patients with T 2 DM in long-term care (LTC). DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of medical charts and the Minimum Data Set (MDS) for the period September 2010 through September 2011. SETTING: A total of 117 nursing homes in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Eligible patients had resided in LTC for 3 months or more, had at least 1 full MDS assessment, 2 or more records of insulin dispensing with no pump use, and 1 or more HbA 1 c measurements. MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes that were measured included hypoglycemia, ketoacidosis, infections, falls, hospitalization, and emergency room (ER) visits. RESULTS: A total of 583 patients were included (mean age 78. 9 years, <b>mean</b> <b>chart</b> observation length 55 days). In all groups, hypoglycemia was lowest in patients with an HbA 1 c level higher than 9. 0 %. In patients 75 years or older, infection rates were highest when HbA 1 c levels were higher than 9. 0 %. Falls increased by HbA 1 c level in patients aged 65 to 74 years, but decreased by HbA 1 c levels in patients 85 years or older. Ketoacidosis, hospitalization, and ER visits were low in all groups.
