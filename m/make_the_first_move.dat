5|$|The British {{commander-in-chief}} in North America, Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost, had forbidden any offensive {{action on}} the Niagara Frontier. This left the local British forces with {{no alternative but to}} wait for the Americans to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>move</b> and try to counter any attempt at invasion. The regular troops were distributed among the defensive outposts and supplemented with militia and Native American forces.|$|E
5|$|During Roosevelt's fifteen months {{beyond the}} Atlantic, from March 1909 to June 1910, neither man wrote {{much to the}} other. Taft biographer Lurie {{suggested}} that each expected the other to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>move</b> to re-establish their relationship on a new footing. Upon Roosevelt's triumphant return, Taft invited him {{to stay at the}} White House. The former president declined, and in private letters to friends expressed dissatisfaction at Taft's performance. Nevertheless, he wrote that he expected Taft to be renominated by the Republicans in 1912, and did not speak of himself as a candidate.|$|E
5|$|Most gunfights {{are portrayed}} in films or books as having two men square off, waiting {{for one to}} <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>move.</b> This was rarely the case. Often, a gunfight was spur-of-the-moment, with one drawing his pistol, and the other reacting. Often it would develop into a shootout where both men bolted for cover. In popular folklore, men who held {{noteworthy}} reputations as a gunfighter were eager to match up against another gunman with the same reputation. On the contrary, in cases where two men held a similar reputation, both would avoid confrontation with one another whenever possible. They rarely took undue risks, and usually weighed their options before confronting another well-known gunman. This respect for one another is why most famous gunfights were rarely two or more well-known gunmen matched up against one another, but rather one notable gunman against a lesser-known opponent or opponents.|$|E

5|$|Vorenus and Pullo set off {{in search}} of the eagle, encountering and rescuing Octavian from his captors. Octavian thanks them and {{promises}} that they will be rewarded. Vorenus and Pullo discover Pompey's slave with the eagle hiding in the bandit cart and kill him, realizing the bandits were hired by Pompey. A politically astute Octavian explains that their mission is only a gesture, since the theft of the eagle is actually a blessing in disguise to Caesar. Civil war between Caesar and Pompey is inevitable, but Caesar needs Pompey to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>move</b> so as not to appear the aggressor; Pompey is likely to do that if he believes Caesar's soldiers {{are on the verge of}} desertion. The trio returns in triumph to camp, where a surprised yet grateful Caesar takes the eagle back and more than adequate proof of Pompey's hostility. He sends Pompey the head of his slave and informs him of his next move, to winter the 13th Legion at Ravenna on the Italian border, in preparation for pressing his rights to the Consulship. Pompey breaks all ties with Caesar and takes Cornelia as his wife. Octavia, humiliated at being used by Pompey and heartbroken over her pointless divorce, says she wants him dead.|$|E
5|$|In 1809, Napoleon I of France {{arrived at}} Schönbrunn Palace {{to play the}} Turk. According to an {{eyewitness}} report, Mälzel took responsibility {{for the construction of}} the machine while preparing the game, and the Turk (Johann Baptist Allgaier) saluted Napoleon {{before the start of the}} match. The details of the match have been published over the years in numerous accounts, many of them contradictory. According to Bradley Ewart, it is believed that the Turk sat at its cabinet, and Napoleon sat at a separate chess table. Napoleon's table was in a roped-off area and he was not allowed to cross into the Turk's area, with Mälzel crossing back and forth to make each player's move and allowing a clear view for the spectators. In a surprise move, Napoleon took the first turn instead of allowing the Turk to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>move,</b> as was usual; but Mälzel allowed the game to continue. Shortly thereafter, Napoleon attempted an illegal move. Upon noticing the move, the Turk returned the piece to its original spot and continued the game. Napoleon attempted the illegal move a second time, and the Turk responded by removing the piece from the board entirely and taking its turn. Napoleon then attempted the move a third time, the Turk responding with a sweep of its arm, knocking all the pieces off the board. Napoleon was reportedly amused, and then played a real game with the machine, completing nineteen moves before tipping over his king in surrender. Alternate versions of the story include Napoleon being unhappy about losing to the machine, playing the machine at a later time, playing one match with a magnet on the board, and playing a match with a shawl around the head and body of the Turk in an attempt to obscure its vision.|$|E

25|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{player to}} <b>move</b> in Hex has a {{distinct}} advantage, the pie rule is generally implemented for fairness.

25|$|In Last Human (1995), Rimmer's {{one-night stand}} with Yvonne McGruder {{led to the}} birth of a son. Also, {{apparently}} there truly was mutual attraction, but both decided to wait for the other to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>move</b> after that one night, leading to their going separate ways. Yvonne transferred off Red Dwarf.|$|E
25|$|A chess {{clock is}} a clock with two {{separate}} time displays of which only one display can be running at a time. The {{player with the}} black pieces will initiate their opponent's timer {{at the start of}} the game. Thus the player with the white pieces will have their timer running first, and will <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>move.</b> The player or the arbiter may end the game at any time after the player's opponent has oversteped their time limit. If a timed out clock remains unnoticed, the game will continue as normal. If the game needs to be interrupted, the arbiter shall stop the clock.|$|E
500|$|In Sonic Boom, {{although}} the two have very strong and obvious feelings for each other, they attempt to conceal them at every possibility. Sonic has a framed portrait of Amy in his home, while Amy carries a picture of Sonic in her purse. Whenever {{one of the two}} shows even the slightest attraction towards anyone else, the other becomes immensely jealous. These hidden feelings are often played with and made to be points of humor and entertainment in the series. In the episode [...] "Tails' Crush", Sonic reveals to Tails that his strategy to attract potential romantic interests is to simply act aloof and disinterested, while Amy tells Tails that she's partial to knightly and chivalrous behavior (and thus is likely waiting for Sonic to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>move).</b> Hence, the two have yet to make their feelings evident.|$|E
5000|$|Josen (定先) is the go term {{describing}} the phase {{in a series}} of matches between two players - such as a jubango, where one player takes Black (<b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>move)</b> throughout. One says also [...] "playing at sen", or a [...] "one-stone-handicap game".|$|R

2500|$|In March 1923 a {{petition}} for reunion among Liberal backbenchers received 73 signatures, {{backed by the}} Lloyd Georgeite [...] "Daily Chronicle" [...] and the Asquithian [...] "Liberal Magazine". But reunion was opposed by senior Asquithian Liberals like Sir John Simon, Viscount Gladstone and Charles Masterman, and as late as 30 June by journalists such as Massingham and Gardiner of [...] "The Nation". By July Asquith was friendly to Lloyd George and conferred with him, but excluded him from the Shadow Cabinet just as Campbell-Bannerman had sometimes excluded Asquith and the other Liberal Imperialists {{at the time of}} the Boer War. Asquith wanted Lloyd George to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>move</b> but although he put out feelers to senior Asquith supporters he insisted that he was [...] "neither a suppliant nor a penitent". Viscount Gladstone felt that [...] "it was generally recognised that Asquith was no longer effective as an active leader" [...] but that Lloyd George must not succeed him.|$|E
2500|$|The {{historian}} G.E. Harvey {{noted that}} Nanda was [...] "saddled with an impossible legacy" [...] of the holding the empire together, and his [...] "one hope {{of keeping the}} country together was to evacuate Siam and retrench in every direction." [...] Without the benefit of hindsight, Nanda would try {{to hold on to}} the [...] "impossible legacy". He spent the first months of his reign reaffirming the loyalty of the vassal rulers to him. For their part, the vassal rulers, who governed what used to be sovereign states as recently as only a few decades ago, would break away at any first hint of weakness. But no one was yet ready to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>move</b> against Nanda, an experienced military commander in his own right, and adopted a [...] "wait-and-see attitude". By May 1582, all the key vassal rulers, including the ruler of Siam, the most powerful vassal state, had sent tribute. Even King Min Phalaung of Arakan, half of whose kingdom was under Toungoo occupation in 1580–81, sent an embassy in early 1583 to Pegu to offer a truce between the two kingdoms, to which Nanda agreed.|$|E
60|$|The {{first move}} may {{be decided in}} any way that is {{agreeable}} to both players; after the first game the winner of the preceding game moves first if he chooses, or may instruct his opponent to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>move.</b>|$|E
50|$|Black (<b>the</b> {{player who}} <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>move)</b> was long {{known to have}} a big advantage, even before L.

50|$|If the {{collision}} rule mentioned above is used, {{there is still}} a considerable advantage in moving first. This may be partially counterbalanced by having the players choose their individual starting points in reverse order. E.g., first C chooses a start point, then B, then A.

5|$|The first-move {{advantage}} in chess is the inherent {{advantage of the}} player (White) who <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>move</b> in chess. Chess players and theorists generally agree that White begins the game with some advantage. Since 1851, compiled statistics support this view; White consistently wins slightly more often than Black, usually scoring between 52 and 56percent. White's winning percentage {{is about the same}} for tournament games between humans and games between computers. However, White's advantage is less significant in blitz games and games between novices.|$|R
60|$|As Miss Lamb had 'enjoyed' the story, {{this speech}} {{was not exactly}} {{grateful}} or complimentary.

He could not have said just what he had expected, but {{certainly}} Reggie's revelations had prepared him for something rather warmer, something more in the style in which a girl would write to the man she loved. The next moment, however, he saw how foolish any such expectation had been. How on earth could any reasonable man expect a girl to let herself go {{at this stage of the}} proceedings? It was for him to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>move.</b> Naturally she wasn't going to reveal her feelings until he had revealed his.|$|E
