5|$|During a Nintendo Treehouse Live webcast at E3 2017, {{a remake}} of Superstar Saga for Nintendo 3DS, titled Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions, was announced. The port {{features}} updated graphics, maintaining the use of sprites but with additional lighting effects, akin to Dream Team and Paper Jam. The port also adds an additional storyline, <b>Minion</b> Quest: The Search for Bowser, which follows Captain Goomba and features different gameplay mechanics. The game also features Amiibo functions, tied to the existing Boo and new Goomba and Koopa Troopa figures. The game was released worldwide on October 6, 2017.|$|E
5|$|In 1593 {{there was}} a fresh crisis with Spain and the brass guns needed for the English navy were in short supply. Brass {{artillery}} pieces were therefore rounded up from the forts along the south coast, including Camber. The number of guns at the castle remained around the same, but the larger, brass culverins and demi-cannon were removed, being replaced with smaller iron demi-culverins, sakers and a <b>minion.</b> In 1594 another royal survey suggested that £95 of repair work was needed on the fortifications.|$|E
5|$|Repairs {{were made}} to the castle between 1610 and 1611 by the captain, Sir George Bampfield, at a cost of £211. A survey in 1623 carried out by Sir Richard Morryson showed the castle to be {{equipped}} with ten iron guns – one culverin, five demi-culverins, two sakers, a <b>minion</b> and a falcon – and garrisoned by its captain, five gunners and three soldiers. It was in a poor condition, and one corner of the gun platform had been undermined by the sea; Morryson's team estimated the likely costs of repairs to amount to £459.|$|E

Levant is a young Cocoon Master, whose job is to capture and purify the <b>Minions.</b> The <b>Minions</b> can then be used to fight and defend Levant, spun into silk for money, or fused with other <b>Minions</b> to form more powerful combinations. As Levant captures more <b>minions,</b> his [...] "Capture Level" [...] increases, allowing him to capture monsters more easily.|$|R

5|$|Sandgate was {{completed}} by the autumn of 1540; Henry may {{have come to the}} castle when he was visiting Folkestone in May 1542. Elizabeth I visited the fortification in 1573, and also used it to imprison the courtier Thomas Keyes for a period, after he married Lady Mary Grey against the Queen's wishes. In 1593, the castle was reported to be equipped with seven artillery pieces - one culverin, two demi-culverins, three sakers and one <b>minion</b> - along with muskets, bows and arrows.|$|E

5|$|Walmer {{was built}} between April 1539 and autumn 1540, {{by a team}} {{including}} Richard Benese as the surveyor, William Clement as the master carpenter, and Christopher Dickenson as the master mason. It was initially garrisoned by a captain, two lieutenants, two porters, ten gunners and three soldiers, at an annual cost of £174. It was probably equipped {{with a range of}} brass and cast-iron guns, along with arquebuses and bows for close defence. In 1597, a report listed the castle's artillery as comprising a cannon, a culverin, five demi-culverins, a saker, a <b>minion</b> and a falcon.|$|E

5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in 1603 recorded that Upnor Castle had 20 guns of various calibres, plus another 11 guns split between two sconces or outworks, known as Bay and Warham Sconces. The castle's armament {{consisted of a}} demi-cannon, 7 culverin, 5 demi-culverin, a <b>minion,</b> a falconet, a saker, and four fowlers with two chambers each. Bay Sconce was armed with 4 demi-culverin, while Warham Sconce had 2 culverin and 5 demi-culverin. Eighteen guns were recorded as being mounted in the castle twenty years later. The garrison's armament included 34 longbows, an indication that archery was still of military value even at this late date. By this time, however, the castle {{was in a state}} of disrepair. The drawbridge and its raising mechanism were broken, the gun platforms needed repairs, and the courtyard wall had collapsed. A new curtain wall had to be built to protect the landward side of the castle. The foundations of Warham Sconce were reported to have been washed away by the tide, and it appears that both sconces were allowed to fall into ruin.|$|E
5|$|Doctor Neo Cortex is a mad {{scientist}} who captures Coco and Aku Aku {{and wants to}} use stolen Mojo to create an army of mutants. Uka Uka, who is also absent in the Nintendo DS version, is behind Cortex's plot for world domination; after tiring of Cortex's incompetence, Uka replaces him with his cyborg niece, Nina Cortex. Aiding the Cortexes are Doctor N. Gin, who is Cortex's hysterical right-hand man, and Tiny Tiger. Dingodile, another <b>minion</b> of Cortex, exclusively appears in the DS and Game Boy Advance versions of Crash of the Titans as a boss character. Aiding the villains {{are a number of}} small fodder enemies that attempt to hinder Crash in his journey. Each fodder is affiliated with a certain villain in the game. The first fodders encountered are Neo Cortex's Ratnicians, which appear as bipedal, chihuahua-like animals dressed as laboratory researchers. These characters appear in the first four episodes of the game, and are replaced by other enemies as the game progresses. The later enemies include Tiny Tiger's Southern-accented Koo-alas, Doctor N. Gin's monkey wrench-wielding Doom Monkeys, Uka Uka's spear-chucking Voodoo Bunnies, and Nina Cortex's Brat Girls. Radical Entertainment sought to give these minor characters personalities by giving them a large number of distinctive quotations.|$|E

5|$|The first Mortal Kombat game {{takes place}} in Earthrealm (Earth) where seven {{different}} warriors with their own reasons for entering participated in the tournament with the eventual prize being the continued freedom of their realm, threatened with a takeover by Outworld. Among the established warriors were Liu Kang, Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade. With {{the help of the}} thunder god Raiden, the Earthrealm warriors were victorious and Liu Kang became the new champion of Mortal Kombat. In Mortal Kombat II, unable to deal with his <b>minion</b> Shang Tsung's failure, Outworld Emperor Shao Kahn lures the Earthrealm warriors to the Outworld where the Earthrealm warriors eventually defeat Shao Kahn. By the time of Mortal Kombat 3, Shao Kahn revives Edenia's (now a part of his Outworld domain) former queen Sindel in Earthrealm, combining it with Outworld as well. He then attempts to invade Earthrealm but is ultimately defeated by the Earthrealm warriors again. After Kahn's defeat, Edenia was freed from Kahn's grasp and returned to a peaceful realm, ruled by Princess Kitana. The following game, Mortal Kombat 4, features the former elder god Shinnok attempting to conquer the realms and attempting to kill the thunder god Raiden. However, he is also defeated by the Earthrealm warriors.|$|E

They later join with Baby Wario and Baby Bowser, who offer their specialized abilities so that the group may proceed. However, Baby Wario's lust for treasure leads him to abandon his duties while Baby Bowser was captured by Kamek (who is actually the future Kamek that appears throughout the forts and castles), and later kicked out by the Adult Bowser, who came from the future, for his baby counterpart insults him. Baby Bowser then joined the group until he noticed Kamek and after him, leaving Yoshi and the other babies to continue their journey. Much later in the game, Kamek's sinister plan for kidnapping the babies around the world has been revealed. He and Bowser travels back in time in search of the star children—seven babies whose hearts possess unimaginable power necessary for him to conquer the universe. Despite kidnapping all of the babies, they couldn't find a single star child. Yoshi's group later arrives at Bowser's castle and Baby Wario and Baby Bowser, arguing for after the treasure from Bowser's castle. They later joined the group and as they arrived at the final room, Baby Bowser betrays them, claiming that Yoshi and the other babies wanted Bowser's treasure in his castle. Yoshi easily defeated him and Kamek arrives, along with Bowser, angered at what Yoshi did to his infant self. Despite this, the babies and Yoshis prevail, in both defeating Bowser, forces Kamek and Bowser retreats to their present time. Yoshi and the babies then retrieving Baby Luigi and the other babies. Bowser's castle then self-destructs but Yoshi and the other babies (with the help of the other storks carrying all of the babies) escaped unharmed and the storks continues to bring all the babies back to their respective home.|$|E
