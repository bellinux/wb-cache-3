5|$|As {{a natural}} side-effect {{of the size}} of the fuel {{elements}} and their resulting explosions, ICF designs use a very large reaction chamber many meters across. This lowers the neutron flux on any particular part of the chamber wall through the inverse square law. Additionally, there are no magnets or other complex systems near or inside the reactor, and the laser is isolated on the far side of long optical paths. The far side of the chamber is empty, allowing the blanket to be placed there and easily maintained. Although the reaction chamber walls and final optics would eventually embrittle and require replacement, the chamber is essentially a large steel ball of relatively simple multi-piece construction that could be replaced without too much effort. The reaction chamber is, on the whole, dramatically simpler than those in <b>magnetic</b> <b>fusion</b> concepts, and the LIFE designs proposed building several and quickly moving them in and out of production.|$|E

25|$|During {{his career}} in academia, Conn {{published}} more than 300 journal articles, conference papers, book chapters and op-eds related to fusion energy science and engineering. Among them was a 216-page book chapter on <b>magnetic</b> <b>fusion</b> reactors in the 1981 book “Fusion,” which was edited by the physicist Edward Teller.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, Conn left Wisconsin to {{join the}} University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he {{continued}} research in plasma physics and nuclear fusion, {{as well as in}} materials science and energy policy. While at UCLA Conn led the establishment in 1986 of the Institute of Plasma and Fusion Research, and served as its founding director. It was during this time that Conn began more extensively to advise the federal government on fusion energy, specifically for the United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology and the Department of Energy’s <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Fusion</b> Advisory Committee, among other governmental bodies. At UCLA Conn and his colleague, Farrokh Najmabadi, directed a national U.S. Department of Energy program known as ARIES, which prepared conceptual designs of possible fusion energy power plants. Conn also {{played a key role in}} the creation of PISCES, a laboratory research facility located first at UCLA and today at UC San Diego. The lab studies what happens when very high temperature plasma comes into contact with the material world, such as plasma chamber walls, as would occur inside a <b>magnetic</b> <b>fusion</b> reactor. Conn further led the formation of a multi-lateral experiment program, the Advanced Limiter Test or ALT program, that studied plasma as it interacts with components inside a tokamak fusion experiment, in this case the former TEXTOR tokamak machine at Germany’s largest national laboratory, the Forschungszentrum Jülich. The countries participating included Germany, Japan, Belgium, and the United States. In 1991, Conn became chair of the newly formed Fusion Energy Advisory Committee (FEAC) at the U.S. Department of Energy.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, the EC, Japan, United States, and USSR {{joined in}} the International Tokamak Reactor (INTOR) Workshop, {{under the auspices of}} the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to assess the {{readiness}} of <b>magnetic</b> <b>fusion</b> to move forward to the experimental power reactor (EPR) stage, to identify the additional R that must be undertaken, and to define the characteristics of such an EPR by means of a conceptual design. Hundreds of fusion scientists and engineers in each participating country took part in a detailed assessment of the then present status of the tokamak confinement concept vis-a-vis the requirements of an EPR, identified the required R by early 1980, and produced a conceptual design by mid-1981.|$|E

50|$|Unlike other <b>magnetic</b> {{confinement}} <b>fusion</b> {{devices such}} as the tokamak, FRCs provide a magnetic field topology whereby the axial field inside the reactor is reversed by eddy currents in the plasma, {{as compared to the}} ambient magnetic field externally applied by solenoids. The FRC is less prone to magnetohydrodynamic and plasma instabilities than other <b>magnetic</b> confinement <b>fusion</b> methods. The science behind the colliding beam fusion reactor is used in TAE's C-2, C-2U and C-2W projects.|$|R

The proposed device has the unusual property that it can avoid both the cusp losses of traditional <b>magnetic</b> <b>fusion</b> systems and the grid losses of traditional IEC configurations.|$|E

York {{and the new}} lab embraced the Lawrence [...] "big science" [...] approach, tackling challenging projects with physicists, chemists, engineers, and computational scientists working together in multidisciplinary teams. Lawrence died in August 1958 and shortly after, the university's board of regents named both laboratories for him, as the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory.|$|E
