However, the decentralized and decarbonized energy future leads to the shortfall of energy supply to meet the demand, the conflicts between economic development and environmental protection, and the unbalance between resource location and load distribution [1]. The electricity industry has paid increasing attention to the distributed energy resources (DERs) and used them to address and overcome these challenges. Typically, DERs are connected to the middle-low voltage distribution networks and serve as the power supply for local demand [2, 3].|$|R

40|$|The way {{motion is}} {{generated}} and controlled in robotics {{has traditionally been}} based on a philosophy of rigidity, where movements are tightly controlled and external influences are ironed out. More recent research into autonomous robots, biological actuation and human machine interaction has uncovered the value of compliant mechanisms in both aiding the production of effective, adaptive and efficient behaviour, and increasing the <b>margins</b> <b>for</b> <b>safety</b> in machines that operate alongside people. Various actuation methods have previously been proposed that allow robotic systems to exploit rather than avoid the influences of external perturbations, {{but many of these}} devices can be complex and costly to engineer, and are often task specific. This thesis documents the development of a general purpose modular actuator that can emulate the behaviour of various spring damping systems. It builds on some of the work done to produce reliable force controlled electronic actuators by developing a low cost implementation of an existing force actuator, and combining it with a novel high level control structure running in software on an embedded microcontroller. The actuator hardware with its embedded software results in a compact modular device capable of approximating the behaviour of various mechanical systems and actuation devices. Specifying these behaviours is achieved with an intuitive user interface and a control system based on a concept called profile groups. Profile group configurations that specify complex mechanical behaviours can be rapidly designed and the resulting configurations downloaded for a device to emulate. The novel control system and intuitive user interface developed to facilitate the rapid prototyping of mechanical behaviours are explained in detail. Two prototype devices are demonstrated emulating a number of mechanical systems and the results are compared to mechanical counterparts. Performance issues are discussed and some solutions proposed alongside general improvements to the control system. The applications beyond robotics are also explored.

He sought to determine what effects radium had on the human body. These studies included the body’s metabolism, the hazards, and how to minimize any harmful side effects.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{incidence}} of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) arising around dental implants will increase {{because of the}} rising popularity of dental implants. In this case, a novel surgical treatment of an OSCC {{in the vicinity of}} endosseous implants is reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a 69 -year-old woman, a recurrent OSCC (cTNM) developed in the floor of the mouth extending to the attached keratinized peri-implant mucosa of both interforaminal-placed dental implants. Radiographically, no bone invasion could be observed. RESULTS: To radically remove the tumor, a marginal mandibulectomy was performed including the cranial parts of both dental implants by cutting them into two parts. Three years after tumor resection and one year after reimplantation, the patient is disease free and has a good oral function. CONCLUSIONS: In case of an OSCC, traditional bone and soft <b>margins</b> <b>for</b> oncologic <b>safety</b> are 1. 0 cm. If a dental implant is present within this safety zone, on condition, there is no massive bone invasion, and the original mandible has sufficient vertical height; a marginal mandibulectomy including part of the implants can be considered...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this letter is to inform NRC of changes that we have {{incorporated}} into the TRM. Specifically, TRM Revision 8 added the requirements for electrical equipment protective devices. This revision was performed in conjunction with Sequoyah Technical Specifications Amendments 250 and 241 for Units 1 and 2, respectively, and provided for the relocation of these requirements to the TRM. Revision 9 of the TRM added a more conservative requirement for the reactor coolant system specific activity average limit.

5000|$|Tryon led one {{column of}} six ships, which formed the first {{division}} of his fleet, in his flagship Victoria travelling at 8 kn. His deputy — Rear-Admiral Albert Hastings Markham — {{was in the}} lead ship of the second division of five ships, the 10600 LT Camperdown. Markham's normal divisional flagship — [...] — was being refitted. Unusually for Tryon, he had discussed his plans for anchoring the fleet {{with some of his}} officers. The fleet were to turn inwards in succession by 180°, thus closing to 400 yd and reversing their direction of travel. After travelling a few miles in this formation, the whole fleet would slow and simultaneously turn 90° to port and drop their anchors for the night. The officers had observed that 1200 yd was much too close and suggested that the columns should start at least 1600 yd apart; even this would leave insufficient <b>margin</b> <b>for</b> <b>safety.</b> The normal turning circles of the ships involved would have meant that a gap between the two columns of 2000 yd would be needed to leave a space between the columns of 400 yd on completion of the manoeuvre. Tryon had confirmed that eight cables 1300 m should be needed for the manoeuvre the officers expected, but had later signalled for the columns to close to six cables 1000 m. Two of his officers gingerly queried whether the order was what he intended, and he brusquely confirmed that it was.He ordered speed to be increased to 8.8 kn and at about 15:00 ordered a signal to be flown from Victoria to have the ships in each column turn in succession by 180° inwards towards the other column so that the fleet would reverse its course. However, the normal [...] "tactical" [...] turning circle of the ships had a diameter of around 800 yd each (and a minimum of 600 yd, although standing orders required [...] "tactical rudder" [...] to be used in fleet manoeuvres), so if they were less than 1600 yd apart then a collision was likely.|$|E

40|$|The {{complement}} cascade includes heat-labile {{proteins and}} care is required when handling serum {{in order to}} preserve its functional integrity. We have previously used a whole human serum bactericidal assay to show that antibody and an intact complement system are required in blood for killing of invasive isolates of Salmonella. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the conditions under which human serum can be stored and manipulated while maintaining complement integrity. Serum bactericidal activity against Salmonella was maintained for a minimum of 35 days when stored at 4 °C, eight days at 22 °C and 54 hours at 37 °C. Up to three freeze-thaw cycles had no effect on the persistence of bactericidal activity and hemolytic complement assays confirmed no effect on complement function. Delay in the separation of serum for up to four days from clotted blood stored at 22 °C did not affect bactericidal activity. Dilution of serum resulted in an increased rate of loss of bactericidal activity and so serum should be stored undiluted. These findings indicate that the current guidelines concerning manipulation and storage of human serum to preserve complement integrity and function leave a large <b>margin</b> <b>for</b> <b>safety</b> with regards to bactericidal activity against Salmonella.

It is unclear whether these chemicals are at concentrations that can elicit endocrine disruption in Australian fish species. In this study, native rainbowfish (Melanotaenia fluviatilis) and introduced invasive (but prevalent) mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) {{were exposed to the}} individual compounds atrazine, estrone, bisphenol A, propylparaben and pyrimethanil, and mixtures of compounds including hormones and personal care products, industrial compounds, and pesticides at environmentally relevant concentrations. Vitellogenin (Vtg) protein and liver Vtg mRNA induction were used to assess the estrogenic potential of these compounds. Vtg expression was significantly affected in both species exposed to estrone at concentrations that leave little <b>margin</b> <b>for</b> <b>safety</b> (p &lt; 0. 001). Propylparaben caused a small but statistically significant 3 × increase in Vtg protein levels (p = 0. 035) in rainbowfish but at a concentration 40 × higher than that measured in the environment, therefore propylparaben poses a low risk of inducing endocrine disruption in fish. Mixtures of pesticides and a mixture of hormones, pharmaceuticals, industrial compounds and pesticides induced a small but statistically significant increase in plasma Vtg in rainbowfish, but did not affect mosquitofish Vtg protein or mRNA expression. These results suggest that estrogenic activity represents a low risk to fish in most Australian rivers monitored to-date except for some species of fish at the most polluted sites...|$|E
