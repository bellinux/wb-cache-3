5|$|Dupuy de Lôme was {{designed}} to fill the commerce-raiding strategy of the Jeune École. Considered by some the first true armoured cruiser, she was superior to existing British and Italian protected cruisers, especially in her relatively thick steel armour. She could control the engagement range with her superior speed and her heavy armament of quick-firing guns, {{all of which were}} mounted in gun turrets, in <b>marked</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> her intended opponents who mounted their guns in lightly protected casemates or pivot mounts.|$|E
5|$|Offsetting these handicaps, the Prussian Army had {{excellent}} and professional leadership in its General Staff organisation. These officers came from four schools developed {{for this purpose}} and thus worked to a common standard of training. This system was in <b>marked</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the conflicting, vague orders issued by the French army. This staff system ensured that before Ligny, three-quarters of the Prussian army concentrated for battle with 24 hours notice.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months later}} in Rome, Caecilius {{and his family}} are shown to be successful; he is running a {{profitable}} business, Evelina has a social life in comparison to her seclusion in Pompeii, and his son Quintus is studying to become a doctor. Before Quintus leaves, he pays tribute to the family's household gods (in <b>marked</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> his disrespectful attitude towards them {{at the start of the}} episode), a bas relief depiction of which are in the form of the Doctor, Donna and the TARDIS.|$|E
25|$|Coral reef fishes {{exhibit a}} huge variety of {{dazzling}} and sometimes bizarre colours and patterns. This is in <b>marked</b> <b>contrasts</b> <b>to</b> open water fishes {{which are usually}} countershaded with silvery colours.|$|R
40|$|Structural {{properties}} of the bromocyclohexane/thiourea inclusion compound have been determined using both single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction over a range of temperatures above and below a first-order phase transition at 233 K in this material. The results demonstrate <b>marked</b> <b>contrasts</b> <b>to</b> the phase transition behavior in the prototypical cyclohexane/thiourea inclusion compound, demonstrating that relatively small changes in molecular geometry (in this case bromine substitution) can have a profound influence on the structural {{properties of}} the low-temperature phase in such material...|$|R
2500|$|It is {{the name}} of the lunar deity in Zoroastrianism. The Iranian word is feminine, and {{consequently}} the personification of the Moon is a goddess, as in Greco-Roman tradition but in <b>marked</b> <b>contrast</b> both <b>to</b> Vedic religion and to her Mesopotamian predecessor Sin. Although Mah is not a prominent deity in the Avestan scripture, her crescent was an important symbol of royal throughout the [...] Parthian and Sassanid periods.|$|R
5|$|Henry {{crossed the}} border in mid-August. Given-Wilson has noted the care Henry took not to ravage or pillage the {{countryside}} on their march through Berwickshire and Lothian. This was in <b>marked</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> previous expeditions, and Given-Wilson compares it specifically to the 'devastation wreacked' in last such campaign, by Richard II in 1385. This he puts this down to the presence in the English army of the earl of Dunbar, whose lands they were. Brown has suggested the king 'envisaged... a punitive expedition' with either a confrontation or such a chevauchée that the Scots would be eager to negotiate. In the event, they offered no resistance as the English army marched through Haddington.|$|E
5|$|Mesa Verde is {{best known}} for a large number of well-preserved cliff dwellings, houses built in alcoves, or rock {{overhangs}} along the canyon walls. The structures contained within these alcoves were mostly blocks of hard sandstone, held together and plastered with adobe mortar. Specific constructions had many similarities but were generally unique in form due to the individual topography of different alcoves along the canyon walls. In <b>marked</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas, the cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde reflected a region-wide trend towards the aggregation of growing regional populations into close, highly defensible quarters during the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|Swordfishs diving {{depth and}} time {{are not known}} because the records from her sea trials have not survived. Shutting down her boiler, {{retracting}} the funnel and sealing the boiler uptake required about {{a minute and a}} quarter, which included switching over to the electric motors. In <b>marked</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> contemporary Vickers designs much attention was paid to safety arrangements, including her extensive subdivision. Indicator and telephone buoys, which could be released from inside the submarine were provided together with external air connections and a charged high-pressure line which could provide air to any manned compartment or the living spaces. Furthermore, the main ballast tanks could be blown from either end of the ship.|$|E
5000|$|... ▪ Papa-Nnukwu is both {{father and}} {{grandfather}} in the Achike family, being Eugene and Ifeoma’s father. He is a kind, loving man rooted in the traditional non-Christian beliefs of his indigenous culture, presenting a <b>marked</b> <b>contrast,</b> in particular, <b>to</b> his son Eugene’s adherence to European religion and lifestyle.|$|R
50|$|Seirom {{is a dark}} ambient musical project {{started by}} Dutch multi-instrumentalist and {{composer}} Maurice de Jong, otherwise known as Mories. It was founded in 2011 and <b>marked</b> a stark <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> de Jong's previous work, embracing a more ethereal sound.|$|R
5000|$|Mångha (...) is the Avestan for [...] "Moon, month", {{equivalent}} to Persian Māh (Old Persian māha).It {{is the name}} of the lunar deity in Zoroastrianism. The Iranian word is feminine, and consequently the personification of the Moon is a goddess, as in Greco-Roman tradition but in <b>marked</b> <b>contrast</b> both <b>to</b> Vedic religion and to her Mesopotamian predecessor Sin. Although Mah is not a prominent deity in the Avestan scripture, her crescent was an important symbol of royal throughout the Parthian and Sassanid periods.|$|R
5|$|The first agreement, {{signed on}} 14 September 1937, {{included}} plans to counterattack aggressive submarines. Naval patrols were established; the United Kingdom and France were to patrol {{most of the}} western Mediterranean {{and parts of the}} east, and the other signatories were to patrol their own waters. Italy was to be allowed to join the agreement and patrol the Tyrrhenian Sea if it wished. A second agreement followed three days later, applying similar provisions to surface ships. Italy and Germany did not attend, although the former took up naval patrols in November. In <b>marked</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the actions of the Non-Intervention Committee and the League of Nations, this conference succeeded in preventing attacks by submarines.|$|E
5|$|The patrols were {{a strain}} on the Royal Navy and the {{provisions}} were relaxed with French agreement, effective from January. Submarine activity soon returned and full patrols were resumed in early February. On the whole, submarine activity during this period did not amount to much; patrols were again relaxed in May, and the agreement suspended in August. The success of the conference was in <b>marked</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> {{the failure of the}} Non-Intervention Committee. The Nationalists and Italians switched to using air power against shipping; at least one ship was sunk off the Spanish coast by aircraft in the final months of 1937.|$|E
5|$|As {{is common}} in {{frontier}} societies, the Southern Rhodesian settler community was mostly male: {{at the time of}} the First World War, white females were outnumbered by males almost two to one. Because white women were so marriageable and cheap black labour was easily available to handle domestic duties, most female settlers did not work and spent most of their days supervising the household and family. The average white woman in the colony continued to live this kind of life during the war, in <b>marked</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> her British counterpart, who in many cases went to replace the male factory workers and farm labourers who went to war. In Rhodesia little of this sort occurred: there were no munitions factories, and the idea of women working down the country's mines was not considered practical. Some white farmers' wives took over management of the land in their husbands' absence, but this was quite unusual.|$|E
50|$|Uzbekistan and Russia {{signed a}} mutual defence pact in 2005, that will also result in closer {{military}} cooperation. This <b>marked</b> a stark <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> {{a few years}} earlier, when the US appeared to be Uzbekistan's favoured foreign friend, and relations with Russia were cooler.|$|R
40|$|In περὶ ὕψους 4. 4, Immisch’s emendation οὐδὲν οὕτως... ὡς ἐν τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς ἰταμόν is correct. Τhe interjection Ἡράκλεις {{alludes to}} the fable of Heracles and the daughters of Thespius (Paus. 9. 26. 6 – 7, etc.). In 9. 11, ἀλλὰ γὰρ Ὅμηρος μὲν ἐνθάδε οὔριος does not {{introduce}} a new subject but <b>marks</b> a <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the preceding (Denniston GP 377) : “ [...] even if Zeus should oppose him. But /Homer/ is favourable here [...] . ”...|$|R
500|$|Robert L. Bonn, an author, {{described}} these trilogy {{of works}} as [...] "superb examples" [...] of anthropological paintings, and states that [...] "in three genre paintings Bruegel stands in <b>marked</b> <b>contrast</b> both <b>to</b> painters {{of his day}} and many others who followed." [...] Thomas Craven summarises The Wedding Dance as [...] "One of several celebrations of the joys of gluttony painted by Brueghel with bursting vitality". Walter S. Gibson, an art historian, also views the paintings as a [...] "sermon condemning gluttony" [...] and [...] "an allegory of the Church abandoned by Christ." ...|$|R
5|$|Consequently, by 1612–13, the Wodeyars {{exercised}} a {{great deal}} of autonomy and even though they acknowledged the nominal overlordship of the Aravidu dynasty, tributes and transfers of revenue to Chandragiri stopped. This was in <b>marked</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> other major chiefs Nayaks of Tamil country who continued to pay off Chandragiri emperors well into the 1630s. Chamaraja VI and Kanthirava Narasaraja I attempted to expand further northward but were thwarted by the Bijapur Sultanate and its Maratha subordinates, though the Bijapur armies under Ranadullah Khan were effectively repelled in their 1638 siege of Srirangapatna. Expansionist ambitions then turned southward into Tamil country where Narasaraja Wodeyar acquired Satyamangalam (in modern northern Coimbatore district) while his successor Dodda Devaraja Wodeyar expanded further to capture western Tamil regions of Erode and Dharmapuri, after successfully repulsing the chiefs of Madurai. The invasion of the Keladi Nayakas of Malnad was also dealt with successfully. This period was followed by one of complex geo-political changes, when in the 1670s, the Marathas and the Mughals pressed into the Deccan.|$|E
5|$|Hennig and Janensch, while {{grouping}} the dermal armour elements {{into four}} distinct types, recognised an apparently continuous change of shape among them, shorter and flatter plates {{at the front}} gradually merging into longer and more pointed spikes towards the rear, suggesting an uninterrupted distribution along the entire body, in fifteen pairs. Because each type of osteoderm was found in mirrored left and right versions, it seems probable that all types of osteoderms were distributed in two rows {{along the back of}} the animal, a <b>marked</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the better-known North American Stegosaurus, which had one row of plates on the neck, trunk and tail, and two rows of spikes on the tail tip. There is one type of spike that differs from all others in being strongly, and not only slightly, asymmetrical, and having a very broad base. Because of bone morphology classic reconstructions placed it on the hips, at the iliac blade, while many recent reconstructions place it on the shoulder, because a similarly shaped spike is known to have existed on the shoulder in the Chinese stegosaurs Gigantspinosaurus and Huayangosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} dinosaur {{research}} {{has enjoyed a}} surge in activity {{that began in the}} 1970s and is ongoing. This was triggered, in part, by John Ostrom's discovery of Deinonychus, an active predator that may have been warm-blooded, in <b>marked</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the then-prevailing image of dinosaurs as sluggish and cold-blooded. Vertebrate paleontology has become a global science. Major new dinosaur discoveries have been made by paleontologists working in previously unexploited regions, including India, South America, Madagascar, Antarctica, and most significantly China (the amazingly well-preserved feathered dinosaurs in China have further consolidated the link between dinosaurs and their living descendants, modern birds). The widespread application of cladistics, which rigorously analyzes the relationships between biological organisms, has also proved tremendously useful in classifying dinosaurs. Cladistic analysis, among other modern techniques, helps to compensate for an often incomplete and fragmentary fossil record.|$|E
40|$|NMR imaging {{of liver}} using Gd(III) -phytate complex as {{contrast}} agent was evaluated in rats. The 31 P NMR spectrum of Gd(III) -phytate complex is presented and discussed {{as well as}} the spin-lattice relaxation times. Rat liver images obtained at 10, 15, and 20 min after i. v. injection of Gd(III) -phytate (10 mg/kg) showed <b>marked</b> <b>contrast</b> enhancement attributable <b>to</b> the Gd(III) complex...|$|R

Dick Holler's other big writing success, a notably <b>marked</b> <b>contrast</b> of styles <b>to</b> [...] "Snoopy vs. the Red Baron", was the tribute song [...] "Abraham, Martin & John", a 1968 hit for Dion.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the end of}} the First World War, {{aircraft}} {{types in}} British military service have generally been known by a name (e.g. [...] "Spitfire"), with individual variants recognised by <b>mark</b> numbers, in <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the systems such as that used in the United States, where an aircraft type is primarily identified by an alphanumeric designation.|$|R

25|$|With a {{decimated}} roster, the Jets finished dead last in {{the league}} {{for the next two}} seasons, including a horrendous nine-win season in 1980–81 that still ranks as the worst in Jets/Coyotes history. This stands in <b>marked</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the other 1979 Avco Cup finalist, the Oilers, who {{became one of the most}} successful teams during the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|From {{the outset}} Connect aimed for {{supplying}} high end Internet {{services to the}} corporate and wholesale market, <b>marking</b> a stark <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the many small ISPs which {{grew out of the}} PSTN Bulletin Board systems or the APANA nodes.In addition to the comprehensive commercial services, Connect also supplied some additional services to both the Australian and International communities.|$|R
500|$|The {{story has}} none of the magic realist {{elements}} Hernandez used in the Palomar stories he is best known for. [...] The straightforward chronology and easily distinguished characters <b>marked</b> a <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> those of the complicated Poison River. [...] It nevertheless shares with Poison River a density that requires a relatively slow reading to follow. [...] It is condensed to quick, minimal scenes with expository dialog. [...] The panel rather than the page is the compositional unit; each panel is of equal size, and depending on the publication the work appears in, Hernandez arranges the panels in six- or nine-panel grids.|$|R
50|$|Shame of Gaeta ('Schande von Gaeta') was {{the name}} given by the Nazi {{propaganda}} to the outcome of an extraterritorial vote during the referendum on the German annexation of Austria (Anschluss) in 1938. In historical literature, the expression is sometimes used with quotation <b>marks.</b> In stark <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the overall result, the unhindered vote lead to a strong rejection of the Anschluss.|$|R

Melatonin Magik was released on February 09, 2010, to relatively positive reviews, being regarded as one of his most focused efforts yet. The album included several guest appearances (DZK~PR~ & Warbux), a <b>marked</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> many of his previous albums in which he kept features at a minimum.|$|E
25|$|In <b>marked</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> his ICC Trophy form, {{the runs}} flowed freely from Botha's bat during Ireland's {{conquest of the}} 2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup. A tournament average of 66.00 {{encompassed}} an international career-best 97 against the Netherlands at Stormont, and knocks of 78 and 43* in the final victory over Kenya at Windhoek. Botha also accounted for eight wickets at 25.50 with his medium-paced bowling {{during the course of}} the tournament.|$|E
40|$|Savant {{syndrome}} is a rare, but extraordinary, {{condition in which}} persons with serious mental disabilities, including autistic disorder, have some ‘island of genius’ which stands in <b>marked,</b> incongruous <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> overall handicap. As many as one in 10 persons with autistic disorder have such remarkable abilities in varying degrees, although savant syndrome occurs in other developmental disabilities or in other types of central nervous system injury or disease as well. Whatever the particular savant skill, it is always linked to massive memory. This paper presents {{a brief review of}} the phenomenology of savant skills, the history of the concept and implications for education and future research...|$|R
60|$|Blaisdell struck Jean {{as being}} a lionlike type of Texan, both in his broad, bold face, his huge head with its {{upstanding}} tawny hair like a mane, and in the speech and force that betokened {{the nature of his}} heart. He was not as old as Jean's father. He had a rolling voice, with the same drawling intonation characteristic of all Texans, and blue eyes that still held the fire of youth. Quite a <b>marked</b> <b>contrast</b> he presented <b>to</b> the lean, rangy, hard-jawed, intent-eyed men Jean had begun to accept as Texans.|$|R
50|$|However Stanley {{had been}} preempted by Peel. Three days earlier on 8 December 1834 Peel had issued an {{election}} address to his constituents (which was later dubbed the Tamworth Manifesto) which covered {{much of the}} same political and religious ground as Stanley's speech. Now usually known as a founding political ideology for what was to become the Conservative Party - it too said that Peel's party would support reform to correct 'abuses' where necessary and <b>marked</b> a <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the old Toryism that had gone before that appeared to be opposed to all change. It also meant that in practice the 'Derby Dilly' with their 'Knowsley Creed' and the Conservatives 'Tamworth Manifesto' were {{two sides of the same}} coin.|$|R
