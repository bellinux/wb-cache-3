5|$|All the {{interesting}} cases of homotopy groups of spheres involve <b>mappings</b> from a higher-dimensional sphere {{onto one of}} lower dimension. Unfortunately, the only example which can easily be visualized is not interesting: there are no nontrivial <b>mappings</b> from the ordinary sphere to the circle. Hence, π2(S1) = 0. This is because S1 has the real line as its universal cover which is contractible (it has the homotopy type of a point). In addition, because S2 is simply connected, by the lifting criterion, any map from S2 to S1 can be lifted to a map into the real line and the nullhomotopy descends to the downstairs space.|$|E

40|$|THIS DISSERTATION ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM OF <b>MAPPING</b> ALGORITHMS ONTO PROCESSOR ARRAYS AND NEW METHODS ARE DEVELOPED. THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUES CAN BE APPLIED TOALGORITHMS EXPRESSED IN THE FORM OF NESTED LOOPS. ALGORITHMS CHARACTERIZED BY CONSTANT DEPENDENCIES ARE STUDIED FIRST AND A METHODOLOGY BASED ON THE EXISTENCE OF INDEPENDENT GROUPS OF VARIABLES IN THE INDEX SPACE, IS PROPOSED. THE <b>MAPPING</b> OF THE DEPENDENCE GRAPH (DG) OF EACH GROUP IS ACCOMPLISHED, AFTER APPLICATION OF ORTHONORMALIZATION, BY USING A LINEAR TRANSFORM. THE NOTION OFTHE AUGMENTED DG (ADG) IS INTRODUCED FOR THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN VARIABLES WITH IDENTICAL INDICES IN A MULTIPLE STATEMENT LOOP. THE DESIGN OF FIXED-SIZE PROCESSOR ARRAYS IS ACHIEVED BY THE USE OF QUASI-LINEAR FUNCTIONS FOR THE ALLOCATION AND THE TIMING OF THE OPERATIONS WITHIN THE ARRAY. FINALLY, ALGORITHMS WITH NON-CONSTANT DEPENDENCIES ARE HANDLED AND THE CONCEPT OF SPACE-TIME REPRESENTATION IS INTRODUCED. FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE EVALUATION TIME OF EACH VARIABLE IS USED AS A COORDINATE IN THE DG AND THUS A SPACE-TIME DG (STDG) IS CONSTRUCTED. THE <b>MAPPING</b> OF THE STDG ONTO THE PROCESSOR ARRAY ARCHITECTURE IS ACHIEVED BY A LINEAR TRANSFORM. THIS METHOD AVOIDS THE NEED FOR FULLY INDEXING OF THE VARIABLES AND GUARANTEES THE EXISTENCE OF A LINEAR TRANSFORM SINCE OPPOSITE DEPENDENCE VECTORS DO NOT EXIST. ARRAYS DESIGNED USING THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUES EXHIBIT REDUCED COMPLEXITY OF THE PROCESSING ELEMENTSAND THE INTERCONNECTIONS AND REQUIRE LESS TIME FOR THE EXECUTION OF THE ALGORITHM. ...|$|R

The new maps, therefore, represent depictions of bedrock geology at the next level of detail. The map depicts a complex history of volcanism, sedimentation, intrusion, multiple events of migmatization involving partial melting and melt dispersion, and several periods of deformation and metamorphism. It lies within the southern exposed extent of the Archean Superior Province. In northern Minnesota, the province is divided into three major tectonomagmatic terranes known as the Wabigoon, Quetico, and Wawa subprovinces.
