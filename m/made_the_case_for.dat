25|$|As {{a junior}} {{particle}} physicist, Guth developed {{the idea of}} cosmic inflation in 1979 at Cornell and gave his first seminar on the subject in January 1980. Moving on to Stanford University Guth formally proposed the idea of cosmic inflation in 1981, {{the idea that the}} nascent universe passed through a phase of exponential expansion that was driven by a positive vacuum energy density (negative vacuum pressure). The results of the WMAP mission in 2006 <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> cosmic inflation very compelling.|$|E

Riddles took up the challenge, initially designing a 2-8-2 locomotive, but settled upon the 2-10-0 wheel arrangement for the increased traction and lower axle load that five coupled axles can provide.

25|$|The {{ignition}} {{point for the}} definition of modernism as a movement was the austere rejection of popular culture as kitsch by important post-war artists and taste-makers, most notably Clement Greenberg with his essay Avant-Garde and Kitsch, first published in Partisan Review in 1939. During the 1940s and 1950s Greenberg {{proved to be an}} articulate and powerful art critic. In particular his writing on American Abstract expressionism, and 20th-century European modernism persuasively <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> High art and culture. In 1961 Art and Culture, Beacon Press, a highly influential collection of essays by Clement Greenberg was first published. Greenberg is primarily thought of as a formalist art critic and many of his most important essays are crucial to the understanding of Modern art history, and the history of modernism and Late Modernism.|$|E
25|$|Macmillan {{placed the}} Nassau Agreement before Cabinet on 3 January 1963. He <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> Britain {{retaining}} nuclear weapons. He asserted {{that it would}} not be in the best interest of the Western Alliance for all knowledge of the technology to reside with the United States; that possession of an independent nuclear capability gave Britain the ability to respond to threats from the Soviet Union even when the United States was not inclined to support Britain; and that possession of nuclear weapons gave Britain a voice in nuclear disarmament talks. However, concerns were expressed that the dependence on the United States would necessarily diminish Britain's influence on world affairs. Thorneycroft addressed the view that Britain should provide a nuclear deterrent from its own resources. He pointed out that Polaris represented $800 million in research and development costs that the United Kingdom would save. Nonetheless, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Selwyn Lloyd, was still concerned at the cost.|$|E
25|$|Fremantle became second-in-command of the Third Battle Squadron in 1915, {{followed}} by {{commander of the}} Ninth Cruiser Squadron in 1916, and the Second Cruiser Squadron in early 1917. He was appointed to command the British Aegean Squadron in August 1917, and in December advocated the resumption of raids on the Turkish coast, a proposal rejected by the Admiralty {{on the grounds that}} no significant benefits were anticipated. In January the following year, Fremantle received a promotion to vice-admiral, and an appointment as Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff. As the war drew to a close, Fremantle was one of the officers advocated the surrender of the German High Seas Fleet as a condition for an armistice. In October 1918, he <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> the Royal Navy, stating that the naval disarmament of Germany was necessary, lest they be tempted into a 'recommencement of warlike operations'. Fremantle's proposals did not find favour with the American planners, who were keen to limit British naval domination.|$|E

25|$|Among La Luz’s {{most recent}} {{achievements}} is the restoration in May 17, 2011 of public worker rights in Puerto Rico after Puerto Rico Law 45 was nullified by {{the passage of}} a new fiscal austerity Law 7 by the current Governor of Puerto Rico Luis Fortuño- a Republican- amidst one of the worst fiscal and economic recessions that Puerto Rico has endured. Law 7 effectively suspended collective agreement clauses in an effort to repress public employees and strip them of collective bargaining rights. Law 7 also caused massive layoffs in Puerto Rico of over 19,000 public sector employees and aggravated an already dismal economic unemployment rate that affected thousands of working families struggling to make ends meet. La Luz was fundamental in speaking out against the injustices by insisting on the need to restore bargaining rights for public workers. In his impassioned speech at the Labor Day celebration sponsored by the President of the PR Senate, La Luz <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> restoration as he once again led a grassroots lobbying campaign along with other union leaders and the Senate President which resulted in the passage of Law 73 that restored the contracts that had been originally suspended by Law 7.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, on a {{visit to}} New York City, he was struck by the {{apparent}} paradox that the poor in that long-established city were much worse off than the poor in less developed California. These observations supplied the theme and title for his 1879 book Progress and Poverty, which was a great success, selling over 3 million copies. In it George made the argument that a sizeable portion of the wealth created by social and technological advances in a free market economy is possessed by land owners and monopolists via economic rents, and that this concentration of unearned wealth is the main cause of poverty. George considered it a great injustice that private profit was being earned from restricting access to natural resources while productive activity was burdened with heavy taxes, and indicated that such a system was equivalent to slavery – a concept somewhat similar to wage slavery. This is also the work in which he <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> a land value tax in which governments would tax the value of the land itself, thus preventing private interests from profiting upon its mere possession, but allowing the value of all improvements made to that land to remain with investors.|$|E

500|$|In January 1879 Sir John A. Macdonald, Prime Minister of {{what was}} now Post-Confederation Canada, {{commissioned}} politician Nicholas Flood Davin to write a report regarding the industrial boarding-school system in the United States. Now known as the Davin Report, the Report on Industrial Schools for Indians and Half-Breeds was submitted to Ottawa in March 14, 1879, and <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> a cooperative approach between the Canadian government and the church to implement the [...] "aggressive assimilation" [...] pursued by President of the United States, Ulysses S. Grant. Davin's report relied heavily on findings he acquired through consultations with government officials {{and representatives of the}} Five Civilized Tribes in Washington, D.C. and church officials in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He visited only one industrial day school, in Minnesota, before submitting his findings. In his report Davin concluded {{that the best way to}} civilize Indigenous peoples was to start with children in a residential setting, away from their families, so that they could be [...] "kept constantly within the circle of civilized [...] conditions".|$|E

[...] In addition to the unexpected artistic caliber, there were other reasons that <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> a theatrical release more compelling. [...] The economics of a direct-to-video Pixar release were not working as well as hoped thanks to the higher salaries of the crew. [...] After negotiations, Jobs and Roth agreed that the split of costs and profits for Toy Story 2 would follow the model of a newly created five-film deal—but Toy Story 2 would not count as one of the five films. Disney had bargained in the contract for five original features, not sequels, thus assuring five sets of new characters for its theme parks and merchandise.

Taylor compared the book to Dudley Stamp's Man and the Land, published {{a few months earlier}} in 1955, saying that Hoskins seemed to have missed it, but that given the differences in their approaches, they could be read side by side. She noted also that Hoskins did not talk about London though he covered town landscapes, and appeared unaware of urban geography. Her review ended by remarking that Hoskins [...] "views the industrial revolution with mounting horror, and the industrialists themselves are bitterly chastised as 'completely and grotesquely insensitive. No scruples weakened their lust for money; they made their money and left their muck.'" [...] She noted however that Hoskins had happily moved to [...] "a quiet spot in Oxfordshire where he can forget the 'barbaric England of the scientists, the military men and the politicians' and look out of his study window on to the past", where, she wrote, he [...] "draws for us a last tender and evocative picture of the 'gentle unravished English landscape.'"
