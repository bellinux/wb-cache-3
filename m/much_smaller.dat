40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} {{a low profile}} {{pentagonal}} microstrip patch antenna has been proposed, {{we have seen the}} response of truncated pentagonal patch antenna designed at resonant frequency 2. 42 GHz.

This type of antenna is aggressive miniaturized to meet requirements of the wireless communication system.
