In this study, we investigate the influence of {{extracellular matrix}} topography on the coordination of multi-cellular interactions in the context of angiogenesis. To do this, we validate our spatio-temporal mathematical model of angiogenesis against empirical data, and within this framework, we vary the density of the matrix fibers to simulate different tissue environments and to explore the possibility of manipulating the extracellular matrix to achieve pro- and anti-angiogenic effects. The model predicts specific ranges of <b>matrix</b> <b>fiber</b> densities that maximize sprout extension speed, induce branching, or interrupt normal angiogenesis, which are independently confirmed by experiment.

40|$|Mitral valve {{degeneration}} is a {{key component}} of the pathophysiology of Marfan syndrome. The biomechanical consequences of aging and genetic mutation in mitral valves are poorly understood because of limited tools to study this in mouse models. Our aim was to determine the global biomechanical and local cell-matrix deformation relationships in the aging and Marfan related Fbn 1 mutated murine mitral valve. To conduct this investigation, a novel stretching apparatus and gripping method was implemented to directly quantify both global tissue biomechanics and local cellular deformation and <b>matrix</b> <b>fiber</b> realignment in murine mitral valves. Excised mitral valve leaflets from wild-type and Fbn 1 mutant mice from 2 weeks to 10 months in age were tested in circumferential orientation under continuous laser optical imaging. Mouse mitral valves stiffen with age, correlating with increases in collagen fraction and <b>matrix</b> <b>fiber</b> alignment. Fbn 1 mutation resulted in significantly more compliant valves (modulus 1. 34 ± 0. 12 vs. 2. 51 ± 0. 31 MPa, respectively, P<. 01) at 4 months, corresponding with an increase in proportion of GAGs and decrease in elastin fraction. Local cellular deformation and fiber alignment change linearly with global tissue stretch, and these slopes become more extreme with aging. In comparison, Fbn 1 mutated valves have decoupled cellular deformation and fiber alignment with tissue stretch. Taken together, quantitative understanding of multi-scale murine planar tissue biomechanics is essential for establishing consequences of aging and genetic mutations. Decoupling of local cell-matrix deformation kinematics with global tissue stretch may be an important mechanism of normal and pathological biomechanical remodeling in valves...|$|E

40|$|This {{manuscript}} investigates compression after impact {{failure in}} woven fiber-reinforced composites. Compression failure of composite structures previously damaged by an impact event {{is due to}} the propagation of impact-induced damage mechanisms such as interlaminar debonding, constituent (i. e., <b>matrix</b> and <b>fiber)</b> microcracking, sublaminate buckling, as well as the interactions between these mechanisms. The failure mechanisms within each ply are idealized based on a reduced order multiscale computational model, in which, the damage prop-agation in the <b>matrix</b> and <b>fibers</b> upon compression is explicitly modeled. Delamination along the ply interfaces is idealized using a cohesive surface model. The initial impact-induced dam-age within the microconstituents and interfaces are inferred from experimental observations. A suite of numerical simulations is conducted to understand the sublaminate buckling, prop-agation of delamination and constituent damage upon compression loading. The numerical investigations suggest extensive propagation of delamination with mode transition preceding sublaminate buckling. Initiation and propagation of <b>matrix</b> and <b>fiber</b> cracking, observed upon sublaminate buckling, is the cause of ultimate shear failure...|$|R

In animal models of cancer, confocal imaging using multiphoton excitation provides reduced photobleaching, deeper imaging into thick specimens, and observation of some extracellular <b>matrix</b> <b>fibers.</b> Individual cells expressing fluorescent proteins such as GFP {{can be observed in}} order to evaluate the mechanisms of tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Tumor cells in vivo can show orientation towards blood vessels, and rapid movement along extracellular <b>matrix</b> <b>fibers.</b> To directly measure tumor cell invasion in the primary tumor in response to imposed gradient of growth factors, needles containing EGF or CSF- 1 have been found to stimulate invasion into the needle. Transgenic models of breast cancer which have lost expression of CSF- 1 show reduced invasiveness and metastasis. These results indicate that tumor cells can collaborate with macrophages during invasion. Such paracrine interactions between epithelial cells and macrophages likely reflect interactions that occur during ductal outgrowth in normal mammary gland development. The combination of in vivo imaging with genetic manipulation of xenograft and transgenic models of breast cancer will enable direct examination of mechanisms of invasion and metastasis.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} constitutive {{models for}} the anisotropic, finite-deformation viscoelastic behavior of soft fiber-reinforced composites. An essential assumption of the models is that both the <b>fiber</b> reinforcements and <b>matrix</b> can exhibit distinct time-dependent behavior. As such, the constitutive formulation attributes a different viscous stretch measure and free energy density to the <b>matrix</b> and <b>fiber</b> phases. Separate flow rules are specified for the matrix and the individual fiber families. The flow rules for the fiber families then are combined to give an anisotropic flow rule for the fiber phase. This {{is in contrast to}} many current inelastic models for soft fiber-reinforced composites which specify evolution equations directly at the composite level. The approach presented here allows key model parameters of the composite {{to be related to the}} properties of the <b>matrix</b> and <b>fiber</b> constituents and to the fiber arrangement. An efficient algorithm is developed for the implementation of the constitutive models in a finite-element framework, and examples are presented examining the effects of the viscoelastic behavior of the <b>matrix</b> and <b>fiber</b> phases on the time-dependent response of the composite...|$|R
