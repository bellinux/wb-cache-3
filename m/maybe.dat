5|$|A {{new video}} review slot was also {{introduced}} hosted by Ball called Hit, Miss Or <b>Maybe</b> in which three celebrities would review {{three of the}} latest pop videos and decide whether they {{thought they would be}} a hit, a miss or a <b>maybe.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Maybe</b> This Christmas Too? is {{a holiday}} {{compilation}} album released in October 2003 through Nettwerk Records featuring contemporary musicians performing both classic and original Christmas songs. The compilation {{served as a}} sequel to <b>Maybe</b> This Christmas (2002) and preceded <b>Maybe</b> This Christmas Tree (2004). A portion of the proceeds from the album went to Toys for Tots, a charity supported by the United States Marine Corps. Critical reception of the compilation, which failed to chart in any nation, was mixed.|$|E

5|$|<b>Maybe</b> mid-year; {{safe to say}} {{towards the}} end {{but not at the}} end, <b>maybe</b> like eight months or {{something}} like that. Best thing about it is we’re going to do it whenever we want to do it. There is no deadline right now, we don’t have any dates set, we don’t have the studio, we’re going to do the record ourselves. So we will literally go in and record it and it will be probably be done before we sign a contract.|$|E
5|$|On 26 February 2014, Noel via the band's {{official}} website {{announced that the}} first three studio albums would be reissued, remastered and re-released throughout the remainder of 2014 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Definitely <b>Maybe.</b> A remastered 3-disc version of Definitely <b>Maybe</b> was released on 19 May 2014.|$|E
5|$|And by {{the time}} they got it all {{organized}} and figured out, there were really only a couple of songs left for me to do anything on. So I came into L.A. for a couple of days and Kasim... came in, as was the routine, and we did <b>maybe</b> three songs... just so that I’d have a few fingerprints on the record. I think someone, <b>maybe</b> Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E
5|$|As {{it turned}} out, <b>maybe</b> Hadl {{had led him}} {{to believe that we}} had come down to reach some sort of {{monetary}} settlement with him. And it was really funny because it was not what he was expecting and his reaction was shock.|$|E
5|$|Gallagher {{has said}} that he used only 100-watt Marshalls early in his career. After Definitely <b>Maybe,</b> he began using smaller amps, {{singling}} out Fenders (Princeton and Bandmaster), and also a combo made by Clark Amplification, which builds amplifiers based on vintage Fender and Marshall amps.|$|E
5|$|I {{think that}} the band went on... <b>maybe</b> not a tangent, {{but we had a}} goal in mind, {{and at the end of}} the {{recording}} process, we were so proud of how artistic we were. And I think we showed too much. I think <b>maybe</b> we were a little too jaded and a little too dark, and I {{think that the}} lack of hope and faith that we put on this record made us a little less sparkly and light to people. But I think that it's all part of our evolution. We all went a bit too far.|$|E
5|$|In August 1970, Les Solomon, {{his wife}} and {{daughter}} were on vacation in the southwest and arranged to visit Mims, Roberts and their families. At that time, Dan Meyer and Don Lancaster were among the most prolific authors in Popular Electronics. Meyer had built a million dollar a year business that sold kits of parts to build the project that he and Lancaster wrote about. Mims and Roberts wanted to do the same and quizzed Solomon on the kit business. Solomon gave them some statistics but said there was no way of knowing how many kits an article would sell, <b>maybe</b> a hundred, <b>maybe</b> a thousand.|$|E
5|$|In the 10th century AD, Byzantine era Adages, Suidas {{describes}} an insect resembling a slow-moving green locust with long front legs. He translates Zenobius 2.94 {{with the words}} seriphos (<b>maybe</b> a mantis) and graus, an old woman, implying a thin, dried-up stick of a body.|$|E
5|$|Because of the immigrants’ {{loneliness}} {{for their}} homeland, Addams started hosting ethnic evenings at Hull House. This would include ethnic food, dancing, music, and <b>maybe</b> a short lecture on {{a topic of}} interest. Some of the themed evenings were Italian, Greek, German, Polish, etc. Ellen Gates Starr described one Italian evening as having the room packed full with people. One of the ladies who attended “recited a patriotic poem with great spirit” and everyone was moved by it.|$|E
5|$|Everything goes {{as planned}} until Caesar finds the money gone. He realizes {{that if he}} runs, Gino will think he took the money. He decides {{he has to get}} the money back from Johnnie. Panicking, Violet threatens to leave. Caesar pulls out his gun and forces her to stay, {{thinking}} that <b>maybe</b> she and Johnnie have stolen the money and framed him.|$|E
5|$|I think it's {{something}} that is so unique about Rihanna whatever she's doing, whatever character she's playing, whatever side of herself she's showing, she's in it 1,000 percent... And I think the song and {{the theme of this}} song, she wanted to obviously show a softer side, a lighter side, one that's caught in <b>maybe</b> a tumultuous relationship... There's so much variety with her and it's been such a journey with her.|$|E
5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. <b>Maybe</b> they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or <b>maybe</b> not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E
5|$|It's a {{very passionate}} song. It's really, I think <b>maybe,</b> the most passionate {{one on the}} record. I mean, I'm really proud of it because that's really one that goes {{over-the-top}} {{in the sense that}} it's got images - it has religious imagery of resurrection, it's got images of fertility and rebirth, it has really very good sexual images, images of cars - which I always like.|$|E
5|$|No other metal is {{verified}} {{to be more}} naturally diamagnetic than bismuth. (Superdiamagnetism is {{a different}} physical phenomenon.) Of any metal, it {{has one of the}} lowest values of thermal conductivity (after manganese, and <b>maybe</b> neptunium and plutonium) and the highest Hall coefficient. It has a high electrical resistivity. When deposited in sufficiently thin layers on a substrate, bismuth is a semiconductor, despite being a post-transition metal.|$|E
5|$|No, if we {{make this}} screen machine that you are asking for, it will spoil everything. We are making these peep show {{machines}} and selling {{a lot of them}} at a good profit. If we put out a screen machine there will be a use for <b>maybe</b> about ten of them in the whole United States. With that many screen machines you could show the pictures to everybody in the country—and then it would be done. Let's not kill the goose that lays the golden egg.|$|E
5|$|Now, you can win. You {{will not}} be a favorite; you'll be rather a long shot. But given luck and money and {{a hell of a lot}} of work, you can win... but for Christ's sake don't commit suicide with no dough... <b>Maybe</b> you can't crucify mankind on a cross of gold, but you can sure as hell crucify a statewide {{candidate}} upon a cross of no-gold.|$|E
5|$|The Fat Man {{plutonium}} bombs used explosive {{compression of}} plutonium to obtain significantly higher densities than normal, {{combined with a}} central neutron source to begin the reaction and increase efficiency. Thus only 6.2kg of plutonium was needed for an explosive yield equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT. Hypothetically, as little as 4kg of plutonium—and <b>maybe</b> even less—could {{be used to make}} a single atomic bomb using very sophisticated assembly designs.|$|E
5|$|When {{she became}} a mother in 1999, Thompson made a {{conscious}} decision to reduce her workload, and in the following years many of her appearances were supporting roles. She was not seen on screen again until 2000, with only a small part in the British comedy <b>Maybe</b> Baby, which she appeared in as a favour to its director, her friend Ben Elton.|$|E
5|$|You {{supported}} a stimulus package in 2009. In fact, {{you said the}} Obama stimulus package was not big enough. As governor, you signed onto a regional cap-and-trade market. You endorsed civil unions for same-sex couples. And you served as President Obama's ambassador to China. Some people have suggested that <b>maybe</b> you're running for president in the wrong party.|$|E
5|$|Petit {{jury and}} venue provisionsboth {{traceable}} to enumerated complaints in the Declaration of Independenceare included in Article Three of the United States Constitution. More criminal procedure provisions {{are contained in}} the United States Bill of Rights, specifically the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments. With {{the exception of the}} Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment, and (<b>maybe)</b> the Excessive Bail Clause of the Eighth Amendment, all of the criminal procedure provisions of the Bill of Rights have been incorporated to apply to the state governments.|$|E
5|$|The {{due process}} clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments apply {{generally}} to {{all stages of}} criminal proceedings. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was the vehicle for the incorporation {{of all of the}} foregoing rights (with the exception of the Grand Jury Clause, the Vicinage Clause, and <b>maybe</b> the Excessive Bail Clause) to apply in state criminal proceedings. Due process is also the catchall vehicle for the enforcement of fundamental fairness, even if the infirmities of a given prosecution do not neatly sound in another enumerated provision.|$|E

DNA found on the robot is traced back to Ambrose, since <b>Maybe</b> had swapped his own DNA for Ambrose's in Justice Department's records when he stole Ambrose's identity. <b>Maybe</b> is arrested and interrogated by Beeny. However his true identity is exposed when Dredd obtains an old sample of Maybe's DNA from an archived evidence file and sends it for forensic analysis. When it matches Ambrose's DNA record, <b>Maybe</b> confesses.|$|E
25|$|As {{this student}} fell behind the car, I saw another student go down, {{next to the}} curb, {{on the far side}} of the automobile, <b>maybe</b> 25 or 30 yards from where I was lying. It was <b>maybe</b> 25, 30, 35 seconds of {{sporadic}} firing.|$|E
