500|$|The <b>maintenance</b> <b>dose</b> of {{warfarin}} can fluctuate significantly {{depending on}} the amount of vitamin K1 in the diet. Keeping vitamin K1 intake at a stable level can prevent these fluctuations. Leafy green vegetables tend to contain higher amounts of vitamin K1. Green parts of members of the family Apiaceae, such as parsley, cilantro, and dill, are extremely rich sources of vitamin K; cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage and broccoli, as well as the darker varieties of lettuces and other leafy greens, are also relatively high in vitamin K1. Green vegetables such a peas and green beans do not have such high amounts of vitamin K1 as leafy greens. Certain vegetable oils have high amounts of vitamin K1. [...] Foods low in vitamin K1 include roots, bulbs, tubers, and most fruits and fruit juices. Cereals, grains and other milled products are also low in vitamin K1.|$|E
40|$|Asthma {{guidelines}} {{suggest a}} stepwise approach to maintenance pharmacological treatment of persistent asthma until control is attained, and a 3 month {{review of the}} fixed <b>maintenance</b> <b>dosing</b> for step-up or step-down adjustment. This 12 -week study compared the efficacy and safety of budesonide/formoterol in a single inhaler (Symbicort Turbuhaler 160 / 4. 5 or 80 / 4. 5 microg) given as adjustable maintenance or fixed <b>maintenance</b> <b>dosing.</b> Patients (n = 2358) were randomised to budesonide/formoterol fixed <b>maintenance</b> <b>dosing</b> (two inhalations bid) or adjustable <b>maintenance</b> <b>dosing</b> (two inhalation bid; stepping up to four inhalations bid if asthma worsened for a maximum of 14 days; stepping down to two inhalations once nocte or one inhalation bid if symptoms were controlled) for 12 weeks, following a 4 -week run-in period on budesonide/formoterol two inhalations bid. Primary efficacy variables were frequency of asthma exacerbations and changes in patients' asthma symptom severity. Secondary variables were asthma control, safety and health economics. Both adjustable <b>maintenance</b> <b>dosing</b> and fixed <b>maintenance</b> <b>dosing</b> were associated with similar low frequency of exacerbations (5 % both groups; ns) and similarly improved lung function, with similarly fewer nocturnal awakenings and less asthma symptoms compared with the mean value of the run-in period. However, patients on adjustable <b>maintenance</b> <b>dosing</b> used 24 % fewer study drug compared with fixed <b>maintenance</b> <b>dosing</b> (2. 95 versus 3. 86 inhalations daily; p < 0. 0001) and incurred in a significant (p < 0. 0001) reduction in total costs (direct+indirect) compared with fixed <b>maintenance</b> <b>dosing.</b> In conclusion, adjustable <b>maintenance</b> <b>dosing</b> with budesonide/formoterol effectively controls asthma at a reduced drug load with lower costs than fixed <b>maintenance</b> <b>dosing...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Crotalidae Polyvalent Immune Fab (Ovine) {{has been}} the only {{antivenom}} commercially available in the US since 2007 for treatment of Crotalinae envenomation. Late coagulopathy can occur or recur after clearance of Fab antivenom, often after hospital discharge, lasting in some cases more than 2 weeks. There have been serious, even fatal, bleeding complications associated with recurrence phenomena. Frequent follow-up is required, and additional intervention or hospitalization is often necessary. F(ab') 2 immunoglobulin derivatives have longer plasma half life than do Fab. We hypothesized that F(ab') 2 antivenom would be superior to Fab in the prevention of late coagulopathy following treatment of patients with Crotalinae envenomation. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, double-blind, randomized clinical trial, comparing late coagulopathy in snakebitten patients treated with F(ab') 2 with <b>maintenance</b> <b>doses</b> [F(ab') 2 /F(ab') 2], or F(ab') 2 with placebo <b>maintenance</b> <b>doses</b> [F(ab') 2 /placebo], versus Fab with <b>maintenance</b> <b>doses</b> [Fab/Fab]. The primary efficacy endpoint was coagulopathy (platelet count < 150 K/mm(3), fibrinogen level < 150 mg/dL) between end of <b>maintenance</b> <b>dosing</b> and day 8. RESULTS: 121 patients were randomized at 18 clinical sites and received at least one dose of study drug. 114 completed the study. Of these, 11 / 37 (29. 7 %) in the Fab/Fab cohort experienced late coagulopathy versus 4 / 39 (10. 3 %, p < 0. 05) in the F(ab') 2 /F(ab') 2 cohort and 2 / 38 (5. 3 %, p < 0. 05) in the F(ab') 2 /placebo cohort. The lowest heterologous protein exposure was with F(ab') 2 /placebo. No serious adverse events were related to study drug. In each study arm, one patient experienced an acute serum reaction and one experienced serum sickness. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, management of coagulopathic Crotalinae envenomation with longer-half-life F(ab') 2 antivenom, with or without <b>maintenance</b> <b>dosing,</b> reduced the risk of subacute coagulopathy and bleeding following treatment of envenomation...|$|R
30|$|Conclusion: Standard enoxaparin dosing regimens is not {{appropriate}} to reach the target in pediatric liver transplantation patients.

40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} costs and {{effectiveness}} of adjustable <b>maintenance</b> <b>dosing</b> with budesonide/formoterol in a single inhaler versus fixed dosing in adults with asthma. Methods: In this prospective, randomised, open-label, parallel-group, multicentre trial conducted in Germany, patients with asthma received budesonide/formoterol 160 mug/ 4. 5 mug in a single inhaler (Symbicort(R) Turbuhaler(R)) with two inhalations twice daily for a 4 -week run-in period. Patients were then randomised to either adjustable <b>maintenance</b> <b>dosing</b> (one inhalation twice daily, stepping up to four inhalations twice daily for 1 week if asthma worsened; n = 1679) or fixed dosing (two inhalations twice daily; n = 1618) for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was the change in health-related quality of life (HR-QOL), measured using the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (standardised) during the randomised treatment period. Resource utilisation data were collected in parallel and combined with German unit costs to estimate direct and indirect costs (year 2001 values). Results: Both treatment regimens were equally effective in maintaining HR-QOL and asthma control during the randomised treatment period. However, overall, patients in the adjustable <b>maintenance</b> <b>dosing</b> group took fewer daily inhalations of budesonide/formoterol {{than those in the}} fixed-dosing group (mean: 2. 63 vs 3. 82 inhalations; p = 80 % predicted normal and when total costs were considered. Conclusion: Adjustable <b>maintenance</b> <b>dosing</b> with budesonide/formoterol in a single inhaler maintained HR-QOL in adult patients with asthma at a significantly lower cost than fixed dosing.

40|$|Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are a {{heterogeneous}} group of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) {{is a common}} subtype of PTCL, and patients with AITL typically have a poor prognosis with limited treatment options. Clinical studies have demonstrated the activity of romidepsin, a structurally unique, potent, bicyclic class 1 selective histone deacetylase inhibitor, in patients with relapsed or refractory AITL. In the case presented herein, we describe a patient treated with single-agent romidepsin at first diagnosis of AITL, resulting in complete remission for over 2 years and leading {{to the use of}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>dosing.</b> The patient eventually underwent a successful autologous stem cell transplant.

40|$|Introduction. <b>Maintenance</b> <b>dosing</b> of neuromuscular {{blocking}} agents {{is complex}} and varies with patient, procedure, and clinical situation. With this in mind, we sought to identify factors impacting the <b>maintenance</b> <b>dosing</b> of neuromuscular blockers as a step toward identifying best practice with respect to minimizing residual neuromuscular blockade. Methods. Cases utilizing rocuronium from July 1, 2010, to June 30, 2014, at the sponsoring institution were analyzed. Using a mixed model to account for repeated measures, patients were analyzed by dose and weight category {{as defined by the}} World Health Organization (eight categories ranging from very severely underweight to very severely obese) {{as well as by the}} administering provider’s level of experience. Results. The study included 12, 671 patients with a mean age of 49. 7 (SD 16. 7). Increasing weight category and higher levels of provider experience were associated with higher doses for rocuronium. There were no differences in initial dose or in frequency of <b>maintenance</b> <b>dosing</b> by weight category after controlling for case length. Discussion. The two dosing patterns identified, higher doses for overweight patients and higher doses administered by experienced providers, are modifiable factors that could enhance patient safety...|$|R
40|$|Free vascularized fibular {{grafting}} (FVFG) {{has been}} reported to be an effective method of treating osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). This study evaluated whether postoperative <b>maintenance</b> <b>doses</b> of corticosteroids had an adverse effect on FVFG outcomes in patients with corticosteroid-induced ONFH. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 39 patients (67 hips) who had received <b>maintenance</b> <b>doses</b> of corticosteroids following FVFG. This group was matched to a group of patients who had not received corticosteroids treatment after operation. The mean follow-up duration was 5. 4 years for the postoperative corticosteroid administration group (PCA group) and 5. 0 years for the control group. At the latest follow-up, the average increase in Harris hip score was 11. 1 ± 8. 7 points for all hips in the PCA group and 12. 6 ± 7. 4 points for all hips in the control group (P> 0. 05). In the PCA group, through radiographic evaluation, 49 hips were improved, 10 hips appeared unchanged, and 8 hips appeared worse.
