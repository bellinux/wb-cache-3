25|$|The Viperidae differ much among {{themselves}} in the toxicity of their venom. Some, such as the Indian Russell's viper (Daboia russelli) and saw-scaled viper (Echis carinatus); the American rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.), bushmasters (Lachesis spp.) and lanceheads (Bothrops spp.); and the African adders (Bitis spp.), night adders (Causus spp.), and horned vipers (Cerastes spp.), cause fatal results unless a remedy is speedily applied. The bite of the larger European vipers may be very dangerous, and followed by fatal results, especially in children, {{at least in the}} hotter parts of the Continent; whilst the small <b>meadow</b> <b>viper</b> (Vipera ursinii), which hardly ever bites unless roughly handled, {{does not seem to be}} possessed of a very virulent venom, and, although very common in some parts of Austria and Hungary, is not known to have ever caused a serious accident.|$|E
25|$|The firm land of {{the delta}} used to be covered with large groves of willow trees, which have been cut down almost entirely and {{replaced}} with Canadian poplars. On the river banks kept in their natural state, small groves of willow trees (Salix alba, Salix fragilis, Salix purpurea, Salix petandra, Salix triandra etc.) can still be found, mixed with white poplar (Populus alba). Occasionally, the willow trees form corridors along the arms and bigger channels of the Danube. On the levees of Letea and Caraorman, mixed forests of oak (Quercus robur, Quercus pedunculiflora) with various trees (Fraxinus pallisae, Ulmus foliacea, Populus tremula), shrubs (Prunus spinosa, Crataegus monogyna, Rosa canina, Berberis vulgaris etc.), and vines (Vitis sylvestris, Hedera helix, Humulus lupulus, Periploca graeca, which reaches up to 25m) grow on sand dune areas. On the Letea levee, these exotic-looking forests grow especially in the depressions between the sand dunes, in small groves called hasmace.

40|$|Vipera berus (Linnaeus, 1758) is the {{terrestrial}} snake showing the widest {{distribution in the}} world, occuring from Great Britain, France and Northern Italy to the Sakhalin Island and North Korea (Nilson, 1980; Saint Girons, 1980; Nilson et al., 1994; Nilson & Andrén, 1997 a). However, adders do not occur uniformly over their distribution area, but are scattered in several isolated populations (Nilson & Andrén, 1997 a). Frequently, ecological traits of borderline and isolated populations differ from those living in the core area of the distribution range of the species, and might be subjected to higher risks of stochastic extinction and higher differentiation rates (Mayr, 1970).

40|$|<b>Meadow</b> <b>vipers</b> (Vipera ursinii) {{are small}} venomous snakes whose range in Hungary {{has been greatly}} {{fragmented}} by anthro-pogenic habitat disturbance (especially, agriculture). We obtained DNA from a total of eight Hungarian snakes. Genetic variability at the major histocompatibility (Mhc) class I loci was much lower for these snakes than for specimens from two large Ukrainian populations. Within two Hungarian populations for which we had multiple individuals, band-sharing indices were 100 and 84. 6 % (versus 63. 3 and 57 % for the Ukraine populations). The Ukrainian snakes also displayed more RFLP fragments than the Hun-garian vipers (mean 13. 7 versus 9. 0, respectively). In combination with reports of birth deformities, chromosomal abnormalities and low juvenile survival, these data strongly suggest that the Hungarian vipers are experiencing inbreeding depression. Genetic diver-sity is still present in the Hungarian vipers but among rather than within populations. Given the very low numbers of animals, the only feasible strategy to increase the genetic diversity and to save the Hungarian vipers from extinction is to implement a captiv...|$|R
40|$|During 2002, 2003 and 2005, {{we managed}} to examine 101 <b>meadow</b> <b>vipers</b> (Vipera ursinii) from two {{different}} populations in the Romanian Danube-Delta. We examined 42 animals from population near Sfântu-Gheorge and 59 individuals from Periteasca: 56 males (55. 5 %) and 45 females (44. 5 %). Fifteen of the observed were juvenile (14. 9 %), 16 of them were subadult (15. 8 %) and 70 were adult (69. 3 %). We recorded several morphometric data on every animal and we collected blood-samples from 48 adult individuals: 18 samples from Sfântu -Gheorge (10 males, 8 females) and 30 from Periteasca (14 males, 16 females), for genetic analysis using RAPD and microsatellite markers. We included 27 morphological characters, 68 polymorphic alleles (7 - 17 bands per primer) found with 14 decamer RAPD primers and 39 alleles found at 4 microsatellite loci (4 - 18 alleles per locus). The average similarity was 46 % based on morphological data, while 67 % based on RAPD results, with no significant differencesbetween the two populations. The average heterozigosity was 75 % in the Periteasca population and 68 % in the Sfântu- Gheorge population. PCA plots based on the RAPD band presence/absence binary matrix and on the microsatellite genotypic distances of the individuals differentiated the samples mainly according to their origin; however, plots of 27 morphological characters formed slightly mixed groups.

40|$|Many taxa {{are declining}} worldwide, {{and the cause}} of this decline has {{attracted}} massive concern (e. g. Caughley, 1994). One major contributor to endangerment has been habitat fragmentation, where a formerly wide-ranging taxon persists only as a series of small isolated populations (Knick and Rotenberry, 1995). Small isolated populations are not only more vulnerable to extinction through factors such as demographic and environmental stochasticity, but the loss of genetic variation may further increase the risk of extinction (e. g. Lande and Barrowclough, 1987; Madsen et al., 1999; Frankham et al., 2002). The Hungarian <b>meadow</b> <b>viper</b> (Vipera ursinii rakosiensis Méhely, 1893) {{is one of the most}} threatened snakes in Europe (e. g. Korsós, 1992; Ujvari et al., 2002). The former distribution of this taxon included the easternmost part of Austria, Hungary, Transylvania (Romania), and northern Bulgaria (Dely and Janisch, 1959). At present, however, small populations only exist in two regions of Hungary (in the Great Hungarian Plain between the rivers Danube and Tisza, and in the Hanság Nature Reserve, in north-western part of the country;Korsós, 1992). Since 1974 the <b>meadow</b> <b>viper</b> has received full legal protection in Hungary, with a present estimated nature conservation value of approximately 2000 EUR/specimen. Unfortunately, most of the few remaining wild populations are very small, fragmented and exhibit extremely low genetic diversity (Ujvari et al., 2002). In these population demographic and genetic factors have resulted in that the Hungarian <b>meadow</b> <b>viper</b> is suffering from severe inbreeding depression, resulting in chromosomal abnormalities, severe birth deformities, and low juvenile survival (Liptoi et al., 1999; Ujvari et al., 2000, 2002). The importance of maintaining large non-fragmented populations is further strengthened by the results from an Italian study where no such neonate abnormalities were documented from large, nonfragmented <b>meadow</b> <b>viper</b> populations (Filippi and Luiselli, 2004) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{first step}} towards the {{preservation}} of endangered species is to establish an appropriate ranking system, which assigns different nature conservation priority scores to different taxa. The system developed by Millsap et al. (Wildlife Monograph 1990, 111 : 1 – 57) has been modified and applied to the mammal, bird, reptile, and amphibian species of Hungary. Three variable groups have been compiled, including eight (measuring biological characteristics), three (features of the Hungarian population) and five (evaluation of research and conservation actions) variables, respectively. In cooperation with several experts, we gave scores to all 379 taxa considered. The most endangered taxon {{proved to be the}} Hungarian <b>Meadow</b> <b>Viper</b> (Vipera ursinii rakosiensis), which occurs only in Hungary with just a few hundred individ-uals. The species rank depends on the availability and quality of data, so it is urgent to devote more effort to survey and monitoring projects. We present a possible application of the species list, where the taxa are grouped according to their legal status in Hungary (strictly protected, protected, partly protected and not protected), and the validity of this categorisation was tested by applying multivariate discriminant analysis. Only 58. 36 % of the species were correctly classified. The reasons for stronger than expected protection include popularity, attractiveness, and local rarity, while reasons for lower protection include preference for hunting and control of predators and pests...|$|E
