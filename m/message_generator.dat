If it is greater than the center value, the user-silhouette is compared to the right child node. Therefore, the comparison of nodes continues until the correlation coefficient of the two silhouettes is over εPoseMatching or the terminal node is reached. The index of the node that is ultimately reached is also transmitted to the <b>message</b> <b>generator.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Publish / {{subscribe}} is {{a well-known}} mechanism that allows entities interested in certain information (i. e., the subscribers) to receive relevant messages from some <b>message</b> <b>generators</b> (i. e., the publishers). We argue that for networked or distributed virtual environment (VE) applications, a spatial publish / subscribe (SPS), where each entity can receive messages generated within a specified space in the VE, is a fundamental mechanism underlying various VE applications. It is therefore of importance for the VE community to understand the main characteristics and limitations of SPS.

30|$|The {{recognition}} stage converts {{the estimated}} pose into markup language, which is {{transmitted to the}} network as follows.

Background learner acquires backgrounds when the user is absent and then transfers the background image to the silhouette extractor. Subsequently, the silhouette extractor extracts the shapes of users from the received images by considering the background images and transmits them to the pose estimator. The pose estimator searches the pose decision tree and estimates the poses of the received images. The estimated poses are then transmitted to the network through the <b>message</b> <b>generator</b> and message sender (the former creates messages and the latter transmits them to other users).

30|$|Analyzing {{the stress}} testing results, we notice that Grizzly is a {{suitable}} application server for the hosting of the broker node, {{due to its}} robustness and ability to handle {{a very large number}} of simultaneous requests (up to 2000 requests/sec can be supported). Due to those capability, our broker was able to handle very high traffic loads, without crashing. In fact, the system was tested for up to 15, 000 publication requests (describing up to 120, 000 resources) without failure. As the number of publication request increased, the response time to process the requests increased in a quadratic fashion, while the network load increased in a logarithmic fashion, when two PIP nodes were used as <b>message</b> <b>generators.</b> However, this pattern changed to a cubic growth pattern (for both network load and response time) when four PIPs were used to generate publication requests simultaneously, thus doubling the number of requests generated and the number of resources published. This polynomial (cubic) increase in response time and network load is due to several factors such as database overhead caused by reading/writing records, resource description marshaling and un-marshaling, HTTP requests processing overhead, and increase in the number of requests exchanged.|$|R

3000|$|In our experiments, {{clients have}} been {{emulated}} {{by using the}} well-known SIPp traffic generator [39]. This choice {{is due to the}} unavailability of high performance IGMP <b>message</b> <b>generators.</b> Thus, by using SIPp, the client generates SIP messages with the IGMP report information already encoded in the payload, thus emulating the output of the ASN-GW towards the MBSC-SS. In turn, the WANE has been modified with respect to its base version, in order to simply forward the SIPp-generated messages to the MBSC-SS, without modifying them. By using this configuration, we have collected significant statistics, such as the number of lost SIP messages and the signaling latency, by using the built-in logging capabilities of the SIPp. In particular, we have measured the throughput and latency of the core component of our architecture, the MBSC-SS. We have checked that the WANE was never the system performance bottleneck in our testbed implementation. In addition, we have measured the average signaling protocol overhead of each message exchanged between the MBS entities, and compared it with a typical IMS-based system. In all service lifecycle phases, per-user and per-BS frequency overhead have been evaluated. Finally, we have evaluated the maximum number of users that our testbed can support while keeping a good QoS level in terms of signaling latency and service availability. In particular, we consider a maximum tolerable channel switching time of 100 ms and service availability equal to, at least, 99 %. As mentioned in Section 4.3, it is worth to remember that our focus is the performance of the IP part of the MBS signaling architecture, thus the WiMAX network may be simply regarded as a [...] "black box" [...] emulated by our WANE module.|$|R
30|$|Most of the {{problems}} regarding symmetric/asymmetric approaches can be remedied using double encryption. The advantages of the symmetric approaches are utilized to encrypt bulk of the data, while asymmetric approaches are used to provide authentication/verification to secure communication (as discussed in Sections 3.1. 1 and 3.1. 2 symmetric approaches are sometimes fail in authentication purposes). Using double encryption, a message (may be bulk data) can be encrypted by symmetric key approach, while the key is again encrypted by public/private keys of asymmetric approach. Once the message is encrypted by public key of recipients, {{it can only be}} decrypted by its private key. This ensures a safe communication between the source and the verified/authenticated recipient. On the other hand, if the message is encrypted by private key of the recipient, it can only be decrypted by corresponding public key (which is publicly available). This process authenticates the source of encryption and therefore prevents any possible repudiation or denial from the <b>message</b> <b>generator.</b>|$|E

The throughput and delay requirements for this newly emerging application area are quite different from the throughput and delay requirements for interactive use or file transfers.

Therefore we are currently studying the throughput limits for single-packet messages. We realize that up to now little attempt was made to optimize throughput for low delay traffic. It was nevertheless surprising for us to find out that the observed throughput for single-packet messages is in many cases only about one fourth of what one would expect.

40|$|Abstract — In {{the recent}} times {{it has been}} seen that {{wireless}} network is established {{with the help of}} nodes and used them as a monitoring system. But the problem arises that the traffic each node handles is of great extent. Also the security and efficiency in working in emergency situations is very low. It has a limitation over worldwide access everywhere due to non-standardized communication between multiple mobile service provider in the emergency conditions. Hence we are proposing a system for wireless modem control and statistics monitoring in such networks. In this the different nodes will be the intermediate between the user and the mobile service provider. So In this model a user will send its data through a <b>message</b> <b>generator</b> node which will further carried by data forwarder node and at last to the GSM node. A sleep scheduling algorithm is used for efficient energy consumption and avoiding congestion and collision of the messages. So this paper discusses about the technology used for fruitful, reliable and secured communication and monitoring in emergency ad hoc networks...|$|E
40|$|This Master thesis {{describes}} {{the development and}} the implementation of algorithms to generate traffic messages for the motorised traffic in urban areas. The developed algorithms {{have to work with}} strongly heterogeneous travel time information and generate from this, concise traffic messages. This applied research was accomplished at the Institute of Transport Research at the German Aerospace Centre (DLR). Since several years the researchers have worked with floating car data (FCD) and have researched the traffic situation in large cities. Taxis are used as floating cars, whereby at present approx. 5. 000 vehicles deliver data from six european and one asiatic city continuously. The technology of floating car data is described in principles. Emphasis is on the algorithms, which produce finally the traffic messages. Possible representational forms and formats are pointed out. The specified earning of information is not a component of this thesis and is only principle regarded. In the context of this master thesis two different message systems (<b>message</b> <b>generator,</b> TMC generator) were developed. The Message-Generator delivers messages in the plain text for broadcast. The TMC-Generator in opposite to it, delivers messages in TMC-XML format. These are transferred to a FTP-server and coded there into TMC format. The description of the TMC coding is not the subject of this thesis. However the XML format, from which the TMC messages were generated, is described. The structure of this thesis follows in far parts the temporal succession of the activities. Only the research of the existing conventional basics for the recognition and modelling of traffic conditions and the development of own ideas for detection of congestion ran parallel. At the beginning the traffic conditions are considered theoretically. Subsequently, classical ideas and forms of the pilot research are treated. Afterwards own algorithms and ideas for detection of congestion are described. These algorithms were implemented and represented in the complex system. A validation and evaluation of the developed algorithms is finishing this thesis. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{healthcare}} model {{currently being}} used in most countries will soon be inadequate, due to the increasing care costs of a growing population of elderly people, the rapid increase of chronic diseases, the growing demand for new treatments and technologies, and the relative {{decrease in the number}} of healthcare professionals with respect to the population increase. This healthcare model, which is centered on highly specialized people, located in large hospitals, needs to change into a distributed model, in order to produce faster responses and to allow patients to manage their own health. A distributed healthcare model that pervades the daily lives of the citizens is more appropriate to provide less expensive and more effective and timely healthcare, and characterizes Pervasive Healthcare. This thesis aims at demonstrating the feasibility of using healthcare standards, ubiquitous computing technologies, service-oriented architecture principles, and software agents, to develop interoperable applications for exchanging messages in Pervasive Healthcare environments. This thesis presents a Reusable Architecture and a <b>Message</b> <b>Generator</b> that employ these technologies for achieving its aim. In this work, a case study was performed in a realistic distributed healthcare environment, where three usage scenarios were defined in the cardiology domain: delivery of laboratory analysis results, schedule of an appointment for pacemaker evaluation, and support of a medical staff meeting to prepare for a cardiac surgery. The experiments were conducted in a distributed environment at the Santa Casa Hospital of Marília (Brazil). The evaluation of these applications was carried out using the Technology Acceptance Model, since this model is generally considered as appropriate to explain technology acceptance. We showed that the methodology proposed in this thesis truly facilitates the development of Pervasive Healthcare. The proposed methodology preserves the investment in the legacy healthcare information systems and allows developers to add new features to them, aiming to fill the automation gap and satisfying the need for increased user mobility, while providing smart assistance to the end-users. The results obtained so far are highly promising, and encourage us to continue exploring our methodology to develop communication services that are suitable for other healthcare scenarios...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} ways to {{calculate}} influence in social media. We use an approach that distinguishes between content generators and conversation generators. This allows us to distinguish between the generation of potentially passive content versus the generation of conversations that include content with “pass along ” appeal. The “pass along” content is potentially more influential since it exposes the content to more actors and embodies a social “referral” component which has been demonstrated to affect the information and behavioral impact of <b>messages.</b> Content <b>Generator</b> Metric. In its simplest form, this is the number of communications over a given time period. A social media user who posts comments to a huge follower community generates a large content influence score.

Social media users who drive conversations tend to generate a large number of file forwarding activities. They are mentioned a lot. They might also motivate a large number of replies and comments. Our original construction of metrics to operationalize these metrics used direct measures of tagged content in the social media source (in this case Twitter).

Methods: In a prospective randomized study, the surgeon blindly tested new and resterilised ultrasonic scissors. The parameters were force of activation, cutting effect, coagulation effect, error <b>messages</b> and disturbing <b>generator</b> noise. Results: 51 new and 49 resterilised instruments in 94 operations were evaluated. The differences in force of activation, cutting effect and coagulation were not significant.

The use of resterilised instruments leads to distinctly reduced costs and could contribute to efficiency in laparoscopic surgery...|$|R
40|$|Sensing and {{alerting}} {{are fundamental}} to AAL. It {{is a long}} way from sensing to alerting, where lots of messages are interchanged among different processing units. Starting from the transfer of sensed data to the data processor and all the way to the alert <b>generator,</b> <b>messages</b> change in format, type, and size when intended for different stakeholders. Along this way, it becomes important to decide which messages to transfer, how to transfer, and when to transfer, taking into account the dependability requirements for a reliable AAL system.

40|$|Recent {{statistics}} {{have demonstrated}} {{that two of the}} most important causes of failures of the UAVs (Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle) missions are related to the low level of decisional autonomy of vehicles and to the man machine interface. Therefore, a relevant issue is to design a display/controls architecture which allows the efficient interaction between the operator and the remote vehicle and to develop a level of automation which allows the vehicle the decision about change in mission. The research presented in this paper focuses on a modular man-machine interface simulator for the UAV control, which simulates UAV missions, developed to experiment solution to this problem. The main components of the simulator are an advanced interface and a block defined automation, which comprehend an algorithm that implements the level of automation of the system. The simulator has been designed and developed following a user-centred design approach in order {{to take into account the}} operator’s needs in the communication with the vehicle. The level of automation has been developed following the supervisory control theory which says that the human became a supervisor who sends high level commands, such as part of mission, target, constraints, in then-rule, while the vehicle receives, comprehends and translates such commands into detailed action such as routes or action on the control system. In order to allow the vehicle to calculate and recalculate the safe and efficient route, in term of distance, time and fuel a 3 D planning algorithm has been developed. It is based on considering UASs representative of real world systems as objects moving in a virtual environment (terrain, obstacles, and no fly zones) which replicates the airspace. Original obstacle avoidance strategies have been conceived in order to generate mission planes which are consistent with flight rules and with the vehicle performance constraints. The interface is based on a touch screen, used to send high level commands to the vehicle, and a 3 D Virtual Display which provides a stereoscopic and augmented visualization of the complex scenario in which the vehicle operates. Furthermore, it is provided with an audio feedback <b>message</b> <b>generator.</b> Simulation tests have been conducted with pilot trainers to evaluate the reliability of the algorithm and the effectiveness and efficiency of the interface in supporting the operator in the supervision of an UAV mission.

40|$|Problem statement: A block ciphers {{provides}} confidentiality in cryptography but cryptanalysis of {{the classical}} block ciphers demonstrated some old weaknesses grabbing a partial key in any stage of encryption procedure leads to reconstructing the whole key. Exhaustive key search shows that key generation should be indeterminist and random for each round. Matching cipher-text attack shows that larger size of block is more secure. In order to overcome analysis mentioned above a new algorithm is designed {{that is based on}} random numbers and also can defeat time and memory constraints. Approach: Dynamic and <b>message</b> dependent key <b>generator</b> was created by producing a random number and it was selected as the size of first chunk. Residual value of second chunk divided by first chunk concatenating with first chunk forms the first cipher as an input for SP-boxes. These processes repeated until whole mesaage get involved into the last cipher. Encrypted messages are not equal under different run. Value of random number should be greater than 35 bits and plaintext must be at least 7 bits. A padding algorithm was used for small size messages or big random numbers. Results: Attack on the key generation process was prevented because of random key generation and its dependency to input message. Encryption and decryption times measured between 5 and 27 m sec in 2 GHz Pentium and java platform so time variant and fast enough key generation had been kept collision and timing attacks away due to small seized storage. Long and variable key length made key exhaustive search and differential attack impossible. None fixed size key caused avoidance of replaying and other attacks that can happen on fixed sized key algorithms. Conclusion: Random process employed in this block cipher increased confidentiality of the message and dynamic length substitution in proposed algorithm may lead to maximum cryptographic confusion and consequently makes it difficult for cryptanalysis...|$|R
