40|$|AbstractThe {{object of}} this paper is to prove combinatorially several (13 of them) limit {{formulas}} relating different families of hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in Askey's chart classifying them. We first find a combinatorial model for Hahn polynomials which, as pointed out by Foata at the ICM (1983), “contains” models for Jacobi, Meixner, Krawtchouk, Laguerre and Charlier polynomials. Seven limit formulas are proved by “looking at surviving structures” when taking the limit. A simple model, T-structures, is then used to prove (using a different technique) four <b>more</b> <b>limit</b> formulas involving Meixner-Pollaczek, Krawtchouk, Laguerre, Charlier and Hermite polynomials. The theory of combinatorial octopuses (of F. Bergeron) is recalled and two <b>more</b> <b>limits</b> are demonstrated using new models of Meixner-Pollaczek, Laguerre, Gegenbauer and Hermite polynomials...|$|R

5|$|Some {{philosophers}} and Christians resisted {{the demands of}} the body and the pleasures of food, and adopted fasting as an ideal.

As an urban lifestyle came to be associated with decadence, the Church formally discouraged gluttony, and hunting and pastoralism were seen as simple, virtuous ways of life.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{alignment}} {{techniques have}} traditionally been applied exclusively to proteins, as the primary biological macromolecules that assume characteristic three-dimensional structures. However, large RNA molecules also form characteristic tertiary structures, which are mediated primarily by hydrogen bonds formed between base pairs as well as base stacking. Functionally similar noncoding RNA molecules can be especially difficult to extract from genomics data because structure is more strongly conserved than sequence in RNA {{as well as in}} proteins, and the <b>more</b> <b>limited</b> alphabet of RNA decreases the information content of any given nucleotide at any given position.|$|E
