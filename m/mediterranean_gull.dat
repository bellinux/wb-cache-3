500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, pectoral sandpiper, <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>gull,</b> Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, crested tit, bearded tit, marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white egret, black kite, red-footed falcon, American golden plover, white-rumped sandpiper, white-winged black tern, alpine swift, red-rumped swallow, red-throated pipit, subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, dusky warbler, Radde's warbler, Arctic redpoll and rustic bunting. Their selection was based on different criteria from those previously used: more than 200 records in Britain ever, and more than 100 occasions in the last decade.|$|E

40|$|Survival and {{reproductive}} rates often {{decrease with increasing}} population density. Such negative density dependence reflects a changing net balance between the benefits and costs of presence of others with increasing density. When densities are low, however, survival {{and reproductive}} rates might increase rather than decrease with increasing density (Allee effect), for example in colonial species. Relationships between fitness and density are therefore expected to change with population density. We studied the relationship between apparent annual survival and population density in a population of <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Gulls</b> Larus melanocephalus from establishment onwards {{for a period of}} 13 years, using capture–recapture techniques. The results confirmed our expectation: apparent survival increased with density at low densities (i. e. an Allee effect), but survival decreased with density at high densities. Post-hoc analyses revealed that the Allee effect could only be shown for juveniles, not for adults, suggesting that the Allee effect might have been age-specific. These patterns in apparent survival reflect the combined effects of density on true survival and on permanent emigration, and both mechanisms are discussed. ...|$|R
5|$|Blakeney Point {{has been}} {{designated}} {{as one of the}} most important sites in Europe for nesting terns by the government's Joint Nature Conservation Committee. In the early 1900s, the small colonies of common and little terns were badly affected by egg-taking, disturbance and shooting, but as protection improved the common terns population rose to 2,000 pairs by mid-century, although it subsequently declined to no more than 165 pairs by 2000, perhaps due to predation. Sandwich terns were a scarce breeder until the 1970s, but there were 4,000 pairs by 1992. Blakeney is the most important site in Britain for both Sandwich and little terns, the roughly 200 pairs of the latter species amounting to eightper cent of the British population. The 2,000 pairs of black-headed gulls sharing the breeding area with the terns are believed to protect the colony as a whole from predators like red foxes. Other nesting birds include about 20 pairs of Arctic terns and a few <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>gulls</b> in the tern colony, ringed plovers and oystercatchers on the shingle and common redshanks on the salt marsh. The waders' breeding success has been compromised by human disturbance and predation by gulls, weasels and stoats, with ringed plovers particularly affected, declining to 12 pairs in 2012 compared to 100 pairs twenty years previously.

40|$|International audienceScientific {{investigation}} in offshore areas are logistically challenging and expensive, therefore the availableknowledge on seabird at sea distribution and abundance, {{as well as}} their seasonal variations, remains limited. To investigate the seasonal variability in seabird distribution and abundance in the North-WesternMediterranean Sea (NWMS), we conducted two large-scale aerial surveys in winter 2011 – 12 and summer 2012, covering a 181, 400 km 2 area. Following a strip-transect method, observers recorded a total of 4141 seabird sightings in winter and 2334 in summer, along 32, 213 km. Using geostatistical methods, we generatedsightings density maps for both seasons, as well as estimates of density and abundance. Most taxa showedseasonal variations in their density and distribution patterns, as they used the area either for wintering or forbreeding. Highest densities of seabirds were recorded during winter, although large-sized shearwaters, stormpetrels and terns were more abundant during summer. Consequently, with nearly 170, 000 seabirds estimated inwinter, the total abundance was twice higher in winter. Coastal waters of the continental shelf were generallymore exploited by seabirds, even though some species, such as <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>gulls,</b> black-headed gulls, littlegulls and storm petrels were found at high densities in highly offshore waters.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{pollution}} caused by severe anthropogenic {{pressure in the}} Mediterranean Sea, an important biodiversity hotspot, requires continuous research efforts. Sources of highly toxic chemicals such as Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are misunderstood in representative Mediterranean species, which limits our capability to establish proper conservation strategies. In the present study, eggs of Audouin's and yellow-legged gulls (Larus audouinii and L. michahellis) were used to investigate the trophic sources, as measured by δ 13 C, δ 15 N, and δ 34 S, of legacy POPs, in particular, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs) and non-ortho polychlorinated biphenyls (no-PCBs), as well as recently-regulated POPs, e. g., polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Special {{attention was paid to}} the usefulness of rarely-explored δ 34 S ratios in explaining POP exposure in wildlife, and δ 34 S was the isotopic ratio that best explained POP variations among gulls in most cases, thus demonstrating its usefulness for understanding POP exposure in wildlife. Significant relationships between stable isotope signatures and POP concentrations revealed increasing levels of no-PCBs and low halogenated PCDD/Fs and PBDEs in <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>gulls</b> as the consumption of marine resources increases. In contrast, highly chlorinated and brominated congeners appeared to preferentially accumulate in gulls feeding primarily on refuse from dump sites and terrestrial food webs. The use of suitable dietary tracers in the study of POPs in yellow-legged gulls revealed the importance of dump sites as a source of POPs in Mediterranean seabirds, which has not previously been reported. In contrast, the preferential accumulation through marine food webs of low chlorinated PCCD/Fs and no-PCBs, which show the highest toxic equivalents factors (TEFs), led to a significantly greater toxicological concern in Audouin's as compared to yellow-legged gulls. Audouin's gull exposure to POPs appears primarily related to the pelagic food webs commonly exploited by fisheries, highlighting the need for further research given the potential impact on human consumption...|$|R

40|$|Des de la perspectiva d’una àrea d’hivernada, el meu estudi es centra en l’ecologia de poblacions d’una espècie migratòria, a partir de la hipòtesi que els agrupaments hivernals d’ocells constitueixen veritables poblacions. Investigo la composició, estructura i dinàmiques de la població a {{diverses}} escales espacials, i el lligam entre les àrees de reproducció i hivernada connectades mitjançant les rutes migratòries. El meu model d’estudi és una població hivernant de Gavines Capnegres Larus melanocephalus formada per individus provinents de diversos orígens, una fracció dels quals han estat marcats individualment amb anelles de colors. El sistema d’estudi a la costa catalana constitueix la principal àrea d’hivernada de l’espècie a nivell mundial. Mitjançant anàlisis de captura-recaptura, estimo alts nivells de supervivència interanual local (0, 81), indicatius d’una alta fidelitat a l’àrea d’hivernada que no canvia amb l’edat individual. La població s’estructura espacialment com a metapoblació, amb subpoblacions independents demogràficament. Un model probabilístic permet inferir la ruta migratòria dels ocells joves en llur primera migració; aquesta és una combinació de rutes fluvials i costaneres, cercant la mínima distància sobre terreny favorable. A escala local, l’espècie mostra alts nivells de rotació d’individus i freqüents moviments entre localitats, sense destí concret, i una baixa probabilitat de residència local (0, 56). Les necessitats espacials de la població, superiors a una sola localitat, demostren la falta d’adequació amb la distribució de les àrees protegides per a espècies amb alta mobilitat. Comparant els darrers 60 anys, la distribució reproductora ha experimentat una espectacular expansió (increment areal, 750 %) mentre que la distribució hivernal ha augmentat de manera moderada (25 %). La població mundial ha romàs estable, indicant que el seu creixement pot estar limitat per esdeveniments de l’època hivernal. Allà on entren {{en contacte}} les poblacions reproductora en expansió i la hivernant, interactuen poc i mantenen dinàmiques independents. Aquest treball contribueix a millorar la comprensió de les dinàmiques poblacionals durant l’hivern i demostra com l’estudi de l’ecologia durant una part del cicle anual pot ajudar a comprendre el que succeeix la resta de l’any. La ‘visió des dels quarters d’hivernada’ pot aportar una informació important i complementària als estudis durant l’època reproductora. The winter period is {{typically associated with}} harsh weather conditions and reduced food availability, which may lead to increased mortality. In birds, a common strategy to avoid such risks is to migrate to more favourable grounds, but its demographic costs are largely unknown. The wintering season remains a black box in {{our knowledge of the}} life cycle of birds. From the perspective of a wintering area, I study the population ecology of a migratory species, based on the hypothesis that winter aggregations of birds constitute true populations, instead of random aggregations of individuals. I look at the population composition, structure and dynamics across several spatial scales, and the link between the wintering and breeding areas through connecting migratory routes. My study model is a population of wintering <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Gulls</b> Larus melanocephalus made of birds from multiple origins, a significant proportion of which have been individually marked with individually-coded colour-rings in their natal or breeding colonies. The study system constitutes the species’ main winter quarters globally and is situated on the Mediterranean coast of E-NE Spain. Capture-recapture analyses reveal high estimates of apparent local interannual survival after the first year (0. 81 on average), indicating a high individual winter site-fidelity that does not vary with age. This attachment to the wintering area models the distribution of individuals, shaping them into a spatially structured population with metapopulation dynamics, as each subpopulation has independent demography, determined by area-specific survival and low levels of dispersal. Using a probability model, I infer the migratory route followed by first-winter birds; the most likely path is a combination of fluvial and coastal routes, seeking minimal distance along favourable terrain. In the focus species, wintering populations are made of individuals from different sex and age classes, {{in one of the few}} documented cases of nondifferential migration. Exceptionally, the species also exhibits synheimy (the population in each distinct wintering area is made of birds from all the breeding populations), possibly as a result of its recent history. Individual choice of wintering area is made in the first migration according to a probability rule determined by distance, and is maintained through life. On a local scale, I find a very high turnover of individuals and a frequent movement, in no particular direction, among sites. The low monthly probability of local residency (0. 56) contrasts with the species’ strong site-fidelity to the general wintering area. Individual turnover shows that a single site may be visited by a large proportion of the regional (43 %) and global (18 %) populations every season. Thus, the population home range extends over an area much larger than a single locality or a protected area, showing evidence of a mismatch between the distribution of protected areas and the spatial needs of the population. Compared with data from 60 years ago, <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Gulls</b> have undergone a huge expansion of their breeding distribution range (750 % area increase) while the wintering distribution has increased only moderately (25 %). The global population size has remained stable, indicating that its growth may be limited by events taking place in the wintering season. As the breeding distribution continues to expand, where breeding and wintering populations come in contact, they interact little and follow independent dynamics. This work contributes to a better understanding of bird population dynamics in the wintering season and shows how the detailed study of a species’ ecology during one part of the annual cycle can help comprehend what happens during the rest of the year. The ‘view from the winter quarters’ can bring important and complementary information to the study of birds during the breeding period...|$|R

Several researchers present the results of long-term monitoring programmes and there are observations of rare species (but only those accepted by the Rareties Committee) or the more regular ones recorded in unusual numbers, or outside the normal dates of presence in the region. There were spells of severely cold weather in February 1986 and again, for the 3 rd consecutive winter, in January 1987, this latter being the more severe of the two. Flamingos and egrets suffered less than in January 1985 but passerines were hard hit, particularly Cetti's and Fan-tailed warblers and Bearded Tits. Rainfall over the two years was quite high {{and as a result}} the salinity of the Vaccarès lagoon dropped from 33 g/l to only 20 g/l by the end of 1987. All european grebes have been recorded in the delta and their numbers have increased on the Vaccarès where 1 000 or more Great-crested and around 3 000 Black-necked were censused both years. The Grey Heron breeding population continues to increase and there were a record 891 pairs censused in the Camargue area in 1986. In winter the Great White Heron is now a regular visitor with up to 35 individuals. Storks are still regular on migration with 8 Black and 43 White in autumn 1987. Record numbers of flamingos were again breeding in 1986 and 1987 with 20 000 and 17 500 pairs respectively and a record 8 590 chicks raised in 1986. In 1987, only 2 200 chicks were raised because of disturbance caused by a child's balloon blown onto the breeding island during hatching. The banding programme continues and 600 chicks were marked each year. During the cold spell of January 1987 about 100 flamingos died, one of the victims being marked with an Iranian ring from Lake Rezaiyeh. Waterfowl counts revealed record numbers of Shelducks in February, with 2 745 in 1986 and 3 590 in 1987. The Mute Swan breeding population continues to increase in the area and the Bewick's peaked at 105 in January 1986. A small flock of Grey-lag Geese now winters in the Camargue and one bird has been seen wearing a Swedish ring. Midwinter counts of ducks and coots have now been made over 24 consecutive seasons. Although Gadwall and Shoveler numbers have increased in recent years the overall numbers of ducks have decreased for the thirteenth consecutive winter. This decline is attributed mainly to excessive hunting and an increase in the salinity of Camargue lagoons. Other notorious winter visitors to the delta have been Sea and Booted Eagles in 1986 and 1987, and 7 cranes in 1986.
