5|$|The next {{match was}} The Undertaker against Batista in a Last <b>Man</b> <b>Standing</b> Match for the World Heavyweight Championship. At one spot, Undertaker leg dropped Batista through an {{announce}} table. Towards the end, the two fought up the entrance ramp, where Batista speared to The Undertaker off the stage. Neither man {{could get to}} their feet before the referee's count of ten; in result, the match ended in a draw. Due to WWE regulations, titles can't change hands in a Last <b>Man</b> <b>Standing</b> match by a draw, so The Undertaker remained champion.|$|E

5|$|John Cena and Randy Orton {{continued}} their feud over the WWE Championship, {{as the two}} were scheduled {{to compete in a}} Last <b>Man</b> <b>Standing</b> match for the title. The match, however, never occurred. On the October 1 episode of Raw, Cena defeated Mr. Kennedy in a non-title match. After the match, Orton attacked Cena and then counted to ten, which Cena was unable to answer to. Cena was legitimately injured in the match, and as a result, the following night on ECW on Sci Fi, Mr. McMahon vacated the WWE Championship because Cena's right pectoral tendon was legitimately torn while executing a hip toss during his match with Kennedy. At No Mercy, Mr. McMahon entered the ring and said that a new WWE Champion was to be crowned, and Orton was crowned as champion, but he was challenged by Triple H for the title on the spot. Triple H, however, defeated Orton to win the WWE Championship, but later that same night, Triple H lost the title to Orton back in a Last <b>Man</b> <b>Standing</b> match after a title defense against Umaga, who he was booked to face in a standard wrestling match.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{professional}} wrestling matches {{were scheduled}} on the event's supercard.

Also on the undercard, WWE Champion Triple H defeated Umaga to retain his title and Finlay and Rey Mysterio fought to a no contest.|$|E
5|$|A.J. Styles fought Kurt Angle in a Last <b>Man</b> <b>Standing</b> match next. In a Last <b>Man</b> <b>Standing</b> match, {{there are}} no {{disqualifications}} or count outs, instead to win the match the competitor has to force their opponent to {{not be able to}} reach a standing position by the count of 10. However, this match was only promoted as a Last <b>Man</b> <b>Standing</b> match, instead it was held under Texas Death match rules where a wrestler must pin or submit their opponent and then have them fail to respond to a count of 10. Styles got the first fall of the night, when he forced Angle to tap out to Angle's own signature submission maneuver the Ankle lock. Angle made it to his feet before the count concluded. Angle gained a pinfall later on in the match after slamming Styles off the top of a padded turnbuckle with a suplex. Before Styles could reach his feet to beat the count, Angle slammed Styles onto the mat back-first with his signature Olympic slam maneuver and gained another pinfall to start the count over. Styles beat that count as well, with Angle trying for the Olympic Slam again before Styles' countered it into his signature Styles' Clash maneuver and pinned Angle. After Angle reached his feet, Styles and Angle fought up a padded turnbuckle with Styles gaining the advantage. At this time, Styles grabbed Angle by the neck and fell backwards from the turnbuckle and drove Angle head-first into the mat. Angle failed to reach the 10 count afterwards, with Styles being declared the winner of the contest at 24 minutes and 50 seconds. Following the encounter, the referee called for medical attention for Angle who was scripted to appear as if he had suffered a neck injury. Styles then entered the ring once Angle reached his feet and lifted Angle up and dropped him on his head. As Styles walked up the ramp, he was attacked by Sting, who drove Styles' head into the ramp with his signature Scorpion Death Drop maneuver, as Kevin Nash looked on.|$|E

5|$|After four-month hiatus, Triple H {{returned}} to Raw on October 3, 2005 {{as part of}} WWE Homecoming. He teamed with fellow Evolution member Flair to defeat Chris Masters and Carlito.

5|$|Cena {{lost the}} {{championship}} back to Edge in a Last <b>Man</b> <b>Standing</b> match at Backlash after interference from Big Show, who chokeslammed Cena through a big spotlight. This resulted in Cena beginning a feud with Big Show in which Cena defeated Big Show at Judgment Day and at Extreme Rules in a submission match {{by applying the}} STFU. During Cena's feud with Big Show, The Miz challenged him to a match on the April 27 episode of Raw, but as Cena was out due to injury, Miz claimed an unofficial win via forfeit and continued to do this over the following weeks, until Cena defeated him in a singles match at The Bash.|$|E

5|$|It was {{a little}} strange. And {{definitely}} when I {{walked down the aisle}} I was like, 'This is kind of creepy — there’s some other <b>man</b> <b>standing</b> there!' It was really beautiful. People were all really excited like it was really my wedding. My mother was even like, 'Aww', and I was like, 'Mom, it's a video. This is not my dress. This is not the real wedding.' But I think it’s just one of those moments that every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|E
5|$|Punk {{then used}} {{the group to}} attack Randy Orton, blaming him for prematurely ending Punk's first World Heavyweight Championship reign in 2008. Punk and The Nexus cost Orton his match with The Miz for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble in January 2011. Orton, in turn, responded by taking {{out all of the}} New Nexus members by punting them in the head, leaving Punk alone as the sole {{surviving}} member of the group. This led to a WrestleMania XXVII match and a Last <b>Man</b> <b>Standing</b> match at Extreme Rules, both of which Punk lost.|$|E
