5|$|Stanisław Lem {{works were}} {{influenced}} by such masters of Polish literature as Cyprian Norwid and Stanisław Witkiewicz. His prose show a <b>mastery</b> of numerous genres and themes.|$|E
5|$|While Satyavati's {{presence}} of mind, far-sightedness and <b>mastery</b> of realpolitik is praised, her unscrupulous means of achieving her goals and her blind ambition are criticized.|$|E
5|$|As state superintendent, Paulus helped {{introduce}} statewide assessment {{testing for}} grades 3, 5, 8, and 11 in 1991. Other education reforms introduced that year were the Certificate of Initial <b>Mastery</b> (CIM) and Certificate of Advanced <b>Mastery</b> (CAM) {{that were designed}} to replace the high school diploma in Oregon. These were optional programs which {{were part of a}} broader program that included issuing a report card outlining the progress as a state, as required by a law the state legislature passed in 1991. Paulus also supported school to work initiatives for reforming public education while in office, which were part of the 1991 reforms. At the time Paulus was one of only ten women in the nation to hold the top education position in their state. She left the office on January 4, 1999, after two terms. In 2007, the Oregon Legislature eliminated the optional certificates from schools in the state.|$|E
5|$|On January 21, 2015, {{a mobile}} game titled Evolve: Hunter Quest {{appeared}} briefly on the iOS App Store {{and was later}} removed. The game was released by 2K on January 29, 2015 for iOS, Android, Windows Phone and Fire OS devices. The game is a free-to-play tile-matching video game, {{as well as a}} companion app to Evolve. In Evolve: Hunter Quest, players match three tokens of the same colour in order to unleash attacks on enemies, fill up energy bars to activate special Hunter abilities and earn <b>mastery</b> points to level up. <b>Mastery</b> points earned in-app can then be applied to characters in the main Evolve game on any platform. Players who download the app can also unlock unique game art and watch replays of online matches from a top-down view.|$|E
5|$|Potential {{students}} {{were expected to}} have undergone grammar, rhetoric and encyclopedic sciences studies. Another prerequisite was the <b>mastery</b> of Greek and Latin, given that the classical juridic references and imperial constitutions used in the teaching program were written in Latin. The aspirants could pursue their preparatory studies in public schools or have private tutors.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{place after}} the events of , the game focuses on Sora and Riku's Mark of <b>Mastery</b> exam {{in which they have}} to protect {{parallel}} worlds in preparation for the return of Master Xehanort. Besides controlling the two playable characters across a single scenario, the player is able to recruit creatures known as Dream Eaters that are able to assist in fights.|$|E
5|$|The letters {{first learned}} by a child, {{commonly}} their own name, {{may come to}} have lasting positive associations. Hoorens and Todorova tested this by looking for a name-letter effect in bilingual subjects where their mother tongue alphabet was Cyrillic and their foreign-language alphabet Roman. Because learning a foreign language at a later age does not typically involve extra attention given to name letters, {{there should be no}} name-letter effect in the foreign-language alphabet, only in the first-language alphabet. Results of a study with 100 Bulgarian subjects who at a later age learned English, German, French or Spanish revealed a name-letter effect for the Roman alphabet as well as for Cyrillic. The researchers concluded <b>mastery</b> pleasure is not the principle cause of the name-letter effect. In a follow-up study Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun tested the strength of the name-letter effect among elementary-school children, in a cross-sectional experimental design involving Flemish and Hungarian second, fourth, and sixth graders. Instead of finding the name-effect to decrease with age as might be expected, they found it increased, thus proving that <b>mastery</b> pleasure is not the principal cause. They also investigated name-letter effects in bilingual Thai subjects, some of whom had learned the English alphabet {{at the same time as}} the Thai alphabet, and others who had learned it later. They found that the time at which students had learned the second alphabet made no difference in the strength of the name-letter effect, thereby ruling out <b>mastery</b> pleasure as a co-determinant.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Elwood's hometown, {{the pair}} {{meet up with}} Gamma's long-time partner C.T. Smith, another wanted powder hunter. Smith has {{infiltrated}} the ranks of Ash Daughter, a gang which has found a Ring of the Dead. The three challenge the gang's leader, Ranewater Calder, and Gamma slays Calder using his <b>mastery</b> of the fictional sword art karin zanjutsu, a martial art which grants its users pyrokinesis. Elwood, Gamma, and Smith thereby gain a second Ring of the Dead, concluding the first arc and volume of the series.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Wynne, {{author of}} The Origin of Buddhist Meditation, observes that formless {{meditation}} and elemental meditation might have {{originated in the}} Upanishadic tradition. The earliest reference to meditation is in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, {{one of the oldest}} Upanishads. Chandogya Upanishad describes the five kinds of vital energies (prana). Concepts used later in many yoga traditions such as internal sound and veins (nadis) are also described in the Upanishad. Taittiriya Upanishad defines yoga as the <b>mastery</b> of body and senses.|$|E
5|$|Although largely {{indifferent}} to awards, Gielgud had the rare distinction of winning an Oscar, an Emmy, a Grammy, and a Tony. He was famous {{from the start}} of his career for his voice and his <b>mastery</b> of Shakespearean verse. He broadcast more than a hundred radio and television dramas between 1929 and 1994, and made commercial recordings of many plays, including ten of Shakespeare's. Among his honours, he was knighted in 1953 and the Gielgud Theatre was named after him. From 1977 to 1989, he was president of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Penhaligon– The {{protagonist of}} the book, Arthur {{is a human}} asthmatic, who was chosen by the Will of the Architect to become the Rightful Heir to the house. He owns the First, Second, and Third Keys, but is not in {{possession}} of them {{throughout most of the}} book. Arthur shows a strong sense of right and wrong, as well as a reliance on friends and allies to achieve his goal: the rightful <b>mastery</b> of the entire House.|$|E
5|$|Due to its perception-altering effects, {{the onset}} of {{narcosis}} {{may be hard to}} recognize. At its most benign, narcosis results in relief of anxiety– a feeling of tranquility and <b>mastery</b> of the environment. These effects are essentially identical to various concentrations of nitrous oxide. They also resemble (though not as closely) the effects of alcohol or cannabis and the familiar benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam and alprazolam. Such effects are not harmful unless they cause some immediate danger to go unrecognized and unaddressed. Once stabilized, the effects generally remain the same at a given depth, only worsening if the diver ventures deeper.|$|E
5|$|Gregory {{was also}} one of the first Christian voices to say that slavery as an {{institution}} was inherently sinful. He believed that slavery violated mankind's inherent worth, and the nature of humanity to be free; a departure from classical, and Judeo-Christian precedent which he rooted in Genesis, arguing that man was given <b>mastery</b> of animals but not of mankind. Although aspects of the slave system had been criticized by Stoics such as Seneca, this was the first and only sustained critique of the institution of slavery itself made in the ancient world.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{was born}} into a middle-class African-American family on January 17, 1899, in Richmond, Virginia. His father was a butcher at a German American owned meat shop, and his mother was a schoolteacher. As a result of his {{frequent}} contact with the meat shop's owner, Harris learned German and became a fluent speaker of the language. Harris' <b>mastery</b> of the language would help him later in life, when he examined the writings of German economists and social reformers like Karl Marx.|$|E
5|$|Matangi {{is one of}} the Mahavidyas, ten Tantric goddesses and {{a ferocious}} aspect of Devi, the Hindu Divine Mother. She is {{considered}} to be the Tantric form of Sarasvati, the goddess of music and learning. Like Sarasvati, Matangi governs speech, music, knowledge and the arts. Her worship is prescribed to acquire supernatural powers, especially gaining control over enemies, attracting people to oneself, acquiring <b>mastery</b> over the arts and gaining supreme knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people like}} themselves; {{the name is}} {{associated}} with the self, and hence the letters of the name are preferred, {{despite the fact that they}} appear in many other words. People who do not like themselves tend not to exhibit the name-letter effect. A similar effect has been found for numbers related to birthdays: people tend to prefer the number signifying the day of the month on which they were born. Alternative explanations for the name-letter effect, such as frequent exposure and early <b>mastery,</b> have been ruled out. In psychological assessments, the Name Letter Preference Task is widely used to estimate implicit self-esteem.|$|E
5|$|The figures, the {{minutely}} detailed clothes, and {{the architecture}} of the room and windows are depicted {{with a high degree of}} realism. Van Eyck's <b>mastery</b> at handling oil can be seen in the differing breadths of brush strokes. The precision of the detail achieved is especially noticeable in the rendering of threads of St. Donatian's blue and golden embroidered cope and mitre, in the weave of the oriental carpet, and in the stubble and veins on van der Paele's aging face.|$|E
5|$|The main {{contributor}} to the critical oblivion was the loss of archival documents or, indeed, the artwork itself, often dismembered if not destroyed. Only {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century, supported by new studies and the rediscovery of archival sources, has the <b>mastery</b> of Gasparo Cairano been revealed. While a catalog of his works of art has been reconstructed within the framework of the Renaissance in Brescia, the full story still suffers from gaps and there are still events to be clarified.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} reflects Bruegel's <b>mastery</b> of observation. Each {{figure has}} a different eye affliction, including corneal leukoma, atrophy of globe and removed eyes. The men hold their heads aloft to make better use of their other senses. The diagonal composition reinforces the off-kilter motion of the six figures falling in progression. It is considered a masterwork for its accurate detail and composition. Copies include a larger version by Bruegel's son Pieter Brueghel the Younger, and the work has inspired literature such as poetry by Charles Baudelaire and William Carlos Williams, and a novel by Gert Hofmann.|$|E
5|$|The {{process is}} {{versatile}} {{and can be}} performed with relatively inexpensive equipment, making it well suited to shop jobs and field work. An operator can become reasonably proficient with a modest amount of training and can achieve <b>mastery</b> with experience. Weld times are rather slow, since the consumable electrodes must be frequently replaced and because slag, the residue from the flux, must be chipped away after welding. Furthermore, the process is generally limited to welding ferrous materials, though special electrodes have made possible the welding of cast iron, nickel, aluminum, copper, and other metals.|$|E
5|$|Their {{painting}} demonstrates, {{more than}} any other figures on the ceiling, Michelangelo's <b>mastery</b> of anatomy and foreshortening and his enormous powers of invention. In their reflection of classical antiquity they resonate with Pope Julius' aspirations to lead Italy towards a new 'age of gold'; at the same time, they staked Michelangelo's claim to greatness. However, a number of critics were angered by their presence and nudity, including Pope Adrian VI who wanted the ceiling stripped.|$|E
5|$|There is {{insufficient}} historical {{evidence to support}} the claim he knew any skills beyond archery. Contemporary records never once mention Zhou teaching Yue boxing. Despite this, various wuxia novels and folk legends have attributed many different military and supernatural skills to Zhou. These range from <b>mastery</b> of the bow, double swords and Chinese spear to that of Wudang hard qigong, Chuojiao boxing and even X-ray vision. Wang Shaotang's folktale even represents him as a master of Drunken Eight Immortals boxing.|$|E
5|$|Willamette Law {{also offers}} a Clinical Law Program that gives law {{students}} hands-on, professional experience in law offices and courtrooms across the country. The program comprises four advanced legal education courses, including specialized clinics in Business Law, Trusts and Estates, Child and Family Advocacy, and Human Rights and Immigration. Clinical Law Program students are taught and expected to demonstrate the highest standards of excellence {{in all areas of}} legal practice, from <b>mastery</b> of substantive legal issues and procedures, to unwavering professionalism and notable service to the greater community.|$|E
5|$|A port of Titan Quest for mobile devices was {{developed}} under license from Nordic Games by DotEmu, a French developer {{who had previously}} developed a successful mobile port of Ys Chronicles I. The controls and interface were redesigned {{from the ground up}} to work for touchscreen controls, something the team spent months on. Despite the changes, the team worked to make the gameplay {{as close as possible to}} the original experience. They also put in additional options for actions such as targeting enemies with <b>mastery</b> abilities and searching for loot It released on May 19, 2016 for iOS. The Android version was released on July 7.|$|E
5|$|After swiftly {{recovering}} from the sack of Rome, the Romans immediately resumed their expansion within Italy. Despite their successes, their <b>mastery</b> of the whole of Italy {{was by no means}} assured. The Samnites were a people just as martial and as rich as the Romans and had the objective of their own to secure more lands in the fertile Italian plains on which Rome itself lay. The First Samnite War of between 343 BC and 341 BC that followed widespread Samnite incursions into Rome's territory was a relatively short affair: the Romans beat the Samnites in both the Battle of Mount Gaurus in 342 BC and the Battle of Suessula in 341 BC but were forced to withdraw from the war before they could pursue the conflict further due to the revolt of several of their Latin allies in the Latin War.|$|E
5|$|After their retreat, {{the native}} Theban kings found {{themselves}} trapped between the Canaanite Hyksos ruling {{the north and}} the Hyksos' Nubian allies, the Kushites, to the south of Egypt. After years of vassalage, Thebes gathered enough strength to challenge the Hyksos in a conflict that lasted more than 30 years, until 1555BC. The pharaohs Seqenenre Tao II and Kamose were ultimately able to defeat the Nubians to the south of Egypt, but failed to defeat the Hyksos. That task fell to Kamose's successor, Ahmose I, who successfully waged a series of campaigns that permanently eradicated the Hyksos' presence in Egypt. He established a new dynasty. In the New Kingdom that followed, the military became a central priority for the pharaohs seeking to expand Egypt's borders and attempting to gain <b>mastery</b> of the Near East.|$|E
5|$|Arafat's long {{personal}} and political survival was taken by most Western commentators {{as a sign of}} his <b>mastery</b> of asymmetric warfare and his skill as a tactician, given the extremely dangerous nature of politics of the Middle East and the frequency of assassinations. Some commentators believe his survival was largely due to Israel's fear that he could become a martyr for the Palestinian cause if he were assassinated or even arrested by Israel. Others believe that Israel refrained from taking action against Arafat because it feared Arafat less than Hamas and the other Islamist movements gaining support over Fatah. The complex and fragile web of relations between the US, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab states contributed also to Arafat's longevity {{as the leader of the}} Palestinians.|$|E
5|$|Because of his {{political}} connections and his <b>mastery</b> of French, McClellan received the assignment to be an official observer of the European armies in the Crimean War in 1855. Traveling widely, and interacting with the highest military commands and royal families, McClellan observed the siege of Sevastopol. Upon {{his return to the}} United States in 1856 he requested assignment in Philadelphia to prepare his report, which contained a critical analysis of the siege and a lengthy description of the organization of the European armies. He also wrote a manual on cavalry tactics that was based on Russian cavalry regulations. Like other observers, though, McClellan did not appreciate the importance of the emergence of rifled muskets in the Crimean War, and the fundamental changes in warfare tactics it would require.|$|E
5|$|Caprioli's {{memorial}} {{was broken}} {{up in the}} nineteenth century, so only the Caprioli Adoration remains. A masterpiece of Cairano's, this was placed in 1841 by Rodolfo Vantini on the high altar of the St Francis of Assisi church. Cairano demonstrates a high technical <b>mastery,</b> {{not only in the}} extremely precise orientation of the boxes, but also in the choice of the monolithic block, which, in fact, is not strictly necessary for this kind of work. From Bernardino Faino and Francesco Paglia and other seventeenth and eighteenth century scholars, we know that the relief was placed by some architectural system. It {{was supposed to be a}} figurative piece, created perhaps by the same artist, but which has not been traced.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{happens in}} real-time, {{featuring}} a hack and slash style where the player character attacks enemies highlighted with the mouse. As the character gains experience levels through completing quests and killing enemies, they can access <b>Mastery</b> skill trees linked to different combat styles, {{similar to a}} character class system: players can {{have access to a}} primary and secondary skill tree, which grand either passive or active boons upon characters. Items and equipment, which include new armor and weapons alongside healing potions, are acquired from defeated enemies or purchased from merchants. Players of the original Titan Quest can import their current selected character into Immortal Throne, while new players must complete the main campaign before accessing Immortal Throne.|$|E
5|$|Elgar's {{principal}} large-scale {{early works}} were for chorus and orchestra for the Three Choirs and other festivals. These were The Black Knight, King Olaf, The Light of Life, The Banner of St George and Caractacus. He also wrote a Te Deum and Benedictus for the Hereford Festival. Of these, McVeagh comments favourably on his lavish orchestration and innovative use of leitmotifs, but less favourably on {{the qualities of}} his chosen texts and the patchiness of his inspiration. McVeagh makes the point that, because these works of the 1890s were for many years little known (and performances remain rare), the <b>mastery</b> of his first great success, the Enigma Variations, {{appeared to be a}} sudden transformation from mediocrity to genius, but in fact his orchestral skills had been building up throughout the decade.|$|E
5|$|He {{continued}} {{to erect a}} further seven high-quality stelae until AD736, monuments that are considered masterpieces of Classic Maya sculpture with such <b>mastery</b> of detail that they represent the highest pinnacle of Maya artistic achievement. The stelae depict king Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil ritually posed and bearing the attributes {{of a variety of}} deities, including B'olon K'awiil, K'uy Nik Ajaw and Mo' Witz Ajaw. The king also carried out major construction works, including a new version of Temple26 that now bore the first version of the Hieroglyphic Stairway, plus two temples that have now been lost to the erosion of the Copán River. He also encased the Rosalila phase of Temple16 within a new phase of construction. He remodelled the ballcourt, then demolished it and built a new one in its place.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, under Albery's management, John Gielgud staged Romeo and Juliet at the New Theatre, co-starring with Peggy Ashcroft, Edith Evans and Olivier. Gielgud {{had seen}} Olivier in Queen of Scots, spotted his potential, and now {{gave him a}} major step up in his career. For the first weeks of the run Gielgud played Mercutio and Olivier played Romeo, after which they {{exchanged}} roles. The production broke all box-office records for the play, running for 189 performances. Olivier was enraged at the notices after the first night, which praised the virility of his performance but fiercely criticised his speaking of Shakespeare's verse, contrasting it with his co-star's <b>mastery</b> of the poetry. The friendship {{between the two men}} was prickly, on Olivier's side, {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|In Brussels, Rodin {{created his}} first {{full-scale}} work, The Age of Bronze, having returned from Italy. Modeled after a Belgian soldier, the figure {{drew inspiration from}} Michelangelo's Dying Slave, which Rodin had observed at the Louvre. Attempting to combine Michelangelo's <b>mastery</b> of the human form with his own sense of human nature, Rodin studied his model from all angles, at rest and in motion; he mounted a ladder for additional perspective, and made clay models, which he studied by candlelight. The result was a life-size, well-proportioned nude figure, posed unconventionally {{with his right hand}} atop his head, and his left arm held out at his side, forearm parallel to the body.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to her limitations {{with the human}} form, MacDonald points out that Potter's <b>mastery</b> in the depiction of rabbits attains full flower in The Flopsy Bunnies. Potter conveys the rabbits' thoughts and emotions with {{the position of the}} tail or the ear. Benjamin, Peter, his mother, and Flopsy all wear clothes, but Flopsy wears only an apron that exposes her tail and is thus incompletely clothed in comparison to her family and by human standards. But this incompleteness in dress permits her tail to be exposed and to precisely convey her apprehension as she approaches the house across the vast expanse of the lawn in search of her babies.|$|E
5|$|In {{selecting}} Ved Vejen for the Danish Culture Canon, {{the selection}} committee {{operating under the}} Danish Ministry of Culture explained that the attraction {{of the novel is}} that it portrays with considerable empathy how a meek young woman becomes increasingly aware of desires she hardly knew she possessed. With bittersweet irony, the author allows Katinka to develop her infatuation by listening to the heartaches of others. With its almost cinematic sequences, the novel conveys a balance between its subdued humour and a strong sympathy for what goes on in people's minds, especially in a secluded environment removed from mainstream society. It is not just Bang's portrayal of a bygone provincial world that seems so typically Danish but his <b>mastery</b> in making the hidden pain of loneliness so meaningful to today's readership. In 1988 it was made into a feature film Katinka, directed by Max von Sydow, starring Tammi Øst as Katinka.|$|E
