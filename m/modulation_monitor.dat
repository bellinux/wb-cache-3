However, {{it is unclear}} whether these error-related responses are sensitive to the magnitude of the error, or instead show all-or-none effects. We studied error-monitoring with ERPs while healthy adult participants performed ballistic pointing movements towards a visual target with or without optical prisms, in alternating runs. This allowed us to record variable pointing errors, ranging from slight to large deviations relative to the visual target. Behavioural results demonstrated a classic effect of prisms on pointing (i. e. initial shifts away from targets, with rapidly improving performance), as well as robust prismatic after-effects (i. e. deviations in the opposite direction when removing the prisms after successful adaptation). Critically, the amplitude of both ERN and Pe were strongly influenced by the magnitude of errors. Error-related ERPs were observed for large deviations, but their amplitudes decreased monotonically when pointing accuracy increased, revealing a parametric <b>modulation</b> of <b>monitoring</b> systems {{as a function of the}} severity of errors.

We investigated this issue by combining event-related potentials (ERPs) with a behavioral paradigm in which monitoring processes (non-monitoring vs. monitoring) and cognitive domains (spatial vs. verbal) were orthogonally manipulated in {{the same group of}} participants. They had to categorize 3 -dimensional visually presented words on the basis of either spatial or verbal rules.

The ERP results revealed that monitoring did not interact with domain, thus suggesting the involvement of common underlying mechanisms. Specifically, monitoring acted on low-level perceptual processes (as expressed by an enhanced visual N 1 wave and a sustained posterior negativity for monitoring trials) and on higher-level cognitive processes (involving larger positive <b>modulations</b> by <b>monitoring</b> trials over frontal and parietal scalp regions). The source reconstruction analysis of the ERP data confirmed that monitoring was associated with increased activity in visual areas and in right prefrontal and parietal regions (i. e., superior and inferior frontal gyri and posterior parietal cortex), which previous studies have linked to spatial and temporal monitoring.

Lack of compact and high power sources and detectors in this wavelength range has limited its use for various key applications. In this thesis, three different approaches adopted for the generation of THz radiation are discussed, quantum cascade lasers (QCLs), photoconductive emitters and photomixers and emphasis is given to photomixing. Photomixers generate continuous wave THz radiation by beating two independent laser beams on a semiconductor material. Beat frequency between the laser beams determines the emission frequency. In this work, two different materials, iron (Fe) – doped indium gallium arsenide (Fe:InGaAs) and Fe–doped indium gallium arsenide phosphide (Fe:InGaAsP) is used for THz photomixing at telecommunications wavelength. Characterizing the materials gave an idea about its intrinsic properties. With a standard antenna design, exemplar performance in terms of bandwidth (> 2. 4 THz) and output power was obtained from these materials. In order to improve the THz power from photomixers, two different electrode designs with nanometre dimensions were attempted on Fe:InGaAsP wafer. The spectral bandwidth and power from the emitters were studied at different bias orientations and polarizations. Mapping the emitters gave an insight into the geometrical dependence of the emission mechanism. The design was tested in a THz time domain system to confirm the results.

40|$|PURPOSE: Quantitative {{evaluation}} of early response proteins (ERPRO) and early response genes (ERG) following γ-irradiation of human lymphocytes; identification of specific proteins and genes as candidate biomarkers {{for the development}} of a novel biodosimeter. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were exposed to clinically relevant doses (1, 2 and 4 Gy) of γ-radiation ex-vivo. Analyses of protein and gene expression modulation were conducted 2 h post-irradiation. Global <b>modulations</b> were <b>monitored</b> using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2 D-PAGE) and DNA microarray analyses of the samples originating from one human donor. On the proteome level, both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated proteins were considered. Proteins and genes of specific interest were further targeted using Western blot (WB) and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) techniques, employing samples from several human donors (n= 3). RESULTS: A set of ERPRO and ERG showing significant alterations 2 h post-γ-irradiation have been identified in human lymphocytes. The most radiation responsive genes and proteins indicated alterations of cellular structure (ß-actin, talin- 1 [TLN 1], talin- 2, zyxin- 2), immune and defence reactions (major histocompatibility complex binding protein- 2 [MBP 2], interleukin- 17 E and interferon-γ), cell cycle control (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor- 1 A [CDKN 1 A], mouse double minute- 2, annexin-A 6 [ANXA 6], growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein-α [GADD 45 A], proliferating cell nuclear antigen [PCNA], dual specificity phosphatase- 2 and 8 [DUSP 8]) as well as detoxification processes (peroxin- 1) and apoptosis (B-cell lymphoma- 2 binding component- 3 [BBC 3]).

One of the most convincing observational arguments in favour of propagation-induced variability is the so called annual modulation of the characteristic variability time-scale, which is due to the orbital motion of the Earth. Data for the recently discovered and highly variable IDV source J 1128 + 5925 are presented. We study the frequency and time dependence of the IDV in this compact quasar. We measure the characteristic variability time-scale of the IDV throughout the year, and analyze whether the observed changes in the variability time-scale are consistent with annual <b>modulation.</b> We <b>monitored</b> the flux density variability of J 1128 + 5925 with dense time sampling between 2. 7 and 10. 45 GHz with the 100 m Effelsberg radio telescope of the MPIfR and with the 25 m Urumqi radio telescope. From ten observing sessions, we determine the variability characteristics and time-scales. The observed pronounced changes of the variability time-scale of J 1128 + 5925 are modelled with an anisotropic annual modulation model. The observed frequency dependence of the variation is in good agreement with the prediction from interstellar scintillation. Adopting a simple model for the annual modulation model and using also the frequency dependence of the IDV, we derive a lower limit to the distance of the scattering screen and an upper limit to the scintillating source size.

Our findings indicate left-hemisphere-dominant involvement of the sensorimotor cortex during own speech in natural conversation. The ~ 10 -Hz modulations could be related to preparation for starting one's own turn, already before the partner's turn has finished. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine whether}} mindfulness-based {{cognitive}} therapy (MBCT) would enhance attenuated amplitudes of event-related potentials (ERPs) indexing performance monitoring biomarkers of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS: Fifty adult ADHD patients {{took part in}} a randomised controlled study investigating ERP and clinical measures pre-to-post MBCT. Twenty-six patients were randomly allocated to MBCT, 24 to a wait-list control. Main outcome measures included error processing (ERN, Pe), conflict monitoring (NoGo-N 2), and inhibitory control (NoGo-P 3) ERPs concomitant to a continuous performance task (CPT-X). Inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity ADHD symptoms, psychological distress and social functioning, and mindfulness skills were also assessed. RESULTS: MBCT was associated with increased Pe and NoGo-P 3 amplitudes, coinciding with reduced 'hyperactivity/impulsivity' and 'inattention' symptomatology. Specific to the MBCT; enhanced Pe amplitudes correlated with a decrease in hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms and increased 'act-with-awareness' mindfulness skill, whereas, enhanced P 3 correlated with amelioration in inattention symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: MBCT enhanced ERP amplitudes associated with motivational saliency and error awareness, leading to improved inhibitory regulation. SIGNIFICANCE: MBCT suggests having comparable <b>modulation</b> on performance <b>monitoring</b> ERP amplitudes as pharmacological treatments. Further study and development of MBCT as a treatment for ADHD is warranted, in addition to its potential scope for clinical applicability to broader defined externalising disorders and clinical problems associated with impairments of the prefrontal cortex...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance spectroscopy of fluorine- 19 ((19) F NMR) has proven useful for evaluating kinetics of fluorinated chemotherapy drugs in tumors in vivo. This work investigated how three perfusion-enhancing vascular modifiers (BQ 123, thalidomide, and Botulinum neurotoxin type A [BoNT-A]) would affect the chemotherapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine, a fluorinated drug widely used in human cancer treatment. Murine tumor growth experiments demonstrated that only BoNT-A showed a strong trend to enhance tumor growth inhibition by gemcitabine (1. 7 days growth delay, P = 0. 052, Student t-test). In accord with these results, (19) F NMR experiments showed that only BoNT-A increased significantly the uptake of gemcitabine in tumors (50 % increase, P = 0. 0008, Student t-test). Further experiments on gemcitabine kinetics (NMR vs time) and distribution ((19) F MRI) confirmed the uptake-enhancing properties of BoNT-A. The {{results of this study}} demonstrate that (19) F NMR can <b>monitor</b> <b>modulation</b> of the pharmacokinetics of fluorinated chemotherapy drugs in tumors. The results also show that (19) F NMR data can give a strong indication of the effectiveness of perfusion-enhancing vascular modifiers for improving gemcitabine chemotherapy in murine tumors. (19) F NMR is a promising tool for preclinical evaluation of such vascular modifiers and may ultimately be used in the clinic to monitor how these modifiers affect chemotherapy...|$|R
40|$|Immune evasion in African trypanosomes is principally {{mediated}} by antigenic variation, but rapid internalization of surface-bound immune factors {{may contribute to}} survival. Endocytosis is upregulated approximately 10 -fold in bloodstream compared to procyclic forms, and surface coat remodeling accompanies transition between these life stages. Here we examined expression of endocytosis markers in tsetse fly stages in vivo and <b>monitored</b> <b>modulation</b> during transition from bloodstream to procyclic forms in vitro. Among bloodstream stages nonproliferative stumpy forms have endocytic activity similar to that seen with rapidly dividing slender forms, while differentiation of stumpy forms to procyclic forms is accompanied by rapid down-regulation of Rab 11 and clathrin, suggesting that modulation of endocytic and recycling systems accompanies this differentiation event. Significantly, rapid down-regulation of endocytic markers occurs upon entering the insect midgut and expression of Rab 11 and clathrin remains low throughout subsequent development, which suggests that high endocytic activity is not required for remodeling the parasite surface or for survival within the fly. However, salivary gland metacyclic forms dramatically increase expression of clathrin and Rab 11, indicating that emergence of mammalian infective forms is coupled to reacquisition of a high-activity endocytic-recycling system. These data suggest that high-level endocytosis in Trypanosoma brucei is an adaptation required for viability in the mammalian host...|$|R
