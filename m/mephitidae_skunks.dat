50|$|The Musteloidea {{consists}} of the families Ailuridae (red pandas), Mustelidae (mustelids: weasels, otters, martens, and badgers), Procyonidae (procyonids: raccoons, coatis, kinkajous, olingos, olinguitos, ringtails and cacomistles), and <b>Mephitidae</b> (<b>skunks).</b>|$|E
50|$|The hog-nosed skunks {{belong to}} the genus Conepatus and {{are members of the}} family <b>Mephitidae</b> (<b>skunks).</b> They are native to the Americas. They have white backs and tails and black underparts.|$|E
5000|$|A mesocarnivore is {{an animal}} whose diet {{consists}} of 50-70% meat with the balance consisting of non-vertebrate foods which may include fungi, fruits, and other plant material. Mesocarnivores are seen today among the Canidae (coyotes, many foxes), Viverridae (civets), Mustelidae (martens, tayra), Procyonidae (ring-tailed cat, raccoon), <b>Mephitidae</b> (<b>skunks),</b> and Herpestidae (some mongooses).|$|E
25|$|Sora {{eggs are}} eaten by several species {{including}} American minks (Mustela vison), <b>skunks</b> (<b>Mephitidae),</b> coyotes (Canis latrans), grackles (Quiscalus spp.), crows (Corvus spp.), and herons (Ardeidae). Predation of adult soras by American minks, coyotes and peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) has been reported.|$|R
5000|$|The Palawan stink badger (Mydaus marchei), or pantot, is a carnivoran of {{the western}} Philippines named for its {{resemblance}} to badgers, its powerful smell, and the largest island {{to which it is}} native, Palawan. Like all stink badgers, the Palawan stink badger was once thought to share a more recent common ancestor with badgers than with skunks. Recent genetic evidence, however, has led to their re-classification as one of the <b>Mephitidae,</b> the <b>skunk</b> family of mammals. [...] It {{is the size of a}} large skunk or small badger, and uses its badger-like body to dig by night for invertebrates in open areas near patches of brush. While it lacks the whitish dorsal patches typical of its closest relatives, predators and hunters generally avoid the powerful noxious chemicals it can spray from the specialized anal glands characteristic of mephitids.|$|R
2500|$|During hibernation, predators of Indiana bats {{may include}} black rat snakes (Pantherophis obsoletus) [...] and {{northern}} raccoons (Procyon lotor). During other {{times of the}} year northern raccoons have been observed trying to grab bats from the air when they attempt to fly away. <b>Skunks</b> (<b>Mephitidae),</b> Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), and feral cats (Felis catus) may pose a similar threat. If Indiana bats fly from their day roosts during the day, they may be susceptible to predation by hawks (Accipitridae). Indiana bats foraging at night may also be susceptible to predation by owls (Strigidae). While not a predator, woodpeckers (Picidae) may disturb roosting bats through their foraging activities by peeling away sections of bark being utilized by Indiana bats, causing Indiana bats to fly from the roost during the day and making the tree unsuitable for future habitation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most recent}} molecular-systematic DNA {{research}} places the red panda {{into its own}} independent family, Ailuridae. Ailuridae are, in turn, part of a [...] within the broad superfamily Musteloidea (Flynn et al., 2001) that also includes the Procyonidae (raccoons) and a group that further subdivides into the <b>Mephitidae</b> (<b>skunks)</b> and Mustelidae (weasels); {{but it is not}} a bear (Ursidae).|$|E
50|$|Family <b>Mephitidae</b> (<b>skunks</b> and stink badgers) {{was once}} {{classified}} as mustelids, but are now {{recognized as a}} lineage in their own right. The 12 species of skunks are divided into four genera: Mephitis (hooded and striped skunks, two species), Spilogale (spotted skunks, four species), Mydaus (stink badgers, two species) and Conepatus (hog-nosed skunks, four species). The two skunk species in the Mydaus genus inhabit Indonesia and the Philippines; all other skunks inhabit the Americas from Canada to central South America.|$|E
50|$|The {{superfamily}} Canoidea (or suborder Caniformia) - Canidae (wolves, {{dogs and}} foxes), <b>Mephitidae</b> (<b>skunks</b> and stink badgers), Mustelidae (weasels, badgers, and otters), Procyonidae (raccoons), Ursidae (bears), Ailuridae (red panda), Otariidae (eared seals), Odobenidae (walrus), and Phocidae (earless seals) (the last three families formerly {{classified in the}} superfamily Pinnipedia) and the extinct family Amphicyonidae (bear-dogs) - are characterized by having nonchambered or partially chambered auditory bullae, nonretractable claws, and a well-developed baculum. Most species are rather plain in coloration, lacking the flashy spotted or rosetted coats like many species of felids and viverrids have. This is because Canoidea tend to range in the temperate and subarctic biomes, although Mustelidae and Procyonidae have a few tropical species. Most are terrestrial, although a few species, like procyonids, are arboreal. All families except the Canidae and a few species of Mustelidae are plantigrade. Diet is varied and most tend to be omnivorous to some degree, and thus the carnassial teeth are less specialized. Canoidea have more premolars and molars in an elongated skull.|$|E
50|$|Carnivora are {{generally}} divided into the suborders Feliformia (cat-like) and Caniformia (dog-like), {{the latter of}} which includes the pinnipeds. The pinnipeds {{are part of a}} clade, known as the Arctoidea, which also includes the Ursidae (bears) and the superfamily Musteloidea. The Musteloidea in turn consists of the Mustelidae (mustelids: weasels), Procyonidae (procyonids: raccoons), <b>Mephitidae</b> (<b>skunks)</b> and Ailurus (red panda). The oldest caniforms are the Miacis species Miacis cognitus, the Amphicyonidae (bear-dogs) such as Daphoenus, and Hesperocyon (of the family Canidae, subfamily Hesperocyoninae). Hesperocyonine canids first appeared in North America, and the earliest species is currently dated at 39.74 mya, but they were not represented in Europe until well into the Miocene, and not into Asia and Africa until the Pliocene. Miacis and Amphicyonidae were the first of the caniforms to split from the others and are sometimes considered to be sister groups to Ursidae, but the exact closeness of Amphicyonidae and Ursidae, as well as Arctoidae to Ursidae, is still uncertain. The Canidae (wolves, coyotes, jackals, foxes and dogs) {{are generally}} considered to be the sister group to Arctoidea. The Ursidae first occur in North America in the Late Eocene (ca. 38 mya) as the very small and graceful Parictis that had a skull only 7 cm long. Like the canids, this family does not appear in Eurasia and Africa until the Miocene. The other caniform families Amphicyonidae, Mustelidae and Procyonidae occur in both the Old World and the New World by the Late Eocene and Early Oligocene.|$|E
40|$|The karyotypic {{relationships}} of skunks (Mephitidae) with other major clades of carnivores {{are not yet}} established. Here, multi-directional chromosome painting was used to reveal the karyological relationships among skunks and between <b>Mephitidae</b> (<b>skunks)</b> and Procyonidae (raccoons). Representative species from three genera of Mephitidae (Mephitis mephitis, 2 n = 50; Mephitis macroura, 2 n = 50; Conepatus leuconotus, 2 n= 46; Spilogale gracilis, 2 n = 60) and one species of Procyonidae (Procyon lotor, 2 n = 38) were studied. Chromosomal homology was mapped by hybridization of five sets of whole-chromosome paints derived from stone marten (Martes foina, 2 n = 38), cat, skunks (M. mephitis; M. macroura) and human.

Chromosomal homology was mapped by hybridization of five sets of whole-chromosome paints derived from stone marten (Martes foina, 2 n = 38), cat, skunks (M. mephitis; M. macroura) and human. The karyotype of the raccoon is highly conserved and identical to the hypothetical ancestral musteloid karyotype, suggesting that procyonids have a particular importance for establishing the karyological evolution within the caniforms. Ten fission events and five fusion events are necessary to generate the ancestral skunk karyotype from the ancestral carnivore karyotype. Our results show that Mephitidae joins Canidae and Ursidae as the third family of carnivores that are characterized by {{a high rate of}} karyotype evolution. Shared derived chromosomal fusion of stone marten chromosomes 6 and 14 phylogenetically links the American hog-nosed skunk and eastern spotted skunk...|$|E
40|$|Extant {{members of}} the order Carnivora split into two basal groups, Caniformia (dog-like carnivorans) and Feliformia (cat-like carnivorans). In this study we address phylogenetic {{relationships}} within Caniformia applying various methodological approaches to analyses of complete mitochondrial genomes. Pinnipeds are currently well represented with respect to mitogenomic data and here we add seven mt genomes to the non-pinniped caniform collection. The analyses identified a basal caniform divergence between Cynoidea and Arctoidea. Arctoidea split into three primary groups, Ursidae (including the giant panda), Pinnipedia, and a branch, Musteloidea, which encompassed Ailuridae (red panda), <b>Mephitidae</b> (<b>skunks),</b> Procyonidae (raccoons) and Mustelidae (mustelids). The analyses favored a basal arctoid split between Ursidae and a branch containing Pinnipedia and Musteloidea. Within the Musteloidea there was a preference for a basal divergence between Ailuridae and remaining families. Among the latter, the analyses identified a sister group relationship between Mephitidae and a branch that contained Procyonidae and Mustelidae. The mitogenomic distance between the wolf and the dog was shown {{to be at the}} same level as that of basal human divergences. The wolf and the dog are commonly considered as separate species in the popular literature. The mitogenomic result is inconsistent with that understanding {{at the same time as}} it provides insight into the time of the domestication of the dog relative to basal human mitogenomic divergences...|$|E
