5|$|During a {{surprise}} {{inspection of the}} Springfield Nuclear Power Plant from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Homer is placed in a test module van that simulates an emergency. He {{has no idea what}} to do and starts pressing buttons at random, somehow causing a nuclear meltdown even though there was no nuclear material inside the van. The NRC officials tell Mr. Burns that Homer's job requires college training in nuclear physics, and that he <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to college to keep his job. Homer is rejected by every college he applies to, but Mr. Burns helps him get into Springfield University.|$|E
5|$|Trying to {{sort out}} what has happened, Hermie goes back to Dorothy's house. Dorothy has fled the island {{in the night and}} an {{envelope}} is tacked to the front door with Hermie's name on it. Inside is a note from Dorothy, saying she hopes he understands she <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> home as there is much to do. She assures Hermie she will never forget him, and he will find his way of remembering what happened that night. Her note closes with the hope that Hermie may be spared the senseless tragedies of life.|$|E
5|$|Every so often, {{the player}} {{will come to}} a point where he or she is given the chance to choose from {{multiple}} options. The time between these points is variable and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer. Gameplay pauses at these points and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are four main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. The plot lines carry on from each other in a linear fashion. The game can end prematurely if the player makes the wrong decisions. When this occurs, the player <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to a previously saved spot and choose different decisions.|$|E

5|$|Mario's health {{consists}} of a three-piece health meter, which is depleted through contact with enemies and hazards. When swimming underwater, Mario has an air supply meter, which quickly depletes his main health meter if it runs out. Mario's health and air supply can be restored by collecting coins, or through touching bubbles if underwater. When the health meter becomes empty, the player loses a life and <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to a predetermined checkpoint. The health meter can be temporarily expanded to six units {{through the use of}} a Life Mushroom, with the maximum health returning to three units if the overall health falls to three units from enemy or hazard contact, or if Mario suffers instant death. Instant death can occur by being swallowed by quicksand or dark matter; falling into bottomless pits, which either consist of black holes or by leaving a planet's gravitational pull and falling into space. The player can obtain extra lives by collecting 1-Up Mushrooms, 50 coins without losing a life, or 50 Star Bits.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} {{of two major}} parallel dimensions, like time periods in Chrono Trigger, {{plays a significant role}} in the game. Players <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and forth between the worlds to recruit party members, obtain items, and advance the plot. Much of the population of either world have counterparts in the other; some party members can even visit their other versions. The player must often search for items or places found exclusively in one world. Events in one dimension sometimes have an impact in another—for instance, cooling scorched ground on an island in one world allows vegetation to grow in the other world. This system assists the presentation of certain themes, including the questioning of the importance of one's past decisions and humanity's role in destroying the environment. Rounding out the notable facets of Chrono Crosss gameplay are the New Game+ option and multiple endings. As in Chrono Trigger, players who have completed the game may choose to start the game over using data from the previous session. Character levels, learned techniques, equipment, and items gathered copy over, while acquired money and some story-related items are discarded. On a New Game+, players can access twelve endings. Scenes viewed depend on players' progress in the game before the final battle, which can be fought at any time in a New Game+ file.|$|E

One of these similarities is that indigenous Guatemalans used a palanquin to transport wealthy citizens and rulers.|$|E

25|$|The {{failure of}} German attacks in early April by , led Knobelsdorf to take {{soundings}} from the 5th Army corps commanders, who unanimously wanted to continue. The German infantry {{were exposed to}} continuous artillery fire from the flanks and rear; communications from the rear and reserve positions were equally vulnerable, which caused a constant drain of casualties. Defensive positions were difficult to build, because existing positions were on ground which had been swept clear by German bombardments early in the offensive, leaving German infantry with very little cover. The XV Corps commander, General Berthold von Deimling also wrote that French heavy artillery and gas bombardments were undermining {{the morale of the}} German infantry, which made it necessary to keep going to reach safer defensive positions. Knobelsdorf reported these findings to Falkenhayn on 20 April, adding that if the Germans did not go forward, they <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the start line of 21 February.|$|E

25|$|A drunken Raoul {{is sitting}} alone in a forlorn bar, contemplating the {{evolution}} {{of his relationship with}} Christine ("Why Does She Love Me?"). Meg enters and warns him that New York isn't a suitable place for his family, and she urges them to abandon Christine's performance contract and leave that night. Raoul refuses, citing their need for the money; he boasts that he is not afraid of the Phantom, unaware that his rival has since slipped in and replaced the barman behind the counter. When Meg leaves, the Phantom confronts Raoul and intimidates him with veiled remarks that cause him to question his paternity of Gustave. The Phantom also offers Raoul a bet: if Christine fails to perform tonight, the Phantom will pay off all their debts and allow them to leave together, but if she sings the aria he has written for her, Raoul <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to France alone. Raoul accepts the Phantom's dare and then experiences a moment of panic at what he has done ("Devil Take The Hindmost").|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{reported}} {{that if the}} 14th of Nisan falls on the Sabbath, Rabbi Meir taught that one must destroy leaven before the Sabbath (except for that required {{for the beginning of}} the Sabbath itself). But the Sages maintained that one destroys the leaven at its usual time (on the morning of the 14th). Rabbi Eleazar bar Zadok taught that one had to destroy consecrated meat before the Sabbath (because if any was left, none could eat it), and unconsecrated food at its usual time (because one could easily find eaters for it). The Mishnah taught that those on the way to perform religious duties who recollect leaven at home, if they are able to go back, destroy it, and then return to the religious duty, <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and destroy it. But if they cannot, then they annul it in their heart. Similarly, those on the way to save people from an emergency annul it in their heart. But those on their way to appoint a Sabbath station to set the limits of where they may travel on the Sabbath must return immediately to destroy the leaven. Similarly, those who left Jerusalem and recollected that they had consecrated meat with them, if they had passed Mount Scopus, they burned it where they were. But if they had not traveled that far, they returned and burned {{it in front of the}} Temple with the wood arranged for use in the altar. The Mishnah then discussed for what quantity they had to return. Rabbi Meir said for both leaven and consecrated meat, they had to return for a quantity as much as an egg. Rabbi Judah said when there was as much as an olive. But the Sages ruled that for consecrated meat, they had to return for as much as an olive; while for leaven, they had to return for as much as an egg.|$|E
500|$|Nielsen {{himself was}} {{ambiguous}} about his attitudes to late Romantic German music and to nationalism in music. He {{wrote to the}} Dutch composer Julius Röntgen in 1909 [...] "I am surprised by the technical skills of the Germans nowadays, and I cannot help thinking that all this delight in complication must exhaust itself. I foresee a completely new art of pure archaic virtue. What {{do you think about}} songs sung in unison? We <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>back...</b> to the pure and the clear." [...] On the other hand, he wrote in 1925 [...] "Nothing destroys music more than nationalism does... and it is impossible to deliver national music on request." ...|$|E

500|$|Dumville, {{commenting on}} these {{attempts}} {{to establish the}} historicity of the poem in 1988, said, [...] "The case for authenticity, whatever exactly we mean by that, is not proven; {{but that does not}} mean that it cannot be." [...] Likewise, Patrick Sims-Williams concluded in 2016 that, 'evaluating the supposed proofs that poems in the Books of Aneirin and Taliesin cannot go back to the sixth century, we have found them either to be incorrect or to apply to only a very few lines or stanzas that may be explained as additions. It seems impossible to prove, however, that any poem <b>must</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the sixth century linguistically and cannot be a century or more later'. The fact that the great majority of the warriors mentioned in the poem are not known from other sources has been put forward by several authors as an argument against the idea that the poem could be a later composition. The poems which are known to be later [...] "forgeries" [...] have clearly been written for a purpose, for example to strengthen the claims of a particular dynasty. The men commemorated in Y Gododdin do not appear in the pedigrees of any Welsh dynasty. Breeze comments, [...] "it is difficult to see why a later poet should take the trouble to commemorate men who, but for the poem, would be forgotten".|$|E
