25|$|There is a {{wide range}} of organic, or hydrocarbon, {{compounds}} in any given fuel mixture. The specific <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> gives a fuel its characteristic properties, such as boiling point, melting point, density, viscosity, etc. Some fuels like natural gas, for instance, contain only very low boiling, gaseous components. Others such as gasoline or diesel contain much higher boiling components.|$|E

25|$|The {{degradation}} of polymers to form smaller molecules may proceed by random scission or specific scission. The {{degradation of}} polyethylene occurs by random scission—a random breakage of the bonds that hold the atoms of the polymer together. When heated above 450°C, polyethylene degrades to form a <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> Other polymers, such as poly(alpha-methylstyrene), undergo specific chain scission with breakage occurring only at the ends. They literally unzip or depolymerize back to the constituent monomer.|$|E
25|$|The Nuclear Assisted Hydrocarbon Production Method, Canadian patent {{application}} 2,659,302, {{is a method}} for the temporary or permanent storage of nuclear waste materials comprising the placing of waste materials into one or more repositories or boreholes constructed into an unconventional oil formation. The thermal flux of the waste materials fracture the formation and alters the chemical and/or physical properties of hydrocarbon material within the subterranean formation to allow removal of the altered material. A <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> hydrogen, and/or other formation fluids is produced from the formation. The radioactivity of high-level radioactive waste affords proliferation resistance to plutonium placed in {{the periphery of the}} repository or the deepest portion of a borehole.|$|E
25|$|In {{catalytic}} reforming, a <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> with boiling points between 60–200°C is {{blended with}} hydrogen gas and then {{exposed to a}} bifunctional platinum chloride or rhenium chloride catalyst at 500–525°C and pressures ranging from 8–50 atm. Under these conditions, aliphatic hydrocarbons form rings and lose hydrogen to become aromatic hydrocarbons. The aromatic products of the reaction are then separated from the reaction mixture (or reformate) by extraction with any {{one of a number}} of solvents, including diethylene glycol or sulfolane, and benzene is then separated from the other aromatics by distillation. The extraction step of aromatics from the reformate is designed to produce aromatics with lowest non-aromatic components. Recovery of the aromatics, commonly referred to as BTX (benzene, toluene and xylene isomers), involves such extraction and distillation steps. There are a good many licensed processes available for extraction of the aromatics.|$|E

25|$|Carbides {{of varying}} stoichiometries {{are known for}} the {{lanthanides}}. Non-stoichiometry is common. All of the lanthanides form LnC2 and Ln2C3 which both contain C2 units. The dicarbides with exception of EuC2, are metallic conductors with the calcium carbide structure and can be formulated as Ln3+C22−(e–). The C-C bond length is longer than that in CaC2, which contains the C22− anion, indicating that the antibonding orbitals of the C22− anion {{are involved in the}} conduction band. These dicarbides hydrolyse to form hydrogen and a <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> EuC2 {{and to a lesser extent}} YbC2 hydrolyse differently producing a higher percentage of acetylene (ethyne). The sesquicarbides, Ln2C3 can be formulated as Ln4(C2)3. These compounds adopt the Pu2C3 structure which has been described as having C22− anions in bisphenoid holes formed by eight near Ln neighbours. The lengthening of the C-C bond is less marked in the sesquicarbides than in the dicarbides, with the exception of Ce2C3.|$|E
2500|$|The crude bitumen {{contained}} in the Canadian oil sands is described by the National Energy Board of Canada as [...] "a highly viscous <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> heavier than pentanes which, in its natural state, is not usually recoverable at a commercial rate through a well because it is too thick to flow." [...] Crude bitumen is a thick, sticky form of crude oil, so heavy and viscous (thick) {{that it will not}} flow unless heated or diluted with lighter hydrocarbons such as light crude oil or natural-gas condensate. At room temperature, it is much like cold molasses. [...] The World Energy Council (WEC) defines natural bitumen as [...] "oil having a viscosity greater than 10,000centipoise under reservoir conditions and an API gravity of less than 10° API". [...] The Orinoco Belt in Venezuela is sometimes described as oil sands, but these deposits are non-bituminous, falling instead into the category of heavy or extra-heavy oil due to their lower viscosity. [...] Natural bitumen and extra-heavy oil differ in the degree by which they have been degraded from the original conventional oils by bacteria. According to the WEC, extra-heavy oil has [...] "a gravity of less than 10° API and a reservoir viscosity of no more than 10,000centipoise".|$|E
