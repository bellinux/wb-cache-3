50|$|An {{inrush current}} limiter is a {{component}} used to limit inrush current to avoid gradual damage to components and avoid blowing fuses or tripping circuit breakers. Negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistors and fixed resistors {{are often used}} to limit inrush current. NTC thermistors {{can be used as}} inrush-current limiting devices in power supply circuits when added in series with the circuit being protected. They present a higher resistance initially, which prevents large currents from flowing at turn-on. As current continues to flow, NTC thermistors heat up, allowing higher current flow during normal operation. NTC thermistors are usually much larger than <b>measurement</b> <b>type</b> thermistors, and are purposely designed for power applications.|$|E

50|$|The {{graphical}} {{user interface}} has two views which can be toggled by clicking {{on one of the}} two tabs in the bottom left of the SPSS Statistics window. The 'Data View' shows a spreadsheet view of the cases (rows) and variables (columns).

The 'Variable View' displays the metadata dictionary where each row represents a variable and shows the variable name, variable label, value label(s), print width, <b>measurement</b> <b>type,</b> {{and a variety of other}} characteristics. Cells in both views can be manually edited, defining the file structure and allowing data entry without using command syntax. This may be sufficient for small datasets. Larger datasets such as statistical surveys are more often created in data entry software, or entered during computer-assisted personal interviewing, by scanning and using optical character recognition and optical mark recognition software, or by direct capture from online questionnaires.

40|$|Surface {{estimation}} can {{be performed}} based on position or depth measurements. We propose a method to fuse both types of measure-ments. Position measurements are obtained from landmarks on the surface, i. e., they are fixed {{to a certain point}} on the surface. In contrast, depth measurements reflect the depth measured along a line emanating from a depth camera and are not fixed to a position on the surface. The proposed approach uses a mixture of Cartesian and polar or spherical coordinate to treat both <b>measurement</b> <b>types</b> accordingly. By doing so, the uncertainties associated with the dif-ferent <b>measurement</b> <b>types</b> are explicitly considered. The presented method represents the surface by a spline and is applicable to both 2 D and 3 D applications.

40|$|The {{understanding}} {{of the type of}} inhibitory interaction {{plays an important role in}} drug design. Therefore, researchers are interested to know whether a drug has competitive or non-competitive interaction to particular protein targets. Method: to analyze the interaction types we propose factorization method Macau which allows us to combine different <b>measurement</b> <b>types</b> into a single tensor together with proteins and compounds. The compounds are characterized by high dimensional 2 D ECFP fingerprints. The novelty of the proposed method is that using a specially designed noise injection MCMC sampler it can incorporate high dimensional side information, i. e., millions of unique 2 D ECFP compound features, even for large scale datasets of millions of compounds. Without the side information, in this case, the tensor factorization would be practically futile. Results: using public IC 50 and Ki data from ChEMBL we trained a model from where we can identify the latent subspace separating the two <b>measurement</b> <b>types</b> (IC 50 and Ki). The results suggest the proposed method can detect the competitive inhibitory activity between compounds and proteins...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} evaluation of an evidence database {{on the effectiveness of}} risk management measures (RMMs) to control inhalation exposure. This database is referred to as Exposure Control Efficacy Library (ECEL). Methods: A comprehensive review of scientific journals in the occupational hygiene field was undertaken. Efficacy values for RMMs in conjunction with contextual information on study design, sampling strategy and <b>measurement</b> <b>type</b> (among other parameters) were stored in an MS Access database. In total, 433 efficacy values for six RMM groups (i. e. enclosure, local exhaust ventilation, specialized ventilation, general ventilation, suppression techniques and separation of the worker) were collected from 90 peer-reviewed publications. These RMM categories were subdivided into more specific categories. Results: Estimated average efficacy values ranged from 87 % for specialized ventilation to 43 % for general ventilation. Substantial variation in efficacy values was observed within RMM categories based on differences in selected covariables within each study (i. e. study design, sampling strategy, <b>measurement</b> <b>type</b> and others). More contrast in efficacy values was observed when evaluating more detailed subcategories. Conclusions: It is envisaged that ECEL will contribute to exposure modelling, but should be supplemented with expert opinion, preferably in a formal expert elicitation procedure. The work presented here should be considered as a first attempt to collate and analyse RMM efficacy values and inclusion of additional (unpublished) exposure data is highly warranted. © The Author 2008.

The {{purpose of these}} techniques is to offload as much traffic {{as possible from the}} macro-layer to the pico-layer since extra capacity is available in pico-cells. To achieve this objective, the absolute priorities of the cell reselection algorithm in idle mode and the thresholds of B 2 / 3 A events for inter-RAT HOs in connected mode have been statically modified to further offload the macro-layer. In addition, an algorithm to simplify the task of adjusting the B 2 / 3 A thresholds when the <b>measurement</b> <b>type</b> is based on the signal level has been proposed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a unified formal framework for integrated circuits (ICs) Trojan detection that can simultaneously employ multiple noninvasive side-channel <b>measurement</b> <b>types</b> (modalities). After formally defining the IC Trojan detection for each side-channel measurement and analyzing the complexity, we devise a new submodular {{formulation of the}} problem objective function. Based on the objective function properties, an efficient Trojan detection method with strong approximation and opti-mality guarantees is introduced. Signal processing methods for calibrating the impact of interchip and intrachip correlations are presented. We define a new sensitivity metric that formally quantifies the impact of modifications to each existing gate that is affected by Trojan. Using the new metric, we compare the Trojan detection capability of different <b>measurement</b> <b>types</b> for static (quiescent) current, dynamic (transient) current, and timing (delay) side-channel measurements. We propose four methods for combining the detection results that are gained from different measurement modalities and show how the sensitivity results {{can be used for}} a systematic combining of the detection results. Experi-mental evaluations on benchmark designs reveal the low-overhead and effectiveness of the new Trojan detection framework and provides a comparison of different detection combining methods.
