25|$|While not {{commenting on}} {{the reasons for the}} {{charging}} decisions as to any other persons, we can say that the reasons why <b>Mr.</b> <b>Libby</b> was not charged with an offense directly relating to his unauthorized disclosures of classified information regarding Ms. Wilson included, but were not limited to, the fact that Mr. Libby's false testimony obscured a confident determination of what in fact occurred, particularly where the accounts of the reporters with whom <b>Mr.</b> <b>Libby</b> spoke (and their notes) did not include any explicit evidence specifically proving that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Libby</b> knew that Ms. Wilson was a covert agent. On the other hand, there was clear proof of perjury and obstruction of justice which could be prosecuted in a relatively straightforward trial.|$|E
25|$|I {{respect the}} jury's verdict. But I have {{concluded}} that the prison sentence given to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Libby</b> is excessive. Therefore, I am commuting the portion of Mr. Libby's sentence that required him to spend thirty months in prison.|$|E
25|$|First, it {{was clear}} from very early in the {{investigation}} that Ms. Wilson qualified under the relevant statute (Title 50, United States Code, Section 421) as a covert agent whose identity had been disclosed by public officials, including <b>Mr.</b> <b>Libby,</b> to the press.|$|E

25|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Libby</b> {{was sentenced}} to thirty months of prison, two years of probation, and a $250,000 fine. In making the {{sentencing}} decision, the district court rejected {{the advice of the}} probation office, which recommended a lesser sentence and the consideration of factors that could have led to a sentence of home confinement or probation.|$|E
25|$|My {{decision}} to commute his prison sentence leaves {{in place a}} harsh punishment for <b>Mr.</b> <b>Libby.</b> The reputation he gained through his years of public service and professional work in the legal community is forever damaged.

At Libby's sentencing hearing, Libby's lawyers filed a response to the Government's sentencing request. Libby's filing read, in part, [...] "At the close of the government’s case, the defense moved to dismiss from the indictment the allegation that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Libby</b> had lied about his July 12 conversation with Ms. Miller, because the evidence did not support this allegation.

2500|$|The five-count {{indictment}} of Libby included perjury (two counts), {{obstruction of justice}} (one count), and making false statements to federal investigators (two counts).

60|$|Mrs. Breen hesitated {{between the}} duty of {{accompanying}} the young couple on their European travels, and that {{of going to the}} village where Libby's mills were situated,--in southern New Hampshire. She was not strongly urged to a decision by her children, and she finally chose the latter course. The mill property {{had been a long time}} abandoned before Libby's father bought it, and put it in a repair which he did not hasten to extend to the village. This had remained in a sort of picturesque neglect, which harmonized with the scenery of the wild little valley where it nestled; and Mrs. Breen found, upon the vigorous inquiry which she set on foot, that the operatives were deplorably destitute of culture and drainage. She at once devoted herself to the establishment of a circulating library and an enlightened system of cess-pools, to such an effect of ingratitude in her beneficiaries that she was quite ready to remand them to their former squalor when her son-in-law returned. But he found her work all so good that he mediated between her and the inhabitants, and adopted it with a hearty appreciation that went far to console her, and finally popularized it. In fact, he entered into the spirit of all practical reforms with an energy and intelligence that quite reconciled her to him. It was rather with Grace than with him that she had fault to find. She believed that the girl had returned from Europe materialized and corrupted; and she regarded the souvenirs of travel with which the house was filled as so many tokens of moral decay. It is undeniable that Grace seemed for a time, to have softened to, a certain degree of self-indulgence. During the brief opera season the first winter after her return, she spent a week in Boston; she often came to the city, and went to the theatres and the exhibitions of pictures. It was for some time Miss Gleason's opinion that these escapades were the struggles of a magnanimous nature, unequally mated, to forget itself. When they met she indulged the habit of regarding <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Libby</b> with eyes of latent pity, till one day she heard something that gave her more relief than she could ever have hoped for. This was the fact, perfectly ascertained by some summer sojourners in the neighborhood; that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Libby</b> was turning her professional training to account by treating the sick children among her husband's operatives.|$|R
5000|$|Critics {{argue that}} pardons {{have been used}} more often {{for the sake of}} {{political}} expediency than to correct judicial error. One of the more famous recent pardons was granted by President Gerald Ford to former President Richard Nixon on September 8, 1974, for official misconduct which gave rise to the Watergate scandal. Polls showed a majority of Americans disapproved of the pardon, and Ford's public-approval ratings tumbled afterward. Other controversial uses of the pardon power include Andrew Johnson's sweeping pardons of thousands of former Confederate officials and military personnel after the American Civil War, Jimmy Carter's grant of amnesty to Vietnam-era draft dodgers, George H. W. Bush's pardons of 75 people, including six Reagan administration officials accused or convicted in connection with the Iran-Contra affair, and Bill Clinton's commutation of sentences for 16 members of FALN in 1999 and of 140 people on his last day in office, including billionaire fugitive Marc Rich and his own brother, Roger Clinton. George W. Bush's commutation of the prison term of I. Lewis [...] "Scooter" [...] Libby was controversial. In commuting Libby's prison term, Bush stated, [...] "I am commuting the portion of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Libby's</b> sentence that required him to spend thirty months in prison," [...] while leaving intact Libby's fine, remaining sentence, and felony conviction. In 2017, Barack Obama commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning.|$|R

He added, however, that [...] "anybody at that high-level position had a unique and special obligation before they said anything about anything associated with a national security agency ... make every conceivable effort" [...] to verify their status before releasing information about them.
