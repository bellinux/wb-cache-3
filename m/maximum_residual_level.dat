Milk residues of eprinomectin reached a maximum of 0. 55 +/- 0. 18 microg/kg and 1. 70 +/- 0. 31 microg/kg at the single and double doses, respectively. The drug concentrations decreased progressively until the fifth day after treatment, when they were less than the detection limit at both dose rates. The eprinomectin levels measured in all cheese types (both treatments) were higher than those recovered in milk at all the sampling times. In caciotta cheeses, the eprinomectin residues levels were constantly higher than other cheeses. With the exception of cheeses made with milk the first day after treatment, eprinomectin concentrations were nearly constant up to the fourth day then decreased by the fifth and sixth days after treatment.

The objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate cadmium levels in appendages and also in digestive gland, well-known to be the most site for cadmium storage and detoxification. For this purpose, concentrations of cadmium were determined in Warty Crab (Eriphia verrucosa) collected from the southern Tyrrhenian Sea by means of microwave digestion and atomic absorption spectrometry. Cd concentrations were found very low in all samples of muscle from crab appendages (< LOQ). Digestive gland showed Cd concentrations ranging between 0. 931 and 4. 612 mg kg- 1 (mean value 3. 107 mg kg- 1). Therefore, preliminary results show that cadmium concentrations were largely below the MLR established by the European Commission for muscle from crab appendages (Reg CE 1881 / 2006). Digestive gland showed the highest metal concentration. The observed results highlighted that the consumption of organs and tissues included in crab body such as abdomen, gonads and, in particular, digestive gland, very probable in certain populations of Mediterranean region due to the traditional and unusual consumption of raw and whole crustaceans, substantially increased the cadmium intake up to alarming values...|$|R

Food safety standards like <b>Maximum</b> <b>Residual</b> <b>Levels</b> (MRL) of any contaminant, apply indiscriminately to the domestic and foreign producers. The only divergence is that each country is free to adopt its own standard. In the context of pest and disease management, the phytosanitary protocols are not only set by each country independently but can also be discriminating between domestic and foreign producers but also across foreign producers. Moreover {{the level of the}} standard can vary greatly over time because a country may be affected by a pest or a disease regarding for instance favorable climatic conditions. Consequently a tightening in a partner standard may induce an increase in the cost of compliance with the standard and affect the competitiveness of countries that were major exporters, causing a redistribution of the market shares. Even if these standards have an incidental impact on trade, it is still interesting to measure it as the size of the impact can incentivize policymakers in negotiating bilateral phytosanitary requirements.

The Fe 3 O 4 @G-TEOS-MTMOS nanocomposite was characterized using Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, field emission {{scanning electron microscopy}} and X-ray diffraction. Separation, determination and quantification were achieved using gas chromatography coupled with micro electron capture detector. Adsorption capacity of the sorbent was calculated using Langmuir equation. MSPE was linear in the range 100 – 1000 pg mL− 1 for phosphamidon and dimethoate, and 10 – 100 pg mL− 1 for chlorpyrifos and diazinon, with limit of detection (S/N = 3) of 19. 8, 23. 7, 1. 4 and 2. 9 pg mL− 1 for phosphamidon, dimethoate, diazinon and chlorpyrifos, respectively.

Particularly, 3 fortification levels and the <b>Maximum</b> <b>Residual</b> <b>Level</b> (MRL) of 4 organophosphorus pesticide standard solutions were added in 18 matrices (15 belonging to 5 specific botanical categories and 3 botanically unclassified). The recoveries of the examined pesticides were determined using a simple official multiresidue method of detection, without any additional clean–up step. Recoveries were estimated based on standards prepared in solvent. The recovery percentages of the most polar pesticides, especially methamidophos (20. 2 – 288. 4 %), were much {{higher than those of}} non polar ones (chlorpyrifos and methidathion 25. 7 – 136. 4 % and 37. 6 – 292. 6 % respectively), except for quince. Pronounced matrix effects (> 120 %) were observed to the lowest fortification levels (MRLs established by EU), of dimethoate and methamidophos (i. e. the most polar analytes) in the majority of product extracts. Furthermore, it was proved that there is no correlation between the classification of plant products, according to their botanical characteristics, and the recoveries of pesticides in the equivalent extracts. Indeed, there were significant differences in the recoveries of pesticides in extracts, derived from matrices belonging to the same botanical group (especially in the categories of pome fruits and citrus). Consequently, it was shown that, under the examined conditions, obtaining recovery data, derived from only one representative matrix, with purpose to validate an official method in its botanical category is, possibly, an erroneous practice...|$|E

Fifty samples of imported frozen liver were randomly collected from different shops at Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate for isolation of S. typhimurium, S. enteritidies, and E. coli O 157 :H 7. The results revealed that for both microorganisms 4 % of the examined samples presumed to contain Salmonella and E. coli O 157 :H 7 organisms, according to the colonial character on Harlequin Salmonella ABC agar media and Harlequin SMAC-BCIG agar media. According to biochemical and serological identifications, both organisms could not be detected in the examined samples. A total of 29 (58 %) samples were positive for antibiotic residues, using the Premi test (a broad-spectrum screening test for the detection of antibiotic residues in meat) at or below the maximum residue limits. In addition, aflatoxin B 1 was detected in one (2 %) samples with a concentration of 1. 1  μg/kg. The results reflect that there was good hygiene practice for handling and preparation of frozen liver while selling to consumers.

40|$|People are {{encouraged}} to consume more fresh vegetables due to the high nutritional value and fibre contents in vegetables. At the same time, due to pesticidal residue in vegetables, vegetable consumption is considered as an important route of pesticides uptake by human beings. Pesticides, particularly organochlorines such as Aldrin, heptachlor and isomers of dichlorodiphe - nyltrichloroethane (DDT) and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) are a major concern because of their persistence, bioaccumulation, toxicity, and long-range environmental transport ability. Hence information on such toxic contaminants in vegetables is very essential, due to human health concern. In order to assess the potential health risks associated with vegetable consumption due to pesticidal residues of DDT and HCH, sixty four samples of commonly available vegetables were collected from a local market in West Bengal, India and analysed for DDT and HCH. In this study, estimated average daily intake of HCHs and DDTs through vegetables was ranged between 5. 0 x 10 – 8 – 9. 1 x 10 – 6 mg kg – 1 day – 1 with an average value of 2. 0 x 10 – 6 mg kg – 1 day – 1.

PVA-PEG graft co-polymer is a branched molecule consisting of about 75 % PVA and 25 % PEG units. The polymer is currently approved in pharmaceuticals in the EU. The specifications proposed {{are consistent with those}} for other already approved film-coating agents for use in the EU, including PVA and PEG, however, the Panel noted that no specifications for the impurities ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, 1, 4 -dioxane and ethylene oxide are presently included. The co-polymer is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In repeated dose oral toxicity studies in animals (rat, rabbit, and dogs) no adverse effects were shown. No chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity studies were provided, but no adverse effects following long-term consumption of PVA-PEG graft co-polymer are expected given the absence of any substance-related adverse effects in the shorter-term toxicity studies {{and the fact that the}} co-polymer is virtually not absorbed following oral administration. Based on in vitro and in vivo assays the co-polymer is found to be not genotoxic. From a subchronic feeding study in the dog a NOAEL of approximately 800 mg/kg bw/day (highest dose tested) was identified. Conservative intake estimates from food supplements amounted to 4. 3 mg/kg bw/day for children and 5 mg/kg bw/day for adults leading to a sufficient Margin of Safety compared to the NOAEL. From the <b>maximum</b> <b>residual</b> <b>level</b> of vinyl acetate Margins of Exposure of > 106 were calculated.

Recently the occurrence of dehydro PAs in teas and herbal teas has gained increasing attention from the EU, due to the high levels of dehydro PAs found in commercially available teas and herbal teas in Germany and Switzerland. Furthermore, several tropane alkaloids (TAs, e. g. scopolamine and hyoscyamine) intoxications due to the consumption of contaminated herbal teas were reported in the literature. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the dehydro PAs and TAs levels in 70 pre-packed teabags of herbal and non-herbal tea types sold in supermarkets in Israel. Chamomile, peppermint and rooibos teas contained high dehydro PAs levels in almost all samples analysed. Lower amounts were detected in black and green teas, while no dehydro PAs were found in fennel and melissa herbal teas. Total dehydro PAs concentrations in chamomile, peppermint and rooibos teas ranged from 20 to 1729 μg/kg. Except for black tea containing only mono-ester retrorsine-type dehydro PAs, all other teas and herbal teas showed mixed patterns of dehydro PA ester types, indicating a contamination by various weed species during harvesting and/or production.

These findings imply the need for better management of antibiotic use to control sources of food contamination and reduce health risks associated with the presence of residues and the development of resistant pathogens by further legislation and enforcement of regulations on food hygiene and use of antibiotics...|$|R

These parameters include the <b>maximum</b> <b>residual</b> stress,σ 0, half-width of the tensile residual stress region, b, and the redistribution of residual stress parameter, β. A normal distribution is assumed for all parameters {{considered in the}} investigation and fatigue life is determined using Forman equation. The results indicate that: (i) fatigue life decreases nonlinearly if the mean of random <b>maximum</b> <b>residual</b> stress and the half-width of tensile residual stress region increases; (ii) fatigue life increases nonlinearly if the rate of residual stress redistribution increases; (iii) the effects of COV of <b>maximum</b> <b>residual</b> stress, half-width of tensile residual stres...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} quality of the cocoa {{beverages}} produced in Nigeria with respect to the occurrence and levels of organochlorine pesticides OCPs residues in order to ascertain the potential health risks to the general public. Seven cocoa-based beverages were analysed for 17 OCP residues using gas chromatography coupled with an Electron Captured Detector (GC-ECD) after extraction and silica-gel clean-up. The study reveals the presence of ten OCP residues in the cocoa beverages, with a concentration range from not detected ND— 0. 256 mg/kg, while α-BHC, β-BHC, methoxychlor, p,p′-DDE, dieldrin, endrin aldehyde, and endosulfan sulphate were not detected in any of the analysed samples. The contamination pattern of OCPs in the beverages was in the following order: Ovaltine > Milo > Cadbury-choco > Bournvita > Cowbell-coffee > Richoco > Oluji, with p,p′-DDT being the most frequently found pesticide.

40|$|<b>Residual</b> <b>levels</b> {{of seven}} {{frequently}} used pesticides were investigated in 140 samples of two common vegetables, eggplants and tomatoes, from agricultural {{fields in the}} Narayanganj district of Bangladesh. The analysis of pesticide residues was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection. A {{large percentage of the}} eggplants (50 %) and tomatoes (60 %) from the Narayanganj district were contaminated with pesticides, and all of the levels were above the <b>maximum</b> <b>residual</b> limit (MRL) proposed by the EC regulation. Diazinon was the most common (35 %) pesticide detected in the vegetable samples at a concentration of 45 – 450 times higher than the MRL. The health risk index for diazinon was highest for both eggplant and tomato samples, which may be due to its physiochemical properties. Fenitrothion and linuron are the two second most common types of pesticides detected in the vegetable samples. Regular monitoring of the use of common pesticides on vegetables should be conducted...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{the bonding}} {{reliability}} of the COG devices was studied. A finite element analyses model was established to study the curing process of COG module. The equivalent stress of the different locations of the package structure and the change of the temperature distribution with time were studied. The heat transfer process and the conductive particle deformation process were displayed through the simulation. The {{results show that the}} curing process is the heat transformation and particle deformation process. The residual stress generated by the temperature difference between the curing temperature and the operated temperature. The results show that the <b>maximum</b> <b>residual</b> stress is in the most distorted places of the conductive particles. The <b>maximum</b> <b>residual</b> thermal stress was studied with different bump pitch (35 µm 30 µm 25 µm and 20 µm) {{and the size of the}} particles (5 µm, 4 µm and 3. 5 µm). It shows that for a certain size of the particles, the <b>maximum</b> <b>residual</b> thermal stress will decrease when the bump pitch decreases.

Moreover, since the <b>maximum</b> <b>residual</b> crack widths were not obtained directly from experimental results, {{the relationship between the}} <b>maximum</b> <b>residual</b> crack widths and the reduction factors was not reliably obtained. Therefore, this work considers full-size RC column specimens to confirm reduction factors of strength, stiffness and energy dissipation capacity.

40|$|AbstractCommunication {{costs are}} an {{important}} factor in the performance of massively parallel algorithms. We present a new asynchronous parallel algorithm for solving sparse linear systems that reduces communication compared to other algorithms on distributed memory machines. Implemented using passive one-sided remote memory access (RMA) MPI functions, the new method is a variation of the Southwell method, where rows are relaxed greedily, instead of sequentially, by choosing the row with the <b>maximum</b> <b>residual</b> norm. A process relaxes its rows if it holds the <b>maximum</b> <b>residual</b> norm among its neighbors at any given moment. Experimental results show that this method reduces communication costs compared to several other asynchronous iterative methods and the classic synchronous Jacobi method...|$|R
