50|$|Both DTL and DFSG can fit the {{requirement}} of low density system (using DTL) and higher density system (using DFSG). The DFSG terminal is similar to DTL terminal except instead of two super groups many super groups are combined. A <b>Mastergroup</b> of 600 channels (10 super-groups) is an example based on DFSG.|$|E
50|$|The UCC-4 {{comprised}} 12 {{voice frequency}} channels {{in the range}} of 300 to 3000 hertz, which made up a group. Five groups formed a supergroup and ten supergroups formed a <b>mastergroup,</b> thus making it expandable to 600 voice frequency channels or more, and compatible with the contemporary L-carrier of AT&T Long Lines.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were even}} {{higher levels of}} multiplexing, and it became {{possible}} to send thousands of voice channels down a single circuit. For example, Type L-4 system used the [...] "Multi-Master Group" [...] system to stack six U600 mastergroups into the L4 line spectrum, while the same hardware was modified to take three of these MMG spectra and stack them into an early L5 line spectrum. Later advancements in technology allowed for even more stacking on the Type L-5E, allowing 22 mastergroups to be stacked into a 66 MHz line spectrum. The accompanying diagrams are {{of the process of}} a Bell System A type channel bank forming a <b>mastergroup</b> in three stages.|$|E
5000|$|In long {{distance}} systems, supergroups were multiplexed into <b>mastergroups</b> of 300 voice channels (European CCITT hierarchy) or 600 (AT&T Long Lines Type L-600 Multiplex) for transmission by coaxial cable or microwave.|$|R

40|$|AIM:To {{compare the}} {{accuracy}} of conventional contact A-scan and IOL Master in measuring axial length and anterior chamber depth, and to evaluate the characteristics of these two different methods. METHODS:Totally 145 cases(189 eyes) who underwent phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation in our hospital from January 2015 to December 2016 were observed prospectively. They were divided into five groups according to ocular axial length measured by IOL <b>Master(Group</b> A: AL≤ 22 mm, Group B: 22 mm 28 mm). The axial length and anterior chamber depth were measured by A-scan and IOL Master respectively before operation, corneal curvature was measured by IOL Master. AL≤ 22 mm using Hoffer Q formula to calculate the crystal degree, AL> 22 mm using Haigis formula to calculate the crystal degree. Analysis of axial length, anterior chamber depth and mean absolute refractive error at 3 mo after surgery. RESULTS:The axial length measured by A-scan and IOL-master: Group A were 21. 48 ± 0. 41 mm and 21. 46 ± 0. 40 mm(P > 0. 05); Group B were 23. 13 ± 0. 62 mm and 23. 14 ± 0. 63 mm(P > 0. 05); Group C were 25. 24 ± 0. 56 mm and 25. 27 ± 0. 59 mm(P > 0. 05); Group D were 26. 97 ± 0. 59 mm and 27. 03 ± 0. 64 mm(P > 0. 05); Group E were 30. 76 ± 1. 40 mm and 31. 01 ± 1. 53 mm(P P > 0. 05); Group B were 0. 48 ± 0. 34 D and 0. 45 ± 0. 32 D(P > 0. 05); Group C were 0. 56 ± 0. 32 D and 0. 49 ± 0. 40 D(P > 0. 05); Group D were 0. 64 ± 0. 16 D and 0. 50 ± 0. 22 D(P > 0. 05); Group E were 0. 91 ± 0. 47 D and 0. 62 ± 0. 29 D(P P P > 0. 05). Anterior chamber depth measured by A-scan and IOL Master:Group A were 2. 81 ± 0. 35 mm and 2. 82 ± 0. 41 mm(P > 0. 05); Group B were 3. 04 ± 0. 50 mm and 3. 10 ± 0. 47 mm(P > 0. 05); Group C were 3. 55 ± 0. 62 mm and 3. 60 ± 0. 52 mm(P > 0. 05); Group D were 3. 42 ± 0. 24 mm and 3. 51 ± 0. 30 mm(P > 0. 05); Group E were 3. 50 ± 0. 28 mm and 3. 61 ± 0. 34 mm(P > 0. 05). CONCLUSION:IOL Master and contact A-scan have {{a high degree of}} consistency in the biological measurement, IOL Master has higher accuracy for patients with high myopia and long axis. It is a simple, accurate, good-repeatable and non-contact measurement tool...|$|E
