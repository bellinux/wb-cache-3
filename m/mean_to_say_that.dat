Upon {{completing}} the work, she wrote to her friend William Roscoe: [...] "I am dissatisfied with myself for not having done justice to the subject.– Do not suspect me of false modesty– I <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> had I allowed myself more time I could have written a better book, {{in every sense of}} the word... I intend to finish the next volume before I begin to print, for it is not pleasant to have the Devil coming for the conclusion of a sheet fore it is written." [...] When Wollstonecraft revised the Rights of Woman for the second edition, she took the opportunity not only to fix small spelling and grammar mistakes but also to bolster the feminist claims of her argument. She changed some of her statements regarding female and male difference to reflect a greater equality between the sexes.|$|E
500|$|Prince Albert Victor died in 1892, but society {{gossip about}} his sex life continued. Sixty {{years after the}} scandal the {{official}} biographer of King George V, Harold Nicolson, was told by Lord Goddard, who was a twelve-year-old schoolboy {{at the time of}} the scandal, that Prince Albert Victor [...] "had been involved in a male brothel scene, and that a solicitor had to commit perjury to clear him. The solicitor was struck off the rolls for his offence, but was thereafter reinstated." [...] In fact, none of the lawyers involved in the case was convicted of perjury or struck off at the time, indeed most had very distinguished careers. However, Arthur Newton was struck off for 12 months for professional misconduct in 1910 after falsifying letters from another of his clients—the notorious murderer Harvey Crippen. In 1913, he was struck off indefinitely and sentenced to three years' imprisonment for obtaining money by false pretences. Newton may have invented and spread the rumours about Prince Albert Victor in an attempt to protect his clients from prosecution by forcing a cover-up. State papers on the case in the Public Record Office, released to the public in the 1970s, provide no information on the prince's involvement other than Newton's threat to implicate him. Hamilton Cuffe wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Augustus Stephenson, [...] "I am told that Newton has boasted that if we go on a very distinguished person will be involved (PAV). I don't <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I for one instant credit it—but in such circumstances as this one never knows what may be said, be concocted or be true." [...] Surviving private letters from Somerset to his friend Lord Esher, confirm that Somerset knew of the rumours but did not know if they were true. He writes, [...] "I can quite understand the Prince of Wales being much annoyed at his son's name being coupled with the thing... we were both accused of going to this place but not together... I wonder if it is really a fact or only an invention." [...] In his correspondence, Sir Dighton Probyn refers to [...] "cruel and unjust rumours with regard to PAV" [...] and [...] "false reports dragging PAV's name into the sad story". When Prince Albert Victor's name appeared in the American press, the New York Herald published an anonymous letter, almost certainly written by Charles Hall, saying [...] "there is not, and never was, the slightest excuse for mentioning the name of Prince Albert Victor." [...] Biographers who believe the rumours suppose that Prince Albert Victor was bisexual, but this is strongly contested by others who refer to him as [...] "ardently heterosexual" [...] and his involvement in the rumours as [...] "somewhat unfair".|$|E

While a part of a complex whole, economic practice is a [...] "structure in dominance": it plays a major part in determining the relations between other spheres, and has more effect on them than they have on it. The most prominent aspect of society (the religious aspect in feudal formations and the economic aspect in capitalist ones) is called the [...] "dominant instance", and is in turn determined [...] "in the last instance" [...] by the economy. For Althusser, the economic practice of a society determines which other aspect of that society dominates the society as a whole.|$|E
2500|$|Bakhtin briefly {{outlined}} the polyphonic concept of truth. He criticized the assumption that, if two people disagree, {{at least one}} of them must be in error. He challenged philosophers for whom plurality of minds is accidental and superfluous. For Bakhtin, truth is not a statement, a sentence or a phrase. Instead, understanding is a number of mutually addressed, albeit contradictory and logically inconsistent, statements. Understanding needs a multitude of carrying voices. It cannot be held within a single mind, or be expressed by [...] "a single mouth". The polyphonic truth requires many simultaneous voices. Bakhtin does not <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> many voices carry partial truths that complement each other. A number of different voices do not make the truth if simply [...] "averaged" [...] or [...] "synthesized". Rather, it is the fact of mutual addressivity, of engagement, and of commitment to the context of a real-life event, that distinguishes understanding from misunderstanding.|$|E
2500|$|Thiers rose {{to speak}} and declared: [...] "Do you really <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> for a {{question}} of form, you have decided to release torrents of blood?" [...] He demanded to see proof that Prussia had really insulted France. The members of the right wing parties jeered and hooted Thiers, and one Deputy called out, [...] "you are the anti-patriotic trumpet of disaster!" [...] Thiers responded, [...] "I find this war extremely imprudent. More than anyone else I want to repair the results of Sadowa, but I find the occasion extremely badly chosen." [...] The {{right wing of the}} Assembly [...] erupted with insults, calling him a traitor, a fool and worthless old man. After the session, he was insulted in the streets and a crowd gathered to throw stones at his house. The Assembly, confident of success, ignored Thiers and voted on 19 July to declare war. That evening Thiers told a friend, the Deputy Buffet, [...] "I know the state of the military in France and that in Germany. We're lost." ...|$|E

2500|$|German philosopher Karl Jaspers {{believed}} that Spinoza, in his philosophical system, did not <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> God and Nature are interchangeable terms, {{but rather that}} God's transcendence was attested by his infinitely many attributes, and that two attributes known by humans, namely Thought and Extension, signified God's immanence.

But Spinoza insists that [...] "no attribute of a substance can be truly conceived from which {{it follows that the}} substance can be divided" [...] (Which means that one cannot conceive an attribute in a way that leads to division of substance), and that [...] "a substance which is absolutely infinite is indivisible" [...] (Ethics, Part I, Propositions 12 and 13). Following this logic, our world should be considered as a mode under two attributes of thought and extension.

2500|$|Gillespie was criticised for {{defacing}} a Make Poverty History poster {{signed by}} all the acts at the Glastonbury Festival in 2005. Gillespie scribbled over this and wrote [...] "Make Israel History." [...] Gillespie later {{said that he did}} this in support of Palestine, and when questioned on whether he was anti-Semitic, he responded [...] "There's Israeli and Jewish people who support the Palestinian cause as well. We did a lot of work for the Hoping Foundation to raise money for children in the Palestinian refugee camps and the lady who got us involved is Bella Freud, Lucian Freud's daughter and Sigmund Freud's great granddaughter. They had to flee Austria to escape Nazi persecution, and she believes in the Palestinian cause. To say we're anti-Semitic is a smear, so you'd better watch what you're saying. Because you oppose one country's government's policies doesn't <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> you hate all the people from that country. I don't like Bush or Putin or Tony Blair, but I don't hate American, Russian or British people. Most people are just trying hard to get by."

The statement was prompted by the use of Primal Scream's song [...] "Rocks" [...] at the Conservative Party Conference.|$|E

2500|$|Criticism slowly mounted: {{when the}} Whigs {{introduced}} a Poor Law Amendment Bill in 1841 {{to extend the}} Commission's life, MPs complained of the pettiness {{of some of the}} rules called for by the Poor Law Commission (e.g. workhouse inmates to take their meals in silence), of the refusal of the Commissioners to allow Boards of Guardians much discretion, and of the way the Commission had evaded Parliamentary scrutiny. A general election occurred before the Bill was passed, and the Conservatives came to power, with some of their MPs stating that they owed their seats to the opposition they had professed to the New Poor-law; the government, however, came forward with a Bill to extend the Commission to 1847, and to make minor amendments to the Poor Law. [...] Whilst there continued to be cross-party Front Bench support for the New Poor Law (in 1844 in Coningsby, Benjamin Disraeli mocked Peel's 'sound Conservative government' as 'Tory men and Whig measures') Conservative malcontents such as Disraeli were alive to the consequent opportunity to undermine Peel by allying themselves with the opposition to unpopular Whig measures. [...] The Bill made very slow progress (opponents made lengthy speeches; Fielden repeatedly moved adjournment of the debate), and many clauses were dropped in order to secure its passage before the existing authorisation of the Commission lapsed. [...] The previous proceedings of the Poor Law Commission were not endorsed unequivocably : ("My Lords, I don't <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I approve of every act that has been done in carrying this bill into operation. I think that in many cases those who had charge of the working of the bill have gone too far") it was now stressed that the virtue of the Commission was that it supported diversity, rather than that it was necessary to achieve uniformity; administratively 'special rules' were to be as far as possible consolidated into general rules laid before Parliament. A further Poor Law Amendment Act was passed in 1844; its main effect was to again revise the treatment of unmarried mothers: in Committee stage many amendments seeking to relax the poor law regime were rebuffed by the Home Secretary on the argument that - correctly understood - the existing rules and regulations of the Poor Law Commission already permitted the relaxation sought.|$|E
