The inspection was performed on April 24, 2013, by the Federal Lands Bridge Office, {{an arm of the}} FHWA. In its post-inspection report, the FHWA declared the bridge to be [...] "in poor condition overall due to continuing problems related to corrosion of the steel in the bascule span, deterioration of the concrete in the arch spans, and deterioration of the sidewalks and wearing surface." [...] Among the problems noted in the report: moderate amounts of rusting were found on all the bridge's load-bearing beams, there were moderate to widespread cracks in the reinforced concrete arch spans, <b>metal</b> <b>flakes</b> (or [...] "spalls") were coming off the steel beams on the road deck's underside, and the drainage system was clogged in many places by debris or rust.|$|E

5000|$|Like in-line spinners, skirt {{material}} {{options are}} many and {{depend on the}} body/target/action profile desired. Skirts are either tied on or attached by a latex or silicone collar to the lead body molded on the hook. For bass, silicone skirts have recently dominated the field over hair or [...] "living" [...] rubber skirts {{because of all the}} available molded-in patterns, <b>metal</b> <b>flakes,</b> and incandescent colors. The skirt's pulsating, fluttering motion caused by blade spin is the same as for in-line spinners, but the body target is rounder and has more action with the similar retrieve or a pause in retrieve. The skirt also adds resistance, which can enable the user to retrieve the bait slower depending on how many strands are used; but again, minimum or maximum speed capability depends on blade size and shape. The length of the skirt is typically 1/4-inch past the curve of the hook, but some anglers prefer longer or shorter skirts in order to produce different profiles and action.|$|E
30|$|We want {{to mention}} that all these nanocarbons can keep their uniform {{distribution}} status after removing the functional groups or surfactants during high-temperature heat treatment. Figure  4 c shows that SWCNT–graphene/Al composite powders with uniformly dispersed hybrid structure can be kept after a thermal reduction process at 500  °C. It was supposed that the residual functional groups adsorbed on <b>metal</b> <b>flakes</b> after thermal annealing {{may be responsible for}} the unchanged uniform distribution of nanocarbons on <b>metal</b> <b>flakes.</b> The flexibility, non-destructive nature, and high efficiency of the dispersion method make the mass production of various nanocarbon-reinforced metal matrix composite powders practicable.|$|E
40|$|The rolling-mill back-up rolls {{operate under}} high {{specific}} pressures conditions and are produced of high-carbon steel, prone to {{hot and cold}} cracking. Therefore crack resistance increase is an important scientific and technical problem. The impact of the electrode shape and heat input on the arc motion, and heat affected zone, the size of which determines the cold cracks formation and deposited <b>metal</b> <b>flaking</b> has been found. The arc moves along the electrode end face along the longitudinal axis or perpendicular to the weld pool in dependence on the ribbon position. The arc movement governs the heat input in the pool and if the surfacing regime is constant, the heating and cooling rates of the molten metal and heat affected zone as well. At surfacing with a perpendicular ribbon the heat affected zone decreases; at surfacing with a longitudinal ribbon and wire the heat affected zone increases. At surfacing with a composite electrode the heat affected zone reduces sharply while resistance to cracking and wearing increases. With the heat input reduction in weld pool side edges the heat affected zone reduces as well. At high speed surfacing with low heat input, the heat affected zone reduces, the tendency to cold cracking and deposited <b>metal</b> <b>flaking</b> decrease, welding stresses and specific pressure decrease, what results in resistance to cracking increase {{as well as the}} increase in wearing resistance. When energy decreases the deposited metal quality increases. Energy minimum results in maximum quality. The process of energy-saving high-speed deposition with low heat input, which provides microstructure reduction, heat input in the base metal and heat affected zone decrease, prevent cold cracking and deposited <b>metal</b> <b>flaking</b> increases both rolling mill back-up cracking resistance and wearing resistance has been develope...|$|R

5000|$|Educating {{himself in}} the {{libraries}} of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Mathus learned Latin, studied theater, poetry, First Peoples culture, literature and medieval alchemy, as well as music. It was during this time that he changed the spelling of his last name from [...] "Mathis" [...] to [...] "Mathus," [...] to reflect his respect for his and his mother's Latin studies.

30|$|Spherical Al, Mg, Ti, Fe, and Cu powders (99.99  % purity, mean {{particle}} size 10  μm) were ball milled in {{a stainless steel}} mixing jar at a speed of 352  rpm for 3  h in pure ethanol to make <b>metal</b> <b>flakes</b> with thickness of a few hundreds of nanometers. The <b>metal</b> <b>flakes</b> promote the compatibility between the metal powders and the nanocarbons {{in terms of the}} surface properties and morphologies [10]. Additionally, the high specific surface area of nanoflakes also greatly promotes the homogeneity and volume fraction of nanocarbons that can be dispersed in metal matrix.|$|E
30|$|The extreme {{condition}} {{is that both}} <b>metal</b> <b>flakes</b> and nanocarbons are failed to ionize spontaneously. Different charged surfactants should be applied to modify metal powders and nanocarbons with different charge characters. Cu, with positive standard reduction potential (+ 0.337  V), has no ability to ionize in aqueous solutions, and SDBS-treated SWCNT can be barely adsorbed on its surface (Fig.  3 f). This also indicates that the strength of van der Waals forces between nanocarbons and <b>metal</b> <b>flakes</b> are not strong enough for keeping SWCNT being absorbed on <b>metal</b> <b>flakes.</b> However, after modified by dodecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (DTAB), a kind of cationic surfactant, the surface of modified Cu flake was positively charged as revealed by the positive Zeta potential value (48.8  ±  2.6  mV) (Fig.  3 a). The DTAB solution has a high wetting ability for the Cu flakes, and therefore, DTAB particles with size of ~ 50  nm can be covered on Cu flakes after mixing Cu powders with DTAB solutions and subsequent filtering, rinsing, and drying of the modified powders. Consequently, through the electrostatic interactions between the positively charged Cu flakes and negatively charged SWCNT, uniform dispersion of SWCNT on Cu flakes can be obtained as revealed in Fig.  3 e. The above comparison also reveals that the strength of electrostatic interactions between charged nanocarbons and charged <b>metal</b> <b>flakes</b> is much stronger, as it can keep the nanocarbons attached after mild stirring and filtering process.|$|E
30|$|Realizing {{the uniform}} {{dispersion}} of nanocarbons such as carbon nanotube and graphene in metals, {{is an essential}} prerequisite to fully exhibit their enhancement effect in mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of metal matrix composites (MMCs). In this work, we propose an effective method to achieve uniform distribution of nanocarbons in various <b>metal</b> <b>flakes</b> through a slurry-based method. It relies on the electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged nanocarbons and the positively charged <b>metal</b> <b>flakes</b> when mixed in slurry. For case study, flake metal powders (Al, Mg, Ti, Fe, and Cu) were positively charged in aqueous suspension by spontaneous ionization or cationic surface modification. While nanocarbons, given examples as carboxylic multi-walled carbon nanotubes, pristine single-walled carbon nanotube, and carbon nanotube–graphene oxide hybrid were negatively charged by the ionization of oxygen-containing functional groups or anionic surfactant. It was found that through the electrostatic interaction mechanism, all kinds of nanocarbons can be spontaneously and efficiently adsorbed {{onto the surface of}} various <b>metal</b> <b>flakes.</b> The development of such a versatile method would provide us great opportunities to fabricate advanced MMCs with appealing properties.|$|E

40|$|This study {{focus on}} trying to {{understand}} what factors regarding bumper materials and coatings affect the radar transparency at 77 GHz. Dielectric spectroscopy was done at 25 unique samples, consisting of various plastic substrates, primers, basecoats and clearcoats with the Free-spaced method in the 60 - 90 GHz region. The plastic substrate consisted of Polypropylene-blend with different fillers such as talc, carbon black and <b>metal</b> <b>flakes.</b> The basecoats analyzed were 2 solid factory coatings (one black and one white), 5 factory coating containing different effect pigments such as <b>metal</b> <b>flakes,</b> Xiralic, and Mica, 1 factory PVD coating and 2 aftermarket basecoats. All samples were provided by a Volvo Cars’ supplier, however, some samples were repainted with the aftermarket coatings. The complex permittivites were calculated for each PP-blend and coating from the curve fitting of the measured S-parameters from the Free-spaced method. Material analysis such as thickness measurements of the plastic substrate and coatings, ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, TGA and DSC were done at all plastic substrates. The plastic substrates and the coating were also observed in optical microscope and in SEM. The calculated permittivities were compared with the results from the material analysis and correlations between increased metal content in the basecoat and higher real permittivity were found. Some relationship between the size of the <b>metal</b> <b>flakes</b> and the radar transparency could also be observed. Further, correlations between higher real permittivity with higher concentration of talc and carbon black were detected.
