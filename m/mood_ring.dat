Wasikowska {{said that}} the characters, [...] "both feel like outsiders and feel alone in their {{separate}} worlds, and have a special bond and friendship." [...] Burton explained that Depp [...] "tried to find a grounding to the character ... {{as opposed to just}} being mad." [...] Burton also said that, [...] "In a lot of versions it's a very one-note kind of character and you know [...] goal was to try and bring out a human side to the strangeness of the character." [...] The orange hair is an allusion to the mercury poisoning suffered by hatters who used mercury to cure felt; Depp believes that the character [...] "was poisoned ... and it was coming out through his hair, through his fingernails and eyes". Depp and Burton decided that the Hatter's clothes, skin, hair, personality and accent would change throughout the film to reflect his emotions. In an interview with Depp, the character was paralleled to [...] "a <b>mood</b> <b>ring,</b> [...] his emotions are very close to the surface". The [...] Hatter is [...] "made up of different people and their extreme sides", with a gentle voice much like the character's creator Lewis Carroll reflecting the lighter personality and with a Scottish Glaswegian accent (which Depp modeled after Gregor Fisher's Rab C. Nesbitt character) reflecting a darker, more dangerous personality. Illusionary dancer David [...] "Elsewhere" [...] Bernal doubled for Depp during the [...] "Futterwacken" [...] sequence {{near the end of the}} film.|$|E

5000|$|Cholesteric liquid {{crystals}} (CLCs) are the thin-film material {{often used}} to fabricate fish tank thermometers or <b>mood</b> <b>rings,</b> that change color with temperature changes. They change color because their molecules are arranged in a helical or chiral arrangement and with temperature the pitch of that helical structure changes, reflecting different wavelengths of light. Chiral Photonics, Inc. has abstracted the self-assembled structure of the organic CLCs to produce analogous optical devices using tiny lengths of inorganic, twisted glass fiber.|$|R

5000|$|Chiral Photonics’ {{technology}} is {{an outgrowth of}} the 1997 discovery by two of the company's co-founders, Azriel Genack and Victor Kopp, that lasing in cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) films is a result of their unique self-assembling helical (chiral) microstructure.

50|$|Thermochromism is the {{property}} of substances to change color due {{to a change in}} temperature. A <b>mood</b> <b>ring</b> is an excellent example of this phenomenon, but thermochromism also has more practical uses, e.g. in baby bottles (changes to a different color when cool enough to drink) or kettles (changes when water is at or near boiling point). Thermochromism is one of several types of chromism.|$|E

It was a hotbed of anti-abortion protests, church {{basement}} Bingo and Friday night fish fries. While the church was still reeling from the Second Vatican Council, society was being rocked by the Vietnam War, Watergate, birth control, a recession, an oil crisis, and various progressive movements championing African-Americans, women, Native Americans and the environment. It was a time of religious, political, and cultural upheaval that placed young people in opposition to their elders more {{than at any other time}} in recent history. Hair length alone was responsible for a thousand of dinner table fights. Almost all the families I knew were struggling to find their way forward and make sense of a way of life that was unraveling before their eyes. It turns out that <b>mood</b> <b>rings,</b> smiley faces, pet rocks and fuzzy dice affect people in all sorts of different ways." ...|$|R

At Westinghouse he began groundbreaking work with cholesteric liquid crystals, forming the first industrial research group into the practical uses of the technology.

30|$|When {{participants}} were asked to suggest ways to improve the designs and functions of wearable products, NC wanted to improve the designs so that devices could be more fashionable (80 %) and not sporty, futuristic, high-tech, structured, or concrete looking; unnoticeable (30 %) so that they could be hidden or not stand out; changeable (30 %) so that the device could be personalized or matched with a variety of clothes in daily life; lightweight (20 %); small (20 %) so that the device could be more portable and worn for a long time; and suitable for versatility in users (20 %) such as elderly people to use. When asked about functions, they wanted to have accessories for tracking moods and feelings (20 %), such as nail polish, rings, or necklaces that can show when moods and feelings are changing dramatically or show the user’s current mood. NC 3 said, “Like with <b>mood</b> <b>rings</b> or <b>mood</b> necklaces in which the design/color could constantly change depending on the information it was receiving…it’d be cool {{to be able to tell}} from a glance that something is changing/updating.” Participants also commended about wanting cost (20 %) to be more reasonable. Low cost can lower the risk level of accepting new technologies or products (Rogers 2003). EX suggested more focus on functions. Specifically, they wanted to enhance schedule and task management skills (40 %), managing physical health (40 %), and tracking moods and feelings (30 %). For example, “I think that it would be really cool if somehow, there was something that was like reading your mind or that like could be like, “Oh, you had this like emotional pattern, you know, and you tensed up here” (#EX 6). The other suggested functions are monitoring physical attributes (20 %) such as body size and weight, and being customizable (20 %), with features such as modifying codes or pressing buttons to change functions or interfaces.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>mood</b> <b>ring</b> is a {{specialized}} liquid crystal thermometer, wearable on the finger. The ring is typically ornamented with a [...] gemstone (usually made of quartz or glass) which {{is either a}} clear capsule filled with thermochromic liquid crystal, or has a thin sheet of liquid crystal sealed underneath. Changes in temperature cause the crystal to reflect different wavelengths of light which changes {{the color of the}} stone. The liquid crystal used in mood rings is usually set up to display a [...] "neutral" [...] color at the average human skin temperature, which is approximately 34 °C.|$|E
50|$|Mike Link {{replaced}} Mike Pendleton as bassist in 1992. Like Ben Jacobs, {{he was in}} Randy's other band, Rose, at {{the time}} and was suggested by Randy.

He also was a member of Rose for the albums Healing, Intense Live Series Volume 3, Crazy Little World and Into The Unknown and played bass on Randy's <b>Mood</b> <b>Ring</b> project.
