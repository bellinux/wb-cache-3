This article suggests that in many cases — and in direct opposition to the collective-action-based models of international cooperation we are accustomed to seeing in the comparative and international political economy literatures — it is the latter (defensive) motivation that has been driving much of the action.

40|$|The {{resurgence}} of global interest in nuclear energy {{is fueled by}} growing energy demands, concerns of global warming, {{and the desire to}} diversify energy supply. In order for the nuclear renaissance to be safely realized, a number of concerns must first be addressed. Foremost among them are the dual-use nature of nuclear technology and the spread of nuclear weapons. As small nuclear power programs expand and new states introduce nuclear power into their electricity grid, states must {{decide whether or not to}} develop indigenous enrichment and reprocessing facilities that may be misused for a weapons program. One of the must discussed instruments to strengthen the nonproliferation regime and limit the dangerous spread of sensitive fuel cycle technologies is the multilateralzation of the nuclear fuel cycle. Through <b>multilateral</b> mechanisms, <b>multilateral</b> <b>arrangements</b> to the nuclear fuel cycle attempt to limit the spread of fuel cycle technologies by removing the incentives to do so. Concepts and proposals for <b>multilateral</b> <b>arrangements</b> have been around since the advent of nuclear energy in the 1940 s but have received a lukewarm response from the international community. It is postulated that this response is driven by difficulties <b>multilateral</b> <b>arrangements</b> have in addressing all of the motivations for the establishment of fuel cycle facilities. An investigation is presented within to detail the most powerful motivations that <b>multilateral</b> <b>arrangements</b> may have been overlooking to this date. In order to achieve this, three case studies are performed to uncover the most powerful motivations for the development of fuel cycle facilities. The motivations are complex and include a variety of economic, political, and potentially proliferation related incentives. Brazil, South Korea, and Iran are chosen for the case studies because they are currently in the process of introducing sensitive facilities into their nuclear fuel cycles, or are strongly considering it. Following the description of the various motivations for the pursuit of sensitive fuel cycle facilities, an analysis is provided to determine which, if any, of the proposed <b>multilateral</b> <b>arrangements</b> are in best position to be successfully implemented. The study found that the establishment of regional nuclear fuel cycle facilities and centers offers the greatest potential to strengthen the nonproliferation regime by targeting the state's political power incentives. Supply assurances do not address the needs of any of the studied states, indicating they are not applicable to well-developed nuclear power states or those in possession fuel cycle technologies. Supply assurances do however, provide strong confidence building measures in the establishment of regional fuel cycles. Lastly, the development of multilateral spent-fuel repositories may be the most sure-fired way to prevent the spread of reprocessing facilities. by Paul Youchak. Thesis (S. B.)

The prediction result of the model GARCH which vividly shows the phenomenon of the auto-regression of the exchange rate has indicated the level of the exchange rate yesterday could explain the circumstance of the change of exchange rate today. Meanwhile, the policy of the US exchange rate will affect the exchange rate of Korea won against US dollar and the volatility of foreign exchange rate. In the present situation of Korean economy in which the liberalization of capital and the independence of the central bank has been established, the choosing range of the exchange system could only be completely changeable exchange rate system or exchange rate system of <b>multilateral</b> <b>arrangement</b> like Europe. However, in terms of the condition of the world economy, the introduction of the latter system is too early. There is an idea that under the changeable exchange rate system which is the only choice, it is the right time to activate the main body of private economy, the financial derivatives market in which the exchange risk could be trade-off.

The paper also examines individual incentives to join <b>multilateral</b> clearing <b>arrangements.</b> We suggest that arrangements with restricted direct participation and tiered membership may be a natural response to the uneven distribution of total pre-settlement costs when agents are of heterogeneous credit quality and it is costly to individually tailor margin. ...|$|R

In lieu of traditional alliances, many states are embracing <b>multilateral</b> security <b>arrangements.</b> Placing an increased emphasis on economic security instead of military security. These states appear to be ranking economic development ahead of traditional security concerns. By focusing on economic growth, these nations would seem to be subordinating military security as a matter of foreign policy. To this end, nations in the region are increasingly viewing <b>multilateral</b> <b>arrangements</b> as a means to effect cooperative ventures. The Cold War strategies of nuclear deterrence, military predominance,and cooperation within the U. N. and within other bilateral alliances no longer adequately address America's national interests. In the rapidly evolving security environment, the United States is called upon to reaffirm these interests and to formulate additional policies to meet the challenge of a rapidly changing international environment. The need for a nuclear deterrent continues. The end of the Cold War and the budgetary restraints of the United States calls for a limited downsizing of American military capabilities. The increasing importance of economic factors in the security equation, particularly the proliferation of transnational organizations, shows clearly the need for a greater degree of multilateralization-both in political and economic activities.
