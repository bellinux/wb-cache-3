500|$|Speaking for MTV News, Jay-Z {{responded to}} Braxton's claims: [...] "I wouldn't {{want to take}} it from her. I don't even think like that. <b>My</b> <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> would be, 'Maybe I could call her up, maybe I could get on that record.' The most obvious [...] is it's neither one of our records. It's not like you made an {{original}} idea. She's not in hip-hop, but it happens in hip-hop often. We go to sample the same thing and my record came out first. I'm sorry. What can I do?" [...] He went on saying that if he had known they were both planning to sample the same Tupac song, he would have arranged a duet with her.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Tony Benn reiterated his {{previous}} opposition to European integration. Speaking to the Oxford Union on the alleged overshadowing of the EU debate by [...] "UKIP and Tory backbenchers", he said:I took {{the view that}} having fought [...] that we should now work with them, and co-operate, and that was <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> about it. Then how I saw how the European Union was developing, it was very obvious that what they had in mind was not democratic. ... And the way that Europe has developed is that the bankers and the multinational corporations have got very powerful positions, and if you come in on their terms, {{they will tell you}} what you can and cannot do. And that is unacceptable. My view about the European Union has always been not that I am hostile to foreigners, but that I am in favour of democracy ... I think they're building an empire there, they want us {{to be a part of}} their empire and I don't want that.|$|E
500|$|In {{reaction}} to the opening musical number about Terri Schiavo, Schiavo's brother, Bobby Schindler, Jr., said, [...] "My family was astonished at the cruelty and bigotry towards our beloved sister, and all disabled people that we witnessed in this show. <b>My</b> <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> was how this attempt at satire must have been enormously difficult and painful for my mother." [...] He continued, [...] "The depiction of Terri in the Family Guy episode on March 21 is not only inaccurate, it seems to take the position that certain people are simply not worthy of receiving medical care because they are viewed as burdens {{on the health care}} system." [...] In addition, Schindler has also stated that he hopes to soon enlist the aid of other advocacy groups to protest the episode, [...] "and perhaps see some sponsors end support of the show." [...] Other pro-life activists, including Jill Stanek, wrote of the opening, [...] "Last night's episode of Family Guy opened with a truly shocking scene [...] This is the same television series that had an abortion episode canceled in August 2009. Creator Seth MacFarlane's goal is [...] get buzz by being offensive." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 1935, Zhang {{returned}} to China at his family's request. [...] Hergé meanwhile set about preparing the strip {{for publication in}} book form through Casterman. Proud of this Adventure, he encouraged them to increase the level of marketing and advertising for the work. At their advice, he renamed the story from The Adventures of Tintin in the Far East to The Blue Lotus, commenting of this new title: [...] "It is short, it sounds Chinese and it is mysterious." [...] At Casterman's prompting, he also inserted a number of coloured plates throughout the work, and devised a new design for the front cover. The book was finally published in October 1936. Hergé {{was pleased with the}} product, commenting, [...] "I was just bowled over! It is the height of luxury and <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> was 'It's much too good for children!'... I was far from expecting that." [...] He sent a copy to Zhang, who replied to thank him. After news of its publication reached China, in 1939 political leader Chiang Kai-shek, who had enjoyed The Blue Lotus, asked his wife Soong Mei-ling to invite Hergé to visit them there, although he was unable to do so due to the impending Second World War. He finally took up her offer in 1973, visiting her on the island of Taiwan.|$|E
500|$|Jeremy Renner, {{who played}} the film's adult Hansel, has stated that his initial {{attraction}} came from a one sheet he was given even before seeing the script, showing Hansel and Gretel walking away and a witch burning at {{a stake in the}} background, which he found [...] "incredibly interesting" [...] (this scene was included in the finished film). He added, [...] "When I read the script, <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> was, 'I can’t believe this hasn’t been done yet.' It’s such a great idea with so much potential. That dynamic was definitely a big thing, I loved that what Tommy [...] wrote left so much room for character." [...] Wirkola said he wanted Renner in the role after seeing him in The Hurt Locker. Wirkola, who described Hansel as the [...] "loose cannon" [...] of the duo, gave him an additional character flaw of diabetes, in addition to the psychological scars that Hansel shares with his sister (in the original idea for the short film, Gretel was also suffering from eating disorder). Renner said it was a great escape for him [...] "as this was a fairytale with no stress like the other action movies I'd done recently. I was having so much fun hanging on a wire like Peter Pan, hanging onto a broom and doing other crazy stuff." [...] He stated, [...] "That {{was one of the most}} fun jobs I’ve ever had because there’s something magical about that old world, fantasy thing." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2010, when Jill's adoptive mother, Liz Foster (Julianna McCarthy), died, it {{was then}} learned that her {{biological}} father was Neil Fenmore. Walton stated: [...] "Liz was the dream mother for Jill. She always could handle Jill." [...] During an interview with On-Air On-Soaps speaking about how her character has been thrown in different directions, Walton said: [...] "It used to bother me. I would try and keep a steady course with it, and now I can’t. Now I just roll with the punches. It’s impossible." [...] Walton noted that Jill was finally {{happy to have a}} blood relative through Neil's other daughter, Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman). She said: [...] "Liz dies within a week {{and all of a sudden}} it’s, 'I am a Fenmore'. And we really didn’t have a chance to explore it much, but in real life that happens. <b>My</b> <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> as Jill is, 'I actually know who my blood is, and I have a sister.' And, Jill was very moved and touched and shocked from the death of Liz, but full of love for her sister." [...] On her relationship with Lauren, Walton stated that, [...] "Most people don’t like Jill, and she hasn’t particularly loved Lauren. I have never had that much to do with Lauren, really." [...] Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it noted: [...] "The redhead told Jill in no uncertain terms that she intended to keep her father’s memory, and only child status, firmly in tact [...] and had no interest in a close relationship." [...] Borden also noted that Jill always wanted a sense of belonging, which prompted her to legally change her name to Jill Fenmore. The sisters were initially bitter towards each other having to share half of the Fenmore Boutique, but have since gotten closer. Walton said that, [...] "From my point of view, I think that Lauren has a really big heart; she's a naturally lovely person. Lauren was really awful a few times, and that just came out of her pain. So, it looks like Lauren and Jill are kind of getting along okay, but there's nothing else coming up in the scripts for them yet." ...|$|E

But when I considered, I saw that the Pakeha had in the first instance been very much to blame; and I determined to come down and inquire into all the circumstances and see who was really in the wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clarke {{related the}} {{experience}} of Donna Tagliaferri, who described [...] "a terrifying incident after meeting Cosby in the mid-1970s through tennis" [...] {{when she was in}} her early 20s. After playing tennis with Cosby a number of times, he invited her on a dinner date and then invited her up to his hotel room. Tagliaferri had a girlfriend accompany them. After showing them around the penthouse, [...] "things changed dramatically and quickly. He made it clear to me in a very aggressive way what his intentions were. He chillingly said to me, 'I will have you.' Those words are imprinted on my brain along with the evil I felt. <b>My</b> <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> was, 'No you will not.' Then shock took over, and when words wouldn't come a paralyzing feeling did." [...] At this point her girlfriend started talking and got them out of the situation: [...] "I {{have no way of knowing}} what would have happened if Wendy had not been there. What I do know is his words were an assault to me never to be forgotten. And the betrayal of a friendship was staggering." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{first time}} I {{recognized}} the clouds {{brought by the}} plague-wind as distinct in character was in walking back from Oxford, after a hard day's work, to Abingdon, {{in the early spring}} of 1871: it would take too long to give you any account this evening of the particulars which drew my attention to them; but during the following months I had too frequent opportunities of verifying <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>thoughts</b> of them, and on the first of July in that year wrote the description of them which begins the 'Fors Clavigera' of August, thus:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{unforeseen}} {{and violent}} removal of one {{whom she had}} long watched and distrusted and who had long watched and distrusted her, one for whom she could have had few intervals of kindness, always dreading in him a dangerous and secret enemy, appeared so awful that <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>thoughts</b> were of her.

40|$|Since <b>my</b> <b>first</b> {{days in the}} Cradle Roll Department of Sunday School, {{the merits}} of the bad place against the good place have been impounded upon my mind.

40|$|Abstract. This brief {{review article}} is {{appearing}} in the issue of Statistical Science that marks the 25 th anniversary of the bootstrap.

Key words and phrases: Plug-in principle, bootstrap confidence intervals, objective Bayes, BCA, ABC method. <b>My</b> <b>first</b> <b>thoughts</b> on the bootstrap centered around variance and bias estimation. This was natural enough given the bootstrap’s roots in the jackknife literature, with Quenouille (1949) on bias and Tukey (1958) on variance setting the agenda.

40|$|Faced {{with the}} task of giving a survey of the his-torical {{development}} of the application of tracer ele-ments in the field of biology, <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>thoughts</b> are with that great man, the late Lord Rutherford, the founder of nuclear sciences, to whom we owe directly or indirectly so much of the development in recent decades. Lord Rutherford used to pull the leg of the chemist in the genial and friendly way in which the Cambridge man teases the Oxford man.

When I was first introduced to design-based research, it was the methodological approach being used in a grant-funded research project at the Centre for Computer Supported Learning and Cognition (CoCo Lab) at the University of Sydney, Australia, where we were building an educational virtual world that was based on Harvard’s River City. At the time, most of the literature on design-based research was grounded firmly in the learning sciences and came from leading researchers in the field, such as Barab and Squire’s (2004) seminal text and from research groups such as the Design-Based Research Collective (2003) ...|$|R
