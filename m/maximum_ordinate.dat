50|$|Grazing fire is {{when the}} cone of fire does not exceed 1.8 meters (the average height of a man) above the ground. When each bullet is fired, it will leave {{the barrel of the}} weapon at the axis of bore set from the angle of sight desired to strike the target area. The {{trajectory}} of the round should be constant as well as <b>maximum</b> <b>ordinate.</b> <b>Maximum</b> <b>ordinate</b> is the highest point of the trajectory, which is usually 2/3 the distance to the target from the weapon. Depending on the caliber of the round being fired and the slope of the terrain, as well as the distance to the target, the bullet will maintain a semi-flat trajectory. With 7.62×51mm NATO ammunition, which is most commonly used with, for example, the M240 machine gun, the bullet will reach a distance of 600 meters traveling at 900 meters per second or 2,800 feet per second, before it begins a pronounced downward trajectory to the earth. Any distance beyond that range will be considered plunging fire due to the arc (axis of bore + angle of sight) needed to impact the target area.|$|E

The 24 airfoils belong to four general groups. The first is the standard R. A. F. family in general use by the Army and Navy for propeller design, {{the members of the}} family differing only in thickness. This family is represented by nine members ranging in thickness from 0. 04 to 0. 20 inch. The second group consists of five members of the Clark Y family, the members of the family again differing only in thickness. The third group, comprising six members, is a second R. A. F. Family in which the position of the <b>maximum</b> <b>ordinate</b> is varied. Combined with two members of the first R. A. F. family, this group represents a variation of <b>maximum</b> <b>ordinate</b> position from 30 to 60 percent of the chord in two camber ratios, 0. 08 and 0. 16. The fourth group consists of three geometrical forms, a flat plate, a wedge, and a segment of a right circular cylinder. In addition one section used in the reed metal propeller was included. These measurements form a part of a general program outlined at a Conference on Propeller Research organized by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics and the work was carried out with the financial assistance of the committee (author) ...|$|E

The devices were tested on a small parasol monoplane. Experienced gained in the use of flaps during these tests has indicated the desirability of a flap that can be operated quickly and easily...|$|E

However, in spite of their appeal to the practitioner, their use has been constrained by ignorance about their statistical properties. This paper attempts to oer a comparison among alternative methods via extensive simulation studies. The methods are compared across several performance characteristics most notably bias, variance power and RMSE (root mean square error).

40|$|A botnet {{is a large}} {{network of}} bots that are {{under the control of}} a bot herder. Botnets have become a {{significant}} threat to network communications and applications. Botnets' execution relies on Command and Control (C 2) communication channels traffic, which occur prior to the attack activity itself. Therefore, the detection of C 2 communication channels traffic enables the detection of the members of a botnet before any target is attacked. We study the periodic behavior of C 2 traffic that is caused by the pre-programmed behavior of bots to check for and download updates every T seconds. We use this periodic behavior of the C 2 traffic to detect bots. This involves evaluating the periodogram of traffic in the monitored network. Then applying Walker's large sample test to the <b>maximum</b> <b>ordinate</b> of the periodogram to determine if it is due to a high periodic component in the traffic or not, and, if it is, then it is bot traffic. We apply the test to a TinyP 2 P botnet generated by SLINGbot and show a strong periodic behavior in the bots traffic. We study the effect of the period's length and duty cycle of the C 2 traffic on the test performance and find that it increases with the increase of the duty cycle and/or the decrease of the period length. We analyze the test's performance in the presence of injected random noise traffic and develop a lower and an upper bounds for the test performance. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{certain type}} of chordvise vortlcity tistributlon, {{applicable}} to a thin wing of any sweep In incompressible flow, is combined with the general equation for the dovnvash Induced at any spanwise position on a swept vang by the sparwlse vortxces. By applying the "streamline condition " that there 1 s no veloczty component perpendicular to the wing surface, and integrating over the chord, the equation of a camber line is obtained. The initial vorticlty distribution contains two parameters which {{are related to the}} amount of camber and the chordwise position of the <b>maximum</b> <b>ordinate,</b> and thus define a doubly infinite family of camber lines. Expressions are found for the effect of these camber lines on the zero lift angle, lift distribution and centre of pressure at all spanwxe positions. Simple charts are provided from which may be read the equxvalent incidence and pltchmg. moment at zero lift of any camber line of the family at any spanwse position on a wing of any sweep. A detailed description 1 s given of the method of calculating the loading on a given cambered swept wing. Also, the design of wings incorporating camber and twist to produce required chordvise and spanwise loadings is treated in detail, and it IS shown that at any spanwise position only one particular combination of camber and incidence will give a required chordwise loading. The correct matching of camber and tv&st over the whole wing is thus of fundamental importance. One particular camber line of the series, denoted b 7 m = 0. 5, is found to be exactly that requ$red to eliminate the centre and tip effects on the chordwise loading of swept wings. Brie...|$|E
40|$|Botnets {{are large}} {{networks}} of bots (compromised machines) {{that are under}} the control of a small number of bot masters. They pose a significant threat to Internet’s communications and applications. A botnet relies on command and control (C 2) communications channels traffic between its members for its attack execution. C 2 traffic occurs prior to any attack; hence, the detection of botnet’s C 2 traffic enables the detection of members of the botnet before any real harm happens. We analyze C 2 traffic and find that it exhibits a periodic behavior. This is due to the pre-programmed behavior of bots that check for updates to download them every T seconds. We exploit this periodic behavior to detect C 2 traffic. The detection involves evaluating the periodogram of the monitored traffic. Then applying Walker’s large sample test to the periodogram’s <b>maximum</b> <b>ordinate</b> in order to determine if it is due to a periodic component or not. If the periodogram of the monitored traffic contains a periodic component, then it is highly likely that it is due to a bot’s C 2 traffic. The test looks only at aggregate control plane traffic behavior, which makes it more scalable than techniques that involve deep packet inspection (DPI) or tracking the communication flows of different hosts. We apply the test to two types of botnet, tinyP 2 P and IRC that are generated by SLINGbot. We verify the periodic behavior of their C 2 traffic and compare it to the results we get on real traffic that is obtained from a secured enterprise network. We further study the characteristics of the test in the presence of injected HTTP background traffic and the effect of the duty cycle on the periodic behavior...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{spectral}} analysis in time series is to determine what patterns exist in {{a particular set of}} data. To accomplish this, one often calculates the Fourier periodogram of the data and inspects it for peaks. However, since the periodogram is not a consistent estimate of the true spectral density, peaks can be obscured. Therefore, it is necessary to test for significance of the peaks. One of the most widely used tests for significance of periodicities in the periodogram is Fisher's test. The test statistic for Fisher's test is the quotient of the <b>maximum</b> periodogram <b>ordinate</b> and the sum of all the ordinates. If the test statistic is too large, we reject the null hypothesis that the data are white noise. In this thesis, I develop a test for categorical time series which is an analog of Fisher's test for continuous parameter time series. The test involves finding the Walsh-Fourier periodogram of the data and then calculating the test statistic for Fisher's test. I explain the theory behind Walsh-Fourier analysis and compare the theory to that of Fourier analysis. Asymptotic results for the distribution of Fisher's test for Walsh-Fourier spectra are presented and compared with a simulated distribution. I also perform power studies in order to assess the detection capability of the test. In the presence of multiple peaks, this test tends to loose power. Therefore, I also explore several alternatives to Fisher's test for Walsh-Fourier spectra and apply all of the alternative methods to several real data sets...|$|R
40|$|Data mining {{tools are}} {{generally}} used to extract useful information from large databases. Although {{this is a}} relatively young field, several different techniques {{have been developed to}} handle complex high dimensional data sets, including clustering and classification, density estimation, trend estimation, structural analysis, factor analysis, etc. A collaborative effort among statisticians and computer scientists is important to solve many problems involving huge and complex databases, where the complexity increases if there is temporal and/or spatial dependence between variables. We address the problem of developing spectral domain based tools for mining time series data via a clustering algorithm. Such methods are useful in applications to biomedical, marketing or financial time series. ^ We discuss the problem of comparisons of several multivariate time series via their spectral properties. For two independent multivariate Gaussian stationary time series, such a comparison is made via a likelihood ratio test based on the estimated cross-spectra of the series. A simulation based critical value enables effective comparisons of several such multivariate time series. This is an extension of the <b>maximum</b> periodogram <b>ordinate</b> test developed in the literature to compare two independent univariate stationary time series. Further, a hierarchical clustering algorithm is developed to compare several multivariate time series with quasi-distances obtained via likelihood ratio test statistics derived for pairwise comparisons. ^ For a comparison of several independent categorical stationary time series, the notion of spectral envelope (Stoffer, Tyler and McDougall, 1993) is used to first transform the categorical time series to real-valued time series. A distance metric based on Chernoff divergence (Kakizawa, Shumway and Taniguchi, 1998) is computed from the spectra of two real-valued time series to be compared. These pairwise distances are then used in a hierarchical clustering algorithm. We illustrate this method using three different data sets. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the article was to present possible applications of recession flow curve in a small lowland watershed retention discharge size evaluation. The examined woodland micro catchment area of 0. 52 sq km is located in Puszcza Zielonka in central Wielkopolska. The Hutka catchment is typically woody with high retention abilities. The catchment of the Hutka watercourse is forested in 89 %, the other 11 % is covered by swamps and wasteland. The predominant sites are fresh mixed coniferous forest (BMśw), fresh coniferous forest (Bśw) and alder carr forest (Ol). Landscape in catchment {{is characterized by a}} large number of interior depressions, filled partly with rainwater or peatbogs, with poorly developed natural drainage. The watercourses do not exceed 1 km in length, the mean width is approx. 0. 5 m, while mean depth ranges from 0. 2 to 0. 3 m. During hydrological research conducted in 1997 / 1998 – 1999 / 2000, 35 major (characteristic) raised water stages were observed in Hutka after substantial precipitation. The recession curve dating from 18 – 24 September 2000 has the α and n rates nearest to average. Comparing the model curve and the curve created by observing watercourse flow, one can notice their resemblance and that they have similar ordinate values as well as shape. In the case of other recession curves, the <b>maximum</b> differences of <b>ordinate</b> values are also about 0. 1 – 0. 2 l/s/km 2. The measuured α and n rates do not reveal any regularities. There are no significant statistical Horton model parameter (for recession flow curves) dependencies between α and n and e. g. initial flows (Q o) or the whole period of high water waves (Q p). Consequently, calculated relation between these parameters is only an approximation for the general evaluation of the retention discharge in the catchment area towards retention with flow function...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose: Although {{natural hazards}} cannot be prevented, a better {{understanding}} of the processes and scientific methodologies for their prediction can help mitigate their impact. Torrential floods, as one of the consequential forms of the existing erosion processes in synergy with extremely high precipitation, are the most frequent natural hazard at the regional level, which was confirmed by the catastrophic events in May 2014 when huge territories of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia were flood-struck. The basic input data for the design of protective structures in torrential beds and watershed slopes are the values of the maximal discharge, area sediment yields, and sediment transport. The calculation of these values requires a careful approach in accordance with the characteristics of torrential watersheds, such as the steepness of slopes and beds in torrential watersheds, intensive erosion processes, favorable conditions for fast runoff formation and the transport of huge quantities of sediment. Materials and Methods: The calculations of maximal discharges, area sediment yields, and sediment transport in the experimental watershed of the Čađavica River were based on using two different spatial resolutions of digital elevations models (DEMs) – 20 m resolution DEM, with land use determined from aerial photo images, and the 90 m resolution DEM, with land use determined on the basis of the CORINE database. The computation of maximal discharges was performed by applying a method that combined synthetic unit hydrograph (<b>maximum</b> <b>ordinate</b> of unit runoff qmax) and Soil Conservation Service methodologies (deriving effective rainfall Pe from total precipitation Pb). The computation was performed for AMC III (Antecedent Moisture Conditions III – high content of water in the soil and significantly reduced infiltration capacity). The computations of maximal discharges were done taking into account the regional analysis of lag time, internal daily distribution of precipitation and classification of soil hydrologic groups (for CN – runoff curve number determination). Area sediment yields and the intensity of erosion processes were estimated on the basis of the “Erosion Potential Method”. Results and Conclusions: The selected methodology was performed using different input data related to the DEM resolution. The results were illustrated using cartographic and numerical data. Information on relief conditions is a vital parameter for calculating the elements of the environmental conditions through the elements of maximal discharge, area sediment yields and sediment transport. The higher precision of input data of DEM provides a more precise spatial identification and a quantitative estimation of the endangered sites...|$|E
