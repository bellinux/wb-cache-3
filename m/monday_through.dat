5|$|C-SPAN was {{launched}} on March 19, 1979, {{in time for}} the first televised session made available by the House of Representatives, beginning with a speech by then-Tennessee representative Al Gore. Upon its debut, only 3.5 million homes were wired for C-SPAN, and the network had just three employees. The second C-SPAN channel, C-SPAN2, followed on June 2, 1986 when the U.S. Senate permitted itself to be televised. C-SPAN3, the most recent expansion channel, began full-time operations on January 22, 2001, and shows other public policy and government-related live events on weekdays along with weekend historical programming.

5|$|In 2005 {{the group}} moved to WMQM's Millington-based sister station, AM1380 WLRM, and {{switched}} to a nightly schedule, <b>Monday</b> <b>through</b> Friday. Farley left the program in November of that year. Two years later, Geoff Melton, a former co-host, joined to help set up the show's website and the show entered syndication with Dixie Broadcasting Radio Network. The program went on hiatus on February 15, 2008, because staff members said they needed a break, but returned to the airwaves in June 2008 on WLRM on Saturday nights. One year later, it switched from Republic Broadcasting Network to Liberty News Radio Network. As of August 2009, Bonds and Melton are no longer affiliated with the program. Frith now lives in Nashville, Michigan, but remains {{a part of the}} show's staff. Since WLRM is not audited by Arbitron, the show's ratings are unknown. The show is listener-supported and, according to Edwards, receives more donations from Florida than from any other state.|$|E

A twice-daily route from Ålesund to Trondheim was introduced on 3 March 2013. The Ålesund service was terminated on 13 September 2013, with Krohn stating that they were lacking two to three passengers per flight to break even. The company had a revenue of NOK19 million in 2013. Krohn Air ceased all operations on 4 February 2014, and filed for bankruptcy the following day. Widerøe commenced flights on the Molde–Trondheim route from 1 September 2014.|$|E

5|$|Along Line 2, {{the station}} is located between the Jinke Road station and the Tangzhen station.

The train operates from 5:30 to 22:45 westbound and from 6:30 to 21:00 eastbound.

5|$|Some sections, such as Metro, {{are only}} {{found in the}} editions of the paper {{distributed}} in the New York–New Jersey–Connecticut Tri-state area {{and not in the}} national or Washington, D.C. editions. Aside from a weekly roundup of reprints of editorial cartoons from other newspapers, The New York Times does not have its own staff editorial cartoonist, nor does it feature a comics page or Sunday comics section. In September 2008, The New York Times announced that it would be combining certain sections effective October 6, 2008, in editions printed in the New York metropolitan area. The changes folded the Metro Section into the main International / National news section and combined Sports and Business (except Saturday through Monday, when Sports is still printed as a standalone section). This change also included having the name of the Metro section be called New York outside of the Tri-State Area. The presses used by The New York Times allow four sections to be printed simultaneously; as the paper had included more than four sections all days except Saturday, the sections had to be printed separately in an early press run and collated together. The changes will allow The New York Times to print in four sections <b>Monday</b> <b>through</b> Wednesday, in addition to Saturday. The New York Times announcement stated that the number of news pages and employee positions will remain unchanged, with the paper realizing cost savings by cutting overtime expenses.|$|E
