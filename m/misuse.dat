5|$|Alcohol has a {{long history}} of use and <b>misuse</b> {{throughout}} recorded history. Biblical, Egyptian and Babylonian sources record the history of abuse and dependence on alcohol. In some ancient cultures alcohol was worshiped and in others, its abuse was condemned. Excessive alcohol <b>misuse</b> and drunkenness were recognized as causing social problems even thousands of years ago. However, the defining of habitual drunkenness as it was then known as and its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century. In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic alcohol <b>misuse</b> was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures, paralysis, and internal bleeding. In 1920 the effects of alcohol abuse and chronic drunkenness led to the failed prohibition of alcohol being considered and eventually enforced briefly in America. In 2005 alcohol dependence and abuse was estimated to cost the US economy approximately 220 billion dollars per year, more than cancer and obesity.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a systematic analysis}} of insider attacks against mobile ad-hoc routing protocols, using the Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol as an example. It identifies a number of attack goals and then study how to achieve these goals through <b>misuses</b> of the routing messages. To facilitate the analysis, this paper classifies the insider attacks into two categories: atomic <b>misuses</b> and compound <b>misuses.</b> Atomic <b>misuses</b> are performed by manipulating a single routing message, which cannot be further divided; compound <b>misuses</b> are composed of combinations of atomic <b>misuses</b> and possibly normal uses of the routing protocol. The analysis results in this paper reveal several classes of insider attacks, including route disruption, route invasion, node isolation, and resource consumption. This paper also includes simulation results that demonstrate {{the impact of these}} attacks. ...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, {{researchers}} proposed a multitude of automated bug-detection approaches that mine a class of bugs that we call API <b>misuses.</b> Evaluations {{on a variety of}} software products show both the omnipresence of such <b>misuses</b> and the ability of the approaches to detect them. This work presents MuBench, a dataset of 89 API <b>misuses</b> that we collected from 33 real-world projects and a survey. With the dataset we empirically analyze the prevalence of API <b>misuses</b> compared to other types of bugs, finding that they are rare, but almost always cause crashes. Furthermore, we discuss how to use it to benchmark and compare API-misuse detectors...|$|R
5|$|Alprazolam {{was first}} {{released}} by Upjohn (now {{a part of}} Pfizer) in 1981. The first approved use was of panic disorder, and within two years of its original marketing, Xanax became a blockbuster drug in the US. As of 2010, alprazolam is the most prescribed and the most misused benzodiazepine in the US. The potential for <b>misuse</b> among those taking it for medical reasons is controversial, with some expert reviews stating that the risk is low and {{similar to that of}} other benzodiazepine drugs. Others state that there is a substantial risk of <b>misuse</b> and dependence in both patients and non-medical users and that the high affinity binding, high potency, short elimination half-life, and rapid onset of action may increase the <b>misuse</b> potential of alprazolam. Compared to the large number of prescriptions, relatively few individuals increase their dose on their own initiative or engage in drug-seeking behavior. Alprazolam is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).|$|E

5|$|Long-term <b>misuse</b> {{of alcohol}} {{can cause a}} wide range of mental health problems. Severe {{cognitive}} problems are common; approximately 10 percent of all dementia cases are related to alcohol consumption, making it the second leading cause of dementia. Excessive alcohol use causes damage to brain function, and psychological health can be increasingly affected over time. Social skills are significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. The social skills that are impaired by alcohol abuse include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, prosody perception problems and theory of mind deficits; the ability to understand humour is also impaired in alcohol abusers. Psychiatric disorders are common in alcoholics, with as many as 25 percent suffering severe psychiatric disturbances. The most prevalent psychiatric symptoms are anxiety and depression disorders. Psychiatric symptoms usually initially worsen during alcohol withdrawal, but typically improve or disappear with continued abstinence. Psychosis, confusion, and organic brain syndrome may be caused by alcohol <b>misuse,</b> which can lead to a misdiagnosis such as schizophrenia. Panic disorder can develop or worsen {{as a direct result of}} long-term alcohol <b>misuse.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The i * {{framework}} {{has been}} increasingly {{used by the}} requirements engineering community. However, good practices are not always followed. Many papers have presented the use of i * constructs in such ways that results are not coherent with their original specifications. Some cases attempt to adapt the framework to specific needs by <b>misusing</b> its elements. In other situations, <b>misuses</b> are due to wrong interpretations of i * syntax and semantic. Unfortunately, many of these <b>misuses</b> may lead to wrong interpretations of the models by other people using i*. This work carried out a survey on several published papers to collect both good practices and <b>misuses</b> of the framework. It aims to help requirements engineers to use the i * framework in its full capacity. 1...|$|R
