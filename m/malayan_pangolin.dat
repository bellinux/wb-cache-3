50|$|Little {{is known}} of the diet of clouded leopards. Their prey {{includes}} both arboreal and terrestrial vertebrates. Pocock presumed they are adapted for preying upon herbivorous mammals of considerable bulk because of their powerful build and the deep penetration of their bites, attested by their long canines. Confirmed prey species include hog deer, slow loris, brush-tailed porcupine, <b>Malayan</b> <b>pangolin</b> and Indochinese ground squirrel. Known prey species in China include barking deer and pheasants.|$|E
50|$|The {{crab-eating macaque}} (Macaca fascicularis), {{a species of}} monkey, is common in the reserve. The monkeys also enter the area {{surrounding}} the park and are common enough that there are concerns that interactions with people will alter their behaviour. Feeding the monkeys is prohibited, and visitors are urged to avoid staring at, baring teeth at or otherwise disturbing or threatening the monkeys. Monkeys {{are not the only}} mammals in the park. Other mammals include the <b>Malayan</b> <b>pangolin</b> (Manis javanica), Malayan colugo (Galeopterus variegatus), plantain squirrel (Callosciurus notatus) and slender squirrel (Sundasciurus tenuis). The colugos, which are generally nocturnal, can sometimes be seen clinging to trees during the day. Bukit Timah is the only place in Singapore where the red-cheeked flying squirrel (Hylopetes spadiceus) is found.|$|E
50|$|The {{catchment}} {{forests are}} habitats for avian {{species such as}} crested bulbul, Chinese bulbul, hwamei, Oriental magpie robin, Chinese francolin, Japanese quail, common kingfisher, European magpie, crested myna and crows. Also dwelling in woodlands are mammals like <b>Malayan</b> porcupine, Chinese <b>pangolin,</b> masked palm civet, leopard cat and common muntjac.|$|R
40|$|Thirty-four {{polymorphic}} dinucleotide microsatellite loci {{were developed}} in the <b>Malayan</b> <b>pangolin</b> Manis javanica. Of the 34 markers, 32 and 18 were also amplified, respectively, in the Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla) and the African tree pangolin (Manis tricuspis). Analysis of 24 Malayan, 12 Chinese and 2 African tree pangolins showed high levels of variability (heterozygosity ranging from 0. 321 to 0. 708). These are the first available microsatellite markers in Pholidota and will be an invaluable tool for evolutionary and conservation genetic studies in pangolins...|$|E
40|$|Amelogenesis imperfecta is a {{group of}} {{disorders}} causing abnormalities in enamel formation in various phenotypes. Many mutations in the FAM 83 H gene have been identified to result in autosomal dominant hypocalcified amelogenesis imperfecta in different populations. However, the structure and function of FAM 83 H and its pathological mechanism have yet to be further explored. Evolutionary analysis is an alternative for revealing residues or motifs that are important for protein function. In the present study, we chose 50 vertebrate species in public databases representative of approximately 230 million years of evolution, including 1 amphibian, 2 fishes, 7 sauropsidas and 40 mammals, and we performed evolutionary analysis on the FAM 83 H protein. By sequence alignment, conserved residues and motifs were indicated, and the loss of important residues and motifs of five special species (<b>Malayan</b> <b>pangolin,</b> platypus, minke whale, nine-banded armadillo and aardvark) was discovered. A phylogenetic time tree showed the FAM 83 H divergent process. Positive selection sites in the C-terminus suggested that the C-terminus of FAM 83 H played certain adaptive roles during evolution. The results confirmed some important motifs reported in previous findings and identified some new highly conserved residues and motifs that need further investigation. The results suggest that the C-terminus of FAM 83 H contain key conserved regions critical to enamel formation and calcification...|$|E
40|$|International audienceUsing immunohistochemistry, {{the study}} {{demonstrates}} substances of the innate immunity {{in the skin}} of the <b>Malayan</b> <b>pangolin</b> (), referring mainly to the epidermis. The results obtained showed clear reaction differences between the dorsolateral body region with its strong cover of hard horny scales and the abdominal body part with a thick soft stratum corneum and a dense cover of fine hairs. Regarding pathogen recognition receptors, positive reactions for Toll-like receptors were generally weak for TLR 2, in contrast to TLR 4, that exhibited strong reactions in the epidermis of both body regions, with increasing staining intensities towards the stratum corneum; ß-glucan receptors showed positive reactions only for -ficolin and mannose-binding lectin, but not for dectin- 1, and only at the abdomen. A generally positive staining for both body regions was obtained for all cationic antimicrobial peptides tested, whereby cathelicidin exhibited strong reaction intensities in all epidermal layers, ß-defensin 2 staining was often limited to the stratum basale and the stratum spinosum, and positive reactions for ß-defensin 3 appeared distinctly only in the epidermis of the abdomen; for these peptides, positive reaction staining could also be found in the outer epithelial root sheath of hair follicles, their glandular annexes, and free cells of the dermis. Lysozyme was found in the vital epidermis of both body regions studied, with strong staining limited to the dorsum; strong reactions were also visible in the hair follicles...|$|E
40|$|Using immunohistochemistry, {{the study}} {{demonstrates}} {{the distribution of}} keratins (pan-keratin with CK 1 - 8, 10, 14 - 16, 19; keratins CK 1, 5, 6, 9, 10; hair keratins AE 13, AE 14) in the epidermis of the <b>Malayan</b> <b>pangolin</b> (Manis javanica). A varying reaction spectrum was observed for pan-keratin, with body region-dependent negative to very strong reaction intensities. The dorsolateral epidermis exhibited positive reactions only in its vital layers, whereas the abdominal epidermis showed strong positive reactions in the soft two outer strata. The single acidic and basic-to-neutral (cyto) keratins produced clear variations compared to the pan-keratin tinging. E. g., CK 1 appeared in all epidermal layers of both body regions, except for the ventral stratum corneum, whereas CK 5, 6, 9, 10 were restricted to the soft ventral epidermis. Here, distinctly positive reactions were confined to the stratum granulosum, except for CK 6 {{that appeared in the}} soft stratum corneum. A different staining pattern was obvious for the hair keratins, i. e., positive reactions of AE 13 concentrated only in the granular layer of the dorsal epidermis. In the abdominal epidermis, remarkable tinging for AE 14 was visible in the stratum basale, decreasing toward the corneal layer, but was also found in the outer root sheath cells of the hair follicles in the ventral body part. Our findings are discussed related to the evolution of the horny dorsal scales of the pangolin, which may have started from the tail root, projecting forward to the hea...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Malayan</b> <b>pangolin</b> (Manis javanica) is an unusual, scale-covered, toothless mammal {{that specializes}} in myrmecophagy. Due to their {{threatened}} status and continuing decline in the wild, concerted efforts {{have been made to}} conserve and rescue this species in captivity in China. Maintaining this species in captivity is a significant challenge, partly because little is known of the molecular mechanisms of its digestive system. Here, the first large-scale sequencing analyses of the salivary gland, liver and small intestine transcriptomes of an adult M. javanica genome were performed, and the results were compared with published liver transcriptome profiles for a pregnant M. javanica female. A total of 24, 452 transcripts were obtained, among which 22, 538 were annotated on the basis of seven databases. In addition, 3, 373 new genes were predicted, of which 1, 459 were annotated. Several pathways were found to be involved in myrmecophagy, including olfactory transduction, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, lipid metabolism, and terpenoid and polyketide metabolism pathways. Many of the annotated transcripts were involved in digestive functions: 997 transcripts were related to sensory perception, 129 were related to digestive enzyme gene families, and 199 were related to molecular transporters. One transcript for an acidic mammalian chitinase was found in the annotated data, and this might be closely related to the unique digestive function of pangolins. These pathways and transcripts are involved in specialization processes related to myrmecophagy (a form of insectivory) and carbohydrate, protein and lipid digestive pathways, probably reflecting adaptations to myrmecophagy. Our study is the first to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying myrmecophagy in M. javanica, and we hope that our results {{may play a role in}} the conservation of this species...|$|E
40|$|The Thung Yai Naresuan (East) Wildlife {{sanctuary}} (TYNE) is clarified as the Tiger Conservation Landscape of Global Priority {{and also}} a stronghold for other endangered and threaten species. Although, UNESCO designated this area, the cores of the Western Forest Complex (WEFCOM), as a Natural World Heritage Site in 1991, this wildlife has been threatened by habitat alteration, prey depletion, and direct killing. Yet, the information on impact of human activities and wildlife status {{that is needed to}} guild forest authorities to develop conservation strategies remains challenging. The goal of this dissertation was to increase understanding of tiger, other main predators, prey status, and also impact of human activities in the sanctuary. In the TYNE, the globally endangered species were observed including Asiatic Elephant (Elephas maximus), Tiger (Panthera tigris), Malayan Tapir (Tapirus indicus), Dhole (Cuon alpines), and <b>Malayan</b> <b>Pangolin</b> (Manis javanica). Spatially explicit capture-recapture approach estimated tiger density at 1. 4 - 1. 6 tigers/ 100 km 2 and leopard density at 0. 7 - 0. 8 leopards/ 100 km 2, which indicates that there might be 27 ± 10 tigers (95 % CL range from 11 - 46) and around 12 ± 4 leopards (95 % CL range from 8 - 19) roaming in the area around 1, 596 km 2 in TYNE. The large predators like tigers, leopards, and dholes co-occurred in the area with the combination of both spatial and temporal partitioning due to differences in predator and prey activity and low overlap in space use correlated to their prey preferences. Prey availability, human settlement areas, and human disturbance activities are the key limiting factors for their distribution and space-use. The habitat use of tiger and leopard demonstrated that the population distribution was limited in the central to {{the eastern part of the}} TYNE, while the local people occupied the west with high disturbance activities. The activities by local people in TYNE were varied and the impacts of the disturbance were complex. Slash and burn, livestock, tree cutting, and poaching appeared to be the major influence wildlife abundance and habitat around the settlement areas. The results of this study stress the need for the further conservation and management to maintain wildlife distribution and populations in the future. Better scientific understanding of wildlife biology, ecology, and social sciences would help to deal with the conservation and management issues facing the local communities and natural resources in Thung Yai Naresuan (East) Wildlife Sanctuary. ...|$|E
