5|$|Fish {{caught off}} the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador are {{required}} to have a minimal level of processing done in provincial fish plants. The objective is to ensure that the province’s fishery generates the maximum economic and employment benefits for the province.These requirements are known as minimum processing requirements, or MPRs. These requirements have been an issue in province over the years for numerous reasons including; the cost of processing, labour availability and because some <b>markets</b> <b>are</b> interested in less processed fish. The Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture can grant a company exemptions from minimum processing requirements.|$|E

5|$|New Keynesians offered {{explanations}} {{for the failure of}} the labor market to clear. In a Walrasian market, unemployed workers bid down wages until the demand for workers meets the supply. If <b>markets</b> <b>are</b> Walrasian, the ranks of the unemployed would be limited to workers transitioning between jobs and workers who choose not to work because wages are too low to attract them. They developed several theories explaining why markets might leave willing workers unemployed. Of these theories, new Keynesians were especially associated with efficiency wages and the insider-outsider model used to explain long-term effects of previous unemployment, where short-term increases in unemployment become permanent and lead to higher levels of unemployment in the long-run.|$|E
5|$|Night market: The {{concept of}} the night market traces its roots back to the medieval Chinese Tang dynasty. The Tang {{government}} put strict sanctions on night markets and their operations in A.D. 836. Towards {{the end of the}} Tang Dynasty, economic expansion led to less state regulation and restrictions being lifted on night markets. During the Song Dynasty (960-1279), Night markets {{played a central role in}} medieval Chinese nightlife. These markets were found in corners of large cities. Some stayed open for twenty- four hours. Song period night <b>markets</b> <b>are</b> also known to have included restaurants and brothels due to being frequently located near business and red light districts.|$|E

In California the leading regional <b>markets</b> <b>are</b> San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego, all metropolitan areas notorious for their high congestion levels and where free access to high-occupancy lanes for solo drivers has been a strong incentive to boost Volt sales in the state.|$|E

5|$|Hong Kong is the world's {{eleventh}} largest trading entity, {{with the}} total value of imports and exports exceeding its gross domestic product. It is the world's largest re-export centre. Much of Hong Kong's exports consist of re-exports, which are products made outside of the territory, especially in mainland China, and distributed via Hong Kong. Its physical location has allowed the city to establish a transportation and logistics infrastructure that includes the world's second busiest container port and the world's busiest airport for international cargo. Even before the transfer of sovereignty, Hong Kong had established extensive trade and investment ties with the mainland, which now enable it to serve as a point of entry for investment flowing into the mainland. At the end of 2007, there were 3.46million people employed full-time, with the unemployment rate averaging 4.1% for the fourth straight year of decline. Hong Kong's economy is dominated by the service sector, which accounts for over 90% of its GDP, while industry constitutes 9%. Inflation was at 2.5% in 2007. Hong Kong's largest export <b>markets</b> <b>are</b> mainland China, the United States, and Japan.|$|E
5|$|In {{standard}} {{models of}} international trade a fall {{in the price of}} a country's export good – a deterioration in its terms of trade – generally decreases the home country's welfare. In the Brander–Spencer model however the opposite is true. This is because in this model the <b>markets</b> <b>are</b> not perfectly competitive and the revenue from the expanded quantity sold compensates the firm for the revenue lost from the lower export price. If the good produced by the firm is also consumed domestically however the result is a bit more complicated. In the case where the firm is able to separate the home and export market (charge different prices in each with no possibility of third party arbitrage) then the level of the optimal subsidies will depend on whether marginal costs of production are constant, increasing or decreasing. The optimal subsidy level is either the same, higher or lower, respectively, compared to the level with no domestic consumption. This underscores the need {{on the part of the}} government for very precise information on industry structure and firm's cost functions.|$|E
5|$|International trade usually {{results in}} a high {{mortality}} rate during transit, between 30% and 90%. Slow lorises also experience many health problems {{as a result of}} both local and international trade. To give the impression that the primates are tame and appropriate pets for children, to protect people from their potentially toxic bite, or to deceive buyers into thinking the animal is a baby, animal dealers either pull the front teeth with pliers or wire cutters or they cut them off with nail cutters. This results in severe bleeding, which sometimes causes shock or death, and frequently leads to dental infection, which is fatal in 90% of all cases. Without their teeth, the animals are no longer able to fend for themselves in the wild, and must remain in captivity for life. The slow lorises found in animal <b>markets</b> <b>are</b> usually underweight and malnourished, and have had their fur dyed, which complicates species identification at rescue centers. As many as 95% of the slow lorises rescued from the markets die of dental infection or improper care.|$|E
