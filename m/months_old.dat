40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of malnutrition in Indonesia is still high. One of potential {{factor contributing to}} the high {{prevalence of}} malnutrition is improper complementary feeding pattern and breast feeding practices. In the community there are three complementary feeding patterns; those are traditional feeding, industries feeding and combination. Objective: This {{study was conducted to}} analyze the association between complementary feeding, energy and protein intake, and breast feeding status with nutritional status of infants 0 - 12 <b>month</b> <b>old.</b> Method: This study used a cross sectional design. Subjects were 151 infants 0 - 12 <b>month</b> <b>old.</b> Complementary feeding pattern and breast feeding status were collected using interview methods. Energy and protein intakes were collected using food recall methods. Nutritional status was measured using weight for length (WHZ). The chi square test was used to analyze the data. Result: There wasn’t any association between complementary feeding pattern and nutritional status of infants 0 - 6 m. o. old (p= 0. 04) and 6 - 12 month (p= 0. 62). There wasn’t any association between energy intake and nutritional status of infants 0 - 6 <b>month</b> <b>old</b> (p= 0. 40), but there was any association in infants 6 - 12 <b>month</b> <b>old</b> (p= 0. 01). Protein intake associated with nutritional status of infants 0 - 6 m. o. old and 6 - 12 <b>month</b> <b>old</b> (p= 0. 033 and p= 0. 04). Breast feeding status didn’t associated with nutritional status of infants 0 - 6 <b>month</b> <b>old</b> and 6 - 12 <b>month</b> <b>old</b> (p= 0. 689 and p= 0. 10). Conclusion: Complementary pattern and breast feeding status were not associated with nutritional status. Energy intake was associated with nutritional status of infants 6 - 12 <b>month</b> <b>old.</b> Protein intake associated with nutritional status of infants 0 - 6 <b>month</b> <b>old</b> and 6 - 12 <b>month</b> <b>old...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{separate}} experiments, nine (n= 20) {{and fifteen}} (n= 12) <b>month</b> <b>old</b> rats {{were treated with}} either 6 % ethanol or 12 % sucrose (to balance caloric intake) in the drinking water to {{examine the effect of}} chronic ethanol consumption on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis of aged rats. Rats were maintained on these treatment regimens for thirty days and were killed by decapitation. Blood was collected and plasma concentrations of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and corticosterone were determined by radioimmunoassay. Adrenal glands were cleaned, quartered and used to test in vitro responsiveness to ACTH. Anterior pituitary glands from all 15 <b>month</b> <b>old</b> rats and one half of the nine <b>month</b> <b>old</b> rats were collected, frozen and extracted for measurement of tissue ACTH concentration. The remaining anterior pituitary glands from the nine <b>month</b> <b>old</b> rats were challenged with corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) to test in vitro responsiveness. In nine <b>month</b> <b>old</b> rats, chronic ethanol consumption decreased plasma ACTH and corticosterone (P In vitro responsiveness of the adrenal gland to ACTH in nine <b>month</b> <b>old</b> rats consuming ethanol was unchanged (P > 0. 05).

40|$|Mutations in {{the gene}} for polycystin 2 (Pkd 2) lead to polycystic kidney disease, however {{the main cause of}} {{mortality}} in humans is cardiac related. We previously showed that 5 <b>month</b> <b>old</b> Pkd 2 +/- mice have altered calcium-contractile activity in cardiomyocytes, but have preserved cardiac function. Here, we examined 1 and 9 <b>month</b> <b>old</b> Pkd 2 +/- mice to determine if decreased amounts of functional polycystin 2 leads to impaired cardiac function with aging. We observed changes in calcium handling proteins in 1 <b>month</b> <b>old</b> Pkd 2 +/- mice, and these changes were exacerbated in 9 <b>month</b> <b>old</b> Pkd 2 +/- mice. Anatomically, the 9 <b>month</b> <b>old</b> Pkd 2 +/- mice had thinner left ventricular walls, consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy, and the left ventricular ejection fraction was decreased. Intriguingly, in response to acute isoproterenol stimulation to examine β-adrenergic responses, the 9 <b>month</b> <b>old</b> Pkd 2 +/- mice exhibited a stronger contractile response, which also coincided with preserved localization of the β 2 adrenergic receptor. Importantly, the Pkd 2 +/- mice did not have any renal impairment. We conclude that the cardiac-related impact of decreased polycystin 2 progresses over time towards cardiac dysfunction and altered adrenergic signaling. These results provide further evidence that polycystin 2 provides a critical function in the heart, independent of renal involvement...|$|R

This {{condition}} is most often observed when a puppy is 4 to 6 <b>months</b> <b>old.</b> In the most serious cases, surgery may be indicated.

The grades 3–4 are most severe where surgery will most likely be needed to correct the problem to avoid the development of arthritis and lameness in the limb.|$|E
