40|$|Lot {{numbers are}} marks that {{are applied to}} {{ammunition}} {{at the point of}} manu-facture, assembly, or modification. They identify a quantity of ammunition that has been assembled from uniform components and under similar condi-tions. These marks are applied to facilitate accounting and general manage-ment <b>of</b> ammunition. <b>Marks</b> may be applied on ammunition components themselves and/or on the packaging of the ammunition. Small arms ammunition is rarely lot marked on the ammunition itself, such as on the cartridge case. This chapter argues that applying lot marks di-rectly to small arms cartridges offers some security forces the prospect of in-creased logistical efficiency. In addition, lot <b>marking</b> <b>of</b> small <b>arms</b> ammuni-tion has proved to be an effective way of discouraging and detecting diversion from national stockpiles...|$|R
