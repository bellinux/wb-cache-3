5000|$|An ancient synagogue {{uncovered}} in 2011 is notable for its fine limestone carvings {{and for a}} mosaic of the Biblical hero Samson. According to archaeologist Jodi Magness, [...] "This discovery is significant because {{only a small number}} of ancient (Late Roman) synagogue buildings are decorated with mosaics showing biblical scenes, and only two others have scenes with Samson (one is at another site just a couple of miles from Huqoq)" [...] Furthermore, [...] "Our mosaics are also important because of their high artistic quality and the tiny size of the <b>mosaic</b> <b>cubes.</b> This, together with the monumental size of the stones used to construct the synagogue's walls, suggest a high level of prosperity in this village, as the building clearly was very costly." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Roman period {{village was}} large and prosperous due to the {{presence}} of a constant spring. Archaeologist Jodi Magness told Science News that the [...] "high artistic quality and the tiny size of the <b>mosaic</b> <b>cubes,...</b> together with the monumental size of the stones used to construct the synagogue’s walls, suggest a high level of prosperity in this village, as the building clearly was very costly.” [...] The prosperity of the ancient village contrasts with the simplicity of the Ottoman era settlement and can be seen by archaeologists in animal bones which were cut by professional butchers in the ancient Jewish village, and by farmers in the Muslim period. [...] It is apparent from both the synagogue and the absence of pork bones that the Roman period village was Jewish.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Object: The aim of {{the paper}} is to present some {{concepts}} able {{to be used in}} high education teaching based on different pedagogical methodologies. A profound teaching process that combines e-learning and alternative learning elements will promote security in real life. A multi-agent case study based on observation for OOP was developed for e-learning direction. As alternative elements for education different methods were considered as: Brainstorming, Think/Pair work/Communication, I Know/I want to know/I learned, Clustering, <b>Mosaic,</b> <b>Cube,</b> etc. The Enneagram principle was experimented to compose practical and research teams depending on compatibility personalities. Methods and Results: During the study were developed some dedicated practical applications with students. In a second stage considering the enneagram model for creating working teams in specific groups, it is possible to better understand the learning evolution of students. The connection between the technical teaching and the spiritual evolution of participants was also considered...|$|R

60|$|In the library, {{protected}} against the predatory enthusiasm of visitors by a heavy wire netting, are {{the desk and}} chair of Petrarch, which I know of no form of words to describe perfectly. The front of the desk is {{of a kind of}} <b>mosaic</b> in <b>cubes</b> of wood, most of which have been carried away. The chair is wide-armed and carved, but the bottom is gone, and it has been rudely repaired. The custodian said Petrarch died in this chair while he sat writing at his desk in the little nook lighted by a single window opening on the left from his library. He loved to sit there. As I entered I found he had stepped out for a moment, but I know he returned directly after I withdrew.|$|R
40|$|Systematical archaeological {{excavations}} at {{the site}} Gamzigrad - Felix Romuliana continued in 2007 - 2008 in the south-eastern part of the fortified imperial palace, in {{the section of the}} thermae according to the plan of archaeological research for this site (2005 - 2009). In 2007, squares L'XXIV, M'XXIV, M'XXIH and M'XXII, which were investigated in 2005 to the horizon c, dated {{to the end of the}} 5 th and the beginning of the 6 th centuries, were completely excavated to the level of the porch of the earlier fortification of Romuliana (Plan 1). The stratigraphy of the cultural layers in these squares is as follows (Fig. 1) : Below horizon c there is a layer of construction rubble mixed with brownish-yellow, clay like, sandy soil, 50 - 75 cm thick, comprising the finds dated in the last quarter of the 4 th- 5 th centuries, layer D; The level of layer D is horizon d, where a structure destroyed in a conflagration, house 1 / 07, was discovered in squares M'XXII and M'XXIII. It could be dated, on the basis of the preserved household (pottery, metal and antler items, coins, etc.), from the last quarter of the 4 th to the middle of the 5 th century; Horizon d 1 is a mortar floor discovered beneath horizon d, which presents the earlier phase of house 1 / 07; Horizon d 2 is the earliest mortar floor inside the house 1 / 07, covered with a later mortar floor (horizon d 1) and a levelling layer of yellow sand and gravel, which comprises the finds dating also to the last quarter of the 4 th to the middle of the 5 th centuries; Layer E, 15 - 40 cm thick, is below horizon d, comprising dark brown soil with rubble and lenses of soot at the bottom, together with finds dated to the second half of the 4 th century; Horizon e is covered with layer E, and spread across all the squares which were investigated to the south and to the east of Galerius' bath, where 8 large postholes, which outlined a space 7 x 3 m large and probably some kind of porch, were found along with two furnaces and two pits; Layer F, about 30 cm thick, is the substructure of horizon e and it comprises crushed stone and pebbles mixed with lime mortar, and in places has a levelling of reddish-brown sand. Finds here were dated to the end of the 3 rd and the first half of the 4 th centuries; Horizon f is a mortar floor of the later fortification of Felix Romuliana at a level of 184. 75 m in the west and 184. 55 m in the east (an average level of 184. 64 m), which was interrupted by a trench running in an east-west direction along the southern section of squares L'-M'XXIV. The trench was filled with soot, small rubble and reddish-brown sand and comprised a large amount of artifacts, such as pottery and glass fragments, metal and bone items and coins dated to the second half of the 3 rd century (Fig. 4). Layer G consists of dark brown and yellowish-brown clay with small rubble and soot. It was a levelling layer above the intense construction rubble from the previous horizon and a substructure of horizon f. This layer comprised archaeological finds dated to the end of the 3 rd and the first half of the 4 th centuries and to the prehistoric period (Early Iron Age); Horizon g is a mortar floor of the porch of the southern and eastern rampart of the earlier fortification of Romuliana. 4 pillars of the eastern porch (pillars 1 - 4, discovered in 2004 - 2005), a corner pillar in an L-shape (pillar 5) and one pillar of the southern porch (pillar 6) have been ascertained. From this level the water and sewage canals were dug (Fig. 5). In squares K'XXII-XXIII a trench, measuring 4 x 2 m, in an east-west direction, was opened which aimed to investigate the layers beneath the Roman horizon g. The stratigraphy in this trench is as follows: - Layer G at a level of about 184. 53 m; - Layer H, about 35 cm thick, is greenish-yellow clay in which Roman canals were buried, comprising the fragments of the Early and Late Iron Age pottery and fragments of reddish rammed earth (Fig. 2); Layer I, about 20 cm thick, is greenish-brown clay, comprising the scarce fragments of the Early and Late Iron Age pottery; Virgin soil consists of yellow clay starting from a level of 184. 00 m in the west and of 183. 60 m in the east. In 2008, the remains of an earlier building were discovered beneath the floor of the apodyterium of Galerius' bath found in 2002 and below the foundation of the sudatorium and the tepidarium of the same structure, which were found in 2005. Also, for the purposes of conservation and restoration of the thermae, an apsidal room next to the west wall of the apodyterium, so called 'Galerius' dressing room', was completely filled with construction rubble, among which was found a part of an abraded vault (Fig. 6). Excavations proved that the apsidal room had been a pool with cold water, a frigidarium, which was twice renovated and was decorated with mosaic made of black, white and grey stone cubes (Fig. 7). The phases of reconstruction of the frigidarium could also be noticed in its eastern wall (Fig. 8). Also in the rubble inside the pool, glass <b>mosaic</b> <b>cubes</b> of deep blue and golden colours were discovered, indicating the decoration of the vault. In the latest phase, two pillars were constructed to carry the stairs made of stone slabs (Fig. 8). The earliest phase of this room, which had a rectangular layout and a mortar floor, could be part of the building dating back to before Galerius' bath (Plan 2). During the cleaning of the eastern wall of the frigidarium, a semicircular niche with a fresco decoration of geometrical and figural motives, painted in black, dark red, orange and blue on an ochre surface, was discovered (Fig. 3). Under Galerius' bath, a large earlier building was investigated (trenches 1 - 5 / 08). Only its foundation zone is preserved. The walls of the Imperial bath were founded on the earlier walls, which were 0. 65 m thick and had foundations which were 0. 90 m thick (Plan 2). The pilaster of the west faeade of the thermae was also founded on the earlier wall, but it destroyed a water canal (canal A discovered inside the south room of Galerius' bath in 2004), which was constructed after the earlier structure and before the Imperial bath (Fig. 9). It is interesting that the part of the earlier building to the west of the thermae was not demolished during the construction of the Imperial residence. It was adapted and incorporated into the plan of the fortified palace. The original construction was a large public building, probably theprincipia, with a row of rooms around a large courtyard, the atrium. The entrance, which had a porch and a pylon with two square towers and thresholds made of stone slabs, was in the north. (Figs. 10 - 14) Previously, this building was mistakenly dated to the 4 th- 5 th centuries, because it had been reused in Late Roman and Early Byzantine periods. (Figs. 15 - 18) However, based on the results of the new research, it could be dated to the 3 rd century. ...|$|E

The new object is called hyperbolic Pascal pyramid since the mathematical background goes back to the regular <b>cube</b> <b>mosaic</b> (cubic honeycomb) in the hyperbolic space. The definition of the hyperbolic Pascal pyramid is a natural generalization of the definition of hyperbolic Pascal triangle and Pascal's arithmetic pyramid. We describe the growing of hyperbolic Pascal pyramid considering the numbers and the values of the elements. Further figures illustrate the stepping from a level to the next one.

40|$|We {{describe}} the operations concept and data reduction {{plan for the}} Mid- Infrared Instrument (MIRI) for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The overall JWST operations concept is to use Observation Templates (OTs) to provide a straightforward and intuitive way for users to specify observations. MIRI has four OTs that correspond to the four observing modes: 1.) Imaging, 2.) Coronagraphy, 3.) Low Resolution Spectroscopy, and 4.) Medium Resolution Spectroscopy. We outline the user choices and expansion of these choices into detailed instrument operations. The data reduction plans for MIRI are split into three stages, where the specificity of the reduction steps to the observation type increases with stage. The reduction starts with integration ramps: stage 1 yields uncalibrated slope images; stage 2 calibrates the slope images; and then stage 3 combines multiple calibrated slope images into high level data products (e. g. <b>mosaics,</b> spectral <b>cubes,</b> and extracted source information). Finally, we give examples of the data and data products that will be derived {{from each of the}} four different OTs...|$|R
40|$|Our ongoing {{research}} at Caltech in VLSI architecture and design is entering a phase {{in which we}} are doing experiments with the design, programming, and applications of working concurrent systems of useful size and performance. The three systems to be discussed, cosmic <b>cube,</b> <b>mosaic,</b> and super mesh, are all structured as ensembles of identical elements that operate concurrently sad communicate by message passing. These systems differ in many significant respects: element size, communication plan, MIMD vs SIMD, and consequently in programming style and applications. This paper presents the common principles and issues that have guided these designs, reports preliminary results, and discusses plans for research and system building experiments that we hope and expect will yield significant results over the next several years...|$|R
50|$|On 19 November 2015, three {{students}} of IIM Lucknow attempted Limca Book of Records by creating India's largest Rubik's <b>cube</b> <b>mosaic</b> {{in honour of}} Manjunath Shanmugam, alumnus of IIM Lucknow. Three students of IIM Lucknow, Manish Meshram, Panchu Ghorui and Tanuj Lodhi initiated the idea on Manjunath's 10th death anniversary. They used 23,278 Rubik's cubes to build the mosaic representing Manjunath's birthday (23 February 1978). Over 150 students volunteered for the record attempt. The mosaic was kept for display for three days. The record attempt allowed students to spread the idea of honesty and integrity across the boundaries and inspire young minds. IIM Lucknow's band 3.4 presented inspirational song dedicated to Manjunath, The event was supported by IIM Lucknow's alumni community.|$|R
