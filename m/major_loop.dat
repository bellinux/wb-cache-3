40|$|Simian virus 40 large T antigen {{contains}} a single sequence element with {{an arrangement of}} cysteines and histidines that is characteristic of a zinc finger motif. The finger region maps from amino acids 302 through 320 and has the sequence Cys- 302 LeuLysCys- 305 IleLysLysGluGlnProSerHisTyrLysTyrHis- 317 GluLysHis- 320. In a conventional representation, the binding of zinc to the cysteines and histidines at positions 302, 305, 317, and 320 would form two minor loops and one <b>major</b> <b>loop</b> from the intervening amino acids. We made single amino acid substitutions at every position in the finger to identify possible functional elements within the putative metal-binding domain. Amino acids in the zinc finger could be divided into three classes characterized by distinct roles in DNA replication and transformation. Class 1 consisted of amino acids in the two minor loops of the finger and in the amino-terminal part of the <b>major</b> <b>loop.</b> Mutations here did not affect either replication or transformation. Class 2 consisted of the SerHisTyrLysTyr amino acids located in the carboxy terminus of the <b>major</b> <b>loop</b> of the finger. Mutations in this contiguous region reduced replication of the mutant viruses to different degrees. This clustering suggested that the region is an active site important for a specific function in DNA replication.

Class 3 consisted of the proposed zinc-binding amino acids at positions 302, 305, 317, and 320 and the histidine at position 313 in the <b>major</b> <b>loop</b> of the finger. Mutations in these amino acids abolished the viability of the virus completely and had a distinctive effect on the transforming functions of the protein.

40|$|A {{novel and}} precise {{characterization}} of the constitutive behavior of solid and laminated research-grade, polycrystalline Galfenol (Fe 81 : 6 Ga 18 : 4) under under quasi-static (1 Hz) and dynamic (4 to 1000 Hz) stress loadings was recently conducted by the authors. This paper summarizes the characterization {{by focusing on the}} experimental design and the dynamic sensing response of the solid Galfenol specimen. Mechanical loads are applied using a high frequency load frame. The dynamic stress amplitude for minor and <b>major</b> <b>loops</b> is 2. 88 and 31. 4 MPa, respectively. Dynamic minor and <b>major</b> <b>loops</b> are measured for the bias condition resulting in maximum, quasi-static sensitivity. Three key sources of error in the dynamic measurements are accounted for: (1) electromagnetic noise in strain signals due to Galfenol's magnetic response, (2) error in load signals due to the inertial force of fixturing, and (3) time delays imposed by conditioning electronics. For dynamic characterization, strain error is kept below 1. 2 % of full scale by wiring two collocated gauges in series (noise cancellation) and through lead wire weaving. Inertial force error is kept below 0. 41 % by measuring the dynamic force in the specimen using a nearly collocated piezoelectric load washer. The phase response of all conditioning electronics is explicitly measured and corrected for. In general, as frequency increases, the sensing response becomes more linear due to an increase in eddy currents. The location of positive and negative saturation is the same at all frequencies. As frequency increases above about 100 Hz, the elbow in the strain versus stress response disappears as the active (soft) regime stiffens toward the passive (hard) regime...|$|R
