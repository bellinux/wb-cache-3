40|$|Requirements {{specifications}} for high assurance secure systems are {{rare in the}} open literature. This paper examines {{the development of a}} requirements document for a multilevel secure system that must meet stringent assurance and evaluation requirements. The system is designed to be secure, yet combines popular commercial components with specialized high assurance ones. Functional and non-functional requirements pertinent to security are discussed. A <b>multi-dimensional</b> <b>threat</b> model is presented. The threat model accounts for the developmental and operational phases of system evolution and for each phase accounts for both physical and non-physical threats. We describe our team-based method for developing a requirements document and relate that process to techniques in requirements engineering. The system requirements document presented provides a calibration point for future security requirements engineering techniques intended to meet both functional and assurance goals...|$|E

40|$|Integrity for GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) at {{user level}} is {{monitored}} {{by means of}} RAIM (Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring) algorithms. Most RAIM algorithms are based on detection tests, which are able to detect and identify possible anomalies in the measurements and eventually exclude suspected measurements from the position solution or forward a warning to the pilot. In this paper the two most commonly used tests, the standard Uniformly Most Powerful Invariant (UMPI) test and the Solution Separation (SS) test, are compared and differences are pointed out, both from a general statistical {{point of view and}} a more specifically integrity point of view. The detection regions of the two methods are compared and a numerical example is provided. The results show that the two methods are equivalent in case the anomaly or threat model has only one dimension, whereas differences arise in case of <b>multi-dimensional</b> <b>threats.</b> Geoscience & Remote SensingCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
30|$|Our {{agent-based}} model {{helps to}} investigate two key aspects in particular: it relates spatial distribution in modern Muscat Capital Area to tribal motivations {{that threaten to}} undermine central state efforts of controlled land allocation by lottery and explains, for the first time, the fine-grain motivations of each agent and to demonstrate the emergent phenomena that are congruent with site observation. In conclusion, {{we can say that}} tribal affiliation strongly influences the current land-allocation process in Oman. The model shows that clan-formation has (i) social, (ii) spatial, (iii) economic and (iv) political consequences. The original intent of the land-allocation by lottery (i) in support of a modern nation-building, (ii) sustainable allocation of spatial resources, (iii) egalitarian welfare system and (iv) as consolidator of the political status quo does not completely match. Given these <b>multi-dimensional</b> <b>threats</b> to the original intentions of the land-allocation system by lottery, reforms need to be adopted soon. We see the inclusion of tribal motivations into future governance of land-allocation as key to sustainable urban development in tribal societies like Oman. Such a governance system would embrace tribal spatial mobility and affiliation, create necessary clan-clusters on a micro-scale of neighbourhoods while ensuring a fair and even access of all citizens to urban facilities on the larger municipal and regional level. The present agent-based model can be used to develop such a new governance approach.|$|R

[...] According to Prabhakaran Paleri, author of National Security, Imperatives and Challenges, national security may be defined as:The measurable state of the capability of a nation to overcome the <b>multi-dimensional</b> <b>threats</b> to the apparent well-being of its people and its survival as a nation-state at any given time, by balancing all instruments of state policy through governance, that can be indexed by computation, empirically or otherwise, and is extendable to global security by variables external to it.A concise working definition by Premaratne that paraphrases the aspects of the definitions of Brown, Romm and Paleri defines national security asSafeguarding the sovereignty, territorial integrity, citizenry and socioeconomic functionality of a nation from an aggressor intent on undermining a particular valued aspect of a nation through violent or unjust means ...|$|R
40|$|Plans to {{reintroduce}} the gray wolf into Yellowstone National Park spark a heated 2 ̆ 2 {{not in my}} backyard 2 ̆ 2 (NIMBY) response from many residents of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. This dissertation uses this controversy {{as a case study}} to further explore how framing an issue or proposal as an 2 ̆ 2 unacceptable risk 2 ̆ 2 introduces an issues management argumentative dynamic, procedural tactics, and ideological themes that might be characterized as a 2 ̆ 2 rhetoric of risk. 2 ̆ 2 A rhetoric of risk drives the protestors 2 ̆ 7 loci of available arguments through essentially three levels or dimensions: the scientific/technical or substantive where the discussion centers on assessing the nature of the risk event; the political or procedural where concerns about the fairness of the decision-making process and the effectiveness of risk controls dominate; and the larger sociocultural where deep-seated recurring societal value conflicts over relationships between humans and nature, the government and the governed [...] and questions over distributional fairness, social justice, and science [...] provide the debate 2 ̆ 7 s context. ^ Within the larger theoretical framework of this study, wolf recovery and the nuclear plants or toxic waste facilities usually associated with the NIMBY syndrome actually have a great deal in common as both essentially land use issues and 2 ̆ 2 trans-scientific 2 ̆ 2 public policy [...] areas where scientific or technical expertise appear to formulate the problems but the answers are ultimately debated as matters of conflicting societal values. This study applies Kenneth Burke 2 ̆ 7 s dramatistic method to analyze how the discourse of those who shout 2 ̆ 2 no wolves, no way, nowhere 2 ̆ 2 culturally construct a risk assessment of wolves as <b>multi-dimensional</b> <b>threats</b> to life itself, to resource-bound livelihoods, and to a traditional way of life. By using the ideological themes and slogans of the so-called 2 ̆ 2 wise use 2 ̆ 2 movement, the protestors transform the wolf from a predatory criminal to the even more frightening 2 ̆ 2 spotted owl of the Rockies 2 ̆ 2 whose mere presence will further the environmentalists/federal government conspiracy 2 ̆ 7 s hidden 2 ̆ 2 land lock-up 2 ̆ 2 agenda aimed at closing the West to resource development. ...|$|R
