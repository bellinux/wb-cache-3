In 1754 Thomas Ellison Jr. had noted stonemason William Bull of Hamptonburgh build a stone mansion and <b>mill</b> <b>off</b> Forge Hill Road. The property later passed to his son, John Ellison. Grain {{from as far}} west as Montgomery was ground and sold at this mill. The house later served during the Revolutionary War as a general's headquarters by Nathanael Greene, Horatio Gates and subsequently by Henry Knox.|$|E

50|$|The cotton {{industry}} which replaced a domestic system of handloom weaving became more important {{with the building}} of Kirkhall Lane Mills (Westleigh New Mill) in 1836. Victoria <b>Mills</b> <b>off</b> Kirkhall Lane were built by James and John Hayes between 1856 and 1887 and Firs Mills were built by Tunnicliffe and Hampson.|$|R
50|$|Foster's Mill (also {{known as}} Foster Mills, Foster Mill and Spiller's <b>Mill),</b> <b>off</b> Station Road, was built of painted gault brick in 1898, {{designed}} by the architects Gelder and Kitchen of Hull. It {{is one of the}} largest buildings in Cambridge, as well as being one of the few examples of large-scale industry in the city. The Foster family owned three mills in the city but the University of Cambridge prevented them from constructing railway lines to them, so they built this mill immediately next to the railway station.|$|E
50|$|The mill had a {{good source}} of water power, but the river was unnavigable for delivery. Horses and mules were used to deliver the product to market. In March 1835 the Savage Railroad Company was {{incorporated}} by Amos and Cumberland Williams and other investors with $15,000 in stock to bring a rail spur to the <b>mill</b> <b>off</b> the Patuxent branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and in the 1870s a Bollman Truss Bridge was moved to the spur. This bridge survives and {{is the only one of}} its kind left.|$|E
5000|$|Gerald Andrew became {{managing}} director {{at the end of}} 1961, {{after the death of his}} uncle, William Andrew. At this time circulation stood at around 90,000, having risen from more than 50,000 before the war. Gerald revolutionised the paper in 1962 when news appeared on the front page for the first time (previously only advertisements were present). In October, 1966, the Reporter moved out of Warrington Street to Waterside <b>Mill</b> <b>off</b> Whitelands Road, Ashton, where a new high-speed Crabtree Viscount rotary press was installed, which allowed colour printing.|$|E

Later, a beaten-up Danette tells Linden and Holder that <b>Mills</b> took <b>off</b> with her money and car. She {{mentions}} that he frequently camps near the Canada-US border; his camping gear and maps are kept in her storage unit. At the unit, Linden and Holder find a sleeping bag and lit cigarette. Someone was just there. Hearing the elevator, they split up the pursuit. Mills tackles and assaults Linden as she screams for Holder. He knocks <b>Mills</b> <b>off</b> of her then handcuffs him.|$|R
50|$|Just over {{a mile to}} {{the east}} of the M61 is the hamlet of Whittle Springs. The Leeds and Liverpool Canal passes a {{junction}} in the hamlet, where {{the south end of the}} Lancaster Canal formerly continued north to Walton Summit. This is also the start of a flight of locks called Johnson's Hillock Locks, which continue via Heapey and Wheelton in the direction of Blackburn. Whittle is also known for fishing places, such as Lower <b>Mill</b> <b>off</b> Town Lane and Top Lock. Whittle has many public houses, and it is close to the Shaw Hill golf course on the A6.|$|E
50|$|The HK43, {{which was}} the {{precursor}} to the HK93, was {{for the most part}} identical in appearance to the HK33. Instead of a “push-pin” grip housing, it came with a clip-on style grip housing marked “SF.” In order to save money, H&K used the same fire control group that went into the HK33 models, but with some modifications. The auto-sear was removed from the fire control group, as well as the trip lever, to prevent automatic fire. Moreover, the grip frame housing was modified to prevent the selector lever from going into the full-auto position. The one other modification H&K made for the HK43s was to <b>mill</b> <b>off</b> the trip ledge on the bolt carrier assembly.|$|E
50|$|The miller at this corn mill in 1771 was James Marchane, who {{was joined}} by his son James. James Jr died in 1805 and James Sr died c. 1812. The mill was sketched by G. Samuel in 1818. It had an {{overshot}} waterwheel. The cast iron overshot waterwheel was 12 ft by 2 ft. It was fitted in 1868, replacing a wooden wheel {{which may have been}} breast shot. In 1890, the waterwheel was adapted to drive a set of pumps to supply Westerham. An average of 25000 imp gal could be supplied. The milling machinery was removed in 1936 and during the Second World War a doodlebug landed nearby and blew the roof of the <b>mill</b> <b>off.</b> The derelict building stood in April 1954, but had been demolished by July 1960.|$|E
5000|$|During the BNCR {{renumbering}} of 1897, No.110 {{had received}} number plates {{in the series}} which had [...] "BNCR" [...] in small block capitals above the digits. When it was rebuilt to Class S2, instructions were given that the letters [...] "BNCR" [...] were to be <b>milled</b> <b>off</b> the number plates and in consequence the numbers appeared offset towards {{the bottom of the}} plate.|$|R

50|$|Residential {{areas are}} nearby; {{approximately}} 67% of the 130 people who reside in Copetown have ownership of their home. However, all family units that apply for mortgage applications in Copetown consists of married couples {{with the average}} age of a Copetown mortgage holder being 36 years of age. Agriculture and services are two major industries in Copetown; with options available to either buy the products that already been picked by the farmer or for the consumer to pick the product himself out of the field. Apple season in Copetown typically lasts from August 18 until October 20; when the threats of winter frost first emerge. There are several commercial enterprises in Copetown (including the general store located off Highway 52 and the feed <b>mill</b> <b>off</b> Railway Street). For the local senior citizens, there is a retirement community that is located in the village on the outskirts of Hamilton.|$|E
5000|$|The Shore Road {{is one of}} Belfast's oldest {{roads and}} is {{mentioned}} in the first census of the city - taken in 1757 - as being home to a colony of [...] "Papists". At the time the Shore Road name was applied to a larger area, including what is today known as York Street. The York Street-York Road and lower Shore Road experienced growth during the Industrial Revolution {{as a number of}} factories were located in the area. One of the main factories on York Street was Gallaher's Tobacco factory. It is no longer in operation and the building has been demolished. One of these few industrial buildings still standing is the Jennymount <b>Mill,</b> <b>off</b> the York Road. The building, renamed the Lanyon Building after its architect Charles Lanyon, was reopened as an Office block in 2002. According to Irish journalist Susan McKay, the area was the scene of fierce sectarian rioting throughout the nineteenth century until it was eventually established as a bulwark of working-class Protestantism. The areas further up the Shore Road towards Newtownabbey are for the most part more recent than these areas, with some housing developments such as Shore Crescent and the Rathcoole estate dating to the 1960s and later. Many residents of the overcrowded area {{at the bottom of the}} road were moved up to these new estates. Much of the housing throughout the road has been redeveloped and regenerated.|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} of machine-countersunk flush rivets for aircraft described in reference 1 revealed {{the necessity of}} having {{the height of the}} rivet heads greater than the depth of the countersunk holes if tightly riveted joints were to be obtained. If ordinary roundhead rivets were inserted from {{the opposite side of the}} joint and the countersunk heads formed in the driving of the rivets filled the countersunk holes completely, still tighter joints were obtained. In either case the rivets protruded above the skin surface after driving, and the protruding portion of the rivet heads had to be removed in order to obtain flush rivets. A number of requests have been received for a description of the tool used to <b>mill</b> <b>off</b> the protruding portion of the rivet heads. This report contains assembly and detail drawings of the latest flush-rivet milling tool used at the NACA Structures Research Laboratory. Figure 6 shows the tool in operation. This tool is quite satisfactory for 1 / 8 -inch rivets, but a more powerful motor is recommended for use with larger rivets...|$|E

40|$|FIB/SEM {{tomography}} is {{a relatively}} new imaging technique for 3 D investigation of biological tissue. It uses a dualbeam FIB/SEM instrument to alternately image a sample surface with an electron beam and <b>mill</b> <b>off</b> successive slices with an ion beam, collecting a series of images representing the investigated volume. This technique was employed to study alumina nanoparticles, brain tissue and tissue engineered cartilage embedded in epoxy. Hydrocarbon deposition of contamination layers as well as suboptimal sample geometry, were shown to be issues for imaging experiments. It was important to ensure that sample blocks were cut smoothly, and that the material of interest was concentrated at an edge. The alumina nanoparticle sample was used as a model specimen to investigate the volume of origin of signals detected for image formation at different acceleration voltages. This was shown to have a reasonable correspondance with Monte Carlo simulation results. Imaging and Slice and View experiments on the biological samples showed that FIB/SEM tomography can resolve structures below 10 nm in size, and that detailed 3 D models from properly stained tissue are obtainable. In summary FIB/SEM tomography constitutes a valuable 3 D imaging technique for biological samples. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Iowa Department of Transportation (Iowa DOT) {{through the}} Highway Division is {{responsible}} for the design, construction and maintenance of roadways that will provide a high level of serviceability to the motorist. First, the motorist expects {{to be able to get}} where he wants to go, but now he also demands a minimum level of comfort. In the construction of new roadways, the public is quick to express dissatisfaction with rough pavements. The Highway Division of the Iowa DOT (formerly Iowa State Highway Commission) has a specification which requires a "smooth-riding surface". For over 40 years, new portland cement concrete (pcc) pavement has been checked with a 10 -foot rolling straightedge. The contractor is required to grind, saw or <b>mill</b> <b>off</b> all high spots that deviate more than 1 / 8 " from the 10 -foot straight line. Unfortunately, there are instances where a roadway that will meet the above criteria does not provide a "smooth-riding surface". The roadway may have monger undulations (swales) that result in an undesirable ride. The objective of this project was to develop a repeatable, reliable time stable, lightweight test unit to measure the riding quality of pcc pavement at normal highway speed the day after construction...|$|E
40|$|The Jeffrey L. Brown Institute of Archaeology, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, {{conducted}} archaeological {{monitoring of}} trenching activities {{associated with the}} construction of a six-inch diameter force main sewer pipeline crossing Lookout Creek, Chattanooga, Hamilton County, Tennessee at Mile 0. 7 above the left bank of the Tennessee River. The sewer main extended from the Lora Lee Knitting <b>Mill</b> <b>off</b> Cummings Highway north and west across Lookout Creek for a total extant of about 4130 feet / 1260 meters. The monitoring was conducted for the Hamilton County Engineering Department and was required by the Regulatory Branch of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Tennessee Historical Commission. The Institute performed continuous monitoring of approximately 1880 feet / 570 meters, more or less, of the proposed route of the sewer beginning near the Lora Lee Knitting Mill and running north to the crossing of Lookout Creek. Portions of the sewer trenching on the north/west bank of the creek were also monitored, but coverage of this 2250 feet / 685 meters (more or less) of proposed sewer line on the north/west riverbank was not continuous; this segment of proposed sewer largely followed an existing roadbed. Monitoring on the north/west bank focused on the vicinity of an historic homestead and Civil War battleground. Opportunistic surface collections from the trench spoil yielded 32 fragments of aboriginal lithics from the Lora Lee tract. In addition, one aboriginal ceramic fragment and four pieces of a mineral specimen were recovered. No cultural materials were collected from the trenching north/west of Lookout Creek. In no portion of the observed sewer trench were significant aboriginal or historic features encountered. [URL]...|$|E
