The current 'gocomics' online {{versions}} are usually in colour. Sadly the poor picture reprint quality that <b>marred</b> <b>the</b> 2008 <b>volume</b> is still present in the 2009 book. Many strips look weak and washed out on the finer detail, looking like a photocopy. The 2010 annual is still in black and white, though the printing quality is much better.|$|R

6000|$|These three volumes {{would be}} so {{generally}} interesting, so exceedingly entertaining, that you might bid fair for a sale of the work at large. Then let <b>the</b> fourth <b>volume</b> take up <b>the</b> history of metaphysics, theology, medicine, alchemy, common, canon, and Roman law, from Alfred to Henry VII.; in other words, {{a history of the}} dark ages in Great Britain. The fifth volume--carry on metaphysics and ethics to the present day in the first half; the second half, comprise the theology of all the reformers. In <b>the</b> fourth <b>volume</b> there would be a grand article on the philosophy of the theology of the Roman Catholic religion. In this (fifth volume), under different names,--Hooker, Baxter, Biddle, and Fox,--the spirit of the theology of all the other parts of Christianity. The sixth and seventh volumes must comprise all the articles you can get, on all the separate arts and sciences that have been treated of in books since the Reformation; and, by this time, the book, if it answered at all, would have gained so high a reputation, that you need not fear having whom you liked to write the different articles--medicine, surgery, chemistry, etc., etc., navigation, travellers, voyagers, etc., etc. If I go into Scotland, shall I engage Walter Scott to write the history of Scottish poets? Tell me, however, what you think of the plan. It would have one prodigious advantage: whatever accident stopped the work, would only prevent the future good, not <b>mar</b> <b>the</b> past; each <b>volume</b> would be a great and valuable work [...] "per se". Then each volume would awaken a new interest, a new set of readers, who would buy <b>the</b> past <b>volumes</b> of course; then it would allow you ample time and opportunities for the slavery of <b>the</b> catalogue <b>volumes,</b> which should be at the same time an index to the work, which would be, in very truth, a pandect of knowledge, alive and swarming with human life, feeling, incident. By the bye, what a strange abuse has been made of the word encyclopaedia! It signifies, properly, grammar, logic, rhetoric, and ethics and metaphysics, which last, explaining the ultimate principles of grammar--log., rhet., and eth.--formed a circle of knowledge. * * * To call a huge unconnected miscellany of the [...] "omne scibile", in an arrangement determined by the accident of initial letters, an encyclopaedia, is the impudent ignorance of your Presbyterian bookmakers.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the problem of}} routing in {{opportunistic}} wireless network, and propose a novel routing mechanism, message-aware routing (<b>MAR).</b> Using <b>MAR,</b> <b>the</b> messages can be prioritized at mobile nodes and the resources will be allocated accordingly. <b>The</b> <b>MAR</b> uses <b>the</b> message-aware socializing model to classify mobile nodes into different social groups. In MAR, nodes only maintain up-to-date routing information for the nodes in the same social group and the messages for the nodes in the same social group will have higher priority to be delivered. <b>The</b> <b>MAR</b> improves <b>the</b> routing efficiency in terms of reduced traffic and a higher delivery success rate. Further, MAR is constructed in decentralized way and does not require any centralized infrastructure.
