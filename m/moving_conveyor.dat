40|$|Technological {{advances}} {{in the area of}} spatial sciences over the past 10 [...] 20 years have brought about many new equipment types for the capture of 3 -dimensional data. An emerging technology is the terrestrial laser scanner, which enables the collection of detailed 3 -D data of an area. The implementation of the terrestrial laser scanner in the surveying industry has been slowed by a lack of knowledge of its useful application in comparison with wellunderstood, and practiced, traditional methods. This leads {{to the question of whether}} the terrestrial laser scanners relative accuracies and its practical use in the field are of value to the surveying industry. Scanners allow the collection of data without having to physically touch objects. Their use as surveying instruments is exceptional in situations of limited access to structures or target areas, such as <b>moving</b> <b>conveyors</b> or dangerous heights. and creates large amounts of usable information. Data capture times are short and the instrument may easily be used by a single person. The laser scanner would prove highly valuable as a new surveying tool...|$|R

50|$|An Ultrasonic foil {{is part of}} the {{drainage}} table section of paper machines. A series of hydrofoil blades (called foils) create pressure/vacuum pulses that dewater the fibre/water slurry (called stock) on a <b>moving</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt (the wire). Flexible ceramic foils have been used for years, but ultrasonic foils produce paper of higher quality. High power ultrasonics create millions of pressure pulses from imploding cavitation bubbles which keep the fibres apart, giving them a more uniform distribution. This ends up in better fibre formation, stronger paper and smoother paper surfaces.|$|E

Brief cutscenes between levels tell an abbreviated version of the film's story. Later stages allow the player to control smuggler and pilot Han Solo or Chewbacca the Wookiee.

40|$|Straightforward {{technique}} for generating stereoscopic television images involves use of single television camera translated laterally between left- and right-eye positions.

50|$|The {{industrial}} production of bread became notable during these years. At {{the beginning of}} the 20th century it is estimated that only about 8% of Canadian wives bought bread commercially.

One bakery of note, The Canada Bread Company Limited, was founded in 1911 {{as the result of the}} amalgamation of five smaller companies. Industrial bakeries such as this were characterized by the use of large machines for the mixing of dough, which was placed in pans on slow <b>moving</b> <b>conveyor</b> belts that transported them through giant ovens, where they were baked. Large automated packaging machines wrapped the finished loaves at great speed. Improvements in transportation and packaging technology throughout the decades allowed a shrinking number of bakeries to serve every larger markets.

5000|$|The model 11 Chief was {{designed}} and built by Aeronca Aircraft Corporation. While it shared the name [...] "Chief" [...] with the pre-war models, the design was not a derivative. Rather, the post-war 11AC Chief {{was designed}} {{in tandem with the}} 7AC Champion ("Champ")—the Chief with side-by-side seating and yoke controls, and the Champ with tandem seating and joystick controls. The intention was to simplify production and control costs by building a pair of aircraft with a significant number of parts in common; in fact, the two designs share between 70% and 80% of their parts. The tail surfaces, wings, ailerons, landing gear, and firewall forward—engine, most accessories, and cowling—are common to both airplanes. The Chief and the larger Aeronca Sedan also share selected parts, the control wheels, some control system parts, rudder pedals and control systems, so parts passed from plane to plane to save costs. Production costs and aircraft weights were tightly controlled and Aeronca {{was among the first to}} use a <b>moving</b> <b>conveyor</b> assembly line, with each stage taking about 30 minutes to complete.|$|E
