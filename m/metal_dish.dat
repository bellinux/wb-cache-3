Balti curries are cooked quickly using vegetable oil rather than ghee, over high heat {{in the manner of a}} stir-fry, and any meat is used off the bone. This combination differs sharply from a traditional one-pot Indian curry which is simmered slowly all day. Balti sauce is based on garlic and onions, with turmeric and garam masala among other spices.|$|E

40|$|Chemical-mechanical {{planarization}} (CMP) is a {{key process}} {{in the manufacture of}} ultra-large-scale-integrated (ULSI) semiconductor devices. A major concern in CMP is non-uniform planarization, or polishing, at the wafer-scale- primarily as interconnect <b>metal</b> <b>dishing</b> and dielectric erosion. In conventional face-down CMP, the pad is much larger than the wafer and the wafer is always in contact with the pad. Thus, non-uniform polishing rate at the wafer-scale is due to variations in relative velocity, normal pressure, and especially slurry distribution at the wafer/pad interface. Wafer-scale polishing uniformity requirements are expected to be even more stringent in the future as the ULSI technology advances toward larger wafers (450 mm) and ever shrinking feature sizes (< 20 nm). This thesis presents the theory and experimental validation of a novel, face-up CMP architecture proposed for achieving a high degree, better than 95 percent of polishing uniformity at the wafer-scale. The novel design utilizes a small, perforated pad that contacts only a portio...|$|R

50|$|Many annual {{events are}} held in Victoria Park. These include Sunfest, the Home County Folk Festival, The London Rib-Fest, The International Food Festival, LOLA and Fiesta del Sol. Since 2008 all events in Victoria Park {{are part of the}} Greening of the Festivals and {{required}} to have a waste management plan to eliminate unnecessary waste to landfill. This includes a suitable number of Eco-Stations (the place where attendees dispose of waste) and all food and beverage containers are required to be either recyclable or compostable. In the first year, these efforts led to an improvement from 5% waste diversion to a 50% waste diversion from landfill. The festivals were recognized Nationally with a Home Town Heroes Award, Provincially with a Gold Award from the Recycling Council of Ontario for Minimization of Waste and Municipally with the Pillar non profit Community Impact Award. Home County Folk Festival had the added initiative of offering reusable <b>metal</b> <b>dishes,</b> available on deposit which is repaid at the Eco-Stations, to eliminate one time use disposables altogether. With the EcoStations readily available for waste disposal, Victoria Park has been a cleaner park throughout the festival season.

(c) Brushed <b>metal</b> <b>dish</b> and balls with spatially-varying Ashikhmin-Shirley model. (d) Red satin cloth and greeting card with measured SVBRDFs. We describe a technique for real-time rendering of dynamic, spatially-varying BRDFs in static scenes with all-frequency shadows from environmental and point lights. The 6 D SVBRDF is represented with a general microfacet model and spherical lobes fit to its 4 D spatially-varying normal distribution function (SVNDF). A sum of spherical Gaussians (SGs) provides an accurate approximation with {{a small number of}} lobes. Parametric BRDFs are fit onthe-fly using simple analytic expressions; measured BRDFs are fit as a preprocess using nonlinear optimization. Our BRDF representation is compact, allows detailed textures, is closed under products and rotations, and supports reflectance of arbitrarily high specularity. At run-time, SGs representing the NDF are warped to align the half-angle vector to the lighting direction and multiplied by the microfacet shadowing and Fresnel factors. This yields the relevant 2 D view slice on-the-fly at each pixel, still represented in the SG basis. We account for macro-scale shadowing using a new, nonlinear visibility representation based on spherical signed distance functions (SSDFs). SSDFs allow per-pixel interpolation of high-frequency visibility without ghosting and can be multiplied by the BRDF and lighting efficiently on the GPU.

Nakon kratkog navođenja podataka o tom gradskom prostoru, daje podatke o početnim podmorskim istraživanjima na Kolovarama, a posebno obraduje nalaz keramičkog kalupa za izradu posuda. Obradivši spomenuti kalup, donosi prema dekoraciji na kalupu analogije, te atribuira kalup u vrijeme helenizma. Smatra da su se u kalupu otiskivali krateri koji se mogu vezati uz reljefnu helenističku keramiku, pa pretpostavlja moguću radionicu te keramike koja se u zadnjim stoljećima prije Krista intenzivno importirala u Liburniju, na prostoru Kolovara. Kolovare, {{an area in}} the {{vicinity}} of Zadar, has a natural spring mentioned in the Middle Age as "ad fontem" of "de fontana" and is also known for its two churches and later lazarettos. From Antiquity there is evidence of a Temple of Apollo the Lycian and of a large late antique necropolis. By recent underwater excavations it has been determined that the port known to have existed at this site in the Middle Ages had, in fact dated from Antiquity. A by-product of the excavations was the discovery of a ceramic relief mould for decorated vessels. Its characteristic decorative motifs and design indicate its function in the production of Hellenistic relief ceramics. The size of the cavity indicates that relief craters would have been imprinted in the mould. Such finds are numerous on Liburnian sites and research to date has supposed that Hellenistic ceramics and relief bowls were brought to the area from workshops in the Manian bay (Resnik near Kaštel Novi) and from Vis. These sites too have revealed many examples of such vessels, inspired by the <b>metal</b> <b>dishes</b> of Athens, Corint and Delos. The discovery of the mould in the antique port in Kolovare tells of the existence of a workshop in Jader (Zadar), which was the most important Liburnian centre...|$|R
40|$|Scaling of {{physical}} dimensions {{faster than the}} optical wavelengths or equipment tolerances used in the manufacturing line has led to increased process variability. This in turn has led to unpredictable design, unpredictable manufacturing, and low yields. The result of these physical variations is variation in circuit metrics such as performance and power. Variations can be either systematic (e. g., <b>metal</b> <b>dishing,</b> lithographic proximity effects, etc.) or random (e. g., material variations, dopant fluctuations, etc.). The former can be modeled and predicted while random variations are inherently unpredictable. There are several pattern-dependent process effects which are systematic in nature. These can be compensated during physical design to aid manufacturability and hence improve yield. This thesis focuses on ways to mitigate the impact of systematic variations on design and manufacturing by establishing a bidirectional link between the two. The motivations for doing so are improved yield and manufacturability as well as reduced design guardband and cost. To improve manufacturability, we propose a detailed placement perturbation technique for improved depth of focus and process window. The technique facilitates downstream insertion of scattering bars and etch dummy features in the resolution enhancement process, reducing inter-cell forbidden pitches almost completely. We propose a systematic variation aware timing analysis methodology to reduce timing pessimism. The Proposed self-compensated design techniques achieve circuit robustness to focus variation. We also propose the use of small gate-length biases to reduce leakage power and leakage power variability. To reduce design guardbanding, we have proposed a methodology for power/performance analyses of the design based on lithography-simulation output. We also give the first method for performance-impact limited metal fill insertion. Finally, to reduce mask cost, mask data volume, as well as mask data preparation time, we propose a novel design-aware optical proximity correction (OPC) methodolog...|$|R
