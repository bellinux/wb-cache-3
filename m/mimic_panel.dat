40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} {{for the study of}} wooden panel {{paintings}} using air-coupled acoustical imaging is presented. In order to evaluate the advantages of the technique, several samples were made to <b>mimic</b> <b>panel</b> paintings along with their typical defects. These specimens were tested by means of both single-sided and through-transmission techniques using planar transducers. Image data were processed by means of a two-dimensional (2 D) -fast Fourier transform-based algorithm to increase the S/N ratio and 2 -D representations (C-scans) were generated. The simulated defects were imaged using both configurations. Investigations were undertaken on four antique paintings from a private collection. The results presented and discussed in this investigation confirm both the robustness and the effectiveness of the technique in detecting defects such as delaminations and cracks in wooden panel paintings...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} developing and using a library of graphic symbols for components of power equipment under the state standards GOST 21. 403 - 80 “Power Equipment” and GOST 2. 789 - 74 “Heat Exchangers”. The library is implemented in the SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format. The obtained solutions {{are in line with}} the well-known studies on creating libraries of parametrical fragments of symbols for elements of diagrams and drawings in design systems for various industrial applications. The SVG format is intended for use in web applications, so the creation of SVG codes for power equipment under GOST 21. 403 - 80 and GOST 2. 789 - 74 is an essential stage in the development of web programs for the thermodynamic optimization of power plants. One of the major arguments in favor of the SVG format is that it can be integrated with codes. So, in process control systems developed based on a web platform, scalable vector graphics provides for a dynamic user interface, functionality of <b>mimic</b> <b>panels</b> and changeability of their components depending on the availability and status of equipment. An important reason for the acquisition and use of the SVG format is also that it is becoming the basis (recommended for the time being, and mandatory in future) for electronic document management in the sphere of design documentation as part of international efforts to standardize and harmonize data exchange formats. In a specific context, the effectiveness of the SVG format for the power equipment arrangement has been shown. The library is intended for solution of specific production problems involving an analysis of the power plant thermal circuits and in training of power engineering students. The library and related materials are publicly available through the Internet. A number of proposals on the future evolution of the library have been formulated...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of olfactory and visual cues in host finding of the pine bark beetles Hylastes ater and Hylurgus ligniperda and the burnt pine longhorn beetle Arhopalus ferus. The ultimate aim {{of this research was}} to provide new information on attractant and repellent (such as non-host leaf volatiles) stimuli to improve monitoring methods and reduce the attack by wood-boring and bark beetle species. A field trapping trial of visual and olfactory cues near Nelson caught 7842 H. ater, 274, 594 H. ligniperda and 16, 301 A. ferus adults. There were significant effects of both visual (colour and sihoutte) and olfactory (host and non-host volatiles) cues for all three species. The highest catches were in black (host <b>mimicking),</b> <b>panel</b> flight intercept traps baited with attractant (α-pinene and ethanol) and the lowest in clear or white (non-host mimicking) control traps. The repellent, green leaf volatiles (GLV) ((E) - 2 -hexen- 1 -ol & (Z) - 3 -hexen- 1 -ol) when present on traps with attractant reduced catches significantly but modestly in H. ater and H. ligniperda, but had no significant effect on A. ferus. A field trial near Christchurch found that GLV applied as a topical repellent halved the number of beetles attacking Pinus radiata logs. This reduction was significant in H. ligniperda, but not quite (P = 0. 07) in H. ater. Placing logs among broadleaved plants (natural sources of non-host volatiles) significantly reduced attack of H. ligniperda by about 75 % compared to logs in the open, but had no effect on H. ater. Attack by H. ater was found on 4 % of 500 P. radiata seedlings in a field trial near Dunedin. Treatment of seedlings with GLV significantly affected the severity and proportion of seedlings attacked by H. ater, compared with insecticide-treated and control seedlings, but the treatment effect was apparently driven by an unexpected direct damaging effect of GLV on the health of seedlings. It is recommended that future research explores the use of non-host volatiles from natural sources that influence host finding in wood–boring and bark beetle species for the protection of plantation forests in New Zealand...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Genomic {{selection}} (GS) {{has played}} an important role in cattle breeding programs. However, genotyping prices are still a challenge for implementation of GS in beef cattle and there is still a lack of information about the use of low-density Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) chip panels for genomic predictions in breeds such as Brazilian Braford and Hereford. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of using imputed genotypes in the accuracy of genomic predictions for twenty economically important traits in Brazilian Braford and Hereford beef cattle. Various scenarios composed by different percentages of animals with imputed genotypes and different sizes of the training population were compared. De-regressed EBVs (estimated breeding values) were used as pseudo-phenotypes in a Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (GBLUP) model using two different <b>mimicked</b> <b>panels</b> derived from the 500 K (80 K and 150 K SNP panels), which were subsequently imputed to the 500 K panel. In addition, genomic prediction accuracies generated from a 7770 K SNP (imputed from the 500 K SNP) were presented as another alternate scenario. Results The accuracy of genomic breeding values averaged over the twenty traits ranged from 0. 38 to 0. 40 across the different scenarios. The average losses in expected genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) accuracy (accuracy obtained from the inverse of the mixed model equations) relative to the true 500 K genotypes ranged from 2 ̆ 2120. 0007 to 2 ̆ 2120. 0012 and from 2 ̆ 2120. 0002 to 2 ̆ 2120. 0005 when using the 500 K imputed from the 80 K or 150 K, respectively. When using the imputed 7770 K panel the average losses in expected GEBV accuracy was 2 ̆ 2120. 0021. The average gain in expected EBVs accuracy by including genomic information when compared to simple BLUP was between 0. 02 and 0. 03 across scenarios and traits. Conclusions The percentage of animals with imputed genotypes in the training population did not significantly influence the validation accuracy. However, the size of the training population played a major role in the accuracies of genomic predictions in this population. The losses in the expected accuracies of GEBV due to imputation of genotypes were lower when using the 500 K SNP chip panel imputed from the 150 K compared to the one imputed from the 80 K SNP chip panel...|$|R
500|$|Eric Bana {{commented that}} the shoot was, [...] "Ridiculously serious... a silent set, morbid {{in a lot of}} ways." [...] Lee told him that he was {{shooting}} a Greek tragedy: he would be making a [...] "whole other movie" [...] about the Hulk at Industrial Light & Magic. An example of Lee's art house approach to the film was taking Bana to watch a bare-knuckle boxing match. Visual effects supervisor Dennis Muren was on the set every day. One of the many visual images in the film that presented an acting challenge for Bana was a split screen technique employed by Lee to cinematically <b>mimic</b> the <b>panels</b> of a comic book page. This required many more takes of individual scenes than normal. Sound design was completed at Skywalker Sound. Muren and other ILM animators used previous technology from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (for the Dobby character) to create the Hulk with computer-generated imagery. Other software used included PowerAnimator, Softimage XSI, and RenderMan Interface Specification. ILM started computer animation work in 2001, and completed in May 2003, just one month before the film's release. Lee provided some motion capture work in post-production.|$|R
40|$|Wine is {{a complex}} {{chemical}} matrix and for this reason, human panels are widely used in the industry for the global evaluation of wine samples. Chemical sensor arrays (electronic nose and electronic tongue) represent the instrumental alternative to this global analysis, since their working mechanism can reproduce the classification properties of sensorial analysis and also quantify both sensorial descriptors and chemical parameters of wine. The evidence that human senses cooperate in the sensory evaluation led to study the integration of these devices and, in some cases including also optical systems, to develop an electronic panel able to better <b>mimic</b> the human <b>panel</b> evaluations. In this chapter we reviewed the different applications of these integrated sensor systems {{for the analysis of}} wine. © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|Over {{the last}} three centuries the garden has had a number of garden houses, forcing pits and framed {{structures}} recorded in Croome's archives. Today, The Walled Gardens showcases the fully restored melon and cucumber house and the peach and fig house, alongside the converted vinery house. The foundations still remain from the original tomato house, forcing beds, pineapple pits, and orchard house all which will be restored in years to come. After three years of dedicated restoration the melon and cucumber house now channels the rain water from its roof into a large storage tank under the terrace which is then pumped inside through a network of pipes to water an array of produce from vines to bananas, fully supporting the owners' ethos of sustainable and eco-friendly living. The mechanical inventions of the 18th century have been put to their test in the peach and fig house, with the creation of bespoke steel winding mechanisms to open and close groups of sash and hinging <b>panels,</b> <b>mimicking</b> the old brass rollers now replaced with oil impregnated nylon in stainless steel housings.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the design and}} performance of a photovoltaic (PV) emulator. With increasing interest in renewable energies, {{large amounts of money}} and effort are being put into research and development for photovoltaic systems. The larger interest in PV systems has increased demand for appropriate equipment with which to test PV systems. A photovoltaic emulator is a power supply with similar current and voltage characteristics as a PV panel. This work uses an existing power supply which is manipulated via Labview to emulate a photovoltaic panel. The emulator calculates a current-voltage (I-V) curve based on the user specified parameters of panel model, irradiance and temperature. When a load change occurs, the power supply changes its current and voltage to track the calculated I-V curve, so as to <b>mimic</b> a solar <b>panel.</b> Over 250 different solar panels at varying irradiances and temperatures are able to be accurately emulated. A PV emulator provides a controlled environment that is not affected by external factors such as temperature and weather. This allows repeatable conditions on which to test PV equipment, such as inverters, and provides a controlled environment to test an overall PV system...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis study aims at {{evaluating}} Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) as {{a reliable}} technique for {{the characterization of}} viscoelastic properties of soft tissues. Three phantoms with different concentrations of plastisol and softener were prepared in order to mechanically <b>mimic</b> a broad <b>panel</b> of healthy and pathological soft tissues. Once placed in a MRI device, each sample was excited by a homemade external driver, inducing shear waves within the medium. The storage (G') and loss (G") moduli of each phantom were then reconstructed from MRE acquisitions over a frequency range from 300 to 1, 000 Hz, by applying a 2 D Helmholtz inversion algorithm. At the same time, mechanical tests were performed on four samples of each phantom with a High-Frequency piezo-Rheometer (HFR) over an overlapping frequency range (from 160 to 630 Hz) with the same test conditions (temperature, ageing). The comparison between both techniques shows a good agreement in the measurement of the storage and loss moduli, underlying the capability of MRE to noninvasively assess the complex shear modulus G* of a medium and its interest for investigating the viscoelastic properties of living tissues. Moreover, the phantoms with varying concentrations of plastisol {{used in this study}} show interesting rheological properties, which make them good candidates to simulate the broad variety of viscoelastic behaviors of healthy and pathological soft tissues...|$|R
5000|$|No. 3. 193 North Calumet Road, c.1905, The Chesterton Tribune Building is {{the most}} {{southern}} building and was built c. 1905 after the great fire of 1902. It is considered a Twentieth Century function style, similar {{to most of the}} buildings in the district. The Chesterton Tribune commissioned construction of this building in 1904 and it continues to serve as the paper's headquarters. Arthur Bowser first published the paper in 1884 * and he owned the paper when {{the decision was made to}} build this structure. It is a two-story brick commercial building. The ground floor storefront has been altered; stucco covers the kick panels and piers. An old-fashioned style simple cloth awning covers the storefront. The original steel or iron I-beam spanning the ground floor remains intact along with the decorative rosettes. The red brick walls rise above the I-beam and three windows puncture the wall, each with dressed stone sills and lintels. Centered over the windows, a stone tablet reads [...] "The Chesterton Tribune". The elaborate parapet gives the building a slight Romanesque Revival style flavor. First, a beltcourse of sawtooth-laid brick runs across, then a frieze of alternating recessed single bricks. The raised brick corbels dividing the upper parapet into four <b>panels</b> <b>mimic</b> machicolations, with infilling of progressively corbeled courses of brick. J.G. Graessle bought the paper from Bowser in 1923, Warren Canright purchased it in 1928, and held the paper until his death in 1975. His son Warren and grandson David continue to publish the Tribune out of the building.

40|$|The INL {{operates}} the HSSL {{to conduct research}} {{in the design and}} evaluation of advanced reactor control rooms, integration of intelligent support systems to assist operators, development and assessment of advanced human performance models, and visualizations to assess advanced operational concepts across various infrastructures. This advanced facility consists of a reconfigurable simulator and a virtual reality capability (known as the Computer-Aided Virtual Environment (CAVE)) (Figure 2). It supports human factors research, including human-in-the-loop performance, HSI, and analog and digital hybrid control displays. It {{can be applied to the}} development and evaluation of control systems and displays for complex systems such as existing and advanced NPP control rooms, command and control systems, and advance emergency operations centers. The HSSL incorporates a reconfigurable control room simulator, which is currently housed in the Center for Advanced Energy Studies (CAES), a joint venture of the DOE and the Idaho University System. The simulator is a platform- and plant-neutral environment intended for full-scope and part-task testing of operator performance in various control room configurations. The simulator is not limited to a particular plant or even simulator architecture. It can support engineering simulator platforms from multiple vendors using digital interfaces. Due to its ability to be reconfigured, it is possible to switch the HSI - not just to digital panels but also to different control modalities such as those using greater plant automation or intelligent alarm filtering. The simulator currently includes three operator workstations, each capable of driving up to eight 30 -inch monitors. The size and number of monitors varies depending on the particular front-end simulator deployed for a simulator study. These operator workstations would typically be used for the shift supervisor or senior reactor operator, reactor operator, and assistant reactor operator in current US NPPs. In addition to the three workstations, information can be shared between the workstations and further displayed on a large-screen overview display or a <b>panel</b> <b>mimic.</b> An 82 -inch high-definition display is commonly used for the overview display...|$|R
