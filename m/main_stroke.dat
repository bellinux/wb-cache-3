2500|$|Swimming as a sport {{predominantly}} involves participants competing to be {{the fastest}} over a given distance. [...] Competitors swim different distances in different levels of competition. For example, swimming has been an Olympic sport since 1896, and the current program includes events from 50 m to 1500 m in length, across all four <b>main</b> <b>strokes</b> and medley.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are four}} <b>main</b> <b>strokes</b> used in {{competition}} and recreation swimming: the front crawl, {{also known as}} freestyle, the breaststroke, the backstroke and the butterfly.

[...] The butterfly stroke developed in the 1930s, and was considered {{a variant of the}} breaststroke until accepted as a separate style in 1953. Butterfly is also known as the hardest stroke to many, but it burns the most calories compared to the other 3 strokes.|$|R
5000|$|Compared to Figgins' [...] "antique", the Clarendon design uses {{somewhat}} less emphatic serifs, which are bracketed rather than solid blocks, that widen as {{they reach the}} <b>main</b> <b>stroke</b> of the letter. Besley's design {{was not the first}} font with this style by at least three years, as typefaces labelled [...] "Ionic" [...] had already appeared in this style (other typefaces would copy this name), but the Clarendon design was particularly popular and its name rapidly copied. Historian James Mosley suggests that an inspiration for these designs may have been the style of handlettered capitals used by copper-plate engravers.|$|E
5000|$|Large flat gongs may be 'primed' by lightly hitting {{them before}} the <b>main</b> <b>stroke,</b> greatly {{enhancing}} the sound and causing the instrument to [...] "speak" [...] sooner, with a shorter delay for the sound to [...] "bloom". Keeping this priming stroke inaudible calls for {{a great deal of}} skill. The smallest suspended gongs are played with bamboo sticks or even western-style drumsticks. Contemporary and avant-garde music, where different sounds are sought, will often use friction mallets (producing squeals and harmonics), bass bows (producing long tones and high overtones), and various striking implements (wood/plastic/metal) to produce the desired tones.|$|E
5000|$|Clarendons have a bold, solid {{structure}}, {{similar in}} letter structure to the [...] "modern" [...] serif typefaces {{popular in the}} nineteenth century for body text (for instance showing an 'R' with a curled leg and ball terminals on the 'a' and 'c'), but bolder and with less contrast in stroke weight. Clarendon designs generally have a structure with bracketed serifs, which become larger as they reach the <b>main</b> <b>stroke</b> of the letter. Mitja Miklavčič describes the basic features of Clarendon designs (and ones labelled Ionic, often quite similar) as: [...] "plain and sturdy nature, strong bracketed serifs, vertical stress, large x-height, short ascenders and descenders, typeface with little contrast" [...] and supports Nicolete Gray's description of them as a [...] "cross between the roman body text type and slab serif model". Gray notes that nineteenth-century Ionic and Clarendon faces have [...] "a definite differentiation between the thick and the thin strokes", unlike some other more geometric slab-serifs.|$|E
50|$|Slab serifs form a {{large and}} varied genre. Some such as Memphis and Rockwell have a {{geometric}} design with minimal variation in stroke width: they are sometimes described as sans-serif fonts with added serifs. Others {{such as those of}} the Clarendon genre have a structure more like most other serif fonts, though with larger and more obvious serifs. These designs may have bracketed serifs which increase width along their length before merging with the <b>main</b> <b>strokes</b> of the letters, while on geometrics the serifs have a constant width.|$|R

In {{the frame of the}} South European Geomagnetic Array (SEGMA), a European collaboration runs ULF fluxgate instruments providing con- tinuously magnetic field data recorded in mid- and south Eu- rope. The main scientific objective is the investigation of signal variations due to seismic activity and the discrimi- nation between other natural and human influences. The SEGMA station closest to the L’Aquila earthquake epicen- ter is L’Aquila observatory located in the epicenter region. For the scientific analysis we extract the nighttime period from 22 : 00 – 02 : 00 UT and determine the power spectral den- sity (PSD) of the horizontal (H) and vertical (Z) magnetic field components and the standardized polarization ratio (Z) over (H). To discriminate local emissions from global ge- omagnetic effects, data from three SEGMA stations in dis- tances up to 630 km from the epicenter region are analyzed and further compared to the independent global geomagnetic Kp index. Apart from indirect ionospheric effects, elec- tromagnetic noise could be originated in the lithosphere due to tectonic mechanisms in the earthquake focus. To estimate the amplitude of assumed lithospheric electromagnetic noise emissions causing anomalies in the PSD of the (Z) compo- nent, we consider magnetotelluric calculations of the electric crust conductivity in the L’Aquila region.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} known reverse contrast types date {{to about}} 1821. They were created H.W. Caslon company in London, presumably as {{a parody of}} Didone typefaces and lettering of the period. Nicolete Gray, quoting Francis Thibaudeau, wrote in Nineteenth Century Ornamented Typefaces that the style appeared (presumably as lettering) in France slightly earlier during the First French Empire (1804-1815) without giving a specific example. The typeface had very thick serifs, so {{the gap between the}} serifs and the <b>main</b> <b>strokes</b> making up the letters was very small, as can be seen on letters such as 'E' and 'S'. To make the effect even more shocking, the thicker line on the 'A' was moved from its normal position on the right to the left, making a letter {{that seems to be the}} wrong way round. A caps-only design, steel master punches for the typeface (perhaps not the very first) survive in the collection of the St Bride Library, London.

5000|$|While the set book-hand, in square or rustic capitals, {{was used}} for the copying of books, the writing of {{everyday}} life, letters and documents of all kinds, was in a cursive form, the oldest examples of which are provided by the graffiti on walls at Pompeii (CIL, iv), a series of waxen tablets, also discovered at Pompeii (CIL, iv, supplement), a similar series found at Verespatak in Transylvania (CIL, iii) and a number of papyri. From a study of a number of documents which exhibit transitional forms, it appears that this cursive was originally simplified capital writing. The evolution was so rapid, however, that at quite an early date the scriptura epistolaris of the Roman world can no longer be described as capitals. By the 1st century, this kind of writing began to develop the principal characteristics of two new types: the uncial and the minuscule cursive. With the coming into use of writing surfaces which were smooth, or offered little resistance, the unhampered haste of the writer altered the shape, size and position of the letters. In the earliest specimens of writing on wax, plaster or papyrus, there appears a tendency to represent several straight strokes by a single curve. The cursive writing thus foreshadows the specifically uncial forms. The same specimens show great inequality in the height of the letters; the <b>main</b> <b>strokes</b> are prolonged upwards (= b; = d) or downwards (= q; [...] = s). In this direction, the cursive tends to become a minuscule hand.|$|R

40|$|A new {{parameter}} transformation method, called chain-code transform (CT), {{has been}} introduced. It is particularly well-suited for {{the recognition of}} patterns containing straight lines especially handwritten Chinese characters, which consist mainly of straight strokes in four directions. The CT method essentially maps the strokes of a character into a 2 -dimensional parameter space {{similar to that of}} the Hough transform. However, by the novel use of the chain-code representation of characters, the background noise problem of Hough transform is eliminated. Furthermore, the CT method has the additional advantage of quantizing the orientation axis into four directions which coincide with the <b>main</b> <b>stroke</b> directions of Chinese characters. Preliminary recognition experiments have been conducted on a small database with a total of 3600 Chinese characters written by 20 individuals.

Monoparetic stroke {{was defined as a}} motor deficit in either an arm or a leg but without facial weakness or speech disturbance. Median follow-up period was 32. 0 months. Kaplan-Meier survival curves, log-rank tests, logistic regressions, and Cox proportional hazards models were used for clinical outcome analyses. Results. The mean age (313 men and 273 women) was 67. 6 years. Among monoparetic patients, most had cortical (80. 6 %) and multiple (64. 5 %) lesions. The <b>main</b> <b>stroke</b> mechanisms were cardioembolism (38. 7 %) and large artery atherosclerosis (29. 0 %).

Many of the multitude of massage techniques share some of the same basic strokes but the application of these strokes may vary slightly depending on the intent of the stroke and the practitioners skill level. For instance Tellington Touch currently has twenty five massage manipulations and Linda Tellington is adding new touches from time to time. Each one of these touches is designed to have specific effects on the physiological, mental, energetic, emotional and spiritual systems of the animal. Tui-Na has five different named manipulations, seventeen subdivisions of the basic five and four special manipulations for the passive movement of the joints. The five basic Tui-Na manipulations are Bai Dong Fa (swinging), Mo Ca Fa (friction), Ji Ya Fa (squeezing), Zhen Dong Fa (trembling) and Kou Ji Fa (percussing). The subdivisions of each main manipulation are: 1. Bai Dong Fa (swinging): Yi-zhi-chan (single thumb), Gun-fa (rolling) and Rou-fa (rotary-kneading. 2.Mo Ca Fa (friction): Mo-fa (touching skin and muscle) Ca-fa (rubbing), Tui-fa (pushing), Cuo-fa (kneading) and Moo-fa (daubing/massaging) 3.Ji Ya Fa (squeezing): An-fa (pressing), Dian-fa (knocking), Nie-fa (pinching), Na-fa (pulling) and Nian-fa (holding-kneading) 4.Zhen Dong Fa (trembling): Dou-fa (shaking) and Zhen-fa (vibrating) 5.
