In 1967 Evans {{became a member of}} the East Coast chapter of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). She stated that she became interested in the civil rights movement after getting attacked by police during a demonstration at the Pentagon. “When I first became a political activist, I was a pacifist. I had never experience real violence in <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>life</b> and naively hoped that it changed.” Evans demonstrated her interest in anti-racism movements by supporting various groups championing Black, Native and Puerto Rican liberation causes.|$|E
25|$|Why did I take <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>life?</b> Well, {{when you}} {{committed}} two double murders you would too. Yes I did kill Betty Jo Booker and Paul Martin {{in the city}} park that night, and killed Mr. Starks {{and tried to get}} Mrs. Starks. You wouldn't have guessed it, I did it when Mother was either out or asleep, and no one saw me do it. For the guns, I disassembled them and discarded them in different places. When I am found, which has already been done, please give this typewriter to Craig , and tell him that I hope that his child is a boy, it will (help) him in his work. Everything can go wherever you think it will do best except for the View-Master which will go to Belva Jo. Please take my bankroll and give it to Daddy, I think it should go to him, and tell him I don't want the car now.|$|E
500|$|I {{never thought}} of them as {{personal}} songs in terms of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>life</b> but they were personality songs. They were all about my obsessions and images.

500|$|I must {{express my}} deep and sincere {{gratitude}} to John Cage. The {{reason for this}} is that in <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>life,</b> in my own development, for a long period I struggled to avoid being [...] "Japanese", to avoid [...] "Japanese" [...] qualities. It was largely through my contact with John Cage that I came to recognize the value of my own tradition.|$|E
500|$|... "Reflektor" [...] is a dance-rock, indie rock, and disco song. The track's lyrical content is, in part, {{influenced}} by the differences between Haitian life {{and that of the}} Western world, with vocalist and guitarist Win Butler noting, [...] "I think that life [...] is incredibly difficult and it's more amazing to see people that don't have access to food or clean water throw a party. It's not like I'm trying to sing about their experiences. I was more learning from what I saw and applying it to <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>life,</b> lyrically. I'm not trying to tell other people's stories. We're just trying to allow an experience to change you." ...|$|E

Once we had a basic story, I started {{cataloging}} the strange coincidences in <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>life.</b> [...] For example, I was in the Vancouver airport waiting for a flight when John Denver came on over the loudspeaker.

40|$|Life {{is often}} {{compared}} to a maze. Each decision is a path that leads to another path, towards some goal and, inevitably, an exit.

It is presented as an entry into <b>my</b> <b>own</b> thoughts. It is offered as an exercise in sharing another's vision. If you take my hand and walk through it, you will experience how I choose one obstacle over the other. You can follow my steps and tread my course with me...|$|R

500|$|In 1961 and 1962 Bannon {{also contributed}} several {{articles}} to ONE, Inc., the magazine of a homophile activist organization in Southern California. One {{of them was}} a chapter that had been cut from the final draft of Women in the Shadows. She was invited to speak to the Mattachine Society in the early 1960s, but her husband's stern disapproval of her activities began to take its toll. She stated later, [...] "It began to be very painful. So every time I would start to reach out (to the lesbian/gay community), I would get struck down...In <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>life,</b> I couldn't operationalize (my feeling that gays should end the secrecy and take more pride in themselves and their lives).

500|$|The {{inspiration}} {{is taken}} from <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>life,</b> but also all my girlfriends who are very strong, confident girls {{who want to be}} their best in all levels of life. They’re kind of like overachievers and never seem to be satisfied with how [...] they achieve in life. I can see that with myself as well because you expect so much from yourself. You expect yourself to be the best friend, have a great career, be really talented and be able to cook—you just have to be great at everything. I think genders have been washed out a little bit -- like you have to have masculine qualities as well as feminine. It’s just a song that recognizes {{what it takes to be}} a girl today, and it’s quite a lot.|$|E
500|$|However, {{executive}} producer Bill Panzer {{was intrigued by}} the idea that a mortal would want to spend their life with an Immortal, this choice having several drawbacks. MacLeod does not age, while Tessa is mortal and will age. Despite their mutual wish, they know growing old together is impossible and this uneasy thought [...] "...haunts them both, sometimes more than others." [...] As an Immortal, MacLeod is also sterile and Tessa resigns herself to having no children. [...] "" [...] deals with Tessa's choice and its impact upon her life. In this episode, Tessa becomes very fond of a four-year-old girl and muses; [...] "For a while there, just for a few hours... I felt like she was mine. I liked how it felt. But, she's not... I have <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>life</b> and it's more than enough." [...] Panzer commented that [...] "The Sea Witch" [...] "...brings forth in a very powerful way what exactly 's giving up to be with MacLeod." ...|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Ultimatium" [...] {{at the end}} of {{the second}} volume of Either/Or hinted at a future {{discussion}} of the religious stage in The Two Upbuilding Discourses, [...] "Ask yourself and keep on asking until you find the answer, for one may have known something many times, acknowledged it; one may have willed something many times, attempted it-and yet, only the deep inner motion, only the heart’s indescribable emotion, only that will convince you that what you have acknowledged belongs to you, that no power can take it from you-for only the truth that builds up is truth for you." [...] This discussion is included in Stages on Life's Way (1845). The first two sections revisit and refine the aesthetic and ethical stages elucidated in Either/Or, while the third section, Guilty/Not Guilty is about the religious stage and refers specifically to Goethe's other book, The Autobiography of Goethe: Truth and Poetry, from <b>My</b> <b>Own</b> <b>Life</b> vol 1, 2 ...|$|E
500|$|... "I wrote a song a {{while back}} even before [...] "One Sweet Day" [...] {{and it was not}} my {{favorite}} song in the world, but I wrote it. Someone asked me to write a song and they told me the story, and you know {{it was kind of a}} moving concept or whatever. And I did it, and I was like you know it’s not necessarily what I like per se, but after doing the song over and over again and having people coming up to and saying, thank you for writing ‘Hero’ because it saved my life or it saved my father’s life or my brothers or sisters life, or something of that nature, I said I always have to sing that song when I’m performing because if I don’t, you never know who I’m leaving out and you know what, in times of my life I’ve had to turn to that song lyrically and flip it onto <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>life</b> and sing it to myself. So its from the ‘Music Box’ album, and it’s called ‘Hero', this is for you." ...|$|E
500|$|Krabs values money {{more than}} his own {{well-being}} and assesses the other characters based on their financial value to him. The only exceptions are Pearl and his girlfriend Mrs. Puff. His love for Mrs. Puff {{is so strong that}} it temporarily transcends his greed and drives him to buy her expensive gifts. Krabs tolerates his two employees because they work for little pay and because of their positive impact on his finances, but he is quick to rebuke them if they engage in behavior that drives away customers. Krabs has a tentative father-son relationship with SpongeBob; Krabs often scolds him if he gets in trouble, but at times gives him fatherlike advice. Former showrunner Paul Tibbitt has stated that this Krabs-SpongeBob dynamic is his favorite part of the show, telling Digital Spy in 2011 that [...] "the aspect of SpongeBob I love the most is his undying loyalty to Mr. Krabs. No matter how Mr. Krabs treats him. I try to replicate that in <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>life</b> in every way." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Damage a Man Can Do" [...] {{was filmed}} in early October 2008. On playing Harry as {{a figment of}} Dexter's imagination, James Remar told Vanity Fair that [...] "it's {{challenging}} to play a specter in somebody’s current existence." [...] He said: [...] "In <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>life,</b> I find myself doing some task [...] and {{having a conversation with}} my mother or father, who are both deceased. [...] I suspect lots of people do it. And when I hold that conversation, different images of my parents appear to me. And so it's my job to do my best to be that image in Dexter's mind." [...] When asked about playing the only character to join Dexter in his [...] "kill room," [...] Jimmy Smits said: [...] "The crew has a great respect for what they are doing in those scenes. They are energized because those moments are the staple of the show, {{but at the same time}} they are very somber. Michael doesn't really like to interface with a lot of people on those days, because it's such a serious subject matter." ...|$|E
500|$|Jam and Lewis {{were the}} primary instrumentalists for the recording, {{including}} percussion, piano, drums, and also provided background vocals. Jackson accompanied Jam and Lewis on keyboard and took part in composing the arrangements. Stephen Holden of The New York Times observed the album was prominent example of the developing relationship with musicians and modern technology, stating [...] "...technology has altered the form, shape, scale and even the meaning of popular music... The album wasn't created by a studio band, as were most pop-rock albums in the 1960s and '70s, but by the producers and the singer programming mechanized drum and keyboard textures." [...] Jackson's father disapproved of the new material and image of Control, claiming it would never sell. In a cover story for Spin magazine titled [...] "Damn It, Janet: The Battle for Control of Janet Jackson," [...] Joseph was reported saying [...] "f Janet listens to me, she'll {{be as big as}} Michael." [...] She and McClain disregarded his objections. Commenting on the final product, Jackson stated: [...] "It's aggressive, cocky, very forward. It expresses exactly who I am and how I feel.

500|$|Motivated {{by her own}} {{battle to}} gain {{credibility}} as {{a woman in a}} field dominated by male astronomers, [...] Rubin encouraged girls interested in investigating the universe to pursue their dreams. She faced discouraging comments on her choice of study throughout her life, but persevered, supported by family and colleagues. In addition to astronomy, Rubin was a force for greater recognition of women in the sciences and for scientific literacy. She and Burbidge advocated together for more women in the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), on review panels, and in academic searches. She said that despite her struggles with the NAS, she continued to be dissatisfied with the number of women who are elected each year, and called it [...] "the saddest part of [...] life". Rubin was Jewish, and saw no conflict between science and religion. In an interview, she stated: [...] "In <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>life,</b> my science and my religion are separate. I'm Jewish, and so religion to me is a kind of moral code and a kind of history. I try to do my science in a moral way, and, I believe that, ideally, science should be looked upon as something that helps us understand our role in the universe." ...|$|E
5000|$|Nabokov {{rated the}} book highly. In an {{interview}} for BBC Television in 1962, he said: Lolita is a special favorite of mine.
