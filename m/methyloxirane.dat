Sodium hydroxide {{was used as a}} catalyst. The overall conversion rate of <b>methyloxirane</b> in alkaline starch solution is determined by the rate of four parallel reactions: the catalyzed and uncatalyzed hydroxypropylation of starch and the catalyzed and uncatalyzed hydrolysis of <b>methyloxirane.</b> All reactions appear to be first order in both reactants. The temperature dependency of all rate constants can be described by an Arrhenius equation, as follows: for catalyzed hydroxypropylation, k 1, 1 = 42. 8 X 10 (3) e- 66390 /RT; for uncatalyzed hydroxypropylation, k* 1, 1 = 39 e- 71200 /RT; for catalyzed hydrolysis of <b>methyloxirane,</b> k 1, 1 ** = 32. 8 x 10 (4) e- 71400 /RT; for uncatalyzed hydrolysis of <b>methyloxirane,</b> k 1, 1 *** = 449. 4 e- 77150 /RT; with k in m 3 /(mol. s), R in J/(mol.

On this acidic material various reaction types could be observed. For <b>methyloxirane</b> the major transformation pathways were the acid-catalyzed ring opening and dimerization producing various dioxolane and dioxane derivatives.

40|$|The {{high-temperature}} ring-opening {{reactions of}} <b>methyloxirane</b> were investigated {{with or without}} added hydrogen over silica-supported Pd and Rh catalysts. Without added hydrogen, mainly isomerization occurred, giving acetone through the rupture of the sterically less hindered C-O bond (route b). With added hydrogen, hydrogenative ring opening also took place and the sterically more hindered C-O bond was broken as well (route a). At 473 K allyl alcohol was formed too: a product not found at lower temperatures. Since route a was predominant over both catalysts, a bifunctional mechanism had to be considered.

This reaction {{and other aspects}} of the reactivity of the "LRh" fragment (hydrogenation of olefins and benzene) have been studied by density functional theory. The results indicate that for 2, 2 -dimethyloxirane (and probably also for <b>methyloxirane)</b> the reaction starts with C-H activation of a methyl group, followed by ring opening and decarbonylation. For the parent oxirane, where this path is not available, the reaction starts with C-O activation to form a 2 -rhodaoxetane, which then undergoes β-elimination. More generally, easy C-H activation, which appears to be a recurring theme in this Rh chemistry, is due to a close energy matching between corresponding Rh(i) and Rh(iii) complexes.

40|$|Electron–nuclei {{coupling}} accompanying excitation {{and relaxation}} processes {{is a fascinating}} phenomenon in molecular dynamics. A striking and unexpected example of such coupling is presented here {{in the context of}} photoelectron circular dichroism measurements on randomly oriented, chiral <b>methyloxirane</b> molecules, unaffected by any continuum resonance. Here, we report that the forward-backward asymmetry in the electron angular distribution, with respect to the photon axis, which is associated with photoelectron circular dichroism can surprisingly reverse direction according to the ion vibrational mode excited. This vibrational dependence represents a clear breakdown of the usual Franck–Condon assumption, ascribed to the enhanced sensitivity of photoelectron circular dichroism (compared with other observables like cross-sections or the conventional anisotropy parameter-β) to the scattering phase off the chiral molecular potential, inducing a dependence on the nuclear geometry sampled in the photoionization process. Important consequences for the interpretation of such dichroism measurements within analytical contexts are discussed...|$|E

Deuterium distribution revealed details of transformation pathways. It was found the main reaction channel, where deuterium exchange does not occur, involves exclusively the Lewis sites at the potential exchange sites. For deuterium exchange to occur during ring opening at least one Brønsted site is necessary. For dimerization when deuterium exchange takes place many active site combinations may be envisaged, however, {{for the formation of}} the dioxolane derivatives two neighbouring Brønsted-Lewis site pairs, while for the formation of dioxane derivatives the interplay of one Brønsted-Lewis acid pair and a Lewis-Lewis acid pair seem to be the most advantageous...|$|E

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been carried out for bromochlorofluoromethane, <b>methyloxirane,</b> and epichlorhydrin. The results indicate that solvent effects on the ROA differential scattering intensities can be substantial, and vary in sign and magnitude for different vibrational modes. It is demonstrated that both direct and indirect effects are important in determining the total solvent effects on the ROA differential scattering intensities. Local field effects are shown to be in general small, whereas electronic nonequilibrium solvation has a profound effect on the calculated solvent effects compared to an equilibrium solvation model.

In the particular case of <b>methyloxirane,</b> oligomers are formed in addition to high molecular weight polyethers. An alkoxide-alcohol exchange reaction has proved to be an efficient way to form oligomers preferentially, when the monomer-alcohol molar ratio is small. Upon increasing this ratio, formation of high MW chains occurs increasingly. The use of Ti instead of Al in Al, Zn -oxo-n-butoxide in the presence for phenoxyethanol as a co-initiator inhibits formation of exceedingly long polyether chains and the chain length is basically controlled by the monomer to all potential initiating species molar ratio until MW of ca. 6000. Substitution of phenoxyethanol by polypropylene glycol has led to oligomers of a monomodal MW distribution and a MW of 13, 000.

Solvent effects are included using the polarizable continuum model (PCM). DFT/PCM calculations of sodium D line specific rotations, [R]D, {{have been carried out}} for seven conformationally rigid chiral organic molecules (fenchone, camphor, R-pinene, -pinene, camphorquinone, verbenone, and <b>methyloxirane)</b> for a diverse set of seven solvents (cyclohexane, carbon tetrachloride, benzene, chloroform, acetone, methanol, and acetonitrile). The predicted variation in [R]D for the solvents cyclohexane, acetone, methanol, and acetonitrile are in excellent agreement with experiment for all seven molecules. For the solvents carbon tetrachloride, benzene, and chloroform, agreement is much poorer. Since only electrostatic solute-solvent interactions are included in the PCM, our results lead to the conclusion that, for the seven molecules studied, in cyclohexane, acetone, methanol, and acetonitrile electrostatic effects are dominant while in carbon tetrachloride, benzene, and chloroform other nonelectrostatic effects are more important.

Vibrationally-resolved photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) measurements of the outermost orbital ionization reveal unanticipated large fluctuations in {{the magnitude of the}} forward-backward electron scattering asymmetry, including even a complete reversal of direction. Identification and assignment of the vibrational excitations is supported by Franck-Condon simulations of the photoelectron spectra. A previously proposed quasi-diatomic model for PECD is developed and extended to treat polyatomic systems. The parametric dependence of the electronic dipole matrix elements on nuclear geometry is evaluated in the adiabatic approximation, and provokes vibrational level dependent shifts in amplitude and phase, to which the chiral photoelectron angular distributions are especially sensitive. It is shown that single quantum excitation of those vibrational modes which experience only a relatively small displacement of the ion equilibrium geometry along the normal coordinate, and which are then only weakly excited in the Franck-Condon limit, can be accompanied by big shifts in scattering phase; hence the observed big fluctuations in PECD asymmetry for such modes...|$|E
