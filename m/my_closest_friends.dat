Former Vanderbilt quarterback Tommy Henderson said after learning of Cody's death: Josh was one of <b>my</b> <b>closest</b> <b>friends</b> until he went to Temple. After that I'm afraid we lost contact. He had a lasting influence on the men who played for him. He was kind and considerate but demanding, too. He was a fine defensive basketball coach who believed in aggressive defensive fundamentals. In football, he was respected for what he knew and what he could do with his material." ...|$|E

The Jay-Z-collaboration is a critique on the hip hop industry, its detrimental effects, and {{the trappings of}} being an artist: [...] "While all <b>my</b> <b>closest</b> <b>friends</b> out partyin'/ I'm just here makin' the music that they party to," [...] while Jay-Z gives advice: [...] "Drake, here's how they gonna come at you / with silly rap feuds, trying to distract you." [...] Jay-Z expands on the album's overarching theme of self-doubt: [...] "And since no good deed go unpunished / I'm not as cool with niggaz as I once was / I once was cool as the Fonz was / But these bright lights turned me to a monster." [...] "Miss Me" [...] has Lil Wayne rapping jokes, including a crude punch line about sucking [...] "the brown" [...] off his penis and subsequently groaning, [...] "Ewwww, that's nasty." [...] "Cece's Interlude" [...] has a Prince-like LinnDrum and transparent lyrics addressing a girl: [...] "I wish I / Wasn't famous / I wish I / Was still in school / So that I could have you in my dorm room / I would put it on you crazy."

500|$|As an {{openly gay}} man {{throughout}} his career, Sylvester {{came to be}} seen as a spokesman for the gay community. He informed a journalist that [...] "I realize that gay people have put me on a pedestal and I love it. After all, of all the oppressed minorities, they just have to be the most oppressed. They have all the hassles of finding something or someone to identify with [...] and they chose me. I like being around gay people and they've proven to be some of <b>my</b> <b>closest</b> <b>friends</b> and most loyal audiences." [...] Elsewhere, he nevertheless remarked that he felt his career had [...] "transcended the gay movement. I mean, my sexuality has nothing to do with my music. When I'm fucking I'm not thinking about singing and vice versa." [...] He was openly critical of what he perceived as divisive tendencies within the gay community itself, noting that [...] "I get this conformist shit from queens all the time. They always want to read me. They always want me to do it their way. I am not going to conform to the gay lifestyle as they see it and that's for sure". He was particularly critical of [...] "clones" [...] gay men who dressed alike with boots, boot-cut jeans, checked shirts and handlebar mustaches [...] stating that all too often they judged those gay people who were flamboyant or extravagant.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the death}} of their daughter, Van became {{increasingly}} reclusive; Crosby never spoke publicly about being a mother, aside from mentioning it in a few interviews towards the end of her life: [...] "Now I am going to tell you of something that only <b>my</b> <b>closest</b> <b>friends</b> know. I became a mother and knew a mother's love. God gave us a tender babe but the angels came down and took our infant up to God and to His throne".

She got her first taste of singing solo at a fire hall, where she soaked up the crowd's appreciation. [...] "Sometimes I think that I cheated my own family and <b>my</b> <b>closest</b> <b>friends</b> by giving to audiences so much of the love I might have kept for them. But that's the way I was made; I truly don't think I could help it." [...] (p.20) Martin's craft was developed by seeing movies and becoming a mimic. She would win prizes for looking, acting and dancing like Ruby Keeler and singing exactly like Bing Crosby. [...] "Never, never, never can I say I had a frustrating childhood. It was all joy. Mother used to say she never had seen such a happy child—that I awakened each morning with a smile. I don't remember that, but I do remember that I never wanted to go to bed, to go to sleep, for fear I'd miss something." [...] (p.20) ...|$|E

60|$|It {{happened}} that <b>my</b> <b>closest</b> <b>friends,</b> aside from Burton, were pupils {{of the public}} school and for that reason I kept my membership in the Adelphian Society which met every Monday evening. My activities there, I find, made up a large part of my life during this second winter. I not only debated furiously, disputing weighty political questions, thus advancing the forensic side of my education, but later in the winter I helped to organize a dramatic company which gave a play {{for the benefit of the}} Club Library.|$|E
6000|$|Marjorie was my all, and I {{could no}} longer endure the tension of her gradual decline. As I watched her fade away, I {{realized}} that <b>my</b> <b>closest</b> <b>friends</b> were becoming reconciled to my bereavement, with the philosophical fortitude of spectators. When I was coolly advised [...] "not to sacrifice pecuniary interests for the sentiment of a hopeless experiment," [...] an outraged love grew strong and defiant. The calculating counsel, so cruel and unexpected, strengthened, at last, the timid resolution. Even the silent walls of my house oppressed, while an absolute hatred of the machinery of life seized my tired soul. I determined to be free at any price. Fresh courage entered my life, and impelled me to remove, without a pang, most cherished household gods. My relief was immoderate when everything was gone. Then I experienced {{for the first time}} in years the sweet exhilaration that welcomes, breathlessly, a change. In my dreams I had apparitions of purple mountains, and long quiet days purified with sunshine. Suddenly, into my sad life there came new hope, kindled, it seemed, from the very ashes of an abortive past.|$|E
