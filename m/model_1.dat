A Type 93 passive hydrophone system {{would have been}} fitted in the bow. The ships were designed to carry three aircraft on a platform between the funnel and the mainmast. These would have consisted of one three-seat Aichi E13A and two two-seat Yokosuka E14Y floatplanes. They would have been launched by a pair of aircraft catapults, one on each side of the aircraft platform.|$|E
5|$|Sega also {{experienced}} success with arcade games. In 1992 and 1993, the company's new Sega <b>Model</b> <b>1</b> arcade system board showcased Sega AM2's Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter (the first 3D fighting game), which {{played a crucial}} role in popularizing 3D polygonal graphics. In particular, Virtua Fighter garnered praise for its simple three-button control scheme, with the game's strategy coming from the intuitively observed differences between characters that felt and acted differently rather than the more ornate combos of two-dimensional competitors. Despite its crude visuals—with characters composed of fewer than 1,200 polygons—Virtua Fighters fluid animation and relatively realistic depiction of distinct fighting styles gave its combatants a lifelike presence considered impossible to replicate with sprites. The <b>Model</b> <b>1</b> was an expensive system board, and bringing home releases of its games to the Genesis required more than its hardware could handle. Several alternatives helped to bring Sega's newest arcade games to the console, such as the Sega Virtua Processor chip used for Virtua Racing, and eventually the Sega 32X add-on.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{returned}} home in 1943 {{and began to}} lay defensive minefields in 1944. She was moderately damaged by a mine in April 1945 and struck an American mine two months later. By this time, her armament had been augmented with approximately ten 25mm Type 96 AA guns in single mounts and 80 depth charges. In addition Tokiwa was fitted with Type 3, Mark 1, Model 3 and Type 2, Mark 2, <b>Model</b> <b>1</b> air search radars. While in northern Japan {{a few days before}} the end of the war, Tokiwa was severely damaged by American carrier aircraft and had to be beached by her crew lest she sink.|$|E

5|$|The two initial, primary {{computers}} on the HST {{were the}} 1.25MHz DF-224 system, built by Rockwell Autonetics, which contained three redundant CPUs, and two redundant NSSC-1 (NASA Standard Spacecraft Computer, <b>Model</b> <b>1)</b> systems, developed by Westinghouse and GSFC using diode-transistor logic (DTL). A co-processor for the DF-224 was added during Servicing Mission 1 in 1993, {{which consisted of}} two redundant strings of an Intel-based 80386 processor with an 80387 math co-processor. The DF-224 and its 386 co-processor were replaced by a 25MHz Intel-based 80486 processor system during Servicing Mission 3A in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Development of the Saturn {{began in}} 1992, {{the same year}} Sega's {{groundbreaking}} 3D <b>Model</b> <b>1</b> arcade hardware debuted. Designed around a new CPU from Japanese electronics company Hitachi, another video display processor was incorporated into the system's design in early 1994 to better compete with Sony's forthcoming PlayStation. The Saturn was initially successful in Japan, but failed to sell in large numbers in the United States after its surprise May 1995 launch, four months before its scheduled release date. After the debut of the Nintendo 64 in late 1996, the Saturn rapidly lost market share in the U.S., where it was discontinued in 1998. Having sold 9.26 million units worldwide, the Saturn is considered a commercial failure. The failure of Sega's development teams to release a game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, known in development as Sonic X-treme, has been considered {{a factor in the}} console's poor performance.|$|E

25|$|The United States Department of the Treasury has {{published}} model IGAs which follow two approaches. Under <b>Model</b> <b>1,</b> financial {{institutions in the}} partner country report information about U.S. accounts to the tax authority of the partner country.

Under Model 2, partner country financial institutions report directly to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, and the partner country agrees to lower any legal barriers to that reporting. Model 2 is available in two versions: 2A with no Tax Information Exchange Agreement (TIEA) or Double Tax Convention (DTC) required, and 2B for countries with a pre-existing TIEA or DTC. The agreements generally require parliamentary approval in the countries they are concluded with, but the United States is not pursuing ratification of this as a treaty.|$|E

25|$|Sega {{chose this}} {{processor}} {{for most of}} its arcade games in the 1990s; the Sega System 32 and Sega <b>Model</b> <b>1</b> architectures both used this as their main CPU. (The latter used the lower-cost μPD70615 variant, which doesn't implement V20/V30 emulation.) The V60 was also used as the main CPU in the SSV arcade architecture—so named because it was developed together by Seta, Sammy, and Visco. Sega originally considered using a 16-MHz V60 as the basis for its Sega Saturn console, but after receiving word of the PlayStation's processor (R3000A at 33.8MHz) instead chose the dual-SH-2 design for the eventual production model.|$|E

25|$|Japanese WW2 sonars {{operated}} at a {{range of}} frequencies. The Type 91, with 30 inch quartz projector, worked at 9kHz. The Type 93, with smaller quartz projectors, operated at 17.5kHz (model 5 at 16 or 19kHz magnetostrictive) at powers between 1.7 and 2.5 kilowatts, with range of up to 6km. The later Type 3, with German-design magnetostrictive transducers, operated at 13, 14.5, 16, or 20kHz (by model), using twin transducers (except <b>model</b> <b>1</b> which had three single ones), at 0.2 to 2.5 kilowatts. The Simple type used 14.5kHz magnetostrictive transducers at 0.25kW, driven by capacitive discharge instead of oscillators, with range up to 2.5km.|$|E
25|$|The 'Camel' may be {{regarded}} as the prototype of the Consolidated response to the USAAS's 1924 requirement for a new primary trainer. In the early summer of 1924, the USAAS tested a prototype unofficially designated TW-8 and placed an order for 50 examples of the Consolidated <b>Model</b> <b>1</b> production variant for service with the designation PT-1. Early production models had flat dorsal turtledecks, soon replaced by a faired version, and some of the first ones were likely built at the Gallaudet plant in Norwich before production began at Buffalo. The first 171 of the 221 produced used a streamlined nose radiator, the remainder used the unfaired installation. One PT-1 airframe was completed as XPT-2 with a 220hp (164kW) Wright J-5 radial engine.|$|E
25|$|During the 1850s and 1860s, Rollin White {{had been}} {{permanently}} {{trying to keep}} control on his breech-loading system patent, bringing a lawsuit to any breech-loaded manufactured gun.

But the Colt's company itself was prevented by American laws from infringing the Rollin White patent and all along the 1850s and 1860s continued manufacturing percussion guns. In 1860 it produced a new revolver model for the United States Army. This Colt Army Model 1860 appeared {{just in time for}} the American Civil War.|$|E
