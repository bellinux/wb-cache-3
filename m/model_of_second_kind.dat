40|$|This work {{presents}} three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations {{with the}} fully parallel GAGDET 2 code, to model a rotating source that emits wind {{in order to}} study the subsequent dynamics of the wind in three independent scenarios. In the first scenario we consider several <b>models</b> <b>of</b> the wind source, which {{is characterized by a}} rotation velocity Vrot and an escape velocity Vesc, so that the models have a radially outward wind velocity magnitude Vrad given by 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 times Vrot. In the second scenario, we study the interaction of winds emitted from a binary system in two kinds of models: one in which the source remains during the wind emission and a second one in which all the source itself becomes wind. In the third scenario we consider the interaction of a rotating source that emits wind within a collapsing and rotating core. In this scenario we consider only wind <b>models</b> <b>of</b> the <b>second</b> <b>kind</b> built over a new initial radial mesh, such that the angular velocity of the wind Ωw is 1, 100, and 1000 times the angular velocity of the core Ωc...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{simulation}} programs {{describe the}} reality with different levels <b>of</b> detail: <b>models</b> <b>of</b> territorial planning are essentially macroscopic (flow - variable), {{those for the}} design are microscopic (flow kinetic characteristic - variable). Study of the intersections requires <b>models</b> <b>of</b> this <b>second</b> <b>kind.</b> On roundabout, {{with at least two}} lanes, four are conditions of circulation: immission in flow, circulation on the ring with other vehicles, change of lane (to right or to left) and leaving intersection. Each of these conditions requires an interpretation model that must indicates what measurable greatness (speed, accelerations, gap, lag and so on) could link to drivers behaviour and what are variations of these for different flow conditions. Into intersection each driver is to operate successively in the four flow conditions shown. From this sequence is obtained the microsimulation <b>model</b> as link <b>of</b> partial submodels. As more they are accurate so many good the full program will work. For study the shown manoeuvrings has been realized a first survey on three different intersections with similar geometric characteristics, with different circulation conditions (variable flows) and with different drivers customs (the roundabouts are in two regions). The data acquisition, extraction and next analysis has furnished necessary indications to define some behavioural models. For available space in this paper is showed only an immission model: it have been tested and has given results in line with the surveys...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} energy {{transport}} and fluctuations in simple <b>models</b> <b>of</b> fragile matter : a unique {{state of matter}} that has a vanishingly small window of linear response since {{one or both of}} its elastic moduli (shear and bulk) are nearly zero. As a consequence, even the tiniest perturbations travel as nonlinear waves. In addition, most <b>models</b> <b>of</b> fragile matter have an amorphous structure. It is the interaction of the non-linear waves with the underlying disorder and the resulting fluctuations, that constitutes the unifying theme explored in this thesis. There are at least two seemingly distinct sources of fragility: a local source stemming from the strongly non-linear interaction potential between particles so that one can not expand around a potential minimum to define a spring constant, and a second, global source, whereby the collective response of the sample can be considered weakly linear. As a <b>model</b> <b>of</b> the first kind, we consider a two dimensional packing of soft frictionless elastic disks that are just touching their nearest neighbours. The interaction potential between elastic disks is given by the nonlinear Hertz law that has no harmonic part. Consequently, for a packing in this state, the bulk modulus is vanishingly small and the smallest compressions imparted at the edges leads to nonlinear solitary like waves. As a <b>model</b> <b>of</b> the <b>second</b> <b>kind,</b> we consider a two dimensional random network of harmonic springs where each node has on average around four nearest neighbours. Here, despite the contact interaction being harmonic, the network has a vanishingly small shear modulus. Consequently, even the tiniest shear strains elicit non-linear waves. There are many important similarities and differences between the nature of non-linear waves and the role played by disorder in the two models described above, which we are gradually beginning to understand.

40|$|A {{data model}} {{provides}} a formalism {{consisting of a}} notation for describing data of interest and {{of a set of}} operations for manipulating these data. It abstracts from reality and provides a generalized view of data representing a specific and bounded scope of the real world. In the context of databases, a data model describes the organization, that is, the structure, of a database. In the context of complex objects like video, genomic, and multimedia objects, a data model describes a type system consisting of data types, operations, and predicates. Spatial and spatiotemporal data <b>models</b> are <b>of</b> this <b>second</b> <b>kind.</b> A spatial data model is a data model defining the properties of and operations on static objects in space. These objects are described by spatial data types like point (for example, representing the locations of cities in the U. S.), line (for example, describing the ramifications of the Nile Delta), and region (for example, depicting school districts). Operations on spatial data types include, for instance, the geometric intersection, union, and difference of spatial objects, the computation of the length of a line or the area of a region, the test whether two spatial objects overlap or meet, and whether one object is north or southeast of another object. A spatio-temporal data model is a data model representing the temporal evolution of spatial objects over time. These evolutions can be discrete, that is, they happen from time to time (for example, the change of the boundary of a land parcel) or continuous, that is, they happen permanently and smoothly (for example, the devastating trajectory of a hurricane). In the continuous case, one speaks about moving object...|$|R
