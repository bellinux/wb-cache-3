25|$|Fort Bowyer was a {{short-lived}} earthen and stockade fortification that the United States Army erected in 1813 on <b>Mobile</b> <b>Point,</b> {{near the mouth}} of Mobile Bay in Baldwin County, Alabama. The British twice attacked the fort during the War of 1812. The first, unsuccessful attack, took place in September 1814 and led to the British changing their strategy and attacking New Orleans. The second attack, following their defeat at the Battle of New Orleans, was successful. However, it took place in February 1815, after the Treaty of Ghent had been signed but before the news had reached that part of America. Between 1819 and 1834 the United States built a new masonry fortification, Fort Morgan, on the site of Fort Bowyer.|$|E

After Norwegian MV Sage Sky struck a submerged object, Point Verde escorted her to Southwest Pass. The crew of Point Verde used their law enforcement experience after a knife fight aboard MV Ashley Lykes by taking two seamen into custody near Southwest Pass on 26 February 1967.

40|$|Point cloud {{filtering}} is {{an essential}} preprocessing step in 3 D (three-dimensional) LiDAR (light detection and ranging) point cloud processing. The filtering of <b>mobile</b> LiDAR scanning <b>point</b> clouds is much more challenging due to their non-uniform distribution, the large-scale of missing data areas {{and the existence of}} both large size objects and small land features. This paper proposes a new filtering method that combines range constraint, slope constraint and angular position constraint to filter ground surface <b>points</b> from <b>mobile</b> LiDAR <b>point</b> clouds. Firstly, a cylindrical coordinate system (CCS) is established for each block of <b>mobile</b> LiDAR <b>point</b> clouds and three attributes of <b>mobile</b> LiDAR <b>points,</b> i. e., the angular position attribute (AA), longitudinal distance attribute (LA) and range attribute (RA), are computed. Then, the <b>mobile</b> LiDAR <b>point</b> clouds are structured into a grid according to the AA and LA. Finally, the point clouds are filtered by a single cross-section filter (SCSF) using range constraint and slope constraint, followed by a multiple cross-section filter (MCSF) using range constraint and angular position constraint. Five datasets are used to validate the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed new filtering method achieves an average type I error, type II error, and total error of 1. 426 %, 1. 885 %, and 1. 622 %, respectively...|$|R

From the top of an oak tree, Iberville could observe brackish water flowing from a river into the bay. [...] He did not, however, detect the harbor on the northeast side of the island.

The location provided higher ground than Fort Maurepas and provided the additional benefit of allowing closer contact to the Indians and easier observation of the English traders from the Carolinas. The French located the harbor on Massacre Island and named it Port Dauphin. They began moving the settlement from Fort Maurepas in 1702. Since shallow areas caused by silt from the rivers and a treacherous, shifting bar near <b>Mobile</b> <b>Point</b> made navigation by ocean-going vessels extremely dangerous, supplies were offloaded at Port Dauphin and then transported by smaller boats up the Mobile River.|$|E

40|$|Automatic {{extraction}} of road curbs from uneven, unorganized, noisy and massive 3 D point clouds is a challenging task. Existing methods often project 3 D point clouds onto 2 D planes to extract curbs. However, the projection causes loss of 3 D information which degrades {{the performance of}} the detection. This paper presents a robust, accurate and efficient method to extract road curbs from 3 D <b>mobile</b> LiDAR <b>point</b> clouds. Our method consists of two steps: 1) extracting the candidate points of curbs based on the proposed novel energy function and 2) refining the candidate points using the proposed least cost path model. We evaluated our method on a large-scale of residential area (16. 7 GB, 300 million points) and an urban area (1. 07 GB, 20 million <b>points)</b> <b>mobile</b> LiDAR <b>point</b> clouds. Results indicate that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness, accuracy and efficiency. The proposed curb extraction method achieved a completeness of 78. 62 % and a correctness of 83. 29 %. These experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is a promising solution to extract road curbs from <b>mobile</b> LiDAR <b>point</b> clouds...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel mobile access coordinated {{wireless}} sensor network (MC-WSN) architecture for reliable and efficient information exchange. In conventional sensor networks with <b>mobile</b> access <b>points</b> (SENMA), the <b>mobile</b> access <b>points</b> (MAs) traverse the network to collect information directly from individual sensors. While simplifying the routing process, a major limitation with SENMA is that a transmission is made only if an MA visits the corresponding source node; thus, data transmission {{is limited by the}} physical speed of the MAs and the length of their trajectory, resulting in low throughput and huge delay. The proposed MC-WSN architecture resolves this problem and provides an efficient solution for time-sensitive information exchange. In MC-WSN, the delay is effectively managed through hop number control. We analyze the throughput of the network, and show that the throughput of the MC-WSN is independent of the physical speed or the trajectory length of the <b>mobile</b> access <b>point.</b> The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulations...|$|R

For the Gaussian multiple access channel under the total network power constraint, we show that the maximum achievable rate for the Gaussian multiple access channel is O(log 2 d), obeying the same scaling law as the capacity of an Gaussian multiple-input-single-output channel...|$|R

This resulted in the <b>Mobile</b> <b>Point</b> Lighthouse being downgraded to a harbor light, {{at the same time a}} fourth order Fresnel lens was installed.

Mobile clinics {{have been found to be}} instrumental in rendering of health care especially in the rural and semi- rural areas. In the majority of these areas, the mobile clinic is the only source of health care provision at community level. Lack of well developed infrastructure and poor roads contribute to inaccessibility of health care services in rural and semi-rural areas. Health programmes are often of poor quality or offer incomplete services. Factors such as lack of knowledge of available health care services, satisfaction with the quality and range of services provided, and unavailability of the mobile clinic service when there is a health need, can result in the mobile health care clinic being less utilized. The purpose of the study was to address the following question: What are mobile clinic users’ opinions on health care service provision in the Muldersdrift area Gauteng Province? To answer the question three research objectives were formulated. These were to: describe the mobile clinic users’ level of service utilization, to assess their level of knowledge of available health care services and to determine their level of satisfaction with the services provided. To achieve the study objectives, an exploratory, descriptive survey was used as the research design. Three sampling techniques were used in this study.
