40|$|Based on micromagnetic {{simulations}} {{and model}} calculations, we demonstrate that degenerate well and barrier magnon modes can exist concurrently {{in a single}} magnetic waveguide magnetized perpendicularly to the long axis in a broad frequency band, corresponding to copropagating edge and centre spin waves, respectively. The dispersion relations of these magnon modes clearly show that the edge and <b>centre</b> <b>modes</b> possess much different wave characteristics. By tailoring the antenna size, the edge mode can be selectively activated. If the antenna is sufficiently narrow, both the edge and <b>centre</b> <b>modes</b> are excited with considerable efficiency and propagate along the waveguide. By roughening the lateral boundary of the waveguide, {{the characteristics of the}} relevant channel can be easily engineered. Moreover, the coupling of the edge and <b>centre</b> <b>modes</b> can be conveniently controlled by scaling the width of the waveguide. For a wide waveguide with a narrow antenna, the edge and <b>centre</b> <b>modes</b> travel relatively independently in spatially-separate channels, whereas for a narrow strip, these modes strongly superpose in space.

It has been suggested that adverse health effects of airborne particles may scale with airborne particle number, which if correct, focuses attention on the nanoparticle (less than 100 nm) size range which dominates the number count in urban areas. Urban measurements of particle size distributions have tended to show a broadly similar pattern dominated by a <b>mode</b> <b>centred</b> on 20 – 30 nm diameter emitted by diesel engine exhaust. In this paper we report the results of measurements of particle number concentration and size distribution made in a major London park {{as well as on the}} BT Tower, 160 m aloft. These measurements taken during the REPARTEE project (Regents Park and BT Tower experiment) show a remarkable shift in particle size distributions with major losses of the smallest particle class as particles are advected away from the traffic source. In the Park, the traffic related mode at 20 – 30 nm diameter is much reduced with a new mode at < 10 nm. Size distribution measurements also revealed higher number concentrations of sub- 50 nm particles at the BT Tower during days affected by higher turbulence as determined by Doppler Lidar measurements and are indicative of loss of nanoparticles from air aged during less turbulent conditions. These results are suggestive of nanoparticle loss by evaporation, rather than coagulation processes.

In the South Atlantic, two modes are analysed in more detail: the South Atlantic dipole (SAD) <b>mode,</b> with <b>centres</b> at (15 °S, Greenwich longitude) and at (37. 5 °S, 25 °W) and the southwestern South Atlantic (SWSA) <b>mode,</b> with <b>centres</b> at (30 °S, 40 °W) and at the southern midlatitudes. The ENSO and SAD modes are lagged or lead connected depending on the period of analysis. An El Niño (a La Niña) precedes by up to 6 months the establishment of a positive (negative) SAD mode during the 1920 1930 and 1940 1980 periods. Otherwise, a positive (negative) SAD mode precedes by up to 1 year the establishment of a La Niña (El Niño) during the 1975 2000 period. On the other hand, the SWSA is strongly driven by the ENSO. The effects of both the SAD and SWSA modes on the South American rainfall are also discussed on a seasonal basis. In general, the SAD (ENSO) mode has a weak influence on the ENSO-related (SAD-related) rainfall anomalies over South America. On the other hand, in general, the SWSA and ENSO modes have a combined effect on rainfall of the southern and southeastern regions of South America. A particularly important result of the present analysis for climate monitoring and forecasting purposes seems to be the changing relations between the SAD and ENSO modes. Pages: 2008  202...|$|R

These plumes were studied with the DLR (Deutsches Zentrum fuer Luft- und Raumfahrt) research aircraft Falcon which was equipped with an extensive set of in situ aerosol and trace gas instruments. Analyses by the Lagrangian dispersion model FLEXPART provided source regions, transport times and horizontal extent of the fire plumes. Results from the general circulation model ECHAM/MADE and data from previous aerosol studies over Central Europe provided reference vertical profiles of black carbon (BC) mass concentrations for year 2000 conditions with forest fire activities below the long-term average. Smoke plume observations yielded a BC mass fraction of total aerosol mass with respect to PM 2. 5 of 2 – 8 %. The ratio of BC mass to excess CO was 3 – 7. 5 mg BC (g CO) - 1. Even after up to 10 days of atmospheric transport, both characteristic properties were of the same order as for fresh emissions. This suggests an efficient lifting of BC from forest fires to higher altitudes with only minor scavenging removal of particulate matter.

For any azimuthal wavenumber m and axial wavenumber k, {{the frequency of}} these modes is given at leading order by ω 0 =mΩ 0 + kW 0 where Ω 0 and W 0 are the angular and axial velocities of the vortex at its <b>centre.</b> These <b>modes</b> possess a multi-layer structure localized in an O(Re− 1 / 6) neighbourhood of the vortex. By a multiple-scale matching analysis, we demonstrate the existence of three different families of viscous <b>centre</b> <b>modes</b> whose frequency expands as ω(n) ∼ ω 0 + Re− 1 / 3 ω 1 + Re− 1 / 2 ω(n) 2. One of these families is shown to have unstable eigenmodes when H 0 = 2 Ω 0 k(2 kΩ 0 − mW 2) < 0 where W 2 is the second radial derivative of the axial flow in the centre. The growth rate of these modes is given at leading order by σ ∼ (3 / 2) (H 0 / 4) 1 / 3 Re− 1 / 3. Our results prove that any vortex with a jet (or jet with swirl) such that Ω 0 W 2 = 0 is unstable if the Reynolds number is sufficiently large. The spatial structure of the viscous <b>centre</b> <b>modes</b> is obtained and simple approximations which capture the main feature of the eigenmodes are also provided.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{propagation}} of finite bubbles in a Hele-Shaw channel, where a centred occlusion (termed a rail) is introduced to provide a small axially-uniform depth constriction. For bubbles wide enough to span the channel, the system's behaviour {{is similar to that}} of semi-infinite fingers and a symmetric static solution is stable. Here, we focus on smaller bubbles, in which case the symmetric static solution is unstable and the static bubble is displaced towards one of the deeper regions of the channel on either side of the rail. Using a combination of experiments and numerical simulations of a depth-averaged model, we show that a bubble propagating axially due to a small imposed flow rate can be stabilised in a steady symmetric <b>mode</b> <b>centred</b> on the rail through a subtle interaction between stabilising viscous forces and destabilising surface tension forces. However, for sufficiently large capillary numbers Ca, the ratio of viscous to surface tension forces, viscous forces in turn become destabilising thus returning the bubble to an off-centred propagation regime. With decreasing bubble size, the range of Ca for which steady centred propagation is stable decreases, and eventually vanishes through the coalescence of two supercritical pitchfork bifurcations. The depth-averaged model is found to accurately predict all the steady modes of propagation observed experimentally, and provides a comprehensive picture of the underlying steady bifurcation structure. However, for sufficiently large imposed flow rates, we find that initially centred bubbles do not converge onto a steady mode of propagation. Instead they transiently explore weakly unstable steady modes, an evolution which results in their break-up and eventual settling into a steady propagating state of changed topology.

40|$|Particle {{emissions}} from ship engines and their atmospheric {{transformation in the}} marine boundary layer (MBL) were investigated in engine test bed studies and in airborne measurements of expanding ship plumes. During the test rig studies, detailed aerosol microphysical and chemical properties were measured in the exhaust gas of a serial MAN B&W seven-cylinder four-stroke marine diesel engine under various load conditions. The emission studies were complemented by airborne aerosol transformation studies in the plume of a large container ship in the English Channel using the DLR aircraft Falcon 20 E- 5. Observations from emission studies and plume studies combined with a Gaussian plume dispersion model yield a consistent picture of particle transformation processes from emission to atmospheric processing during plume expansion. Particulate matter emission indices obtained from plume measurements are 8. 8 &plusmn; 1. 0 &times; 10 15 (kg fuel) &minus; 1 by number for non-volatile particles and 174 &plusmn; 43 mg (kg fuel) &minus; 1 by mass for Black Carbon (BC). Values determined for test rig conditions between 85 and 110 % engine load are of similar magnitude. For the total particle number including volatile compounds no emission index can be derived since the volatile aerosol fraction is subject to rapid transformation processes in the plume.

It is shown that backscatter coefficient, depolarization-ratio, and lidar ratio vertical profiles represent the best tools to detect the intrusion of long range transported air masses and to monitor their effects on the vertical distribution of aerosol optical and microphysical properties. High resolution radiometers are instead important tools to monitor changes on columnar aerosol properties and size distributions. Backscatter coefficient, depolarization-ratio, and lidar ratio vertical profiles have revealed that aerosol optical and microphysical properties significantly changed with time and space during African dust outbreaks: the intrusion of dust particles that at first occurred above 2 km of altitude extending up to 6 km, affected the all aerosol load down to ground within few hours. Aerosol size distributions showed during dust events a clear bimodality with an accumulation mode maximum at 0. 24 µm and a coarse mode maximum at 0. 94 μm. Conversely, {{we have found that}} during the advection of air masses from the Atlantic and continental Europe, aerosol particles were mainly located below 2 km, their optical and microphysical properties were affected by smaller changes in time and space, and were characterized by depolarization ratios rather close to those due to a pure molecular atmosphere.

Depending on the ratio between updraft velocity and particle number concentration (w/NCN), we found three distinctly different regimes of CCN activation and cloud droplet formation: 1. An aerosol-limited regime that is characterized by high w/NCN ratios (>&#x 2248; 10 &minus; 3 m s&minus; 1 cm 3 ), high maximum values of water vapour supersaturation (Smax&gt;&#x 2248; 0. 5 %), and high activated fractions of aerosol particles (NCD/NCN&gt;&#x 2248; 90 %). In this regime NCD is directly proportional to NCN and practically independent of w. 2. An updraft-limited regime that is characterized by low w/NCN ratios (&minus; 4 m s&minus; 1 cm 3 ), low maximum values of water vapour supersaturation (SmaxNCD/NCNNCD is directly proportional to w and practically independent of NCN. 3. An aerosol- and updraft-sensitive regime, which is characterized by parameter values in between the two other regimes and covers most of the conditions relevant for pyro-convection. In this regime NCD depends non-linearly on both NCN and w. In sensitivity studies we have tested the influence of aerosol particle hygroscopicity on NCD. Within the range of effective hygroscopicity parameters that is characteristic for continental atmospheric aerosols (κ&#x 2248; 0. 05 – 0. 6), we found that NCD depends rather weakly on the actual value of κ.

The corner, edge and <b>centre</b> <b>modes</b> that are often observed in such structures were also observed in these measurements. In addition, novel higher order internal modes were observed and {{were found to be}} well reproduced by theoretical cal- culations using boundary element method (BEM). These modes are 2 ̆ 2 dark modes 2 ̆ 2 so are not observed in the optical extinction spectra. They are confined surface propagating modes and are analogous to laser cavity mode...|$|R
