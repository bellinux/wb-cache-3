5|$|Another {{proposed}} space-related {{application of}} americium is a fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion. It {{relies on the}} very high rate of nuclear fission of 242mAm, which can be maintained even in a micrometer-thick foil. Small thickness avoids the problem of self-absorption of emitted radiation. This problem is pertinent to uranium or plutonium rods, in which only surface layers provide alpha-particles. The fission products of 242mAm can either directly propel the spaceship or they can heat up a thrusting gas; they can also transfer their energy to a fluid and generate electricity through a <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> generator.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that the energy {{necessary}} to heat the corona is provided by turbulent motion in the convection zone below the photosphere, and two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain coronal heating. The first is wave heating, in which sound, gravitational or <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone. These waves travel upward and dissipate in the corona, depositing their energy in the ambient matter {{in the form of}} heat. The other is magnetic heating, in which magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and released through magnetic reconnection in the form of large solar flares and myriad similar but smaller events—nanoflares.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium {{compounds}} {{are sometimes}} used in fireworks {{to give them}} a purple color. Rubidium has also been considered for use in a thermoelectric generator using the <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> principle, where rubidium ions are formed by heat at high temperature and passed through a magnetic field. These conduct electricity and act like an armature of a generator thereby generating an electric current. Rubidium, particularly vaporized 87Rb, {{is one of the most}} commonly used atomic species employed for laser cooling and Bose–Einstein condensation. Its desirable features for this application include the ready availability of inexpensive diode laser light at the relevant wavelength, and the moderate temperatures required to obtain substantial vapor pressures. For cold atom applications requiring tunable interactions, 85Rb is preferable due to its rich Feshbach spectrum.|$|E

25|$|Fission {{fragment}} reactor. A {{fission fragment}} reactor is {{a nuclear reactor}} that generates electricity by decelerating an ion beam of fission byproducts instead of using nuclear reactions to generate heat. By doing so, it bypasses the Carnot cycle and can achieve efficiencies of up to 90% instead of 40–45% attainable by efficient turbine-driven thermal reactors. The fission fragment ion beam would be passed through a <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> generator to produce electricity.|$|E
25|$|Coronal {{seismology}} {{is a new}} way {{of studying}} the plasma of the solar corona with the use of <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> (MHD) waves. Magnetohydrodynamics studies the dynamics of electrically conducting fluids—in this case the fluid is the coronal plasma. Philosophically, coronal seismology is similar to the Earth's seismology, the Sun's helioseismology, and MHD spectroscopy of laboratory plasma devices. In all these approaches, waves of various kinds are used to probe a medium. The potential of coronal seismology in the estimation of the coronal magnetic field, density scale height, fine structure and heating has been demonstrated by different research groups.|$|E

25|$|The sun's corona is much hotter (by {{a factor}} from 150 to 450) than the visible {{surface of the}} Sun: the photosphere's average {{temperature}} is 5800 kelvin compared to the corona's one to three million kelvins. The corona is 10−12 times as dense as the photosphere, and so produces about one-millionth as much visible light. The corona is separated from the photosphere by the relatively shallow chromosphere. The exact mechanism by which the corona is heated is still the subject of some debate, but likely possibilities include induction by the Sun's magnetic field and <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> waves from below. The outer edges of the Sun's corona are constantly being transported away due to open magnetic flux and hence generating the solar wind.|$|E
2500|$|GEM is used {{to study}} {{nonlinear}} physics associated with tokamak plasma turbulence and transport. [...] Tokamak turbulence driven by ion-temperature-gradient modes, electron-temperature gradient modes, trapped electron modes and micro-tearing modes has been investigated using GEM. [...] It is also being used to look at energetic particle driven <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> (see magnetohydrodynamics) eigenmodes.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{historically}} successful combined cycles {{have used}} hot cycles with mercury vapour turbines, <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> generators or molten carbonate fuel cells, with steam plants {{for the low}} temperature [...] "bottoming" [...] cycle. Bottoming cycles operating from a steam condenser's heat exhaust are theoretically possible, but uneconomical because of the very large, expensive equipment needed to extract energy from the small temperature differences between condensing steam and outside air or water. However, it is common in cold climates (such as Finland) to drive community heating systems from a power plant's condenser heat. Such cogeneration systems can yield theoretical efficiencies above 95%.|$|E
2500|$|Nova was a {{high-power}} laser {{built at}} the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in 1984 which conducted advanced inertial confinement fusion (ICF) experiments until its dismantling in 1999. Nova was the first ICF experiment built {{with the intention of}} reaching [...] "ignition", a chain reaction of nuclear fusion that releases a large amount of energy. Although Nova failed in this goal, the data it generated clearly defined the problem as being mostly a result of <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> instability, leading to the design of the National Ignition Facility, Nova's successor. Nova also generated considerable amounts of data on high-density matter physics, regardless of the lack of ignition, which is useful both in fusion power and nuclear weapons research.|$|E
2500|$|In {{this model}} (from 1944) the {{companion}} went nova with ejected material {{captured by the}} Sun and planets forming from this material. In a version a year later it was a supernova. [...] In 1955 he proposed a similar system to Laplace, and with more mathematical detail in 1960. It differs from Laplace in that a magnetic torque occurs between the disk and the Sun, which comes into effect immediately or else more and more matter would be ejected resulting in a much too massive planetary system, one comparable to the Sun. The torque causes a magnetic coupling and acts to transfer angular momentum from the Sun to the disk. The magnetic field strength {{would have to be}} 1 gauss. The existence of torque depends on magnetic lines of force being frozen into the disk (a consequence of a well-known MHD (<b>magnetohydrodynamic)</b> theorem on frozen-in lines of force). As the solar condensation temperature when the disk was ejected could not be much more than 1000 degrees K., a number of refractories must be solid, probably as fine smoke particles, which would grow with condensation and accretion. These particles would be swept out with the disk only if their diameter at the Earth's orbit was less than 1 meter so as the disk moved outward a subsidiary disk consisting of only refractories remains behind where the terrestrial planets would form. The model is in good agreement with the mass and composition of the planets and angular momentum distribution provided the magnetic coupling is an acceptable idea, but not explained are twinning, the low mass of Mars and Mercury, and the planetoid belts. It was Alfvén who formulated the concept of frozen-in magnetic field lines.|$|E
