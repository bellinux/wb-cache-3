60|$|When the sun withdraws {{the sand}} ceases to flow, {{but in the}} morning the streams will start once more and branch and branch again into a myriad of others. You here see perchance how blood-vessels are formed. If you look closely you observe that first there pushes forward from the thawing mass a stream of {{softened}} sand with a drop-like point, like the ball of the finger, feeling its way slowly and blindly downward, until at last with more heat and moisture, as the sun gets higher, the most fluid portion, in its effort to obey the law to which the most inert also yields, separates from the latter and forms for itself a <b>meandering</b> <b>channel</b> or artery within that, in which is seen a little silvery stream glancing like lightning from one stage of pulpy leaves or branches to another, and ever and anon swallowed up in the sand. It is wonderful how rapidly yet perfectly the sand organizes itself as it flows, using the best material its mass affords to form the sharp edges of its channel. Such are the sources of rivers. In the silicious matter which the water deposits is perhaps the bony system, and in the still finer soil and organic matter the fleshy fibre or cellular tissue. What is man but a mass of thawing clay? The ball of the human finger is but a drop congealed. The fingers and toes flow to their extent from the thawing mass of the body. Who knows what the human body would expand and flow out to under a more genial heaven? Is not the hand a spreading palm leaf with its lobes and veins? The ear may be regarded, fancifully, as a lichen, Umbilicaria, {{on the side of the}} head, with its lobe or drop. The lip--labium, from labor (?)--laps or lapses from the sides of the cavernous mouth. The nose is a manifest congealed drop or stalactite. The chin is a still larger drop, the confluent dripping of the face. The cheeks are a slide from the brows into the valley of the face, opposed and diffused by the cheek bones. Each rounded lobe of the vegetable leaf, too, is a thick and now loitering drop, larger or smaller; the lobes are the fingers of the leaf; and as many lobes as it has, in so many directions it tends to flow, and more heat or other genial influences would have caused it to flow yet farther.|$|E

40|$|The {{apparent}} {{increase in}} occurrence of <b>meandering</b> fluvial <b>channel</b> {{systems in the}} Middle Palaeozoic has long been related {{to the effects of}} land-plant colonization. However, evidence for <b>meandering</b> <b>channels</b> in non-vegetated settings is shown by pre-vegetation successions on Earth, from the prevalence of <b>meandering</b> <b>channels</b> on Mars, from physical modelling of <b>meandering</b> <b>channels,</b> and from non-vegetated channels in modern desert basins. In addition, early land plants had small dimensions, were limited in their occurrence, and were dependent on environmental factors. Here, we question the capacity of early land plants to impose the major impacts suggested by current models. We propose that the sudden widespread occurrence on Earth of fluvial deposits indicative of the accumulation of meandering river systems in the Middle Palaeozoic was primarily an effect of environmental and tectonic conditions that prevailed during this period. These conditions induced a worldwide increase in the proportion of meandering rivers, which in turn helped favour the appropriate environment for land-plant colonization of the continents. We propose that land plants opportunistically took advantage of an appropriate global environment, which enabled them to thrive in continental environments. Fluvial environments characterized by single-channel systems and stable floodplains facilitated the greening of the land...|$|R

40|$|Meander {{dynamics}} {{has been}} the focus of river engineering for decades; however, it remains a challenge for researchers to precisely replicate natural evolution processes of <b>meandering</b> <b>channels</b> with numerical models due to the high nonlinearity of the governing equations. The present study puts forward a nonlinear model to simulate the flow pattern and evolution of <b>meandering</b> <b>channels.</b> The proposed <b>meander</b> model adopts the nonlinear hydrodynamic submodel developed by Blanckaert and de Vriend, which accounts for the nonlinear interactions between secondary flow and main flow and therefore has no curvature restriction. With the computational flow field, the evolution process of the channel centerline is simulated using the Bank Erosion and Retreat Model (BERM) developed by Chen and Duan. Verification against two laboratory flume experiments indicates the proposed meander model yields satisfactory agreement with the measured data. For comparison, the same experimental cases are also simulated with the linear version of the hydrodynamic submodel. Calculated results show that the flow pattern and meander evolution process predicted by the nonlinear and the linear models are similar for mildly curved channels, whereas they exhibit different characteristics when channel sinuosity becomes relatively high. It is indicated that the nonlinear interactions between main flow and secondary flow prevent the growth of the secondary flow and induce a more uniform transverse velocity profile in high-sinuosity channels, which slows down the evolution process of <b>meandering</b> <b>channels...</b>|$|R
25|$|However, the {{critical}} factor that determines whether a stream will meander or braid is bank erodibility. A stream with cohesive banks that {{are resistant to}} erosion will form narrow, deep, <b>meandering</b> <b>channels,</b> whereas a stream with highly erodible banks will form wide, shallow channels, sustaining helical flow and resulting {{in the formation of}} braided channels.|$|R
40|$|During {{uniform flow}} in open {{channels}} {{the resistance to}} the flow is dependant {{on a number of}} flow and channel parameters. The usual practice in one dimensional analysis is to select a value of n depending on the channel surface roughness and take it as uniform for the entire surface for all depths of flow. The influences of all the parameters are assumed to be lumped into a single value of n. The larger the value of n, the higher is the loss of energy within the flow. Although much research has been done on Manning's n, for straight channels, very little has been done concerning the roughness values for simple <b>meandering</b> <b>channels.</b> An investigation concerning the variation of roughness coefficients with for simple <b>meandering</b> <b>channels</b> with slope, sinuosity and geometry are presented.

NPS also removed invasive, non-native vegetation in the riparian corridor, and replaced it with native vegetation to enhance nesting habitat for resident and migrant riparian songbirds.

50|$|The largest {{tributary}} of the Sence is the Saint, with a headwater called the Tweed rising near Barwell (GR SP435961; alt. 125 m) and on Barwell Lane (GR 438957; alt. 115 m). A branch from Hinckley (GR SP429951; alt. ca 125 m) joins the Tweed south-west of Stapleton, south of Harper’s Hill. The Tweed runs west almost to Dadlington, whence it is canalized north-west to the confluence with Stapleton Brook. It then runs west along the foot of Ambion Hill. It gains a stream from between Higham on the Hill and Wykin running north and another from Lindley running north-east and turns north to Shenton, where it joins a smaller stream running west from Cadeby (GR SK429020; alt. 128 m) to become the Saint flowing westwards. A large stream from the north rises west of Market Bosworth and north-west of Hoo Hills, Wellsborough, passing the Bosworth hamlet of Far Coton to join the Saint on Upton Ridge. Thence the Saint continues west to Sibson and meanders to the Sence between Sheepy and Ratcliffe Culey (GR SK326999). In general, its course from Barwell to Ratcliffe covers about 13 km, in which it falls about 50 m, a gradient of about 1:650, resulting in a slower flow than of the Sence, and a muddy, marshy and more <b>meandering</b> <b>channel</b> than the Sence. Only across the Upton-Linley north-south ridge between Shenton and Sibson is its flow faster.|$|E
40|$|Studies {{were carried}} out to {{understand}} the effect of floodplain roughness on flow structures, sediment transport rates and bedforms in a mobile <b>meandering</b> <b>channel</b> with overbank flows. Three floodplain roughnesses were examined in this study. Flow structures and bedforms were measured using a three component laser Doppler anemometer (LDA) system and digital photogrammetry, respectively. Comparisons of flow structures and bedforms between different floodplain rougheness are made. Considerable changes in the flow structure and bed form were observed. In particular, multiple secondary flow cells along the <b>meandering</b> <b>channel</b> occur at deeper water depths as the floodplain roughness increases.
