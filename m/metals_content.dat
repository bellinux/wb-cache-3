40|$|Abstract. Heavy <b>metals</b> <b>content</b> {{as well as}} {{magnetic}} {{and electrical}} properties of leachate from Sarimukti, West Java were studied {{in an attempt to}} seek correlation between heavy <b>metals</b> <b>content</b> and magnetic/electrical properties. Such correlation is expected to open the way for the use of magnetic/electrical properties as proxy indicators for the concentration of heavy metals in the leachate. The number of leachate samples studied is 21; 15 were taken spatially at depth of 1 m while the remaining 6 samples were taken vertically at a particular point. Measurement results showed that the heavy <b>metals</b> <b>content</b> in the leachate has a smaller concentration, except for Fe. The correlation between magnetic susceptibility and heavy <b>metals</b> <b>content</b> was found to be not so significant. The best correlation coefficient between magnetic susceptibility with heavy metals in leachate was found in Zn. Correlation between electrical conductivity and heavy metal is also not so significant, except for Zn and Cd. The use of magnetic properties as proxy indicator for heavy <b>metals</b> <b>content</b> in leachate is plausible provided that the magnetic susceptibility exceeds certain threshold value. Correlation between magnetic susceptibility, electrical conductivity and heavy metal content would be good if each quantity has a large value...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} the metal flow in a municipal solid waste (MSW) management system. Outputs of a resource recovery facility, refuse derived fuel (RDF) production facility, carbonization facility, plastics liquefaction facility, composting facility, and bio-gasification facility were analyzed for <b>metal</b> <b>content</b> and leaching concentration. In terms of <b>metal</b> <b>content,</b> bulky and incombustible waste had the highest values.

A leaching test revealed that Cd and Pb in char and Pb in RDF production residue exceeded the Japanese regulatory criteria for landfilling, so special attention should be paid to final disposal of these substances. By multiplying <b>metal</b> <b>content</b> and the generation rate of outputs, the <b>metal</b> <b>content</b> of input waste to each facility was estimated. For most metals except Cr, the total contribution ratio of paper/textile/plastics, bulky waste, and incombustible waste was over 80 %. Approximately 30 % of Cr originated from plastic packaging.

For those reasons, a comparative study was done between soil cores and sediments taken from two locations in the Qaraaoun reservoir, Lebanon. The soil cores were partitioned into several layers. Each layer was analyzed for several physicochemical parameters, such as functional groups, particle size distribution, ζ-potential, texture, pH, electric conductivity, total dissolved solids, organic matter, cation exchange capacity, active and total calcareous, available sodium and potassium, and <b>metal</b> <b>content</b> (cadmium, copper, and lead). The <b>metal</b> <b>content</b> of each site was linked to soil composition and characteristics. The two sites showed distinguishable characteristics for features such as organic matter, pH, mineral fraction, calcareous, and <b>metal</b> <b>content.</b> The samples taken toward the south site (Q 1), though con- tain lower organic matter than the other but are more calcareous, showed higher <b>metal</b> <b>content</b> {{in comparison to the}} other site (Q 2) (average <b>metal</b> <b>content</b> ofQ 1 > Q 2; for Cd 3. 8 > 1. 8 mg/kg, Cu 28. 6 > 21. 9 mg/kg, Pb 26. 7 > 19 mg/kg).

The distribution of PGE-bearing phases is heterogenous, as in previously published datasets of lithospheric mantle from the Kaapvaal and other cratons.
