40|$|Abstract The thesis Approach of a Medical Rescuer to Acute Intoxication in Pre Hospital Care {{consists}} of a theoretical part and a research part. I mention the history of <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> and describe {{the work of a}} medical rescuer in the introduction of the theoretical part. Acute intoxication, ways and causes of its occurrence and subsequent therapy is the main topic of my thesis. As the issue of intoxication is very extensive I focused on the most frequent types of intoxication that medical rescuers might face within the interventions of <b>Medical</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>Service</b> and their therapy in pre hospital care. My thesis set a goal to find out whether medical rescuers had sufficient theoretical knowledge and practical experience in the field of acute intoxication. I used the quantitative data collection method in the form of anonymous questionnaires designed for medical rescuers in the South Bohemia region for the research. I set a hypothesis that medical rescuers had sufficient theoretical knowledge and the most significant practical experience in intoxication with alcohol. The returned questionnaires showed that the hypotheses I had set were confirmed. I would like my thesis to be beneficial for medical rescuers in the field of information on acute intoxication...|$|E

40|$|Current {{situation}} and educational prospects of paramedics This Bachelor paper endeavors {{to investigate the}} current {{situation and}} educational prospects of paramedics, i. e. medically trained rescuers. This topic has recently been much discussed, since {{a great number of}} young people are being trained and will be trained to become paramedics, and they should have a clear idea of what the qualification they wish to acquire or have already acquired can bring them. The theoretical section of the paper addresses both the historical development and the current situation encountered in the emergency pre-hospital care as provided in the Czech Republic, with the focus on the Emergency Medical Service of the South Bohemian Region (ZZS JčK), whose staff members constituted the surveyed sample. The theory of the subject gives a legal definition of paramedics and specifies their options of professional training & education. The paper aimed to map the employment possibilities of paramedics at ZZS JčK and {{to find out what the}} ZZS JčK staff thought about the prospects of this profession. The survey relied on the method of qualitative research based on the questionnaire technique. As follows from the results obtained, all the paramedics being trained cannot currently find a job with the <b>Medical</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>Service,</b> but in case an Act on Emergency Medical Service is passed, new Emergency Centers will crop up and more paramedics will be needed. As regards the prospects of career for the paramedics, the employees of the <b>Medical</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>Service</b> are optimistic, because in case the Service cannot offer them a job, they will be able to find employment elsewhere. Thus the hypothesis envisaging that with the number of trained paramedics growing their prospects of finding a job with the Service will diminish proved partly true. The second hypothesis expecting that the paramedic qualification brings better prospects for males than for females was not confirmed as true. Other results of the survey lead me to recommend that the paramedic training takes on a different form and different length, since most respondents believed the paramedics, on leaving the vocational training, were not completely ready for the field work...|$|E

40|$|Under {{conditions}} of extreme and life-threatening stress, people often report dis-tortions of time. These distortional experiences are critical since, axiomatically, they occur in circumstances where small variations in behavior {{can mean the}} difference between survival and extinction. The present work examines the spectrum of evidence concerning such phenomena including observations from real-world events such as combat, ejection from high-performance aircraft, driv-ing in dangerous environments and from less stressful, yet informative laboratory procedures. A contextual theory is promulgated which postulates that in addition to draining attentional resources, stress prevents the efficient production of such resources. The stress-depleted resources which remain are directed to task-relevant activities and consequently attention to time-based cues is minimized resulting in distortion effects for both time-in-passing and for time recollection in memory. A number of practical observations are advanced concerning the performance of professionals who are likely to meet such conditions in their occupations including those in aerospace, military, fire-fighting, law enforcement, and <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> operations. In conclusion, we present a number of future research strategies that may be enacted in order to evaluate this ephemeral, real-world phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} process {{modeling}} of a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) channel, {{according to the}} Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) rules, {{in order to build}} a balanced scorecard (BSC). The Fire department in the Bouches-du-Rhône (SDIS) and the <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>service</b> have coordinated their action and processes with hospitals to set up this kind of specific channel to deal with strokes. According to Hankey and Warlow (1999), each year in a population of 1 million inhabitants of a developed country, 2 400 patients use a care institution because of this pathology. As the window of opportunity for treatment is only 4 hours from first symptoms, swiftness is needed in both diagnosis and intervention. This emphasizes the fluidity of the channel, and thus the coordination of actors, as key success factors. This work upon process modeling is a source of lessons {{on the role of the}} information system in organizational innovation in the public services and the required capabilities to be mastered. But it mainly allows us to bring out the relevant indicators to build up the monitoring part of the balance scorecard (BSC) and to propose a roadmap to implement such a method for equivalent medical channels. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the effects of traumatic experience from extraordinary events on psychosomatic manifestations in members of the Integrated Rescue System (IRS). Psychosomatic manifestations are caused by interactions between the soul and the body, i. e. effects of the physical condition on the mental condition and vice versa. The effects are also interconnected with the social environment of the afflicted person. It is therefore necessary to take care of all the so-called biopsychosocial human needs. The theoretical part describes psychosomatics as a discipline. It {{deals with the}} symptoms, general psychotherapy and historical development of psychosomatics. Further, it discusses the possibility of crisis intervention and specific risks of activities performed by the individual IRS components. The practical part of the thesis monitored the effects of traumatic experiences on members of the Fire Rescue Service corps, <b>Medical</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>Service</b> and Police of the Czech Republic. The aim was to determine the gravity of this problem and to jointly find possible solutions. The results have shown show that there is a certain level of negative impact and therefore it is important to focus on preventive measures to avoid serious complications...|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} my {{bachelor}} degree work is ``Competences of a paramedic {{in an ambulance}} crew``. One of {{the objectives of the}} work was to discover opinions of doctors and paramedics regarding the competences of a paramedic in an ambulance crew. The other objective was to map out the situation in individual stations of emergency services in South Bohemia. In the theoretical portion of the work I focused on various aspects of the medical emergency services such as their origin, characteristics and activities. Further on I described the job of a paramedic as regards the education, activities and legal responsibilities related to this job. In the practical portion of the work I chose the method of quantitative research. To gather data I used a questionnaire and a knowledge test. The inquired group comprised doctors and paramedics working in ambulance stations of the South-Bohemian <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>service.</b> With regards to the objective of the work I determined three hypotheses. The first hypothesis assumed that ``Most paramedics consider their competences insufficient because of their education``. The second hypothesis assumed that ``Most doctors consider paramedics´ competences sufficient. `` The third hypothesis said that ``Most paramedics have sufficient professional knowledge about the scope of their competences``. The research confirmed two of the hypotheses. The one mentioned as second was not confirmed.

40|$|Threshold {{values are}} of prime {{importance}} {{in providing a}} sound basis for public health decisions. A key issue is determining threshold or maximum exposure values for pollutants and assessing their potential health risks. Environmental epidemiology could be instrumental in assessing these levels, especially since the assessment of ambient exposures involves relatively low concentrations of pollutants. This paper presents a statistical method that allows the determination of threshold values {{as well as the}} assessment of the associated risk using a retrospective, longitudinal study design with a prospective follow-up. Morbidity data were analyzed using the Fourier method, a time-series analysis that {{is based on the assumption}} of a high temporal resolution of the data. This method eliminates time-dependent responses like temporal inhomogeneity and pseudocorrelation. The frequency of calls for respiratory distress conditions to the regional Mobile <b>Medical</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>Service</b> (MMES) in the city of Leipzig were investigated. The entire population of Leipzig served as a pool for data collection. In addition to the collection of morbidity data, air pollution measurements were taken every 30 min for the entire study period using sulfur dioxide as the regional indicator variable. This approach allowed the calculation of a dose-response curve for respiratory diseases and air pollution indices in children and adults. Significantly higher morbidities were observed above a 24 -hr mean value of 0. 6 mg SO 2 /m 3 air for children and 0. 8 mg SO 2 /m 3 for adults. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
