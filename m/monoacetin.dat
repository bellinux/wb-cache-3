40|$|A {{series of}} {{polypyrrole}} supported WO 3 were fabricated and characterized by FT-IR, XRD, XPS, BET, TGA, and FESEM-EDX. The {{activity of the}} catalysts was tested in glycerol esterification with acetic acid, and it found that WO 3 -Ppy- 20 (nanocomposite with 20 % WO 3 loaded) showed the maximum catalyst activity with 98 % and selectivity of 70 % to triacetin at 110 °C with a reaction duration of 10 [*]h and also recorded the highest selectivity (75 %) for acetylation of glycerol to <b>monoacetin</b> with about 59 % conversion only. The highest acidity of WO 3 -Ppy- 20 is also confirmed using TPD-NH 3 analysis. The activity and selectivity to triacetin of the catalyst were enhanced by increasing WO 3 loading amount, resulting in 82 % conversion for WO 3 -Ppy- 5 with about 32 and 50 % selectivity to <b>monoacetin</b> and diacetin and about 18 % selectivity to triacetin; in case of WO 3 -Ppy- 20, these amounts were changed to 5, 25, and 70 % selectivity to <b>monoacetin,</b> diacetin, and triacetin, respectively with the conversion of 98 %. TPD-NH 3 analysis found that polypyrrole supported WO 3 increases the catalyst acidity of WO 3. BET and FESEM analyses revealed that WO 3 particles were well dispersed with the smallest average size in nanocomposite compared to pure WO 3, which could contribute to the high activity of WO 3 -Ppy catalyst for esterification of glycerol...|$|E
40|$|Transesterification of {{glycerol}} with {{ethyl acetate}} was performed over acidic catalysts in the batch and semi-batch systems. Ethyl acetate {{was used as}} reactant and entrainer to remove the produced ethanol during the reaction, through azeotrope formation. Since the azeotrope of ethyl acetate and ethanol forms at 70 oC, all the experiments were performed at this temperature. Para-toluene sulfonic acid, sulfuric acid, and Amberlyst 36 were used as catalyst. The effect of process parameters including ethyl acetate to glycerol molar ratio (6 - 12), reaction time (3 - 9 h), and the catalyst to glycerol weight (2. 5 - 9. 0 %), on the conversion and products selectivities were investigated. Under reflux conditions, 100 % glycerol conversion was obtained with 45 %, 44 %, and 11 % selectivity to <b>monoacetin,</b> diacetin, and triacetin, respectively. Azeotropic reactive distillation led to 100 % conversion of glycerol with selectivities of 3 %, 48 % and 49 % for <b>monoacetin,</b> diacetin, and triacetin. During the azeotropic reactive distillation, {{it was possible to}} remove ethanol to shift the equilibrium towards diacetin and triacetin. Therefore, the total selectivity to diacetin and triacetin was increased from 55 % to 97 % through azeotropic distillation...|$|E
40|$|Transesterification of {{glycerol}} with {{methyl acetate}} {{was carried out}} over resins, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and chitosan (CH) with sulfonic acid groups at 70 º C. The products of glycerol transesterification are <b>monoacetin,</b> diacetin and triacetin. It was observed that the catalytic activity increases {{with the amount of}} sulfonic acid groups on materials. The CH material showed the highest catalytic activity of all catalysts. In order to study the catalytic stability of CH-SO 3 H, three consecutive batch runs with the same catalyst were carried out.

40|$|Sulphonated {{hydrothermal}} carbon (SHTC), {{obtained from}} d-glucose by mild hydrothermal carbonisation and subsequent sulphonation with sulphuric acid, {{is able to}} catalyse the esterification of glycerol with different carboxylic acids, namely, acetic, butyric and caprylic acids. Product selectivity can be tuned by simply controlling the reaction conditions. On the one hand, SHTC provides {{one of the best}} selectivity towards <b>monoacetins</b> described up to now without the need for an excess of glycerol. On the other hand, excellent selectivity towards triacylglycerides (TAG) can be obtained, beyond those described with other solid catalysts, including well-known sulphonic resins. Recovery of the catalyst showed partial deactivation of the solid. The formation of sulphonate esters on the surface, confirmed by solid state NMR, was the cause of this behaviour. Acid treatment of the used catalyst, with subsequent hydrolysis of the surface sulphonate esters, allows SHTC to recover its activity. The higher selectivity towards mono- and triesters and its renewable origin makes SHTC an attractive catalyst in biorefinery processes.

30|$|Importantly, {{the scope}} of the {{reaction}} was also extended to the valorization of crude glycerol (GlyBio) from a biodiesel company [27]. The biocatalyst selectively converted crude glycerol into <b>monoacetin</b> with moderate conversion at low flow rate (0.5  mL.min- 1, 4.8  min of residence time) in the presence of ethyl acetate at 60 °C. Promisingly, the use of vinyl acetate promoted triacetin production (84 %) at low flow rate (0.5  mL.min- 1, 4.8  min of residence time), with only small quantities of diacetins observed under the investigated conditions. Diacetin production increased to 70 % and 60 % (1.5  mL.min- 1 and 3.0  mL.min- 1, respectively) at higher residence times (14.4 and 28.8  min for 1.5  mL.min- 1 and 3.0  mL.min- 1, respectively).|$|E
40|$|The {{acetylation}} of glycerol {{was carried}} out over dodecatungstophosphoric acid (PW) supported on activated carbon, being the <b>monoacetin,</b> diacetin and triacetin the reaction products. A series of catalysts, with different heteropolyacid loading (from 3. 5 to 6. 5 wt. %), were prepared. It was observed that the catalytic activity increases {{with the amount of}} PW immobilized on the activated carbon, being the PW 2 _AC (with 4. 9 wt. %) the most active sample. However, at high loading of heteropolyacid on the activated carbon, a decrease on the catalytic activity was observed, which can be probably explained due to some hindrance in the activated carbon porous system. All catalysts exhibited good values of selectivity to the diacetin. Catalytic stability of the PW 2 _AC was also studied by performing consecutives batch runs with the same catalyst sample.

40|$|The {{esterification}} of glycerol with {{acetic acid}} {{was carried out}} over dodecamolybdophosphoric acid (PMo) encaged in the USY zeolite. The products of glycerol acetylation were <b>monoacetin,</b> diacetin and triacetin. A series of PMo encaged in the NaUSY zeolite with different PMo loading from 0. 6 to 5. 4 wt. % were prepared.

40|$|The {{esterification}} of glycerol with {{acetic acid}} {{was carried out}} over dodecatungstophosphoric acid (PW) immobilized into a silica matrix. The products of glycerol acetylation were <b>monoacetin,</b> diacetin and triacetin. The immobilization of PW into silica {{was carried out by}} two different techniques: sol–gel and impregnation methods. The catalysts prepared by sol–gel method will be denoted as PW-in-S while the catalysts prepared by impregnation will be denoted as PW-on-S. The catalysts were characterized by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K, FTIR, XDR and ICP-AES. A series of PW immobilized into silica with different PW loading were prepared. It was observed that the catalytic activity increases with the amount of PW immobilized into silica, either by the sol–gel method or by the impregnation method. High values of selectivity to diacetin were obtained with all catalyst. The effect of various parameters, such as, reaction temperature, catalyst loading, molar ratio of glycerol to acetic acid and reusability of PW-in-S 2 were studied to optimize the reaction conditions.

30|$|Karinen and Krause {{reported}} the etherification of glycerol with isobutene over acid exchange resin catalyst [6, 7]. Etherification of glycerol with tert-butanol over acid exchange resin or zeolite catalysts are also reported [8, 9]. Reddy et al. [10], and coworkers reported sulphated ceria-zirconia and ceria alumina type solid acid catalyst for glycerol acetylation to replace mineral acid based catalyst. Bagheri and Muhd [20], reviewed the various value added product formation from glycerol by bimetallic catalysts. Hence, utilization of glycerol by acetylating agent via catalytic method is another alternative methodology. The present study deals with bimetallic particle doped silica-alumina type solid acid catalyst preparation and tested for glycerol acetylation. The glycerol acetylaiton {{products such as}} mono, di and triacetyl esters have great industrial applications. The triacetylated derivative is known as triacetin and has application going from cosmetics to fuel additive [11, 12]. The mono and diacetylated esters (<b>monoacetin</b> and diacetin) are used in cryogenics and as raw material for production of biodegradable polyesters [13]. The aim of the present work deal with acetylation of glycerol over silver and copper incorporated rice husk silica-alumina solid acid catalyst to produce di and triacetylated glycerols with good selectivity under mild reaction conditions. The influence of various reaction parameters has also been studied.|$|E
40|$|AbstractGlycerol uptake and {{glycerol}} kinase activity {{were studied}} in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes {{in the presence}} of either 1 nM insulin, 1 nM glucagon, or 100 nM dexamethasone, alone or in combination in the culture medium. Glycerol uptake exhibited saturation kinetic with Km values (μM) and Vmax (nmol/min×mg protein) ranging from 250 – 402, and 7. 9 – 10. 1, respectively. The corresponding Km and Vmax values for glycerol kinase activity were 36 – 46 and 8. 7 – 12, 7. Using the metabolic uncoupler 2, 4 -dinitrophenol, glycerol uptake and the cellular content of glycerol phosphorylated metabolites were reduced 33 % and 43 %, respectively, whereas no decrease in the cellular content of glycerol was seen. The glycerol analogues <b>monoacetin,</b> monobutyrin and dihydroxypropyl dichloroacetate were able in a concentration-dependent manner to inhibit glycerol uptake into hepatocytes with the two latter having IC 50 values of approximately 1 mM. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the three glycerol analogues were substrates for glycerol kinase, which indicates a competitive mode of inhibition. The kinetic parameters for these substrates were calculated by using glycerol kinase from Candida Mycoderma. Monobutyrin was found to be 4 times lees efficient as substrate compared to the other substrates. Overall, these results indicate that independently of the culture conditions, glycerol uptake is the rate-limiting step in glycerol metabolism, and that the investigated glycerol analogues are metabolized via the same route as glycerol...|$|E
40|$|Treatment {{experiments}} and blood sugar determinations {{were carried out}} on organofluoride-intoxicated animals {{and the results were}} as follows. 1. FAM (monofluoroacetamide) -intoxicated rats were treated with various acetyl radical transferring compounds of which acetamide was found to be most effective and resulted in 100 % recovery of the animals treated. Treatment with ethanol <b>monoacetin,</b> and glucose led to the prolongation of survival times of the intoxicated rats. Some increases of the survival times and anticonvulsive effects were obtained also by the use of phenobarbital and procainamide. 2. Administration of acetamide and procainamide to FAM-intoxicated rabbits resulted in approximately twice as longer survival times as those of the controls. 3. FAM administered rats showed a general tendency to low blood sugar levels, and the more the dosage of FAM was given, the greater the degree of hypoglycemia was observed. The maximum decrease was noted in the midst of or before and after convulsions of the administered rats. Methylparathion and Endrin administered rats, on the contrary, indicated increased levels of blood sugars. These observations suggest that determination of blood sugar levels can be a clue to differentiating organofluoride-intoxication from organic phosphate and chloride (especially Endrin) -intoxications which occur frequently in Japan. And this point may contribute {{to the understanding of the}} etiology of organofluoride-intoxication. 4. A close relationship between unconsciousness and a decrease in blood sugar levels was obtained in a MNFA (N-methyl-N-(1 -naphthyl) monofluoroacetate) -intoxicated human case. Administration of large doses of glucose was found to be very effective for the recovery of unconsciousness...|$|E
40|$|Glycerol is a {{low value}} {{molecule}} obtained as a sub-product from the manufacture of first generation biodiesel. The surplus of glycerol can be revaluated by its acetylation, forming high value molecules (<b>monoacetin,</b> diacetin and triacetin) {{which can be used}} in the polymer industry and as a biodiesel among other possibilities. This work provides a comparative study of the catalytic performances of a large scope of acid solids in the esterification of acetic acid with an excess of glycerol. Aluminium containing formulations (niobium oxide supported on commercial silica-alumina, aluminium phosphate) presented an inhibitory effect probably due to the amphoteric character of aluminium-bonded hydroxyl groups and the presence of basic sites where the limiting reagent (acetic acid) could be strongly adsorbed being unavailable for the reaction. Tungstated zirconia samples presented an inert behaviour, due to the deactivation of active sites by strong adsorption of water or glycerol. Tungstophosphoric acid immobilised by sol-gel technique in zirconia and silica, presented a high resistance to leaching. The strong interaction between the heteropolyacid and the matrixes led, however, to the lowering of the heteropolyacid acid strength, resulting in an absence of catalytic activity. Sulphated zirconia synthesised by sol-gel showed good catalytic activity. The lower the density of acid sites, the higher the catalytic activity. Nevertheless, these solids were undesirably deactivated due to sulphur leaching, thus also bringing an undesired contamination of the final products. Commercial ion exchange resins with strong Brønsted acid sites also exhibited very high catalytic performances. The lower the crosslinkage, the higher the resin swelling in the reaction medium, and thus the higher the catalytic activity. These solids were recyclable and active even in presence of water.
