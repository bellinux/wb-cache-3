40|$|This study {{investigated}} the capacity for <b>mantle</b> regeneration in the pearl oyster Pinctada maxima. Oysters were anaesthetised with 2. 5  mL L- 1 prophylene phenoxetol prior {{to a piece of}} tissue (approximately 10  ×  30  mm 2) being excised from the ventral region of the <b>mantle.</b> In the first experiment, 56 oysters with mean (±SD) dorso-ventral measurement (DVM) of 125. 5  ±  8. 9  mm had tissue excised from either the right <b>mantle</b> lobe, left <b>mantle</b> lobe or both <b>mantle</b> lobes. Following a further three month period in suspended culture, oyster survival was recorded and two oysters were selected arbitrarily from each group to be sacrificed for histological examination of healed <b>mantle.</b> In the second experiment 36 oysters with mean (±SD) DVM of 151. 6  ±  13. 4  mm were used for excision of the distal part of the ventral region of the left <b>mantle</b> lobe. Two oysters were sampled at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 120  h (5 days) after <b>mantle</b> excision, and then at 12, 24, 45, 72 and 90  d after <b>mantle</b> excision for histological and histochemical analysis of <b>mantle</b> regeneration. There was almost 100 percent survival in both experiments. Healing and regeneration of <b>mantle</b> tissue in oysters subject to excision from the left, right or both <b>mantle</b> lobes was evident, with regenerated <b>mantle</b> appearing similar to non-regenerated <b>mantle.</b> All external and internal components of non-regenerated <b>mantle</b> were present in regenerated <b>mantle</b> tissue. Epithelization signifying wound healing occurred within 36 - 72  h and was characterised by a reduced wound area, haemocyte infiltration and accumulation, and cell dedifferentiation. Within 48  h of <b>mantle</b> excision, the latero-ventral edges of the wound flexed dorsally and attached to the dorsal edge of the wound reducing the wound area. Between five and twelve days after excision, the distal part of the <b>mantle</b> had divided into three small lobes which developed into the outer, middle and inner <b>mantle</b> folds two weeks later. Ninety days after excision the <b>mantle</b> had completely regenerated with histological observations indicating no difference in epithelial structure or in other internal <b>mantle</b> accessories when compared to non-regenerated <b>mantle.</b> Shell material began to be secreted onto the shell by regenerating <b>mantle</b> twelve days after excision.

5000|$|<b>Mantle</b> length (ML) is the {{standard}} size measure for coleoid cephalopods (shell diameter being more common for nautiluses) and is almost universally reported in the scientific literature. The <b>mantle</b> is the cephalopod's [...] "body"; it lies posterior to the head and encloses the visceral mass and <b>mantle</b> cavity, the latter being used for locomotion by jet propulsion. Unless otherwise indicated, <b>mantle</b> length is measured dorsally over the midline of the <b>mantle.</b> In Decapodiformes (ten-limbed cephalopods), <b>mantle</b> length is measured from the anterior edge of the <b>mantle</b> (near the head), to the posterior end of the <b>mantle</b> or {{the apex of the}} united fins, whichever is longer. In Octopodiformes (eight-limbed cephalopods), the anterior edge of the <b>mantle</b> is not clearly delimited dorsally due to advanced head-mantle fusion, and <b>mantle</b> length is therefore taken from the midpoint between the eyes to the posterior end of the <b>mantle.</b> When ventral <b>mantle</b> length is meant instead of dorsal this is always specified as such and abbreviated VML (Roper & Voss, 1983:58).|$|R

40|$|The {{temperature}} in the upper <b>mantle</b> is estimated {{on the basis of}} the mineralogical behaviour of <b>mantle</b> materials. Three assumptions are made in the estimation: i. e. (1) Kanamori's Vp-model is the representative of normal upper <b>mantle</b> in a tectonically active region, (2) the upper <b>mantle</b> is composed of olivine-rich peridotite and Fe/Mg ratio of <b>mantle</b> olivine is 1 / 9, and (3) the cause of the low velocity zone is partial melting. The upper <b>mantle</b> can be divided into two classes in a tectonically active region: (1) hot upper <b>mantle,</b> and (2) normal upper <b>mantle.</b> Two temperature distributions of a different kind are obtained for these <b>mantles.</b> Accordingly, two kinds of electrical conductivity distributions in the upper <b>mantle</b> are determined corresponding to the temperature distributions. The electrical conductivity in the hot upper <b>mantle</b> is two orders of magnitude, at least, higher than that in the normal upper <b>mantle</b> at depths shallower than several tens of kilometers. The high conductivity in the hot upper <b>mantle</b> might possibly correspond to "conductivity anomaly" in the upper <b>mantle.</b> The electrical conductivity thus estimated is lower than 10 - 13 emu even in the anomalous regions, as far as Fe/Mg ratio in <b>mantle</b> olivine [(Mg, Fe) 2 SiO 4] is assumed to be 1 / 9. To explain the electrical conductivity higher than 10 - 12 emu as has been estimated in anomalous regions in some cases, the Fe/Mg ratio in <b>mantle</b> olivine should be assumed to be higher than 1 / 9 (e. g., 1. 5 / 8. 5) in the uppermost part of the hot upper <b>mantle,</b> not in the whole upper <b>mantle.</b> The point that a Fe-rich <b>mantle</b> should be assumed in hot regions seems important. |最近の,高温高圧実験から得られた,岩石や鉱物の,物理的性質や,鉱物学的性質に関するデータと,地震学的研究によつて得られた,上部マントルに関する諸事実とを,組合せて,上部マントルの温度を推定した. さらに,推定された温度分布と,最近得られた造岩鉱物,特に,オリビンの,電気伝導度のデータとを用いて,上部マントルの電気伝導度の分布を推定し,さらに,上部マントルの,電気伝導度異常について,その成因を考えた...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGreenstone basalts and komatiites {{provide a}} means to track both <b>mantle</b> {{composition}} and magma generation temperature with time. Four types of <b>mantle</b> are characterized from incompatible element distributions in basalts and komatiites: depleted, hydrated, enriched and <b>mantle</b> from which komatiites are derived. Our most important observation is the recognition {{for the first time}} of what we refer to as a Great Thermal Divergence within the <b>mantle</b> beginning {{near the end of the}} Archean, which we ascribe to thermal and convective evolution. Prior to 2. 5  Ga, depleted and enriched <b>mantle</b> have indistinguishable thermal histories, whereas at 2. 5 – 2. 0  Ga a divergence in <b>mantle</b> magma generation temperature begins between these two types of <b>mantle.</b> Major and incompatible element distributions and calculated magma generation temperatures suggest that Archean enriched <b>mantle</b> did not come from <b>mantle</b> plumes, but was part of an undifferentiated or well-mixed <b>mantle</b> similar in composition to calculated primitive <b>mantle.</b> During this time, however, high-temperature <b>mantle</b> plumes from dominantly depleted sources gave rise to komatiites and associated basalts.

50|$|Earth's <b>mantle</b> {{extends to}} a depth of 2,890 km, making it the {{thickest}} layer of Earth. The <b>mantle</b> is divided into upper and lower <b>mantle.</b> The upper and lower <b>mantle</b> are separated by the transition zone. The lowest part of the <b>mantle</b> next to the core-mantle boundary is known as the D″ (pronounced dee-double-prime) layer. The pressure {{at the bottom of the}} <b>mantle</b> is ≈140 GPa (1.4 Matm). The <b>mantle</b> is composed of silicate rocks that are rich in iron and magnesium relative to the overlying crust. Although solid, the high temperatures within the <b>mantle</b> cause the silicate material to be sufficiently ductile that it can flow on very long timescales. Convection of the <b>mantle</b> is expressed at the surface through the motions of tectonic plates. As there is intense and increasing pressure as one travels deeper into the <b>mantle,</b> the lower part of the <b>mantle</b> flows less easily than does the upper <b>mantle</b> (chemical changes within the <b>mantle</b> may also be important). The viscosity of the <b>mantle</b> ranges between 1021 and 1024 Pa·s, depending on depth. In comparison, the viscosity of water is approximately 10−3 Pa·s and that of pitch is 107 Pa·s. The source of heat that drives plate tectonics is the primordial heat left over from the planet’s formation as well as the radioactive decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium in Earth’s crust and <b>mantle.</b>|$|R

50|$|Convection within Earth's <b>mantle</b> is {{the driving}} force for plate tectonics. <b>Mantle</b> {{convection}} {{is the result of a}} thermal gradient: the lower <b>mantle</b> is hotter than the upper <b>mantle,</b> and is therefore less dense.

5|$|The {{instruments}} of the Passion were sometimes split between a shield and crest {{in the form}} of an achievement of arms (Neubecker, 222).

The heraldry continues with the 15th century jousting helmet, which is covered by the seamless robe as a form of <b>mantling,</b> and the Cross, scepter (of mockery) and flagellum (whip) as crest. The banner's long red schwenkel is a mark of eminence in German heraldry, but it was omitted when this image was copied into Randle Holme's Book (c. 1464–1480). The image on the opposing page (shown above) includes a shield quartered with the five Wounds of Christ, three jars of ointment, two rods, and the head of Judas Iscariot with a bag of money (Dennys, 97–98).|$|E
5|$|Each {{member of}} the Order, {{including}} the Sovereign, is allotted a stall in the Chapel, above which his or her heraldic devices are displayed. Perched on the pinnacle of a knight's stall is his helm, decorated with <b>mantling</b> and topped by his crest. If he is a peer, the coronet appropriate to his rank is placed beneath the helm. Under the laws of heraldry, women, other than monarchs, do not normally bear helms nor crests; instead, the coronet alone is used (if she is a peeress or princess). Lady Marion Fraser had a helm and crest included when she was granted arms; these are displayed above her stall {{in the same manner}} as for knights. Unlike other British Orders, the armorial banners of Knights and Ladies of the Thistle are not hung in the chapel, but instead in an adjacent part of St Giles High Kirk.

These enamelled plates are affixed to the back of the stall and display its occupant's name, arms, and date of admission into the Order.|$|E
5|$|In English, {{achievements}} of arms are usually described (blazoned) in a specialized jargon that uses derivatives of French terms.

Purpur (purple) is used in the lining of crowns and in the royal canopy of the greater national coat of arms. Traditionally, purple was rarely used as a tincture on the shield, though it does appear on the shields of some (especially modern) burgher arms.

5|$|Swedish {{heraldry}} has {{a number}} of characteristics that distinguish the Swedish style from heraldry in other European countries. Common features of Swedish heraldry {{are similar to those of}} other Nordic countries and Germany, placing it in the German-Nordic heraldic tradition, distinguished from Gallo-British heraldry and other heraldic traditions by several key elements of heraldic style. One of these is the use of multiple helmets and crests, which cannot be displayed separately from the main shield. These helmets and crests are considered to be as important as the shield, each denoting a fief over which the bearer holds a right. In Scandinavia (as distinct from the German custom), when an even number of helmets is displayed, they are usually turned, with their crests, to face outward; when an odd number, the center helmet is turned affronté and the rest turned outward (whereas in Germany the helmets are turned inward to face the center of the escutcheon). Additionally, the crests are often repetitive of charges used on the main shield, and marks of cadency typically occur in the crest, rather than on the shield as in Gallo-British heraldry. Also, the use of heraldic furs on the shield, while common in Gallo-British heraldry, is rare in German-Nordic heraldry. Furs in Scandinavia are generally limited to ermine and vair, which sometimes appear in <b>mantling,</b> supporters, or the trimmings of crowns, but rarely on the shield.|$|E
