5|$|The <b>market</b> <b>place</b> at {{the centre}} of Poulton is the width of two streets and is now closed to motor traffic. Lying south of St Chad's Church and {{surrounded}} by shops, the square contains the town's war memorial {{as well as a}} market cross, stocks, whipping post and fish slabs, from which fish were sold on market days. Although many of the buildings surrounding the <b>market</b> <b>place</b> were rebuilt following a fire in the 18thcentury, a few of the earlier buildings remain. To the south of the <b>market</b> <b>place</b> are town houses that were built for local merchants and professionals.|$|E
5|$|Within Shepton Mallet {{there are}} several {{distinct}} areas which originated as separate communities around the central point {{of the church and}} <b>Market</b> <b>Place.</b> The town centre is small, basically consisting of two streets: High Street, which runs south from the <b>Market</b> <b>Place</b> towards the Townsend Retail Park, and the pedestrianised Town Street which runs north from the <b>Market</b> <b>Place</b> to Waterloo Bridge. To the east, separated from the <b>Market</b> <b>Place</b> by the Academy complex, is the parish church of St Peter and St Paul. Lower Lane, which runs under Waterloo Bridge along the bottom of the river valley {{to the north of the}} town centre, is one of the few parts of the town where the River Sheppey runs above ground. At the eastern end is Leg Square, which is surrounded by three large houses originally built by owners of some of the town's mills. Very close by is Cornhill, on which the former prison stands.|$|E

5|$|The {{northern}} {{section of}} the main <b>market</b> <b>place,</b> immediately south of the tollhouse, housed fishmongers, butchers, ironmongers and woolsellers. This {{section of the}} market also housed the murage loft after 1294, where tolls to fund the building of Norwich's city walls were collected. The southern section of the main <b>market</b> <b>place,</b> north of St Peter Mancroft, housed a bread market {{and a number of}} stalls associated with Norwich's significant cloth and leather industries. A broad space between the main marketplace and the Nethererowe was kept clear for the use of country smallholders, who would set up temporary booths and tents to sell their wares.|$|E

5|$|As part {{of civic}} {{redevelopment}} {{of the market}} area and surrounding buildings in 1938, the cenotaph was moved to a site on <b>Market</b> <b>Place,</b> between the new City Hall and the castle. There it formed the centrepiece of a dedicated memorial garden by C.H. James and S.R. Pierce. The garden was opened by King George VI on 29 October 1938. The whole monument now stands on a terrace which runs parallel to the city hall, sloping towards <b>Market</b> <b>Place</b> with steps accommodating the gradient. A row of eight ornamental lamp-posts stands along {{either side of the}} memorial itself, one of which is a later replacement. Two flagpoles stand at the corners, at the bases of which are low relief brass carvings of allegorical figures of Peace and Plenty.|$|E
5|$|For centuries {{there has}} been a general market held each Friday in the <b>Market</b> <b>Place.</b> The market has been in decline for some years and in 2010 {{attempts}} were made to revitalise it. However, after initial interest, the number of stallholders slowly decreased. In recent months a number of suitcase traders have been supporting the market on a regular basis and this has attracted local interest.|$|E
