40|$|Dr. Margaret Ellen Heffernan OAMAustralia {{has one of}} {{the lowest}} incidences of {{cervical}} cancer globally, but its disproportionate rate among Aboriginal women, the underscreening cervical practices of some cultural groups, and the high incidence of other HPV-related morbidities in the general population makes a compelling need for HPV vaccination. High coverage of prophylactic HPV vaccines in sexually naïve adolescents will substantially reduce their risk of oncogenic HPV infection, and subsequent related disease; but as the hepatitis B vaccine experience demonstrated vaccinating this cohort presents challenges for public health providers. The delivery model of HPV immunisation into Australia, which commenced as an organised national program in 2007, mirrored that of other adolescent vaccination programs and its uptake has <b>met</b> <b>forecast</b> expectations. Prior to the introduction of the HPV vaccines the lay public globally had little awareness of genital HPV infection and its sexual characteristics and concerns were held that once this factor was known it may impact on parental consent. Very little behavioural research had been undertaken to identify determinants of acceptance for HPV vaccination in pre-adolescents among Australian parents with diverse cultural norms for a new vaccine that has potentially controversial and some unique characteristics. This thesis argued that in order for there to be widespread uptake of the HPV vaccine among targeted female adolescents in a mixed-culture nation culturally appropriate implementation strategies are needed. The research examines the attitudes of General Practitioners (GPs) and parents from three distinct cultural groups towards HPV vaccination among preadolescent children, and in particular the influence of cultural norms on parental attitudes and intentions. Applying qualitative methods through a systematic framework approach, this thesis aimed to (i) explore the determinants that influence parental and health provider attitudes; (ii) examine those elements through a multiple perspectives lens; and (iii) identify key factors and approaches for the successful uptake to the delivery of HPV vaccines into diverse cultural populations. To achieve these aims, a mixed-method purposive sampling strategy was applied with GPs practicing in Victoria, and Aboriginal, Anglo and Chinese-Australian parents residing in Victoria or Central Australia. The method and semi-structured interview guide explored knowledge and attitudes toward cervical cancer prevention from biomedical, structural, psychosocial and cultural perspectives. A key finding is that socio-cultural and environmental factors do provide challenges for parents and health providers in accepting HPV vaccines in pre-adolescents. Participants demonstrated a positive attitude toward adolescent vaccination, but their attitudes reflected their normative values toward health prevention and sexuality. Their experiences were shown to influence their education resource and infrastructure needs indicating that implementation strategies for HPV vaccines cannot be generalised to cross-cultural populations. Findings from this study can begin to provide a socio-ecological basis for the development of culturally sensitive approaches to encourage HPV vaccination in the Australian adolescent cohort. The empirical findings also have significant implications for guiding its diverse population to a new cervical cancer prevention paradigm. Open Acces...|$|E

However, for a complex nonlinear dynamical system such as the ocean or atmosphere, this is not as obvious. Knowing when or where the system is most sensitive, to observational uncertainty or otherwise, is key to understanding the physical processes, improving and providing reliable forecasts. We describe the application of adjoint modeling to determine the sensitivity of sea level at a UK coastal location, Sheerness, to perturbations in wind stress preceding an extreme North Sea storm surge event on 9 November 2007. Sea level at Sheerness {{is one of the most}} important factors used to decide whether to close the Thames Flood Barrier, which protects London. Adjoint modeling has been used by meteorologists since the 1990 s, but is a relatively new technique for ocean modeling.

Using estimates of wind stress error from <b>Met</b> Office <b>forecasts,</b> we find that for this event total sea level at Sheerness is most sensitive in the 3 h preceding the time of its unperturbed maximum level and over a radius of approximately 300 km.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an assessment of}} synoptic measurements of sea surface salinity (SSS) from the European Space Agency Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite. Due to the complex nature of the response of L-band signals to SSS, SMOS provides three values of SSS at each grid point from three different forward models. To meet oceanographic requirements for SSS retrieval accuracy, SMOS Level 2 SSS products are averaged over time and space. This paper reports on validation studies in the Atlantic based on monthly Level 3 products on a $ 1 ^{circ}times 1 ^{circ}$ grid for September 2010. Outside coastal regions, large-scale SSS patterns from SMOS are in general agreement with climatology, Argo, and ocean model output. During September 2010, SSS from descending passes provides reasonable quantitative estimates, while SSS from ascending passes overestimates SSS by over 1 practical salinity unit (psu). The daily mean difference in SSS between ascending and descending passes varies during August–December 2010, reaching a maximum in September. Differences in SMOS SSS from the three models are {{an order of magnitude}} smaller than differences between ascending and descending passes.

40|$|Satellite {{observations}} of water vapour and radiative fluxes {{are used in}} combination with reanalyses data to evaluate the Met Office weather and climate prediction models. Using reanalysis vertical motion data, it is established {{that much of the}} climate model error in radiative fluxes relates to errors in dynamical fields. Radiative feedback processes are to a large extent independent of these positional errors in the large-scale circulation. It is therefore of great value to analyse the relationships between water vapour, clouds and radiation in terms of dynamic regime or by averaging over large-scale circulation systems. Using the latter approach, it is found that the monthly and interannual relationships between water vapour and clear-sky radiation are consistent between models and satellite data. However, the variation in cloud radiative effect appears much larger in the observations than the model. To further understanding of radiative feedback processes involving water vapour and cloud, in is necessary to examine sub-monthly time-scales.

Marked variations in the large scale structure of the cloud field were observed during the experiment on both day to day and on diurnal timescales. In the remote maritime region the model is shown to have a good representation of synoptically induced variability in both cloud cover and marine boundary layer depth. Satellite observations show a strong diurnal cycle in cloud fraction and liquid water path in the stratocumulus with enhanced clearances of the cloud deck along the Chilean and Peruvian coasts on certain days. The model accurately simulates the phase of the diurnal cycle but is unable to capture the coastal clearing of cloud. Observations along the 20 &deg; S latitude line show a gradual increase in the depth of the boundary layer away from the coast. This trend is well captured by the model (typical low bias of 200 m) although significant errors exist at the coast where the model marine boundary layer is too shallow and moist. Drizzle in the model responds to changes in liquid water path {{in a manner that is}} consistent with previous ship-borne observations in the region although the intensity of this drizzle is likely to be too high, particularly in the more polluted coastal region where higher cloud droplet number concentrations are typical.

40|$|Snowfall occurs {{every winter}} over the {{mountains}} of South Africa but is rare over the highly populated metropolises over the interior of South Africa. When snowfall does occur over highly populated areas, it causes widespread disruption to infrastructure and even loss of life. Because of the rarity of snow over the interior of South Africa, inexperienced weather forecasters often miss these events. We propose a five-step snow forecasting decision tree in which all five criteria must be <b>met</b> to <b>forecast</b> snowfall. The decision tree comprises physical attributes that are necessary for snowfall to occur. The first step recognises the synoptic circulation patterns associated with snow and the second step detects whether precipitation is likely in an area. The remaining steps all deal with identifying {{the presence of a}} snowflake in a cloud and determining that the snowflake will not melt {{on the way to the}} ground. The decision tree is especially useful to forecast the very rare snow events that develop from relatively dry and warmer surface conditions. We propose operational implementation of the decision tree in the weather forecasting offices of South Africa, as it is foreseen that this approach could significantly contribute to accurately forecasting snow over the interior of South Africa. SIGNIFICANCE : • A method for forecasting disruptive snowfall is provided. It is envisaged that this method will contribute to the improved forecasting of these severe weather events over South Africa. • Weather systems responsible for snowfall are documented and the cloud microphysical aspects important for the growth and melting of a snowflake are discussed. • Forecasting methods are proposed for the very rare events when snow occurs over the interior of South Africa when the air is relatively dry and somewhat warmer.

After remapping, the noise performance (NEΔT) of the tropospheric temperature sounding channels is evaluated to be approximately 0. 1 [*]K, comparing favourably with AMSU-A.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to further our {{understanding}} of whether skilful seasonal forecasts of the large-scale atmospheric circulation can be downscaled to provide skilful seasonal forecasts of regional precipitation. A simple multiple linear regression model is developed to describe winter precipitation variability in nine UK regions.

The first index is a pressure dipole, similar to the North Atlantic Oscillation but shifted to the east; the second index is the MSLP anomaly centred over the UK. The multiple linear regression model describes up to 76 % of the observed precipitation variability in each region, and gives higher correlations with precipitation than using either of the two indices alone.

40|$|Copyright @ 2007 AMSThe Convective Storm Initiation Project (CSIP) is an {{international}} project to understand precisely where, when, and how convective clouds form and develop into showers in the mainly maritime environment of southern England. A major aim of CSIP is to compare {{the results of the}} very high resolution <b>Met</b> Office weather <b>forecasting</b> model with detailed observations of the early stages of convective clouds and to use the newly gained understanding to improve the predictions of the model. A large array of ground-based instruments plus two instrumented aircraft, from the U. K. National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS) and the German Institute for Meteorology and Climate Research (IMK), Karlsruhe, were deployed in southern England, over an area centered on the meteorological radars at Chilbolton, during the summers of 2004 and 2005. In addition to a variety of ground-based remote-sensing instruments, numerous rawin-sondes were released at one- to two-hourly intervals from six closely spaced sites. The Met Office weather radar network and Meteosat satellite imagery were used to provide context for the observations made by the instruments deployed during CSIP. This article presents an overview of the CSIP field campaign and examples from CSIP of the types of convective initiation phenomena that are typical in the United Kingdom.
