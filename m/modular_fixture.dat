40|$|Manufacturing and {{assembly}} processes often require objects {{to be held}} {{in such a way that}} they can resist all external wrenches. The problem of "fixture planning" is to compute, for a given object and a set of fixturing elements, the set of placements of the fixturing elements that constrain all finite and infinitesimal motions of the object (due to applied wrenches). As fixturing problems occur frequently in manufacturing {{and assembly}}, it becomes costly to build a dedicated fixturing solution for each different problem. <b>Modular</b> <b>fixturing</b> toolkits offer the advantage of reusability of the fixturing elements and have therefore gained considerable popularity. A <b>modular</b> <b>fixturing</b> toolkit consists of a fixturing table with a rectangular grid of holes, and a set of fixturing elements whose positions are restricted to the holes in the table.

40|$|Abstract: In the {{development}} of a <b>modular</b> <b>fixture</b> design system, it is essential to have a <b>modular</b> <b>fixture</b> element database that can be integrated with a CAD system, in addition to the other considerations such as fixture configuration, interference checking, etc., which are also important to fixture designers. This paper describes a new method to create the fixture element database and model the fixturing towers (i. e. subassem-blies). By using this method, the database can be effectively created and is easy for use in fixture assembly. The <b>modular</b> <b>fixture</b> tower database is used to represent the subassembly of fixtures. This will simplify the fixture design and assembly process. A built-in interference checking methodology is embedded in the plan-ning stage that will ensure a collision-free fixture design.

40|$|A fixture is {{a device}} that locates and holds parts during {{machining}} or assembly. A <b>modular</b> <b>fixture</b> employs reusable components on a regular lattice. Given a part, machinists combine intuition with trial-and-error to design an appropriate fixture.

Complete algorithms for modular fixturing, such as [Brost and Goldberg 1994], insure that no fixture design is overlooked. But the question remains: are there parts for which no <b>modular</b> <b>fixture</b> exists? For the class of modular fixtures using 3 locators and a clamp, we show that there exists a class of polygonal parts that cannot be fixtured.

40|$|<b>Modular</b> <b>fixturing</b> is an {{important}} concept in advanced manufacturing and tool design courses in the Industrial Technology (IT) curriculum. The wide variety of tooling and fixtures are difficult to cover within a single semester (or quarter) through traditional methods, especially if consideration of related topics on cutting tools or geometric dimensioning and tolerancing are included.

The program incorporates systematic design procedure in conjunction with a large library of rules governing the movement and combination of the modular elements. A key feature of the system is the development of a suitable spatial representation technique, to describe those regions of space which are occupied by the workpiece itself, by the fixture and by the tools used to produce it.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{application}} of case based reasoning (CBR) to welding fixtures in a computer aided design (CAD) environment. <b>Modular</b> <b>fixtures</b> have become more popular in previous years due {{to the creation of}} flexible manufacturing systems. <b>Modular</b> <b>fixtures,</b> since they are composed of many standardized parts, require much iteration to produce a full fixture design. This process is made more complicated when it is applied to more complex parts such as welding assemblies. In an effort to simplify fixture design for such complicated parts, researchers have been working on integrating fixture design into CAD packages. These efforts, generally known as computer aided fixture design (CAFD), do not focus on the transition of experience from more experienced designers but only provide a structure and a virtual environment to create fixtures. The research presented in this thesis will apply to this area. Case based reasoning (CBR) is a method of using previous cases to help aid the development of solutions to new problems. Applied to CAFD, this method is reduced to the application of a database and a retrieval and adaptation system. Current research on CAFD and CBR is limited to only proposing systems for machining fixtures.

Changeability in Manufacturing Systems has been implemented in various industries {{over the last}} forty years to meet the challenge of change in product demand and design. Changeability is an umbrella paradigm and consists of different manufacturing system characteristics, such as changeover-ability, reconfigurability, flexibility, transformability and agility. On the system level, flexibility is enabled particularly by implementing modular equipment designs such as modular fixtures that can hold a variety of product geometries. On the operational level, optimizing the changeability plan of those modular fixtures improves the performance of the manufacturing system. This thesis considers a hole-pattern <b>modular</b> <b>fixture</b> to increase the changeability of an automated assembly system. In this assembly setting, a robot that is located on top of a conveyor belt loop places different parts on the <b>modular</b> <b>fixture</b> and secure them by inserting four pegs around each part. The more peg replacements are occurred, the longer fixture setup time is required. Hence, the researchers of this study have developed five different mathematical models to effectively determine the best parts and pegs locations on the fixture to minimize the number of pegs replacements considering different conditions and constraints. At this point, researchers presented a new fixture design that improves the fixture modularity to hold more products with different geometries. By making a few modifications, the five previous models have been extended to be used for this new fixture design. Subsequently, researchers proposed three case studies with different parameters sizes to investigate the models’ efficiency. The results show that the different models are able to significantly reduce fixture setup time...|$|E

In this regard, modular fixtures (MFs) play an important role in practically improving productivity in flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs) due to this technology using highly productive computer numerical control (CNC) machines. MFs consist of devices called jigs and fixtures for accurately holding the workpiece during different machining operations. The design process is complex, and traditional methods of MF design were not sufficiently productive. Computer-aided design (CAD) software has rapidly improved as a result of the development of computer technology, and has provided huge opportunities for <b>modular</b> <b>fixture</b> designers to use its 3 D modelling capabilities to develop more automated systems. Computer-aided fixture design (CAFD) systems have become automated by the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. This study will investigate the further improvement of automated CAFD systems by using AI tools. In this research, an integrated CAFD is developed by considering four main requirements: · a 3 D model of the workpiece, · an expert system, · assembly automation of MFs, · an efficient feature library. The 3 D model is an important factor that can provide the appropriate specification of the workpiece; SolidWorks is used the CAD environment for undertaking the 3 D modelling in this study. The expert system is applied as a tool to make right decisions about the CAFD planning process, including locating and clamping methods and their related element selection.

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} and installation of fixtures {{in a factory}} can be costly, especially for high-volumeproduction runs. Once fixtures are installed, part shape can vary due to: (1) tolerance variations because of inherent imprecision in manufacturing processes, and (2) redesign.

For both cases, it is often desirable to reuse one fixture for all variations of part shape.
