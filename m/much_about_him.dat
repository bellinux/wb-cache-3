5|$|Kerrigan {{returns in}} StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty (2010). At BlizzCon 2007, Chris Metzen {{explained}} {{that in the}} years after Brood War, Kerrigan relocated to Char, pulling back most of the Zerg, and has since been quiet. She has the power to wipe out all her enemies but has not, creating a tense state of peace in the sector. Metzen also indicated an interest in exploring if there was any humanity left in Kerrigan or if she is beyond redemption in her current state. He revealed that Kerrigan's withdrawal {{has little to do with}} any suspicion she has of Duran, who is revealed towards the end of Brood War to be conducting secret experiments on creating a Protoss/Zerg hybrid; she does not know <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> but in the time after Brood War, she is beginning to piece together the puzzle surrounding his motives. At BlizzCon 2008, Kerrigan made two brief appearances in cinematic trailers, one during an attack on a Terran city that was captured on video, and again in a series of caverns where Zeratul was studying ancient runes; in the latter, Kerrigan implies she has been waiting for his arrival.|$|E
25|$|This pencil-slim youngster bowled off-spinners in {{the first}} innings with a highly suspect and jerky action...but no one bothered <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> because of his {{comparatively}} modest success. The balloon really went up in the second innings when he used the new ball...I thought he looked less like a chucker when bowling quick but the M.C.C. were incensed.|$|E
500|$|To be honest, {{one of the}} hesitations I had {{in taking}} on the movie {{is that it was}} a little like writing about the Beatles—that {{there are so many people}} out there who know so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> and who revere him that I just saw a {{minefield}} of disappointment. Frankly, that I was going to do something and that people who ... hopefully, when I'm done with my research, I'll be in the same ball park of knowledge about Steve Jobs that so many people in this room are.|$|E
50|$|Keykubad (died 1348) was the 31st {{ruler of}} Shirvan. He overthrew Mongol rule. There is not <b>much</b> {{information}} <b>about</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
50|$|Victor RoscovichA {{crew member}} who was {{detained}} after {{the engine room}} sabotage. Like Allen, there's not <b>much</b> known <b>about</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
50|$|Farrukhzad II was the 28th {{ruler of}} Shirvan. He was only nominal king, {{therefore}} {{there is not}} <b>much</b> information <b>about</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
500|$|Democratic Party figures {{claimed they}} did not know <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> or his businesses, but {{appreciated}} his support; and he became known to them as someone who could quickly raise large amounts of money, and as someone who networked tirelessly and always found ways to be included in high-profile events. By 2007, Hsu's status within Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign had risen to the level where he was a [...] "HillRaiser", someone who had [...] "bundled" [...] more than $100,000 for her campaign, and to where he co-hosted a $1 million fundraiser at wealthy Democratic Party supporter Ron Burkle's Beverly Hills estate, and in September, he was scheduled to co-host a major gala fundraising event featuring music legend Quincy Jones.|$|E
500|$|Historian Hans Trefousse {{stated in}} a 1969 {{study of the}} Radical Republicans that Stevens's [...] "one abiding passion was equality." [...] In 1991, he noted that Stevens [...] "was {{one of the most}} {{influential}} representatives ever to serve in Congress. [...] the House with his wit, knowledge of parliamentary law, and sheer willpower, even though he was often unable to prevail." [...] In his 1997 biography of Stevens, though, he took a position similar to McKitrick's: that Stevens was a relatively marginal figure, with his influence often limited by his extremism. Trefousse believed that Brodie went too far both in deeming Stevens's clubfoot responsible for so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> and in giving full credence to the Stevens-Smith relationship: both those things cannot now be determined with certainty.|$|E
2500|$|... "We’re hugely {{excited about}} this tour. I think the fans will really like the brand new stage {{production}} and lights... Eddie has changed a bit for this tour but is possibly the most outrageous one to date... I can’t say too <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> as don’t want to spoil the surprise but I guarantee he will scare {{the hell out of}} you!" ...|$|E
50|$|Additionally, <b>much</b> {{information}} <b>about</b> <b>him</b> {{is available}} throughout {{the literature on}} the NFB website, which includes his banquet speeches and other writing.|$|R

6000|$|... "You'll {{like your}} father," [...] he said--"an amiable chap. Never was <b>much</b> push <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> but {{easy to get}} on with. You'll find him artistic and all that." ...|$|R
2500|$|Keith Slater: Slater {{was another}} bowler accused of {{throwing}} during the series, {{but as he}} only took 2 Test wickets for 110 runs he was {{not considered to be}} a major problem. At the MCC's first game in Perth Keith Miller wrote [...] "this pencil-slim youngster bowled off-spinners in the first innings with a highly suspect and jerky action...but no one bothered <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> because of his comparatively modest success. The balloon really went up in the second innings when he used the new ball...I thought he looked less like a chucker when bowling quick but the M.C.C. were incensed".|$|E
2500|$|The Illusive Man is {{described}} as believing [...] "the end justifies the means", and was made to be morally gray. John Jackson Miller, who penned the script for Mass Effect: Evolution, Invasion, and Redemption, personally viewed him as a searcher that saw a [...] "darker side {{to some of the}} great things humanity's discovered", the object of his search. During the course of the games, the writers did not want to reveal too <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> His character development's [...] "basic idea" [...] was [...] "one of these guys we don't know much about". BioWare considered his backstory and motivations, but could not elaborate in the games due to this narrative technique.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] said Dan, {{wondering}} how Mr. Walters knew so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> and {{if these were}} the preliminaries of prosecution.|$|E

6000|$|... "And there wasn't <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> by-and-by. You {{never heard}} a man talk such trash in your life, till Somers put him down." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, mother," [...] cried Henry, [...] "if {{you know}} so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> you must know that, {{whatever}} he was in time past, he is the pirate Durward now." ...|$|E
60|$|To {{the eye of}} the observant Dartie his {{two guests}} {{did not appear to be}} making much running, {{standing}} there close together, without a word. Bosinney was a hungry-looking creature--not <b>much</b> go <b>about</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|His mother, wot had 'ad the pub afore 'im, 'ad brought 'im up {{very quiet}} and genteel, {{and when she}} died 'e went and married a fine, {{handsome}} young woman who 'ad got her eye on the pub without thinking <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>'im.</b> I got {{to know about it}} through knowing the servant that lived there. A nice, quiet gal she was, and there wasn't much went on that she didn't hear. I've known 'er to cry for hours with the ear-ache, pore gal.|$|R

6000|$|... 'I mean,' said Jonas, stooping {{down over}} the body, 'that I never heard you were his father, or had any {{particular}} reason to care <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> Halloa. Hold up there!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} that a Mr. Crewe is a candidate, but I do not know <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> They tell me he is a summer {{resident}} at Leith."--The Honourable Hilary Vane.|$|E

6000|$|... "Because {{he is to}} be one of the {{speakers}} at a big meeting that night. Have you seen him since you got home, Jinny? He is thinner than he was. We are <b>much</b> worried <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> because he has worked so hard this summer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know as <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> as a {{woman can}} know of a man she doesn't know,--and all from yourself. You have {{said over and over}} again that he is a 'rascal!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No: I {{believe he}} is a very good sort of fellow,' said Lord Valentine; 'at least my people always say so. I do not know <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> for they never go anywhere.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll have {{to confess}} I don't know <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> Mrs. Spence," [...] he said, [...] "except {{that he has been}} in Congress, {{and is one of the}} {{prominent}} lawyers of that state." ...|$|E
60|$|Gillie's {{opinion in}} regard to the madness of Lewis was shared by several of his friends above stairs.
