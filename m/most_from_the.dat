5|$|On {{the other}} side of the field, Air Force had the No. 2 rushing offense in the country during the 1984 regular season. Air Force fullback Pat Evans led the team with 159carries for 1,015rushing yards. Air Force quarterback Bart Weiss also was known more for his running than his passing. Weiss {{finished}} the regular season with just 41completions for 668yards and threetouchdowns. He carried the ball 126times for 540yards and 10touchdowns. Wide receiver Ken Carpenter benefited the <b>most</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> few passes that were thrown. He had 15catches for 258yards and twotouchdowns during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|Several {{teaching}} {{guides and}} books of study notes {{have been published}} to help teachers and students gain the <b>most</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> book. The Hobbit introduces literary concepts, notably allegory, to young readers, as the work has been seen to have allegorical aspects reflecting {{the life and times}} of the author. Meanwhile, the author himself rejected an allegorical reading of his work. This tension can help introduce readers to readerly and writerly interpretations, to tenets of New Criticism, and critical tools from Freudian analysis, such as sublimation, in approaching literary works.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a three-month}} course at Staff College, Camberley, Garrett was {{appointed}} commandant of the Staff College, Queenscliff, Victoria, in June 1946. He was posted to Japan in March 1947, becoming Brigadier-in-Charge of Administration for the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in July. The {{size and scope}} of the occupation declined considerably during his tour, which finished in October 1949. Approximately 2,400 Australians, <b>most</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 67th Battalion, remained by late 1948, compared to 11,000 in October 1946. In December 1949, Garrett resumed command of the Staff College, Queenscliff. Promoted temporary major general, he was appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) Western Command, which covered the state of Western Australia, in August 1951. He became Deputy Chief of the General Staff in February 1953.|$|E

5|$|On 1 September, IV Corps began {{operations}} {{designed to}} capture Bancourt Ridge {{and allow the}} advance to continue. Under the cover of an artillery barrage, the 42nd Division, New Zealand Division, and 5th Division, {{from right to left}} respectively, would begin advancing at 4:55 am. As had frequently happened during the battle, the New Zealanders found themselves ahead of the flanking divisions. The New Zealand Rifle Brigade swiftly made the crest of the ridge, taking 70 prisoners. The 1st Infantry Brigade was a little slower; the 1st Wellington Battalion made the crest and consolidated itself there. The other battalion, 2nd Auckland, despite the assistance of two tanks, was unable to do the same. Operating on the extreme flank of the New Zealand Division's sector of the front, it suffered the <b>most</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lack of progress of the 42nd Division and was unable hold its portion of the crest. That evening, the 2nd Infantry Brigade moved into the line, replacing both the New Zealand Rifle Brigade and 1st Infantry Brigade.|$|E
5|$|There are 29 National Treasures of 14 {{collections}} of waka and two works on waka style, compiled {{from between the}} 8th and the mid-13th century with <b>most</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Heian period. The two works of waka theory are Wakatai jisshu (945) and Korai fūteishō (1197). The collections include the two first imperial waka anthologies: Kokinshū (905, ten treasures) and Gosen Wakashū (951); seven private anthologies: Man'yōshū (after 759, three treasures), Shinsō Hishō (1008), Nyūdō Udaijin-shū (before 1065), Sanjūrokunin Kashū (ca. 1112), Ruijū Koshū (before 1120), Shūi Gusō (1216), Myōe Shōnin Kashū (1248); and five utaawase contents: including one imaginary content (Kasen utaawase), the Konoe edition of the Poetry Match in Ten Scrolls (three treasures), Ruijū utaawase, the Poetry competition in 29 rounds at Hirota Shrine and the Record of Poetry Match in Fifteen Rounds. The designated manuscripts of these works found in this list date from the Heian and Kamakura periods.|$|E

Tens of thousands of Fordsons, <b>most</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> U.S. and some from Ireland, were exported to the Soviet Union from 1920 to 1927.

25|$|The EAC negotiates {{with trade}} {{partners}} {{on behalf of}} all member countries. Negotiations in 2014 for an EU-EAC Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) ran into difficulties with the January 2014 negotiating session failing to conclude the negotiations, which were scheduled to be completed before 1 October 2014. This caused tensions between Kenya and other countries as Kenya, which is not a Least Developed Country, stood to lose <b>most</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> failure to reach agreement. Discussions are also under way between the EAC and the USA on the launch of Trade and Investment Partnership (TIP) negotiations.|$|E
25|$|This is in {{most cases}} conjectural, as most {{auxiliary}} regiments were founded in the Julio-Claudian era (ante 68), while {{the vast majority of}} datable auxiliary records date from the Flavian era onwards (post 70), and of these <b>most</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 2nd century. However, the foundation period can be inferred from other evidence e.g. numeration sequence e.g. Cohors VII Raetorum is attested in the year 38 AD. From this it can be inferred that all the Raetorum cohorts with a lower number than VII were also in existence by that date, and so were almost certainly founded in the Augustus/Tiberius period.|$|E
25|$|Poor {{whites and}} landless former slaves {{suffered}} the <b>most</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> postwar economic depression. The constitutional convention of early 1868 appointed {{a committee to}} recommend what was needed for relief {{of the state and}} its citizens. The committee found severe destitution among the laboring classes. It took years for the state to rebuild levees damaged in battles. The upset of the commodity system impoverished the state after the war. By 1868 an increased cotton crop began to show possibilities for free labor in the state, but the crop of 565,000 bales produced in 1870 was still less than half of prewar figures.|$|E

25|$|In {{the sphere}} of economics, World War II marks a turning point. Because Flanders had been widely devastated {{during the war and}} had been largely {{agricultural}} since the Belgian uprising, it benefited <b>most</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Marshall Plan. Its standing as an economically backward agricultural region meant that it obtained support from Belgium's membership of the European Union and its predecessors. At the same time, Wallonia experienced a slow relative decline as the products of its mines and mills came to be less in demand. The economic balance between the two parts of the country has remained less in favour of Wallonia than it was before 1939.|$|E
25|$|In the 1968–73 period, {{personal}} income became more concentrated and regional disparities became greater. Industrial expansion took place more vigorously in the Center-South Region, which had benefited <b>most</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> import substitution industrialization strategy. Its per-capita income considerably exceeded the national average, its infrastructure was more developed, {{and it had}} an adequate supply of skilled workers and professionals. The region was therefore {{able to take advantage}} of the opportunities and incentives offered by the military regime. Although a special regional development strategy existed for the Northeast, it promoted a distorted industrialization that benefited only a few of that region's large cities; the Northeast's linkages with the Center-South were stronger than its linkages within the region. The combination of a harsh climate, a highly concentrated land-tenure system, and an elite that consistently resisted meaningful change prevented the Northeast from developing effectively.|$|E
25|$|One {{approach}} {{considers the}} problem {{from the perspective of}} who benefits <b>most</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> public good. This approach is sensitive to the fact that different preferences exist between different income classes. The public good is viewed in a similar way as a private good, where those who use the public good must pay for it. Some people will benefit more from the public good than others, thus creating inequalities in the absence of benefit taxes. A difficulty with public goods is determining who exactly benefits from the public good, although some estimates of the distribution of {{the costs and benefits of}} global warming have been made – see above. Additionally, this approach does not provide guidance as to how the surplus of benefits from climate policy should be shared.|$|E

25|$|Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) {{have been}} agreed upon by ASEAN for eight professions: physicians, dentists, nurses, architects, engineers, accountants, surveyors, and tourism professionals. Individuals in these professions will be free to work in any ASEAN nation after the AEC goes into effect on 31 December 2015. Applicants must be {{licensed}} and recognised professionals in these fields in their home countries. They can move to other ASEAN countries to practice, but they must pass that country's licensing test. In Thailand, licensing tests {{will be in the}} Thai language. In addition, one cannot be an independent practitioner. Any foreign professional intending to work must collaborate with a local business. Given these hurdles, it is unlikely that there will be significant migrations of professionals in the near-term. A Chulalongkorn University study predicts that more developed countries stand to benefit the <b>most</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> free flow of professionals.|$|E
25|$|Several {{factors were}} {{incorporated}} into the compact Nash Rambler's marketing mix that including making the <b>most</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> limited steel supplies during the Korean War, {{as well as the}} automaker selecting a strategy for profit maximization from the new Rambler line. The new Nash Rambler came only in a convertible body, a style that had a higher price in the marketplace and incorporating more standard features that make the open top models suitable more for leisure-type use than ordinary transportation. With a base price of $1,808 (equivalent to approximately $ in today's funds), the Nash Rambler was priced slightly lower than the base convertible models from its intended competition. To further increase the value to buyers, the Nash Rambler was well equipped compared to the competition and included numerous items as standard equipment such as whitewall tires, full wheel covers, electric clock, and even a pushbutton AM radio that were available at extra cost on all other cars at that time.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the failure}} of the British to take Louisbourg in 1757, a second attempt was planned in 1758 and command given to General Jeffrey Amherst. Although Louisbourg did not control entry to the St Lawrence River, it could not simply be bypassed, and the British decided it must be taken before they could proceed further. After a 44-day siege, the city finally capitulated. One of the figures who benefited <b>most</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{campaign}} was a young British brigadier, James Wolfe, who so impressed Pitt that he was promoted and given command of future expeditions in Canada. Despite their victory at Louisbourg, the British decided to wait for the spring before heading further up the St Lawrence. In the meantime the river was extensively charted by a naval officer, James Cook, later to become famous as an explorer. Despatches carrying news of the victory sparked euphoria in Britain, and were celebrated by numerous bonfires.|$|E
