25|$|The Austrian {{covering}} force was entrenched and though Clerfayt was in nominal command, Coburg {{was on the}} scene and in control of the battle. Coburg was so certain of success that he was supposed to have said that if he were defeated, he would become a sans-culotte. This story <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>rounds</b> in the French army and made its soldiers eager to make the Coalition commander wear trousers.|$|E
25|$|The {{improbable}} {{run of the}} Drillers had <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>rounds</b> in the media, and {{coinciding with}} the poor season the Oilers were having, suddenly the Drillers were the flavour of the month in Edmonton. This {{was evident in the}} stands as the largest regular season crowd in Drillers history took in the regular season finale March 29, where they defeated the Rockers 7–4 in front of a boisterous 9,136 patrons. The win gave the Drillers a 21–19 record for the year, and a first round playoff date with the Milwaukee Wave.|$|E
25|$|Padilla once <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>rounds</b> {{in social}} media when he cursed and {{allegedly}} walked out at a free concert in Ilagan City after a group of alleged hecklers flashed him the middle finger, while performing on stage. However, he did not walk out, and immediately apologized when {{he went back to}} perform. Padilla is also admired for displaying remarkable maturity at such a young age. For example, he turned down an offer to play in the developmental league of the Philippine Basketball Association because he felt that his inclusion was merely based on his popularity as an actor. However, D-League director Eric Castro said he was eligible to join the league because he is a student of AMA.|$|E

25|$|With the {{disappearance}} of his father, young Gleason began hanging around with a local gang, hustling pool. He attended P.S. 73 Elementary School in Brooklyn; John Adams High School in Queens; and Bushwick High School in Brooklyn. Gleason became interested in performing after {{being part of a}} class play; he quit school before graduating and got a job that paid $4 per night as master of ceremonies at a theater. Other jobs he held at that time included working in a pool hall, as a stunt driver, and as a carnival barker. Gleason and his friends <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>rounds</b> of the local theaters; he put an act together with one of his friends, and the pair performed on amateur night at the Halsey Theater, where Gleason replaced his friend Sammy Birch as master of ceremonies. He performed the same duties twice a week at the Folly Theater.|$|E
25|$|On 12 August 1793 Vendeans under Charette, Elbée and Lescure joined Royrand's men at Chantonnay. Warned by his scouts, Tuncq {{arranged}} 9,000 {{troops and}} 31 {{guns on the}} hills outside Luçon. In the Battle of Luçon on 14 August 1793, between 14,000 and 35,000 rebels attacked the Republicans on an open plain unfavorable to Vendean tactics. Because the three assaulting columns were poorly coordinated, the Royalists were beaten with losses of 1,500 men and 18 field pieces. Tuncq occupied Chantonnay but soon returned to Luçon, leaving René François Lecomte and Marceau in charge of 7,000 troops in an exposed position. Back in army command Rossignol <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>rounds</b> of his divisions, rebuking his generals for not cooperating. He ordered the Luçon division to sweep {{the country to the}} west and keep touch with the Sables d'Olonne division. He also ordered Chalbos to capture La Châtaigneraie. On 2 September a council of war at Saumur decided to reinforce Canclaux's army with 16,000 veterans from the Army of Mainz under Jean-Baptiste Annibal Aubert du Bayet and make the main thrust into the Vendée from Nantes. Significantly, du Bayet's officers refused to serve under the political appointee Rossignol. The arrival of Canclaux's army at Legé around 11–13 September would be the signal for the six divisions of the La Rochelle army to advance. However, the result of a battle would throw these plans out of joint. On 5 September 1793, 20,000 Whites smashed 8,000 Blues in the Battle of Chantonnay inflicting 4,000 casualties for the loss of only 500 men. Another authority asserted that the Vendeans had 25,000 men and 21 guns, and that only 2,500 of the 7,000 Republicans escaped the defeat.|$|E

500|$|... "Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Irving Berlin in 1918 that gives a comic {{perspective}} on military life. Berlin composed the song {{as an expression of}} protest against the indignities of Army routine shortly after being drafted into the United States Army in 1918. [...] The song soon <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>rounds</b> of camp and became popular with other soldiers, partly because hatred of reveille was universal.|$|E

In March, 1901, he obtained $150,000 ($ in today's dollars) from J.

Although the stories of Blaine's favors to the railroads had <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>rounds</b> eight years earlier, this time Blaine's correspondence was discovered, making his earlier denials less plausible.

500|$|The {{campaign}} {{focused on}} the candidates' personalities, as each candidate’s supporters cast aspersions on their opponents. Cleveland’s supporters rehashed the old allegations from the Mulligan letters that Blaine had corruptly influenced legislation in favor of railroads, later profiting {{on the sale of}} bonds he owned in both companies. Although the stories of Blaine’s favors to the railroads had <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>rounds</b> eight years earlier, this time more of his correspondence was discovered, making his earlier denials less plausible. Blaine acknowledged that the letters were genuine, but denied that anything in them impugned his integrity or contradicted his earlier explanations. Nevertheless, what Blaine described as “stale slander” served to focus the public’s attention negatively on his character. On some of the most damaging correspondence, Blaine had written “Burn this letter," [...] giving Democrats the last line to their rallying cry: “Blaine, Blaine, James G.

2500|$|The {{matter is}} {{complicated}} by the fact that Shakespeare failed twice to pay his taxes for St Helen's parish, Bishopsgate, London, where he is listed by name for the year 1596/7, and he is not among those “in any of the annual lists of residents of the Clink parish (St Saviour’s) compiled by the officers who <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>rounds</b> to collect tokens purchased by churchgoers for Easter Communion, which was compulsory.” An explanation is offered by historian Walter Godfrey, who suggests that the playwright's default at Bishopsgate was simply because he had moved to the Clink parish at the end of that year, where taxes were collected by the landowner (the bishop of Winchester) and not parish officials. The bishop then remitted the outstanding sum to Shakespeare's former parish [...] "as a matter of convenience".|$|E
2500|$|As {{his gang}} {{branched}} out into {{bigger and more}} complicated [...] "big cons" [...] that attracted a more well-to-do clientele, Lou Blonger found he no longer needed his saloon and the relatively small take it provided from card and dice games. Eventually he moved into headquarters in the American National Bank building on Seventeenth Street and styled himself as a mining magnate. A crucial moment {{in the development of}} the bunco gang was Blonger's partnership in 1904 with Adolph W. Duff, who had operated his own gang of confidence men in Colorado Springs before being run out of town by the police. With Duff handling the details of coordinating gang members and scheduling locations for the scams, Blonger was free to conduct the business of schmoozing public officials and bribing law enforcement, all while cultivating the image of a model citizen. In the summertime he <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>rounds</b> of friendly politicians and policemen, paying off favors with boxes of cherries from his orchard in suburban Lakewood.|$|E
