50|$|In the 20th century, the {{anthracite}} industry {{remained the}} largest {{industry in the}} Lackawanna River region, though {{there was also a}} silk and textile industry. Additionally, agriculture remained a significant industry in the watershed into the early 20th century. However, the Great Depression of the 1930s caused a decline in mining activity. <b>Mine</b> <b>pumping</b> in the watershed ceased by 1961 and underground mining in the watershed ended on November 1, 1966, with the closing of the Continental Mine. Nevertheless, a small amount of strip mining and re-mining of previously mined sites has been done since the 1960s. By this point, the valley's railroad system was shrinking due to decreased coal shipments.|$|E

5000|$|Lean's Engine Reporter {{was founded}} in 1810 to {{publicize}} the performances of different Cornish engines used for <b>mine</b> <b>pumping</b> in Cornwall. The first Reporter of Duty was Joel Lean. The Reporter, published monthly, gave, for each engine and its pumps, the number of strokes (measured by a counter kept in a locked box), {{and the amount of}} coal used. From this, and sizes of the pumps, the engine duty was found: this was the number of pounds of water raised one foot by a bushel of coal. Between 1810 and 1840 this reporting, and competition between engineers, raised the duty from around 20 million to 90 million pounds, a much higher efficiency than found in engines elsewhere at the same time. The improvements were an increase in the steam pressure used, full expansion to low pressure, and insulation to avoid heat loss.|$|E
50|$|Iron Mountain {{was once}} a mining city when the Chapin Mine was up and running. The land that the Chapin Mine was formed on was {{discovered}} in 1879. It was discovered by two men, James John Hagerman and Dr. Nelson Powell Hulst. They had leased the land from a man from Niles, Michigan, Henry Chapin, hence {{the name of the}} mine. They began to sink shafts on the slope of Millie Hill. Then on July 5, 1879, Captain John Wicks and seven other men were sent into the forest with a wagon filled with tools to search for a place to set up camp. After numerous unsuccessful shafts the company was ready to shut down operation. Hagerman and Hulst had faith in the land and tried one more shaft. The shaft was 90 ft deep and many months later, there was a successful hit that {{was at the heart of}} the iron ore. The original land was very swampy and filled with trees. To get rid of all this water the Chapin <b>Mine</b> <b>Pumping</b> Engine was created.|$|E

5000|$|The old ferry {{crossings}} {{were later}} {{to develop into}} the busy river quays of {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries. In mediaeval times the transport of goods to supply the Benedictine abbey at Tavistock, four miles by track from the river port of Morwellham, was significant. Sea sand from the coast was imported to spread on farmland, until in the eighteenth century a dressing of lime was found to be more beneficial. Large quantities of limestone and coal were then imported to burn in the numerous limekilns on the river quays; the lime had to be made locally as it was not slaked before application and was too reactive for transport by water after burning. Later, street sweepings and other refuse from Plymouth and Devonport, together with bones for the newly discovered bone fertiliser, were carried inland to manure the fields. Other regular imports were timber from British Columbia and the Baltic, in large baulks for use as supports in the mines, and coal from Wales to supply the <b>mine</b> <b>pumping</b> engines.Tavistock was one of the three stannary towns of Devon and large quantities of refined tin ore were exported through Morwellham from twelfth century until 1838, when the requirement to pay duty on the metal at one of the specified towns was relaxed. The opening of the Tavistock Canal, between Tavistock and Morwellham, in 1817 facilitated traffic. Later, the East Cornwall Mineral Railway provided an outlet through the quays of Calstock from the Cornish side of the valley. [...] Other significant cargoes exported were quarried granite and, later, copper, lead and manganese ores, with their important by-product of arsenic. Arsenic was extracted from mispickel, once regarded as a waste product but later offering an important source of revenue as copper and tin extraction declined in profitability. The refined product was exported worldwide, in particular to the southern United States, where it was used as an insecticide in the cotton fields.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Spreadsheets {{were used}} for {{predicting}} stream salinities in the Yampa River watershed. The concentration of total dissolved solids (TDS) represents salinity. The spreadsheets calculate TDS at 22 locations by summing the flowweighted TDS values upstream from each point. The flow-weighted TDS values were compiled from publicly available monitoring data and from predicted future mining inputs. This spreadsheet method provides only a rough prediction of TDS concentrations {{because it does not}} precisely account for non-mining sources like irrigation and municipal runoff. Also, significant error is introduced by the differences in sampling times between locations. Spreadsheets were developed for eight different scenarios with various combinations of moisture conditions (precipitation), season (flow), and pumping of underground mine water to the surface. Calculated TDS values were posted on a GIS map of the watershed for visualizing mining impacts along stream segments. The eight scenarios for the spreadsheets predict the largest percentage increase in TDS occurs when there is uncontrolled <b>mine</b> <b>pumping</b> in a relatively dry year during low seasonal stream flow.

40|$|Pilot {{heat pump}} {{systems have been}} {{installed}} at two former collieries in Yorkshire/Derbyshire, England, to extract heat from mine water. The installations represent three fundamental configurations of heat exchanger. At Caphouse Colliery, mine water is pumped through a heat exchanger coupled to a heat pump and then discharged to waste (an open-loop heat exchange system). The system performs with high thermal efficiency, but the drawbacks are: (1) {{it can only be}} operated when mine water is being actively pumped from the colliery shaft for the purposes of regional water-level management, and (2) the fact that the water is partially oxygenated means that iron oxyhydroxide precipitation occurs, necessitating regular removal of filters for cleaning. At Markham Colliery, near Bolsover, a small amount of mine water is pumped from depth in a flooded shaft, circulated through a heat exchanger coupled to a heat pump and then returned to the same mine shaft at a slightly different depth (a standing column arrangement). This system’s fundamental thermal efficiency is negatively impacted by the electrical power required to run the shaft submersible pump, but clogging issues are not significant. In the third system, at Caphouse, a heat exchanger is submerged in a mine water treatment pond (a closed-loop system). This can be run at any time, irrespective of <b>mine</b> <b>pumping</b> regime, and being a closed-loop system, is not susceptible to clogging issues...|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this study was to do an energy cost {{optimisation}} on a specific complex <b>mine</b> <b>pumping</b> system by means of load shift. A Real-Time Energy Management System (REMS) was installed on the mine and the pumps were controlled according to certain constraints. The results that were obtained were very satisfactory. This project was undertaken on Elandsrand Mine and was a part of Eskom's Demand Side Management (DSM) initiative. Eskom fully finances these load shifting projects to encourage Energy Savings Companies (ESCOs) to undertake load shift projects in order to reduce the national peak demand profile. The project entailed doing a detailed investigation of the mine's pumping system. The pumping system was analysed and simulated according to specific constraints that were specified by the mine. After the simulation was completed, an optimisation on this simulation was done and the pumping system was fully automated to react to the changing electricity tariff. This automation led to a successful load-shifting project. Load shift means that the demand, during peak periods, is decreased. This is done by moving the energy requirement to another time of day when the demand and therefore the cost is less. However, the total energy used for the day remains the same. Load shift decreases the energy demand during the peak periods and at the same time generate savings for the relevant energy user. The average load shift that was obtained for the 5 months (June -November 2004) was 3. 66 MW. This load shift has resulted in an average monthly cost saving for the mine of R 60 000. This project showed that with the necessary historical data and expertise, a load shifting project, and therefore a cost optimisation project, can be successfully implemented on a mine's pumping system. This method can also be successfully applied to other electrical components on the mineMaster...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. Electricity cost of {{buildings}} {{is a major}} expense for building owners. Improvements in the efficient utilisation of energy is therefore of concern to this economic sector. Unfortunately, existing energy audit tools are costly and time-consuming which militates against their common usage. The {{aim of this study}} was to create software that would reduce the time taken to perform a building audit. In that way it would encourage more building owners to carry out such audits. This would enable them to save electrical energy (and therefore costs) through retrofit projects in existing buildings. As a result, both the economy as well as the environment will benefit. This objective was reached by means of the design, implementation and integration of three software modules for a building-software package called Building ESCO Toolbox (BETB). The modules were integrated into a new building energy audit protocol that reduces the average time of a building audit from 45 days to 17 days. The work in this study was thoroughly verified by means of actual implementation at the CSIR conference centre, the Carlton building in the Johannesburg CBD and the TSI research facility of ESKOM. The first BETB software module is called the Palm Data Logger and captures the required building audit data. This reduces the data-gathering time from 10 to 4 days. The second module, the Financial Analysis Tool reduces the creation of financial analysis information from 2 days to 1 day. The third software module is called the Report Generation Tool and it compiles a final auditor report from all the BETB study data in one day as compared to the traditional three. A secondary aim {{of this study was to}} design a suitable solution for an improved <b>mine</b> <b>pumping</b> maintenance-information-systems. This product was called the On-Site Information Management System (OSIMS) and it was approved of by relevant personnel at the Anglo Gold Kopanang mine. OSIMS acts as support for the mine software, which is called Remote Energy Management System (EMS). It optimises mine water pump schedules in a way that avoids using peak time electricity. OSIMS consists of an electronic data-logging device that successfully solves four key problem areas of the current system at Kopanang. Firstly, OSIMS reduces the loss of maintenance data. Secondly, the OSIMS system increases the probability that maintenance audits are conducted in the correct fashion. Thirdly, it reduces time spent on documentation and, fourthly, it leads to greater data integrity for the Computer Maintenance Management Information System at Kopanang. In both cases, all the software developments were carried out in a logical engineering fashion. Each software module was first defined and then planned. The required equipment was selected and acquired and all the technical knowledge was integrated. Program development was then conducted. All the needed peripheral program capability was also developed before the verification and validation was done. The modules were then integrated into the overall product. Master...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Electrical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. Eskom, {{the sole}} {{supplier}} of electricity in South Africa is facing an energy crisis. This {{is due to}} the steady increase in demand for electricity in South Africa. Low electricity prices in South Africa have helped the energy intensive industries of South Africa to be more competitive. Unfortunately this has resulted in poor energy efficiency practices and has hampered incentives to save energy. To address this problem, Eskom initiated a Demand Side Management (DSM) programme. DSM is beneficial to both Eskom and the client. However, due to the high cost of implementing such projects, it is feasible to implement it only on sites where the load shift potential is high enough for Eskom to benefit. The mining industry has been targeted for DSM programmes. This {{is due to the}} existence of a large mining sector in South Africa and to its energy intensive nature. Most mining operations require large amounts of water which is used to cool the underground environment and so ensure productivity and the safety of the workers. Due to the large amounts of water needed for mining, the electricity usage of these pumping systems is very high. If the use of this electricity can be optimised by implementing DSM principles, this will result in the long term savings of costs for the mines involved. The majority of pumping systems found on mines are single shaft systems. Individually these systems have a very high DSM potential. However, if multiple shaft systems can be used for DSM, the benefits will be far greater. Furthermore, combining several sites with an interconnected water pumping system will increase the potential for DSM and enable sites where individually the potential is too low to be feasible for a DSM project to raise their potential. This will result in more sites where DSM projects can be implemented and more clients who can benefit from the DSM programme. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate and implement a DSM project on an intricate multi-shaft <b>mine</b> <b>pumping</b> system which will be controlled from a single point. The project required a detailed investigation of the pumping systems on each shaft and how the water system is interlinked between the shafts. This project was carried out on Beatrix Mine Shafts 1, 2 and 3. The pumping systems were analysed and simulated according to the specific constraints and requirements that were specified by the mine. During the investigation and implementation of this project, possible efficiency improvements on certain pump stations were discovered and implemented. The improvements enabled both an increase in water flow to the surface and a decrease in power consumption. Due to this load reduction, the savings achieved were higher than those found in most load shifting projects. Moreover, additional infrastructures were installed to ensure communication between pumping systems. Once the simulation and optimisation of the control system was completed, the pumping system network was automated. The load shift resulted in a ± 3. 5 MW shift in the morning peak demand period and a ± 6. 0 MW shift in the evening peak demand period. This load shift has resulted in an average cost saving of R 80 000 per month during summer tariff period, and R 300 000 per month during winter tariff period. This saving result was calculated by taking load reduction into account. This project has shown that a DSM project can be implemented successfully, given the necessary historical data and expertise, on a pumping system that is interconnected between multiple shafts.
