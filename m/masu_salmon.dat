40|$|Abstract- Previous {{tests of}} ideal free {{distribution}} (IFD) under continuous input condi-tions {{have demonstrated that}} more profitable patches tend to be relatively underused compared to that predicted by the theory. We tested the hypothesis that competitors' perceptual constraints of resource distribution cause this deviation from the IFD. A laboratory experiment was conducted to determine whether additional information on food distribution by a light cue that indicates the food input point improves the IFD theory's fit to the distribution of clone red-spotted <b>masu</b> <b>salmons</b> (Salmonids), Oncorhyn-chus masou ishikawai, that had been conditioned to the light as a cue indicating the site with a higher input rate. In the treatments without a light cue, the distribution of fish was closer to a random pattern than an IFD. In contrast, in the treatments with light cue, the distribution of fish was closer to the expected value of an IFD rather than to a random pattern, supporting the perception-limit hypothesis. The distribution and the pattern of resource use by fish in the treatments without the light cue were best explained by the perception-limit model. Our results {{suggest that it is}} perceptual constraints that cause de-viation from the IFD...|$|R
40|$|Detection {{survey on}} Aeromonas salmonicida was {{conducted}} from the coelomic fluid of 420 mature chum (Oncorhynchus keta), 120 pink (O. gorbuscha), and 180 <b>masu</b> (O. masou) <b>salmon</b> which have no clinical signs of furunculosis, in 1989 in Hokkaido. A. salmonicida was isolated from 22 out of 120 chum salmon from the Tokachi River. The number of A. salmonicida in the coelomic fluid ranged from 10 ^ 1 to 10 ^ 6 CFU/ml in the samples from Shibetsu and Teshio rivers, respectively. It is {{suspected that the}} coelomic fluid contaminated with A. salmonicida flows out from the fish {{at the time of}} stripping eggs or during maturation in the pond.

40|$|Abstract: Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) play an {{important}} role as keystone species and as ecosystem services in the North Pacific ecosystem. Our objective is to evaluate the trends in and causes of variation in run size and carrying capacity of Pacific salmon, and to predict their future production dynamics. Salmon catch data indicate that the abundance of Pacific salmon has declined {{since the end of the}} twentieth century, despite the healthy condition of stocks. At the beginning of the 21 st century, chum (O. keta) and pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) maintained high abundance commensurate with a sharp increase in hatchery-released populations. However, sockeye salmon (O. nerka) have shown a reduction trend since the late 1990 s. The abundance of coho (O. kisutch), Chinook (O. tshawytscha), and <b>masu</b> (O. masou) <b>salmon,</b> which spend more than one year in fresh water, has declined sharply since the 1980 s due to degraded environmental conditions in freshwater habitats (e. g., habitat loss, urbanization, and river channelization). The significant positive correlation between the carrying capacity (K) of three species (sockeye, chum, and pink salmon), defined as the replacement level of Ricker’s recruitment curve, and the Aleutian Low Pressure Index (ALPI) indicate that their carrying capacity is synchronous with long-term trends in climate change. The carrying capacity of the three species is expected to continue the downward trend seen since the 1998 / 99 regime shift...|$|R

The river basin {{is also home to}} the largest population of a rare salmonid species - Sakhalin taimen. The Anadromous salmon (pink, masu, chum, and the less abundant coho) comprise a substantial part of the river biomass. The pink salmon stock is the largest, comprising 10% of the total population of pink salmon of the Russian mainland Sea of Japan coast. <b>Masu</b> <b>salmon</b> stocks rank second after pinks, and char are fairly abundant.|$|E
5000|$|The amago or the red-spotted <b>masu</b> <b>salmon</b> (Oncorhynchus masou macrostomus) is a salmonid fish {{endemic to}} western Japan, and a {{subspecies}} {{of the more}} widespread Northwest Pacific <b>masu</b> <b>salmon</b> or cherry salmon (Oncorhynchus masou). [...] It is distinguished {{by the presence of}} red or vermilion spots on the body along with black ones, while the nominate form O. masou masou, known as the yamame, only has black ones. The amago is distributed in western Japan, on the Pacific side of the Honshu and Shikoku islands, and on the Inland Sea of Japan side of Kyushu. The subspecies is a subject of aquaculture. It can grow up to 50 cm length.|$|E
50|$|<b>Masu</b> <b>salmon</b> or {{cherry salmon}} (Oncorhynchus masou) are {{found only in}} the western Pacific Ocean in Japan, Korea, and Russia. A land-locked {{subspecies}} known as the Taiwanese salmon or Formosan salmon (Oncorhynchus masou formosanus) is found in central Taiwan's Chi Chia Wan Stream.|$|E
50|$|A <b>masu</b> <b>salmon</b> {{which has}} reached sexual {{maturity}} has a darkened back, and the stripes {{on the body}} sides become bright red with crimson tinge to merge on the abdomen into one common longitudinal band of lighter color. For this reason,it was given the name cherry salmon.|$|E
5000|$|As adults, <b>masu</b> <b>salmon</b> tend {{to weigh}} 2.0 to 2.5 kg and measure roughly 50 cm in length. [...] The maximum size {{that can be}} {{attained}} by this species (which is {{in the region of}} Primorsky Krai) is 71 cm long and 9 kg in weight.|$|E
50|$|The Biwa trout (Oncorhynchus rhodurus) is an {{anadromous}} salmonid fish of {{the genus}} Oncorhynchus, endemic to Lake Biwa in Shiga Prefecture, Japan, but also introduced to Lake Ashi and Lake Chūzenji.

50|$|The iwame trout or markless trout is {{a variety}} of salmonid fish inhabiting some fresh waters of Japan. It is an intra-specific mutant morph of the <b>masu</b> <b>salmon</b> (Oncorhynchus masou) that is {{characterized}} by a lack of the lateral spot marks typical of the young fish in most populations. The iwame is a stream-resident morph that does not migrate to the sea. It occurs together with the standard phenotype in some populations. This morph is recessively inherited.|$|E
50|$|In March 2012 up to 18,700 becquerels per {{kilogram}} radioactive cesium {{was detected}} in yamame, or landlocked <b>masu</b> <b>salmon,</b> {{caught in the}} Niida river near the town Iitate, which was over 37 times the legal limit of 500 becquerels/kg.

5000|$|Waxworms may be store-bought or {{raised by}} anglers. Anglers and fishing bait shops often {{refer to the}} larvae as [...] "waxies". They are used for {{catching}} some varieties of panfish, members of the sunfish family (Centrarchidae), Green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus) {{and can be used}} for shallow water fishing {{with the use of a}} lighter weight. They are also used for fishing some members of the Salmonidae family, <b>Masu</b> <b>salmon</b> (Oncorhynchus masou), white-spotted char (Salvelinus leucomaenis), and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).|$|E
50|$|After spawning, most passing fish die, {{and those}} that remain alive (preferentially dwarf males) {{participate}} in spawning the next year, too. Emerging from the nest, the young do not roll into the sea, but remain in spawning areas, in {{the upper reaches of}} rivers, and on shallows with weak currents. The young move to pools and rolls of the river core to feed on chironomid, stone fly, and may fly larvae, and on airborne insects. The <b>masu</b> <b>salmon</b> rolls into the sea in its second, or occasionally even third year of life.|$|E
50|$|The Formosan {{landlocked}} salmon is a subspecies {{of the more}} widespread West-Pacific cherry salmon (or <b>masu</b> <b>salmon).</b> This Taiwanese subspecies is critically endangered, being {{at high risk for}} extinction, and is protected in its native habitat. The Formosan land-locked salmon is one of the rarest fish in the world. Once a staple of the Taiwanese aborigine diet, there are now barely more than 400 of this type of salmon left. Overfishing has led to its decline. Conservationists are trying to save this subspecies which is threatened nowadays mainly by pollution.|$|E
5000|$|Like other Pacific salmon, its {{lifecycle}} is {{subdivided into}} marine and freshwater periods; in rivers, this species lives from 1 to 3 years and can form living freshwater forms. The sea lifecycle, {{depending on the}} age of the young, continues for 2.0 to 3.5 years. In the sea, the <b>masu</b> <b>salmon</b> feeds intensely on crustaceans, less often on young fish. On attaining sexual maturity, in its third to seventh years of life, it enters rivers to spawn. Its spawning run starts earlier than that of other salmon species.|$|E
5000|$|Oncorhynchus masou, {{known as}} the <b>masu</b> <b>salmon,</b> masu, or the cherry salmon, is a species of salmon found in the Western Pacific Ocean along East Asia, ranging from the Kamchatka, Kuril Islands, Sakhalin, and Primorsky Krai south through Korea, Taiwan, and Japan. A number of {{subspecies}} are known, including the anadromous, widespread masu Oncorhynchus masou masou (e.g. in Korea, Japan), the critically endangered, landlocked Taiwanese or Formosan salmon Oncorhynchus masou formosanus found in certain freshwater systems of Taiwan, the Biwa trout endemic of Lake Biwa, and the anadromous or stream-dwelling amago Oncorhynchus masou macrostomus restricted to western Japan.|$|E
50|$|There are 46 native {{fish species}} and {{subspecies}} in the lake, including 11 species and 5 subspecies that are endemic or near-endemic. The endemic species are five cyprinids (Carassius cuvieri, Gnathopogon caerulescens, Ischikauia steenackeri, Opsariichthys uncirostris and Sarcocheilichthys biwaensis), a true loach (Cobitis magnostriata), two gobies (Gymnogobius isaza and an undescribed species of Rhinogobius), two silurid catfish (Silurus biwaensis and S. lithophilus) and a cottid (Cottus reinii). The Biwa trout is also endemic to the lake, but some maintain {{that it is}} a subspecies of the widespread <b>masu</b> <b>salmon</b> rather than a separate species. The remaining endemic fish are subspecies of Carassius auratus, Cobitis minamorii, Sarcocheilichthys variegatus and Squalidus (chankaensis) biwae.|$|E
50|$|The {{forest is}} a mix of {{broadleaf}} and conifer, with the forest type becoming more conifer dominated at higher elevations and more broad-leaf-conifer mixed at the lower elevations and within valleys. The most common species include the Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) and needle fir (Abies holophylla) at the lowest elevations and coastlines. Jezo spruce (Picea jezoensis) and Manchurian fir (Abies nephrolepis) are common species to be found from 700-1400 meters. Other tree species include Mongolian oak (Quercus mongolica), white birch (Betula platyphylla), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), trembling aspen (Populus tremula), Dahurian birch (Betula davurica), and Gmelin larch (Larix gemlinii), a deciduous evergreen tree common throughout, but dominant in the northern reaches of the forestThe Amur region of Russia holds the last remaining habitats of the critically endangered Amur tiger, Amur leopard, and Manchurian sika deer. It has been estimated that there are less the 600 tigers. and around 40 leopards left in the wild. The area also contains populations of Asiatic black bears and Kamchatka brown bears, as the Russian Far East is {{the only place in the}} world where tigers, brown bears, and leopards coexist. This region also happens to be some of the last of habitat of the Blakiston’s fish owl (bubo blakistoni); along with being the world’s largest owl, it is unique in the way that it eats fish (primarily <b>Masu</b> <b>salmon)</b> and relies on old growth forests along river banks to feed, nest, and breed. Common ungulates include red deer, roe deer, wild boar, Manchurian moose, and musk deer.|$|E
40|$|The {{spawning}} ground of chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) is usually located farther downriver {{than that of}} <b>masu</b> <b>salmon</b> (Oncorhynchus masou) in Hokkaido, Japan. To compare the swimming abilities of these two species, the relationship between swimming speed and oxygen consumption was compared using a swim tunnel in the laboratory. Then, the upstream-migration behaviors of chum salmon and <b>masu</b> <b>salmon</b> were compared using electromyogram telemetry at fish passages in the Toyohira River, Hokkaido. In the laboratory study, the standard metabolic rate of <b>masu</b> <b>salmon</b> was lower and the critical swimming speed (U-crit) was faster than those of chum salmon. In the field study, the holding time needed to recover the swimming performance exceeding U-crit at the fish passages and the trial number needed to pass the fish passages were significantly lower for <b>masu</b> <b>salmon</b> than chum salmon. These results revealed that <b>masu</b> <b>salmon</b> are more adaptable to extended swimming in high water velocity conditions than chum salmon and that <b>masu</b> <b>salmon</b> are better equipped for a long distance upstream migration to their {{spawning ground}} than chum salmon...|$|E
40|$|Trypsin {{from the}} pyloric ceca of <b>masu</b> <b>salmon</b> (Oncorhynchus masou) cultured in fresh-water was {{purified}} {{by a series}} of chromatographies including Sephacryl S- 200, Sephadex G- 50 and diethylaminoethyl-cellulose to obtain a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and native-PAGE. The molecular mass of the purified trypsin was estimated to be approximately 24, 000 Da by SDS-PAGE. The enzyme activity was strongly inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and Nα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone. <b>Masu</b> <b>salmon</b> trypsin was stabilized by calcium ion. The optimum pH of the <b>masu</b> <b>salmon</b> trypsin was around pH 8. 5 and the trypsin was unstable below pH 5. 0. The optimum temperature of the <b>masu</b> <b>salmon</b> trypsin was around 60 ℃, and the trypsin was stable below 50 ℃, like temperate-zone and tropical-zone fish trypsins. The N-terminal 20 amino acid sequence of the <b>masu</b> <b>salmon</b> trypsin was IVGGYECKAYSQPHQVSLNS, and its charged amino acid content was lower than those of trypsins from frigid-zone fish and similar to those of trypsins from temperate-zone and tropical-zone fish.

40|$|We have cloned and {{determined}} the nucleotide sequences of cDNAs encoding precursors of neurohypophysial hormones, vasotocin (VT) and isotocin (IT), from the hypothalamus of <b>masu</b> <b>salmon,</b> Oncorhynchus masou. The deduced amino acid sequences of <b>masu</b> <b>salmon</b> VT and IT precursors (proVT-I and proIT-I) are highly homologous {{to those of}} chum salmon proVT-I and proIT-I, respectively. The VT and IT precursors are composed of a signal peptide, hormone and neurophysin (NP), the middle portion of which is highly conserved among vertebrates. Both the NPs extend about 30 amino acids at the C-terminal. The extended C-terminals have a leucin-rich segment in the carboxyl-terminal, as copeptin of vasopressin precursor. Southern bot analysis showed the presence of two types of proVT genes (proVT-I and proVT-II) and proIT genes (proIT-I and proIT-II) in an individual <b>masu</b> <b>salmon,</b> as in a chum salmon. Southern blot analysis with proVT probes further suggested {{that at least two}} different types of proVT-I genes exist in a single <b>masu</b> <b>salmon.</b> Norhtern blot analysis indicated that proVT-I and proIT-I genes are expressed in the hypothalamus, whereas proVT-II and proIT-II genes are not expressed. Evolutionary distance between proVT-I and proIT-I genes was statistically estimated based on synonymous nucleotide substitution in the coding region of the cDNAs. The magnitude of distance between <b>masu</b> <b>salmon</b> proVT-I and proIT-I genes suggested that the highly conserved central portion of NPs resulted from a gene conversion event. Between <b>masu</b> <b>salmon</b> and chum salmon, evolutionary distance for proVT-I genes is about 6 -fold larger than that for proIT-I genes...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} of vertical transmission of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) was studied using the eggs of <b>masu</b> <b>salmon</b> Oncorhynchus masou and chum salmon O. keta. One day after incubation, IHNV was not detected from the eggs of <b>masu</b> <b>salmon</b> and chum salmon contaminated with IHNV. Eggs just after fertilization, and eyed eggs were injected intraoviumly with IHNV by microglass needle. Infectivity of IHNV inside the eggs decreased gradually {{and could not}} be detected 1 week or 5 weeks after incubation. This reduction rate of IHNV infectivity in the fertilized egg was similar to that found in the mixture with IHNV and the homogenized egg contents. Several kinds of phospholipid, amino acid and vitamin those were components of yolk showed anti-IHNV activity. In the eyed eggs, the embryos of both <b>masu</b> <b>salmon</b> and chum salmon were infected with IHNV, and this infectivity increased rapidly and reached more than 10 ^ 6. 5 TCID 50 /fish. The cumulative mortality of both <b>masu</b> <b>salmon</b> and chum salmon were 90 %. The rate of susceptibility of hatched-out <b>masu</b> <b>salmon</b> and chum salmon fry against IHNV were different, and the cumulative mortality was more than 90 % in <b>masu</b> <b>salmon</b> and 20 to 30 % in chum salmon artificially infected with IHNV by immersion method. From above results, we concluded that the vertical transmission of IHNV is doubtful. サクラマスとシロサケの未受精卵および受精卵を供試し，人為的にIHNVで汚染した後の死卵率およびウイルス感染価の消長を観察するとともに，卵内成分のIHNV感染価に及ぼす影響についても検討し以下の結論を得た。 1) 両魚種ともに，受精時に卵あるいは精子が汚染されても死卵は見られず，ウイルスも検出されなかった。 2) 受精直後の卵内にIHNVを接種した場合，サクラマスで 3 週間以内，シロサケで 5 週間以内に全卵死亡したが，ウイルスはサクラマスで 1 週間後，シロサケで 5 週間後に検出限界以下となった。 3) シロサケの未受精卵内容物にIHNVを懸濁した場合，ウイルス感染価の漸減傾向が観察され，セファリン，グルタミン酸，フェニルアラニン，トリプトファン，ピリドキサルリン酸および葉酸にウイルス不活化効果が観察された。 4) 発眼卵内にIHNVを接種した場合，サクラマスでは 7 日以内に全個体，シロサケでは 15 日以内に 90 %が死亡し，両魚種とも一尾当り 10 ^ 6. 50 TCID 50 /g以上のウイルス感染価が得られた...|$|E
