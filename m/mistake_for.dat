5|$|Dragonflies are {{attracted}} to shiny surfaces that produce polarization which they can <b>mistake</b> <b>for</b> water, {{and they have been}} known to aggregate close to polished gravestones, solar panels, automobiles, and other such structures on which they attempt to lay eggs. These can have a local impact on dragonfly populations; methods of reducing the attractiveness of structures such as solar panels are under experimentation.|$|E
5|$|The Church of St Cuthbert (which {{tourists}} often <b>mistake</b> <b>for</b> the cathedral) has a fine Somerset stone {{tower and}} a superb carved roof. Originally an Early English building (13th century), {{it was much}} altered in the Perpendicular period (15th century). The nave's coloured ceiling was repainted in 1963 at the instigation of the then Vicar's wife, Mrs Barnett. Until 1561 the church had a central tower which either collapsed or was removed, and has been replaced with the current tower over the west door. Bells were cast for the tower by Roger Purdy.|$|E
5|$|Polymorphous light {{eruption}} (PMLE) is {{the easiest}} disease to <b>mistake</b> <b>for</b> solar urticaria because {{the locations of the}} lesions are similar (the V of the neck and the arms). However, patients with SU are more likely to develop lesions on the face. Also, a reaction with PMLE will take a greater amount of time to appear than with solar urticaria. Lupus erythematosus has been mistaken for SU; however, lesions from lupus erythematosus will take a longer amount of time to go away. Furthermore, when being tested for the two diseases, patients with SU have a reaction immediately while patients with lupus erythematosus will have a delayed reaction. Patients who have experienced solar urticarial symptoms from a young age could mistakenly be thought to have erythropoietic protoporphyria. However, the main symptom for this disease is pain and patients with have been found to have abnormal levels of protoporphyrin in their blood while these levels are normal in SU patients. Finally, cholinergic urticaria, or urticaria induced by heat, can occasionally appear to be solar urticaria because the heat from the sun will cause a person with the disease to have a reaction.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year, Ua Conchobair {{convened a}} great assembly at Athboy. The Annals of the Four Masters states that 13,000 horsemen attended the meeting—1,000 {{of which were}} supplied from Dublin. One of the many rulers recorded to have attended this gathering is a certain Ragnall mac Ragnaill, styled tigerna Gall ("lord of the foreigners"). The latter's name and title suggest that he was either an otherwise unattested brother of Ascall, or else an annalist's <b>mistake</b> <b>for</b> Ascall himself. Meanwhile, after his expulsion from Ireland, Mac Murchada sought out Henry on the Continent, and gained permission to recruit military aid from the latter's subjects. In the autumn of 1167, Mac Murchada and his English allies arrived in Ireland, where they established themselves at Ferns. Ua Conchobair responded by penetrating Uí Chennselaig in a campaign, recounted by the fourteenth-century Annals of Tigernach, that included military support from Dublin. With Mac Murchada temporally kept in check, a preoccupied Ua Conchobair allowed him to hold onto {{at least part of}} his patrimony.|$|E

They had enormous difficulties in manufacturing the necessary chips reliably and in quantity, in programming workable and efficient programs, in coordinating entirely separate operations, and in providing support to computer users.|$|E
25|$|Next Magazine {{published}} on 3 April {{reported that the}} {{managing director of the}} HIT Gerry Yim Lui-fai, who earlier said that the workers should negotiate with the contractors but not HIT refused to involve in the dispute, was a board member of one of the contractors involved in the pay dispute. HIT denied this; Yim reiterated that no members of top management of Hutchison Whampoa, Hutchison Port Holdings Trust or HIT are board members of any of the contractors. Yim said that the name of Sakoma – the HIT subsidiary that previously dealt with out-sourcing contracts – still appears on the entry passcards, and acknowledged it was a <b>mistake</b> <b>for</b> that name to be there. Yim said the Hutchison Logistics, replacing Sakoma, is now responsible for management of out-sourcing.|$|E
25|$|In the {{afternoon}} Ribault crossed over with eight gentlemen and was entertained by Menéndez. The French accepted some wine and preserves; {{but would not}} take more, knowing the fate of their companions. Then Ribault, pointing to the bodies of his comrades, which were visible from where he stood, said {{that they might have}} been tricked into the belief that Fort Caroline was taken, referring to a story he had heard from a barber who had survived the first massacre by feigning death when he was struck down, and had then escaped. But Ribault was soon convinced of his <b>mistake,</b> <b>for</b> he was allowed to converse privately with two Frenchmen captured at Fort Caroline. Then he turned to Menéndez and asked again for ships with which to return to France. The Spaniard was unyielding, and Ribault returned to his companions to acquaint them with the results of the interview.|$|E

25|$|When people develop visceral leishmaniasis, {{the most}} typical {{symptoms}} are fever and the {{enlargement of the}} spleen, with enlargement of the liver sometimes being seen as well. The blackening of the skin that gave the disease its common name in India {{does not appear in}} most strains of the disease, and the other symptoms are very easy to <b>mistake</b> <b>for</b> those of malaria. Misdiagnosis is dangerous, as without proper treatment the mortality rate for kala-azar is close to 100%. L. donovani itself is not usually the direct cause of death in kala-azar sufferers, however. Pneumonia, tuberculosis, and dysentery are omnipresent in the depressed regions where leishmaniasis thrives, and, as with AIDS, it is these opportunistic infections that are more likely to kill, flaring up in a host whose immune system has been weakened by the L. donovani infection. Progress of the disease is extremely variable, taking anywhere from one to twenty weeks, but a typical duration for the Sudanese strain of the disease is narrower, between twelve and sixteen weeks.|$|E
25|$|Voltaire's famous {{quotations}} about New France {{were for}} the most part written between 1753 and 1763, shortly before, and then during, the Seven Years' War. Voltaire was living in Switzerland during most of this period. During the war, he sometimes appeared to favor the Prussian king Frederick II (allied to Britain against France), with whom he was maintaining a regular personal correspondence during the war (the two men being again in better terms after their quarrel of 1753). Voltaire was also {{at the same time in}} correspondence with some French ministers. He thus corresponded with both sides of the belligerents in the war, although mostly on a personal and literary level more than a political level. He thought that the war was a <b>mistake</b> <b>for</b> France and he used several opportunities to ask the French ministers to simply quit the war. Boundary disputes in their American colonies had been an early casus belli (1754) between Britain and France in this war, which was later (1756) further complicated by purely European considerations and ended seven years later (1763). Voltaire's position that France should let go of its North American colonies was in accord with his position about the war in general. For him, handing over New France would appease Britain. His position about the European war likely increased his tendency to paint New France as being of little value.|$|E

After this false ending, the song returns with a 45-second coda, which MacDonald identifies as a [...] "Maori finale – a <b>mistake</b> <b>for</b> 'Hawaiian' (aloha)".

The weapon, a black hedgehog and self-proclaimed [...] "Ultimate Life Form", Shadow, offers to help Eggman conquer the world, telling him to rendezvous at an abandoned space colony, ARK, with more Chaos Emeralds. Shadow goes to Central City, encountering G.U.N.'s forces after stealing an Emerald. Shadow has vowed to fulfill a promise to a girl, Maria, which he interprets as one of revenge.

500|$|Despite their {{defeat in}} this battle, the Allies {{eventually}} {{won the battle}} for Guadalcanal, {{an important step in}} the eventual defeat of Japan. In hindsight, if Mikawa had elected to risk his ships to go after the Allied transports on the morning of August 9, he could have improved the chances of Japanese victory in the Guadalcanal campaign at its inception, and {{the course of the war}} in the southern Pacific could have gone much differently. Although the Allied warships at Guadalcanal that night were completely routed, the transports were unaffected. Many of these same transports were used many times to bring crucial supplies and reinforcements to Allied forces on Guadalcanal over succeeding months. [...] Mikawa's decision not to destroy the Allied transport ships when he had the opportunity would prove to be a crucial strategic <b>mistake</b> <b>for</b> the Japanese.|$|E
