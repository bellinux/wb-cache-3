25|$|Any object {{containing}} pointed {{metal can}} create an electric arc (sparks) when microwaved. This includes cutlery, crumpled aluminium foil (though some foil used in <b>microwaves</b> are <b>safe,</b> see below), twist-ties containing metal wire, the metal wire carry-handles in paper Chinese take-out food containers, or almost any metal formed into a poorly conductive foil or thin wire; or into a pointed shape. Forks {{are a good}} example: the tines of the fork respond to the electric field by producing high concentrations of electric charge at the tips. This {{has the effect of}} exceeding the dielectric breakdown of air, about 3 megavolts per meter (3×106 V/m). The air forms a conductive plasma, which is visible as a spark. The plasma and the tines may then form a conductive loop, which may be a more effective antenna, resulting in a longer lived spark. When dielectric breakdown occurs in air, some ozone and nitrogen oxides are formed, both of which are unhealthy in large quantities.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{microwave}} {{method has}} been applied to the hydrothermal extraction of essential oil from plants. An insulated microwave coaxial antenna was introduced inside a 1000 ml glass flask containing dry Laurus nobilis L. leaves and tap water. Microwave power up to 800 Wat 2450 MHz was emitted in continuous wave regime (CW) or in pulsed regime (PR) at 8 kW peak power. Stirring with a magnetic bar and a Clevenger refrigerator connected to the flask enabled to complete the extraction in 1 h. The results of the in situ microwave extraction were compared with those obtained by heating the same reactor with a conventional electric mantle by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis. Differences were observed both in the composition of the essential oil and from the energetic point of view. The essential oil obtained with microwave (MW) methods contained substantially higher amounts of oxygenated compounds and lower amounts of monoterpenes than conventional method. The in situ <b>microwave</b> heating is <b>safe</b> and versatile; it presents time and energy saving advantages, and therefore it can be considered useful also for industrial application...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Solvent- free {{microwave}} extraction is a {{newly developed}} technique for the solid-liquid extraction with microwave as the energy source. Solvent- free microwave extraction method {{was reported to}} be an efficient extraction method in terms of selectivity, yield and speed. The development in microwave techniques has occurred because of a need for a rapid, safe and cheap method. Solvent-free microwave extraction (SFME) is a combination of microwave heating and dry distillation, performed at atmospheric pressure without added any solvent or water. Isolation and concentration of volatile compounds are performed by a single stage. The essential oils extracted by SFME for 60 min were quantitatively (yield) and qualitatively (aromatic profile) similar to those obtained by conventional hydro-distillation for 4. 5 h. Essential oils provided by SFME are dominated by the oxygenated fraction which is the more valuable and composed of highly odoriferous aromatic compounds and allows substantial savings of costs, in terms of time, energy and plant material. The in situ <b>microwave</b> heating is <b>safe</b> and versatile; it presents time and energy saving advantages, and therefore it can b...|$|R
40|$|Liver {{transplant}} is {{the preferred}} treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis, as both neoplastic and cirrhotic liver tissue can be removed. Treatment of recurring neoplasms is a difficult issue, especially in long-term survivors of liver transplant. No consensus has been reached on the treatment of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma. Although patients with extrahepatic metastases are generally not candidates for local therapy, successful multimodal salvage therapy including resection or ablation can be achieved in liver transplant recipients with local recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma. <b>Microwave</b> ablation is <b>safe</b> and effective for treating unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, achieving excellent results in local disease down-staging or as a "bridge" to liver transplant, with {{no significant differences in}} local recurrence and complications compared with the more commonly used radiofrequency ablation. A patient with local recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma 36 months after liver transplant for multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis due to hepatitis C was successfully treated with laparoscopic microwave ablation without any postoperative complications. The patient is disease free 24 months after microwave ablation...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen an {{increased}} interest in ultra wideband (UWB) microwave imaging systems as an important alternative for mammography and other techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging or ultra sound in breast cancer detection. The reason is that <b>microwaves</b> offer a <b>safe</b> and low cost option for patients screening in comparison with these alternatives [1, 2]. The feasibility of UWB microwave imaging relies on two fundamental properties: Firstly, tumours have higher water content and hence a higher dielectric constant compared with the normal breast tissues, which is mainly fat. Therefore, a strong scattering {{takes place at the}} boundary between the normal tissue and lesions. Secondly, microwave attenuation in normal breast tissue is less than 4. 5 dB/cm across an UW frequency band of 3. 1 to 10. 6 GHz. This value of attenuation permits the microwave imaging system to detect small size, early-stage tumours. In order to enhance the detection process for a given dynamic range of the breast radar, recent approaches to UWB microwave imaging tend to employ a coupling medium between an imaged object (the breast) and an illuminating device (an antenna). In this case, both the antenna and the breast are immersed in a coupling medium. The reflected/scattered signal is collected and analysed to get a three dimensional image of the object depending on its dielectric profile. The use of a coupling medium minimizes the reflection at the skin interface, thereby reducing the propagation loss, and thus increases the dynamic range and resolution of the imaging system. The reviewing of the literature related to this important topic shows that the researchers use a coupling medium with a dielectric constant which is either equal to that of the skin or the normal tissue [3 - 5]. Neither of these two choices addresses the question of the optimal characteristics of the coupling medium. In this paper, a theoretical analysis, supported by computer simulations, is conducted to work out the - - optimal characteristics of the coupling medium...|$|R
