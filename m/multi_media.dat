At this time, music video clips {{did not exist in}} large {{quantity}} and the video installation was used to present an occasional film.

Working alongside the DJ, this collection of raw visuals was mixed in real time to create a non-stop visual interpretation of the music. Merrill became the world's first full-time VJ. MTV founders came to this club and Merrill introduced them to the term and the role of [...] "VJ",inspiring them to have VJ hosts on their channel the following year. Merrill collaborated with many musicians at the club, notably with electronic musician Richard Bone to make the first ambient music video album titled [...] "Emerging Video". Thanks to a grant from the Experimental Television Center, her blend of video and 16mm film bore the influential mark of the unique Rutt Etra and Paik synthesizers. This film was offered on VHS through [...] "High Times Magazine" [...] and was featured in the club programming. Her next foray into the home video audience was in collaboration with the newly formed arm of Sony, Sony HOME VIDEO, where she introduced the concept of [...] "breaking music on video" [...] with her series DANSPAK. With a few exceptions like the Jim Carrol Band with Lou Reed and Man Parrish, this series featured unknown bands, many of them unsigned.|$|E
