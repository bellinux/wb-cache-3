This defect simultaneously leads to the accumulation of linear malto-oligosaccharides.

Leveduras do gênero Saccharomyces são utilizadas em diversos processos industriais, dentre eles a fermentação da sacarose para a produção de etanol combustível. A utilização da sacarose ocorre pela sua hidrólise extracelular mediada pela enzima {{invertase}} codificada pelo gene SUC 2. A hidrólise libera glicose e frutose no meio que são internalizadas pelos transportadores de hexoses codificados pelos genes HXT. Entretanto, a presença do transportador de membrana codificado pelo gene AGT 1 possibilita o transporte direto da sacarose para o interior da célula onde a mesma é hidrolisada pela invertase intracelular, ou pelas <b>maltases.</b> Apesar das linhagens industriais CAT- 1 e PE- 2 possuírem o gene AGT 1 no seu genoma, este gene parece ser não-funcional nessas linhagens. O objetivo deste trabalho foi sobre-expressar o gene AGT 1 das linhagens CAT- 1 e PE- 2 para avaliar a sua funcionalidade. Para tal, os genes amplificados por PCR foram inseridos no vetor de sobre-expressão pGRSd. Os novos vetores foram utilizados para transformar a levedura LCM 003, que não possui o gene AGT 1 no seu genoma. Foi observado que as diferenças na composição de nucleotídeos do gene AGT 1 das linhagens CAT- 1 e PE- 2, em relação à linhagem de laboratório S 288 C, não interfere na atividade do mesmo quando esse está sobre o controle de um promotor forte. Após sequenciar a região promotora do gene AGT 1 nas linhagens industriais produtoras de etanol, podemos concluir que a falta de atividade deste gene está relacionada com uma região promotora defeituosa, recentemente descrita também em outras S. cerevisiae utilizadas em processos industriais. Yeasts of {{the genus}} Saccharomyces are used in various industrial processes, including fermentation of sucrose {{for the production of}} fuel ethanol. The use of sucrose is mediated by this extracellular hydrolysis by the enzyme invertase encoded by SUC 2 gene. The hydrolysis release glucose and fructose in the medium that are internalized by hexose transporters encoded by the HXT genes. However, the presence of membrane transporter encoded by the AGT 1 gene enables direct transport of sucrose into the cell where it is hydrolyzed by intracellular invertase, or the <b>maltases.</b> Despite industrial strains CAT- 1 and PE- 2 having the AGT 1 gene in their genome, this gene appears to be nonfunctional in these strains. This work was over-express the gene AGT 1 strains CAT- 1 and PE- 2 to evaluate its functionality. To this end, the genes amplified by PCR were inserted into the vector overexpression pGRSd. The new vectors were used to transform the yeast LCM 003, which lacks the AGT 1 gene in their genome. It has been observed that differences in the nucleotide composition of the AGT 1 gene of the strains CAT- 1 and PE- 2 compared to laboratory strain S 288 C does not interfere with activity even when it is under the control of a strong promoter. After sequencing the AGT 1 gene promoter in industrial ethanol-producing strains, we conclude that the lack of activity of this gene is linked to a defective promoter region recently described also in other S. cerevisiae used in industrial processes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Overflow {{metabolism}} is an undesirable {{characteristic of}} aerobic cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae during biomass-directed processes. It results from elevated sugar consumption rates that cause a high substrate conversion to ethanol and other bi-products, severely affecting cell physiology, bioprocess performance, and biomass yields. Fed-batch culture, where sucrose consumption rates {{are controlled by}} the external addition of sugar aiming at its low concentrations in the fermentor, is the classical bioprocessing alternative to prevent sugar fermentation by yeasts. However, fed-batch fermentations present drawbacks that could be overcome by simpler batch cultures at relatively high (e. g. 20 g/L) initial sugar concentrations. In this study, a S. cerevisiae strain lacking invertase activity was engineered to transport sucrose into the cells through a low-affinity and low-capacity sucrose-H + symport activity, and the growth kinetics and biomass yields on sucrose analyzed using simple batch cultures. Results We have deleted from the genome of a S. cerevisiae strain lacking invertase the high-affinity sucrose-H + symporter encoded by the AGT 1 gene. This strain could still grow efficiently on sucrose due to a low-affinity and low-capacity sucrose-H + symport activity mediated by the MALx 1 maltose permeases, and its further intracellular hydrolysis by cytoplasmic <b>maltases.</b> Although sucrose consumption by this engineered yeast strain was slower than with the parental yeast strain, the cells grew efficiently on sucrose due to an increased respiration of the carbon source. Consequently, this engineered yeast strain produced less ethanol and 1. 5 to 2 times more biomass when cultivated in simple batch mode using 20 g/L sucrose as the carbon source. Conclusion Higher cell densities during batch cultures on 20 g/L sucrose were achieved by using a S. cerevisiae strain engineered in the sucrose uptake system. Such result was accomplished by effectively reducing sucrose uptake by the yeast cells, avoiding overflow metabolism, with the concomitant reduction in ethanol production. The use of this modified yeast strain in simpler batch culture mode can be a viable option to more complicated traditional sucrose-limited fed-batch cultures for biomass-directed processes of S. cerevisiae. </p...|$|R

50|$|One {{important}} aminopeptidase is a zinc-dependent enzyme {{produced and}} secreted by glands {{of the small}} intestine. It helps the enzymatic digestion of proteins.

[...] This can help in the treatment of diarrhea, as the level of enzymatic activity has diminished and carbohydrate cannot be degraded and absorbed.|$|E
50|$|Due to O-glycosidic link, maltose is a {{disaccharide}} {{that can}} reduce Fehling's reagent.Furthermore, maltose {{can be obtained}} by hydrolysis of glycogen or starch, polymers of linked maltoses in position α(1 → 4) and branching in position α(1 → 6). These are very abundant and form a large number of branches. Amylase enzymes produce maltose and limit dextrin. These can be further degraded by <b>maltase</b> enzyme to hydrolyze maltoses as glucoses and they are ready to be degrade and obtain energy in form of ATP.|$|E
50|$|The joining {{of simple}} sugars into a double sugar happens by a {{condensation}} reaction, which involves {{the elimination of}} a water molecule from the functional groups only. Breaking apart a double sugar into its two simple sugars is accomplished by hydrolysis {{with the help of}} a type of enzyme called a disaccharidase. As building the larger sugar ejects a water molecule, breaking it down consumes a water molecule. These reactions are vital in metabolism. Each disaccharide is broken down {{with the help of a}} corresponding disaccharidase (sucrase, lactase, and <b>maltase).</b>|$|E
50|$|Digestion of starch {{begins with}} the action of salivary alpha-amylase/ptyalin, {{although}} its activity is slight in comparison with that of pancreatic amylase in the small intestine. Amylase hydrolyzes starch to alpha-dextrin, which are then digested by gluco-amylase (alpha-dextrinases) to maltose and maltotriose. The products of digestion of alpha-amylase and alpha-dextrinase, along with dietary disaccharides are hydrolyzed to their corresponding monosaccharides by enzymes (<b>maltase,</b> isomaltase, sucrase and lactase) present in the brush border of the small intestine. In the typical Western diet, digestion and absorption of carbohydrates is fast and takes place usually in the upper small intestine. However, when the diet contains carbohydrates not easily digestible, digestion and absorption take place mainly in the ileal portion of the intestine.|$|E
50|$|Changes in the {{nutrient}} {{composition of the}} diet (the proportion of lipids, proteins and carbohydrates) may occur during development (e.g. weaning) or with seasonal changes in the abundance of different food types. These diet changes can elicit plasticity in the activity of particular digestive enzymes on the brush border of the small intestine. For example, {{in the first few}} days after hatching, nestling house sparrows (Passer domesticus) transition from an insect diet, high in protein and lipids, to a seed based diet that contains mostly carbohydrates; this diet change is accompanied by two-fold increase in the activity of the enzyme <b>maltase,</b> which digests carbohydrates. Acclimatizing animals to high protein diets can increase the activity of aminopeptidase-N, which digests proteins.|$|E
50|$|Lactobacillus pontis {{is used in}} {{the starter}} for making sourdough bread. The starter {{consists}} of water, flour, yeast, and the starter culture of bacteria. The bacteria begin fermentation by breaking down the sugars, forming lactic acid in the process. This process lowers the pH of the solution, producing a “sour” taste in the final product. Lactobacillus pontis breaks down sugars that cannot be metabolized by the yeast in the culture, just as many Lactobacillus species do. When wheat flour and water are in solution together, the amylase enzymes present breakdown the starch into maltose, and <b>maltase</b> performs a further breakdown into glucose. The lactic acid producing bacteria are responsible for breaking down sugars and the yeast uses by-products from this process to form carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide causes leavening in the dough.|$|E
50|$|Fermentation {{typically}} {{begins when}} viable baker's yeast or a starter culture {{is added to}} flour and water. Enzymes in the flour and yeast create sugars, which are consumed by the yeast, who in turn produce carbon dioxide and alcohol. Specifically, the grain enzyme diastase begins to convert starch in the grain to maltose. The baker's yeast enzyme <b>maltase</b> converts maltose into glucose, invertase converts any added sucrose to glucose and fructose, and zymase converts glucose and fructose to carbon dioxide gas which makes the dough rise, and alcohol which gives the baked bread flavor. Sourdough starters also produce lactic and acetic acids, further contributing to flavor. When the yeast cells die, they release high quantities of a protease which snip protein strands, and in large dieoffs result in soft, sticky dough, less baked volume and a coarse crumb, but in smaller dieoffs, increase dough extensibility and baked volume.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{carbohydrates}} are degraded into simple sugars, or monosaccharides (e.g., glucose). Pancreatic amylase {{breaks down}} some carbohydrates (notably starch) into oligosaccharides. Other carbohydrates pass undigested {{into the large}} intestine and further handling by intestinal bacteria. Brush border enzymes take over from there. The most important brush border enzymes are dextrinase and glucoamylase, which further break down oligosaccharides. Other brush border enzymes are <b>maltase,</b> sucrase and lactase. Lactase is absent in some adult humans and, for them, lactose, like most poly-saccharides, is not digested in the small intestine. Some carbohydrates, such as cellulose, are not digested at all, despite being made of multiple glucose units. This is because the cellulose {{is made out of}} beta-glucose, making the inter-monosaccharidal bindings different from the ones present in starch, which consists of alpha-glucose. Humans lack the enzyme for splitting the beta-glucose-bonds, something reserved for herbivores and bacteria from the large intestine.|$|E
50|$|Homopolysaccharides of glucose {{are broken}} down by <b>maltase</b> and isomaltase to produce glucose. The lack of the Sucrase-Isomaltase enzyme, {{one of the four}} {{integral}} glycoproteins, causes sucrose and maltose intolerance and is called Congenital Sucrase-Isomaltase Deficiency. This congenital disorder is most prominent in infancy but can develop later in life. It is caused by a recessive autosomal mutation (mostly SI and SII). Nonetheless, {{depending on the type of}} mutation there are certain degrees of intolerance. According to this degree, physicians may decide the amount of starch the patient may have to remain healthy.This intolerance begins when infants begin to eat nutrients that contain starch, mainly containing maltose. One can notice that a patient suffers from this pathology when they have “stomach cramps, bloating, excess gas production, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Upper respiratory tract and viral infections are common. These digestive problems can lead to lower than normal weight gain and growth. Possible associations are kidney stones and copper malabsorption.”Further studies have shown that certain patients with different degrees of mutation can actually improve throughout the years, reaching a maximum improvement at ages 3 years and 6 months.|$|E
5000|$|Traditional San Francisco sourdough is a Type I sourdough. Type I sourdoughs are {{generally}} firm doughs, have a pH range of 3.8 to 4.5, and are fermented in a temperature range of 20 to 30 C. Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis {{was named for}} its discovery in San Francisco sourdough starters, {{though it is not}} endemic to San Francisco. Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and L. pontis often highlight a lactic-acid bacterial flora that includes L. fermentum, L. fructivorans, L. brevis, and L. paralimentarius. The yeasts Saccharomyces exiguus, Candida milleri, or Candida holmii usually populate sourdough cultures symbiotically with Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis. [...] The perfect yeast S. exiguus is related to the imperfect yeasts C. milleri and C. holmii. Torulopsis holmii, Torula holmii, and S. rosei are synonyms used prior to 1978. C. milleri and C. holmii are physiologically similar, but DNA testing established them as distinct. Other yeasts reported found include C. humilis, C. krusei, Pichia anomaola, C. peliculosa, P. membranifaciens, and C. valida. There have been changes in the taxonomy of yeasts in recent decades. [...] L. sanfranciscensis requires maltose, while C. milleri is <b>maltase</b> negative and thus cannot consume maltose. C. milleri can grow under conditions of low pH and relatively high acetate levels, a factor contributing to sourdough flora's stability.|$|E
