5|$|The shaded north {{slopes of}} cinder cones provide <b>more</b> <b>protection</b> from direct {{sunlight}} and prevailing southwesterly winds {{and have a}} more persistent snow cover (an important water source in early spring).

5|$|The {{bill was}} next {{considered}} in the Senate, where it faced stronger opposition from key Democrats led by Arthur Pue Gorman of Maryland, who insisted on <b>more</b> <b>protection</b> for their states' industries than the Wilson bill allowed. The bill passed the Senate with more than 600 amendments attached that nullified most of the reforms. The Sugar Trust in particular lobbied for changes that favored it {{at the expense of}} the consumer. Cleveland was outraged with the final bill, and denounced it as a disgraceful product of the control of the Senate by trusts and business interests. Even so, he believed it was an improvement over the McKinley tariff and allowed it to become law without his signature.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area in 1984 stopped any further geothermal prospecting. Mono Basin {{was the first}} National Scenic Area in the United States. It offers <b>more</b> <b>protection</b> than other United States Forest Service lands, surrounds Mono Lake and its two volcanic islands, Black Point, Panum Crater {{and much of the}} northern half of the Mono Craters. Litigation and outreach by the Mono Lake Committee, the National Audubon Society and other conservation groups has helped to slow water diversions from tributaries feeding Mono Lake.|$|E

5|$|Although 1 ATF {{was well}} placed {{to deny the}} communists the use of its AO, it was {{increasingly}} obvious {{that there was little}} role for the SAS. Indeed, the heavy presence of Viet Cong prevented them from operating normally, and the first attempt to insert a patrol was called off due to the presence of hostile forces {{in the vicinity of the}} landing zone; two Viet Cong were subsequently killed and the patrol was extracted after only 30 minutes. A second attempt lasted only fifteen minutes longer, and they were also extracted following a brief contact. Finally, two patrols were joined together in an effort to provide <b>more</b> <b>protection,</b> and on 29 January they patrolled out from 7 RAR battalion headquarters. After only 30 minutes the Australians encountered a small party of Viet Cong; however, they tried again two hours later but were detected. The following day they tried for a third time and were contacted. Unable to operate effectively, the SAS patrols were withdrawn and returned to Nui Dat on 1 February.|$|E

25|$|Article VI of the Code Noir forbade mixed marriages, forbade but {{did little}} to protect slave women from rape by their owners, overseers or other slaves.

50|$|A {{state law}} that had protections for {{transgender}} people failed to pass shortly before the attack. Gov.

In addition, Howard County passed a county law protecting transgender people within its boundaries.|$|R
25|$|In Pennsylvania, the House of Representatives {{created a}} special {{legislative}} committee to investigate issues of academic freedom, including whether students who hold unpopular views need <b>more</b> <b>protection.</b> In November 2006 it {{reported that it}} had not found evidence of problems with students' rights.|$|E

25|$|Buffer strips {{can have}} several {{different}} configurations of vegetation found on them varying from simply grass to combinations of grass, trees, and shrubs.

25|$|Ordinary, {{untreated}} eyeglasses {{give some}} protection. Most plastic lenses give <b>more</b> <b>protection</b> than glass lenses, because, as noted above, glass is transparent to UVA {{and the common}} acrylic plastic used for lenses is less so.

25|$|In practice, these MPAs {{are defined}} areas where natural and/or {{cultural}} resources are given <b>more</b> <b>protection</b> than {{occurs in the}} surrounding waters.

They vary in purpose, legal authorities, agencies, management approaches, level of protection, and restrictions on human uses.|$|E
5000|$|The punter is {{the player}} {{closer to the}} net, that's why he's who'll play less balls (because they are so fast they won't be able to hit them properly) and who needs less {{strength}} in order to throw it back, but also, he'll receive the stronger balls, hence he'll use <b>more</b> <b>protections</b> on the hands.|$|R
5000|$|Residential leases are {{contracts}} {{that are designed}} for individuals or groups to live, or reside, in the leased space. Most governmental entities have [...] "recognized {{the sanctity of the}} home." [...] Therefore, lessees of residential spaces are generally afforded <b>more</b> rights and <b>protections</b> than commercial leases. It is also because of the presumption of unequal bargaining power that residential spaces are afforded <b>more</b> <b>protections.</b> States, counties, and cities have different laws, and likewise, varying levels of protections for the tenants and landlords of commercial spaces.|$|R

25|$|In November 1989 the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals {{ruled that}} team owners were {{exempt from the}} federal {{antitrust}} laws so long as players were adequately represented by a union. That same year, the NFLPA decertified as a union, stating its union status provided <b>more</b> <b>protection</b> for the owners than for the players. The NFL continued to operate without a collective bargaining agreement until 1993.|$|E
25|$|Favored {{locations}} {{include those}} with narrow shelves (volcanic islands), steep (15-20 degrees) offshore slopes, and relatively smooth sea floors. These sites minimize {{the length of}} the intake pipe. A land-based plant could be built well inland from the shore, offering <b>more</b> <b>protection</b> from storms, or on the beach, where the pipes would be shorter. In either case, easy access for construction and operation helps lower costs.|$|E
25|$|To provide <b>more</b> <b>protection</b> to {{the head}} against impact, to secure the airway, and to permit easy {{communication}} with the surface and between divers, a rigid metal or fibre-reinforced plastic diving helmet may be worn with the dry suit.

25|$|Once seals are used, as much paste as {{possible}} is wiped from the printing surface {{and off the}} edges with a suitable material. The seals are kept in a constant environment, especially seals made of sandalwood or black ox horn. Tall thin seals are best kept on their sides, in case they should wobble and fall down. More important seals, such as authority and society seals are encased or wrapped in a golden silk cloth to add <b>more</b> <b>protection.</b>|$|E
25|$|Small, open-fingered gloves were {{introduced}} to protect fists, reduce the occurrence of cuts (and stoppages due to cuts) and encourage fighters to use their hands for striking to allow more captivating matches. Gloves were first made mandatory in Japan's Shooto promotion and were later adopted by the UFC as it developed into a regulated sport. Most professional fights have the fighters wear 4 oz gloves, whereas some jurisdictions require amateurs to wear a slightly heavier 6 oz glove for <b>more</b> <b>protection</b> for the hands and wrists.|$|E
25|$|In the past, fly ash was {{generally}} {{released into the}} atmosphere, but air pollution control standards now require that it be captured prior to release by fitting pollution control equipment. In the US, fly ash is generally stored at coal power plants or placed in landfills. About 43% is recycled, often used as a pozzolan to produce hydraulic cement or hydraulic plaster and a replacement or partial replacement for Portland cement in concrete production. Pozzolans ensure the setting of concrete and plaster and provide concrete with <b>more</b> <b>protection</b> from wet conditions and chemical attack.|$|E
