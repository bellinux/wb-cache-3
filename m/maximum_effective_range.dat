The gun can be fired while the vehicle is afloat. The gun can also be depressed and elevated between −4 and +30 degrees so like most Soviet tanks, the PT-76 has a limited ability to depress its main gun, and therefore can have difficulty finding a hull down fire position on higher ground. One of the greatest disadvantages of the gun used on the PT-76 Model 1 was that it had no stabilization system and therefore couldn't be effectively fired while the vehicle was on the move. The PT-76 Model 2 has a 1-axis stabilization system and the PT-76B has a 2-axis system.|$|E

25|$|The primary {{armament}} of the BMD-3 is the 30mm 2A42 autocannon in {{the form}} of the original BMP-2 turret. This autocannon is mounted on other vehicles, like the Ka-52 and Mi-28. The 2A42 autocannon is a dual selective feed cannon which is fitted with a distinct muzzle brake and manual weapons laying drives increasing accuracy and consistency. This muzzle brake reduces oscillation of the gun mount at the moment of a round being fired. The practical rate of fire is 200-300 rds/min (rounds per minute) while the cyclic rate of fire is over 550 rds/min. It fires rounds with a muzzle velocity of 960m/s. The BMD-3 has 500 rounds for the 30mm autocannon ready to be used with an additional 360 stowed inside. The <b>maximum</b> <b>effective</b> <b>range</b> when firing AP-T (armor-piercing-tracer) ammunition is 2000 m, and when firing HE-I (high-explosive-incendiary) ammunition is 4000 m against an area target.

5000|$|Rat-shot {{cartridges}} {{are best}} used in dedicated smoothbore firearms such as Marlin Firearms' Model 25MG Garden Gun, but can still provide suitable patterns of shot from rifled barrels at short ranges.

The Thompson Center Arms Contender pistols offered barrels in some calibers, such as [...]357 Magnum and [...]44 Magnum, in configurations that contained special straight rifled choke tubes to improve the patterns produced by the rifled barrels when shooting rat-shot cartridges.

Muzzle velocity is 1,000 m/s. Each clip has 4 rounds, each of which weighs 6.6 kg; the charge in each round consists of 1.2 kg of 11/7 nitrocellulose powder, a projectile weighs 2.8 kg. Maximum horizontal range is 12 km (with an <b>effective</b> <b>range</b> against ground targets of up to 4 km / 2.5 miles.

Fragmentation rounds have a safety-destructor which activates between 12 and 16 seconds after being fired to ensure the shells won't fall back to ground, so the maximum slant range of anti-aircraft fire is 6.5-7 km. BR-281 armour-piercing rounds are able to penetrate 110 mm armour at 500 m or 70 mm armour at 2,000 m (at 90° impact angle).|$|R

The multipurpose warhead has a combined armour-piercing ammunition with enhanced behind armor anti-personnel and incendiary effects. The engine is of reduced smoke design, with IM properties. It is connected to the rear section by a roll bearing that enables it to rotate in flight. There are four small stabilising surfaces at the very rear of the missile in front of the exhaust nozzle that ensures stable flight. Roketsan has developed a new launch pod and a new canister in which Cirit is delivered as an all-up round.

50|$|The <b>maximum</b> <b>effective</b> {{point target}} <b>range</b> of an M4 carbine with M855 rounds is 500 m, with a <b>maximum</b> <b>effective</b> area target <b>range</b> of 600 m. These mark the {{greatest}} distances the rounds {{can be expected}} to accurately hit the target, not the ranges that they have terminal effectiveness against them. Because the M855 is yaw dependent it requires instability in flight to deform upon hitting the target. It is the most stable in flight between 150 - 350 m, potentially lessening its effectiveness if it strikes an enemy between those distances. In addition to this, tests have shown that 5.56 mm bullets fragment most reliably when traveling faster than 2,500 ft/s. From full-length 20 in rifle and machine gun barrels, rounds exhibit velocities above 2,500 ft/s out to 200 m. An M855 fired from a shorter barreled M4 carbine exhibits a bullet velocity of 2,522 ft/s at 150 m range. Even if it impacts at optimum speeds, 70 percent of 5.56 mm bullets will not begin to yaw until 4.7 in of tissue penetration. 15 percent more begin to yaw after that distance, so up to 85 percent of rounds that hit do not start to fragment until nearly 5 in of penetration. Against small statured or thin combatants, the M855 has little chance of yawing before passing through cleanly and leaving a wound cavity no bigger than the bullet itself. The factors of impact angle and velocity, instability distance, and penetration before yaw reduce the round's predictable effectiveness considerably in combat situations.|$|R

2500|$|A mitrailleuse ( [...] ; from French mitraille, [...] "grapeshot") {{is a type}} of {{volley gun}} with {{multiple}} barrels of rifle calibre that can fire either multiple rounds at once or several rounds in rapid succession. The earliest true mitrailleuse was invented in 1851 by Belgian Army Captain Fafschamps, 10 years before the advent of the Gatling gun. It was followed by the Belgian Montigny mitrailleuse in 1863. Then the French 25 barrel [...] "Canon à Balles", better known as the Reffye mitrailleuse, was adopted in great secrecy in 1866. It became the first rapid-firing weapon deployed as standard equipment by any army in a major conflict when it was used during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71. A steel block containing twenty-five 13mm (.51 calibre) centre-fire cartridges was locked against the breech before firing. With the rotation of a crank, the 25 rounds were discharged in rapid succession. The sustainable firing rate of the Reffye mitrailleuse was 100 rounds per minute. The <b>maximum</b> <b>effective</b> <b>range</b> of the Reffye mitrailleuse was about 2000 yards; a distance which placed their batteries beyond the reach of Prussian Dreyse needle rifle fire.
