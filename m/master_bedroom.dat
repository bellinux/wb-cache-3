5|$|The present château, {{designed}} on {{a triangular}} plan, has five conical towers and a watchtower capped by slate roofs. Archaeologists have uncovered {{traces of the}} older buildings on the site {{dating back to the}} 11th century. The architect Frantz Jourdain renovated the interior of the 14th century tower as a library for the Rochefoucault family in 1893. The Hunt of the Unicorn tapestries of the building, which hung in the <b>master</b> <b>bedroom,</b> were rediscovered in 1850; they were later sold to John D. Rockefeller, Jr. in 1923.|$|E
5|$|The First Lady {{secured the}} {{assistance}} of renowned interior designer Ted Graber, popular with affluent West Coast social figures, to redecorate the family living quarters. A Chinese-pattern, handpainted wallpaper {{was added to the}} <b>master</b> <b>bedroom.</b> Family furniture was placed in the president's private study. The First Lady and her designer retrieved a number of White House antiques, which had been in storage, and placed them throughout the mansion. In addition, many of Reagan's own collectibles were put out for display, including around twenty-five Limoges Boxes, as well as some porcelain eggs and a collection of plates.|$|E
5|$|Arson {{investigators}} testified as to {{how they}} had located the origin and cause of the house fire, stressing that the multiple unconnected, small fires they had found in the home's basement were evidence of the fire having been set purposely and that char patterns on the house's floors were evidence of a liquid accelerant having been used to start the fire. The living room floor had contained the most significant amount of accelerant, and the trail of accelerant had ended {{at the door of the}} <b>master</b> <b>bedroom,</b> which had been open while the fire burned. The state of the bedroom door contradicted Green's prior testimony to investigators that her bedroom door had been closed and she had only opened it briefly to look into the hallway.|$|E

5|$|June's {{body and}} {{clothing}} were heavily bloodstained; {{she was found}} in her nightdress with bare feet. The police believe she had been sitting up during part of the attack, based on the pattern of blood on her clothing. She was found {{lying on the floor}} by the door of the <b>master</b> <b>bedroom.</b> She had been shot seven times. One shot to her forehead, between her eyes, was fired from under one foot away. That and another shot to the right side of her head would both have caused her death quickly, the court heard. There were also shots to the right side of her lower neck, her right forearm, and two injuries {{on the right side of}} her chest and right knee.|$|E
5|$|Sheila {{was found}} {{on the floor of the}} <b>master</b> <b>bedroom</b> with her mother. She was in her nightdress, her feet were bare, and she had two bullet wounds under her chin, one of them on her throat. The pathologist, Dr Peter Vanezis, said that the lower of the {{injuries}} had occurred from three inches (76mm) away, and that the higher one was a contact injury. The higher of the two would have killed her immediately. The lower injury would have killed her too, he said, but not necessarily straight away. Vanezis testified that it would be possible for a person with such an injury to stand up and walk around, but the lack of blood on her nightdress suggested to him that she had not done this. He believed that the lower of her injuries had happened first, because it had caused bleeding inside the neck; the court heard that if the immediately fatal wound had happened first, the bleeding would not have occurred to the same extent. Vanesiz said that the pattern of bloodstains on her nightdress suggested she had been sitting up when she received both injuries.|$|E
5|$|Seeing Arnaud felled by gunfire, Magruder, who {{was wearing}} body armor, stepped back and drew her sidearm. However, before she could return fire, Logan then shot six bullets at her, one of which struck her in the head, mortally {{wounding}} her. Logan then went over to Arnaud and, while standing over his body, shot him four more times, injuring his liver and inducing severe internal bleeding. Arnaud would die from severe gunshot-induced blood loss at the scene, but the mortally wounded Magruder was able to call for assistance over her radio at 9:34p.m. Logan's father, {{who was in the}} house's <b>master</b> <b>bedroom,</b> had heard the gunshots, and thinking that the deputies had shot him, went over to see what had happened. Instead, he saw Logan leaving the house with a firearm in hand, and saw that the two deputies had been shot. Logan's father then called 9-1-1 via telephone at 9:39p.m. to report the shooting to authorities. Emergency medical technicians arrived and removed Arnaud and Magruder were removed from the house via stretchers, with Magruder being airlifted via medical helicopter to the Prince George's Hospital Center, with CPR being applied on her while en route. However, she would be pronounced dead at the hospital before midnight.|$|E
