40|$|Abstract. The {{filling process}} of plastic precise gear is {{simulated}} by CAE software and {{the factors that}} influence injection molding accuracy in single cavity mold are discussed in this paper. With the assistant of visualization technology, the mechanism of filling unbalance which influences efficient injection molding was especially studied. The model of filling unbalance was supposed that was verified experimentally by visualization technique. It is clarified that the mechanism of filling unbalance results from dissymmetrical temperature distribution on the cross-section of runner, which is strongly influenced by the shear heat and the cooling process in the runner. At the same time, a new method was proposed for improving the filling imbalance by applying appropriate injection molding process without any changes in runner shape of <b>multi-cavity</b> <b>mold...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Rubber {{injection}} molding is applied in {{more and more}} applications in rubber production process. Design of gating system is the most important in rubber injection mold design. Poor runner design will lead to uneven injection velocity and pressure which affect the size and shape {{and the quality of the}} rubber products. This paper first adopted POLYFLOW numerical simulation. Three different inlet flow rates for <b>multi-cavity</b> <b>mold</b> were simulated and analyzed by POLYFLOW software in this paper. Non-equilibrium gating system was further optimized by the calculation method of Balanced Gate Value and numerical simulation. The best inlet flow rate and the best runner size were ultimately obtained. It was proven that Numerical simulation results are of great significance for rubber injection mold design and {{injection molding}} processing parameter selection...|$|E
40|$|Cavity {{pressure}} {{has been recognized}} as a critical process parameter for the injection molding of high quality plastic parts. Recent developments in injection molding process technology have enabled closed loop control of cavity pressure {{at one point in}} the mold. In this paper, a scheme is described which enables the simultaneous control of cavity pressure at multiple locations in both multi-gated parts and/or <b>multi-cavity</b> <b>molds.</b> This has been achieved by the addition of dynamic valves in the melt delivery system, each of which can be independently controlled to meter the flow and pressure of the polymeric melt to its portion of the mold. The development and capabilities of the control system are presented, demonstrating the feasibility of simultaneous multi-cavity pressure control in both the filling and packing stages of the injection molding process. Due to space limitations, however, the ability of multi-cavity pressure control to improve process capability and molded part quality are presented in a companion paper...|$|R
40|$|The bipolar {{plates of}} fuel cells, {{conductive}} polymer compounds are being tested as promising substitute materials for graphite and metals are discussed. The conductivity {{required for the}} bipolar plate determines what fillers or mixture of fillers are selected. The bipolar plate represents an important structural as well as functional element in the fuel cell. Using metallic materials is another possibility. Metal bipolar plates are manufactured of high-alloy steel and are characterized by very good electrical conductivity as well as mechanical integrity, but have a high density and are quite susceptible to corrosion. A uniform distribution of the fillers in the bipolar plate is essential. A combination of extrusion and stamping permits economical production of bipolar plates for portable applications when the quantity does not justify {{the cost of an}} expensive <b>multi-cavity</b> injection <b>mold...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This study {{reports the}} {{experimental}} investigation on the flow imbalance phenomena during filling symmetrical <b>multi-cavity</b> in injection <b>molding</b> of optic elements. There are two aspects in this study: First, the flow imbalance in the eight-cavity mold with normal H-type symmetric runners were observed and measured with aid of short-shot experiments. Second, {{the effects of}} three processing conditions including injection speed, melt temperature and mold temperature on flow imbalance were investigated. Flow imbalances are consistently observed and quantitatively measured. The results have shown that proper injection speed, high melt and high mold temperature can reduce the flow imbalance...|$|R
40|$|Inoculation {{comparisons}} were made between calcium-bearing, foundry-grade 75 % ferrosilicon (FeSi 75) and a proprietary complex alloy tablet (hereafter {{referred to as}} CAT) to determine their effects on late inoculation. In-mold addition rates for FeSi 75 ranged from 0. 1 % to 0. 3 %; the complex alloy tablets, based on oxy-sulfide chemistry, were added in much smaller amounts, 0. 01 % to 0. 03 %. In-mold inoculation was used simultaneously at three inoculant levels in <b>multi-cavity</b> test <b>molds</b> to evaluate chill tendency, microstructure and Brinell hardness characteristics. Thermal analysis also was used to study the solidification behavior of the base iron {{and the effect of}} FeSi 75 and the complex alloy tablet inoculants on graphite nucleation. Thermal analysis of the base low-sulfur iron was characterized by excessive eutectic undercooling. It was found that an addition of 0. 03 % CAT had an inoculation efficiency comparable with 0. 2 % to 0. 3 % calcium-bearing foundry-grade FeSi 75. CAT addition rates of less than 0. 05 % (based on the test casting weight) were extremely effective for late inoculation of grey irons. Irons inoculated with the CAT were less likely to chill (inclusively as inverse chill) and to develop micro-shrinkage formations, compared with calcium-bearing FeSi 75 treatments. The CAT inoculant can be used at significantly reduced addition levels...|$|R
