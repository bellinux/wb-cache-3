5|$|Kenwood {{has three}} floors: {{on the ground}} floor during the Lennon period the front door opened onto an {{entrance}} hall, where Lennon placed a suit of armour and a gorilla suit. Across the hall was a large living room, which had black carpets, two 18-foot sofas and a marble fireplace. To the left of the hall was a toilet, and through the living room was a dining room, where purple, velvet wallpaper was put up. Adjacent to the dining room, {{at the back of the}} house, was a small sunroom. This was decorated with various pictures, caricatures and stickers, such as the one from the Safe as Milk debut album (1967) by Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band, and one advertising the Monterey Pop Festival. Photos published by The Beatles Book Monthly show the shelves of the sunroom filled with articles such as a large, ornate cross, a Mickey Mouse doll and a <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> <b>pestle,</b> reportedly used by Lennon to mix various combinations of cocaine, amphetamine, barbiturates and LSD. There was also a yellow sofa or chaise-longue upon which Lennon would spend much of his time. It was a present from his aunt, Elizabeth Smith (née Stanley) also known as Mimi. Behind the sunroom was the split-level kitchen where state-of-the-art appliances were installed, so complex that a tutor had to come and give the Lennons lessons in their use.|$|E

A burr grinder uses {{revolving}} elements to shear the seed; a blade grinder cuts the seeds with blades moving at high speed; and a <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> <b>pestle</b> crushes the seeds. For most brewing methods a burr grinder is deemed superior because the grind is more even and the grind size can be adjusted.|$|E

The preparation of this paste includes shrimp paste and shallots and all the ingredients are pounded with a <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> <b>pestle.</b> This paste can be made from dry red chilies and one made from fresh red chilies. Some recipes state that large chilies should be used, others prefer bird's eye chilies.|$|E
25|$|William Gossage {{produced}} low-priced, good-quality soap {{from the}} 1850s. Robert Spear Hudson began manufacturing a soap powder in 1837, initially by grinding the soap with a <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> <b>pestle.</b> American manufacturer Benjamin T. Babbitt introduced marketing innovations that included sale of bar soap {{and distribution of}} product samples. William Hesketh Lever and his brother, James, bought a small soap works in Warrington in 1886 and founded what {{is still one of}} the largest soap businesses, formerly called Lever Brothers and now called Unilever. These soap businesses were among the first to employ large-scale advertising campaigns.|$|E
25|$|Pepper loses {{flavour and aroma}} through evaporation, so {{airtight}} storage helps {{preserve its}} spiciness longer. Pepper can also lose flavour when exposed to light, which can transform piperine into nearly tasteless isochavicine. Once ground, pepper's aromatics can evaporate quickly; most culinary sources recommend grinding whole peppercorns immediately before use for this reason. Handheld pepper mills or grinders, which mechanically grind or crush whole peppercorns, are used for this, sometimes instead of pepper shakers that dispense pre-ground pepper. Spice mills such as pepper mills were found in European kitchens {{as early as the}} 14th century, but the <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> <b>pestle</b> used earlier for crushing pepper have remained a popular method for centuries as well.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{theories}} regarding the fate of the colonists, the most widely accepted one being that they sought shelter with local Indian tribes, and either intermarried with the natives or were killed. In 1607, John Smith {{and other members of the}} successful Jamestown Colony sought information about the fate of the Roanoke colonists. One report indicated that the survivors had taken refuge with friendly Chesapeake Indians, but Chief Powhatan claimed that his tribe had attacked the group and killed most of the colonists. Powhatan showed Smith certain artifacts that he said had belonged to the colonists, including a musket barrel and a brass <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> <b>pestle.</b> However, no archaeological evidence exists to support this claim. The Jamestown Colony received reports of some survivors of the Lost Colony and sent out search parties, but none were successful. Eventually they determined that they were all dead.|$|E
500|$|Bara brith is a fruit loaf {{originating}} from rural Wales, where {{they used a}} <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> <b>pestle</b> to grind the fresh sweet spices. Historically it was made with yeast and butter, though recently {{it is likely to}} be made with bicarbonate of soda and margarine. The fruit included would be dried raisins, currants and candied peel, which would be soaked in cold tea before cooking. Generally served sliced with butter during afternoon tea, it is often known as Welsh tea bread. Bara Brith translates to [...] "speckled bread", but it is also known as teisen dorth in South Wales, where sultanas are included in the recipe, or as torta negra when Welsh settlers brought it to Argentina.|$|E
2500|$|Poppy seeds can {{be ground}} using a generic tool {{such as a}} <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> <b>pestle</b> or a small {{domestic}} type electric blade grinder, or a special purpose poppy seed grinder.

2500|$|Calixarenes are {{difficult}} to produce because random polymerization occurs inside of complex mixtures of linear and cyclic oligomers with different numbers of repeating units. With finely tuned starting materials and reaction conditions, synthesis can also be surprisingly facile. In 2005, researchers produced pyrogallolarene simply by mixing a solvent-free dispersion of isovaleraldehyde with pyrogallol, and a catalytic amount of p-toluenesulfonic acid, in a <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> <b>pestle.</b> Calixarenes are sparingly soluble as parent compounds and [...] melt at high temperatures compared to other crystalline solids.|$|E
2500|$|Another people, {{possibly}} Yukian speakers, lived {{first in}} the Russian River Valley and the Lake Sonoma area. [...] The Pomo slowly displaced them and took over these places. Recently, analysis of archaeological evidence {{has suggested that the}} indigenous historical economy observed by the Spanish at their arrival in the Pomo lands of central California may have first developed during the Mostin Culture period (8500-6300 BP) in the Clear Lake Basin. This was an economy that was based on women processing acorns by <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> <b>pestle.</b>|$|E

Pharmacy organizations often use other symbols, such as the Bowl of Hygieia which is often used in the Netherlands, conical measures, and caduceuses in their logos. Other symbols are common in different countries: the green Greek cross in France, Argentina, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and India, the increasingly rare Gaper in the Netherlands, and a red stylized letter A in Germany and Austria (from Apotheke, the German word for pharmacy, from the same Greek root as the English word 'apothecary').|$|E

2500|$|In ancient China, {{the trip}} hammer evolved {{out of the}} use of the <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> <b>pestle,</b> which in turn gave rise to the treadle-operated tilt-hammer (Chinese: 碓 Pinyin: dui; Wade-Giles: tui). The latter was a simple device {{employing}} a lever and fulcrum (operated by pressure applied by the weight of one's foot to one end), which featured a series of catches or lugs on the main revolving shaft as well. This device enabled the labor of pounding, often in the decorticating and polishing of grain, and avoided manual use of pounding with hand and arm. Although historians assert that its origins may span {{as far back as the}} Zhou Dynasty (1050 BC–221 BC), the earliest texts to describe the device are the Jijiupian dictionary of 40 BC, Yang Xiong's text known as the Fangyan of 15 BC, as well as the Xin Lun written by Huan Tan about 20 AD (during the usurpation of Wang Mang). The latter book states that the legendary mythological king known as Fu Xi was the one responsible for the pestle and mortar (which evolved into the tilt-hammer and then trip hammer device). Although the author speaks of the mythological Fu Xi, a passage of his writing gives hint that the waterwheel and trip-hammer were in widespread use by the 1st century AD in China (for water-powered Chinese metallurgy, see Du Shi): ...|$|E
