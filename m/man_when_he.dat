5|$|Robert Cain {{was born}} in Shanghai on 2 January 1909. His parents were Manx and {{returned}} to the Isle of <b>Man</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was young, where he was educated at King William's College. In 1928 Cain joined the Honourable Artillery Company, a unit of the Territorial Army (TA). The TA was the volunteer reserve force of the British Army and members continued in civilian work; Cain worked in Thailand and Malaya for Shell. He was placed on the supplementary reserve list on 12 February 1931.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his life, Crean {{remained}} an extremely modest <b>man.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> returned to Kerry, he {{put all of}} his medals away and never again spoke about his experiences in the Antarctic. Indeed, there is no reliable evidence of Crean giving any interviews to the press. It has been speculated that {{this may have been}} because Kerry was a hotbed of Irish nationalism and later Irish republicanism, and, along with County Cork, an epicentre of violence. The Crean family were once subject to a Black and Tan raid during the Irish War of Independence. Their inn was ransacked until the raiders happened across Crean's framed photo in Royal Navy dress uniform and medals. They then left his inn.|$|E
5|$|Gervase of Canterbury wrote {{at the end}} of {{the twelfth}} century that Ceolnoth was Dean of the see of Canterbury {{previous}} to being elected to the archiepiscopal see of Canterbury, but this story has no confirmation in contemporary records. There is no sign of him being associated with either Canterbury or Kent, the region where Canterbury is located, prior to his elevation as archbishop. Given the length of his archiepiscopate, he was probably a young <b>man</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was elected to Canterbury. Ceolnoth was consecrated archbishop on 27 July 833. Upon becoming archbishop, Ceolnoth had to deal with two problems– first the Viking attacks on his archbishopric and the surrounding lands in Kent and second the newly ascendant kings of Wessex who had just gained control of Kent. Previously, the Mercian kings had ruled Kent.|$|E

He was awarded the Order of Polonia Restituta on his 110th birthday by the president of Poland. He died on 7 December 2013 at the age of 113. However, his age is not verified, and in any case, Alexander Imich, world's verified oldest <b>man</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> died on June 8, 2014, aged 111, was a veteran from the same war.|$|E

25|$|Robert Dollar {{expressed}} ideas concerning one's legacy after death. He wrote: In {{this world}} all we leave behind us {{that is worth}} anything {{is that we can}} be well regarded and spoken of after we are gone, and that we can say that we left the world just a little better than we found it. If we can't accomplish these two things then life, according to my view, has been a failure. Many people erroneously speak of a <b>man</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> is gone as having left so much money. That, according to my view, amounts to very little.|$|E
25|$|Those {{individuals}} {{who participated in}} the Expo project were also impacted; Mexican interim ambassador Federico Gamboa tells in his memoirs that Spanish sculptor Justo de Gandarias, and elderly <b>man</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> met him on 20 June 1899, was still in Guatemala two years after the failed Expo because the government had not paid him for his services. Two years after that, Gamboa met with the sculptor again, and this time he tells that Gandarias had lost all hope of ever getting paid and that was in Guatemala barely surviving by selling cigarettes in Guatemala City; Gamboa visited Gandarias at his home and tells how the sculptures place was in total disarray, but kept some old paintings and sculptures that he was hoping to sell if he ever went back to Spain.|$|E
25|$|Mark Albert Fowler is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in the BBC soap opera EastEnders. Mark, an original regular character when the series started in February 1985, became a semi-regular after his original portrayer David Scarboro was written out of the role in April 1985. Scarboro made brief returns to the role in 1986 and 1987. Scarboro died by suicide in April 1988, and the role was recast in 1990, with Todd Carty taking on the role. From this point the character was a permanent fixture in the series and Carty remained in the role until the character was written out of the series in early 2003. Initially a delinquent teenager, he became a changed <b>man</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was 22. His contracting HIV forced him to grow up fast and accept his responsibilities. He frequently {{found it difficult to}} accept the restrictions of the illness, which finally claimed his life in April 2004.|$|E

25|$|Biologist Professor Nathan Garrett is {{the direct}} {{descendant}} of Sir Percy, and found Sir Percy's tomb and the Ebony Blade. Garrett's evil tendencies make him unworthy of wielding the sword, {{and he is}} shunned by Sir Percy's ghost. An embittered Garrett then devises an arsenal of medieval weapons that employ modern technology and genetic engineers and creates a winged horse. Calling himself the Black Knight, Garrett embarks {{on a life of}} crime to spite his ancestor. After a battle with the hero Giant-Man Garrett joins the supervillain team the Masters of Evil at the request of master villain Baron Zemo and like the others spreads Adhesive X over the city, but is first defeated by Thor. After two unsuccessful battles with the Avengers, on the second time he was broken out of jail by the Enchantress, and a time when he battled Iron Man due to Doctor Doom's mind-control machine to make supervillains attack Mister Fantastic's and the Invisible Woman's wedding, (which he forgets like the other villains due to a machine created by Mister Fantastic). Garrett is mortally wounded while trying to kill the superhero Iron <b>Man</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> falls off his winged horse. A dying Garrett summons his nephew, Dane Whitman, reveals his secret identity to Whitman, and repents for his life of crime. Whitman then adopts the identity of the Black Knight himself.|$|E
500|$|Morris {{first came}} across {{the story of the}} Volsungs, [...] "the grandest tale that ever was told" [...] as he later called it, as a young <b>man,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> read a summary of it in Benjamin Thorpe's Northern Mythology, which became a {{favourite}} book of his. In his The Earthly Paradise (1868–70) he included a versification of the story of Sigurd's daughter Aslaug, which he may have taken from Thorpe. In 1868 he began to learn Old Norse from the Icelandic scholar Eiríkr Magnússon, and embarked with him on a series of collaborative translations from the Icelandic classics. In 1870 they published Völsunga Saga: The Story of the Volsungs and Niblungs, with Certain Songs from the Elder Edda, claiming uncompromisingly in the preface that [...] "This is the Great Story of the North, which should be to all our race what the Tale of Troy was to the Greeks".|$|E
500|$|In June 2012, {{news outlets}} and music journalists from pre-release {{listening}} events for Channel Orange {{raised questions about}} certain songs' lyrics and Ocean's sexuality. The lyrics addressed a male object of love and deviated from the heterosexual perspective of his past songs. Scrapping his original plan of including it in the album's liner notes, Ocean published a TextEdit file as an open letter through his Tumblr blog on July 4. Originally written in December 2011, it recounted his unrequited feelings for a <b>man</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was 19 years old, citing the experience as his first love. Ocean's disclosure was received with support from Def Jam and praise from other recording artists and cultural commentators. He also remarked on writing Channel Orange after years of emotional struggle with the experience, stating in the letter, [...] "I wrote to keep myself busy and sane. I wanted to create worlds that were rosier than mine. I tried to channel overwhelming emotions." ...|$|E

500|$|Morgan died on 25 August 1688; Albemarle {{ordered a}} state funeral, and laid Morgan's body at King's House {{for the public}} to pay respects. An amnesty was {{declared}} so that pirates and privateers could pay their respects without fear of arrest. He was buried at Palisadoes cemetery, Port Royal, followed by a 22-gun salute from the ships moored in the harbour. Morgan was a wealthy <b>man</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> died. He owned three plantations, had 129 slaves, and his personal wealth was valued at £5,263. In his will, signed 17 June 1688, he left his Jamaican property to his godsons Charles Byndloss and Henry Archbold, on condition they adopted the surname of Morgan. These were the children of his two cousins Anna Petronilla Byndloss and Johanna Archbold. To his sister Catherine Loyd he awarded £60 per annum from his estate [...] "paid into the hands of my ever honest cozen [...] Thomas Morgan of Tredegar".|$|E
500|$|When play resumed, England's Gubby Allen bowled {{an entire}} over to Bradman. As Larwood {{prepared}} to bowl his next over to Woodfull, Jardine changed to the Bodyline field setting. The capacity Saturday afternoon crowd viewed this as hitting a <b>man</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was down. Journalist-cricketer Dick Whitington, wrote that Jardine's actions {{were seen as}} [...] "an unforgivable crime in Australian eyes and certainly no part of cricket". Mass hooting and jeering occurred after almost every ball. Whitington noted that [...] " [...] Hele believes that had what followed occurred in Melbourne the crowd would have leapt the fence and belaboured the English captain; Larwood, and possibly the entire side". Some English players later expressed fears that a large-scale riot and that the police {{would not be able}} to stop the irate home crowd, who were worried that Woodfull or Bradman could be killed, from attacking them. When Larwood immigrated to Australia two decades later, he remained fearful for his safety.|$|E
