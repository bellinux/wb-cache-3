5|$|The basic {{component}} {{sound of a}} Hammond organ comes from a tonewheel. Each one rotates {{in front of an}} electromagnetic pickup. The variation in the magnetic field induces a small alternating current at a particular frequency, which represents a signal similar to a sine wave. When a key is pressed on the organ, it completes a circuit of nine electrical switches, which are linked to the drawbars. The position of the drawbars, combined with the switches selected by the key pressed, determines which tonewheels are allowed to sound. Every tonewheel is connected to a synchronous motor via a system of gears, which ensures that each note remains at a constant relative pitch to every other. The combined signal from all depressed keys and pedals is fed through to the vibrato system, which is driven by a metal scanner. As the scanner rotates around a set of pickups, it changes the pitch of the overall sound slightly. From here, the sound is sent to the <b>main</b> <b>amplifier,</b> and on to the audio speakers.|$|E
25|$|Is the <b>main</b> <b>amplifier</b> block also a two-port? The <b>main</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{is shown}} in the upper shaded box. The ground {{connections}} are labeled. Figure 7 shows the interesting fact that the <b>main</b> <b>amplifier</b> does not satisfy the port conditions at its input and output unless the ground connections are chosen to make that happen. For example, on the input side, the current entering the <b>main</b> <b>amplifier</b> is IS. This current is divided three ways: to the feedback network, to the bias resistor RB and to the base resistance of the input transistor rπ. To satisfy the port condition for the <b>main</b> <b>amplifier,</b> all three components must be returned to the input side of the <b>main</b> <b>amplifier,</b> which means all the ground leads labeled G1 must be connected, as well as emitter lead GE1. Likewise, on the output side, all ground connections G2 must be connected and also ground connection GE2. Then, {{at the bottom of the}} schematic, underneath the feedback two-port and outside the amplifier blocks, G1 is connected to G2. That forces the ground currents to divide between the input and output sides as planned. Notice that this connection arrangement splits the emitter of the input transistor into a base-side and a collector-side – a physically impossible thing to do, but electrically the circuit sees all the ground connections as one node, so this fiction is permitted.|$|E

25|$|The main {{amplification}} {{takes place}} in a series of glass amplifiers located {{at one end of the}} beamlines. Before firing, the amplifiers are first optically pumped by a total of 7,680 xenon flash lamps (the PAMs have their own smaller flash lamps as well). The lamps are powered by a capacitor bank which stores a total of 422MJ (117kWh) of electrical energy. When the wavefront passes through them, the amplifiers release some of the light energy stored in them into the beam. To improve the energy transfer the beams are sent though the <b>main</b> <b>amplifier</b> section four times, using an optical switch located in a mirrored cavity. In total these amplifiers boost the original 6J provided by the PAMs to a nominal 4MJ.

The role of neutrophils as the <b>main</b> <b>amplifiers</b> of liver injury has been recognized in many publications. However, the mechanisms involved in neutrophil recruitment during liver IRI are not well known. Additionally, the molecules necessary for this type of migration are poorly defined.

40|$|The {{cost and}} physics {{requirements}} of the NIF have established two important roles for potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP) crystals. 1. To extract more laser energy per unit of flashlamp light and laser glass, the NIF has adopted a multipass architecture as shown in Figure 1. Light is injected in the transport spatial filter, first traverses the power amplifiers, and then is directed to <b>main</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> where it makes four passes before being redirected through the power amplifiers towards the target. To enable the multipass of the <b>main</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> a KDP-containing Pockels cell rotates the polarization of the beam to make it either transmit through or reflect off a polarizer held at Brewster's angle within the main laser cavity. If transmitted, the light reflects off a mirror and makes another pass through the cavity. If reflected, it proceeds through the power amplifier to the target. the original seed crystal as the pyramid faces grow. Unfortunately, this pyramidal growth is very slow, and it takes about two years to grow a crystal to NIF size. To provide more programmatic flexibility and reduce costs in the long run, we have developed an alternative technology commonly called rapid growth. Through a combination of higher temperatures and higher supersaturation of the growth solution, a NIF-size boule can be grown in 1 to 2 months from a small ''point'' seed. However, growing boules of adequate size is not sufficient. Care {{must be taken to}} prevent inclusions of growth solution and incorporation of atomically substituted 2. Implosions for ICF work far better at shorter wavelengths due to less generation of hot electrons, which preheat the fuel and make it harder to compress. Compromising between optic lifetime and implosion efficiency, both Nova and the NIF operate at a tripled frequency of the 1053 -nm fundamental frequency of a neodymium glass laser. This tripling is accomplished by two crystals, one made of KDP and one made of deuterated KDP (DKDP). The first one mixes two 1053 -nm photons to make 526 -nm light, and the second one combines a residual 1053 -nm photon with a 526 -nm photon to make 351 -nm light...|$|R

Residual amplitude modulation induced in the preamplifiers from the phase modulation is also precompensated in the fiber portion of the system before it is injected into the 48 pre-amplifier modules (PAMs). Each of the PAMs amplifies the light from the 1 nJ fiber injection up to the multi-joule level in two stages.
