40|$|A {{method of}} {{increasing}} the yield of <b>methanol</b> <b>lignin</b> was devised in collaboration with Mr. J. Swartz. Some of the methoxyl groups of completely methylated <b>methanol</b> <b>lignin</b> were shown to be probably anolic in nature. Catalytic reduction of this material, using two of the more recently developed catalysts, Was attempted, the results obtained being entirely negative. The optimum conditions for complete demethylation of the methylated lignin with hydriodic acid were determined, {{and the rate of}} the reaction investigated. The alkoxyl group in the initial material was shown to be exclusively methoxyl. The major solid product of the demethylation was investigated; as obtained it contained iodine, and a method for the removal of the latter was devised. Examination of this material showed that dehydroxylation had occurred to a large extent, and that the residual hydroxyl groups wer e largely (90 %) phenolic in nature. A theory as to the mechanism of this dehydroxylation has been advanced, together with supporting evidence. A comparison of two methods of synthesis of benzo- 2, 3 - (dioxin-l, 4 -dihydride- 5, 6) has been made...|$|E
40|$|A. A new, {{simple and}} {{efficient}} method has been devised for the hydrogenation at high pressures, of small quantities of plant material {{and for the}} analysis and identification of the hydrogenated products. [ [...] . ] C. Each of the various groups of ethanolysis products obtained in the ethanolysis of maple wood meal, and including (1) the distillable oils; (2) the non-distillable amorphous fraction of the water-soluble oils; (3) the so-called "benzene-shakings"; (4) the non-water-soluble tar; (5) the water-insoluble ethanol lignin and (6) the residual lignin in the wood, have been hydrogenated and the resulting products separated, analyzed and very largely identified. D. Based on these results, and on the previously published data on hydrogenation, the type of linkRge (-C-C- or -C-O-C-) present in the individual fractions {{and the extent to}} which these are present, have been determined. E. The experimental data and theoretical consideration would seem to provide a rational working theory of the mechanism of ethanolysis. F. Contrary to general belief, it was found possible to obtain simple water-soluble lignin units by the methanolysis of maple and aspen woods. The water-insoluble <b>methanol</b> <b>lignin</b> (maple) has been hydrogenated and the products shown to be identical with those obtained by hydrogenation of the ethanol lignin (maple).

40|$|In {{regard to}} the {{comparison}} of the lignin in the heart wood {{and that in the}} sap wood of Larix Kaempferi Sarg. by methanol extraction, the authors obtained the following results. 1) The extraction of Larix Kaempferi Sarg. by methanol with a small quantity of hydrochloric acid is very difficult, and the percentage of extraction from the heart wood is about 20 per cent of the total lignin, and that of the sap wood is about 10 per cent. 2) the yield of the <b>methanol</b> <b>lignin</b> is the greatest by means of methanol with 3 per cent hydrochloric acid for dried wood meals, and the methanol-insoluble part in the extract is the smallest among the methanol extractions with various hydrochloric acid quantity. 3) The methanol-soluble methanol-lignin is more soluble than the buthanol lignin. 4) The divergencies between the heart wood lignin and the sap wood lignin by the methanol method are as follows. a) Color : H. W. L. is in general more brown than S. W. L. b) Melting Point : H. W. L. is 15 ℃ higher than S. W. L. c) Mean Molecular Weight : H. W. L. is more than twice as great as H. W. L. d) Methoxyl Radical: H. W. L. has 0. 6 per cent more methoxyl radicals than S. W. L. e) Copper Number : H. W. L. has a greater copper number than S. W. L. the copper number of S. W. L. being about one-third of that of H. W. L...|$|E

Five CIMV lignin fractions were obtained and investigated: 2 fractions obtained by separate extractions with DOX and methanol and 3 fractions obtained {{in the process of}} sequential extraction of CIMV <b>lignin</b> with dichloromethane, <b>methanol</b> and methanol/dichloromethane mixture.

40|$|Soda lignin {{was divided}} into two {{fractions}} with different molecular weights by <b>methanol</b> extraction. <b>Lignin</b> amine was synthesized from the low-molecular-weight lignin fraction via Mannich reaction and was used for interfacial modification of poly-(vinylchloride) (PVC) /wood-flour composites. The PVC/wood-flour composites were prepared from surface-treated wood flour and PVC by melt compounding. The lignin amine treatment provided almost equivalent improvement in mechanical performances of composites as aminosilane treatment does. The tensile and impact strengths of composites prepared from 30 phr of wood flour treated with 2 wt% lignin amine were increased by 21. 0 % and 43. 9 %, respectively, compared to those prepared from untreated wood flour. Furthermore, lignin amine treatment could also significantly reduce the water absorption of composites. A significant increase in storage modulus (E’) was observed upon incorporation of wood flour with lignin amine treatment. The improved dispersion of wood flour in polymer matrix was observed by SEM images when the wood flour was treated by lignin amine. The experimental data indicate that the polymer-wood interfacial combination is strengthened...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This study {{compares the}} {{responses}} of termites to the lignin-degrading basidiomycete, Marasmiellus troyanus (Murrill) Singer, grown on different substrates, and examines the tunneling behavior of termites in sand treated with extracts of fungus-infected pure lignin versus solvent-treated sand. Termites showed a significant preference for lignin infected with M. troyanus versus uninfected lignin and sawdust infected with M. troyanus versus uninfected sawdust, but not cellulose infected with M. troyanus versus uninfected cellulose. When termites were presented {{with a choice of}} lignin versus sawdust, {{there were no significant differences}} in the response of termites in the tests where both substrates were uninfected or where both substrates were infected with M. troyanus. However, in choice tests where only one of the substrates was infected, there were significantly more termites in the fungus-infected substrate. The number of termites was significantly greater in tips containing extract-treated sand compared with tips containing solvent-treated sand for tests with both the pentane and <b>methanol</b> extracts of <b>lignin</b> infected with M. troyanus. These results indicate that M. troyanus produces a chemical during the process of metabolizing lignin that elicits a positive response in termites.

40|$|A {{catalytic}} {{process for}} the upgrading of woody biomass into mono-aromatics, hemi-cellulose sugars and a solid cellulose-rich carbohydrate residue is presented. Lignin fragments are extracted from the lignocellulosic matrix by cleavage of ester and ether linkages between lignin and carbohydrates by the catalytic action of homogeneous Lewis acid metal triflates in <b>methanol.</b> The released <b>lignin</b> fragments are converted into lignin monomers by the combined catalytic action of Pd/C and metal triflates in hydrogen. The mechanism of ether bond cleavage is investigated by lignin dimer models (benzyl phenyl ether, guaiacylglycerol-β-guaiacyl ether, 2 -phenylethyl phenyl ether and 2 -phenoxy- 1 -phenylethanol). Metal triflates are involved in cleaving not only ester and ether linkages between lignin and the carbohydrates but also β-O- 4 ether linkages within the aromatic lignin structure. Metal triflates are more active for β-O- 4 ether bond cleavage than Pd/C. On the other hand, Pd/C is required for cleaving α-O- 4, 4 -O- 5 and β-β linkages. Insight into the synergy between Pd/C and metal triflates allowed optimizing the reductive fractionation process. Under optimized conditions, 55 wt% mono-aromatics - mainly alkylmethoxyphenols - {{can be obtained from}} the lignin fraction (23. 8 wt%) of birch wood in a reaction system comprising birch wood, methanol and small amounts of Pd/C and Al(III) -triflate as catalysts. The promise of scale-up of this process is demonstrated...|$|R
