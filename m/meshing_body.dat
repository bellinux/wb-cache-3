40|$|The {{advent of}} {{tightened}} diesel emission regulations {{has led to}} {{the development and implementation of}} various diesel in-cylinder controls and after-treatment devices. As the most promising after-treatment device in reducing particulate emission from diesel engines, the diesel particulate filter (DPF) was developed in the 1980 s and has undergone notable improvements. The objective of this dissertation is to explore complicated physical processes in the DPF during loading and regeneration. ^ In the 1 -D model, quasi-steady state conservations of mass and momentum are solved by a shooting method coupled with a Runge-Kutta method. A filtration model based on unit collector filtration theory is used to determine transient filtration behaviors of the porous wall. Transient conservations of energy are solved with fully implicit finite difference method to find the temperature field. ^ The major challenge with DPF is the uncertainty of the regeneration process. The exothermic soot oxidation during regeneration leads to sharp rise in local temperature and temperature gradient, which makes the DPF susceptible to melting and cracking. As an extension of the 1 -D model, a quasi 3 -D model is developed to locate hot spots in the DPF. The 3 -D Navier-Stokes equations are solved using order of magnitude analysis and integral method. The 3 -D transient conservation of energy is solved by a modified Alternative-Direction-Implicit (ADI) method to find the temperature distribution, which enables further numerical simulation of thermal stress. ^ A displacement-based finite element method is employed to solve for the 3 -D thermal stress induced by high temperature and temperature gradient during DPF regeneration. This finite element model is self-contained and independent of any commercial package. It includes functions of <b>meshing</b> <b>body,</b> assembling global stiffness matrix and force vector, solving final equilibrium equations and post-processing. ^ Finally, parametric studies are carried out with these three models to investigate the impact of DPF geometric designs on performance. Primary attention is paid to pressure drop, peak temperature and thermal stress, which are associated with diesel thermal efficiency and potential DPF failure due to melting and cracking. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} the determination of the frictional stress distribution from the inversion of the measured surface displacement field for sliding interfaces between a glass lens and a rubber (poly(dimethylsiloxane)) substrate. Experimental results show that high lateral strains are achieved at the periphery of the sliding contacts. As a consequence, an accurate inversion of the displacement field requires that finite strains and non linear response of the rubber substrate are taken into account. For that purpose, a Finite Element (FE) inversion procedure is implemented where the measured displacement field is applied as a boundary condition at the upper surface of a <b>meshed</b> <b>body</b> representing the rubber substrate. Normal pressure is also determined by the same way, if non-diverging values are assumed at the contact edge. This procedure is applied to linearly sliding contacts as well as on twisting contacts...|$|R

40|$|Cooling {{of freshly}} {{harvested}} produce {{is crucial for}} maintaining a high product quality for a prolonged storage period and to reduce postharvest losses. Modelling the cooling process of packed horticultural produce provides a means for improving package designs and cooling operations. In this work, a methodology to more accurately model the cooling process of randomly stacked produce in packages is presented. First, a validated geometrical 3 D shape model generator of apple fruit is used to create realistic CAD models. The generator also considers the biological variability of the produce shape to create a database of more than 100 representative fruits of each cultivar. A discrete element model (DEM) then randomly selects surface <b>meshed</b> <b>bodies</b> from the database to simulate the gravitational packing of produce in a designated box or bin. The resulting stacking pattern of the produce is used to generate a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. The CFD model solves the airflow, heat and mass transfer through the packages to evaluate the aerodynamic and cooling performance of packages under different conditions and configurations. The difference between using actual 3 D fruit shapes and an approach using equivalent spheres is demonstrated in a simulation study of forced airflow cooling of apple fruit (cv. Braeburn) packed in a “Supervent” telescopic corrugated fibreboard package under typical precooling conditions. The results are analysed in terms of pressure drop characteristics, velocity profiles and distribution of cooling rates expressed by local surface heat transfer coefficients. status: accepte...|$|R

40|$|Freshly {{harvested}} horticultural produce {{require a}} proper temperature management {{to maintain their}} high economic value. Towards this end, low temperature storage is of crucial importance to maintain a high product quality. Optimizing both the package design of packed produce and the different steps in the postharvest cold chain {{can be achieved by}} numerical modelling of the relevant transport phenomena. This work presents a novel methodology to accurately model both the random filling of produce in a package and the subsequent cooling process. First, a cultivar-specific database of more than 100 realistic CAD models of apple and pear fruit is built with a validated geometrical 3 D shape model generator. To have an accurate representation of a realistic picking season, the model generator also takes into account the biological variability of the produce shape. Next, a discrete element model (DEM) randomly chooses surface <b>meshed</b> <b>bodies</b> from the database to simulate the gravitational filling process of produce in a box or bin, using actual mechanical properties of the fruit. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is then developed with the final stacking arrangement of the produce to study the cooling efficiency of packages under several conditions and configurations. Here, a typical precooling operation is simulated to demonstrate the large differences between using actual 3 D shapes of the fruit and an equivalent spheres approach that simplifies the problem drastically. From this study, it is concluded that using a simplified representation of the actual fruit shape may lead to a severe overestimation of the cooling behaviour. status: accepte...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{methodology}} for creating 3 -D models for computer graphics applications from 2 -D concept sketches of human characters using minimal user interaction. This methodology will facilitate the fast production {{of high quality}} 3 -D models by non-expert users involved in the development process of video games and movies. The workflow starts with an image containing the sketch of the human character from a single viewpoint, in which a 2 -D body pose detector is run to infer {{the positions of the}} skeleton joints of the character. Then the 3 -D body pose and camera motion are estimated from the 2 -D body pose detected from above, where we take a recently proposed methodology that works with real humans and adapt it to work with concept sketches of human characters. The final step of our methodology consists of an optimization process based on a sampling importance re-sampling method that takes as input the estimated 3 -D body pose and camera motion and builds a 3 -D <b>mesh</b> of the <b>body</b> shape, which is then matched to the concept sketch image. Our main contributions are: 1) a novel adaptation of the 3 -D from 2 -D body pose estimation methods to work with sketches of humans that have non-standard body part proportions and constrained camera motion; and 2) a new optimization (that estimates a 3 -D <b>body</b> <b>mesh</b> using an underlying low-dimensional linear model of human shape) guided by the quality of the matching between the 3 -D <b>mesh</b> of the <b>body</b> shape and the concept sketch.
