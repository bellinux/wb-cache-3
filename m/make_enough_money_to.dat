Lucy, however, leaves without the permission of her overbearing father Pete (Dan Aykroyd), who wakes up the next day to find his daughter is gone. Shortly into their journey, the car breaks down. They realise that they don't have enough money between them for the travel or the repair costs. Mimi then suggests that she sing karaoke at a local bar, where good singers are tipped well by the customers. While at the bar, the girls dress up and go the stage to perform. However, when the song starts Mimi develops stage fright, being unable to sing. Seeing that they needed the money, Lucy takes her place, and quickly becomes a hit with the crowd.

25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Japanese, Okinawan, and Korean men {{traveled}} to Hawaii as cheap labor {{to work on}} the sugarcane plantations. Some continued on {{to work on the}} mainland. These men had originally planned to leave plantation work and go back home after a few years or a contract was up. Between the years of 1886 and 1924, 199,564 Japanese entered Hawaii and 113,362 returned to Japan. However, many men did not <b>make</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> go back home. Also, in 1907 the Gentlemen's Agreement prohibited immigration from Hawaii to the United States for laborers. Because now these men were put in situations with limited mobility, they had to make Hawaii or the United States their home, and part of that was getting married. In Hawaii, the plantation owners also wanted to see the laborers get married. Though they had originally preferred single men, when the contract labor system was abolished, the owners thought that wives would make the men more likely to settle down and stay. Also, the plantation owners hoped that wives would limit the amount of gambling and opium smoking the workers did, and act as a morale booster for the men.|$|E
25|$|Three months later, Tony {{returns to}} Miami. All of his assets have been frozen, and {{the districts of}} Miami he used to {{dominate}} have been divided among other drug cartels.

As Tony has no real power anymore, he has little choice. He next travels to see his old friend and contact Felix (Carlos Ferro), who tells him Sosa is working with Gaspar Gomez (Cheech Marin) {{in an effort to}} take over all of Tony's old turf. He also warns Tony there are very few dealers who can be trusted anymore, as most report back to Sosa. Tony says he needs to make some small deals so he can <b>make</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> buy his mansion back from the Vice Squad, and begin to rebuild his empire. Felix advises him to speak to a bartender named Coco (Willa Holland). She puts him in touch with some dealers, as he slowly begins to re-establish his name, earning enough to re-purchase his mansion. He calls Felix, who tells him that he thinks Gaspar is smuggling cash. Tony steals one of Gaspar's trucks, carrying $50,000, and uses it to open a bank account. Reconnecting with his old banker, Jerry (Michael York), Montana uses the bank to launder his money as he sets out to reclaim control of Little Havana from the Diaz Brothers. As Tony's reputation increases, the brothers attempt to have him killed. He survives the assassination attempt, and one of the killers tells him the Diazes have murdered his mother.

500|$|The {{game was}} {{criticized by the}} South China Morning Post for lacking documentation, making it more {{difficult}} to learn how to play the game. They also predicted that players would be unhappy with the game's speed, as time {{plays an important role in}} earning money from tenants. Before the player can purchase new facilities, a long period of time must pass before income is earned from tenants. The newspaper was also unhappy with complaints from tenants; specific reasons for their dissatisfaction are never given. The Age was disappointed by the lack of pre-built towers and scenarios, suggesting that one along the lines of The Towering Infernos plot could have been included. Game Informer referred to SimTower as a [...] "lesser-known" [...] simulation game, and described it as [...] "fun and addictive". Writing for the San Diego Union-Tribune, Matt Miller felt that, when compared to SimCity 2000 (1993), gameplay in SimTower moved slowly. He also disliked the moments when he had to wait several minutes to pass by before he could <b>make</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> purchase new additions for his building. Dragon magazine's reviewers Jay and Dee praised the visuals and gameplay. However, the two commented that the game can feel slow because it lacks gameplay elements and options present in other strategy games.

The family is visited by a representative of a game reserve, who says their acres of open land similar to African Savannah {{would be a good}} habitat for the elephant to live in. However, as the family is pondering what to do about Stampy, a wildlife poacher named Mr. Blackheart offers to buy Stampy. Homer wants to take the money, but Lisa is against the idea — particularly since Mr. Blackheart openly admits he plans to have Stampy killed for his ivory tusks.
