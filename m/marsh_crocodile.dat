40|$|The {{present study}} of {{ecological}} impacts on <b>Marsh</b> <b>crocodiles</b> in Manghopir {{was carried out}} in the months of January to December 2008. In order to assess, the microbial contamination, detection of pollutant indicator organisms in water samples, to determine the physico-chemical parameters were performed. The detection of different physico-chemical parameters which are temperature of air and water, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, calcium, magnesium, bicarbonate, chloride, sodium, potassium, sulphur, carbonate, biological oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen were analyzed with the recognized standard method of WHO collected water samples from the Manghopir Karachi. <b>Marsh</b> <b>crocodiles</b> are reported endangered around the world due to the vulnerability of marshy habitat to increase pollution and environmental deterioration. Toxic chemical contaminants were estimated below the detection range, while some other chemicals were found within the normal level recognized by WHO.
