50|$|All {{microbes}} {{ranging from}} the smallest bacteria to the largest <b>multicellular</b> <b>eukaryote</b> contains a membrane with phospholipids. A phospholipid molecule is composed of a long fatty acid, often called {{the tail of the}} molecule, and a phosphate group, which serves {{as the head of the}} molecule. Phospholipid membranes can range widely in the structure of the fatty acid tail, which is composed of mostly hydrocarbons. These phospholipid molecules form bilayers with the polar phosphate groups facing the aqueous solution inside or outside of the cell with the hydrocarbons facing inward interacting with each other. The membrane, along with proteins, controls which molecules are allowed in or out of the cell. For this reason, the membrane plays a crucial role in the survival of the cell. A faulty membrane can allow too many solutes into the cell, resulting in cell death.|$|E
5000|$|Abundant {{evidence}} indicates that facultative sexual eukaryotes tend to undergo sexual reproduction under stressful conditions. For instance, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (a single-celled fungus) reproduces mitotically (asexually) as diploid cells when nutrients are abundant, but switches to meiosis (sexual reproduction) under starvation conditions. [...] The unicellular green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii grows as vegetative cells in nutrient rich growth medium, but depletion of a source of nitrogen in the medium leads to gamete fusion, zygote formation and meiosis. [...] The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, treated with H2O2 to cause oxidative stress, substantially increases the proportion of cells which undergo meiosis. [...] The simple <b>multicellular</b> <b>eukaryote</b> Volvox carteri undergoes sex in response to oxidative stress or stress from heat shock.

40|$|The {{molecular}} components {{involved in}} {{the survival of the}} parasitic nematode Trichinella spiralis in an intracellular environment are poorly characterized. Here we demonstrate that infective larvae secrete a nucleoside diphosphate kinase when maintained in vitro. The secreted enzyme forms a phosphohistidine intermediate and shows broad specificity in that it readily accepts γ-phosphate from both ATP and GTP and donates it to all nucleoside and deoxynucleoside diphosphate acceptors tested. The enzyme was partially purified from culture medium by ATP affinity chromatography and identified as a 17 -kDa protein by autophosphorylation and reactivity with an antibody to a plant-derived homologue. Secreted nucleoside diphosphate kinases have previously been identified only in prokaryotic organisms, all of them bacterial pathogens. The identification of a secreted variant of this enzyme from a <b>multicellular</b> <b>eukaryote</b> is very unusual and is suggestive of a role in modulating host cell function...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{contrast}} to bacterial, fungal and vertebrate ornithine transcarbamylases (OTCs; EC 2. 1. 3. 3), {{very little is}} known about the enzyme in plants.

Transcript mapping revealed that at least 22 bp within the OTC-AUL 1 intercoding region are transcribed from both strands, which makes this one of the rarely described cases of convergent and overlapping transcription units in the nuclear genome of a <b>multicellular</b> <b>eukaryote.</b> Transcription of the OTC gene was shown to be ubiquitous in aerial organs of adult plants, whereas that of AUL 1 was obscured by the existence of a putative second copy of the gene.

40|$|Dynamic {{acetylation}} of all lysine- 4 -trimethylated histone H 3 is {{a complex}} phenomenon involved in Immediate-early gene induction in metazoan eukaryotes. Higher eukaryotes express repeated copies of three closely related H 3 variants, inaccessible to genetic analysis. We demonstrate conservation of these phenomena in Dictyostelium which has three single-copy H 3 variant genes. Although dynamic acetylation is targeted to two H 3 variants which are K 4 -trimethylated, K 9 -acetylation is preferentially targeted to one. In cells lacking Set 1 methyltransferase and any detectable K 4 -trimethylation, dynamic acetylation is lost demonstrating a direct link between the two. Gene replacement to express mutated H 3 variants reveals a novel interaction between K 4 -trimethylation on different variants. Cells expressing only one variant show defects in growth, and in induction of a UV-inducible gene, demonstrating the functional importance of variant expression. These studies confirm that dynamic acetylation targeted to H 3 K 4 me 3 arose early in evolution and reveal {{a very high level}} of specificity of histone variant utilization in a simple <b>multicellular</b> <b>eukaryote...</b>|$|E

40|$|With the {{expansion}} of the RNA world, antisense strategies have become widespread to manipulate nuclear gene expression but organelle genetic systems have remained aside. The present work opens the field to mitochondria. We demonstrate that customized RNAs expressed from a nuclear transgene and driven by a transfer RNA-like (tRNA-like) moiety are taken up by mitochondria in plant cells. The process appears to follow the natural tRNA import specificity, suggesting that translocation indeed occurs through the regular tRNA uptake pathway. Upon validation of the strategy with a reporter sequence, we developed a chimeric catalytic RNA composed of a specially designed trans-cleaving hammerhead ribozyme and a tRNA mimic. Organelle import of the chimeric ribozyme and specific target cleavage within mitochondria were demonstrated in transgenic tobacco cell cultures and Arabidopsis thaliana plants, providing the first directed knockdown of a mitochondrial RNA in a <b>multicellular</b> <b>eukaryote.</b> Further observations point to mitochondrial messenger RNA control mechanisms related to the plant developmental stage and culture conditions. Transformation of mitochondria is only accessible in yeast and in the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas. Based on the widespread tRNA import pathway, our data thus make a breakthrough for direct investigation and manipulation of mitochondrial genetics...|$|E
40|$|N 6 -Methyladenosine is a {{ubiquitous}} modification {{identified in}} the mRNA of numerous eukaryotes, where it is present within both coding and noncoding regions. However, this base modification does not alter the coding capacity, and its biological significance remains unclear. We show that Arabidopsis thaliana mRNA contains N 6 -methyladenosine at levels similar to those previously reported for animal cells. We further show that inactivation of the Arabidopsis ortholog of the yeast and human mRNA adenosine methylase (MTA) results in failure of the developing embryo to progress past the globular stage. We also demonstrate that the arrested seeds are deficient in mRNAs containing N 6 -methyladenosine. Expression of MTA is strongly associated with dividing tissues, particularly reproductive organs, shoot meristems, and emerging lateral roots. Finally, we show that MTA interacts in vitro and in vivo with At FIP 37, a homolog of the Drosophila protein FEMALE LETHAL 2 D and of human WILMS ’ TUMOUR 1 -ASSOCIATING PROTEIN. The results reported here provide direct evidence for an essential function for N 6 -methyladenosine in a <b>multicellular</b> <b>eukaryote,</b> and the interaction with At FIP 37 suggests possible RNA processing events that might be regulated or altered by this base modification...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Motile cilia are {{essential}} to the survival and reproduction of many eukaryotes; they are responsible for powering swimming of protists and small multicellular organisms and drive fluids across respiratory and reproductive surfaces in mammals. Although tremendous progress has been made to comprehend the biochemical basis of these complex evolutionarily-conserved organelles, few protein kinases have been reported to co-ordinate ciliary beat. Here we present evidence for p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p 38 MAPK) playing a role in the ciliary beat of a <b>multicellular</b> <b>eukaryote,</b> the free-living miracidium stage of the platyhelminth parasite Schistosoma mansoni. RESULTS: Fluorescence confocal microscopy revealed that non-motile miracidia trapped within eggs prior to hatching displayed phosphorylated (activated) p 38 MAPK associated with their ciliated surface. In contrast, freshly-hatched, rapidly swimming, miracidia lacked phosphorylated p 38 MAPK. Western blotting and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that treatment of miracidia with the p 38 MAPK activator anisomycin resulted in a rapid, sustained, activation of p 38 MAPK, which was primarily localized to the cilia associated with the ciliated epidermal plates, and the tegument. Freshly-hatched miracidia possessed swim velocities between 2. 17 - 2. 38 mm/s. Strikingly, anisomycin-mediated p 38 MAPK activation rapidly attenuated swimming, reducing swim velocities by 55...|$|E

40|$|Abstract For most amino acids, {{more than}} one codon can be used. Many {{hypotheses}} have been put forward to ac-count for patterns of uneven use of synonymous codons (codon usage bias) that most often have been indirectly tested primarily by analyses of patterns. Direct ex-perimental tests of effects of synonymous codon usage are available for unicellular organisms, however empirical data addressing this problem in <b>multicellular</b> <b>eukaryotes</b> are sparse. We have developed a flexible transfecting plasmid {{that allows us to}} empirically test the effects of different codons on transcription and translation and present data from Drosophila. We could detect no significant effects of codon usage on transcription. With regard to translation, optimal codons (most used) produce higher levels of pro-tein expression compared to non-optimal codons if the effect of difference in thermodynamic stability of sec-ondary structure of the 50 mRNA ribosome-binding site is controlled for. These results are consistent with what has been found in bacteria and thus expand the generality of these principles to <b>multicellular</b> <b>eukaryotes...</b>|$|R
