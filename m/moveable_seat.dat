Another <b>moveable</b> <b>seat</b> was mounted on rails running the whole length of the cabin; it could be locked in any position on the rails giving access to the side windows. A window was fitted between the pilots' seats to allow drift readings to be made and a further floor window aft allowed a vertical camera to be used.|$|E
40|$|<b>Moveable</b> <b>seats</b> in {{multipurpose}} public halls {{increased in}} the Kinki district of Japan from 1960 to 2011. This study traced the dissemination of <b>moveable</b> <b>seats</b> from the viewpoints of regional location, scale and time of introduction. Of the 402 multipurpose public halls constructed from 1960 to 2011, 199 had <b>moveable</b> <b>seats.</b> The number of halls constructed peaked in the 1990 s and decreased to 2011. In the 2000 s, more than 40 % of the halls constructed had <b>moveable</b> <b>seats.</b> Hyogo prefecture had {{the greatest number of}} such halls, followed by Osaka prefecture. Most were small halls (499 seats or less), with 60 % of the small halls in the Kinki district having <b>moveable</b> <b>seats...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} office tasks on posture and movements in field settings, and the comfort rating for chair characteristics and correlation with type of task. The tasks studied were: computer work, telephoning, desk work and conversation. Postures, movements, chair part inclinations and comfort rating {{data were collected from}} 12 subjects. Computer work showed the lowest physical activity, together with upright trunk and head position and low backrest inclination. Conversation shows the highest activity of head legs and low back together with the highest cervical spine extension. In contrast, desk work provoked the most cervical spine flexion and showed the second lowest activity. The telephoning tasks showed medium activity and the highest kyphosis. Conversation showed the highest backrest inclination. Positive comfort relations were found for computer work and a "swing system" chair, for telephoning and an active longitudinal seat rotation, and for desk work and a chair with a three-dimensionally <b>moveable</b> <b>seat.</b> © 2011...|$|E

50|$|Upgrades {{included}} restumping {{the building}} with steel, replacing the roofing iron and correcting the roof's sag with steel reinforcement, bracing walls, refixing much of the exterior cladding, and replacing interior linings and the ceiling. Asbestos boards used in the building were replaced with modern materials. The fixed seating was removed and was replaced with <b>moveable</b> <b>seating</b> built by Page Furnishers, and the organ chamber was rebuilt and extended. The roof of the stage was raised to match {{the roof of the}} auditorium, the floor of the dressing room was raised to stage level, and new sliding doors were installed {{at the rear of the}} building. The former Majestic Cafe was refurbished for use as Valentino's Restaurant, while the former shop space to the right of the main entrance was refurbished as a modern kitchen. The sprung dance floor was sanded back and oiled, the toilet area was modernised, and a snack and beverages bar was installed in the foyer. New paths and ramps have been added around the building's exterior.|$|R
25|$|Following the {{prototype}} were three Model A45T aircraft, {{the first two}} with the same engine as {{the prototype}} and the third with a Continental E-225, which {{would prove to be}} close to the production version. Production did not begin until 1953, when Beechcraft began delivering T-34As to the United States Air Force (USAF) and similar Model B45 aircraft for export. Production of the T-34B for the United States Navy (USN) began in 1955, this version featuring a number of changes reflecting the different requirements of the two services. The T-34B had only differential braking for steering control on the ground instead of nosewheel steering, additional wing dihedral and, to cater for the different heights of pilots, adjustable rudder pedals instead of the <b>moveable</b> <b>seats</b> of the T-34A. T-34A production was completed in 1956, with T-34Bs being built until October 1957 and licensed B45 versions built in Canada (125 manufactured by Canadian Car and Foundry), Japan (173 built by Fuji Heavy Industries), and Argentina (75 by FMA) until 1958. Beechcraft delivered the last Model B45s in 1959. Total production of the Continental-engined versions in the US and abroad was 1,904 aircraft.|$|R

40|$|It {{has long}} been known that sound fields {{rotating}} around a stationary, blindfolded observer can elicit self-motion illusions ("circular vection") in 20 [...] 60 of participants. Here, we investigated whether auditory circular vection might depend on whether participants sense and know that actual motion is possible or impossible. Although participants in auditory vection studies are often <b>seated</b> on <b>moveable</b> <b>seats</b> to suspend the disbelief of self-motion, it has never been investigated whether this does, in fact, facilitate vection. To this end, participants were seated on a hammock chair with their feet either on solid ground ("movement impossible" condition) or suspended ("movement possible" condition) while listening to individualized binaural recordings of two sound sources rotating synchronously at 60 °/s. In addition, hardly noticeable vibrations were applied in half of the trials. Auditory circular vection was elicited in 8 / 16 participants. For those, adding vibrations enhanced vection in all dependent measures. Not touching solid ground increased the intensity of self-motion and the feeling of actually rotating in the physical room. Vection onset latency and the percentage of trials where vection was elicited were only marginally significantly (p<. 10) affected, though. Together, this suggests that auditory self-motion illusions can be stronger when one senses and knows that physical motion might, in fact, be possible (even though participants always remained stationary). Furthermore, there was a benefit both of adding vibrations and having one's feet suspended. These results have important implications both for our theoretical understanding of self-motion perception and for the applied field of self-motion simulations, where both vibrations and the cognitive/perceptual framework that actual motion is possible can typically be provided at minimal cost and effort...|$|R
50|$|Saitama Super Arena (Saitama Sūpā Arīna) is a {{multi-purpose}} indoor stadium {{located in}} Chūō-ku, Saitama City, Saitama, Japan.

It is also the only Japanese arena equipped especially for American football. The arena features a gigantic <b>moveable</b> section of <b>seating</b> which can reduce capacity for smaller events and create a more intimate setting.|$|R
60|$|The {{mouth in}} its {{earliest}} condition alone {{remains to be}} described; in S. vulgare, it is seated on a very slight prominence, in a most remarkable situation, namely, in a central point between the bases of the three pairs of legs. I traced by dissection the oesophagus for some little way, until lost in the cellular and oily matter filling the whole animal, and it was directed anteriorly, which is the direction {{that might have been}} expected, from the course followed by the oesophagus in the larva in the last stage, and in mature Cirripedes. Mr. A. Hancock has called my attention to a probosciformed projection on the under side of the larva of Lepas fascicularis, when just escaped from the egg. Mr. Bate has described this same proboscis in Balanus and Chthamalus, and states the important fact, that it is capable of being moved by the animal; and, lastly, I have seen it in an Australian Chthamalus, and in Ibla, of remarkable size. This proboscis, which is always directed posteriorly, (like the mouth in the mature animal,) certainly answers to the mouth as made out by dissection in Scalpellum; and I believe I saw, as has Mr. Bate, a terminal orifice: it certainly does not possess any trophi. In Ibla (in which the larva is large enough for dissection), the base of the proboscis arises posteriorly to the first pair of legs, and the orifice at the other end reaches beyond or posteriorly to the point, where the mouth in Scalpellum opens, namely between the middle pair of legs. The mouth being either so largely probosciformed or seated only on a slight eminence, in two genera so closely allied as Ibla and Scalpellum, and (judging from Mr. Thompson's figures, and from what I have seen myself,) in the species of the same genus Lepas, is a singular difference: in the cases in which, at first, the proboscis is absent, it would probably soon be developed. I cannot but suppose that the inwardly directed spines on the bases of the two posterior legs, which are so rapidly developed, serve some important end, namely, as organs of prehension for the larvæ, like the mandibles and maxillæ of mature Cirripedes, for seizing their prey, and conveying it to their <b>moveable</b> mouths, conveniently <b>seated</b> for this purpose.|$|R
