40|$|AISI 304 {{austenitic}} stainless steel is generally regarded as difficult to <b>machine</b> <b>steels</b> on account of their high strength, high work hardening tendency and poor thermal conductivity. The machinability of AISI 304 was investigated by some researchers using uncoated and coated carbide inserts, but its machinability using advanced cutting inserts like alumina was not explored adequately. Therefore, in this paper the machinability of AISI 304 is being evaluated by machining (CNC turning process) the work material using alumina inserts. The machinability is evaluated in terms of surface finish achieved on the work piece, tool wear encountered and tool life achieved by the inserts for various machining time and the cutting zone temperature generated during the process...|$|E
50|$|Free <b>machining</b> <b>steel</b> is steel {{that forms}} small chips when machined. This {{increases}} the machinability {{of the material}} by breaking the chips into small pieces, thus avoiding entanglement in the machinery. This enables automatic equipment to run without human interaction. Free <b>machining</b> <b>steel</b> with lead also allow for higher machining rates. Free <b>machining</b> <b>steel</b> costs 15 to 20% more than a standard steel, but this is made up by increased machining speeds, larger cuts, and longer tool life.|$|R

40|$|The {{industrial}} activity in many fields implies {{the utilization of}} middle alloy steels, which are subjected at cyclic non-isothermal stresses that characterize their func-tioning. Thus, can be enumerate some examples like: forging equipment, fire guns, chemical equipment, heavy-duty mechanical brakes a. s. o. The metallic structures cyclic non-isothermal stressed are subjected at thermal stresses and strains, which together with the microstructural transformations imply the cracks appearance, and finally the structure damage. For a correctly choosing and using of metallic material, {{it is necessary to}} determine their intrinsic characteristics regarding their cyclic non-isothermal stresses durability. The paper presents the methodology used by authors for determination of the <b>machine</b> <b>steels</b> cyclic non-isothermal stressed durability, and some results obtained for several steel types...|$|E
40|$|According to {{the latest}} state of art {{material}} with a significantly higher content of carbon and sulphur than conventional steels can be welded by conventional methods only in a limited way. Welds carried out with a solid-state laser however, indicate that perfect welds for such materials are capable of being produced when following certain parameters. The report deals with the results that were found on five typical <b>machine</b> <b>steels</b> (0. 2 %<S< 0. 3 %) and two conventional tool steels (C= 0. 9 %).

50|$|Free <b>machining</b> <b>steels</b> are {{carbon steels}} that have sulfur, lead, bismuth, selenium, tellurium, or {{phosphorus}} added.
