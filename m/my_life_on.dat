25|$|Griffin divulged in her standup {{that she}} is now banned from The View after talking about the gig on her {{televised}} comedy special, Kathy Griffin: Straight to Hell. While declining to discuss the ban on Access Hollywood, during the filming of an episode for <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> <b>on</b> the D-List with former View co-host/moderator Rosie O'Donnell, Griffin did talk about the ban, specifically targeting View executive producer Bill Geddie. Griffin had also been mentioned as a possible replacement for Walters when she departed the show. As of August 2009, Griffin had been un-banned from The View and was a guest on September 18, 2009, and June 15, 2010. However, {{in an interview on}} The Talk, Griffin has stated she has been re-banned from The View, due to an argument with View co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck. Griffin has since been unbanned once again and has appeared several times on the show, including as a guest co-host.|$|E

500|$|In August 2014, Shahid Kapoor {{expressed}} {{his desire to}} reprise Ram Charan's role in a Hindi remake saying, [...] "I have been wanting to do Magadheera for the longest. I have seen the film and loved it.....I think it’s a killer subject." [...] In late November 2014, Sajid Nadiadwala confirmed that he would direct the film's Hindi remake with Kapoor as the lead. When asked by Subhash K. Jha the reason for not directing the Hindi remake, Rajamouli said [...] "I've already spent two years of <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>on</b> it. I’d rather make something else. Magadheera was my toughest film to make. Very tiring." [...] By June 2016, Kapoor was no longer part of the Hindi remake. The film was dubbed in Hindi under the same name by Goldmines Movies and released in 2015.|$|E

500|$|The Japanese {{perception}} is remarkably different; Satō and Kabosu are rather {{known as a}} pet and owner rather than a meme, and her blog is the fourth-most popular pet-related blog in the country as of December 2013. Reacting to the meme, she explained, [...] "To be honest, some pictures are strange for me, but it's still funny! I’m very impressed with their skills and taste. Around me, nobody knows about the doge meme. Maybe I don't understand memes very well, because I'm living a such an analog life." [...] Satō has also expressed that she had learned that [...] "the risk of the internet is that {{anyone in the world}} can see <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>on</b> my blog". Fleming stated that in his experience, the Shiba Inu breed has become more recognised due to the meme.|$|E
500|$|In Nashville, Swift {{worked with}} {{experienced}} Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and The Warren Brothers. She eventually formed a lasting {{working relationship with}} Liz Rose. They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school. Rose thought that the sessions were [...] "some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write {{about what happened in}} school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks". Swift was signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house, but left RCA Records when she was 14. She later recalled: [...] "I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>on</b> an album while they still represented what I was going through".|$|E
500|$|Following Allen's {{failed attempt}} on St. John, {{many of his}} men drifted away, presumably drawn by the needs of home and farm. Arnold then began asserting his {{authority}} over Allen for control of Ticonderoga and Crown Point. Allen publicly {{announced that he was}} stepping down as commander, but remained hopeful that the Second Continental Congress was going to name [...] "a commander for this department ... Undoubtedly, we shall be rewarded according to our merit". Congress, for its part, at first not really wanting any part of the affair, effectively voted to strip and then abandon the forts. Both Allen and Arnold protested these measures, pointing out that doing so would leave the northern border wide open. They both also made proposals to Congress and other provincial bodies for carrying out an invasion of Quebec. Allen, in one instance, wrote that [...] "I will lay <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>on</b> it, that with fifteen hundred men, and a proper artillery, I will take Montreal". Allen also attempted correspondence with the people of Quebec and with the Indians living there in an attempt to sway their opinion toward the revolutionary cause.|$|E

500|$|According to her suicide note, Alcorn {{had felt}} [...] "like a girl {{trapped in a}} boy's body" [...] since she was four, and came to {{identify}} as a transgender girl {{from the age of}} fourteen, when she became aware of the term. According to her note, she immediately informed her mother, who reacted [...] "extremely negatively" [...] by claiming that it was only a phase and that God had made her a male, so she could never be a woman. She stated that this made her hate herself, and that she developed a form of depression. Her mother sent her to Christian conversion therapists, but Alcorn later related that here she only encountered [...] "more Christians" [...] telling her that she was [...] "selfish and wrong" [...] and [...] "should look to God for help." [...] Aged sixteen, she requested that she be allowed to undergo transition treatment, but was denied permission: in her words, [...] "I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> <b>On</b> my 16th birthday, when I didn't receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep." ...|$|E
500|$|On his {{spectrum}} of theistic probability, which has seven levels between 1 (100% {{belief in a}} God) and 7 (100% belief that gods do not exist), Dawkins has said he's a 6.9, which represents a [...] "de facto atheist" [...] who thinks [...] "I cannot know for certain but I think God is very improbable, and I live <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>on</b> the assumption {{that he is not}} there." [...] When asked about his slight uncertainty, Dawkins quips, [...] "I am agnostic to the extent that I am agnostic about fairies {{at the bottom of the}} garden." [...] In May 2014, at the Hay Festival in Wales, Dawkins explained that while he does not believe in the supernatural elements of the Christian faith, he still has nostalgia for the ceremonial side of religion. In addition to beliefs in deities, Dawkins has criticized other irrational religious beliefs such as Jesus turned water into wine, that an embryo starts as a blob, that magic underwear will protect you, that Jesus was resurrected, that semen comes from the spine, that Jesus walked on water, that the sun sets in a marsh, that the Garden of Eden existed in Missouri, that Jesus' mother was a virgin, that Muhammad split the moon, and that Lazarus was raised from the dead.|$|E
500|$|Following Heywood's {{arrival in}} Portsmouth his family sought help from their wide circle of {{influential}} friends, {{and set out}} to secure the best available legal counsel. Most active on Heywood's behalf was his older sister Hester ("Nessy"), who gave her brother unqualified support, writing to him on 3 June: [...] "If the transactions of that day were as Mr. Bligh represented them, such is my conviction of your worth and honor that I will without hesitation stake <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>on</b> your innocence. If on the contrary you were concerned in such a conspiracy against your commander, I shall be firmly convinced that his conduct was the occasion of it." [...] Heywood sent his personal narrative of the mutiny to the Earl of Chatham, who was First Lord of the Admiralty and brother to the prime minister, William Pitt. This was a step Heywood subsequently regretted; he had not consulted his lawyers, and his narrative contained statements that Heywood later rescinded {{on the grounds that they}} were [...] "the errors of an imperfect recollection". On 8 June Nessy was advised by her and Heywood's uncle, Captain Thomas Pasley, that on the basis of information from the returned Pandora crew [...] "...your brother appears by all account to be the greatest culprit of all, Christian alone excepted ... I have no hope of his not being condemned." [...] Later, however, Pasley was able to offer some comfort; Captain Montagu of Hector, where Heywood was held, was Pasley's [...] "particular friend". By chance another Heywood naval relative by marriage, Captain Albemarle Bertie, was in Portsmouth Harbour with his ship , moored alongside Hector. Mrs Bertie, and Edgar's officers, were frequent visitors to Heywood, bringing gifts of food, clothing and other comforts.|$|E
