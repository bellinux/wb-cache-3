50|$|By {{controlling}} the stoichiometry and steric {{properties of the}} alkoxide, such reactions can be arrested leading to metal-oxy-alkoxides, which usually are oligonuclear complexes. Other alcohols can be employed in place of water. In this way one alkoxide {{can be converted to}} another, and the process is properly referred to as alcoholysis (unfortunately, there is an issue of terminology confusion with transesterification, a different process - see below). The position of the equilibrium can be controlled by the acidity of the alcohol; for example phenols typically react with alkoxides to release alcohols, giving the corresponding phenoxide. More simply, the alcoholysis can be controlled by selectively evaporating the <b>more</b> <b>volatile</b> <b>component.</b> In this way, ethoxides can be converted to butoxides, since ethanol (b.p. 78 °C) is more volatile than butanol (b.p. 118 °C).|$|E

The distribution of the component in the two phase is governed by the vapour-liquid equilibrium relationship. In practice, distillation may {{be carried out by}} either two principal methods. The first method is based on the production of vapor boiling the liquid mixture to be separated and condensing the vapors without allowing any liquid to return to the still. There is no reflux.

We perform a Granger causality test that shows that the persistent current account deficits in the years from unification to World War I were generated by variations in capital inflows, as hypothesized by Fenoaltea, and not by the dynamics of GDP, as in the Bonelli-Cafagna model. Finally, we show that these capital inflows prompted an industrial investment cycle in equipment and machinery but not - as claimed by Fenoaltea (1988) - a general investment cycle which included also construction and <b>more</b> <b>volatile</b> <b>components</b> of investment.

50|$|The {{apparatus}} is assembled {{as in the}} diagram. (The diagram {{represents a}} batch apparatus {{as opposed to a}} continuous apparatus.) The mixture is put into the round bottomed flask along with a few anti-bumping granules (or a Teflon coated magnetic stirrer bar if using magnetic stirring), and the fractionating column is fitted into the top. The fractional distillation column is set up with the heat source at the bottom on the still pot. As the distance from the stillpot increases, a temperature gradient is formed in the column; it is coolest at the top and hottest at the bottom. As the mixed vapor ascends the temperature gradient, some of the vapor condenses and revaporizes along the temperature gradient. Each time the vapor condenses and vaporizes, the composition of the <b>more</b> <b>volatile</b> <b>component</b> in the vapor increases. This distills the vapor {{along the length of the}} column, and eventually the vapor is composed solely of the <b>more</b> <b>volatile</b> <b>component</b> (or an azeotrope). The vapor condenses on the glass platforms, known as trays, inside the column, and runs back down into the liquid below, refluxing distillate. The efficiency in terms of the amount of heating and time required to get fractionation can be improved by insulating the outside of the column in an insulator such as wool, aluminium foil or preferably a vacuum jacket. The hottest tray is at the bottom and the coolest is at the top. At steady state conditions, the vapor and liquid on each tray are at equilibrium. The most volatile component of the mixture exits as a gas at the top of the column. The vapor at the top of the column then passes into the condenser, which cools it down until it liquefies. The separation is more pure with the addition of more trays (to a practical limitation of heat, flow, etc.) Initially, the condensate will be close to the azeotropic composition, but when much of the ethanol has been drawn off, the condensate becomes gradually richer in water. The process continues until all the ethanol boils out of the mixture. This point can be recognized by the sharp rise in temperature shown on the thermometer.|$|E

40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} studies are performed {{to determine the}} size, history and lifetime of evaporating sessile drops of binary liquid mixtures. The minimum and maximum drop lifetimes (equivalent to the maximum and minimum vaporization rates, respectively) occur at the azeotropic compositions of {{the positive and negative}} azeotropes, respectively. The mechanisms leading to the extremum drop lifetime are due to the changes in composition of the <b>more</b> <b>volatile</b> <b>component</b> during the vaporization process. This composition change tends to suppress vaporization. A new dimensionless parameter is found to determine the intensity of vaporization of a binary liquid drop. Theoretical predictions of the drop size, history and lifetime agree satisfactorily with experimental results...|$|E

40|$|The {{composition}} of some commercial Citrus oils, lemon, sweet orange, and tangerine, designated for aromatherapy, was examined {{before and after}} partial evaporation in a stream of nitrogen. The intact oils contained the expected mixtures of mono- and sesquiterpenes, with hydrocarbons dominating and lesser amounts of oxygenated analogues making up the remainder. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to follow alterations in the relative amounts of the various components present as evaporation proceeded. Changes were marked, and in particular <b>more</b> <b>volatile</b> <b>components</b> present in the intact oils rapidly disappeared. Thus the balance of content was shifted away from monoterpene hydrocarbons towards the analogous alcohols and carbonyl compounds. The results of this differential evaporation are discussed and possible consequences for aromatherapy use are noted.

50|$|The {{composition}} of the gas that is flashed is dependent on many factors, therefore {{it is suggested that}} all extractions be analyzed to determine accurate compositional values. As a generality, this definition applies to the nature of flashing hydrocarbons (HC) that make up oil and natural gas, “If the saturated liquid is a multi-component liquid (for example, a mixture of propane, isobutane and normal butane), the flashed vapor is richer in the <b>more</b> <b>volatile</b> <b>components</b> than is the remaining liquid". Although the flashed portion will be primarily components with higher volatilities (lighter HC), heavier HC will also flash into the vapor phase to some extent. Composition of flash gas is highly dependent on temperature and pressure and can therefore be manipulated using these control variables to become a usable resource (natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGL’s), alternative fuels, etc.) if proper infrastructure and sponsorship is in place.|$|R

40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{capillary}} effects in laser-engraved grooves filled with ordinary liquids and self-rewetting fluids, i. e. dilute aqueous solutions of high carbon number alcohols that show surface tension minima versus temperature. Two different geometries of grooves have been realized and investigated, with triangular and trapezoidal sections. The research activity {{has been focused}} on the experimental study of capillary rising in both types of grooves, using pure and self-rewetting liquids with well characterized surface tension and contact angle properties. In particular, self-rewetting fluids exhibit improved wettability, especially on aluminium surfaces, in comparison to water; {{this is a very important}} property to guarantee inflow into micro-channels. Using theoretical models available in the recent literature capillary rising has been predicted in the capillary structure for of the different fluids, including Ethanol and self-rewetting solutions of Water-Butanol at several concentrations. The experiments carried out using Ethanol show a good agreement with the theoretical predictions; on the contrary, in the case of self-rewetting solutions, higher values of experimental capillary rising eights are obtained. In the latter case, when evaporation occurs, the concentration of the <b>more</b> <b>volatile</b> <b>component</b> is reduced and the surface tension increases. This effect may be the main responsible of the higher capillary rising of the self rewetting solutions. In addiction, the difference in surface tension, caused by evaporation of the <b>more</b> <b>volatile</b> <b>component,</b> causes a Marangoni flow towards the region with a lower alcohol concentration. The coupled effect of increasing capillary pressure at liquid-vapour interface and the inverse Marangoni flow could justify the experimental results. Numerical simulations are carried out to explain the different phenomena...|$|E

The different solutions are then compared from the economical point of view, in terms of COP, refrigeration power and air temperature at the evaporator outlet, adopting an iteration method. This method determines the real composition of a zeotropic mixture working in a compression plant, when only the temperature and pressure values at the expansion valve inlet and outlet are known...|$|R

40|$|Ink {{analysis}} {{is central to}} questioned document examination. We applied direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry (DART MS) to ballpoint, gel, and fluid writing ink analysis. DART MS acquires the mass spectrum of an ink while it is still on a document without altering {{the appearance of the}} document. Spectra were acquired from ink on a variety of papers, and the spectrum of the blank paper could be subtracted out to produce a cleanly isolated ink spectrum in most cases. Only certain heavy or heavily processed papers interfered. The time since an ink is written on paper has a large effect on its spectrum. DART spectra change radically during the first few months after an ink is written as the <b>more</b> <b>volatile</b> <b>components</b> evaporate, but the spectra stabilize after that.

40|$|The {{evaporation}} of {{a liquid}} drop on a solid substrate is a remarkably common phenomenon. Yet, {{the complexity of}} the underlying mechanisms has constrained previous studies to spherically symmetric configurations. Here we investigate well-defined, non-spherical evaporating drops of pure liquids and binary mixtures. We deduce a universal scaling law for the evaporation rate valid for any shape and demonstrate that more curved regions lead to preferential localized depositions in particle-laden drops. Furthermore, geometry induces well-defined flow structures within the drop that change according to the driving mechanism. In the case of binary mixtures, geometry dictates the spatial segregation of the <b>more</b> <b>volatile</b> <b>component</b> as it is depleted.
