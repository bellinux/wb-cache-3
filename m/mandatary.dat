If he were an independent agent, he could not have been a conductor operis. Since the court held that that is what he was, “it should be assumed that he was obliged to further his principal’s interests.” What Kerr finds “puzzling” about the decision is that the court did not discuss {{whether or not he was}} a <b>mandatary.</b> If he had an obligation to further his principal’s interests, the category of <b>mandatary</b> would have been “the more appropriate.” ...|$|E
50|$|Mandate (mandatum or lastgeving) is a {{contract}} {{in which one}} person, the <b>mandatary,</b> undertakes to perform some lawful task for another, the mandator. In Roman-Dutch law, the contract {{was said to be}} essentially gratuitous. If the parties agreed on a payment for the services rendered, the contract was one of letting and hiring of work or services: locatio conductio operis or operarum respectively. It was accepted in practice, however, that the mandator might offer a reward or honorarium, not in payment but in gratitude, for the mandatary's services. There is no objection in modern law to the remuneration of the <b>mandatary,</b> with the result {{that it is difficult to}} distinguish the contract of mandate from that of letting and hiring of work or services.|$|E

50|$|In Roman law, the <b>mandatary</b> {{was not the}} {{mandator}}’s representative. Where the mandator concluded {{contracts with}} third parties in executing the mandate, the <b>mandatary</b> did so in his own name {{and not on the}} mandator’s behalf. The rights and duties under such contract were the mandatary’s alone. While the mandator could indirectly acquire rights against the third party by means of cession, he she could not do so directly. The position in modern law is different. The mandate may well include a power to represent the mandator, but it need not do so. For example, a person wishing to sell a house will often instruct an estate agent merely to find a suitable purchaser with whom the seller might conclude the sale personally, but may also authorise the estate agent to sell the property on the seller’s behalf.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{authorisation}} and {{the contract}} of mandate are distinct juristic acts, {{the rules that}} govern the termination of the agent’s authority to bind the principal {{are not necessarily the}} same as those governing the termination of the contractual relationship between the principal and agent. The contract of mandate may be terminated by any of the methods applicable to contracts generally: for example, by performance or by the mutual consent of the parties. An executory contract of mandate may, however, generally be terminated by the unilateral act of either party—revocation by the mandatory (principal) or renunciation by the <b>mandatary</b> (agent)—unless the express or implied terms of the contract dictate otherwise. This rule, which runs contrary to accepted contractual principles, is derived from the common law, where mandate was essentially a gratuitous contract. In modern law, the <b>mandatary</b> is usually remunerated for services rendered; in such cases, at least, it is doubtful whether the contract is freely terminable at either party’s will.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} of archival material {{has shown the}} significance of the preparations for the negotiations that terminated in the acceptance of the Italian mandate and enabled the beginning of the negotiations for the subsequent Treaty of Osimo. Following the 1954 Memorandum of Understanding, the Italian side used the legal aspect of the agreement as a pretext for stalling over the final resolution of the border delineation issue, claiming that the situation with Zone B of the Free Territory of Trieste was only temporary. Italy also asked for some minor corrections near the border already defined by the Paris Peace Treaty. In 1968, the events in Czechoslovakia and the advanced age of President Tito persuaded the Italian government to start tackling the open issues with Yugoslavia. In that year, the Italian foreign minister, Medici, proposed a package of eighteen items, which included the suggestion that the demarcation line defined by the Memorandum of Understanding become a state border with territorial provisions and which was accepted as a negotiation platform for further dialogue at the meeting of ministers Medici and Miniæ held in Dubrovnik in March of 1973. Hereit is possible to observe a quality shift in the interstate relations and the negotiation process leading to the Treaty of Osimo. After several years of stalling, the Italian side had agreed that two <b>mandataries</b> be nominated in Dubrovnik in place of the previous experts, whose task would be the preparation of the draft of the final agreement. At the same time, Italy was given concrete deadlines for the fulfilment of its obligations. Alongside the official diplomatic channel the two ministers privately agreed on a special, parallel channel for secret negotiations of political <b>mandataries</b> as an alternative that would allow the negotiations to be continued should the likewise secret diplomatic negotiations fail to progress. The political leadership of Italy, especially the Christian Democracy party wanted to use this other channel to establish a direct dialogue parallel to the state relations directed by official diplomacy. The Italian suggestion for negotiations outside the institutional frameworks, when the states precluded from negotiations the respective foreign ministries, eventually proved the only real possibility for arriving at an agreement. The diplomatic negotiations ended towards the end of 1973 without any success. At that time the other channel was not quite active yet, all respective developments having come to a yearlong standstill soon after the establishment of the latter. After several poignant diplomatic notes and President Tito 2 ̆ 7 s Sarajevo speech, Andreotti, in his speech held in Udine in May, 1974, announced Italy 2 ̆ 7 s intention to reach an appropriate agreement with Yugoslavia. In view of the forthcoming Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to be heldin Helsinki and the fundamental principle concerning the finality of stateborders, the leadership of Christian Democracy estimated that an unsolvedborder issue was compromising global Italian politics. Following a correction to the Italian mandate and the arrival of the Italian delegation at Strmol in July, 1974, the Yugoslav side accepted the Italian proposal of negotiations between special political <b>mandataries.</b> This ended the preparations for the negotiations that successfully concluded with the signing of a Treaty in Osimo...|$|R
50|$|The provincial diet, until 1886 {{represented}} by the Westphalian estates of the realm elected their president titled land captain. In the course of strengthening selfrule in the provinces the Westphalian provincial diet was reorganised as the legislation composing of representatives elected from the assemblies of the rural counties and independent cities in 1886. These districts and cities then formed the public-law corporation called the provincial federation (Provinzialverband). The elected speaker of the provincial diet, first titled land director (Landesdirektor), but renamed land captain in 1889, was simultaneously head of the provincial government, called provincial committee (Provinzialausschuss). Between 1920 and 1933 the provincial diet was directly elected by the Westphalian electorate. As of 1933, {{in the course of}} the abolition of parliamentarism in Nazi Germany, the land captains were appointed by the central Prussian government, presided over by Hermann Göring, and became subject to the directives of their respective upper president. Kolbow was still elected, by a provincial diet dominated by Nazi <b>mandataries,</b> his successors were appointed, with the diet officially dissolved in 1934.

5000|$|A major {{scholarly}} {{attack on}} the basis of democracy was made by German-Italian political scientist Robert Michels who developed the mainstream political science theory of the iron law of oligarchy in 1911. Michels argued that oligarchy is inevitable as an [...] "iron law" [...] within any organization as part of the [...] "tactical and technical necessities" [...] of organization and on the topic of democracy, Michels stated: [...] "It is organization which gives birth to the dominion of the elected over the electors, of the <b>mandataries</b> over the mandators, of the delegates over the delegators. Who says organization, says oligarchy" [...] and went on to state [...] "Historical evolution mocks all the prophylactic measures that have been adopted for the prevention of oligarchy." [...] Michels stated that the official goal of democracy of eliminating elite rule was impossible, that democracy is a façade legitimizing the rule of a particular elite, and that elite rule, that he refers to as oligarchy, is inevitable. Michels had formerly been a Marxist but became drawn to the syndicalism of Sorel, Eduoard Berth, Arturo Labriola, and Enrico Leone and had become strongly opposed parliamentarian, legalistic, and bureaucratic socialism of social democracy and in contrast supported an activist, voluntarist, anti-parliamentarian socialism. Michels would later become a supporter of fascism upon Mussolini's rise to power in 1922, viewing fascism's goal to destroy liberal democracy in a sympathetic manner.|$|R

5000|$|It is {{not only}} in case law that one has {{difficulty}} with the term “independent contractor.” An example of a difficulty in statute law {{is to be found}} in the law relating to estate agents. The term “independent contractor” does not normally mean an employee, but rule 3.15 of the Estate Agent’s Code of Conduct speaks of an estate agent’s being “in the service of” another estate agent “as [...] [...] [...] an independent contractor.” Item 3 of the Specification of Services said that “a person rendering any of the aforesaid services paras (a)(i), (a)(ii) or (a)(iii) of the definition of ‘estate agent’ in the Act as an independent contractor shall be deemed to do so as an employee of an estate agent.” Delport suggests that the purpose of the Notice was to rectify the problem which arose as a result of the introduction of the expression “independent contractor” in section 26 of the Act. Kerr does not think that “deeming” all independent agents and <b>mandataries</b> (if that is what is meant in this context by “independent contractors”) to be “employees” either “solves, or is a suitable way to solve, the problem.” Section 26 of the Act was intended to ensure that all those practising as estate agents had fidelity fund certificates. It referred to “an independent contractor rendering services to” an estate agent. “Rendering services” appears to Kerr to have been be used in the general sense; “it does not appear to mean that independent agents have contracts of locatio conductio operarum.” ...|$|R

5000|$|Where {{the mandate}} involves, or is coupled with, a power (or authority) to {{represent}} the mandator, the <b>mandatary</b> is an agent.

At other times, it is used to refer to the contractual relationship between the principal and agent: the so-called [...] "contract of agency" [...] that in reality is a species of mandate. Very often, the term is used in a broad sense to embrace both the contract between the principal and agent, and the concept of representation. This usage, while criticised, is almost inescapable because both mandate and representation are obviously fundamental elements of the field of law generally referred to as the law of agency.|$|E
40|$|Dutch {{prosecutors}} {{are members of}} the judiciary, charged with executing the tasks of the Public Prosecution Service (PPS). Their role is quasi-judicial, like that of a magistrate. However, they do not enjoy the same independence as judges. Their activities are partly determined by government policy, so they also have a role as public servants. Furthermore prosecutors can be seen as frontline workers as they must meet demands made by law, policy, the courts and the other participants in a criminal case in order to have their decisions accepted easily (and thus in order to work efficiently). In 1985 Van de Bunt conceptualized these three prosecutorial roles and showed the tensions to which they give rise. I present new research into the conception of and fulfilment of the duties by Dutch public prosecutors. It is based on participant observation (conducted in 2011), interviews and literature study. Public prosecutors still experience tension between the three ideal-typical roles. The institutionalization of the PPS adds a new dimension to that tension, which partly determines the quasi-judicial role of prosecutors. This can lead to the paradoxical situation that directives force a prosecutor to follow certain protocols or bureaucratic procedures in order to guarantee the quasi-judicial nature of his actions. Meanwhile, as frontline workers, they risk showing formal behaviour, preoccupied with procedural demands. While this is primarily indicative of tension between frontline worker and public servant, this preoccupation can {{stand in the way of}} quasi-judicial considerations. Prosecutors also sometimes demonstrate compliant behaviour: they acquiesce in (overly) high organizational thresholds that prevent them from acting in a quasi-judicial manner. They accept, for example, that <b>mandataries</b> take decisions on prosecution that lack quality. Concerns have been voiced about the ‘institutional preoccupation’ of the PPS, which could hinder autonomous, quasi-judicial decision-making by prosecutors in individual cases. Certain leading members of the PPS openly doubt the usefulness of the concept of the prosecutor as a magistrate. Nowadays, {{prosecutors are}} supposed to be all-rounders, e. g. with proficiency in (process) management. The professionalization of the PPS and its prosecutors is emphatically mooted, but the big question remains whether there will be enough room for the quasi-judicial role of the prosecutor. My fieldwork showed that this role is already under pressure in certain situations. Prosecutors will always be faced with tensions between their three ideal-typical roles. The high and also diffuse expectations could lead to an identity crisis for both the public servant and the magistrate, while the frontline worker may eventually resort to working as formally and compliantly as possible. Given the inequality of the playing field, this would enhance the position of the public servant. And that in its turn is worrying. The intrinsic added value of public prosecutors lies in their qualities as magistrates and their autonomous judgements based on values of ‘Rechtsstaat’. The PPS must guarantee the transparency that makes autonomy and quasi-judicial considerations visible. On the other hand, prosecutors must also demand their own autonomy and should not accept working conditions that obscure the quasi-judicial nature of their job...|$|R

The objective is to design an optimal reorientation trajectory for a rigid body spacecraft under constraints, which is originally formulated as a nonlinear programming problem. The attitude forbidden zones are consid-ered to prevent the light-sensitive instruments operated on-board from exposure to bright light while the mandatory zones are to keep the communication instrument in certain zones to transmit and receive signals. When unit quaternions are used to represent the attitude of spacecraft, the dynamics and constraints are formulated as quadratic functions. By discretizing the reorientation trajectory into discrete nodes, the optimal attitude control problem can be formulated as general quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP). An iterative rank minimization approach is proposed to gradually approach to the optimal solution of nonconvex QCQP.

40|$|Overview]: There {{have been}} three major interrelated trends in global markets {{over the last three}} decades that have brought the concept of {{information}} quality (IQ) to the forefront of management attention. These trends are as follows: Innovation: The current era is associated with widespread and successive waves of technology-driven innovations in information and communication technologies (lCT). Technologies such as the Internet, electronic commerce, World Wide Web (www) and mobile commerce bring with them ubiquitous connectivity, real-time access and overwhelming volumes of data and information. Information economy: The world has experienced a transition from an industrial economy to an information economy. Data and information have become as much a strategic necessity for an organisation's well being and future success as oxygen is to human life (Eckerson, 2002). Almost every activity in which an enterprise engages requires data. Data are the critical inputs into almost alJ strategic and operational decisions ofan enterprise (Eckerson, 2002; Redman, 2001). <b>Mandatary</b> requirements: Organisations realise that they must provide the quality information expected by their customers 'or run the risk of legislation that forces them to provide such quality' (English & Perez, 2003). ...|$|E

His rejection of Christianity in favor of Neoplatonic paganism caused him to be called Julian the Apostate (Greek 'Aποστάτης or Pαραβάτης = 'Transgressor') by the Church. He was the last Emperor of the Constantinian dynasty, the Empire's first Christian dynasty. The substitution of the Roman Republic by Hellenistic oriental monarchy, the process extending through three centuries, found its legal-theoretical justification in the Hellenistic theory of a monarch as a live or spiritualized law (νόμος εμψυχος, lex animata).

40|$|Synopsis This {{thesis is}} focused on the rights, which {{accompany}} the performer. Does not aim to focus on the details of individual institutions, but rather to organize informations about the rights attaching to the performer and artistic performance. In four chapters the author tries to depict these rights since their inception, since the creation of an artistic performance to the moment when the performance become a part of public domain, as well as the right to the these free artistic performances. The first chapter is an introduction to the subject, defines the legal concepts - an author, performer, author's work, artistic performance etc. and also covers the concept non- legal - art, in spite of its abstractness, to author of this thesis seems to be crucial in the legal definition of a performer.

40|$|During World War I the Allies {{supported}} the centrifugal thrusts {{of the ethnic}} and religious groups hostile to the Ottoman Empire. But the promises of a great unified Arab State, of a Kurdish State, of an Armenian State and of an Assyrian State were patently irreconciliable. The division of the Ottoman Kurdistan removed the protection of autochthonous communities (Armenians, Assyro-Chaldeans, Kurds and Yezidis) so that they became the internal problem of Iraq, Syria and Turkey. These peoples have  consequently become transnational. Dispersed through various Middle Eastern States, they {{have been forced to}} create different policies, and to pursue different objectives. The passage from multinational identity has had dramatic consequences for each of these people, whereas the Arab and Turkish States pursued a nationalistic policy aimed at creating a new identity for the whole population. The available documentation in the archives of the Ministry of Italian Foreign Affairs enables a broader and deeper understanding of the tensions and problems, with special reference to Iraq. Nonetheless, these diplomatic observateurs are interesting because they create the atmosphere of this historical period. Italian politics seemed to agree to the rigid application of the Lausanne Treaty and the maintaining of the status quo. Fascism follows a pro-Arab strategy which leaves no room for developing a strategy toward the Middle Eastern communities. A section is devoted to the Syrian Jazira that, being at the Turkish and Iraqi border, represented an important observation post to follow the Kurdish and Assyro-Chaldean problems in those years. The refugees coming from the two countries sheltered in the region because of the politics of tending to integrate them. These politics were pursued by the French <b>mandatary</b> power...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - This paper investigates {{mandatory}} {{and voluntary}} disclosure practices of non-financial listed {{companies on the}} Belgrade Stock Exchange. The results help in determining the level of transparency of Serbian s listed companies and in formulating recommendations for improving the quality and relevance of disclosed information. Design/methodology/approach - We focus on modeling both mandatory and voluntary disclosure indices for financial and non-financial information in order to evaluate the level of disclosure of 63 Serbian companies for reporting period 2012. Findings - We found {{the low level of}} both mandatory and voluntary disclosures. Concerning <b>mandatary</b> disclosure, the information that is least frequently disclosed by the sample companies are those related to the material content of the financial statements (information on changes in accounting estimates and corrections of fundamental errors in the previous period, as well as related companies). Serbian companies usually disclose information that contributes to their greater visibility. Similar to the mandatory disclosure, usually published voluntary information are mostly "neutral" from the point of impact on the values reported in the financial statements, which do not contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the financial position, profitability and cash flows of the company. Research limitations/implications - There is a limitation concerning the sample size (which is generally intrinsic to Serbian capital market size) and the sample structure (research is limited to listed non-financial companies). The study covers the annual reports for 2012 which in Serbia coincides with a crisis period. The same research methodology could be applied on a larger and comprehensive database (non-listed companies) and include period after 2012, which will allow the analysis of evolution of disclosure practices by companies within new accounting framework. Originality/value - The authors give some recommendations for improving the relevance of financial and non-financial disclosures in order to increase the efficiency of capital markets...|$|E
