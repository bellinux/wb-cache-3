50|$|Some {{companies}} outsource their shredding to shredding services. These companies either shred on-site, with <b>mobile</b> <b>shredder</b> trucks or have off-site shredding facilities. Documents {{that need}} to be destroyed are often placed in locked bins that are emptied periodically.|$|E
40|$|In 2004, {{management}} at Uniminâ€™s Gleason, Tennessee, operation began implementing ergonomic interventions specifically targeted {{to reduce the}} risk of musculoskeletal injuries (MSIs). Together with corporate and site management, Unimin identified worksite hazards and began to modify work practices and equipment. Some interventions were relatively simple and were implemented immediately. Others, such as improvements to a <b>mobile</b> <b>shredder,</b> were more complex but were eventually resolved through a participatory approach with employees, management, manufacturers and NIOSH. This paper discusses ergonomic interventions that were successfully implemented using a participatory approach to reducing the risk of injury...|$|E
50|$|On October 30, 2013 in an {{interview}} with CNBC, Hawk discussed plans for a future entry to the series. Hawk later confirmed that the new entry to the series would be a <b>mobile</b> exclusive spin-off, <b>Shred</b> Session. Shortly after its soft launch in 2014 the game was postponed indefinitely and removed from the markets it had been released in.|$|R
40|$|Commercial {{medical waste}} {{treatment}} technologies include incineration, melting, autoclaving, and chemical disinfection. Incineration disinfects, destroys the original nature of medical waste, {{and reduces the}} waste volume by converting organic waste content to carbon dioxide and water, leaving only residual inorganic ash. However, medical waste incinerator numbers have plummeted from almost 2, 400 in 1995 to 115 in 2003 and to about 62 in 2005, due to negative public perception and escalating compliance costs associated with increasingly strict regulations. High-temperature electric melters have been designed and marketed as incinerator alternatives, {{but they are also}} costly and generally must comply with the same incinerator emissions regulations and permitting requirements. Autoclave processes disinfect medical waste at much lower operating temperatures than incinerators operate at, but are sometimes subject to limitations such as waste segregration requirements to be effective. Med-Shred, Inc. has developed a patented <b>mobile</b> <b>shredding</b> and chemical disinfecting process for on-site medical waste treatment. Medical waste is treated on-site at customer facilities by shredding and disinfecting the waste. The treated waste can then be transported in compliance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) requirements to a landfill for disposal as solid municipal waste. A team of Idaho National Laboratory engineers evaluated the treatment process design. The process effectiveness has been demonstrated in mycobacterium tests performed by Analytical Services Incorporated. A process description and the technical and performance evaluation results are presented in the paper. A treatment demonstration and microbiological disinfecting tests show that the processor functions as it was intended...|$|R
50|$|Once {{vehicles}} in a wrecking yard {{have no more}} usable parts, the hulks are usually sold to a scrap-metal processor, who will usually crush the bodies on-site at the yard's premises using a <b>mobile</b> baling press, <b>shredder,</b> or flattener, with final disposal occurring within a hammer mill which smashes the vehicle remains into fist-sized chunks. These chunks are then sold by multiple tons for further processing and recycling.|$|R
50|$|He was {{defeated}} in 1999 by political newcomer, attorney Bobby Bright, in an election that stunned many in the community who thought Folmar's re-election likely. Bright later served one term in the United States House of Representatives from 2009 to 2011. After leaving the city limelight, Folmar went into a <b>mobile</b> document <b>shredding</b> venture before being appointed in 2003 by Governor Bob Riley to run the state Alcoholic Beverage Control Board where he served a relatively quiet tenure as the agency's commissioner until Riley left office early in 2011. Folomar battled cancer and other health ailments in recent years before he died at the family home {{on the evening of}} November 11, 2011. On the night of Folmar's death, current Mayor Todd Strange lauded the former city leader as his mentor, inspiration, a good man, a family man, a Christian and a valuable leader of the city.|$|R
40|$|Scrap tires {{represent}} a significant disposal and recycling {{challenge for the}} United States. Over 280 million tires are generated on an annual basis, and several states have large stockpiles or abandoned tire piles that are slated for remediation. While most states have programs to address the accumulation and generation of scrap tires, most of these states struggle with creating and sustaining recycling or beneficial end use markets. One of the major issues with market development has been {{the costs associated with}} transporting and processing the tires into material for recycling or disposal. According to a report by the Rubber Manufactures Association tire-derived fuel (TDF) represents the largest market for scrap tires, and approximately 115 million tires were consumed in 2001 as TDF (U. S. Scrap Tire Markets, 2001, December 2002, www. rma. org/scraptires). This market is supported primarily by cement kilns, followed by various industries including companies that operate utility and industrial boilers. However the use of TDF has not increased and the amount of TDF used by boiler operators has declined. The work completed through this cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) has shown the potential of a <b>mobile</b> tire <b>shredding</b> unit to economically produce TDF and to provide an alterative low cost fuel to suitable coal-fired power systems. This novel system addresses the economic barriers by processing the tires at the retailer, thereby eliminating the costs associated with hauling whole tires. The equipment incorporated into the design allow for small 1 -inch chunks of TDF to be produced in a timely fashion. The TDF can then be co-fired with coal in suitable combustion systems, such as a fluidized bed. Proper use of TDF has been shown to boost efficiency and reduce emissions from power generation systems, which is beneficial to coal utilization in existing power plants. Since the original scope of work outlined in the CRADA could not be completed because of lack of progress by the CRADA members, the agreement was not extended beyond February 2004. The work completed included the detailed design of the mobile unit, a general economic analysis of the operating the system, and outreach activities...|$|R
