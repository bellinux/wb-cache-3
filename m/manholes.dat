5|$|In 2015, Riverkeeper was alerted of a sewage leak in the kill, noting {{high levels}} of {{bacteria}} indicating the presence of fecal matter. A New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) investigation found nearby private sewer pipes and <b>manholes</b> {{to be filled with}} sludge; they were cleaned and plans have been instated to ensure that sewers would stay clear henceforth. An oil spill was observed in the kill in 2016 and DEC staff were again sent to respond. The DEC installed booms to absorb the oil and began an investigation into the spill's source, which was unknown as of December 6.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} form a {{watertight}} unit, a packaged metering <b>manhole</b> is provided with a solid fiberglass base {{at the bottom of}} the <b>manhole</b> barrel. The base can serve not only as the bottom of the <b>manhole,</b> but also as a means of anchoring the <b>manhole</b> to a concrete slab (required to counteract the buoyant forces on the <b>manhole).</b>|$|R
50|$|Larger primary devices (and transitions) that do {{not readily}} fit into a {{standard}} 4-foot m pre-cast <b>manhole</b> barrel, either a larger barrel or a concrete vault must be used - adding cost. The packaged metering <b>manhole,</b> on the other hand, can integrate primary devices that are larger than the <b>manhole</b> barrel - with any portion that doesn't fit inside the <b>manhole</b> barrel extending upstream / downstream as necessary. Those portion that extend upstream / downstream of the barrel are manufactured with integral covers and laminated into the <b>manhole</b> structure. It is this ability to incorporate primary devices larger than the <b>manhole</b> barrel that can allow a packaged metering <b>manhole</b> to be as, or better, cost effective than a pre-cast <b>manhole</b> / vault.|$|R
50|$|For primary devices {{where the}} device (and proper transitions) can be molded into the <b>manhole</b> barrel, the unit {{cost of a}} pre-cast <b>manhole</b> is {{lower than that of}} a {{packaged}} metering <b>manhole</b> (although they lack the corrosion resistance and factory water-tightness of a packaged metering <b>manhole).</b>|$|R

Fairbairn's studies had already showed the importance of tube diameter and how small diameter tubes could easily withstand far higher pressures than large diameters. The drums could withstand the pressure by virtue of their robust construction. <b>Manholes</b> fitted to them allowed regular internal inspection.|$|E

40|$|Our work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} accurately extracting <b>manhole</b> covers, one specific type of road fixture, from a large volume of mobile {{light detection and ranging}} (LiDAR) data. We propose an efficient, step-wise <b>manhole</b> cover extraction method. First, road surface points are extracted and interpolated to generate two-dimensional geo-referenced feature (GRF) images. Next, the method segments <b>manhole</b> cover candidates by applying distance-dependent thresholding and multi-scale tensor voting to the GRF images. Finally, distance-based clustering and a morphological operation are used to extract <b>manhole</b> covers. Experiments were carried out to qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the performance of our <b>manhole</b> cover extraction method...|$|R

25|$|According {{to initial}} claims {{made by the}} railway, the {{engineer}} that left the train unattended went to the explosion zone and uncoupled the last 9 undamaged tank cars that {{were still on the}} tracks {{at the end of the}} derailment. After uncoupling the tank cars, he used a rail car mover to pull them away from the derailment site. This version of events has been disputed by Lac-Mégantic's fire chief, who indicated that a volunteer firefighter had used a rail car mover borrowed from a local factory to remove these cars from danger. It was later revealed that two employees of Tafisa (Serge Morin, Sylvain Grégoire), a firefighter (Benoît Héon), the MMA engineer (Tom Harding) and a member of the family-owned excavation company Lafontaine and Son (Pascal Lafontaine) had worked to move 9 tank cars away from the fire. Tafisa, a local particleboard industry that moves much of its product by rail, has a rail car mover which has the capability to deactivate the brakes on the cars it tows. Morin, aided by his colleague Grégoire, used the rail car mover to move the first 5 tank cars away from the fire. When they could not find a level crossing to move the rail car mover back to the disaster site, they used a loader to remove another 4 tank cars, 2 at a time. Because the loader lacked equipment to deactivate railcar brakes, Harding told the men to use the loader to break the air lines on cars to release the air brakes on each of these four cars. Lafontaine's workers hauled gravel to the site, created firebreaks and blocked <b>manholes</b> as burning oil spread into the town's storm sewer system.|$|E
500|$|Hamming {{initially}} {{wanted to}} study engineering, but money was scarce during the Great Depression, and the only scholarship offer he received came from the University of Chicago, which had no engineering school. Instead, he became a science student, majoring in mathematics, and received his Bachelor of Science degree in 1937. He later considered this a fortunate turn of events.

Also on board were 300 shipyard workers and 40 civilian employees. Watertight doors and hatches were left open for ease of access to machinery spaces, as were some <b>manholes</b> in the double and triple-bottomed hull. Abe preferred a daylight passage, since it would have allowed him extra time to train his crew and given the destroyer crews time to rest.

Shinano carried six Shinyo suicide boats, and 50 Ohka suicide flying bombs; her other aircraft were not planned to come aboard until later.
