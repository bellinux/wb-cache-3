50|$|In {{addition}} to {{making sure that}} one pays one's taxes for the year by Tax Day, {{it is also important}} to make sure that one has paid partial taxes throughout the tax year in the form of <b>estimated</b> <b>tax</b> payments of employer tax withholding. If one has not done so, then a tax penalty may be assessed. The minimum amount of <b>estimated</b> <b>taxes</b> that need to be paid to avoid penalties depends on a variety of factors, including one's income in the tax year in question as well as one's income in the previous year (in general, if one pays 90% of the current year's tax liability or 100% of the previous year's tax liability during the tax year, one is not subject to <b>estimated</b> <b>tax</b> penalty even if this year's taxes are higher, but there are some caveats to that rule). Employer withholding is also treated differently from <b>estimated</b> <b>tax</b> payment, in that for the latter, the time of the year when the payment was made matters, whereas for the former, all that matters is how much has been withheld as of the end of the year (though there are other restrictions on how one can adjust one's withholding pattern that need to be enforced by the employer).|$|R

40|$|The {{internationalisation}} {{of financial}} accounting and the European Commission's ambition to harmonise corporate taxation {{have raised the}} question whether IFRS accounts {{could be used for}} tax purposes. In order to quantify the effect of an IFRS-based taxation on corporate tax burdens in different EU member states, we <b>estimate</b> firms' <b>tax</b> equity using notes on income taxes in IFRS financial statements of companies listed in Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands. The difference between <b>estimated</b> <b>tax</b> equity and IFRS-equity, adjusted for the effect resulting from the recognition of deferred taxes, indicates the effect of using IFRS as a tax base on corporate tax burden. We find that <b>estimated</b> <b>tax</b> equity is mostly lower than IFRSequity, indicating that an IFRS-based taxation would often increase the corporate tax burden. The median of <b>estimated</b> <b>tax</b> equity is 5. 6 % (Austria), 6. 4 % (Germany) and 9. 0 % (the Netherlands) below IFRS-equity. Our results suggest that using IFRS for the determination of taxable income would often increase corporate tax burden. However, an IFRS-based taxation does not always induce higher equity as often argued in the literature. In 307 of 1. 113 totally analysed firm-years, <b>estimated</b> <b>tax</b> equity exceeds IFRS-equity. Analysing IFRS-tax differences on a balance sheet caption level, we find that the most important differences can be observed for intangibles and provisions. We find for all three analysed countries that IFRS-tax differences relating to inventories, receivables, and liabilities are typically small. We also approximate the total stock of unused tax losses and the amount of useable tax losses which can provide additional information about the management's estimates of future earnings. We find that deferred tax assets for unused tax losses are depreciated to a substantial extent, indicating that companies often assume insufficient future taxable income to utilise the total stock of tax loss carry-forwards.

30|$|We obtain {{estimates}} of effective marginal tax rates using a methodology {{similar to that}} of Mendoza et al. (1994).

Second, we account for tax progressivity by adjusting average income taxes by the ratio of the marginal income tax to the average income <b>tax</b> from an <b>estimated</b> <b>tax</b> function [following Gouveia and Strauss (1994)]. The <b>estimated</b> <b>tax</b> for the Spanish economy in the 1990 s suggests that the marginal income tax is 1.8 times the average income tax, and this is the adjustment factor that we use.
