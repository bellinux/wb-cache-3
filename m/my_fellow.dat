500|$|The win {{marked the}} second time in {{franchise}} history that the Bears won their first two games after trailing in the fourth quarter, the first being in 1971. During halftime, the team honored the 1963 Bears, two days following the death of running back Rick Casares, who was the team's leading rusher until Walter Payton surpassed him. When asked about Casares, defensive end Ed O'Bradovich stated, [...] "Oh my God, I think when you talk to <b>my</b> <b>fellow</b> teammates over here, what was all right, true and good about professional football was embodied in Rick Casares. Nobody loved the game more than him." ...|$|E
500|$|Religion was a {{paramount}} {{force in}} Romney's life. [...] In a 1959 essay for the Detroit Free Press he said, [...] "My religion is my most precious possession. ... Except for my religion, I {{easily could have}} become excessively occupied with industry, social and recreational activities. Sharing personal responsibility for church work with <b>my</b> <b>fellow</b> members has been a vital counterbalance in my life." [...] Following LDS Church practices, he did not drink alcohol or caffeinated beverages, smoke, or swear. [...] Romney and his wife tithed, and from 1955 to 1965, gave 19percent of their income {{to the church and}} another 4percent to charity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he answered, smiling, [...] "it isn't that I fancy myself {{any better}} than <b>my</b> <b>fellows.</b> I was at Magdalen, you know, under Heysey. I {{think that it was}} his {{influence}} which shaped our ideas." ...|$|R

500|$|Lucullus {{personally}} led {{the charge}} on foot and upon reaching {{the top of the}} hill, he yelled to his soldiers in an effort to buoy their morale: [...] "The day is ours, the day is ours, <b>my</b> <b>fellow</b> soldiers!" [...] With this, he gave special instructions to the cohorts to attack the horses' legs and thighs, since these were the only areas of the cataphracts which were not armored. Lucullus charged downwards along with his cohorts and his orders soon proved fatal: the lumbering cataphracts were caught by surprise and, in their attempts to break free from their attackers, careened into the ranks of their own men as the lines began to collapse.|$|E
500|$|Barry Beyerstein - [...] "One of {{the many}} enjoyable tasks I {{undertake}} for CSICOP is to lecture in Ray Hyman's annual summer workshop at the University of Oregon. [...] Not only is it the towering presence of Ray himself, and the joy of observing the sheer brainpower of <b>my</b> <b>fellow</b> faculty at work, {{it is also the}} people, literally from around the world, who enroll in this and other CSICOP functions that keep me from suffering that occupational hazard 'skeptic's burnout.' [...] They are a remarkable lot, genuinely nice people committed to critical thinking and leaving the place a bit better than they found it.

500|$|In {{the wake}} of these remarks, Nixon {{delivered}} his Silent Majority speech on November 3, 1969, calling on [...] "the great silent majority of <b>my</b> <b>fellow</b> Americans" [...] to support the administration's policy in Vietnam. The speech was well received by the public, but less so by the press, who strongly attacked Nixon's allegations that {{only a minority of}} Americans opposed the war. Nixon speechwriter Pat Buchanan penned a speech in response, to be delivered by Agnew on November 13 in Des Moines, Iowa. The White House worked to assure the maximum exposure for Agnew's speech, and the networks covered it live, making it a nationwide address, a rarity for vice presidents. According to Witcover, [...] "Agnew made the most of it".|$|E
500|$|Outside of China and the {{traditional}} [...] "Sinosphere", the Zhuangzi lags far behind the Tao Te Ching in general popularity, and is rarely known by non-scholars. A number of prominent scholars have attempted to bring the Zhuangzi to wider attention among Western readers. [...] In 1939, the British translator and Sinologist Arthur Waley described the Zhuangzi as [...] "one of the most entertaining {{as well as one}} of the profoundest books in the world." [...] In the introduction to his 1994 translation of the Zhuangzi, the American Sinologist Victor H. Mair wrote: [...] "I feel a sense of injustice that the Dao De Jing is so well known to <b>my</b> <b>fellow</b> citizens while the Zhuangzi is so thoroughly ignored, because I firmly believe that the latter is in every respect a superior work." ...|$|E
500|$|A direct {{relationship}} between the real Clyde and the fictional Winesburg, however, remains the supposition of scholars. Anderson wrote in A Writer's Conception of Realism that he reacted with [...] "shock" [...] when he [...] "...heard people {{say that one of}} my own books Winesburg, Ohio, was an exact picture of Ohio village life." [...] The author went on to admit that, [...] "the hint for almost every character was taken from <b>my</b> <b>fellow</b> lodgers in a large rooming house..." [...] These lodgers were the [...] "...young musicians, young writers, painters, actors..." [...] and others that lived in proximity to Anderson on the North Side of Chicago and to whom he referred as [...] "The Little Children of the Arts". The truth probably lies somewhere in between, with memories of Clyde [...] "merging" [...] with Anderson's interactions at the boardinghouse.|$|E
5000|$|... "Have I {{attained}} a superior human attainment, a truly noble distinction of knowledge & vision, such that - when <b>my</b> <b>fellows</b> {{in the holy}} life question me {{in the last days}} of my life - I won't feel abashed?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I tell <b>my</b> <b>fellows,</b> your Excellency, that Mundo is my title, and not my name; {{but that}} I am greater than kings, even, who are content {{to take their}} titles from a part of that, of which I bear all." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{book has}} {{eighteen}} chapters with a two-page preface, which explains {{his experience with}} Metamorphosis and how this book complements it. The thesis of this book is identified by one reviewer as: [...] "the importance of childhood's formative years {{for the development of}} the person. In Suzuki's case, it is the effects of racism, notably time spent in BC's internment camps during the Second World War, that still haunt him." [...] In an interview, Suzuki said, [...] "my drive to do well has been motivated by the desire to demonstrate to <b>my</b> <b>fellow</b> Canadians that my family and I had not deserved to be treated as we were". Suzuki identifies a turning point of his life as winning his high school's student presidential election. He initially refused to run believing he was not popular enough. His father encouraged him, saying: [...] "There's no disgrace in losing... The important thing is trying." [...] Suzuki ran and unexpectedly won with an [...] "outsider" [...] platform.|$|E
500|$|His father's last {{move was}} in 1944, back to Wapakoneta. Armstrong {{attended}} Blume High School and took flying lessons at the grassy Wapakoneta airfield. He earned a student flight certificate on his 16th birthday, then soloed later in August; all {{before he had}} a driver's license. Armstrong {{was active in the}} Boy Scouts and earned the rank of Eagle Scout. As an adult, he was recognized by the Boy Scouts of America with its Distinguished Eagle Scout Award and Silver Buffalo Award. On July 18, 1969, while flying toward the Moon inside the Columbia, Armstrong greeted the Scouts: [...] "I'd like to say hello to all <b>my</b> <b>fellow</b> Scouts and Scouters at Farragut State Park in Idaho having a National Jamboree there this week; and Apollo11 would like to send them best wishes". [...] Houston replied: [...] "Thank you, Apollo11. I'm sure that, if they didn't hear that, they'll get the word through the news. Certainly appreciate that." [...] Among the very few personal items that Neil Armstrong carried with him to the Moon and back was a World Scout Badge.|$|E
500|$|After high school, {{he enlisted}} in the United States Air Force. Stone worked at the Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, California, as an intake clerk for {{children}} who needed to be treated, and trained at United States Forces Azores. Joao Santos, a trainer of Stone, {{said that he is}} [...] "a really nice guy, polite, well-educated and very keen on learning." [...] In October 2015, Stone was promoted to the rank of senior airman at Travis Air Force Base in California, partly in due to the bold acts in France. Following this promotion, Stone was promoted to the rank of staff sergeant, effective November 1, 2016, by the order of United States Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Mark A. Welsh III. Stone commented, saying [...] "It is an honor to be promoted to staff sergeant, and I am extremely thankful for the opportunity to lead <b>my</b> <b>fellow</b> Airmen,” and that “I am ready for the growth and challenges that are ahead of me." [...] Stone was promoted in part due to his role in stopping the 2015 Thalys train attack.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I can mount you," [...] he said. [...] "Several of <b>my</b> <b>fellows</b> {{slipped into}} the town in hopes of getting some loot, and three or four were shot; so if the general will give you leave, I will take you." ...|$|R
