40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{reflector}} surface adaptation can achieve performance characteristics on the order of phase array antennas without the complexity and cost. The work proposed in this study develops a class of antennas capable of variable directivity (beam steering) and power density (beam shaping). The actuation for these antennas is employed by either polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film bonded to a metalized <b>mylar</b> <b>skin</b> or shape memory alloys (SMA) embedded in a composite structure. Theoretical studies of flexible antennas have shown that cylindrical antennas can achieve a directivity variation (beam scanning) of over 10 Â° and an increase in ground coverage of over 40 %. Tn this study, prototypes are modeled and simulated to verify results...|$|E
40|$|Two piloted {{aircraft}} {{have been developed}} and flown powered solely by photovoltaic cells in a program sponsored by the DuPont Company. The 30. 8 -kg (68 -lb), 21. 6 -m (71 -ft) span, Gossamer Penguin {{was used as a}} solar test bed, making a 2. 6 -km (1. 6 -mile) flight in August 1980. The 88. 1 -kg (194 -lb), 14. 3 -m (47 -ft) span Solar Challenger was developed for long flights in normal turbulence. Stressed to + 9 G, it utilizes Kevlar, Nomex honeycomb-graphite sandwich wall tubes, expanded polystyrene foam ribs, and <b>Mylar</b> <b>skin.</b> With a 54. 9 -kg (121 -lb) airframe, 33. 1 -kg (73 -lb) propulsion system, and a 45. 4 -kg (100 -lb) pilot, it flies on 1400 watts. In summer, the projected maximum climb is 1. 0 m/s (200 ft/min) at 9, 150 m (30, 000 ft). Sixty purely solar-powered flights were made during winter 1980 - 1981. Using thermals, 1, 070 m (3, 500 ft) was reached with 115 -minute duration...|$|E
50|$|The {{heads or}} skins used are a batter head (the playing surface {{on the top}} of the drum) and a {{resonant}} (bottom) head. The resonant head is usually much thinner than the batter head and is not beaten while playing. Rather than calfskin, most modern drums use plastic (<b>Mylar)</b> <b>skins</b> of around 10 mils thickness, sometimes with multiple plies (usually two) of around 7 mils for the batter head. In addition, tone control rings or dots can be applied, either on the outer or inner surface of the head, to control overtones and ringing, and can be found positioned in the centre or close to the edge hoops or both. Resonant heads are usually only a few mils thick, to enable them to respond to the movement of the batter head as it is played. Pipe band requirements have led to the development of a Kevlar-based head, enabling very high tuning, thus producing a very high-pitched cracking snare sound.|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{compliant}} wall {{skin friction}} test results obtained in a low-turbulence pressure tunnel are reported. Compliant surface skins consisted of 0. 0025 cm thick mylar, stretched under tension and area-bonded or longitudinally strip-bonded with silicone rubber adhesive to polyurethane foam. Mean velocity and fluctuating survey {{data were obtained}} with a single slanted hot wire. Mean velocity profiles for the area-bonded <b>mylar</b> surface <b>skins</b> indicated up to a 20 % reduction in boundary-layer thickness (and lower momentum thickness) over rigid surfaces. This reduction in boundary-layer thickness indicates that a drag reduction occurred. In addition, a 16 % reduction in wall shear was evident for the mylar/compressor foam compliant surface...|$|R
