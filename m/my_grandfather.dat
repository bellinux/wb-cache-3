And, more over, he was not so proud that he would not listen to people who had anything to say to him.|$|E

[...] At the 2011 IIHF World U18 Division I Championship, he helped France to a third-place finish, the first time the French under-18 team had ever won a medal in an IIHF tournament. His six points in five games were tied for eleventh overall in tournament scoring and tied for the lead on the French team. Bozon declined to participate in the 2012 World Junior Division IB Championships because he wanted to stay in North America and help the Blazers.|$|E
500|$|No {{one in my}} {{large family}} wrote poetry. But the first Russian woman poet, Anna Bunina, was the aunt of <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> Erasm Ivanovich Stogov. The Stogovs were modest landowners in the Mozhaisk region of the Moscow Province. They were moved here after the insurrection {{during the time of}} Posadnitsa Marfa. In Novgorod they had been a wealthier and more {{distinguished}} family. Khan Akhmat, my ancestor, was killed one night in his tent by a Russian killer-for-hire. Karamzin tells us that this marked the end of the Mongol yoke on Russia. [...] It was well known that this Akhmat was a descendant of Genghiz Khan. In the eighteenth century, one of the Akhmatov Princesses – Praskovia Yegorovna – married the rich and famous Simbirsk landowner Motovilov. Yegor Motovilov was my great-grandfather; his daughter, Anna Yegorovna, was my grandmother. She died when my mother was nine years old, and I was named in her honour. Several diamond rings and one emerald were made from her brooch. Though my fingers are thin, still her thimble didn't fit me.|$|E
500|$|The Great Dining Room is {{situated}} in the east wing extension {{of the house and}} was added in 1877 under J. MacVicar Anderson {{during the time of the}} Red Earl. The room was inspired by the ballroom of Buckingham Palace, with walls hung with faded, red damask silk. The Spencers ate their regular meals in the Tapestry Dining Room, an inner room of the east side to the east of the Wooton Hall. Aside from the two fine vividly constructed tapestries, one of gypsies and one of farming, the room is fairly bleak in design compared to other rooms in the house; the dining table is relatively small, with a drab grey floor and open brick fireplace dated in large letters to 1683. The [...] "sombre" [...] oak panelling originally came from the family's other property of Wormleighton Manor in Warwickshire. [...] Charles Spencer recalled that three generations of Spencers would eat their lunch together and that dining conditions were [...] "silent, apart from the noises of <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> eating with great gusto, a napkin tucked in around his neck, hanging down over his popping-out tummy, and it was all very sad and tense".|$|E

500|$|Levin {{was born}} in London, the second child and only son of Philip Levin, a tailor of Jewish Bessarabian descent, and his wife, Rose, née Racklin. Philip Levin {{abandoned}} the family and moved to South Africa when Levin was three. The two children were brought up {{with the help of}} their maternal grandparents, who had emigrated from Lithuania {{at the turn of the}} 20th century. Levin wrote of his childhood, [...] "My home was not a religious one; <b>my</b> <b>grandfather</b> read the scriptures to himself silently and struggled through a little English; my grandmother, who could read no language at all, lit a candle on the appropriate days, as did my mother, though for her it was not really a religious sign. My uncles were quite secular ... and had hardly anything to do with the religion of their father and grandfathers". In The Guardian after Levin's death, Quentin Crewe wrote, [...] "His illiterate grandparents' stories about life in Russia must have instilled in him the passionate belief in the freedom of the individual that lasted his whole life. In return, as he grew older, he used to read to them. Bernard could not read Hebrew, but he could get by in Yiddish".|$|E
500|$|At age six Starkey {{developed}} appendicitis. Following {{a routine}} appendectomy he contracted peritonitis, {{causing him to}} fall into a coma that lasted for days. His recovery spanned twelve months, which he spent away from his family at Liverpool's Myrtle Street children's hospital. Upon his discharge in May 1948, his mother allowed him to stay home, causing him to miss school. At age eight, he remained illiterate, with a poor grasp of mathematics. His lack of education contributed to a feeling of alienation at school, which resulted in his regularly playing truant at Sefton Park. After several years of twice-weekly tutoring from his surrogate sister and neighbour, Marie Maguire Crawford, Starkey had nearly caught up to his peers academically, but in 1953, he contracted tuberculosis and was admitted to a sanatorium, where he remained for two years. During his stay the medical staff {{made an effort to}} stimulate motor activity and relieve boredom by encouraging their patients to join the hospital band, leading to his first exposure to a percussion instrument: a makeshift mallet made from a cotton bobbin that he used to strike the cabinets next to his bed. Soon afterwards, he grew increasingly interested in drumming, receiving a copy of the Alyn Ainsworth song [...] "Bedtime for Drums" [...] as a convalescence gift from Crawford. Starkey commented: [...] "I was in the hospital band ... That's where I really started playing. I never wanted anything else from there on ... My grandparents gave me a mandolin and a banjo, but I didn't want them. <b>My</b> <b>grandfather</b> gave me a harmonica ... we had a piano – nothing. Only the drums." ...|$|E
