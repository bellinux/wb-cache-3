40|$|Abstract—Spatial <b>multizone</b> soundfield {{reproduction}} over {{an extended}} region of open space is a complex and challenging problem in acoustic signal processing. In this paper, we provide a framework to recreate 2 -D spatial <b>multizone</b> soundfields using a single array of loudspeakers which encompasses all spatial regions of interest. The reproduction {{is based on the}} derivation of an equivalent global soundfield consisting of a number of individual <b>multizone</b> soundfields. This is achieved by using spatial harmonic coefficients translation between coordinate systems. A <b>multizone</b> soundfield reproduction problem is then reduced to the reproduction over the entire region. An important advantage of this approach is the full use of the available dimensionality of the soundfield. This paper provides quantitative performances of a 2 -D <b>multizone</b> system and reveals some fundamental limits on 2 -D <b>multizone</b> soundfield reproduction. The extensions of the <b>multizone</b> soundfield reproduction design in reverberant rooms are also included.

40|$|It is {{desirable}} for people sharing a physical space to access different multimedia information streams simultaneously. For a good user experience, the interference {{of the different}} streams should be held to a minimum. This is straightforward for the video component but currently difficult for the audio sound component. Spatial <b>multizone</b> soundfield reproduction, which aims to provide an individual sound environment to each {{of a set of}} listeners without the use of physical isolation or headphones, has drawn significant attention of researchers in recent years. The realization of <b>multizone</b> soundfield reproduction is a conceptually challenging problem as currently most of the soundfield reproduction techniques concentrate on a single zone. This thesis considers the theory and design of a <b>multizone</b> soundfield reproduction system using arrays of loudspeakers in given complex environments. We first introduce a novel method for spatial <b>multizone</b> soundfield reproduction based on describing the desired <b>multizone</b> soundfield as an orthogonal expansion of formulated basis functions over the desired reproduction region. This provides the theoretical basis of both 2 -D (height invariant) and 3 -D soundfield reproduction for this work. We then extend the reproduction of the <b>multizone</b> soundfield over the desired region to reverberant environments, which is based on the identification of the acoustic transfer function (ATF) from the loudspeaker over the desired reproduction region using sparse methods. The simulation results confirm that the method leads to a significantly reduced number of required microphones for an accurate <b>multizone</b> sound reproduction compared with the state of the art, while it also facilitates the reproduction over a wide frequency range. In addition, we focus on the improvements of the proposed <b>multizone</b> reproduction system with regard to practical implementation. The so-called 2. 5 D <b>multizone</b> oundfield reproduction is considered to accurately reproduce the desired <b>multizone</b> soundfield over a selected 2 -D plane at the height approximately level with the listener’s ears using a single array of loudspeakers with 3 -D reverberant settings. Then, we propose an adaptive reverberation cancelation method for the <b>multizone</b> soundfield reproduction within the desired region and simplify the prior soundfield measurement process. Simulation results suggest that the proposed method provides a faster convergence rate than the comparative approaches under the same hardware provision. Finally, we conduct the real-world implementation based on the proposed theoretical work. The experimental results show that we can achieve a very noticeable acoustic energy contrast between the signals recorded in the bright zone and the quiet zone, especially for the system implementation with reverberation equalization...|$|E

The thermal behavior of the furnace was measured and characterized. Limitations due to both thermal and electronic (computer) factors are identified. The results indicate that the <b>multizone</b> design is limited to low temperature gradients because of the indirect furnace-to-sample thermal coupling needed to blend the discrete thermal zones. The <b>multizone</b> furnace design inherently consumes more power than a similar (two temperature) conventional Bridgman type directional solidification furnace because every zone must be capable of the high cooling rates needed to produce the maximum desired temperature drop.

The <b>multizone</b> model was used to analyze three operating conditions, i. e., a zero load point (BMEP = 0 bar at 1000 rpm), a medium load point (BMEP = 5 bar at 2000 rpm) and a medium-high load point (BMEP = 10 bar at 2000 rpm).

40|$|In the United States today, most {{residential}} {{heating systems}} are single zone. This {{means that all}} rooms must be either conditioned or not, which often leads to large unoccupied areas being conditioned to satisfy comfort needs in the occupied zones. Furthermore, these systems typically have only one sensor, which is often not representative of all zones. It would be desirable to have better control, but <b>multizone</b> systems are expensive and invasive to install if one wants to retrofit an existing residential single zone heating system into a <b>multizone</b> system. A new <b>multizone</b> system is currently being developed at UC Berkeley to provide an inexpensive, simple retrofit strategy. This consists of a wireless vent register control system. The new registers have been fitted with a mote (a small wireless device) that can send and receive signals in order to open and close vents in a house, allowing the system to only condition the desired zones. Motes fitted with temperature sensors are also placed in the zones and outside to provide additional temperature readings to the control system. Therefore, the house can take on properties of a <b>multizone</b> system by only changing the registers. The goal of the overall project is to design a simple, inexpensive system that can save energy while providing thermal comfort comparable to or better {{than that of a}} traditional single zone system. Since smaller volumes will be conditioned at a time, the heating system can potentially reach setpoint quicker, therefore running for a shorter period of time. The new system has been tested using a 1988 house in Danville, CA. This test was to verify that the system works as expected and whether target zones reach setpoint faster. While <b>multizone</b> systems can conceptually allow the user to fine-tune conditioning needs, the control algorithms will be more complicated. A single zone system only needs to actuate heating, cooling, and fan modes with one setpoint at a time. With the wireless vent control, the system must track which zones need to be conditioned and choose an appropriate vent configuration, in addition to the control needs of the single zone system. To optimize this system in a real house would be prohibitively complicated and time consuming. Therefore, an optimization model has been developed to determine optimal control sequences based on setpoint and occupancy. This optimization models the actual house, using real house data such as insulation values, flow rates, and fan power. It automates the choice of optimal configuration, rather than completing thousands and thousands of runs in real time in the actual house. The Background section of this thesis will provide an overview of existing residential heating options. Specifically, it outlines the research that has been done on the effectiveness of existing <b>multizone</b> control strategies. It will also describe the new <b>multizone</b> system being developed in the UC Berkeley Demand Response Enabling Technology group. This system provides wireless control of vent registers.

In order to promote computational efficiency, some <b>multizone</b> simulation programs, such as COMIS and CONTAM, restrict the form that their flow models may take. While these tools allow scientists and engineers to explore a wide range of building airflow problems, increasingly their use has led to new questions not answerable by the current generation of programs. This paper, directed at software developers working on the next generation of building airflow models, identifies structural aspects of COMIS and related programs that prevent them from easily incorporating desirable new airflow models. The paper also suggests criteria for evaluating alternate simulation environments for future modeling efforts...|$|E
