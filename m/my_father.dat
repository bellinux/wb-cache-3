5|$|That rebellious {{attitude}} really came, I think, when <b>my</b> <b>father</b> remarried. Because for {{the three}} years before he married, I clung to him. It was like, OK, now you're mine, and you're not going anywhere. Like all young girls, I {{was in love with}} <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and I didn't want to lose him. I lost my mother, but then I was the mother, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> was mine. Then he got taken away from me when he married my stepmother. It was then that I said, OK I don’t need anybody. No one's going to break my heart again. I'm not going to need anybody. I can stand on my own and be my own person and not belong to anyone.|$|E

In 2004 he was chosen to deliver the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention.

5|$|As Jolie {{preferred}} to dedicate {{herself to her}} humanitarian work, her cinematic output remained infrequent. First They Killed <b>My</b> <b>Father</b> (2017), a drama set during Cambodia's Khmer Rouge era, again enabled her to combine both interests. In addition to directing the film, she co-wrote the screenplay with her longtime friend Loung Ung, whose memoirs about the regime's child labor camps served as its source material. Intended primarily for a Cambodian audience, the film was produced directly for Netflix, which allowed {{for the use of}} an exclusively Khmer cast and script. Jolie is next contracted to reprise the role of Maleficent in Disney's sequel.|$|E
