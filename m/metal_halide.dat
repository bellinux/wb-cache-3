5|$|Lithium {{fluoride}} is {{the only}} alkali <b>metal</b> <b>halide</b> that is poorly soluble in water, and lithium hydroxide {{is the only}} alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent. Conversely, lithium perchlorate and other lithium salts with large anions that cannot be polarised are much more stable than the analogous compounds of the other alkali metals, probably because Li+ has a high solvation energy. This effect also means that most simple lithium salts are commonly encountered in hydrated form, because the anhydrous forms are extremely hygroscopic: this allows salts like lithium chloride and lithium bromide {{to be used in}} dehumidifiers and air-conditioners.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} also react {{similarly}} with hydrogen to form ionic alkali metal hydrides, where the hydride anion {{acts as a}} pseudohalide: these are often used as reducing agents, producing hydrides, complex metal hydrides, or hydrogen gas. Other pseudohalides are also known, notably the cyanides. These are isostructural to the respective halides except for lithium cyanide, indicating that the cyanide ions may rotate freely. Ternary alkali <b>metal</b> <b>halide</b> oxides, such as Na3ClO, K3BrO (yellow), Na4Br2O, Na4I2O, and K4Br2O, are also known. The polyhalides are rather unstable, although those of rubidium and caesium are greatly stabilised by the feeble polarising power of these extremely large cations.|$|E
5|$|In {{its natural}} habitat, N. rajah grows in open areas, {{where it is}} exposed to direct {{sunlight}} – it therefore needs to be provided with {{a significant amount of}} light in cultivation as well. To meet this need, many growers have used <b>metal</b> <b>halide</b> lamps in the 500–1000watt range, with considerable success. The plant should be situated a fair distance from the light source, 1 to 2 m is recommended. Depending on location, growers can utilise natural sunlight as a source of illumination. However, this is only recommended for those living in equatorial regions, where light intensity is sufficient to satisfy the needs of the plant. A photoperiod of 12hours is comparable to that experienced in nature, since Borneo lies on the equator.|$|E
5000|$|Polymeric <b>metal</b> <b>halides</b> {{generally}} have melting and boiling points that {{are higher than}} monomeric <b>metal</b> <b>halides,</b> but lower than ionic <b>metal</b> <b>halides.</b> They are soluble only {{in the presence of}} a ligand which liberates discrete units. For example, palladium chloride is quite insoluble in water, but it dissolves well in concentrated sodium chloride solution: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>halides</b> are {{compounds}} between {{metals and}} halogens. Some, such as sodium chloride are ionic, {{while others are}} covalently bonded. Covalently bonded <b>metal</b> <b>halides</b> may be discrete molecules, such as uranium hexafluoride, or they may form polymeric structures, such as palladium chloride.|$|R
50|$|Thallium(I) {{can form}} {{complexes}} {{of the type}} (TlX3)2− and (TlX4)3− both in solution and when thallium(I) halides are incorporated into alkali <b>metal</b> <b>halides.</b> These doped alkali <b>metal</b> <b>halides</b> have new absorption and emission nbands and are used as phosphors in scintillation radiation detectors.|$|R
5|$|The Tranquebar Association, {{formed in}} 2001, {{with the help}} of the Tamil Nadu State Archaeological Department and the Danish Royal family, {{restored}} the South end of the fort with the same kind of material like brick and black stone, used during the original construction. The renovation was completed in 2005, with contributions from local artisans, Danish volunteers, Danish and Indian experts. In 2001, chemists from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) restored the portrait of Raja Ragunatha Naik, Tranquebar site map, pottery, portrait of Christian IV, the Danish King. <b>Metal</b> <b>Halide</b> lamps, which provide a uniform green-coloured lighting, were used for illuminating the exteriors. The restored complex was opened by the Collector of the Nagapattinam District in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Unveiled in 1989, the new {{lighting}} arrangement {{required the}} removal of the contour-outlining light bulbs and the installation of 176floodlights in and around the tower's frame. From dusk to midnight, the floodlights illuminate the entire tower. Sodium vapor lamps are used from 2 October to 6 July to cover the tower in an orange color. From 7 July to 1 October, the lights are changed to <b>metal</b> <b>halide</b> lamps to illuminate the tower with a white color. The reasoning behind the change is a seasonal one. Ishii reasoned that orange is a warmer color and helps to offset the cold winter months. Conversely, white is thought a cool color that helps during the hot summer months.|$|E
25|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>halide</b> {{lights are}} {{generally}} the highest output lighting commercially available. They produce about 90-100 {{lumens per watt}} of power. This is roughly the same as fluorescent. The improvement with metal halides is that they concentrate this light output into a very small space, whereas fluorescent lights evenly illuminate the entire aquarium. This {{is often referred to}} as point source lighting, and is what causes the rippling visual effect on many advanced aquarium setups. This concentration of light output increases the intensity, allowing <b>metal</b> <b>halide</b> lamps to penetrate light to even the very bottom levels of most aquariums. Metal halides are available in many color temperatures, from 6500 K up to 20,000 K, though bulbs as high as 50,000 K are occasionally found. The downsides of <b>metal</b> <b>halide</b> lighting are the initial cost and the heat produced.|$|E
50|$|Metal {{fluorides}} have similarities {{with other}} <b>metal</b> <b>halides</b> but are more ionic. In many respects, metal fluorides differ from other <b>metal</b> <b>halides</b> (chlorides, bromides, iodides), {{very similar to}} each other. Instead, fluorides are more similar to oxides, often having similar bonding and crystal structures.|$|R

25|$|Starting on July 4, 2000, and for {{subsequent}} special occasions, each tower is illuminated by 380 light fixtures that highlight the exposed steel structure.

25|$|Air driven, {{counter-current}} protein skimmers {{and reliable}} submersible electric heaters were invented in Germany. Various advances in filtration included trickle and hang-on filters, both allowing {{a more natural}} equilibrium in the aquarium environment. The advancement of fluorescent lighting technologies to provide higher output, along with <b>metal</b> <b>halide</b> lighting, enabled the first reef tanks, {{making it possible to}} keep corals and other invertebrates without natural sunlight.|$|E
25|$|Most <b>metal</b> <b>halide</b> {{fixtures}} {{are more}} expensive than fluorescent systems, but are required for some reef setups. Halide lamps concentrate heat as well as light output. The surface of an operating lamp becomes hot enough to cause second or third degree burns instantly, so this lighting technology must be used with caution. The heat produced can also warm the aquarium to unacceptable levels, possibly necessitating {{the use of a}} chiller for certain aquarium setups.|$|E
25|$|T-5 HO {{lights are}} the newest {{variation}} on fluorescent lights. They are run at slightly higher power levels than standard fluorescent lamps, but are made significantly thinner than standard fluorescent bulbs, {{which allows for}} more efficient reflector designs that get more light into the aquarium. Higher quality T-5 systems often match or exceed the output of equivalent power compact fluorescent or VHO lighting fixtures. On the downside, T-5 lighting {{is the most expensive}} type fluorescent lighting available. Many times it is much cheaper per watt, especially in the long run with the multiple T-5 bulbs being replaced, to use an equivalent <b>metal</b> <b>halide</b> light setup over a T-5 setup if such high light output is required.|$|E

25|$|Regular {{cyclical}} {{lighting is}} used in aquariums to simulate day and night. This is beneficial for fish and invertebrates since it establishes a routine, enables them to rest, and makes them feel more secure. Aside from establishing a routine, high output lighting is required for many invertebrates such as corals and anemones to survive. Lighting in marine tanks that contain only fish and live rock is not an important issue. In aquariums containing invertebrates, however, where algal growth (of both free-living and symbiotic algae) is desired, more intense lighting is required. Various light sources include {{but are not limited}} to: natural sunlight, fluorescent, VHO fluorescent (Very High Output), T-5 fluorescent, compact fluorescent, LED and <b>metal</b> <b>halide.</b> Each type of lighting has its own advantages and disadvantages. They all vary in initial cost, maintenance cost, spectrum obtainable, longevity, efficiency, and power.|$|E
25|$|During 2012, the building's {{four hundred}} <b>metal</b> <b>halide</b> lamps and {{floodlights}} were replaced with 1,200 LED fixtures, increasing the available colors from nine to over 16 million. The computer-controlled system allows {{the building to}} be illuminated {{in ways that were}} unable to be done previously with plastic gels. For instance, on November 6, 2012, CNN used the top of the Empire State Building as a scoreboard for the 2012 United States presidential election. When incumbent president Barack Obama had reached the 270 electoral votes necessary to win re-election, the lights turned blue. Had Republican challenger Mitt Romney won, the building would have been lit red. Also, on November 26, 2012, the building had its first ever synchronized light show, using music from recording artist Alicia Keys. The building's owners adhere to strict standards in using the lights; for instance, they would not use the lights to play advertisements.|$|E

500|$|Given {{the large}} {{size of the}} iodide anion and iodine's weak {{oxidising}} power, high oxidation states are difficult to achieve in binary iodides, the maximum known being in the pentaiodides of niobium, tantalum, and protactinium. Iodides {{can be made by}} reaction of an element or its oxide, hydroxide, or carbonate with hydroiodic acid, and then dehydrated by mildly high temperatures combined with either low pressure or anhydrous hydrogen iodide gas. These methods work best when the iodide product is stable to hydrolysis; otherwise, the possibilities include high-temperature oxidative iodination of the element with iodine or hydrogen iodide, high-temperature iodination of a metal oxide or other halide by iodine, a volatile <b>metal</b> <b>halide,</b> carbon tetraiodide, or an organic iodide. For example, molybdenum(IV) oxide reacts with aluminium(III) iodide at 230°C to give molybdenum(II) iodide.
