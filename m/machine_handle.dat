40|$|Introduction One of {{the most}} {{important}} problems arising with operation of the conventional rototillers is severe vibration of the <b>machine</b> <b>handle</b> which is transmitted to the user’s hands, arms and shoulders. Long period exposure of the hand-transmitted vibration may cause various diseases such as white finger syndrome. Therefore in this study, vibrations of a new type of rototiller with ridged blades were investigated at the position of handle/hand interface in different working conditions. Finally, the maximum allowable exposure time to the rototiller users in continuous tillage operation was obtained according to ISO 5349 - 1. Materials and Methods Experiments were carried out in one of the farms with silty clay soil texture, located in Sari city, Mazandaran province, Iran. Vibration measurements were performed according to ISO 5349 - 1 and ISO 5349 - 2 standards in two different modes, including in situ mode and tillage mode. Vibrational parameters were obtained in three blade rotational speeds, i. e., low speed (140 - 170 rpm), medium speed (170 - 200), and high speed (200 - 230). Blade rotational speed varied by changing engine speed using the throttle control lever. In each experiment, different vibrational values were individually recorded in three directions (x, y, and z). Experimental design and data analysis were performed in a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications using the SPSS 16 software. Results and Discussion Based on the obtained results in this study, the RMS of acceleration increased by increasing in rotational speed for all of the conducted experiments. The reason is that number of cutting per unit of time and consequently the frequency of changing in the dynamic forces exerting on the blades dramatically increases with increasing the rotational speed of the blades. Noteworthy is that in most cases the variation of acceleration in the tillage mode showed similar trend with vibrational values in the idling mode. This represents a significant contribution of the combustion engine in vibration of the examined rototiller. Meanwhile, contribution of the engine in the total measured vibration was more than 50...|$|E

40|$|Abstract { One of the {{essential}} problems in parallel computing is: can SIMD <b>machines</b> <b>handle</b> asynchronous problems? This is a di cult, unsolved problem because of the mismatch between asynchronous problems and SIMD architectures. We propose a solution to let SIMD <b>machines</b> <b>handle</b> general asynchronous problems. Our approach is to implement a runtime support system which can run MIMD-like software on SIMD hardware. The runtime support system, named P kernel, is thread-based. There are two major advantages of the thread-based model. First, for application problems with irregular and/or unpredictable features, automatic scheduling can move some threads from overloaded processors to underloaded processors. Second, and more importantly, the granularity of threads can be controlled to reduce system overhead. The P kernel is also able to handle bookkeeping and message management, {{as well as to}} make these low-level tasks transparent to users. Substantial performance has been obtained on Maspar MP- 1. ...|$|R
