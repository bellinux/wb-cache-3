5|$|The {{contract}} for Metro's fare collection system was awarded in 1975 to Cubic Transportation Systems. Electronic fare collection using paper <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe</b> cards started on July 1, 1977, {{a little more}} than a year after the first stations opened. Prior to electronic fare collection, exact change fareboxes were used. Metro's historic paper farecard system is also shared by Bay Area Rapid Transit, which Cubic won a {{contract for}} in 1974. Any remaining value stored on the paper cards was printed on the card at each exit, and passes were printed with the expiration date.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo GameCube memory cards, {{on which}} saved games are kept, can be {{inserted}} into these arcade units. A memory card {{is required for}} players {{a chance to win}} the AX-exclusive pilots, their vehicles, and tracks for use in GX. Players can store up to four machines from GX on a memory card, then play them in AX. If a memory card is used with a <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe</b> card, players have additional options; they can enter stored GX machines into the F-Zero AX Internet ranking system, and transfer custom AX machine parts to GX. F-Zero AX content is also unlockable by progressing through GXs tougher challenges. It was discovered in early 2013 that the arcade version is playable within the GameCube version by the use of a cheat cartridge.|$|E
25|$|A <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe</b> card {{is a type}} of card {{capable of}} storing data by modifying the {{magnetism}} of tiny iron-based magnetic particles on a band of magnetic material on the card. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe,</b> sometimes called a magstripe, is read by physical contact and swiping past a reading head. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>stripe</b> cards are commonly used in credit cards, identity cards such as a driver's license, and transportation tickets. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe</b> card was invented in 1960 by IBM engineer Forrest Parry, who conceived the idea of incorporating a piece of magnetic tape in order to store secured information and data to a plastic card base.|$|E

50|$|New fareboxes were {{installed}} in June 2011. The fareboxes collect fares, issue new <b>magnetic</b> <b>striped</b> tickets (e.g., day passes, change cards) and process previously issued <b>magnetic</b> <b>striped</b> tickets (e.g., day passes, youth summer passes, change cards). When a patron {{does not have}} exact change, a change card is issued with a cash value that can be redeemed at a future farebox transaction {{for up to a}} year.|$|R
25|$|RFID tags {{are widely}} used in {{identification}} badges, replacing earlier <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe</b> cards. These badges need only be held within a certain distance of the reader to authenticate the holder. Tags can also be placed on vehicles, which can be read at a distance, to allow entrance to controlled areas without having to stop the vehicle and present a card or enter an access code.|$|E
25|$|The MetroCard {{does have}} a <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe,</b> but both the track offsets and the {{encoding}} differ from standard Magstripe cards. It is a proprietary format developed by the contractor Cubic. Off-the-shelf reader/writers for the standard cards are useless, and even hypothetically could work only with both physical and software modification. Some have had partial success decoding it using audio tape recorder heads, laptop sound cards, and custom Linux software.|$|E
25|$|The {{automated}} fare collection {{equipment is}} also compatible with the MBTA's CharlieTicket, a paper card with a <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe</b> that operates as a stored-value card or time-period (monthly, weekly, or daily) pass. The MBTA first implemented the stored-value CharlieTicket on the Silver Line in February 2005. The ticket is inserted into a slot in the gate or farebox, the fare is deducted, and the remaining balance is displayed on a small screen. The ticket is {{then returned to the}} rider even if there is no remaining value.|$|E

25|$|Electronic {{verification}} systems allow merchants {{to verify}} {{in a few}} seconds that the card is valid and the cardholder has sufficient credit to cover the purchase, allowing the verification to happen at time of purchase. The verification is performed using a credit card payment terminal or point-of-sale (POS) system with a communications link to the merchant's acquiring bank. Data from the card is obtained from a <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe</b> or chip on the card; the latter system is called Chip and PIN in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and is implemented as an EMV card.|$|E
25|$|IBM {{manufactures}} {{and markets}} computers hardware, middleware and software, and offers hosting and consulting services in areas ranging from mainframe computers to nanotechnology. IBM {{is also a}} major research organization, holding the record for most patents generated by a business (as of 2017) for 24 consecutive years. Inventions by IBM include the automated teller machine (ATM), the PC, the floppy disk, the hard disk drive, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe</b> card, the relational database, the SQL programming language, the UPC barcode, and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). The IBM mainframe, exemplified by the System/360, was the dominant computing platform during the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E
25|$|The older blue MetroCards {{were not}} capable of the many kinds of fare options that the gold ones {{currently}} offer. The format of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe</b> used by the blue MetroCard offered very little other than the standard pay-per-swipe fare. Also, gold MetroCards allow groups of people (up to four) to ride together using a single pay-per-swipe MetroCard. The gold MetroCard keeps track {{of the number of}} swipes at a location in order to allow those same number of people to transfer at a subsequent location, if applicable. The MetroCard system was designed to ensure backward compatibility, which allowed a smooth transition from the blue format to gold.|$|E

25|$|Metcard {{tickets were}} credit-card in size which contain a <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe,</b> {{and had to}} be {{inserted}} in a validator before each use. Only the busier stations have ticket-operated barrier gates. At other stations enforcement is based on honesty, with random checks. Metcards used to be available from machines at all stations, but those have recently been removed as part of the conversion to Myki. Metcards are also no longer available from machines on trams, from station ticket offices at staffed stations and from bus drivers as of 29 December 2012. As Metcards had to be validated before use (except when bought on trams, which were sold pre-validated), they had to be bought in advance and used when required.|$|E
25|$|Various {{types of}} {{quantitative}} and semi-quantitative information {{are available to}} constrain past plate motions. The geometric fit between continents, such as between west Africa and South America is still {{an important part of}} plate reconstruction. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>stripe</b> patterns provide a reliable guide to relative plate motions going back into the Jurassic period. The tracks of hotspots give absolute reconstructions, but these are only available back to the Cretaceous. Older reconstructions rely mainly on paleomagnetic pole data, although these only constrain the latitude and rotation, but not the longitude. Combining poles of different ages in a particular plate to produce apparent polar wander paths provides a method for comparing the motions of different plates through time. Additional evidence comes from the distribution of certain sedimentary rock types, faunal provinces shown by particular fossil groups, and the position of orogenic belts.|$|E
25|$|Famous inventions and {{developments}} by IBM include: the Automated teller machine (ATM), Dynamic {{random access}} memory (DRAM), the electronic keypunch, the financial swap, the floppy disk, the hard disk drive, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe</b> card, the relational database, RISC, the SABRE airline reservation system, SQL, the Universal Product Code (UPC) bar code, and the virtual machine. Additionally, in 1990 company scientists used a scanning tunneling microscope to arrange 35 individual xenon atoms to spell out the company acronym, marking the first structure assembled one atom at a time. A major part of IBM research is the generation of patents. Since its first patent for a traffic signaling device, IBM {{has been one of}} the world's most prolific patent sources. In 2017, the company holds the record for most patents generated by a business, marking 24 consecutive years for the achievement.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, Interac {{announced}} it will be moving to EMV Chip Card technology. The main benefit to this technology over the existing <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripes</b> is that the chips are almost impossible to copy due {{to high levels of}} encryption.|$|R

50|$|The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) {{discovered}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripes</b> in {{the crust}} of Mars, {{especially in the}} Phaethontis and Eridania quadrangles (Terra Cimmeria and Terra Sirenum). The magnetometer on MGS discovered 100 km wide stripes of magnetized crust running roughly parallel for up to 2000 km. These stripes alternate in polarity with the north magnetic pole of one pointing up from the surface and the north magnetic pole of the next pointing down. When similar stripes were discovered on Earth in the 1960s, they were taken as evidence of plate tectonics. Researchers believe these <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripes</b> on Mars are evidence for a short, early period of plate tectonic activity. When the rocks became solid they retained the magnetism that existed at the time. A magnetic field of a planet {{is believed to be}} caused by fluid motions under the surface. However, there are some differences, between the <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripes</b> on Earth and those on Mars. The Martian stripes are wider, much more strongly magnetized, and do not appear to spread out from a middle crustal spreading zone. Because the area containing the <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripes</b> is about 4 billion years old, it is believed that the global magnetic field probably lasted for only the first few hundred million years of Mars' life, when the temperature of the molten iron in the planet's core might have been high enough to mix it into a magnetic dynamo. There are no magnetic fields near large impact basins like Hellas. The shock of the impact may have erased the remnant magnetization in the rock. So, magnetism produced by early fluid motion in the core would not have existed after the impacts.|$|R
25|$|Travelcards {{for seven}} days or longer are known as season tickets and allow travel {{at any time of}} the day. When bought at a London Underground station or other Transport for London agent, one day Travelcards are sold on a paper ticket with a <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe</b> and Travelcards lasting seven days or more are loaded on to an Oyster Card. A monthly travelcard (valid for between 28 and 31 days {{depending}} on month) is sold for 3.84 times the price of a 7-day card, while annual travelcards are sold for the price of 40 7-day tickets. The price of a travelcard valid for between one month and one year will be the sum of the relevant number of months, plus a pro-rata monthly rate for the number of days in the final month. As 40 weekly tickets cost approximately the same as a 10-month-12-day ticket, it is not possible in practice to buy a travelcard for a period between 10M12D and 1 year, as an annual pass is cheaper and will be issued anyway.|$|E
25|$|The Travelcard is an inter-modal travel {{ticket for}} {{unlimited}} {{use on the}} London Underground, London Overground, TfL Rail, Docklands Light Railway, Tramlink, London Buses and National Rail services in the Greater London area. Travelcards can be purchased {{for a period of}} time varying from one day to a year, from Transport for London, National Rail and their agents. Depending on where it is purchased, and the length of validity, a Travelcard is either printed on a paper ticket with a <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe</b> or encoded onto an Oyster card, Transport for London's contactless electronic smart card. The cost of a Travelcard is determined by the area it covers and, for this purpose, London is divided into a number of fare zones. The Travelcard season ticket for unlimited travel on London Buses and the London Underground was launched on 22 May 1983 by London Transport. One Day Travelcards and validity on other transport modes were added from 1984 onwards. The introduction of the Travelcard caused an increase in patronage and reduced the number of tickets that needed to be purchased by passengers.|$|E
500|$|F-Zero AX {{cabinets}} can dispense <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe</b> cards {{called a}} [...] "F-Zero license card" [...] {{to keep track}} of custom machine data, pilot points, and race data. A card was bundled with the Japanese release of F-Zero GX. The card expires after fifty uses, but its data can be transferred to a new card. Once inserted, the game builds a machine with three custom parts which can be upgraded by earning pilot points. Pilot points are acquired as the player progresses through the Race and Time Attack modes. Players can increase point earnings by improving finish place, eliminating opponents, and finishing races with a large amount of energy reserved. A <b>magnetic</b> <b>stripe</b> card is needed to enter the F-Zero AX Internet Ranking system. Similarly to GX, players receive a password after completing a Time Attack race to enter on the official F-Zero website's ranking system.|$|E

50|$|As {{many areas}} of the ocean floor, {{particularly}} the Atlantic Ocean, are currently inactive, {{it can be difficult to}} determine past plate motion. However, by observing the fracture zones, one can determine both the direction and rate of past plate motion. This is found by observing the patterns of <b>magnetic</b> <b>striping</b> on the ocean floor (a result of the reversals of Earth's magnetic field over time). By measuring the offset in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>striping,</b> one can then determine the rate of past plate motions. In a similar method, one can use the relative ages of the seafloor on either side of a fracture zone to determine the rate of past plate motions. By comparing how offset similarly aged seafloor is, one can determine how quickly the plate has moved.|$|R
