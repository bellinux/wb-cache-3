50|$|A <b>mulching</b> <b>blade,</b> {{also known}} as an {{all-purpose}} blade, features a curved surface which allows it to work in three ways: lifting, mowing, and mulching. First, the blade pulls the grass up and cuts it. Then, clippings are sucked inside the deck and are chopped into tinier pieces. Finally, the bladeâ€™s innermost curve produces air pressure to blow the small clippings out, where {{they are used to}} feed the soil.|$|E
50|$|The {{first known}} lawn mower sported a {{cylinder}} cutting gear made of iron. It {{was used to}} mow sporting grounds and wide-ranging gardens. As manufacturers changed the design and structure of mowers, the cutting mechanism also developed and evolved into several varieties, including cylinder/reel <b>blades,</b> deck <b>blades,</b> <b>mulching</b> <b>blades,</b> and lifting blades.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mulching</b> mowersSpecial <b>mulching</b> <b>blades</b> are {{available}} for rotary mowers. The blade is designed to keep the clippings circulating underneath the mower until the clippings are chopped quite small. Other designs have twin <b>blades</b> to <b>mulch</b> the clippings to small pieces. This function has the advantages of forgoing the additional work collecting and disposing grass clippings while reducing lawn waste {{in such a way}} that also creates convenient compost for the lawn, forgoing the expense and adverse environmental effect of fertilizer.|$|R
