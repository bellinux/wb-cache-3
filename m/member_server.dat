For evaluating the performance of F 5 content switch, some experimental tests has been taken on implemented scenarios using RR and Ratio model load balancing algorithms.

We argue that prior evidence has failed to control for innate characteristics that reflect the firm’s business and operating environment (Francis et al., 2005). To address this issue, we decompose accruals quality into two components, innate and discretionary accruals. This allows us to investigate the relationship between family ownership and discretionary accruals in specific. We show that family ownership is associated with higher quality of discretionary accruals. Furthermore, we find that the association is marginally stronger when a family <b>member</b> <b>servers</b> as the chief executive officer. Our results consider other governance mechanisms that have been shown to impact discretionary accruals in prior studies...|$|R

Global catalog (GC) servers provide a global listing of all objects in the Forest.Global Catalog servers replicate to themselves all objects from all domains and hence, provide a global listing of objects in the forest. However, to minimize replication traffic and keep the GC's database small, only selected attributes of each object are replicated. This is called the partial attribute set (PAS). The PAS can be modified by modifying the schema and marking attributes for replication to the GC. Earlier versions of Windows used NetBIOS to communicate. Active Directory is fully integrated with DNS and requires TCP/IP—DNS. To be fully functional, the DNS server must support SRV resource records, also known as service records.|$|R
40|$|The PageRank {{algorithm}} {{demonstrates the}} significance of the computation of document ranking of general importance or authority in Web information retrieval. However, doing a PageRank computation for the whole Web graph is both time-consuming and costly. State of the art Web crawler based search engines also suffer from the latency in retrieving a complete Web graph for the computation of PageRank. We look into the problem of computing PageRank in a decentralized and timely fashion by making use of SiteRank and aggregating rankings from multiple sites. A SiteRank is basically the ranking generated by applying the classical PageRank algorithm to the graph of Web sites, i. e., the Web graph at the granularity of Web sites instead of Web pages. Our empirical results show that SiteRank also follows a power-law distribution. Our experimental results demonstrate that the decomposition of global Web document ranking computation by making use of SiteRank is a very promising approach for computing global document rankings in a decentralized Web search system. In particular, by sharing SiteRank among <b>member</b> <b>servers,</b> such a search system also obtains a new means to fight link spamming...|$|R

40|$|We {{find that}} there lacks a formal {{algebraic}} framework in the research area of P 2 P information retrieval. Such a formal framework is indispensable and pivotal. On the one hand, no solid theoretical foundation can explain why the results of many ad-hoc commercial ranking algorithms are good or bad; on the other hand, in some cases, it might be preferable in a decentralized search system to use different retrieval models and different ranking algorithms {{at the same time}} since each separate document collection and each peer might have different characteristics. Thus {{it is important to have}} a common framework, where we can capture the individual models and describe the overall behavior. Such a framework characterizes notions like ranking, relevance feedback, rank aggregation and combination, etc. and necessary operations. In this paper, we define such a foundation model for P 2 P information retrieval, where data models for rankings from the perspectives of both the end user's search needs and the search <b>member</b> <b>server's</b> contextual rankings are provided, and a new ranking aggregation language is proposed to perform ranking combination operations. A case study is included to demonstrate how the foundation model and the ranking aggregation language could be applied in real ranking problems of P 2 P Web search systems...|$|R

In this paper, we propose an efficient and flexible decentralized multicast key distribution scheme with less computational cost and more functionality. The merits include: (1) the scheme needs no shared keys table between the registration center and all members; (2) a group key is distributed by servers to eligible members; (3) the computation cost is very low; (4) <b>members</b> and <b>servers</b> can authenticate each other; (5) our scheme is nonce-based and dose not have a serious time-synchronization problem; (6) also, the shared secret key distribution between dynamic participants is addressed in our proposed scheme...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We present ad hoc {{distributed}} servers, {{which are}} groups of unreliable nodes scattered over a wide-area network that cooperate {{to create the}} illusion of being a single reliable server. Maintaining such an illusion requires an ad hoc distributed server to provide stable contact addresses and enable its member nodes to transparently handoff client requests among each other. We propose to implement stable contact addresses and wide-area client handoffs using Mobile IPv 6. We demonstrate that the overhead due to contacting the server via its stable contact address can be estimated as the latency between the <b>server’s</b> <b>member</b> nodes. The client-perceived handoff time is also shown to be a linear function of the latencies between the client and the member nodes participating in the handoff...|$|R

This paper proposes a novel anycast routing protocol called Anycast Routing protocol based on Multi-Metrics (ARMM).

ARMM differs from other approaches as it uses values of bandwidth and delay on the direction from <b>servers</b> (anycast <b>members)</b> to clients, rather than the normal direction from clients to servers. So ARMM can select the best server/path with sufficient network resource (say bandwidth etc) for server data transmission to clients.

40|$|Abstract: Wireless environments such as GSM, 3 G, and 4 G {{are more}} and more popular. Consequently, {{communications}} in such networks need to be guarded. It is necessary to have a secure mutual authentication scheme to defend transactions between user and service provider against illegitimate adversaries. Especially, users are those vulnerable to attacks and there are many authentication schemes with smart-card proposed to protect them. Recently, Yung-Cheng Lee has suggested a dynamic identity based user authentication scheme to resist smart-card-theft attack. Nevertheless, he assumed that smart-card is tamperproof. In our opinion, this is not appropriate because Kocher and Messerges pointed that smart-card’s confidential information could be extracted by physically monitoring its power consumption. Therefore, design of Yung-Cheng Lee cannot withstand this kind of attack. In addition, anyone who is a legal <b>member</b> can masquerade <b>server</b> or other legal users in his scheme. Moreover, legitimacy verification only starting from server side truly makes Lee’s scheme be impractical. In this paper, we present an improvement to his scheme to isolate such problems...|$|R
