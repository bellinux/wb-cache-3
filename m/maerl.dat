50|$|In Europe <b>maerl</b> beds occur {{throughout}} the Mediterranean, along {{most of the}} Atlantic coast from Portugal to Norway, and in the English Channel, Irish Sea and North Sea. The distribution of <b>maerl</b> is dependent on water movement, light and salinity concentration. <b>Maerl</b> beds occur in the photic zone, {{and can be found}} to around 30 m depth in the British Isles and up to 120 m deep in the Mediterranean. <b>Maerl</b> deposits can reach up to 10 m thick, but are usually much thinner; carbon dating has shown that they can be more than 5500 years old.|$|E

[...] The term <b>maerl</b> originally refers to the branched growth form of Lemoine (1910) and the term rhodolith is sedimentalogical or genetic term for both the nodular and branched growth forms (Basso et. al, 2015).|$|E

50|$|<b>Maerl</b> is dredged {{from the}} sea floor and crushed to form a powder.

It was also dredged off Falmouth, Cornwall, but this ceased in 2004. Scientists investigated Falmouth <b>maerl</b> and found that L. corallioides predominated down to 6 m and P. calcareum from 6-10 m (Blunden et al., 1981).Chemical analysis of <b>maerl</b> showed that it contained 32.1% CaCO3 and 3.1% MgCO3 (dry weight).|$|E

The collection of unattached corallines (<b>maërl)</b> for use as soil conditioners dates to the 18th century. This is particularly significant in Britain and France, where more than 300,000 tonnes of Phymatolithon calcareum (Pallas) Adey & McKinnin and Lithothamnion corallioides are dredged annually. Some harvesting of <b>maërl</b> beds that span several thousand kilometres off the coast of Brazil takes place.

50|$|Coralline algae are {{red algae}} {{in the order}} Corallinales. They are {{characterized}} by a thallus that is hard because of calcareous deposits contained within the cell walls. The colors of these algae are most typically pink, or some other shade of red, but other species can be purple, yellow, blue, white or gray-green. Coralline algae {{play an important role}} in the ecology of coral reefs. Sea urchins, parrot fish, limpets (mollusks), and chitons (mollusks), feed on coralline algae. In the temperate Mediterranean sea, coralline algae are the main builders of a typical algal reef, the Coralligène ("coralligenous"). Many are typically encrusting and rock-like, found in marine waters all over the world. Only one species lives in freshwater. Unattached specimens (<b>maerl,</b> rhodoliths) may form relatively smooth compact balls to warty or fruticose thalli.|$|E
5000|$|A study {{conducted}} by researchers from the University of York in 2013, provides evidence {{that the creation of}} the NTZ in Lamlash bay has supported the regeneration of the seabed and overall biodiversity of the area. Animals which attach to the seabed, such as <b>maerl</b> and hydrozoans were found to be twice as abundant inside the NTZ than outside. In addition, within the NTZ, the average size of scallops and lobsters were larger. Scallops were more abundant, larger and older within the NTZ, while higher numbers of larger lobsters were found inside the NTZ, which is thought to increase their reproductive potential. [...] The majority of species found across all habitats in the NTZ were all bottom dwelling, opportunistic invertebrates (such as crabs and starfish), which suggests there is still some recovery to go.|$|E
50|$|Scotland's seas, which {{constitute}} an area {{greater than that}} of the seas around the rest of the UK, are among the most biologically productive in the world.

It is estimated that the total number of Scottish marine species exceeds 40,000. This includes 250 species of fish, the most numerous inshore variety being saithe, and deeper water creatures such as the dogfish, porbeagle and blue shark, European eel, sea bass, Atlantic halibut and various rays. There are four species of sea turtle, the leatherback, loggerhead, Kemp's ridley and green turtle. Scottish waters contain around 2,500 crustacean species and 700 molluscs and in 2012 a bed of 100 million flame shells was found during a survey of Loch Alsh.|$|E

This No Take Zone (NTZ) aims to protect <b>Maerl</b> seaweed beds and the regeneration of all marine life. It is hoped this NTZ will benefit the Lamlash economy by attracting scuba divers and by providing bigger and better catches for fishermen in the neighbouring overspill area.

40|$|<b>Maerl</b> beds occur {{worldwide}} and are formed by {{an accumulation of}} unattached calcareous red algae (Rhodophyta). Maerl-forming algae grow in a superficial living layer on sediments within the photic zone. <b>Maerl</b> beds are spatially complex habitats {{with a high degree}} of species and trophic group diversity. The European Commission’s ‘Habitats Directive’ mandates the conservation management of two of the main European maerl-forming species, Phymatolithon calcareum and Lithothamnion corallioides. Mediterranean <b>maerl</b> beds are to be considered for inclusion in national inventories of sites of conservation interest, as required by the SPABIM Protocol of the Barcelona Convention.

The ecology of northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean <b>maerl</b> beds has received little attention, in contrast to other marine communities (e. g. kelp forests, sea-grass meadows). Key conservation and management measures proposed include: the recognition that <b>maerl</b> beds are non-renewable resources and cannot sustain direct exploitation; prohibitions on the use of towed gear on <b>maerl</b> grounds; moratoria on the issue of further permits for the siting of aquaculture units above <b>maerl</b> grounds; monitoring of existing exploited or impacted <b>maerl</b> beds; the designation of ‘no-take’ reserves; measures to limit the impacts that might affect water quality above <b>maerl</b> beds; a programme of monitoring of the ‘health’ of European <b>maerl</b> beds; an awareness campaign on the biological importance of <b>maerl</b> beds; a higher conservation status for <b>maerl</b> habitats and maerlforming species in European legislation; and further research on <b>maerl</b> ecosystems. peer-reviewe...|$|E
