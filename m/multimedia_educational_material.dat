40|$|Inquiry-based {{learning}} in Science Education {{is based on}} the belief that it is crucial to ensure that students deeply understand what they are learning, and not simply repeat contents and information. To this extent, IBSE is not only a way to teach Science effectively, but more importantly it can be a way to teach how to learn in a broader sense, developing problem solving comprehension and critical thinking skills, using properly prior knowledge and rejecting naïve conceptions. It implies a cooperative endeavour, soliciting communicative skills to share with others observations and research questions, and it requires specific skills to work successfully as a part of a team. However, it is arguably that nowadays IBSE is a widespread teaching and learning practice, mainly because it involves more complex pedagogical skills than those needed for traditional face-to-face classes (e. g. organizing stimuli and experimental settings, managing the observational process and holding group discussion on formulating questions and ideas, guiding students in recording and reporting their experiences). But most of all, this happens because its development is multifaceted, highly personalized for each student, and based on a variety of sources and stimuli. In this frame of reference, several hints can be envisaged for designing e-learning solutions specifically devoted to strengthen a wider cultural perspective in Science Education, thanks to personalized and automated solutions for learning which includes: interactivity, <b>multimedia</b> <b>educational</b> <b>materials,</b> social networking, virtual environments for learning...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} an {{algebraic}} variable is both important {{in its own right}} and foundational for higher levels of math, but many students struggle to comprehend its meaning and purpose, demonstrating a variety of misconceptions about the interpretation of a variable and algebra’s relation to arithmetic. Common educational practices fail to support a substantial portion of students in connecting their intuitive cognitive capabilities to the formal external representations (i. e., symbolic notation) of algebra, depriving these students of understanding how and why variables are used, as well as their relevance in solving real-world problems. Previous attempts at improving students’ understanding of variables have focused on schematic induction across varied concrete examples or the generalization of relational thinking from arithmetic. While these efforts are important, the approaches do not fully elucidate the purpose of using formal symbols (e. g., letters) to represent unknown numbers. I posit that the clearest way to demonstrate the purpose of symbolic variables is through students’ formulation and attempted solution of mathematical problems where multiple unknowns must be represented (and distinguished from each other), such as in a system of equations word problem. Guided by principles from cognitive psychology and educational research, I formulate a framework for encouraging and supporting students’ intuitive discovery of the concept of variable using purpose-driven contrast comparisons, active learning techniques such as constructive struggling with intuitive hints, and contextual facilitation of students’ natural problem solving for meaningful, concrete tasks. Through this process, variables representations are introduced progressively, first by using more interpretable word equations and later by abbreviating word phrases into letter symbols. I implemented this framework into novel <b>multimedia</b> <b>educational</b> <b>materials,</b> which were iteratively piloted and revised, and then experimentally tested with {{middle and high school students}} against a more traditionally structured control version of the materials and a baseline condition. The results from this experimental testing suggest that students who were encouraged to infer the purpose of a variable before its formal representation was introduced went on to provide more correct answers to analogous problems on a post-test given 1 - 3 weeks later...|$|R
