25|$|The Aghoris of Varanasi perform shava sadhana {{with some}} {{difference}} in the ritual. The corpse is bound to a stake at the wrist or ankle by a silken thread and a protective circle drawn around it to keep evil spirits of the cremation ground away. The spirits are offered meat and liquor outside the circle. The spirits would try {{to talk with the}} practitioner and gain entry in the circle but he should ignore them until finally he will conquer them, forcing them to accept his offerings and leave. This is signified by the corpse's <b>mouth</b> <b>opening</b> a bit. An offering of kheer is put in the corpse's mouth. Finally, the Aghori decapitates the corpse to acquire its skull or extracts a bone from its spine to gain control over its soul. The remaining body is cast in the river. The rite should be followed by a period of asceticism to gain mastery of the soul of the deceased. While the Aghori sits on the corpse's chest and meditates, the ojha (exorcist or wizard) performs the ritual by seating on the stomach of the deceased.|$|E

Each polyp is a sac-like animal typically only a few millimeters in diameter and a few centimeters in length. A set of tentacles surround a central <b>mouth</b> <b>opening.</b> An exoskeleton is excreted near the base. Over many generations, the colony thus creates a large skeleton that is characteristic of the species. Individual heads grow by asexual reproduction of polyps.

The Antican mask didn't allow for any movement at all {{with the exception of the}} actors being able to poke their tongues through the <b>mouth</b> <b>opening.</b> Although this is the only major appearance of either the Anticans or the Selay, they continued to be used as background extras in other episodes of The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine. Westmore repainted the Selay masks prior to reusing them in order to give the scales more of a three-dimensional look.|$|E
500|$|The water {{vascular}} {{system of the}} starfish is a hydraulic system {{made up of a}} network of fluid-filled canals and is concerned with locomotion, adhesion, food manipulation and gas exchange. Water enters the system through the madreporite, a porous, often conspicuous, sieve-like ossicle on the aboral surface. It is linked through a stone canal, often lined with calcareous material, to a ring canal around the <b>mouth</b> <b>opening.</b> A set of radial canals leads off this; one radial canal runs along the [...] groove in each arm. There are short lateral canals branching off alternately to either side of the radial canal, each ending in an ampulla. These bulb-shaped organs are joined to tube feet (podia) on the exterior of the animal by short linking canals that pass through ossicles in the ambulacral groove. There are usually two rows of tube feet but in some species, the lateral canals are alternately long and short and there appear to be four rows. The interior of the whole canal system is lined with cilia.|$|E

40|$|The role {{of person}} and object in {{eliciting}} early imitation was {{examined in this}} study. Twenty-seven infants, between 5 and 8 weeks old were assigned randomly to two conditions. In the person condition (N = 12) they were presented with tongue protrusions and <b>mouth</b> <b>openings</b> modeled by an adult, whereas in the object condition (N = 15) they were presented with these gestures simulated by two objects. Two infant behaviors were coded: <b>mouth</b> <b>openings</b> and tongue pro-trusions. Infants in the person condition selectively reproduced the mouth open and tongue protrusion gestures at significant levels, infants in the object condition did not. Instead of reproducing the congruent gestures (<b>mouth</b> <b>openings</b> and tongue protrusions when they were modeled) infants in the object condition reproduced the incongruent gestures at significant levels. Together, the findings indicate that imitation is a social response, which has implications for the devel-opment of nonverbal communication and speech. ~tl IYYI Academic Press. Inc. The ability to imitate the actions of others has been accorded great significance {{in the development of}} thinking and behavior (Bandura, 1969; Piaget, 1962). In the developmental study of imitation, it was believed for many years that babies were unable to imitate gestures that they could not observe themselves perform until relatively late in infancy, (e. g., lo- 12 months of age, Piaget, 1962). Before this age, one could observe phenomena such as contagious crying and cooing, but selective imitation of facial behaviors, involving watching a model perform some action and then later replication, was not possible without a considerable amount of previous developmental experience (Piaget, 1962; Uzgiris & Hunt, 1975). Piaget’s account of the origins of imitation was challenged by the findings of Meltzoff and Moore (1977).

2500|$|The mask-makers {{were called}} skeuopoios or [...] "maker of the properties," [...] thus {{suggesting}} that their role encompassed multiple duties and tasks. The masks {{were most likely}} made out of light weight, organic materials like stiffened linen, leather, wood, or cork, with the wig consisting of human or animal hair. Due to the visual restrictions imposed by these masks, it was imperative that the actors hear in order to orient and balance themselves. Thus, {{it is believed that}} the ears were covered by substantial amounts of hair and not the helmet-mask itself. The <b>mouth</b> <b>opening</b> was relatively small, preventing the mouth to be seen during performances. Vervain and Wiles posit that this small size discourages the idea that the mask functioned as a megaphone, as originally presented in the 1960s. Greek mask-maker, Thanos Vovolis, suggests that the mask serves as a resonator for the head, thus enhancing vocal acoustics and altering its quality. This leads to increased energy and presence, allowing for the more complete metamorphosis of the actor into his character.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the belly}} {{side of the}} second head segment is the labrum, a <b>mouth</b> <b>opening</b> {{surrounded}} by sensitive [...] "lips". In the velvet worms, this structure is a muscular outgrowth of the throat, so, despite its name, it is probably not homologous to the labrum of the Arthropoda and is used for feeding. Deep within the oral cavity lie the sharp, crescent-shaped [...] "jaws", or mandibles, which are strongly hardened and resemble the claws of the feet, {{with which they are}} serially homologous; early in development, the jaw appendages have a similar position and shape to the subsequent legs. The jaws are divided into internal and external mandibles and their concave surface bears fine denticles. They move backward and forward in a longitudinal direction, tearing apart the prey, apparently moved in one direction by musculature and the other by hydrostatic pressure. [...] The claws are made of sclerotised α-chitin, reinforced with phenols and chinons, and have a uniform composition – except that there is a higher concentration of calcium towards the tip, presumably affording greater strength.|$|E
2500|$|Particularly {{characteristic}} of the Cycloneuralia is a ring of [...] "circumoral" [...] nerves around the <b>mouth</b> <b>opening,</b> which the proponents of the Ecdysozoa hypothesis also recognise in modified form {{in the details of}} the nerve patterns of the Panarthropoda. Both groups also share a common skin-shedding mechanism (ecdysis) and molecular biological similarities. One problem of the Ecdysozoa hypothesis is the velvet worms' subterminal mouth position: unlike in the Cycloneuralia, the mouth is not at {{the front end of the}} body, but lies further back under the belly. However, investigations into their developmental biology, particularly regarding the development of the head nerves, suggest that this was not always the case and that the mouth was originally terminal (situated at the tip of the body). This is supported by the fossil record. The [...] "stem-group arthropod" [...] hypothesis is very widely accepted, but some trees suggest that the onychophorans may occupy a different position; their brain anatomy is more closely related to that of the chelicerates than to any other arthropod. The modern velvet worms form a monophyletic group, incorporating all the descendants of their common ancestor. Important common derivative characteristics (synapomorphies) include, for example, the mandibles of the second body segment and the oral papillae and associated slime glands of the third; nerve strands extending along the underside with numerous cross-linkages per segment; and the special form of the tracheae. By 2011, some 180 modern species, comprising 49 genera, had been described; the actual number of species is probably about twice this. According to more recent study, 82 species of Peripatidae and 115 species of Peripatopsidae have been described thus far. However, among these 197 species, 20 are nomina dubia due to major taxonomic inconsistencies. The best-known is the type genus Peripatus, which was described as early as 1825 and which, in English-speaking countries, stands representative for all velvet worms. All genera are assigned to one of two families, the distribution ranges of which do not overlap but are separated by arid areas or oceans: ...|$|E
