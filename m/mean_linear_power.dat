40|$|We {{investigate}} the nonlinear evolution of structure in variants {{of the standard}} cosmological model which display damped density fluctuations relative to cold dark matter (e. g. in which cold dark matter is replaced by warm or interacting DM). Using N-body simulations, we {{address the question of}} how much information is retained from the initial <b>linear</b> <b>power</b> spectrum following the nonlinear growth of structure. We run a suite of N-body simulations with different initial <b>linear</b> matter <b>power</b> spectra to show that, once the system undergoes nonlinear evolution, the shape of the <b>linear</b> <b>power</b> spectrum at high wavenumbers does not affect the non-linear power spectrum, while it still matters for the halo mass function. Indeed, we find that <b>linear</b> <b>power</b> spectra which differ from one another only at wavenumbers larger than their half-mode wavenumber give rise to (almost) identical nonlinear power spectra at late times, regardless {{of the fact that they}} originate from different models with damped fluctuations.

Exploiting this result, we propose a two parameter model of the transfer function in generic damped scenarios, and show that this parametrisation works as well as the standard three parameter models for the scales on which the linear spectrum is relevant.

40|$|Small {{human lung}} {{specimens}} are frequently used for cell biological {{studies of the}} pathogenesis of emphysema. In general, lung function and other clinical parameters are used to establish the presence and severity of emphysema/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease without morphological analysis of the specimens under investigation. In this study we compared three morphological methods to analyze emphysema, and evaluated whether clinical data correlate with the morphological data of individual lung samples. A total of 306 lung specimens from resected lung(lobes) from 221 patients were inflated and characterized using three morphological parameters: the Destructive Index, the <b>Mean</b> <b>Linear</b> Intercept, and Section Assessment. Morphological data were related to each other, to lung function data, and to smoking behavior. Significant correlations (P <. 001) were observed between Section Assessment and Destructive Index (r = 0. 92), <b>Mean</b> <b>Linear</b> Intercept with Destructive Index (r = 0. 69) and <b>Mean</b> <b>Linear</b> Intercept with Section Assessment (r = 0. 65). Section Assessment, being much less time consuming than <b>Mean</b> <b>Linear</b> Intercept and Destructive Index, is the parameter of choice for initial analysis. Destructive Index is the most sensitive parameter. There was a significant (P <. 001), but weak correlation for all three parameters with the diffusion capacity for CO (K(CO)) (Destructive Index: r = - 0. 28; <b>Mean</b> <b>Linear</b> Intercept: r = - 0. 34; Section Assessment: r = - 0. 32), and with FEV(1) /IVC (Destructive Index: r = - 0. 29; <b>Mean</b> <b>Linear</b> Intercept: r = - 0. 33; Section Assessment: r = - 0. 28), but not with other lung function parameters. A significant difference (P <. 05) between (ex-) smokers and never-smokers was observed for Destructive Index and Section Assessment.

40|$|Reconstruction of the <b>linear</b> <b>power</b> {{spectrum}} from observational data {{provides a}} way to compare cosmological models to {{a large amount of}} data, as Peacock & Dodds (1994, 1996) have shown. By applying the appropriate corrections to the observational power spectrum it is possible to recover the underlying <b>linear</b> <b>power</b> spectrum for any cosmological model. Using extensive N-body simulations we demonstrate that the method is applicable {{to a wide range of}} cosmological models. However, we find that the recovery of the <b>linear</b> <b>power</b> spectrum from observations following PD 94 is misleading because the corrections are model- dependent. When we apply the proper corrections for a given model to the observational power spectrum, we find that no model in our test group recovers the <b>linear</b> <b>power</b> spectrum well for the bias suggested by PD 94 between Abell, Radio, Optical, and IRAS catalogs 4. 5 : 1. 9 : 1. 3 : 1, with b_IRAS= 1.

The resulting power spectrum is well behaved even at large wavenumbers and seems in good agreement with results from numerical simulations.
