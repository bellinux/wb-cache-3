5|$|The second {{scenario}} {{revolved around}} the discovery of an ancient <b>mausoleum</b> by archaeologists. An ancient virus contained in the <b>mausoleum</b> has quickly killed all the archaeological team, but prior to their death they radioed that a very important and undocumented tapestry is hanging inside. The local government is planning to cleanse the area with a fuel-air explosion in 15 minutes, so the scientists will send in an autonomous aerial robot to find the <b>mausoleum,</b> enter it (or send in a sensor probe/subvehicle) and relay pictures of the tapestry back prior {{to the destruction of}} the <b>mausoleum</b> and its contents.|$|E
50|$|Revash's <b>mausoleums</b> are architectonical rests {{found in}} the Amazonas region of Peru. Last century, Charles Wiener {{discovered}} the <b>mausoleums</b> of Utcubamba; the <b>mausoleums</b> of Revash in Santo Tomás were studied later by the archaeologists Henry and Paule Reichlen primarily because the roof {{of one of the}} <b>mausoleums</b> had collapsed, covering and protecting the cultural remains.|$|R

5|$|An ossuary and a <b>mausoleum</b> were erected on {{the site}} of the {{massacre}} in 1955, as was a monument by the sculptor Vojin Bakić. In 1991, amid inter-ethnic violence during the Croatian War of Independence, the monument and the <b>mausoleum</b> were destroyed by Croatian nationalists, as was another one of Bakić's works, Bjelovarac (The Man From Bjelovar). The ruins of the ossuary were removed by the local authorities in 2002. That same year, residents signed a petition to have the Bjelovarac monument erected once again.

5|$|Dinah {{continues}} {{searching the}} vaults and discovers that Edaniel and Edrear's sister, Eniri, is missing, {{and that the}} seed of the mausoleum—its link to the Host in the afterlife—has been stolen. Additionally, Edaniel and Edrear's other sister, Elala, is found dead. After Edaniel and Edrear lock down the <b>mausoleum,</b> they send Dinah home and she discovers that Maphohetka, a girl hanged for witchcraft and who now as a ghost can control minds in the real world, is manipulating Eniri and the townspeople. Unsuccessful in her attempt to stop her, Dinah flees to the <b>mausoleum</b> and receives a special outfit melted from the gold tolls that she and Vincent paid {{to gain access to}} the <b>mausoleum.</b> Returning, she confronts Maphohetka, who then orders Edaniel to kill her.|$|E
50|$|Judging by the osseous remains {{still present}} in the tombs, Revash's <b>mausoleums</b> were not used individually. For this reason, {{it is thought that}} the <b>mausoleums</b> were {{collective}} residences, destined to bury the prestigious and powerful.|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} half of the 15th century ahead of both <b>mausoleums</b> two new {{buildings}} were built. Two parallel rows were built in the 15th-17th centuries and joined with the other buildings. Also, some new <b>mausoleums</b> were also pairwise connected with intermediate iwan, decor on them do not exit anymore. In the 16th-17th centuries courtyards to the south and the north were built up with <b>mausoleums</b> of different sizes and from different eras. The entrance was set up on the west side of the yard. The majestic ensemble stands out as a group of <b>mausoleums,</b> homogeneous in structure and decoration, though built in different styles.|$|R
50|$|Some {{other reasons}} can be stated for Ka'ba-ye Zartosht being a mausoleum; {{one is the}} triad and heptad units that are seen in the Achaemenid <b>mausoleums.</b> For example, the three-tomb {{chambers}} of the <b>mausoleums</b> connect them to making Ka'ba-ye Zartosht three-floor and its platform having three stairs; and the seven hatches of each floor of the structure remarks the Seven Persian Noblemen on the <b>mausoleums</b> and the Tomb of Cyrus having seven floors.|$|R
