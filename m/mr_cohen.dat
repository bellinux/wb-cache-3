The maître d' was portrayed by actor James Hong; {{it is one of}} the actor's most famous roles in the United States. (In fact, he had a small part in a season one episode of The Bob Newhart Show in 1972, portraying a man who is mistaken for a maître d'.) [...] Judy Kain—known for a recurring role on Married... with Children—guest-starred as Lorraine Catalano, the receptionist of Jerry's uncle. David Tress guest-starred as <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cohen,</b> a guest who enters the restaurant and receives a table without reservation, as he is good friends with the maître d'. Larry David's voice can be heard among the group of elderly people Elaine offers money to for one of their egg-rolls. Norman Brenner—who worked as Richards' stand-in on the show for all its nine seasons—appears as an extra; he is sitting by the door of the restaurant when George, Jerry, and Elaine enter, and is still at the same spot when they leave.|$|E

At a record release {{party for the}} album in January 2012, Cohen spoke with The New York Times reporter Jon Pareles who states that [...] "mortality was very much on his mind and in his songs [...]" [...] Pareles goes to characterize the album as [...] "an autumnal album, musing on memories and final reckonings, {{but it also has}} a gleam in its eye. It grapples once again with topics <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cohen</b> has pondered throughout his career: love, desire, faith, betrayal, redemption.

6000|$|The {{invitation}} was doubly echoed, and Deronda gladly accepted it. All {{now turned}} and stood round the table.
