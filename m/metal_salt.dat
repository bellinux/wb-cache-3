25|$|The Chichibabin {{pyridine}} synthesis {{was reported}} in 1924 and is still in use in industry. In its general form, the reaction {{can be described as}} a condensation reaction of aldehydes, ketones, α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, or any combination of the above, in ammonia or ammonia derivatives. In particular, unsubstituted pyridine is produced from formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, which are inexpensive and widely available. First, acrolein is formed in a Knoevenagel condensation from the acetaldehyde and formaldehyde. It is then condensed with acetaldehyde and ammonia into dihydropyridine, and then oxidized with a solid-state catalyst to pyridine. This process is carried out in a gas phase at 400–450°C. The product consists of a mixture of pyridine, simple methylated pyridines (picoline), and lutidine; its composition depends on the catalyst used and can be adapted {{to the needs of the}} manufacturer. The catalyst is usually a transition <b>metal</b> <b>salt</b> such as cadmium(II) fluoride or manganese(II) fluoride, but cobalt and thallium compounds can also be used. The recovered pyridine is separated from byproducts in a multistage process.|$|E

2500|$|In the literature, {{there is}} much debate and {{confusion}} over the usage of the terms coagulation and flocculation—where does coagulation end and flocculation begin? [...] In water purification plants, there is usually a high energy, rapid mix unit process (detention time in seconds) where the coagulant chemicals are added followed by flocculation basins (detention times range from 15 to 45 minutes) where low energy inputs turn large paddles or other gentle mixing devices to enhance the formation of floc.

2500|$|Fluoroscopy's {{origins and}} radiography's origins can both {{be traced back}} to 8 November 1895, when Wilhelm Röntgen, or in English script Roentgen, noticed a barium {{platinocyanide}} screen fluorescing as a result of being exposed to what he would later call X-rays (algebraic x variable signifying [...] "unknown"). [...] Within months of this discovery, the first crude fluoroscopes were created. [...] These experimental fluoroscopes were simply thin cardboard screens that had been coated on the inside with a layer of fluorescent <b>metal</b> <b>salt,</b> attached to a funnel-shaped cardboard eyeshade which excluded room light with a viewing eyepiece which the user held up to his eye. The fluoroscopic image obtained in this way was quite faint. Even when finally improved and commercially introduced for diagnostic imaging, the limited light produced from the fluorescent screens of the earliest commercial scopes necessitated that a radiologist sit for a period in the darkened room where the imaging procedure was to be performed, to first accustom his eyes to increase their sensitivity to perceive the faint image. [...] The placement of the radiologist behind the screen also resulted in significant dosing of the radiologist.|$|E

The present work focusses on the ratio of aromatics generated on increasing the pyrolysis temperature {{in the presence of}} <b>metal</b> <b>salts,</b> iron(II), iron(III) and copper(II) chlorides.

30|$|We have {{investigated}} several <b>metal</b> <b>salts</b> {{that can be}} used as a hard mask for dry etching. Nickel salt has been previously studied [26]. However, nickel is a magnetic material and not allowed in dry etchers in many cleanrooms. Here, we extended the choice of <b>metal</b> <b>salts</b> that is more compatible with high dry etching selectivity. Aluminum and chromium are the two most commonly used metal hard mask materials for pattern transferring, so their salts were chosen in this study. For instance, selectivity between Cr and Si using non-switching pseudo-Bosch process that gives very smooth and vertical sidewall can reach 1 : 100 [27]. These metals are found in the form of <b>metal</b> <b>salts</b> such as aluminum (III) nitrate nonahydrate [Al(NO 3) 3 · 9 H 2 O] (ANN) and chromium (III) nitrate nonahydrate [Cr(NO 3) 3 · 9 H 2 O] (CNN). ANN and CNN have low melting points of 66 and 60  °C, respectively, which increase the chance of phase separation of the salt–polymer mixture at relatively low temperature.
