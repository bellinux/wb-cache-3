5|$|The final {{deliveries}} included six non-rigid airships, several kite {{balloons and}} additional aircraft, including two Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2C, and single examples of Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2D and Vickers F.B.9, {{along with some}} replacement airframes, bringing the total to 120 aircraft. In addition to the aircraft, numerous spares were sent, including engines and ancillary equipment such as cameras and seaplane beaching gear, along with 300 support vehicles consisting of motor transports, trailers and motorcycles. The value of the Imperial Gift was about $5 million, <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Canadian government spent on aviation from 1919 to 1923.|$|E
5|$|Rod Jones {{was known}} as a hard hitter and a {{world-class}} track star, but was a controversial selection because, coming from the run-heavy Southwest Conference, his pass-coverage skills were unknown. At 5'11", 165lbs., he was considered undersized for the NFL. Jones was the first defensive back selected, but was rated no better than fifth-best by most scouting services. The Buccaneers were criticized for taking linebacker Jackie Walker with their third pick, when Kevin Murphy of the national champion Oklahoma Sooners was still available. The Buccaneers did eventually draft Murphy, who they were surprised to find still available with their 40th overall selection. Murphy was believed to have fallen due to rumors of a knee injury. The Buccaneers had rated both Walker and Murphy among the top 15 players in the draft. Craig Swoope was rated as the best safety in the draft, but fell to the fourth round because of a previous charge (and acquittal) of conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Swoope was eventually the only Buccaneer to achieve any kind of postseason honors in 1986, being selected to the Football Digest All-Rookie team. The team went for big offensive linemen in the later rounds. One of them was J.D. Maarleveld, the first cancer patient drafted by the NFL. Maarleveld was considered to have been a second-round talent, but fell {{all the way to the}} fifth round. Belief that Maarleveld was worth much <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> average fifth-rounder caused his agent, Greg Marotta, to advise him to reject the Buccaneers' offer and sign with the USFL Baltimore Stars. Maarleveld was eventually able to reach agreement with the Buccaneers.|$|E

The Renfrew Hockey Club of the new National Hockey Association (NHA) announced that they had signed Taylor, but a week later Taylor said that he had decided to stay in Ottawa. After another week, Taylor changed his mind and said he would join Renfrew, signing for a reported $5,250 for one season (because of the high salaries the players got, the fans called them the Renfrew Millionaires). This made him the highest paid Canadian athlete, and he made <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Canadian prime minister.|$|E

In 1976, the state's constitution was amended to establish the Alaska Permanent Fund, in which a quarter of all mineral lease proceeds is invested. Income from the fund is used to pay annual dividends to all residents who qualify, to increase the fund's principal as a hedge against inflation, and to provide funds for the state legislature.

25|$|Companies {{occupy a}} special place in private law, because they have a legal {{personality}} separate from those who invest their capital and labour to run the business. The general rules of contract, tort and unjust enrichment operate in the first place against the company as a distinct entity. This differs fundamentally from other forms of business association. A sole trader acquires rights and duties as normal under the general law of obligations. If people carry on business together with a view to profit, they are deemed to have formed a partnership under the Partnership Act 1890 section 1. Like a sole trader, partners will be liable on any contract or tort obligation jointly and severally in shares equal to their monetary contribution, or according to their culpability. Law, accountancy and actuarial firms are commonly organised as partnerships. Since the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000, partners can limit the amount they are liable for to their monetary investment in the business, if the partnership owes <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> enterprise has. Outside these professions, however, the most common method for businesses to limit their liability is by forming a company.|$|E

500|$|To combat {{this fiscal}} crisis, the Caliph would often {{personally}} devote {{himself to the}} supervision of revenue, acquiring a reputation, according to F. Malti-Douglas, for [...] "a spirit of economy, verging on avarice"; he was said to [...] "examine petty accounts that a commoner would scorn to consider" [...] (Harold Bowen). Fines and confiscations multiplied under his rule, with the resulting revenue, along with the income from the crown domain and even {{a portion of the}} provincial taxation, flowing to the caliphal privy purse (bayt al-māl al-khāṣṣa). The latter now acquired a leading role among the other fiscal departments, and it frequently held <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> public treasury (bayt al-māl al-ʿāmma) itself. By the end of al-Mu'tadid's reign, the once empty privy purse would contain ten million dinars. On the other hand, in a measure aimed to ease the tax burden of the farmers, in 895 the Caliph changed the start of the tax year from the Persian New Year in March to 11 June—which became known as Nayrūz al-Muʿtaḍid, [...] "al-Mu'tadid's New Year"—so that the land tax (kharāj) was now collected after the harvest instead of before.|$|E

[...] Several years after completing the school, the organization helped establish trails and build a rainforest information center, followed in 1997 by an elevated canopy walkway as part of an ecotourism project to help generate income for the people and provide funds for a retirement system for the village elders. [...] The walkway has since become one of Samoa's leading tourist attractions, and was yielding an average of $1,000 each month for the community in 2001—bringing in <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> villagers would have earned from selling their forest. [...] Satisfied with the results, the villagers at Falealupo declared that they would honor the contract they had made with Cox to protect the forest forever, rather than just 50years.

500|$|Byrne {{has written}} for Wired, {{outlining}} {{the relative merits of}} different distribution models with this one reflecting his [...] "self-distributionmodel" [...] in which [...] "the artist stands to receive the largest percentage of income from sales per unit—sales of anything.

Artists doing it for themselves can actually make <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> massive popstar, even though the sales numbers may seem minuscule by comparison." [...] The motivation for creating and marketing this album directly came in part from the very article Byrne wrote as well as Eno's belief that music fans want more than just the music on an album and prefer collectible deluxe editions as well as the live performances that promote them. A month after releasing the album, Byrne was skeptical of market saturation claiming [...] "I sense {{that a lot of people}} don't know we have a record out" [...] and hoped to counterbalance that ignorance with his tour. He also described the digital music market as [...] "so infinite [...] it's easy for music to get lost out there" [...] and has noted that this business model would not work for performers who are not already established.|$|E
