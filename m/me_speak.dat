2500|$|You've heard <b>me</b> <b>speak</b> of Mr Poirot? It was in 1904 he and I worked {{together}} – the Abercrombie forgery case – you remember he was run down in Brussels. Ah, {{those were the}} days Moosier. Then, do you remember [...] "Baron" [...] Altara? There was a pretty rogue for you! He eluded the clutches of half the police in Europe. But we nailed him in Antwerp – thanks to Mr. Poirot here.|$|E
2500|$|She said, [...] "It is {{one thing}} for me to come before a public magistracy and there to speak what they would have <b>me</b> <b>speak</b> and another when a man comes to me in a way of {{friendship}} privately." [...] Hutchinson's defense was that she had spoken only reluctantly and in private, and that she [...] "must either speak false or true in my answers" [...] in the ministerial context of the meeting. [...] The court, however, did not make any distinction between public and private statements.|$|E
2500|$|Reading [...] "And the Lord said to Moses: ‘Why do you cry to <b>Me?</b> <b>Speak</b> to the {{children}} of Israel, that they go forward," [...] Rabbi Eliezer taught that God was telling Moses that there is a time to pray briefly and a time to pray at length. God was telling Moses that God's children were in trouble, the sea cut them off, the enemy pursued, and yet Moses stood and said a long prayer! God told Moses {{that it was time to}} cut short his prayer and act.|$|E

2500|$|Swamiji {{elaborated}} on {{the reasons}} for the near total elimination of the Buddhist religion (Mahayana Buddhism) from India. He said that [...] "At the present day there is not one who calls oneself a Buddhist in India, the land of its birth." [...] This was because Buddha's philosophy clashed with the [...] "eternal rocks of the Vedas" [...] to which people, Brahmin's in particular, were wedded {{and did not want to}} accept change. Thus Buddhism could not survive in India. When Buddha was asked by his Brahmin disciples to translate his works, which were in the local language of the people, to Sanskrit, his reply was [...] "I am for the poor, for the people; let <b>me</b> <b>speak</b> in the tongue of the people." [...] Swamiji also mentioned in his speech the loss to India was the [...] "reforming zeal, that wonderful sympathy and charity for everybody, that wonderful leaven which Buddhism had brought to the masses." ...|$|E
2500|$|Channel 8 {{became known}} for its heavy {{schedule}} of local programs {{during the period from}} the 1950s through the 1980s. The most popular was a show aimed at younger audiences; Jerry Haynes hosted a local children's program on the station on-and-off from 1961 to 1996. Originally debuting in March 1961 as Mr. Peppermint, Haynes (who donned a red- and white-striped jacket and straw hat in his portrayal of the titular character, accompanied by a candy-striped cane) starred alongside a variety of puppet characters (performed by Vern Dailey) and presented various segments from educational content to cartoon shorts; five years after ending its original nine-year run on WFAA in 1970, the program was revived as the half-hour magazine-style educational series Peppermint Place in 1975, running for 21 additional years—expanding into syndication for its final seven—until the program ended its collective 30-year run in July 1996. Other notable WFAA local productions included the music series The Group And Chapman and its progenitor Sump'n Else (both of which were hosted by Ralph Baker Jr. and Ron Chapman), Dallas Bandstand (also hosted by Haynes), lifestyle and fashion talk program The Julie Bennell Show (hosted by Dallas Morning News food editor Julie Bunnell), the viewer Q series Let <b>Me</b> <b>Speak</b> to the Manager (originally titled Ask the Manager and later named Inside Television for the final four years of its run, co-hosted by Belo vice president Myron [...] "Mike" [...] Shapiro), and local versions of the Dialing for Dollars and PM Magazine franchises. Channel 8 also served as the original Dallas-Fort Worth home of the magazine series Texas Country Reporter, after host Bob Phillips, who originated it on KDFW in September 1972 as the locally produced 4 Country Reporter, sold the series into regional syndication (airing on WFAA under the title 8 Country Reporter) in 1986.|$|E
