500|$|Win Butler and Josh Deu founded Arcade Fire in Montreal around 2001, having {{first met}} at Phillips Exeter Academy as high school students. Butler and Deu's musical ideas {{began to develop}} and the first {{incarnation}} of the band was born while they were attending McGill University and Concordia University, respectively. The duo began rehearsing their material at McGill where they met Régine Chassagne, a music student whom they asked to join them. Deu recalls, [...] "Win and I played guitar. Everyone played guitar. We had no music to show her, but she ended up saying yes to joining us, and I don’t know why. <b>Maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a little spark with Win." [...] The trio recorded a set of demos and began performing live {{in the second half}} of 2001. At that time, the band consisted of Butler, Chassagne, Deu, multi-instrumentalist Tim Kyle (later of Wild Light), bassist Myles Broscoe (later of Les Angles Morts, Crystal Clyffs, and AIDS Wolf), guitarist/drummer Dane Mills (later of Crackpot) and multi-instrumentalist Brendan Reed (later of Les Angles Morts and founding member of Clues), who lived with Butler and Chassagne in Montreal's Mile End neighbourhood at the time and was a collaborator with them on song-writing and arrangement (2001–2003).|$|E
2500|$|Despite this, {{other members}} of both groups appear to have {{remained}} on good terms since the initial controversy. Regarding the perceived conflict, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea stated [...] "There was never any fight between us, that {{was a bunch of}} bullshit created by the media. I mean I think they're a good band. <b>Maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> some things said between Anthony and the singer , but it all means nothing to me. Those guys in the band are nice people and there's no fight." [...] At a 2014 show in Brooklyn, the band also notably covered a portion of the Chuck Mosley-era song [...] "We Care a Lot".|$|E

According to Jerusalem Post, it is illegal for an occupying power to remove ancient {{artifacts}} from the land it occupies, but Israel maintains that the Palestinians {{have not been able to}} safeguard antiquities in the areas under their control, where looting is common. In the past, looted items have been sold to Israelis. Hananya Hizmi, deputy of Israel's Department of Antiquities in Judea and Samaria, explained, [...] "Probably it was done to preserve the mosaic. <b>Maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> an intention to return [...] and it didn't work out. I don't know why." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 1985 interview, {{when asked}} what caused his change of opinion, Hynek responded, [...] "Two things, really. One was the {{completely}} negative and unyielding attitude of the Air Force. They wouldn't give UFOs the chance of existing, {{even if they were}} flying {{up and down the street}} in broad daylight. Everything had to have an explanation. I began to resent that, even though I basically felt the same way, because I still thought they weren't going about it in the right way. You can't assume that everything is black no matter what. Secondly, the caliber of the witnesses began to trouble me. Quite a few instances were reported by military pilots, for example, and I knew them to be fairly well-trained, so this is when I first began to think that, well, <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> something to all this." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the closing}} {{arguments}} of Libby's trial, defense lawyer Ted Wells {{told the jury}} [...] "The government in its questioning really tried to put a cloud over Vice President Cheney...And the clear suggestion by the questions were, well, <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> some kind of skullduggery, some kind of scheme between Libby {{and the vice president}} going on in private, but that's unfair." [...] Patrick Fitzgerald responded to this assertion by telling the jury, [...] "You know what? [...] said something here that we're trying to put a cloud on the vice president. We'll talk straight. There is a cloud over the vice president. He sent Libby off to [...] Judith Miller at the St. Regis Hotel. At that meeting, the two-hour meeting, the defendant talked about the wife [...] We didn't put that cloud there. That cloud remains because the defendant obstructed justice and lied about what happened." ...|$|E

60|$|The latter {{sensation}} {{was strong}} in Honor herself, {{as she walked}} into the room between her beautiful pair, and contrasted Lucilla with her contemporary, a formed and finished young lady, all plaits, ribbons, and bracelets--not half so pleasing an object as the little maid in her white frock, blue sash, and short wavy hair, though <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> something quaint in such simplicity, to eyes trained by fashion instead of by good taste.|$|E
60|$|<b>Maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{a murmur}} {{in the village}} streets, a novel and {{dominant}} topic in the public-houses, and {{here and there a}} messenger, or even an eye-witness of the later occurrences, caused a whirl of excitement, a shouting, and a running to and fro; {{but for the most part}} the daily routine of working, eating, drinking, sleeping, went on as it had done for countless years--as though no planet Mars existed in the sky. Even at Woking station and Horsell and Chobham that was the case.|$|E

50|$|In the 1991 Blade Runners {{documentary}} Jayne says: “I didn’t like Revolution {{at first}} because I’m not an aggressive person, so it was good that he pushed it because it brought out another side of me - another character that I could portray”. Chris {{then goes on to}} explain the theme of the piece, and explains how it leads into imagine and why the perform the two pieces together: “the idea is of it’s a young couple that have been married for a few years and it’s not that fairytale life of happiness. Which happens {{to a lot of people}} - that something goes wrong and tension builds and anger grows within that. And I wanted to put that onto the ice - this raw aggression - and overstate it - so that, for people sitting right the way back, it becomes literal though body. But it follows on in a sort of resolve - not necessarily a happy ending - it then goes into Imagine. <b>Maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> something else, <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a compromise or at least an understanding of their situation.

60|$|It {{ought to}} have sounded so ridiculous to them both; told on English soil in the year One Thousand Nine Hundred and Fourteen to a smart young officer of Engineers and an elderly Oxford Professor. Across the road the doctor's odd man was opening garage doors; a noisy milk cart was {{clattering}} through the village a little late for the London train; a faint odour of eggs and bacon came wafted through the garden, mingled {{with the scent of}} lavender and pinks. For Commander Raffleton, <b>maybe,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> excuse. This story, so far as it has gone, has tried to make that clear. But the Professor! He {{ought to have}} exploded in a burst of Homeric laughter, or else to have shaken his head at her and warned her where little girls go to who do this sort of thing.|$|E
6000|$|There was {{considerable}} jawing back, so I slid out, thinking <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{going to be}} trouble. The streets was full, and everybody was excited. Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened, {{and there was a}} big crowd packed around each one of these fellows, stretching their necks and listening. One long, lanky man, with long hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat {{on the back of his}} head, and a crooked-handled cane, marked out the places on the ground where Boggs stood and where Sherburn stood, and the people following him around from one place to t'other and watching everything he done, and bobbing their heads to show they understood, and stooping a little and resting their hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with his cane; and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had stood, frowning and having his hat-brim down over his eyes, and sung out, [...] "Boggs!" [...] and then fetched his cane down slow to a level, and says [...] "Bang!" [...] staggered backwards, says [...] "Bang!" [...] again, and fell down flat on his back. The people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect; said it was just exactly the way it all happened. Then as much as a dozen people got out their bottles and treated him.|$|E

It appeared to them that several of his acts were distinctly tyrannical, and were encroachments upon rights of theirs which the other teacher, with all his severity, had respected. My boy was inspired by the common mood to write a tragedy which had the despotic behavior of the new teacher for its subject, and which was intended to be represented by the boys in the hayloft of a boy whose father had a stable without any horse in it. The tragedy was written in the measure of the [...] "Lady of the Lake," [...] which was the last poem my boy had heard his father reading aloud; it was very easy kind of verse. At the same time, the boys were to be dressed as Roman conspirators, {{and one of them was}} to give the teacher a petition to read, while another plunged a dagger into his vitals, and still another shouted, [...] "Strike, Stephanos, strike!"

60|$|It {{was over}} at last, and {{the hall of}} justice broke up. Mary Morris was at once in her mother's arms, {{and in a few}} minutes more making up for all past privations by a {{substantial}} meal in the kitchen. But Mrs. Kelland had gone to Avoncester to purchase thread, and only her daughter Susan had come up, the girl {{who was supposed to be}} a sort of spider, with no capacities beyond her web. Nor did Rachel think Lovedy capable of walking down to Mackarel Lane, nor well enough for the comfortless chairs and the third part of a bed. No, Mr. Grey's words that Rachel was accountable for the children's sufferings had gone to her heart. Pity was there and indignation, but these had brought such an anguish of self-accusation as she could only appease by lavishing personal care upon the chief sufferer. She carried the child to her own sitting-room and made a couch for her before the fire, sending Susan away with the assurance that Lovedy should stay at the Homestead, and be nursed and fed till she was well and strong again. Fanny, who had accompanied her, thought the child very ill, and was urgent that the doctor should be sent for; but between Rachel and the faculty of Avonmouth there was a deadly feud, and the proposal was scouted. Hunger and a bad cold were easily treated, and <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a spark of consolation in having a patient all to herself and her homoeopathic book.|$|E
