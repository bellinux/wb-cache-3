5|$|A {{group of}} thieves stole, {{on a summer}} day, horses {{that belonged to the}} Monastery of StJovan Vladimir. When they came to the nearby stream of Kusha to take the horses across, it {{appeared}} to them like an enormous river. They moved away from it in fear, but when they looked back from a distance, the stream appeared small. As they approached it again, the Kusha again became huge and impassable. After several such attempts to cross the stream, the thieves realized that this was a <b>miracle</b> <b>of</b> the saint, so they released the monastery's horses and ran away in horror.|$|E
5|$|Between June and September 1944, the Wehrmacht {{had lost}} {{more than a million}} men, and it lacked the fuel and armaments needed to operate effectively. On 12 April 1945, Hitler, who had earlier decided to remain in the city against the wishes of his advisers, heard the news that the American President Franklin D. Roosevelt had died. This briefly raised false hopes in the Führerbunker that there might yet be a falling out among the Allies and that Berlin would be saved at the last moment, as had {{happened}} once before when Berlin was threatened (see the <b>Miracle</b> <b>of</b> the House of Brandenburg).|$|E

5|$|In late 2013 {{multiple}} copyright strikes {{were issued}} by Youtube against Dunne's videos {{for use of}} his own music, as well as against other users who had used his music in their videos with permission. All of the strikes were initiated by INDMUSIC, on behalf of TuneCore, the company that distributed <b>Miracle</b> <b>of</b> Sound's songs at the time. Though the incident was resolved successfully, Dunne commented that although TuneCore {{was trying to help}} artists, their efforts did more damage than good and that he depends on let's plays and gaming videos to spread and popularize his music by word of mouth.|$|E
5|$|The 1940 film Florian stars two Lipizzan stallions. It {{was based}} on a 1934 novel written by Felix Salten. The wife of the film's {{producer}} owned the only Lipizzans in the US {{at the time that the}} movie was made. The rescue during World War II of the Lipizzan stallions is depicted in the 1963 Walt Disney movie <b>Miracle</b> <b>of</b> the White Stallions. The movie was the only live-action, relatively realistic film set against a World War II backdrop that Disney has ever produced.|$|E
5|$|The {{rescue of}} the Lipizzans by the United States Army, {{made famous by}} the Disney movie <b>Miracle</b> <b>of</b> the White Stallions, {{occurred}} in two parts: The United States Third Army {{under the command of}} General George S. Patton, was near St. Martins in the spring of 1945 and learned that the Lipizzan stallions were in the area. Patton himself was a horseman, and like Podhajsky, had competed in the Olympic Games. On May 7, 1945, Podhajsky put on an exhibition of the Spanish Riding School stallions for Patton and Undersecretary of War Robert P. Patterson, and at its conclusion requested that Patton take the horses under his protection.|$|E

5|$|Alvin Plantinga's {{free will}} defense {{is a logical}} {{argument}} developed by American analytic philosopher Alvin Plantinga, the John A. O'Brien Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at the University of Notre Dame, and published in its final version in his 1977 book God, Freedom, and Evil. Plantinga's argument is a defense against the logical problem of evil as formulated by philosopher J. L. Mackie beginning in 1955. Mackie's formulation of the logical problem of evil argued that three attributes of God, omniscience, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence, in orthodox Christian theism are logically incompatible with the existence of evil. In 1982, Mackie conceded that Plantinga's defense successfully refuted his argument in The <b>Miracle</b> <b>of</b> Theism, {{though he did not}} claim that the problem of evil had been put to rest.|$|E
5|$|Following a backlash, Dr Manhattan exiles {{himself to}} Mars, giving the Soviets the {{confidence}} to invade Afghanistan. Rorschach's theory appears to be justified when Veidt narrowly avoids an assassination attempt, and Rorschach finds himself framed {{for the murder of}} a former villain named Moloch. When Rorschach is arrested, his identity is revealed to be Walter Kovacs, and he is sent to jail. Jupiter goes to stay with Dreiberg after breaking up with Manhattan. The two become lovers and decide to come out of retirement. After helping Rorschach break out of prison, Jupiter is confronted by Manhattan, who transports her to Mars. As he probes her memories, he discovers that she is Blake's daughter, and realizes the <b>miracle</b> <b>of</b> her life, created in spite of her parents' turbulent relationship. He then returns to Earth with her.|$|E
5|$|Following {{two decades}} of uneasy peace, Britain and France {{declared}} war against one another in 1689. Despite the 1669 Treaty of Whitehall, in which European forces agreed that Continental conflicts would not disrupt colonial peace and neutrality, the war was fought primarily by proxy in New France and New England. The British of New York prompted local Iroquois warriors to attack New France's undefended settlements. While the British were preparing to engage in acts of warfare, the inhabitants of New France were ill-prepared to defend against the Indian attacks” due to {{the isolation of the}} farms and villages. Denonville was quoted as saying “If we have a war, nothing can save the country but a <b>miracle</b> <b>of</b> God,”.|$|E

5|$|Milan were {{regarded}} as favourites before the match and took the lead within the first minute through captain Paolo Maldini. Milan striker Hernán Crespo added two more goals before half-time to make it 3–0. In the second half Liverpool launched a comeback and scored three goals in a dramatic six-minute spell to level the scores at 3–3, with goals from Steven Gerrard, Vladimír Šmicer and Xabi Alonso. The scores remained the same during extra time, and a penalty shoot-out was required to decide the champions. The score was 3–2 to Liverpool when Andriy Shevchenko's penalty was saved by Liverpool goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek. Thus Liverpool won their fifth European Cup, were awarded the trophy permanently, and claimed a multiple-winner badge. Liverpool's comeback {{gave rise to the}} final being known as the <b>Miracle</b> <b>of</b> Istanbul, and is {{regarded as one of the}} greatest finals in the history of the tournament.|$|E
5|$|The Bhramapureeswarar temple, {{also called}} Sattainathar temple, {{is an ancient}} temple complex {{dedicated}} to Shiva, and has three Shiva shrines. The temple is mentioned in the Saiva canonical work, Tevaram, by Thirugnana Sambanthar, Tirunavukkarasar and Sundarar, the foremost Saivite saints of 7th–eighth century CE and is classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. There is a separate shrine for Sambandar celebrating the <b>miracle</b> <b>of</b> Parvathi suckling the child Sambandar when he was crying for milk. Shiva is worshipped in three different forms; the Shivalingam (Bhrammapureeswarar), Uma Maheswarar (Toniappar) at the middle level, and Bhairavar (Sattanathar) at the upper level. The original temple was enlarged {{during the period of}} Kulothunga Chola I, Vikrama Chola, Kulothunga Chola II and Kulothunga Chola III (as in Chidambaram – 11th through the 13th centuries). Every year in the Tamil month of Chithirai (April – May), a 10-day festival is celebrated.|$|E
5|$|Indira Parthasarathy's Nandan Kathai (1978) {{builds the}} tale of Nandanar (referred in the work as Nandan) further, {{introducing}} two non-Brahmin upper caste landholders, who are as ruthless as Bharati's Vediyar. Nandanar is portrayed as a lover of art, rather than God. He {{wants to see the}} cosmic dance of Nataraja. A Devadasi called Abhirami also appears; no significant female characters are found in earlier narratives. Indira is blunt in reprimanding the Dalits for not understanding Nandanar. Nandan Kathai is a quest for liberation of Dalits and women alike. Unlike earlier narratives, Indira's tale is devoid of miracles and is a story of how Nandanar falls prey to a conspiracy. The Vediyar-priest, the Vediyar-landlord and the two non-Brahmin upper caste landholders, hatch a plot to end Nandan. They make Nandanar believe that God harvested crop from the field, an allusion to the <b>miracle</b> <b>of</b> Vediyar's impossible task in Bharati's work. Then, they persuade him to organize a dance contest between Bharatnatyam, the high-caste elites' dance and the folk dance of the Dalits. Finally, in the climax, Nandanar agrees to undergo a fire-trial, reassured by the earlier miracle, but he and Abhirami burn in the flames. The upper castes succeed in sending a warning to Dalits how trespassers of the caste code, longing for salvation, would be punished.|$|E

5|$|The Yankee {{opponent}} in the 1951 World Series was the Giants, with Game 1 played the day after they won the National League pennant in the <b>Miracle</b> <b>of</b> Coogan's Bluff. On an emotional high, the Giants beat the Yankees in Game 1 at Yankee Stadium. Game 2 was a Yankee victory, but Mantle suffered a knee injury and was out for the Series, the start of knee problems that would darken Mantle's career. The Giants won Game 3, but DiMaggio stepped to the fore, with six hits in the following three games, including a home run to crown his career. The Yankees won Games 4 and 5, and staked Raschi to a 4–1 lead in Game 6 before Stengel had Johnny Sain pitch in relief. When Sain loaded the bases with none out in the ninth, Stengel brought in Bob Kuzava, a left hander, to pitch against the Giants, even though right handers Monte Irvin and Bobby Thomson were due to bat. The Giants scored twice, but Kuzava hung on. The Yankees and Stengel had their third straight World Series championship.|$|E
5|$|Within Dorchester parish {{there are}} 293 {{structures}} that are listed by Historic England for their historic or architectural interest, including five that are listed Grade I and sixteen that are Grade II*. The Grade I structures are the Church of St George on Fordington High Street, the Church of St Peter on High West Street, Max Gate on Syward Road, the Roman town house on Northernhay, and Shire Hall on High West Street. The Church of St George has a late-11th-century south door {{that has a}} Caen stone tympanum with a realistic carved representation of St George surrounded by soldiers, said to depict the <b>miracle</b> <b>of</b> his appearance at the Battle of Antioch. The south aisle and the north part of the porch date from the 12th century. The Church of St Peter mostly dates from 1420–21, with a 12th-century south doorway reset into it. There are many notable monuments, including two 14th-century effigies and a 14th-century tomb chest. Thomas Hardy contributed to {{the addition of the}} vestry and chancel in 1856-7. Max Gate was designed by Thomas Hardy in the Queen Anne style, and was his home until his death in 1928. It was built in 1885. The remains of the Roman house north of county hall date from the early 4th century, with later 4th-century enlargements. It has a hypocaust heating system and mosaic pavements. It is the only visible Roman town house in Britain. The current Shire Hall building was designed by Thomas Hardwick and built in Portland stone ashlar in 1797. It replaced a previous structure that had fallen into disrepair. A tablet commemorates the sentencing of the Tolpuddle Martyrs here in 1834. The building housed the Crown Court until 1955; Thomas Hardy was a magistrate here and his experience provided inspiration for his writing. The building has changed little since the 19th century, and in 2014 planning permission was granted to transform it into a heritage centre and tourist attraction, to open in 2017.|$|E
