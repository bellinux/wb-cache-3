40|$|Atoms in high-lying Rydberg {{states with}} large values of {{principal}} quantum number n, n ≥ 300, form a valuable laboratory in which to explore the control and manipulation of quantum states of mesoscopic size using carefully tailored sequences of short electric field pulses whose characteristic times (duration and/or rise/fall times) are less than the classical electron orbital period. Atoms react to such pulse sequences very differently than to short laser or microwave pulses providing {{the foundation for a}} number of new approaches to engineering atomic wavefunctions. The remarkable level of control that can be achieved is illustrated with reference to the generation of localized wavepackets in Bohr-like near-circular orbits, and the production of non-dispersive wavepackets under periodic driving and their transport to targeted regions of phase space.

40|$|Solid mixed {{conductors}} {{with significant}} ionic {{as well as}} electronic conduction play a pivotal role for mass transfer and storage as required in battery electrodes. Single-phase materials with simultaneously high electronic and ionic conductivity at room temperature {{are hard to come}} by and therefore multi-phase systems with separate ion and electron channels have been put forward instead. Here, we explore bilayer graphene as a true single phase mixed conductor and demonstrate ultrafast lithium diffusion exceeding diffusion in bulk graphite by an order of magnitude and even surpassing diffusion of sodium chloride in liquid water. To this end, an innovative electrochemical cell architecture has been developed where the redox-reaction forcing lithium intercalation is localized at a protrusion of the device only. Its remainder consists of pristine bilayer graphene unperturbed by an electrolyte. The geometry lends itself to the use of magnetotransport machinery known from <b>mesoscopic</b> low-dimensional <b>physics.</b> Time dependent Hall measurements across spatially displaced Hall probes deliver a direct view on the in-plane diffusion kinetics. The device layout with a perimeterial electrochemical cell is transferable to other 2 D materials as well as thin films and may promote a paradigm shift on the use of electrolytes in on-chip experiments.

Many quantities are measured at fixed energy, which is seemingly not well suited for a time-dependent formulation. Very few methods exist to obtain the energy-dependent Green function for complicated potentials without resorting to ensemble averages or using certain lead-in arrangements. Here, we demonstrate in detail a time-dependent approach, which can accurately and effectively construct the energy-dependent Green function for very general potentials.

40|$|Alcohol {{consumption}} {{interferes with}} the functioning of multiple organ systems, causing changes in the chemistry, physiology and pathology of tissues and cellular organelles. Although epigenetic modifications underlie the development of cancer, exposure to carcinogenic chemicals, such as alcohol, can also contribute to disease development. However, the effects of chronic alcoholism on normal or pre-carcinogenic cells/tissues in different organelles are not well understood. Therefore, we herein study the effect of alcohol consumption on colonic nucleus using control and azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) treated carcinogenic mice. Previous studies showed that progression of carcinogenesis is associated with increase {{in the degree of}} intranuclear nanoscale structural disorder. In the present work, we quantify the degree of nanostructural disorder as a measure of carcinogenesis. To accomplish this, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging of respective colonic epithelial cell nuclei are used to construct disordered optical lattices, and the properties of nanoscale disorder are then studied by analyzing the inverse participation ratio (IPR) of the spatially localized eigenfunctions of these optical lattices. Nanoscale structural disorder strength, as a marker of cancer progression, is measured in the length scale of 10 to 75 nm. Results show no significant visible effect in nanoscale structural changes on colon cell nuclei from alcohol exposure. However, alcohol was found to act as an enhancer of nanoscale disorder in precancerous cells and, hence, carcinogenic processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify the effect of alcohol on early carcinogenic biological cells, using <b>mesoscopic</b> condensed matter <b>physics.</b> Comment: 8 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|Ten years ago, {{coherent}} oscillations {{between two}} quantum states of a superconducting circuit differing {{by the presence}} or absence of a single Cooper pair on a metallic island were observed for the first time. This result immediately stimulated the development of several other types of superconducting quantum circuits behaving as artificial atoms, thus bridging <b>mesoscopic</b> and atomic <b>physics.</b> Interestingly, none of these circuits fully implements the now almost 30 year old proposal of A. J. Leggett to observe coherent oscillations between two states differing by {{the presence or absence}} of a single fluxon trapped in the superconducting loop interrupted by a Josephson tunnel junction. This phenomenon of reversible quantum tunneling between two classically separable states, known as Macroscopic Quantum Coherence (MQC), is regarded crucial for precision tests of whether macroscopic systems such as circuits fully obey quantum mechanics. In this article, we report the observation of such oscillations with sub-GHz frequency and quality factor larger than 500. We achieved this result with two innovations. First, our ring has an inductance four orders of magnitude larger than that considered by Leggett, combined with a junction in the charging regime, a parameter choice never addressed in previous experiments. Second, readout is performed with a novel dispersive scheme which eliminates the electromagnetic relaxation process induced by the measurement circuit (Purcell effect). Moreover, the reset of the system to its ground state is naturally built into this scheme, working even if the transition energy is smaller than that of temperature fluctuations. As we argue, the MQC transition could therefore be, contrary to expectations, the basis of a superconducting qubit of improved coherence and readout fidelity. Comment: 12 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the study}} of heat to work {{conversion}} has been re-invigorated by nanotechnology. Steady-state devices do this conversion without any macroscopic moving parts, through steady-state flows of microscopic particles such as electrons, photons, phonons, etc. This review aims to introduce some of the theories used to describe these steady-state flows {{in a variety of}} mesoscopic or nanoscale systems. These theories are introduced in the context of idealized machines which convert heat into electrical power (heat-engines) or convert electrical power into a heat flow (refrigerators). In this sense, the machines could be categorized as thermoelectrics, although this should be understood to include photovoltaics when the heat source is the sun. As quantum mechanics is important for most such machines, they fall into the field of quantum thermodynamics. In many cases, the machines we consider have few degrees of freedom, however the reservoirs of heat and work that they interact with are assumed to be macroscopic. This review discusses different theories which can take into account different aspects of <b>mesoscopic</b> and nanoscale <b>physics,</b> such as coherent quantum transport, magnetic-field induced effects (including topological ones such as the quantum Hall effect), and single electron charging effects. It discusses the efficiency of thermoelectric conversion, and the thermoelectric figure of merit. More specifically, the theories presented are (i) linear response theory with or without magnetic fields, (ii) Landauer scattering theory in the linear response regime and far from equilibrium, (iii) Green-Kubo formula for strongly interacting systems within the linear response regime, (iv) rate equation analysis for small quantum machines with or without [...] .
