5|$|The Prank War series, which depicts Blumenfeld and Streeter Seidell as {{they play}} a series of {{escalating}} practical jokes on each other, became popular {{and led to the}} two appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in 2009. MTV later hired Seidell and Blumenfeld to host Pranked, a clip show featuring prank videos from the Internet. Outside of CollegeHumor, Blumenfeld has appeared in the short film The Old Man and the Seymour, the television series Louie and I Just Want <b>My</b> <b>Pants</b> Back, and the 2011 film A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas. He also writes for ESPN The Magazine and Mental Floss.|$|E

500|$|In 2011, Blumenfeld {{appeared}} in comedian Louis C.K.'s television series Louie, during the 10th episode of its second season, entitled [...] "Halloween/Ellie". He played a writer hired to improve a movie script {{in the second}} half of the episode. Better With Popcorn George Prax said that he played [...] "the 'unfunny' guy who actually ends up coming off as the funniest of all to the audience", and that Blumenfeld [...] "should be guesting and starring in many more things". He also called Blumenfeld's first sitcom appearance a [...] "clearly momentous occasion". Blumenfeld also had a part in I Just Want <b>My</b> <b>Pants</b> Back, an MTV show produced by Doug Liman.|$|E
500|$|Aubrey's success {{seemed to}} have gone to his head and he became even more arrogant. He was abusive to the network's affiliates, advertisers, {{producers}}, and talent. Friends of Aubrey's such as producers Dick Dorso of United Artists, Martin Ransohoff of Filmways, and David Susskind, who had each sold several series to CBS, suddenly found themselves shut out. [...] "He's a friend of mine, but he cut me stone cold last year," [...] Susskind said. [...] "I was hanging there with <b>my</b> <b>pants</b> down, wondering what I'd tell the stockholders." [...] Gossip columnist Liz Smith, who worked as CBS during Aubrey's time there, called him a [...] "a mean, hateful, truly scary, bad, outré guy." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} verse, Beyoncé sings to the [...] "sexual teasing" [...] lyrics, which are {{addressed}} to the men looking at her: [...] "I can be a tease, but I really wanna please you [...] Oohhh you watchin me shake it, [...] Ya can't take it, it’s blazin ...". The chorus lines; [...] "Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight" [...] are sung in a very quick and breathless manner by Beyoncé. Bret McCabe noted that her pace could be {{compared to that of}} American singer Donna Summer. Slim Thug appears again after the second verse to perform another different verse rap: [...] "I’m checking on you boo, do what’chu do / And while you dance I’ma glance at this beautiful view / I’m keep my hands in <b>my</b> <b>pants,</b> I need to glue ’em with glue ...". Before the song ends, Beyoncé repeats the chorus lines four times as additional vocals of hers are played in the background.|$|E
6000|$|What {{more than}} marble must that heart compose, Can hearken coldly to my Sharper's vows? Then, when he trembles, when his blushes rise, When awful love seems melting in his eyes! [...] 90 With eager beats his Mechlin cravat moves: He loves!--I whisper to myself--he loves! Such unfeign'd passion in his looks appears, I lose all {{memory of my}} former fears; <b>My</b> <b>panting</b> heart confesses all his charms, I yield at once, and sink into his arms: Think of that moment, you who {{prudence}} boast; For such a moment, prudence well were lost.|$|R

500|$|None of {{the columns}} after Dunne joined The American Magazine {{attracted}} the attention the earlier ones had, but Mr. Dooley continued {{to comment on the}} issues of the day. [...] Andrew Carnegie was a repeated target, as was John D. Rockefeller, whom Dooley summed up with [...] "he never done anything wrong, save in the way of business" [...] In 1909, during the debates over the Payne–Aldrich Tariff, Dunne examined the bill and came out of it with an exotic item called [...] "divvy-divvy", which Mr. Dooley allowed, [...] "was let in as a compliment to [...] Senator Aldrich. It's his motto." [...] A seventh Dooley book was published in 1910, but given disappointing sales, the publishers abandoned plans for another in 1911. Although Dunne was a strong supporter of Roosevelt in the contentious 1912 presidential election, Mr. Dooley retained his customary above-the-fray attitude, mocking Roosevelt's excited oratory with Dooley feeling there was a large fire somewhere, a mystery solved when he opens the newspaper and learns [...] "much to my relief, that it was not <b>my</b> <b>pants</b> but the Republic that was on fire".|$|E

60|$|Two {{or three}} men trod on <b>my</b> <b>panting</b> body as they drew water, {{but they were}} evidently used {{to this sort of}} thing, and had no time to waste upon me. The {{situation}} was humiliating. Gunga Dass, indeed, when he had banked the embers of his fire with sand, was at some pains to throw half a cupful of fetid water over my head, an attention for which I could have fallen on my knees and thanked him, but he was laughing all the while in the same mirthless, wheezy key that greeted me on my first attempt to force the shoals. And so, in a semi-comatose condition, I lay till noon.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, <b>my</b> friends,' <b>panted</b> the archdeacon, 'we are escaped {{like the}} bird {{out of the}} snare of the fowler.

60|$|When my pantaloons ripped and tore, as I have said, I {{did my best}} to mend and patch them; but {{not being}} much of a sempstress, the more I patched the more they parted; because I put my patches on, without heeding the joints of the legs, which only irritated <b>my</b> poor <b>pants</b> the more, and put them out of temper.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 2015 the title track from Angst in <b>My</b> <b>Pants</b> was used in a {{commercial}} for men's underwear by retailer Tommy John. The ad was titled [...] "The Big Adjustment" [...] and depicted men, from various walks of life, attempting to secretly adjust their ill-fitting underwear to humorous effect.|$|E
2500|$|Another regular {{character}} is Maurice, the waiter at McCabe's club. Each time he serves McCabe's claret, he corrects the English pronunciation of Maurice (Morris) to the French (Maur-ees), {{and each time}} Prentiss puts him down with a verse like [...] "One man by circumstance is in splendour set; whilst another irons pants in a laundrette. Go and iron <b>my</b> <b>pants,</b> Morris".|$|E

Dobson even incorporated the happening into her performance by ad-libbing, [...] "I-I-I just split <b>my</b> <b>pants</b> and I don't care".|$|E

And so, in a semi-comatose condition, I lay till noon. Then, being only a man after all, I felt hungry, and intimated as much to Gunga Dass, whom I had begun to regard as my natural protector. Following the impulse of the outer world when dealing with natives, I put my hand into my pocket and drew out four annas. The absurdity of the gift struck me at once, and I was about to replace the money.|$|R
2500|$|Radner battled bulimia {{while on}} the show. She had a {{relationship}} with SNL castmate Bill Murray, with whom she worked at the National Lampoon, and that ended badly. Few details of their relationship or its end were made public. In It's Always Something, this is the one reference Radner made to Murray in the entire book: [...] "All the guys [...] liked to have me around because I would laugh at them till I peed in <b>my</b> <b>pants</b> and tears rolled out of my eyes. We worked together {{for a couple of years}} creating The National Lampoon Show, writing The National Lampoon Radio Hour, and even working on stuff for the magazine.

2500|$|In November 1992, {{two months}} prior to the {{production}} of season 1 of Rocko's Modern Life, Murray's first wife committed suicide. Murray had often blamed his wife's suicide on the show being picked up. He said [...] "It was always an awful connection because I look at Rocko as such a positive in my life." [...] Murray felt that he had emotional and physical [...] "unresolved issues" [...] when he moved to Los Angeles. He describes the experience as like participating in [...] "marathon with <b>my</b> <b>pants</b> around my ankles". Murray initially believed that he would create one season, move back to the San Francisco Bay Area, and [...] "clean up the loose ends I had left hanging". Murray said that he felt surprised when Nickelodeon approved new seasons; Nickelodeon renewed the series for its second season in December 1993.|$|E

By the time I was ten or eleven he had stepped up his campaign by adding lickings to the regimen. Each Tuesday afternoon he weighed me in, and if the scale read more than it should have, he ordered me {{into his office and}} had me drop my trousers... I dropped <b>my</b> <b>pants,</b> pulled down my undershorts and bent over. Then he went at it with the belt dotted with metal studs he kept reserved for the occasion. Quite dispassionately, without the least display of emotion or loss of self-control, he whacked away until he drew the first drop of blood, and then he stopped. It normally took between twelve and fifteen strokes. As they came down I counted them off one by one and hoped I would bleed early...|$|E

2500|$|Then, Sparks {{was finding}} the {{electronic}} equipment they had adopted {{for their new}} sound, too cumbersome to tour with and {{they returned to the}} more traditional band format for their next three releases. Whomp That Sucker, Angst in <b>My</b> <b>Pants</b> (two tracks from which appear later in the 1983 movie Valley Girl) and In Outer Space. They finally broke into the US singles chart with [...] "Cool Places" [...] from 1983's In Outer Space. The track was a collaboration with the Go-Go's rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Jane Wiedlin, who, at one time, ran her own Sparks fan club, and its success was in part thanks to Los Angeles' KROQ-FM radio station, which hailed them as local heroes. In 1984, the Maels wrote and performed several original songs on the soundtrack for the black comedy teen film Bad Manners (aka: Growing Pains), including the film's title song, [...] "Bad Manners". In 1988, they scored a hit single in France and in Europe with [...] "Singing in the Shower", sung in duet with Rita Mitsouko: the single was produced by Tony Visconti.|$|E
2500|$|After Semi-Toughs {{release in}} 1977, Bert Convy was {{contacted}} {{by a number}} of est followers, as well as by Werner Erhard. [...] After Convy appeared on The Tonight Show and discussed his experiences attending Erhard Seminars Training in preparation for his role as Friedrich Bismark, he received a letter from Erhard stating: [...] "it would be great for us to get together". [...] Of the est seminar itself, Convy recalled that when another attendee complained of a headache during the course, the group leader told him to [...] "experience it", and when another attendee wet his pants, he was told to [...] "experience the warmth". [...] In a scene from the film, a woman exclaims to Friedrich Bismark {{in the middle of a}} seminar: [...] "I peed in <b>my</b> <b>pants</b> and it felt good." [...] During actual filming on Semi-Tough, Convy received a late-night phone call from actress Valerie Harper, known in Hollywood as a devoted student of Werner Erhard. [...] She related to Convy that Erhard was [...] "pleased" [...] with the role, and she wished him success in the film. [...] Convy suspected that her real reason for calling was to subtly pressure him to go easy on his parody of Erhard in the film. Harper is mentioned by name in the completed film.|$|E
2500|$|The Egypt Independent {{reported}} that police forces dragged a protester, stripped him naked, {{beat him up}} with batons, {{and took him to}} a security truck. The incident sparked criticism against the administration of Morsi for tolerating the security force's excessive use of force.

[...] State television {{reported that}} the 48-year-old beaten man, from a police hospital and without a lawyer present, said that the police had in fact saved him from thieving protesters. The man's daughter, who says she was present {{at the scene of the}} attack, said that her father is simply [...] "afraid to talk", while his nephew said [...] "he is lying because there is a lot of pressure on him." [...] In new twist, Hamada Saber finally retracted his earlier testimony: [...] "I told [...] today that [...] shot me in the leg, beat me and dragged me," [...] he said. [...] "When I resisted, they tore off my shirt. After I resisted some more, they tore off <b>my</b> <b>pants</b> and underpants.

I struggled along heroically, my correlations breaking down, my legs tottering under me, my head swimming, my heart pounding, <b>my</b> lungs <b>panting</b> for air.|$|R
5000|$|In the chorus, Sting, {{not knowing}} any other word which would rhyme with [...] "magic," [...] {{used the word}} [...] "tragic."

I think the only word he could come up with, apart from 'tragic', was 'pelagic', which means 'ocean going'.
