40|$|Lung cancer {{diagnosis}} requires biopsy of airway tissue, {{which is}} mostly done by bronchoscopy. Although preoperative CT is available, intraoperatively only 2 D {{information provided by}} the bronchoscopic camera and fluoroscopy is used. But, guidance of the bronchoscope to the target site would highly benefit from knowing the exact 3 D position of the instrument inside the airways. In this paper, we present a system for preoperative planning and intraoperative navigation during bronchoscopy. The preoperative components are automatic bronchial tree segmentation and skeletonization, semi-automatic tumor segmentation and a virtual fly-through simulation for planning purposes. During the intervention, we apply C-arm pose estimation using a <b>marker</b> <b>plate</b> on the patient table to align preoperative CT and intraoperative fluoroscopy. Thus, we can calculate the current 3 D position of the bronchoscope inside the bronchial tree. Evaluation of the system components on patient CT and phantom fluoroscopy images showed promising results with high accuracy and robustness...|$|E

But, offering 3 D instrument localization would enable faster and more accurate guidance of the bronchoscope.

Thus, the 3 D position of the bronchoscope tip inside the bronchial tree can be located and visualized. We developed a <b>marker</b> <b>plate</b> for C-arm pose estimation, which is placed on the patient table. The markers are made of steel and appear in two different shapes: spheres and sticks. Detecting the markers is essential for the C-arm pose estimation method. In this work, we present and evaluate two detection methods for detecting the projected markers on the fluoroscopy images. Tests on cadaver images showed very good results regarding robustness and precision: For circles and lines, 80 % and 85 %, respectively, of all visible markers were detected, whereas only 1 % and 3 %, respectively, of all detected markers were missegmented...|$|E

After determination of the marker positions within the image coordinate system, the image can be transformed to the radiation field coordinate system.

40|$|The {{position}} of the hallucal sesamoids needs {{to be included in}} evaluation of hallux valgus. In order to quan-tify the rotational {{position of}} the hallucal sesamoids, a new weightbearing tangential radiograph was estab-lished by means of a specially designed tangential posi-tioning device. This device has a depression, and a tan-gential radiograph is taken with the metatarsopha-langeal joint at 45 0 dorsiflexion. A lead <b>marker</b> <b>plate</b> is placed on the depression to show the horizontal plane, and the sesamoid rotation angle (SRA) is measured. The SRA is the angle between the tangential line of the most inferior aspect of the medial-lateral sesamoids and the lead marker line. The SRA was compared with values of the four-grade scale and seven-position scale which were measured from the antero-posterior view, with respect to the hallux valgus angle (HVA), by means of conventional methods. Measurements were made of 58 feet in 29 patients with hallux valgus and 64 feet in 32 normal subjects. The SRA showed the highest correlation among the three parameters (r=O. 817). Some cases had a disparity regard-ing the {{position of the}} sesamoids between the tangential view and the AP view due to misclassification on the AP view.

In this study, we demonstrate a method using N-cadherin-based biomimetic substrate to promote the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) - and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) -derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) without exogenous neuro-inductive signals. We showed that substrate-dependent activa-tion of N-cadherin reduces Rho/ROCK activation and β-catenin expression, leading to the stimulation of neurite outgrowth and conversion into cells expressing neural/glial <b>markers.</b> Besides, <b>plating</b> dissociated cells on N-cadherin substrate can significantly increase the dif-ferentiation yield via suppression of dissociation-induced Rho/ROCK-mediated apoptosis. Because undifferentiated ESCs and iPSCs have low affinity to N-cadherin, plating dissoci-ated cells on N-cadherin-coated substrate increase the homogeneity of differentiation by purging ESCs and iPSCs (~ 30 %) from a mixture of undifferentiated cells with NPCs.

Clinical translation of differentiation protocols requires standardization of production procedures, and surface-marker-based cell sorting is considered instrumental for reproducible generation of defined cell products. Here, we demonstrate that integrin-associated protein (IAP) is a cell surface marker suitable for enrichment of hPSC-derived mesDA progenitor cells. Immunomagnetically sorted IAP+ mesDA progenitors showed increased expression of ventral midbrain floor <b>plate</b> <b>markers,</b> lacked expression of pluripotency markers, and differentiated into mature dopaminergic (DA) neurons in vitro. Intrastriatal transplantation of IAP+ cells sorted at day 16 of differentiation in a rat model of PD resulted in functional recovery.

Our aim was to direct differentiation of mouse ESC into pancreatic acinar cells, which play key roles in pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. To that end, ESC were first differentiated as embryoid bodies and sequentially incubated with activin A, inhibitors of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathways, fibroblast growth factors (FGF) and retinoic acid (RA) in order to achieve a stepwise increase in the expression of mRNA transcripts encoding for endodermal and pancreatic progenitor <b>markers.</b> Subsequent <b>plating</b> in Matrigel® and concomitant modulation of FGF, glucocorticoid, and folllistatin signalling pathways involved in exocrine differentiation resulted in a significant increase of mRNAs encoding secretory enzymes and in the number of cells co-expressing their protein products.

In higher plants, the process of cytokinesis is unique, because the separation of the two daughter cells is carried out by de novo vesicular fusion to generate a laterally expanding cell plate. In Arabidopsis thaliana, very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) depletion caused by a mutation in the microsomal elongase gene PASTICCINO 2 (PAS 2) or by application of the selective elongase inhibitor flufenacet altered cytokinesis. Cell plate expansion was delayed and the formation of the endomembrane tubular network altered. These defects were associated with specific aggregation of the cell <b>plate</b> <b>markers</b> YFP-Rab-A 2 a and KNOLLE during cytokinesis. Changes in levels of VLCFA also resulted in modification of endocytosis and sensitivity to brefeldin A.

However, long-term analysis of human iPS cell-derived dopaminergic neurons in primate PD models has never been performed to our knowledge. Here we show that human iPS cell-derived dopaminergic progenitor cells survived and functioned as midbrain dopaminergic neurons in a primate model of PD (Macaca fascicularis) treated with the neurotoxin MPTP. Score-based and video-recording analyses revealed an increase in spontaneous movement of the monkeys after transplantation.

While Nkx 6. 2 is expressed early in a large region of the medial neural plate, Nkx 6. 1 is restricted to a region overlapping with the region of motor neuron formation. By mRNA injection we show that both can inhibit primary neurogenesis as well as expression of intermediate neural <b>plate</b> <b>markers.</b> However, they do not form auto-regulatory loops and fail to induce ectopic motor neurons as they do in the chick. Using morpholino-mediated knockdown in Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis we show that Nkx 6. 1 knockdown results in paralyzed tadpoles.

After 4 th cleavage micromere deletions, the embryos typically displayed weak Endo 16 expression in relatively few cells of the lineages that normally constitute the vegetal plate, while after 5 th and 6 th cleavage micromere deletions the embryos exhibited strong Endo 16 expression in larger fractions of cells belonging to those lineages. When all four micromeres were deleted, the embryos were severely delayed in initiating gastrulation and sometimes failed to complete gastrulation. However, if only one micromere was allowed to remain in situ throughout development, the embryos exhibited strong Endo 16 expression and gastrulation occurred normally, on schedule with controls. Additional measurements showed that these microsurgical manipulations do not alter cleavage rates or generally disrupt embryo organization. These results constitute direct evidence that the micromeres provide signals required by the macromere lineages for initiation of vegetal plate specification. The specification of the vegetal plate is completed in a normal manner only if micromere signaling is allowed to continue {{at least to the}} 6 th cleavage stage...|$|R
40|$|Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a three {{dimensional}} deformity of {{the spine}} that causes abnormal curvatures in the coronal and sagittal planes and abnormal vertebral rotations. The gold standard for diagnosing and tracking the progression of the deformity is {{through the use of}} repeated radiography and a patient can receive upwards of fifteen radiographic series over the course of treatment, which exposes this population to an increased risk of radiation-dependent complications. This thesis presents the necessary calculations and the marker set required to make the motion capture technology a viable alternative to radiographs, in an effort to reduce the patient’s exposure to ionizing radiation. Using retro-reflective <b>markers</b> and force <b>plates,</b> it is possible to determine asymmetries in the frontal and transverse plane, to calculate the balance {{of the spine}}, to replicate common radiographic measures, and to determine the kinematic profiles of the spine for each patient. The results of this work successfully showed that there is a high correlation between the radiographic measures and those calculated using motion analysis technology. When applied clinically, the results from a small set of AIS patients indicated that the motion analysis technology can help describe the underlying spinal and muscular deformities of patients with AIS. This work provides a viable means of reducing the number of radiographs this patient population is subjected to over the course of their non-operative treatment. It also provides a strong foundation for future work on applying motion capture technology to advance scoliosis research...|$|R
40|$|Fulltext embargoed for: 12 months post date of publicationThe {{floor plate}} {{is one of}} the major {{organizers}} of the developing nervous system through its secretion of sonic hedgehog (Shh). Although the floor plate is located within the neural tube, the derivation of the floor plate during development is still debatable and some studies suggest that floor plate cells are specified by Shh in a temporarily restricted window different to neuroepithelial cells. Using human embryonic stem cells (hESC) as a model of neurogenesis, we sought to determine how floor plate cells may be temporarily specified by SHH signaling during human embryogenesis. We found that inhibition of both GSK 3 β and activin/nodal pathways in hESC induces a cellular state of SOX 2 +/PAX 6 - expression, we describe as "pre-neuroepithelial. " Exposure of SHH during this pre-neuroepithelial period causes the expression of GLI transcription factors to function as activators and consequently upregulate expression of the floor <b>plate</b> <b>marker,</b> FOXA 2, while also supressing PAX 6 expression to inhibit neuroepithelial fate. FOXA 2 + cells were able to efficiently generate mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons, a floor plate derivative. Overall, this study demonstrates a highly efficient system for generating floor plate cells from hESC and, most importantly, reveals that specification of floor plate cells is temporally dependent, whereby it occurs prior to the onset of PAX 6 expression, within a pre-neuroepithelial stage.
