2500|$|Regulations and <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> ensure salmon are farmed in a {{sustainable}} manner. The planning and approval process for new salmon farms in New Zealand considers the farm’s potential environmental effects, {{its effects on}} fishing activities (if it is a marine farm), and any possible cultural and social effects. In the interest of fish welfare, a number of New Zealand salmon farming operations anaesthetise salmon before slaughter using Aqui-S™, an organically based anaesthetic developed in New Zealand that is safe for use in food and which has been favourably reported on by the British Humane Slaughter Association.|$|E
2500|$|The {{important}} task of water quality monitoring is shared among MWRI, MoHP and MSEA. Each {{of the three}} Ministries has its own monitoring sites along the Nile and canals. Groundwater quality is monitored exclusively by MWRI. In addition, three institutes within the National Water Research Center monitor water quality. According to a UN report [...] "Despite the multiplicity of (water quality <b>monitoring)</b> <b>programmes,</b> they have sometimes lacked accurate information and have not been linked up". To {{improve the quality of}} monitoring and reporting, Egypt has received support from the Canadian Association for Environmental Analytical Laboratories. Furthermore, a water quality unit has been established, which gathers water quality data from various sections of MWRI and other ministries and collects them in a database with [...] "more than 40 indicators and covering more than 435 sites".|$|E

40|$|The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Devolved Administrations (DA) {{continue}} {{to fund a}} long-running programme Baseline Measurement and Analysis of UK Ozone and UV to monitor column (effectively stratospheric) ozone and surface UV. The main driver for the <b>monitoring</b> <b>programme</b> is the 1985 Vienna Convention on the Protection of the Ozone Layer. The Convention obliges parties (including the UK) to undertake inter alia monitoring, data dissemination and information exchange activities. The current <b>monitoring</b> <b>programme</b> comprises: • measurements of column ozone at two sites in the UK (Lerwick and Reading) • spectrally-resolved UV measurements at one site (Reading) The ozone element of the <b>monitoring</b> <b>programme</b> was reviewed in 2002. Defra has commissioned this review of the programme {{to ensure that it}} continues to meet current and future policy and scientific requirements as well as international obligations. The Review The review was structured in terms of 7 questions, which addressed a range of strategic, technical and organisational aspects of the <b>monitoring</b> <b>programme.</b> 1. How does the <b>monitoring</b> <b>programme</b> help to meet the UK obligations under the Vienna Convention on the Protection of the Ozone Layer? 2. Are the data currently collected in the <b>monitoring</b> <b>programme</b> fit for purpose? If not, what measures could be employed to make the data fit for purpose? Are there any activities in the current <b>monitoring</b> <b>programme</b> which are no longer needed? 3. Are the current measurement techniques viable into the future (over a 5 - 20 year timescale), and what other techniques/instruments are available? 4. Are current methodologies for disseminating information sufficient? If other techniques/instruments are preferable, how (or indeed could) they be introduced whilst maintaining the continuity of the results? 5. Is the current <b>monitoring</b> <b>programme</b> cost effective? 6. Is the current <b>monitoring</b> <b>programme</b> structured for optimum delivery? 7. Should {{all or part of the}} programme be competitively tendered, or indeed should it be competitively tendered at all? Summary of Findings The key findings were 1. The current <b>monitoring</b> <b>programme</b> is working well but it has a low profile and impact 2. There are options to evolve the programme but these require further, more detailed evaluation...|$|R
