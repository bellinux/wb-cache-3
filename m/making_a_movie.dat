5|$|The {{film was}} never meant to be a true biographical film to Ip Man's life, but to broadly touch on the {{elements}} from his life.

While alive, Huang Na had asked that her surname be changed to her stepfather's, so her altar tablet bore the name Zheng Na. The couple decided to focus on raising their remaining child, with Zheng planning to pursue business opportunities in Guangzhou or Shenzhen. In January 2007, Jack Neo considered <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> about the murder, but both families objected.

5|$|The movie {{rights to}} Night of January 16th were {{initially}} purchased by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in October 1934 {{as a possible}} vehicle for Loretta Young. They hired Rand to write a screenplay, but the project was scrapped. After MGM's option expired, Woods considered <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> version through a production company of his own, but in 1938 RKO Pictures bought the rights for $10,000, a fee split between Woods and Rand. RKO considered Claudette Colbert and Lucille Ball as possible stars, but they also gave up on the adaptation. The rights were resold to Paramount Pictures in July 1939 for $35,000. Paramount released a movie in 1941; Rand {{did not participate in}} the production. The film was directed by William Clemens, and Delmer Daves, Robert Pirosh, and Eve Greene were engaged to prepare a new screenplay.|$|E

5|$|Homer and {{his wife}} Marge have three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. As the family's provider, he works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as safety inspector. Homer embodies several American working class stereotypes: he is a crude, bald, obese, short-tempered, neglectful of the rules, clumsy, lazy, heavy drinking, ignorant and idiotic person; however, he is {{essentially}} a decent man and fiercely devoted to his family, often ignoring his own personal interests for those of his family. Examples include working long hours in order to buy Lisa a horse, dealing with Marge's sisters when they come over, moving back to Springfield instead of staying in a job he loves, getting Bart a ride back to Springfield after getting stranded during spring break, going to Lisa's band concerts, and giving up his love of pork chop night {{in order to take}} his family out on town to try something they like. Despite the suburban blue-collar routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going to space, climbing the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> with Mel Gibson, fighting President George H. W. Bush, fighting in professional boxing and earning a shot at the heavyweight title, and winning a Grammy Award.|$|E

500|$|Among Ochs's many admirers {{were the}} short story writer Breece D'J Pancake and actor Sean Penn.

Author Jim Carroll's autobiography, The Basketball Diaries (1978), was dedicated in memory of Phil Ochs. On the cover of The Go-Betweens' The Lost Album, Grant McLennan wore a shirt with the words [...] "Get outta the car, Ochs", a reference to the limousine incident involving Ochs and Dylan. The 1994 film Spanking the Monkey makes reference to Ochs and his suicide. Ochs is mentioned in the Stephen King novels The Tommyknockers and Hearts in Atlantis.|$|E
500|$|Pressman did {{not receive}} any money from Conans box office takings, but he sold the film rights for the Conan {{franchise}} to De Laurentiis for $4.5million and 10percent of the gross of any sequel to Conan the Barbarian. [...] The sale more than paid off his company's debts incurred from producing Old Boyfriends, saving him from financial ruin; Pressman said this deal [...] "made [...] more money by selling out, by not <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie,</b> than [...] ever have made by making one." [...] He also arranged for Mattel to obtain the rights to produce a range of toys for the film. [...] Although the toy company abandoned the license after its executives decided Conan was [...] "too violent" [...] for children, Pressman convinced them to let him produce a film based on their new Masters of the Universe toy line. [...] The eponymous film cost $20million to produce and grossed $17million at the United States box office in 1987.|$|E
500|$|After {{years of}} development, {{a feature film}} {{adaptation}} of The Green Hornet was handled by Rogen and Goldberg, with a theatrical release in January 2011. Rogen chose to do a re-imagining of the title character. He was {{executive producer of the}} movie and also cast himself as the main character. Rogen later admitted to having been overwhelmed by handling its $120million budget. [...] "It's insane. But it's not so much the specific amount of money that's stressful, it's all the things that go along with <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> of that size." [...] The actor also went on a strict weight-loss diet to play the slim crime fighter. The Green Hornet was a critical disappointment; Adam Graham of the Detroit News called it [...] "a big, sloppy, loud, grating mess of a movie" [...] and the Arizona Republics Bill Goodykoontz found its story to have fallen apart. Nonetheless it still opened at number one at the box office, making $33million in its opening weekend before going on to gross more than $225million.|$|E

500|$|The {{score of}} Sense8 was {{composed}} by Johnny Klimek and Tom Tykwer; {{the two had}} previously co-composed the score for Cloud Atlas and had a minor contribution in the soundtrack of The Matrix Revolutions as part of Pale 3. Responsible for the orchestration was their fellow Cloud Atlas collaborator Gene Pritsker, and the recording {{was done by the}} MDR Leipzig Radio Symphony Orchestra. Each season's score was written up to {{a year and a half}} before filming began, enabling the production to play it back to the actors before shooting a scene. Tykwer, who has made the music for all of his movies this way, introduced to the Wachowskis the concept of first writing the music during pre-production of Cloud Atlas and the sisters have since commented they are not <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> again a different way. Once a first cut is completed by the editors, the composers do further developing of their tracks. [...] "We flesh things out; both expand and refine, write new material and even change direction if it is prudent", the composers have explained.|$|E
500|$|Commentators {{attempted}} {{to tie the}} characters in the song to specific people in Dylan's personal life in 1965. In his book , Andy Warhol recalled that some people in his circle believed that [...] "Like a Rolling Stone" [...] contained hostile references to him; he was told, [...] "Listen to 'Like a Rolling Stone'—I think you're the diplomat on the chrome horse, man." [...] The reason behind Dylan's alleged hostility to Warhol was supposedly Warhol's treatment of actress and model Edie Sedgwick. It has been suggested that Sedgwick is the basis of the Miss Lonely character. Sedgwick was briefly involved with Dylan in late 1965 and early 1966, around which time there was some discussion of the two <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> together. According to Warhol's collaborator Paul Morrissey, Sedgwick may have been in love with Dylan, and was shocked when she found out that Dylan had secretly married Sara Lownds in November 1965. However, in The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia, Michael Gray argues that Sedgwick had no connection with [...] "Like a Rolling Stone", but states [...] "there's no doubt that the ghost of Edie Sedgwick hangs around Blonde on Blonde".|$|E
500|$|When {{comparing}} work on Batman Forever, Chris O'Donnell, who portrayed Robin, explained, [...] "It {{just felt}} like everything got a little soft the second time. On Batman Forever, I felt like I was <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie.</b> The second time, I felt like I was making a kid's toy commercial." [...] He also complained of the Robin costume, saying it was more involved and uncomfortable {{than the one he}} wore in Batman Forever, with a glued-on mask which caused sweat to pool on his face. According to John Glover, who played Dr. Jason Woodrue, [...] "Joel [...] would sit on a crane with a megaphone and yell before each take, 'Remember, everyone, this is a cartoon'. It was hard to act because that kind of {{set the tone for the}} film." [...] Production designer Barbara Ling admitted her influences for the Gotham City design came from [...] "neon-ridden Tokyo and the Machine Age. Gotham is like a World's Fair on ecstasy." [...] Rhythm and Hues and Pacific Data Images created the visual effects sequences, with John Dykstra and Andrew Adamson credited as the visual effects supervisors.|$|E
