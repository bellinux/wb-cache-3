40|$|Semi-dry grasslands in the European Alps {{have been}} {{increasingly}} fragmented {{over the last}} 150 years. Few studies have investigated the implications of landscape configuration for genetic structure and gene flow among remnant habitat patches. Conservation management of semi-dry grassland plants rarely accounts for possible effects of major landscape elements, such as forest patches, as barriers to gene flow and dispersal via seed and pollen, despite their potential importance for biodiversity conservation. Using 1416 individuals from 61 sampling sites across 2 valleys in South-Eastern Switzerland and Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprints, we applied a spatial strip and a circle approach to determine the impact of different landscape elements on genetic differentiation in the semi-dry grassland herb Trifolium montanum (<b>mountain</b> <b>clover).</b> Overall genetic differentiation among sampling sites was low (overall F ST = 0. 044).

In the event that additional amounts are needed, re-isolation of compounds will be performed for expanded biological testing. Initial ex vivo biological testing of D. ornata extracts have demonstrated anthelmintic activity towards the hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum. The World Health Organization projects that one billion individuals are currently infected with hookworms or related soil-transmitted, parasitic nematodes.

40|$|The Wells 6. 0 {{magnitude}} earthquake of February 21, 2008, {{occurred on}} a previously unrecognized northeast-striking southeast-dipping fault situated beneath Town Creek Flat, {{a few miles}} north of Wells, Nevada. Focal depth of the earthquake was 5 miles (8 km). Bedrock geology in the surrounding ranges did not indicate the existence of the fault prior to the earthquake, and no surface rupture has been observed related to the earthquake. Faults with a similar trend and attitude had not been observed in the southern Snake Mountains. Correlation of the earthquake fault to structures south of Wells that bound the East Humboldt Range and Clover Hill is plausible. High-angle northwest-trending faults in the southern Snake Mountains and Windermere Hills, adjacent to the earthquake foci, may have been responsible for partitioning aftershocks. This fault, referred to as the Wells earthquake fault (WEF), is an approximately 55 ° southeast-dipping normal fault (Smith and others, this volume). Its dip direction is opposite to that of most recognized Cenozoic (Neogene) high-angle faults in the immediate vicinity that are related to uplift of the Snake Mountains and Windermere Hills northwest and northeast of Wells, respectively. The geometry of the WEF was resolved by Smith and others (this volume) based on 3 -D resolution of the main earthquake and subsequent aftershocks. The bedrock geology of the southern Snake <b>Mountains,</b> Windermere Hills, <b>Clover</b> Hill and northern East Humboldt, and Wood Hills, which bound the earthquake area, provided no suggestions that a fault, especially one capable of producing a large earthquake, was present at the surface location of the WEF. Attitudes of bedding-parallel faults and of stratigraphic units in the southern Snake Mountains are roughly parallel to the WEF, and thus, following the earthquake, it was initially postulated {{that there might be a}} relationship between the two. However, this does not appear to be the case. Rather, the earthquake fault may be related to a system of east-dipping normal faults south of Wells that bound the eastern flanks of the Ruby Mountains, East Humboldt Range, an...|$|R
40|$|The role of low-angle faults in {{accommodating}} extension {{within the}} upper crust remains controversial because {{the existence of}} these faults markedly defies extant continuum theories of how crustal faults form, and once initiated, how they continue to slip. Accordingly, for many proposed examples, basic kinematic problems like slip direction, dip angle while active, and magnitude of offset are keenly debated. A well-known example is the Miocene Mormon Peak detachment and overlying Mormon Peak allochthon of southern Nevada (USA), whose origin and evolution have been debated for several decades. Here, we use geologic mapping in the Meadow Valley Mountains to help define the geometry and kinematics of emplacement of the Mormon Peak allochthon, the hanging wall of the Mormon Peak detachment. Pre-exten­sion structural markers, inherited from the east-vergent Sevier thrust belt of Meso­zoic age, are well suited to constrain the geometry and kine­matics of the detachment. In this study, we add to these markers a newly mapped Sevier-­age monoclinal flexure preserved in the hanging wall of the detachment. The bounding axial surfaces of the flexure can be readily matched to the base and top of the frontal Sevier thrust ramp, which is exposed in the footwall of the detachment to the east in the Mormon Mountains and Tule Springs Hills. Multiple proxies for the slip direction of the detachment, including the mean tilt direction of hanging wall fault blocks, the trend of striations measured on the fault plane, and other structural features, indicate that it is approximately S 77 °W (257 °). Given the observed structural separation lines between the hanging wall and footwall, this slip direction indicates 12 – 13 km of horizontal displacement on the detachment (14 – 15 km net slip), lower than a previous estimate of 20 – 22 km, which was based on erroneous assumptions in regard to the geometry of the thrust system. Based on a new detailed map compilation of the region and recently published low-temperature thermochronologic data, palinspastic constraints also preclude earlier suggestions that the Mormon Peak allochthon is a composite of diachronously emplaced, surficial landslide deposits. Although earlier suggestions that the initiation angle of the detachment in the central Mormon Mountains is ∼ 20 °– 25 ° remain valid, the geometry of the Sevier-age monocline in the Meadow Valley Mountains and other structural data suggest that the initial dip of the detachment steepens toward the north beneath the southernmost <b>Clover</b> <b>Mountains,</b> where the hanging wall includes kilometer-scale accumulations of volcanic and volcaniclastic strata...|$|R
