5|$|These GTPases {{regulate}} cell <b>motility,</b> {{proliferation and}} {{also contribute to}} tumor progression and invasion. In many cell types, NEDD9 overexpression increases spreading and crescent morphology (an indicator of high <b>motility).</b> However, in fibroblasts, some work has found that absence of NEDD9 leads to more rapid focal adhesion turnover, which led to increase of migration in NEDD9-/- compared to wild type.|$|E
5|$|Amphetamine {{stimulates the}} {{medullary}} respiratory centers, producing faster and deeper breaths. In {{a normal person}} at therapeutic doses, this effect is usually not noticeable, but when respiration is already compromised, it may be evident. Amphetamine also induces contraction in the urinary bladder sphincter, the muscle which controls urination, which can result in difficulty urinating. This effect {{can be useful in}} treating bed wetting and loss of bladder control. The effects of amphetamine on the gastrointestinal tract are unpredictable. If intestinal activity is high, amphetamine may reduce gastrointestinal <b>motility</b> (the rate at which content moves through the digestive system); however, amphetamine may increase <b>motility</b> when the smooth muscle of the tract is relaxed. Amphetamine also has a slight analgesic effect and can enhance the pain relieving effects of opioids.|$|E
5|$|Flagella are rigid protein structures, about 20nanometres in {{diameter}} and up to 20micrometres in length, that are used for <b>motility.</b> Flagella are driven by the energy released by the transfer of ions down an electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane.|$|E
40|$|During development, infants garner {{knowledge}} about their environment {{and their own}} body through explorative behaviours mediated by changing <b>motilities.</b> A key question regards infants ability to transfer knowledge between these various <b>motilities.</b> There is currently little consensus in the literature. In depth perception studies, for example, Adolph showed that knowledge amassed while sitting {{does not appear to}} transfer to crawling, and that information collected during crawling does not transfer to walking. In contrast, Witherington and colleagues reported findings suggesting that there is transfer from crawling to walking. Here, we attempt to reconcile the two findings by suggest- ing, with a simulation, that a key experimental difference could explain the disparity between these studies. The results suggest that an infant lacking transfer between <b>motilities,</b> as suggested by Adolph, can behave in ways consistent with the findings of Witherington and colleagues, and an empirical prediction is derived that could be tested in real experiments. This study highlights the potential importance of learning specificity in development, a concept that could have important implications for developmental robotics...|$|R

We further enhanced these protocols by changing their routing information exchange intervals; MOD AODV, MOD DSR and MOD FSR.

40|$|Background: Ocular <b>motilities</b> play a {{major role}} when reading for the {{continuous}} acquisition and updating of visually presented information. Accurate oculomotor control is required to be able to learn how to read and to efficiently read to learn. This process requires accurate decoding accomplished by precise oculomotor control. Aim: A comparison of the prevalence of poor ocular <b>motilities</b> between mainstream and learning-disabled schools were explored from three different schools; one mainstream and two disabled schools. One hundred and ninety-two children, age range 8 – 13 years (mean = 10. 30, s. d. : ± 0. 999) in grades 3 and 4, with 112 children from the two learning-disabled schools and 80 children from the mainstream school participated in the study. Method: The standardised direct observation test, using the Northeastern State University College of Optometry scoring criteria, was used to evaluate saccadic and pursuit eye movements. Fixation maintenance was evaluated using the Southern California College of Optometry scoring criteria. The Gulden fixation stick with a 6 / 24 letter E was used as a fixation target. Results: The results showed that children from the learning-disabled schools appeared to have a higher incidence of poor saccadic accuracy compared with children from the mainstream school. No significant associations in both the mainstream and the learning-disabled children were found for head movements, pursuits and fixation ability. However, the results suggest a statistically significant association between poor saccadic accuracy and children from the learning-disabled schools. Conclusion: This study provides further evidence for a link between poor saccadic accuracy and children from the school of the learning disabled.

In vitro, the sliding motion of microtubules (rail) can be reproduced on a kinesin (motor protein) -coated surface coupled with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis, which is called a "motility assay". Based on this technique, a method was recently established to form MT assemblies by an active self-organization (AcSA) process, in which MTs are crosslinked during a sliding motion on a kinesin-coated surface.
