[...] Royal Navy personnel worked alongside RAF crew at Benson to build experience during the transition. A £454m Merlin Life Sustainment Programme will see 25 HC3/3A airframes fitted with the cockpit electronics of the HM2, folding tails and main rotor heads, strengthened landing gear, deck lashing mounting points, obsolescence updates, fast-roping points and a common emergency egress system. The first HC4 is to begin flight trials in September 2017, with an IOC in mid-2018; an interim folding <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>head</b> will be fitted to some HC3 for shipborne operations prior to the HC4 upgrade. [...] Command of the UK Merlin HC3/3A fleet was formally transferred from the RAF to the Royal Navy during a ceremony at RAF Benson on 30 September 2014. [...] As part of the same ceremony, the RAF's 78 Sqn was disbanded and the Royal Navy's 846 Naval Air Squadron stood-up with the Merlin. [...] The RAF's 28(AC) continued to operate as part of the Commando Helicopter Force until July 2015, when 28(AC) Sqn stood down and 845 Naval Air Squadron stood-up. 846 NAS relocated from RAF Benson to RNAS Yeovilton in March 2015, with 845 NAS following in June 2016.|$|E

It {{is powered by}} a 25 h. p. air cooled two-cylinder Westlake engine. As such it represents one of the largest RPH's in the world. It was purchased from Gorham Model Products in 1992 to provide a suitable rotor craft research flight test platform for the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the Naval Postgraduate School. The helicopter was delivered disassembled and was accompanied by an ample supply of replacement and spare parts. Also included was a second helicopter in a partially assembled condition that had been previously flown. Assemblies provided comprised the chassis, <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> transmission, <b>rotor</b> <b>head</b> assembly and tailboom with tail rotor gear box and rotor. The task undertaken by this thesis was to fabricate one complete fully operable RPH and to design, fabricate and install whatever new assemblies that were required for its NPS mission and to make up for deficiencies in the previous design. The work completed required: (1) Design, fabrication and installation of a new skid-type landing gear system; (2) Redesign, and incorporation of a new engine mount system; (3) Modification of the engine and <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> transmission coupling; (4) Upgrade of the electrical system and elongation of the nose section; and (5) Initial engine testing.

50|$|HM-15 was {{the first}} {{squadron}} to load two MH-53Es into a U.S. Air Force C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft. To do so, all seven blades and the <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>head</b> is removed, the tail folded, and the helicopter inched slowly into the cabin.

A new design of all plastic rotor blades, which can sustain hits from 30 mm shells, has been installed on the Mi-28N Night attack variant.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} fuselage is {{a simple}} open frame with a seat mounted on it. Its two coaxial, contra-rotating two-bladed rotors have diameters of 4 m. The <b>main</b> <b>rotors</b> are both of fixed pitch design, with no articulation in any axis. Steering is accomplished by pivoting the <b>rotor</b> <b>head</b> on a gimbal using a control handle, {{in a similar manner}} to a weight shift hang glider. Climb and descent is controlled by increasing and decreasing the throttle. The aircraft lacks a tail rotor as the coaxial, contra-rotating <b>main</b> <b>rotors</b> produce zero net torque. Yawing motion is produced and controlled by electronic gyroscopically-controlled differential electric braking of the <b>main</b> <b>rotors.</b> With its empty weight of 70 kg and a gross weight of 220 kg the H-4 has a useful load of 150 kg.

50|$|The EC120B Colibri is a {{single-engine}} multimission helicopter, {{designed for}} safe, simple, and cost-effective operations. It incorporates several of Eurocopter's trademarked technologies, those of prominence are the Speriflex <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>head</b> and the eight bladed fenestron anti-torque tail rotor; {{these have been}} partially credited with contributing to the rotorcraft's noise signature, which is 6.7 decibels below International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) limits. Airbus Helicopters has claimed that the EC120 B possesses the lowest operating cost in its class. As of 2014, the EC120 has {{the distinction of being}} the only single-engine rotorcraft to be certified to JAR/FAR 27 standards; measures incorporated to meet these standards include an energy-attenuating main structure, energy-absorbent seats for all on board, and a crash-resistant fuel system.|$|E
50|$|Like the {{preceding}} LZ-1 through LZ-4, the LZ-5 utilized designer Glidden Doman's unorthodox gimbaled <b>rotor</b> <b>head</b> system, which featured {{the elimination of}} rotor hinges and dampers and included blades of soft-in-plane dynamic design. The servo control system was entirely contained within the <b>rotor</b> <b>head,</b> with no external oil tanks or plumbing. The tail rotor was also hingeless and free floating to eliminate stresses in rapid tail rotor turns. In other ways it had a conventional helicopter <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> and tail rotor configuration. The pilot and co-pilot were seated over the engine, {{which was in the}} nose, and a six-passenger compartment was located behind them. The engine was cooled by exhaust ejectors, producing an energy saving that increased payload by 800 pounds. The aircraft featured wheeled quadricycle undercarriage, the main units of which carried dual wheels.|$|R
50|$|A {{helicopter}} swashplate {{is a pair}} of plates, one rotating and one fixed, {{that are}} centered on the <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> shaft. The rotating plate is linked to the <b>rotor</b> <b>head,</b> and the fixed plate is linked to the operator controls. Displacement of the alignment of the fixed plate is transferred to the rotating plate, where it becomes reciprocal motion of the rotor blade linkages. This type of pitch control, known as cyclic pitch, allows the helicopter rotor to provide selective lift in any direction.|$|R
50|$|The <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> {{is mounted}} in the {{midsection}} of the fuselage, consisting {{of a total of}} five blades. From 1994 through 2001, the deputy chief engineer of CAIC, Mr. Li Meng (李萌) led the team to successfully develop the <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> for Z-10, winning two patents in the process. The <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> blade, Type 95KT composite rotor blade was a top priority of the 8th 5-yr plan that first began in that era, {{and it was one of}} the ten critical technologies of Z-10. China never had such advanced technology and Mr. Li Meng had to lead his team to develop it on their own, and finished the job ahead of schedule. The early successful completion not only enabled Z-10 to fly a full year ahead of the schedule, but Type 95KT blades have also been widely used afterward in new helicopters and upgrading old helicopters. Spheriflex <b>Rotor</b> <b>Head</b> is the type which Z-10 used with flaw damage tolerant design, lowest vibration level in its class even at high speed, easy maintenance, excellent manoeuvrability and stability.|$|R
50|$|A {{decision}} to redesign the <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>head</b> resulted in considerable delays {{to the flight}} testing program; during this time, other changes {{were made to the}} rotorcraft, included the horizontal stabilizer being extended and improvements of the hydraulic systems. In 2002, the first production model SW-4, which was equipped with the Rolls-Royce engine, was approaching receipt of certification from the Polish civil aviation authority. Certification for use in other markets is to be made upon customer request. On 1 October 2002, serial production of the SW-4 formally began. On 27 September 2007, type certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) was received. Following on from the certification of the Rolls-Royce model, PZL Swidnik pursued a separate re-certification for a modified SW-4 fitted with a Pratt & Whitney Canada PW200 powerplant as an alternative option.|$|E

50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{significant}} feature of the Bo 105 is its rotor blades and <b>rotor</b> <b>head.</b> The <b>rotor</b> system is entirely hingeless, the <b>rotor</b> <b>head</b> consisting of a solid titanium block to which the four blades are bolted; {{the flexibility of the}} rotor blades works to absorb movements typically requiring hinges in most helicopter rotor designs. The rotor blades are made from reinforced-plastic glass-fiber composite material; the flexibility of the <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> allows for active elements other than rotor pitch changes to be removed, greatly simplifying maintenance and extending blade lifespan. The reliability of the advanced rotor system is such that, in over six million operating hours across the fleet, there were a total of zero failures (as of 1991). The rigid rotor blade design adopted on the Bo 105 has been partially responsible for the type's agility and responsiveness; it remained an uncommon feature on competing helicopters throughout the Bo 105's production life.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} two {{approaches}} are investigated {{to reduce the}} parasite drag of a helicopter. The first approach is to optimize {{the surface of the}} fuselage back door. This is done by applying an automatic, adjoint-based optimization chain; developed by DLR for these purposes. This optimization chain combines the RANS-solver TAU with a solver for the discrete adjoint equation and a conjugate-gradient based optimization algorithm. The parameterization is done by Free Form Deformation. A description of the functionality of the chain is given, before the results of the optimization run are presented. The resulting surfaces were able to bring benefits, up to 3. 75 % drag reduction compared to the baseline geometry. The second approach is to reduce the <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>head</b> drag, by installing a hub fairing. During this investigation, two different hub geometries were tested. By using a fully closed fairing, a drag reduction of about 19 % could be achieved...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the comprehensive approach followed to design, implement and test an innovative sensor system {{aimed at the}} in-flight estimation of the helicopter main rotor state. This activity represents a fundamental step of MANOEUVRES, a project carried on {{in the framework of}} Clean Sky Green Rotorcraft 5 research programme, which is aimed at developing an integrated system capable of informing the pilot of the real-time noise generation and of suggesting possible corrective actions for low-noise maneuvering. The main rotor state {{is one of the most}} impacting factors on the helicopter noise generation, and cannot be measured with conventional rotorcraft instrumentation. The stereoscopic vision-based measurement system described in this paper overcomes this limitation, allowing the running estimation of the main rotor blade attitude in terms of lag, flap and pitch angles. Furthermore, such a sensor system could allow the implementation of enhanced attitude control laws based on rotor state feedback.
