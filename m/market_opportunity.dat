5|$|On 28 June, the Scandinavian Airlines {{route from}} Molde to Bergen {{was taken over}} by Widerøe. However, while Scandinavian Airlines {{previously}} flew from Molde at 06:45, Widerøe's first flight departed at 08:55. Krohn Air stated that it saw this as a <b>market</b> <b>opportunity</b> to provide a business service from Molde to Bergen. Krohn Air had just bought a Jetstream 32 from Sun-Air, which it planned to use on a new route from Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget to Trondheim. However, after Widerøe stated that it would start that route in 2011, Krohn Air changed their plans and announced that the aircraft would instead be used on the route from Molde to Bergen. The Bergen service was started on 31 August. On 7 September, the airline announced it would start services from Molde to Stavanger Airport, Sola on 13 August. Because there were few passengers, the services to Bergen and Stavanger were terminated from 19 November 2010.|$|E

The women make joint and sequential decisions about school attendance, work, marriage, fertility and welfare participation. We use the model to perform a set of counterfactual simulations designed to shed light on three questions: (1) How much of observed minority-majority differences in behavior can be attributed to differences in labor <b>market</b> <b>opportunities,</b> marriage <b>market</b> <b>opportunities,</b> and preference heterogeneity?

25|$|Two {{well known}} local musicians {{conceived}} and {{helped build the}} arena, Chas Chandler and his business partner Nigel Stanger, together with invaluable help from local Price Waterhouse Corporate Finance partner John Wall. The NYSE listed Ogden Corporation was awarded a 20-year contract in February 1995 to design the arena, and once completed, to manage the facility including booking and promotion. According to Ogden, the arena clearly filled a <b>market</b> <b>opportunity</b> for touring acts who had otherwise bypassed the area, with the next nearest local venue being the 2,000 seat Newcastle City Hall, and the only other medium-sized venues being {{as far away as}} Sheffield to the south or Glasgow to the north.

25|$|The {{aerospace}} industry of the UK is the second- or third-largest national {{aerospace industry}} in the world depending upon the method of measurement and has an annual turnover of around £30 billion. In 2016, the global <b>market</b> <b>opportunity</b> for UK aerospace manufacturers {{over the next two}} decades was estimated to be £3.5 trillion. The wings for the Airbus A380 and the A350 XWB are designed and manufactured at Airbus UK's world-leading Broughton facility, whilst over a quarter of the value of the Boeing 787 comes from UK manufacturers including Eaton (fuel subsystem pumps), Messier-Bugatti-Dowty (the landing gear) and Rolls-Royce (the engines).

25|$|Eero Saarinen and his Detroit-based firm were {{commissioned}} in 1955 {{to design the}} TWA Flight Center. Saarinen, who projected a high patronage for the terminal, conceived the terminal to speed up processes. At the same time, the bird-shaped, emblematic construction featured a harmoniously coordinated interior and references to TWA’s corporate identity and thus served to convey the company’s image. Saarinen planned {{the appearance of the}} building from a purely formal perspective mainly to exploit market opportunities. Thus, the TWA Terminal represents an entirely different approach than the thin concrete shells constructed at the same time. The terminal was built to span a space with a minimum of material. Saarinen, who was known as an indefatigable architect, indicated to his client that he needed more time, then took another year to resolve the design. The airline, with the support of Saarinen’s wife Aline, exploited the new <b>market</b> <b>opportunity</b> to carry out a most successful marketing campaign starting with the building's first public presentation on November 12, 1957. The completed terminal was dedicated May 28, 1962, the same year that Saarinen won the AIA Gold Medal posthumously, having died in 1961.|$|E

Starting from scratch against such a dominant competitor was daunting though, so Alliance looked for an acquisition. The natural choice was Bally Gaming International, the number two player with a 15 to 20 percent share.|$|E

2500|$|The Fiero was {{conceived}} as a small, two-seat sports car with all new suspension and V6 engine. While General Motors management and accountants were opposed to investing in a second two-seater sports car that might compete with the Corvette, they perceived the oil crisis as a <b>market</b> <b>opportunity</b> for a fuel-efficient sporty commuter car.

2500|$|In 1939, the SLCC placed F-M [...] {{engines in}} six {{streamlined}} railcars, which are {{known today as}} the FM OP800. In 1944, F-M began production of its own [...] yard switcher, the H-10-44. Milwaukee Road #760 (originally delivered as #1802), the first Fairbanks-Morse locomotive constructed in their own plant, is now preserved and {{on display at the}} Illinois Railway Museum. F-M had yet to produce a railroad road locomotive, or any locomotive prior to the 1944 switcher which was built several years after its conception; all other locomotive producers, except for General Motors (and a few others who manufactured small industrial locomotives), were forced by the government to continue to build reciprocating steam locomotives during much of the war. [...] All national locomotive production [...] was subject to strict wartime restrictions regarding the number and type of railroad-related products they could manufacture (the U.S. Government {{in the name of the}} Navy commandeered all F-M O-P production well into 1944). Following World War II, North American railways began phasing out their aging steam locomotives and sought to replace them with state-of-the-art diesel locomotives at an ever-increasing rate due to the impossible economics of steam propulsion. [...] Fairbanks-Morse, along with its competing firms, sought to capitalize on this new <b>market</b> <b>opportunity.</b>|$|E
