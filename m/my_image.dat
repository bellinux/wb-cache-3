Eric Sykes, with whom Terry-Thomas shared a number of screen moments, stated that it was [...] "always the same character and always funny". Andrew Spicer, writing for the British Film Institute, called him [...] "the definitive postwar cad or rotter". Terry-Thomas himself agreed with the view he presented, writing in the 1980s that [...] "T-T with his permanent air of caddish disdain... bounder... aristocratic rogue... upper-class English twit... genuine English eccentric... {{one of the last}} real gentlemen... wet, genteel Englishman... high-bred idiot... cheeky blighter... camel-haired cad... amiable buffoon... pompous Englishman... twentieth-century dandy... stinker... king of the cads...

The lyrics for the first two seasons' theme songs were also initially meant to be gibberish, but after reading the manga Eri Kawai decided to write Japanese lyrics: [...] "I read the original manga and wrote the lyrics, using <b>my</b> <b>image</b> of Neo-Venezia as a starting point.

Fox said she enjoys Nancy's style which has [...] "evolved" [...] as she has [...] "been a Goth, she’s been a New Romantic and now I like to call her Dusty Springfield on acid! It’s a bit Duffy, a bit ’50s-style, and now I’ve got the red hair it gives us more to play with". Fox added that [...] "one of my favourite things about being in a soap for a long time - I do get to change <b>my</b> <b>image</b> a lot". She said that she enjoys the feedback she receives from her style changes and when her latest style was aired and she had [...] "cut it into a short bob, I got so many tweets from people - some negative, but mostly positive thankfully". She said that she would be open to changing her image in future. Fox has also commented on Nancy's large tattoo on her back, which she deemed to be [...] "too masculine". Fox said that when she was initially on the serial she found it [...] "great to be different" [...] but felt that it was difficult playing the [...] "alternative" [...] character of Nancy when her colleagues were such [...] "gorgeous, glamourous women". The tattoo has since disappeared. Of the character's dress sense the Hollyoaks wardrobe department said [...] "Nancy Hayton has a unique distinctive look on Hollyoaks.
