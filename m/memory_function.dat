Thirty-one adults with ADHD treated with MPH, 36 adults with ADHD not-treated with MPH, and 36 healthy individuals were assessed on several aspects of memory, including short-term memory, working memory, retrospective memory, prospective memory, and source memory. Multivariate statistical analyses were applied to compare <b>memory</b> <b>functions</b> between groups.

40|$|AbstractBackground & aimsBlood {{aspartate}} aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels {{are the most}} frequently reliable biomarkers of liver injury. Although AST and ALT play central roles in glutamate production as transaminases, peripheral blood levels of AST and ALT have been regarded only as liver injury biomarkers. Glutamate is a principal excitatory neurotransmitter, which affects <b>memory</b> <b>functions</b> in the brain. In this study, we investigated the impact of blood transaminase levels on blood glutamate concentration and memory. MethodsPsychiatrically, medically, and neurologically healthy subjects (n= 514, female/male: 268 / 246) were enrolled in this study through local advertisements. Plasma amino acids (glutamate, glutamine, glycine, d-serine, and l-serine) were measured using a high performance liquid chromatography system. The five indices, verbal memory, visual memory, general memory, attention/concentration, and delayed recall of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised were used to measure <b>memory</b> <b>functions.</b> ResultsBoth plasma AST and ALT had a significant positive correlation with plasma glutamate levels. Plasma AST and ALT levels were significantly negatively correlated with four of five <b>memory</b> <b>functions,</b> and plasma glutamate was significantly negatively correlated with three of five <b>memory</b> <b>functions.</b> Multivariate analyses demonstrated that plasma AST, ALT, and glutamate levels were significantly correlated with <b>memory</b> <b>functions</b> even after adjustment for gender and education. ConclusionsAs far as we know, {{this is the first}} report which could demonstrate the impact of blood transaminase levels on blood glutamate concentration and <b>memory</b> <b>functions</b> in human.

2500|$|The {{protective}} effects of apomorphine {{were tested in}} mouse models with mutations in genes related to AD, such as the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene, which is implicated in amyloid molecule build-up. [...] Apomorphine was seen to significantly improve <b>memory</b> <b>function</b> through the increased successful completion of the Morris Water Maze. [...] The levels of the aberrant proteins that lead to neuronal disruption were also tested in the brains of mice. [...] Treatment was seen to decrease the intraneuronal levels of the more aggressive Aβ42 molecule {{when compared to the}} control mice. [...] This result is consistent with the finding that another protein linked to AD, tau protein, was seen to decrease with apomorphine treatment. [...] Apomorphine was shown to promote Aβ degradation and inhibit formation through its anti-oxidative properties. Moderate doses were shown to provide the improvements while overuse provided no benefits and may even cause toxicity.|$|E
2500|$|Several studies {{indicate}} that methylmercury is linked to subtle developmental deficits in children exposed in-utero such as loss of IQ points, and decreased performance in tests of language skills, <b>memory</b> <b>function</b> and attention deficits. Methylmercury exposure in adults has also been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease including heart attack. [...] Some evidence also suggests that methylmercury can cause autoimmune effects in sensitive individuals. Despite some concerns {{about the relationship between}} methylmercury exposure and autism, there are few data that support such a link. Although {{there is no doubt that}} methylmercury is toxic in several respects, including through exposure of the developing fetus, there is still some controversy as to the levels of methylmercury in the diet that can result in adverse effects.

2500|$|There are {{two points}} in rodent brain {{development}} during which treatment with choline, a neurotransmitter, produces lifelong enhancement of spatial memory. [...] The first point is at 12–17 days into embryo development, {{and the second}} is between 16–30 days after the rat has been born. Baby rats, from mothers fed a diet lacking in choline during these two periods of pregnancy, have poorer <b>memory</b> <b>function</b> than baby rats from mothers who received choline. Choline, when given during these critical periods, causes a major improvement in memory performance when rats are being trained in a maze. Even in older rats, these memory changes persist and can be used to easily identify which rats came from mothers that received enough choline. Supplementation with choline appears to reduce the speed at which memory declines with age. Choline before pregnancy is also related to changes in the birth, death, and migration of cells in the hippocampus during the development of the baby rats in the womb. Choline is also associated with the different location and shape of neurons involved in memory storage within the brain.|$|E

2500|$|Tobacco {{and alcohol}} {{are the most}} common {{substances}} that elderly people get a dependence on or misuse. The next-most-common substance that elderly people develop a drug dependence to or misuse is benzodiazepines. Drug-induced cognitive problems can have serious consequences for elderly people and can lead to confusional states and [...] "pseudo-dementia". About 10% of elderly patients referred to memory clinics actually have a drug-induced cause that most often is benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines have also been linked to an increased risk of road traffic accidents and falls in the elderly. The long-term effects of benzodiazepines are still not fully understood in the elderly or any age group. Long-term benzodiazepine use is associated with attentional and visuospatial functional impairments. Withdrawal from benzodiazepines can lead to improved alertness and decreased forgetfulness in the elderly. Withdrawal led to statistical significant improvements in <b>memory</b> <b>function</b> and performance related skills in those having withdrawn successfully from benzodiazepines, whereas those having remained on benzodiazepines experienced worsening symptoms. People having withdrawn from benzodiazepines also felt their sleep was more refreshing, making statements such as [...] "I feel sharper when I wake up" [...] or [...] "I feel better, more awake", or [...] "It used to take me an hour to fully wake up." [...] This suggests that benzodiazepines may actually make insomnia worse in the elderly.|$|E
2500|$|Once neurulation is {{complete}} and {{has given rise}} to the nervous system, fetal memory becomes responsible for a variety of tasks. One of its main functions at this point is to control breathing in the fetus. [...] Also noted, was its ability to control eye movement and coordination during all nine months of development. [...] There is evidence that these are practiced in the womb and carried out similarly after birth. Learning language as an infant also requires fetal memory. It is now known that the mother's voice is clearly heard from inside the womb and that the fetus can differentiate speech sounds, particularly the phonemes (a single segment of sound) in speech. This is evident in the baby when born, showing many signs of early language comprehension. It has also been shown that infants prefer their mother’s native language after being exposed to it in the womb. Evidence also exists that the infant, when born, prefers its mother's smell from having memorized her scent as a fetus. Memory is critical for the recognition process that takes place between the mother and infant through breastfeeding. Breast milk contains contents recognizable by the infant that they were exposed to through amniotic fluid (fluid that encompasses the fetus and is responsible for its nutrition in the womb) in the fetal stage. Since the baby is so dependent upon the mother, maternal nutrition also plays a large role in the infant developing healthy brain functioning; including <b>memory</b> <b>function,</b> which the infant cannot live without. Thus, fetal memory is critical to the survival and healthy development of the infant before and after birth. Many of these functions are measured through methods such as classical conditioning, habituation and exposure learning, being the most popular.|$|E
