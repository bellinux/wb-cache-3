50|$|The highly {{heterogeneous}} {{nature of}} the tumor makes classification particularly difficult especially considering the origins of chondroblastoma. There are two opposing views {{on the nature of}} chondroblastoma, one favoring an osseous origin and the other favoring a cartilaginous origin. The work of Aigner et al suggests that chondroblastoma should be reclassified as a bone-forming neoplasm versus a cartilaginous neoplasm due to the presence of osteoid <b>matrix,</b> <b>type</b> I collagen, and absence of true cartilage matrix (collagen II). However, Edel et al found that collagen II, a marker for mature chondrocytes, was expressed in chondroblastoma, supporting the chondroid {{nature of the}} neoplasm. The results of Romeo and colleagues favor the view of Edel et al of chondroblastoma being cartilaginous in nature but recognize that any definitive determinations regarding the origin of this neoplasm are not possible because of the plasticity of mesenchymal cells when set into different microenvironments and static approaches used in literature. Romeo et al have observed chondroblastoma neoplasms to be composed of mesenchymal cells that have completed normal chondrogenesis along with the production of osteoid and collagen I that could be the result of transdifferentiation of chondrocytes towards osteoblasts.|$|E

40|$|Many {{biodiversity}} conservation strategies aim {{to increase}} species movement {{by changing the}} landscape between suitable areas of habitat. We applied systematic review and meta-analytical methods to robustly assess evidence {{on the impact of}} matrix structure on movement rates, with the hypothesis that movement will be greater through matrix of a more similar structure (vegetation height and cover) to the home habitat. Twenty studies of movement through two or more different <b>matrix</b> <b>types</b> provided 107 effect sizes, expressing the difference between the relative movement rates in different <b>matrix</b> <b>types.</b> The studies were all on animals, including relatively mobile taxa such as birds and butterflies but also rodents and amphibians. We were able to detect that on average, movement was greater through matrix of a more similar structure to the speciesâ�� habitat despite the variation in studies in terms of <b>matrix</b> <b>types,</b> species and methods. The effect size was larger when there was a greater difference {{in the structure of the}} two <b>matrix</b> <b>types</b> being compared (e. g. comparing grassland to forest rather than short grass to long grass). However, there was a high degree of covariation between matrix contrast and studies and other significant subgroupings such as taxonomic group and matrix openness. The biological significance of the increase in movement is not clear; however, ecological theory predicts dispersing individuals are important for population dynamics. Changes to the structure of landscapes intended to improve permeability to movement are supported by the findings of this study, particularly for relatively mobile species. However, research over longer timescales, greater distances and range of taxonomic groups is necessary...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{response}} of species with differing life-history traits to habitat edges and habitat conversion helps predict their likelihood of persistence across changing landscape. In Brazil’s Atlantic Forest, we evaluated frog richness and abundance by breeding guild at four distances {{from the edge of}} a reserve: i) 200 m inside the forest, ii) 50 m inside the forest, iii) at the forest edge, and iv) 50 m inside three different converted habitats (coffee plantation, non-native Eucalyptus plantation, and abandoned pastures, hereafter <b>matrix</b> <b>types).</b> By sampling a dry and a wet season, we recorded 622 individual frogs representing 29 species, of which three were undescribed. Breeding guild (i. e. bromeliad, leaf-litter, and water-body breeders) was the most important variable explaining frog distributions in relation to edge effects and <b>matrix</b> <b>types.</b> Leaf-litter and bromeliad breeders decreased in richness and abundance from the forest interior toward the matrix habitats. Water-body breeders increased in richness toward the matrix and remained relatively stable in abundance across distances. Number of large trees (i. e. DBH 3 ̆e 15 cm) and bromeliads best explained frog richness and abundance across distances. Twenty species found in the interior of the forest were not found in any matrix habitat. Richness and abundance across breeding guilds were higher in the rainy season but frog distributions were similar across the four distances in the two seasons. Across <b>matrix</b> <b>types,</b> leaf-litter species primarily used Eucalyptus plantations, whereas water-body species primarily used coffee plantations. Bromeliad breeders were not found inside any matrix habitat. Our study highlights the importance of primary forest for bromeliad and leaf-litter breeders. We propose that water-body breeders use edge and matrix habitats to reach breeding habitats along the valleys. Including life-history characteristics, such as breeding guild, can improve predictions of frog distributions in response to edge effect and <b>matrix</b> <b>types,</b> and can guide more effective management and conservation actions...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 There is {{increasing}} {{evidence that the}} type of land cover surrounding remnant patches of native habitats (the ‘matrix’) can modify effects of landscape change on biodiversity; thus the traditional idea of dichotomous habitat and non-habitat following island biogeography theory is insufficient in complex landscapes. <b>Matrix</b> <b>type</b> can have dramatic influences on the amount of functional connectivity in a landscape, and some types of land use may conserve connectivity better than others. Evidence is accumulating across multiple systems that pollinator communities and the plants they pollinate and depend upon respond negatively to habitat loss and fragmentation. However, relatively little effort has been devoted to examining the effects of <b>matrix</b> <b>type</b> on pollinator movements. Tropical forest conversion often results in matrix areas of agricultural use, predominantly animal pasture and crop growth. Areas of pasture are vastly different than native forest, both in terms of physical structure and the resources they might provide to native pollinators.

In order to accomplish the research the interplay between the external environment, people working within the <b>matrix</b> <b>type</b> organisation and the <b>matrix</b> <b>type</b> organisation itself were evaluated. These three are collectively known as the ‘Target Operating Model’. Additionally, the environment in which local authorities operate in is becoming more competitive and constricted due to resource deficiencies. The literature identifies tacit knowledge as one the most important components of knowledge and the benefits it can generate for organisations. For instance, competitive advantage is one benefit that local authorities will welcome in today’s competitive environment. The views and opinions of senior managers working within the local authority sector, who contributed to this research highlight many opportunities that exist for transfer of tacit knowledge. The research ascertained that current knowledge management customs are recognised in a humanist paradigm and are associated with information technology. Overall, there is a focus on codifying knowledge and managing explicit knowledge with no regard afforded to tacit knowledge management. Additionally, there is an awareness from senior managers that there are serious consequences with respect to knowledge loss and that a formal knowledge management strategy would be welcome. This study concludes with the identification of opportunities that exist within the matrix organisation at team level and provides tentative suggestions to exploit these opportunities to ensure that tacit knowledge can be transferred where possible...|$|E
