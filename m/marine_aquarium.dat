5|$|Plymouth {{is home to}} the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom (MBA) which conducts {{research}} in all areas of the marine sciences. The Plymouth Marine Laboratory is an offshoot of the MBA. Together with the National <b>Marine</b> <b>Aquarium,</b> the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Sciences, Plymouth University's Marine Institute and the Diving Diseases Research Centre, these marine-related organisations form the Plymouth Marine Sciences Partnership. The Plymouth Marine Laboratory, which focuses on global issues of climate change and sustainability. It monitors the effects of ocean acidity on corals and shellfish and reports the results to the UK government. It also cultivates algae {{that could be used to}} make biofuels or in the treatment of waste water by using technology such as photo-bioreactors. It works alongside the Boots Group to investigate the use of algae in skin care protects, taking advantage of the chemicals they contain that adapt to protect themselves from the sun.|$|E
25|$|Marine fishkeeping is {{different}} from its freshwater counterpart because of the fundamental differences in the constitution of saltwater and the resulting differences in the adaptation of its inhabitants. A stable <b>marine</b> <b>aquarium</b> requires more equipment than freshwater systems, and generally requires more stringent water quality monitoring. The inhabitants of a <b>marine</b> <b>aquarium</b> are often difficult to acquire and are usually more expensive than freshwater aquarium inhabitants. However, the inhabitants of saltwater aquariums are usually much more spectacular than freshwater aquarium fish.|$|E

25|$|In general, <b>marine</b> <b>aquariums</b> {{have more}} complex {{filtration}} requirements than most freshwater aquariums. The various components frequently include {{wet and dry}} filters and protein skimmers. Protein skimmers are devices that remove organic compounds prior to their degradation, and are very useful in <b>marine</b> <b>aquariums.</b> Protein skimming is also used in the popular Berlin method that relies on live rock and periodic partial water changes to degrade and remove waste products. The Berlin method requires large amounts of live rock in the aquarium. The {{rule of thumb is}} 1/2–1nbsp&lb. per 1 US gallon (0.2–0.4nbsp&kg per 4 liters).|$|R
25|$|A <b>marine</b> <b>{{aquarium}}</b> is {{an aquarium}} that keeps marine {{plants and animals}} in a contained environment. Marine aquaria are further subdivided by hobbyists into fish only (FO), fish only with live rock (FOWLR), and reef aquaria. Fish only tanks often showcase large or aggressive marine fish species and generally rely on mechanical and chemical filtration. FOWLR and reef tanks use live rock, a material composed of coral skeletons harboring beneficial nitrogen waste metabolizing bacteria, {{as a means of}} more natural biological filtration.|$|E
25|$|In several Asian countries, Irrawaddy {{dolphins}} {{have been}} captured and trained {{to perform in}} public aquariums. Their charismatic appearance and unique behaviors, including spitting water, spyhopping and fluke-slapping, make them very popular for shows in dolphinariums. The commercial motivation for using this dolphin species is high because it can live in freshwater tanks and {{the high cost of}} <b>marine</b> <b>aquarium</b> systems is avoided. The region within and near the species' range has developed economically; theme parks, casinos and other entertainment venues that include dolphin shows have increased.|$|E
25|$|The live {{rock with}} mantis shrimp burrows are {{actually}} considered useful by {{some in the}} <b>marine</b> <b>aquarium</b> trade and are often collected. It {{is not uncommon for}} a piece of live rock to convey a live mantis shrimp into an aquarium. Once inside the tank, they may feed on fish and other inhabitants. They are notoriously difficult to catch when established in a well-stocked tank, and there are accounts of them breaking glass tanks. While stomatopods do not eat coral, smashers can damage it if they try to make a home within it.|$|E
50|$|The china clam, Hippopus porcellanus, is {{a species}} of bivalve in the Tridacnidae family. It is found in Indonesia, Palau, and the Philippines. It is a popular species for <b>marine</b> <b>aquariums</b> for its {{attractive}} shell.|$|R
50|$|Brooklynella hostilis is a {{parasite}} of marine fish, found in wild fish, farmed fish and <b>aquariums.</b> In <b>marine</b> <b>aquariums,</b> {{it is most}} commonly found in clownfish. It feeds on dead skin cells and can cause severe damage to gills.|$|R
50|$|In fish-only <b>marine</b> <b>aquariums,</b> {{lighting}} is intended only for illumination. Lighting is chosen primarily with aesthetic considerations for optimal viewing of the fish. The {{lighting is}} generally of much lower intensity than {{is used in}} reef aquariums to limit algae growth.|$|R
25|$|Coastal fishing fleets that hunt {{dolphins}} use {{many small}} boats in a coordinated effort. The fishermen bang metal poles {{in the water}} in order to frighten and therefore guide noise-sensitive dolphins toward the shore. A series of nets are then used to corral the dolphins in. Divers and fishermen in boats next lance or cut the throats of the dolphins and haul them away to a nearby shore station for processing. A few dolphins are selected for sale to aquariums and spared for the <b>marine</b> <b>aquarium</b> (dolphinarium) entertainment industry.|$|E
25|$|After the Waterhouse company, {{the pier}} housed a {{succession}} of firms: the Hayden Dock Company, Shepard Line Intercoastal Service, and the Northland Transportation Company, {{as well as the}} Arlington Dock Company. During the 1962 Century 21 Exposition, the World's Fair at what afterwards became Seattle Center, the pier added curio shops, restaurants, fish houses, etc., and ceased to be a transportation hub. Trident Imports, opened on the pier around that time, had a decades-long run of importing everything from rattan furniture from Southeast Asia to chocolate from Belgium. Ted Griffin's Seattle <b>Marine</b> <b>Aquarium</b> was located at the west end of the pier. Its star attraction, Namu the killer whale, died in 1966. The architecture, landscape and urban design firm Mithun completed a renovation of the pier in 2000 and is now housed in {{the second floor of the}} pier shed.|$|E
25|$|Living Coasts, {{a coastal}} zoo owned by Paignton Zoo, {{is built on}} Beacon Quay which has existed since 1680. In 1857 the Bath's Saloons complex {{was built on the}} {{promontory}} overlooking Beacon Cove. This included a ballroom, concert hall and sunlit conservatory and private bathing facilities with, underneath, a large public swimming bath open to the sea. The stone arches of this public bath have been incorporated into the shop at Living Coasts. Development of the site as a marine animal exhibit was first proposed in early 1999 in response to a call from Torbay Council for submissions from interested parties. The project, developed by Kay Elliott architects, included an exhibit to house marine birds, rather than fish, due to the need to avoid duplicating the exhibits at the National <b>Marine</b> <b>Aquarium</b> in Plymouth. The project was subsequently taken on by Paignton Zoo Environmental Park and named Living Coasts.|$|E
50|$|In some areas, {{mangrove}} reforestation and mangrove restoration is also underway. Red mangroves are {{the most}} common choice for cultivation, used particularly in <b>marine</b> <b>aquariums</b> in a sump to reduce nitrates and other nutrients in the water. Mangroves also appear in home aquariums, and as ornamental plants, such as in Japan.|$|R
50|$|In aquariums, E. quadricolor will {{reproduce}} asexually or sexually when {{in proper}} care with supplemented minerals such as iodine and other trace elements, usually purchased as an enrichment cocktail by most home aquarists. E. quadricolor is commonly kept in <b>marine</b> <b>aquariums</b> {{and comes in}} variety of colours, green being the most common.|$|R
50|$|An {{aquarium}} heater is {{a device}} {{used in the}} fishkeeping hobby to warm the temperature of water in aquariums. Most tropical freshwater and <b>marine</b> <b>aquariums</b> are maintained at temperatures that range from 22-30 °C (71-86 °F). The types include glass immersion heaters and undergravel heating. There are also heating mats that may be placed under the aquarium.|$|R
25|$|In 1832, Jeanne Villepreux-Power, a {{pioneering}} French marine biologist, {{became the first}} person to create aquaria for experimenting with aquatic organisms. In 1836, soon after his invention of the Wardian case, Dr. Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward proposed to use his tanks for tropical animals. In 1841 he did so, though only with aquatic plants and toy fish. However, he soon housed real animals. In 1838, Félix Dujardin noted owning a saltwater aquarium, though he did not use the term. In 1846, Anne Thynne maintained stony corals and seaweed for almost three years, and was credited as the creator of the first balanced <b>marine</b> <b>aquarium</b> in London. English chemist Robert Warington experimented with a 13-gallon container, which contained goldfish, eelgrass, and snails, creating one of the first stable aquaria. The aquarium principle was fully developed by Warington, explaining that plants added to water in a container would give off enough oxygen to support animals, so long as their numbers do not grow too large. He published his findings in 1850 in the Chemical Society's journal.|$|E

The Pilgrim Fathers left for the New World in 1620 near the commemorative Mayflower Steps in Sutton Pool. Also on Sutton Pool is the National <b>Marine</b> <b>Aquarium</b> which displays 400 marine species and includes Britain's deepest aquarium tank.|$|E
500|$|The {{reaction}} to the film {{by the general public}} has led to environmental devastation for the clownfish, and has provoked an outcry from several environmental protection agencies, including the <b>Marine</b> <b>Aquarium</b> Council, Australia. [...] The demand for tropical fish skyrocketed after the film's release, causing reef species decimation in Vanuatu and many other reef areas. After seeing the film, some aquarium owners released their pet fish into the ocean, but failed to release them into the correct oceanic habitat, which introduced species that are harmful to the indigenous environment, a practice that is harming reefs worldwide.|$|E
5000|$|The neon dottyback (Pseudochromis aldabraensis) is a fish {{commonly}} kept in <b>marine</b> <b>aquariums.</b> [...] It is the hardier of the non-tank raised pseudochromises. They {{like to stay}} at {{the bottom}} of their tank, so do not be alarmed. They get along extremely well with blue damsels (and other kinds of damselfish). Otherwise, they can be fairly aggressive.|$|R
50|$|The {{blue coral}} {{is the only}} extant Octocoral with a massive skeleton, which is {{composed}} of fibrocrystalline aragonite (calcium carbonate). It is a hermatypic zooxanthellaete species with either blue or grey-grey polyps located within its skeleton, which each contain eight tentacles. Its colonies are either columnar, plates or branched. It is a tolerant species and is used in <b>marine</b> <b>aquariums.</b>|$|R
50|$|Purified {{water is}} used in {{freshwater}} and <b>marine</b> <b>aquariums.</b> Since it does not contain impurities such as copper and chlorine, it helps to keep fish free from diseases, and avoids the build-up of algae on aquarium plants due to its lack of phosphate and silicate. Deionized water should be re-mineralized before use in aquaria, since it lacks many macro- and micro-nutrients needed by plants and fish.|$|R
500|$|Michelson {{has engaged}} in <b>marine</b> <b>aquarium</b> design and coral {{propagation}} since 1997 when he designed and built a fully automated marine reef biome, in which he propagated various coral species that he collected himself. [...] He has been a NAUI certified SCUBA diver since 1969, {{and has been a}} recreational diver in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, where he dived on various wrecks and developed methods of collecting and successfully transporting marine invertebrates for propagation. Michelson has also built and flown his own man-rated experimental rotorcraft. N8489B is a single seat gyrocopter for which Michelson is the FAA certified mechanic and pilot.|$|E
