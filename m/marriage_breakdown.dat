5|$|Cynthia {{attributed}} {{the start of}} the <b>marriage</b> <b>breakdown</b> to Lennon's use of LSD, and as a result, she felt that he slowly lost interest in her. When the group travelled by train to Bangor, Wales in 1967 for the Maharishi Yogi's Transcendental Meditation seminar, a policeman did not recognise her and stopped her from boarding. She later recalled how the incident seemed to symbolise the end of their marriage. After Cynthia arrived home at Kenwood, she found Lennon with Ono and left the house to stay with friends. Alexis Mardas later claimed to have slept with her that night, and a few weeks later he informed her that Lennon was seeking a divorce and custody of Julian on grounds of her adultery with him. After negotiations, Lennon capitulated and agreed to let her divorce him on the same grounds. The case was settled out of court in November 1968, with Lennon giving her £100,000 ($240,000 in US dollars at the time), a small annual payment and custody of Julian.|$|E

25|$|Nelson {{was raised}} in South East, Western and Northern Queensland and joined the {{military}} at a young age, serving in the Australian Army as an operational signalman.

The launch of a branch by the right-wing party in liberal Canberra caused controversy, with Nelson claiming of being denied meeting venues before organising its first meetings amid public protests in July. He was subsequently appointed as the inaugural president of the party's ACT branch. Nelson was behind a move to have the party contest the 1998 territory election that was subsequently vetoed by national party president Pauline Hanson.

40|$|In {{nations such}} as Australia and the United States, governments are {{becoming}} increasingly involved in the private sphere as they deal with a rapidly changing social environment. There have been recent shifts in political responses to the social problem of <b>marriage</b> <b>breakdowns.</b> Because approximately fifty per cent of marriages end in divorce, governments are reshaping existing policies to preserve and support marriage. Responding {{to the challenge of}} preventing <b>marriage</b> <b>breakdowns,</b> governments have developed policies and established programs in this usually private arena. This paper examines one {{of the ways in which}} governments are attempting to tackle the problems of <b>marriage</b> <b>breakdowns.</b> In particular, it broadly describes programs designed to strengthen marital relationships by intervention and prevention strategies. Public policies encourage couples to participate in government-sponsored relationship and marriage education services. While private providers such as community groups and the churches often deliver the programs, this strategy indicates that governments are developing political measures and policy ideas about personal responsibility and marriage. The paper suggests that governments are encouraging people to take greater responsibility for their personal relationships, yet at the same time attempting to regulate people’s preparation for marriage...|$|R
40|$|<b>Marriage</b> <b>breakdowns</b> {{and family}} {{instability}} with their debilitating after-effects {{on women and}} children are the hallmark of greatly mechanized global community at present time. To remedy the situation, social scientists have diagnosed a multitude of variables as the precursor for the upward trends in <b>marriage</b> <b>breakdowns</b> and family disintegration. In Malaysian context, women`s financial independence, easy access to multimedia and early marriage are among the factors which account for the rising phenomenon of divorce even {{during the early years}} of marriage among Muslims.   To remedy the situation, marriage counseling, law reform and pre-marriage courses are mostly emphasized by both mainstream legal scholars and women right activists. It is my considered opinion that these formalistic approaches if not integrated with the emphasis on ethical side of Islamic law may cause more marriage breakups than enhancing families.   The bigger issues in terms of ethical management of Muslim family, such as marriage fidelity, sense of commitment to care for women and children, and spousal mutual empathy and responsibility may help a great deal in acculturating our society from early childhood to adolescence and through adulthood. The paper, therefore, argues for the more concentrated ethical approach for addressing the underlying causes of marriage disability in order to give more effect and meaning to the existing formalistic social and legal measures by reforming Muslims` mindset and outlook towards family.

25|$|As {{the show}} progressed into the 1990s, EastEnders still {{featured}} hard-hitting {{issues such as}} Mark Fowler discovering he was HIV positive in 1991, {{the death of his}} wife Gill from an AIDS-related illness in 1992, murder, adoption, abortion, Peggy Mitchell's battle with breast cancer, and Phil Mitchell's alcoholism and violence towards wife Kathy. Mental health issues were confronted in 1996 when 16-year-old Joe Wicks developed schizophrenia following the off-screen death of his sister in a car crash. The long-running storyline of Mark Fowler's HIV was so successful in raising awareness that in 1999, a survey by the National Aids Trust found teenagers got most of their information about HIV from the soap, though one campaigner noted that in some ways the storyline was not reflective of what was happening at the time as the condition was more common among the gay community. Still, heterosexual Mark struggled with various issues connected to his HIV status, including public fears of contamination, a <b>marriage</b> <b>breakdown</b> connected to his inability to have children and the side effects of combination therapies.|$|E
500|$|Hoping {{to divert}} {{herself from the}} grief of Cazale's death, Streep {{accepted}} a role in The Seduction of Joe Tynan (1979) as the chirpy love interest of Alan Alda, later commenting that she played it on [...] "automatic pilot". She performed the role of Katherine in The Taming of the Shrew for Shakespeare in the Park, and also played a supporting role in Manhattan (1979) for Woody Allen. Streep later said that Allen did not provide her with a complete script, giving her only the six pages of her own scenes, and did not permit her to improvise a word of her dialogue. In the drama Kramer vs. Kramer, Streep was cast opposite Dustin Hoffman as an unhappily married woman who abandons her husband and child. Streep thought that the script portrayed the female character as [...] "too evil" [...] and insisted {{that it was not}} representative of real women who faced <b>marriage</b> <b>breakdown</b> and child custody battles. The makers agreed with her, and the script was revised. In preparing for the part, Streep spoke to her own mother about her life as a wife with a career, and frequented the Upper East Side neighborhood in which the film was set, watching the interactions between parents and children. The director Robert Benton allowed Streep to write her own dialogue in two key scenes, despite some objection from Hoffman, who [...] "hated her guts". Jaffee and Hoffman later spoke of Streep's tirelessness, with Hoffman commenting, [...] "She's extraordinarily hardworking, to the extent that she's obsessive. I think that she thinks about nothing else but what she's doing." [...] The film was controversial among feminists, but it was a role which film critic Stephen Farber believed displayed Streep's [...] "own emotional intensity", writing that {{she was one of the}} [...] "rare performers who can imbue the most routine moments with a hint of mystery".|$|E
2500|$|In many soap operas, in {{particular}} daytime serials in the US, {{the characters are}} frequently attractive, seductive, glamorous and wealthy. Soap operas from the United Kingdom and Australia {{tend to focus on}} more everyday characters and situations, and are frequently set in working class environments. Many of the soaps produced in those two countries explore social realist storylines such as family discord, <b>marriage</b> <b>breakdown</b> or financial problems. Both UK and Australian soap operas feature comedic elements, often affectionate comic stereotypes such as the gossip or the grumpy old man, presented as a comic foil to the emotional turmoil that surrounds them. This diverges from US soap operas where such comedy is rare. UK soap operas frequently make a claim to presenting [...] "reality" [...] or purport to have a [...] "realistic" [...] style. UK soap operas also frequently foreground their geographic location as a key defining feature of the show while depicting and capitalising on the exotic appeal of the stereotypes connected to the location. As examples, EastEnders focuses on the tough and grim life in London's east end, while Coronation Street invokes Manchester and its characters exhibit the stereotypical characteristic of [...] "Northern straight talking".|$|E

40|$|Recent policy {{objectives}} surrounding {{the institution of}} marriage are based on strategies aimed at sustaining a stable and morally cohesive society. Policy-makers disapproving of <b>marriage</b> <b>breakdowns</b> often focus on the behaviour of individuals to explain the breakdowns. Policy initiatives seek to 'cure' individuals to overcome the problem of marriage failure. Pre-marriage education programs encourage self-help and depend on individuals solving their own problems. I argue in this paper that this rational view of marriage is flawed because it does not engage with the issue of romance. This is an important concern to administrators because romance often plays a central role in partner choice and people's expectations of marriage. Policy-makers either ignore romance or treat it as a myth to be countered; they rarely discuss how it influences a couple's decision to marry in the first place. I argue that romance should not be dismissed so easily as it plays a significant role in gender relations. Acknowledging romance ought to be a significant part of administering marriage education programs. No Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|Communities {{are faced}} with many social and {{economic}} challenges. One of the social challenges is {{the increasing number of}} vulnerable children mainly as the result of death of one or both parents, extreme poverty, family disharmony, <b>marriage</b> <b>breakdowns</b> and lack of appropriate parental care. This report is centered on the intervention made on the proliferation of vulnerable children but specifically in two main aspects i. e.) Providing opportunities for schooling to vulnerable children aged between 7 and 17 years old, ii) Controlling proliferation of vulnerable children by addressing economic hardships at the households level. The project which this report is all about is being implemented by Himiza Development Group, a Community Based Organization based in Kitunda ward of Dar es Salaam. So far, the outcomes of the project have been:) enrolment of 14 children into formal primary school system, and ii) enrolment of 30 children into vocational training centers. All the 44 children were at one time in the streets of Kitunda doing nothing but some menial jobs. Also, there is a well thought out plan to reach 400 children and empower at least 40 parents and guardians to start income generating projects after accessing loans from Micro Finance Institutions. The roles of the author during implementation of the project have been planning and writing of proposal documents for funding while the CBO leaders have been coordinating and doing the work.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1980 s an export-oriented {{garments}} industry has mushroomed in Bangladesh, with women workers constituting {{a significant proportion}} of its wage labour force. In explaining the reasons for the feminized wage labour force, considerable {{attention has been paid to}} the motivations of employers: the lower cost of young women workers, and their assumed "docility" and "nimbleness" in comparison to men. However, as Nazli Kibria argues, a fuller understanding of the movement of women into the garments factories of Bangladesh also requires the consideration of the "push" factors that underpin it. Conventional understandings of women's entry into wage employment in Bangladesh have emphasized the role played by extreme poverty and the related dynamic of male unemployment and desertion factors that are also explored in the present paper. But based on interviews with women factory workers in Dhaka, the author is able to suggest a more diverse set of factors underpinning their movement into the garments sector, which in a significant number of cases also entails individual rural-urban migration. Among the factors highlighted are family conflicts, <b>marriage</b> <b>breakdowns,</b> problems of sexual harrassment, the pressures from rising dowry demands and uncertain marriage prospects. Rather than being uniformly a response to dire poverty, the paper argues that in some instances garments work provides the means for enhancing personal and/or household economic prospects, while in other cases it provides a measure of economic and social independence for the women concerned. Another point emerging from the paper is that the meanings that are attached to any kind of work are context-specific and thus highly variable: notwithstanding the exploitative nature of work in garments factories, the value that women workers in this particular context attach to garments work needs to be seen in the light of other livelihood options that are open to them, such as domestic service and arduous forms of agricultural wage work...|$|R

25|$|No {{applications}} for dissolution {{may be made}} within one year {{of the formation of}} the civil partnership, except in Scotland.

Also, Section 44 provides that the Court may not make such an order unless the applicant satisfies as to certain facts which are the same as those for divorce under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (MCA), except that adultery cannot be relied on for a civil partnership dissolution: the respondent's behaviour, 2 years' separation and consent, 2 years' desertion or 5 years' separation. If the applicant satisfies the court in this respect, the court must make a dissolution order unless it is not convinced by the evidence that the partnership has indeed broken down irretrievably. The MCA section 5 defence is also available. While adultery cannot be cited as a reason in itself for dissolving a civil partnership, it could be cited as an example of unreasonable behaviour.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Much of the {{literature}} on the relationship between conflict-related trauma and high risk sexual behaviour (HRSB) often focuses on refugees and not mass in-country displaced people due to armed conflicts. There is paucity of research about contexts underlying HRSB and HIV/AIDS in conflict and post-conflict communities in Uganda. Understanding factors that underpin vulnerability to HRSB in post-conflict communities is vital in designing HIV/AIDS prevention interventions. We explored the socio-cultural factors, social interactions, socio-cultural practices, social norms and social network structures that underlie war trauma and vulnerability to HRSB in a post-conflict population. Methods We did a cross-sectional qualitative study of 3 sub-counties in Katakwi district and 1 in Amuria in Uganda between March and May 2009. We collected data using 8 FGDs, 32 key informant interviews and 16 in-depth interviews. We tape-recorded and transcribed the data. We followed thematic analysis principles to manage, analyse and interpret the data. We constantly identified and compared themes and sub-themes in the dataset as we read the transcripts. We used illuminating verbatim quotations to illustrate major findings. Results The commonly identified HRSB behaviours include; transactional sex, sexual predation, multiple partners, early marriages and forced <b>marriages.</b> <b>Breakdown</b> of the social structure due to conflict had resulted in economic destruction and a perceived soaring of vulnerable people whose propensity to HRSB is high. Dishonour of sexual sanctity through transactional sex and practices like incest mirrored the consequence of exposure to conflict. HRSB was associated with concentration of people in camps where idleness and unemployment were the norm. Reports of girls and women who had been victims of rape and defilement by men with guns were common. Many people were known to have started to display persistent worries, hopelessness, and suicidal ideas and to abuse alcohol. Conclusions The study demonstrated that conflicts disrupt the socio-cultural set up of communities and destroy sources of people's livelihood. Post-conflict socio-economic reconstruction needs to encompass programmes that restructure people's morals and values through counselling. HIV/AIDS prevention programming in post-conflict communities should deal with socio-cultural disruptions that emerged during conflicts. Some of the disruptions if not dealt with, could become normalized yet they are predisposing factors to HRSB. Socio-economic vulnerability as a consequence of conflict seemed to be associated with HRSB through alterations in sexual morality. To pursue safer sexual health choices, people in post-conflict communities need life skills. </p...|$|R
