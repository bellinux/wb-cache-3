40|$|This paper {{continues}} an analysis, {{begun in}} the December 2004 issue, that employed panel data to estimate the effects of awareness and political partisanship on post-convention candidate evaluations. The derivation of a theoretical framework was discussed in Part 1 [1]. Empirical results {{using data from the}} US presidential election of 2000 are discussed in the present article. We find that partisans of the opposite party were more resistant to the convention message of Bush than Gore, that awareness played a greater role in determining a predicted post-convention change for Gore, and that Gore’s message was received and accepted at a higher rate than Bush’s message. I. EMPIRICAL RESULTS The dependent variable in the present analysis will be the post-convention feeling thermometer for both candidates and we will use the pre-convention feeling thermometer as an independent variable. Survey Respondents were asked, “On a scale of 0 to 100 how would you rate (Candidate) ? Zero means very unfavorable and 100 means very favorable. Fifty <b>means</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not feel favorable or unfavorable. If you don’t know enough about the person to rate him just let me know. ” Thus, the feeling thermometer is a variable that goes from 0 to 100, and will be treated as an interval variable [2]...|$|E
