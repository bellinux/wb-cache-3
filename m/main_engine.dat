5|$|After each flight {{the engines}} would {{be removed from}} the orbiter and {{transferred}} to the Space Shuttle <b>Main</b> <b>Engine</b> Processing Facility (SSMEPF), where they would be inspected and refurbished in preparation for reuse on a subsequent flight. A total of 46 reusable RS-25 engines, each costing around US$40 million, were flown during the Space Shuttle program, with each new or overhauled engine entering the flight inventory requiring flight qualification on one of the test stands at Stennis Space Center prior to flight.|$|E
25|$|Buran had no main engines; {{take off}} and ascent {{trajectory}} were accomplished with the Energia rocket whose four <b>main</b> <b>engines</b> were expendable. The three Space Shuttle <b>main</b> <b>engines</b> {{were part of the}} orbiter, and were reused for multiple flights.|$|R
50|$|In the Fell locomotive, {{however, the}} four <b>main</b> drive <b>engines</b> {{received}} their charge from Roots blowers driven by two further auxiliary engines which were governed such {{that when the}} traction power demand was more than minimal, they operated at essentially a constant speed. Since a Roots blower is a positive-displacement device, {{this meant that the}} mass flow rate at which charge was delivered to the <b>main</b> <b>engines</b> depended not on the speed of the <b>main</b> <b>engines</b> but on that of the auxiliary engines, so the power output of the <b>main</b> <b>engines</b> was essentially defined by the speed of the auxiliary engines.|$|R

5|$|The T65E1 was {{accepted}} into service as the M19 Gun Motor Carriage in May 1944 with {{an order for}} 904 production models, which was sent to Cadillac. Production did not start until August of that year, and only 285 were produced {{by the end of}} the war. The M19A1 had an auxiliary engine and generator to operate the 40mm guns when the <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> was shut down, and fixtures for carrying two spare gun barrels.|$|E
5|$|While moving {{within the}} cabin, Aldrin accidentally damaged the circuit breaker that would arm the <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> for lift {{off from the}} Moon. There was concern this would prevent firing the engine, {{stranding}} them on the Moon. Fortunately, a felt-tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch. Had this not worked, the Lunar Module circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the ascent engine.|$|E
5|$|After landing, Young and Duke began {{powering}} {{down some of}} the LM's systems to conserve battery power. Upon completing their initial adjustments, the pair configured Orion for their three-day stay on the lunar surface, removed their space suits and took initial geological observations of the immediate landing site. They then settled down for their first meal on the surface. After eating, they configured the cabin for their first sleep period on the Moon. The landing delay caused by the malfunction in the Command/Service Module's <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> necessitated significant modifications to the mission schedule. Apollo 16 would spend one less day in lunar orbit after surface exploration had been completed to afford the crew contingency time to compensate for any further problems and to conserve expendables. In order to improve Young's and Duke's sleep schedule, the third and final moonwalk of the mission was trimmed from seven hours to five.|$|E

5|$|Development {{began in}} 1970, when NASA {{released}} {{a request for}} proposal for 'Phase B' <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> concept studies, requiring development of a throttleable, staged combustion, de Laval-type engine. The request {{was based on the}} then-current design of the Space Shuttle which featured two reusable stages, the orbiter and a manned fly-back booster, and required one engine which would be able to power both vehicles via two different nozzles (12 booster engines with 550,000lbf sea level thrust each and 3 orbiter engines with 632,000lbf vacuum thrust each). Rocketdyne, P and Aerojet General were selected to receive funding although, given P's already-advanced development (demonstrating a working 350,000lbf concept engine during the year) and Aerojet General's prior experience in developing the 1,500,000lbf M-1 engine, Rocketdyne was forced to put a large amount of private money into the design process to allow the company to catch up to its competitors.|$|E
5|$|Each {{engine is}} {{equipped}} with a <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> controller (MEC), an integrated computer which controls all of the engine's functions (through the use of valves) and monitors its performance. Built by Honeywell Aerospace, each MEC originally comprised two redundant Honeywell HDC-601 computers, later upgraded to a system composed of two doubly redundant Motorola 68000 (M68000) processors (for a total of four M68000s per controller). Having the controller installed on the engine itself greatly simplifies the wiring between the engine and the launch vehicle, because all the sensors and actuators are connected directly to only the controller, each MEC then being connected to the orbiter's general purpose computers (GPCs) or the SLS's avionics suite via its own engine interface unit (EIU). Using a dedicated system also simplifies the software and thus improves its reliability.|$|E
5|$|The Bellaire Fire Department {{is housed}} at 5101 Jessamine Street.

The fire department operates the Citizens Fire Academy, a fire and life safety program for Bellaire citizens held on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The old fire station was demolished on December 4, 2009, with demolition continuing on Monday December 7, 2009, and operations are temporarily relocated at the Chevron building.

5|$|The Victor B.2 {{featured}} a distinct {{change in the}} aircraft's engine arrangements; incorporated into the right wing root was a Blackburn Artouste airborne auxiliary power unit (AAPU), effectively a small fifth engine. The AAPU was capable of providing high-pressure air for starting the main engines, and also providing electrical power {{on the ground or}} alternatively in the air as an emergency back-up in the event of <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> failures. The AAPU also acted to reduce the need for external specialist support equipment. Turbine-driven alternators, otherwise known as ram air turbines (RATs), had been introduced on the B.2 to provide emergency power in the event of electrical or hydraulic power being lost. Retractable scoops in the rear fuselage would open to feed ram air into the RATs, which would provide sufficient electrical power to operate the flight controls. In the event of engine flameout RATs would assist the crew in maintaining control of the aircraft until the main engines could be relit.|$|E
5|$|The next day, after final checks were completed, the {{expended}} LM {{ascent stage}} was jettisoned. Because of a failure by {{the crew to}} activate a certain switch in the LM before sealing it off, it initially tumbled after separation and did not execute the rocket burn necessary for the craft's intentional de-orbit. The ascent stage eventually crashed into the lunar surface nearly {{a year after the}} mission. The crew's next task, after jettisoning the Lunar Module ascent stage, was to release a subsatellite into lunar orbit from the CSM's Scientific Instrument Bay. The burn to alter the CSM's orbit to that desired for the subsatellite had been cancelled; as a result, the subsatellite lasted half of its anticipated lifetime. Just under five hours later, on the CSM's 65th orbit around the Moon, its Service Propulsion System <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> was reignited to propel the craft on a trajectory that would return it to Earth. The SPS engine performed the burn flawlessly despite the malfunction that had delayed the lunar landing several days before.|$|E
5|$|The {{third phase}} of the project {{included}} several elements such as a powerful <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> whose propellant was pressure fed, a computer and a unit to measure inertia {{in order to control}} maneuvers. In addition, a long and close range radar system was required to guide the satellite (the system was taken from the Westinghouse radar used in Bomarc surface-to-air missiles), as were lights to illuminate the other satellite, and four cameras for observation. A radiation detector was to be installed to determine if a satellite was carrying either a nuclear weapon or something whose power source involved a radioactive substance. Other sensors included infrared and gravimetric sensors to ascertain the mass of the other satellite, while defensive counter measures would be installed to identify decoys, booby traps, anti-jamming devices, and enemy attack, along with nitrogen cold gas thrusters for orientation.|$|E

5|$|Each Space Shuttle {{had three}} RS-25 engines, {{installed}} in the aft structure of the Space Shuttle orbiter in the Orbiter Processing Facility prior to the orbiter being transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building. If necessary the engines could be changed on the pad. The engines, drawing propellant from the Space Shuttle external tank (ET) via the orbiter's main propulsion system (MPS), were ignited at T−6.6 seconds prior to liftoff (with each ignition staggered by 120ms), which allowed their performance to be checked prior to ignition of the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), which committed the shuttle to the launch. At launch, the engines would be operating at 100% RPL, throttling up to 104.5% immediately following liftoff. The engines would maintain this power level until around T+40 seconds, {{where they would be}} throttled back to around 70% to reduce aerodynamic loads on the shuttle stack as it passed through the region of maximum dynamic pressure, or max Q. The engines would then be throttled back up until around T+8 minutes, at which point they would be gradually throttled back down to 67% to prevent the stack exceeding 3g of acceleration as it became progressively lighter due to propellant consumption. The engines were then shut down, a procedure known as <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> cutoff (MECO), at around T+8.5 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Even before Monitor was commissioned, she ran an {{unsuccessful}} set of sea trials on 19 February. Valve {{problems with the}} <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> {{and one of the}} fan engines prevented her from reaching the Brooklyn Navy Yard from Greenpoint and she had to be towed there the next day. These issues were easily fixed and Monitor was ordered to sail for Hampton Roads on 26 February, but her departure had to be delayed one day to load ammunition. On the morning of 27 February the ship entered the East River preparatory to leaving New York, but proved to be all but unsteerable and had to be towed back to the navy yard. Upon examination, the steering gear controlling the rudder had been improperly installed and Rowland offered to realign the rudder, which he estimated to take only a day. Ericsson, however, preferred to revise the steering gear by adding an extra set of pulleys as he believed it would take less time. His modification proved to be successful during trials on 4 March. Gunnery trials were successfully performed the previous day, although Stimers twice nearly caused disasters as he did not understand how the recoil mechanism worked on Ericsson's carriage for the 11-inch guns. Instead of tightening them to reduce the recoil upon firing, he loosened them so that both guns struck the back of the turret, fortunately without hurting anybody or damaging the guns.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} report, {{it was also}} {{concluded}} that the likely cause for Aiviqs loss of <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> power was sea water in the fuel oil. After the casualty, sea water contamination was found in settling tanks, day tanks, <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> primary filters and <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> injectors. The design of the vessel allowed considerable amount of sea water to enter the stern deck and subsequently to the fuel oil tanks through overflow vents in heavy weather. There were also problems with fuel management practices onboard Aiviq.|$|E

25|$|The X-15 was a {{research}} program and changes were made to various systems {{over the course of}} the program and between the different models. The X-15 was operated under several different scenarios, including attachment to a launch aircraft, drop, <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> start and acceleration, a ballistic flight into thin air/space, re-entry into thicker air, and an unpowered glide to landing. Alternatively, if the <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> was not started the pilot went directly to a landing. The main rocket engine operated only for a relatively short part of the flight, but was capable of boosting the X-15 to its high speeds and altitudes. Without <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> thrust, the X-15's instruments and control surfaces remained functional, but the aircraft could not maintain altitude.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, the RS-68 {{became the}} first large liquid-propellant rocket engine {{designed}} in the U.S. since the Space Shuttle <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> (SSME) in the 1970s. The primary goal for the RS-68 was to reduce cost versus the SSME. Some sacrifice in chamber pressure and specific impulse was made, hurting efficiency; however, development time, part count, total cost, and assembly labor were reduced to {{a fraction of the}} SSME, despite the RS-68's significantly larger size. Typically, the RS-68 runs at 102% rated thrust for the first few minutes of flight, and then throttles down to 58% rated thrust before <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> cutoff. On the Heavy variant, the main CBC's engine throttles down to 58% rated thrust around 50 seconds after liftoff, while the strap-on CBCs remain at 102%. This allows the main CBC to conserve propellant and burn after booster separation. After the strap-on CBCs separate, the main CBC's engine throttles back up to 102% before throttling back down to 58% prior to <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> cutoff.|$|E
25|$|At 19:00 {{overheating}} alarm {{was received}} from the cooling water system of the port <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> and its power had to be reduced to half. At times the engine had to be run at full power for {{short periods of time}} to keep the bow facing the wind. Shortly after 22:00 the speed of the starboard <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> suddenly dropped from 1,000 rpm to roughly 270 rpm, but was restored when the engine was declutched from the shaft. When the second engineer closed the clutch at the normal coupling speed of 400 rpm, the engine stalled. After restarting he attempted coupling the engine again at 1,000 rpm, but it still would not run faster than 270 rpm when connected to the shaft. When the captain received a report that the starboard <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> was no longer usable he decided to abandon the ship and ordered the evacuation of the remaining crew at 22:16. The combination turned parallel to the waves with port side facing the wind and began to drift uncontrollably.|$|E
