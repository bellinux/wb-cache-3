5|$|Nethicite, {{another type}} of magicite, works by {{absorbing}} Mist, thus nullifying the effects of <b>magic</b> <b>and</b> storing vast amounts of power. Nethicite {{can be described as}} either deifacted or manufacted (literally, god-made or man-made). During the course of the game, it is discovered that deifacted nethicite is nethicite created by the Occuria, and that the ultimate source of known pieces of deifacted nethicite is the Sun-Cryst they created. Deifacted nethicite contains a large amount of <b>magic</b> <b>and</b> is known to influence the history of Ivalice.|$|E

It is the sixth installment in the Might <b>and</b> <b>Magic</b> series, the sequel to Might <b>and</b> <b>Magic</b> V: Darkside of Xeen and {{the first of the}} Might <b>and</b> <b>Magic</b> titles to take place in the same world as Heroes of Might <b>and</b> <b>Magic.</b> It continues the storyline of Heroes of Might <b>and</b> <b>Magic</b> II, <b>and</b> takes {{place at the same time}} as Heroes of Might <b>and</b> <b>Magic</b> III in the series chronology.|$|R

5|$|Based on {{architecture}} of the European countries at the Mediterranean Sea, the 1979 planning report for the park suggested it would be home to a shirt and sweater store with the option for screen printed customization, a shop of hats featuring Hanna Barbera characters, a <b>magic</b> <b>and</b> novelty shop, and a store of Mediterranean decorative gifts and jewellery.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy IX {{deviates}} {{from the}} style of customisable characters featured {{in the last two}} titles by reviving the character class concept, which designates a character to a certain role in battle. For example, Vivi is designated as a black mage and is the only character who can use black <b>magic,</b> <b>and</b> Steiner is a knight and is the only character who can use sword skills.|$|E
5|$|Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld was {{reviewed}} by various figures involved in both academia and the Pagan community including Douglas Ezzy and Phil Hine. Greenwood herself {{would go on}} to author several other books on the relationship between <b>magic</b> <b>and</b> anthropology.|$|E

50|$|Multi-genre {{games that}} mix {{elements}} of different genres together. For example, Deadlands presents a Wild West in which elements of horror <b>and</b> <b>magic</b> are prevalent, <b>and</b> Castle Falkenstein presents a Victorian-era world with Jules Verne- and H. G. Wells-inspired technology alongside fantasy elements like <b>magics</b> <b>and</b> the denizens of Faerie.|$|R
50|$|Up until Heroes of Might <b>and</b> <b>Magic</b> V, the Heroes series {{took place}} in the same fictional {{universe}} as the Might <b>and</b> <b>Magic</b> series, <b>and</b> later Might <b>and</b> <b>Magic</b> installments heavily referenced the games, with some taking place in the same world.|$|R

5|$|As Yonah's illness, the Black Scrawl, is terminal, Nier {{sets out}} {{to look for a}} cure. As he does, Nier finds a talking book, Grimoire Weiss, which {{suggests}} that the two team up to use Weiss' <b>magic</b> <b>and</b> to find a cure for Yonah's disease. In their search, they encounter Kainé, a hot-tempered and foul-mouthed swordswoman; and Emil, a blindfolded boy whose eyes petrify anyone they see. After journeying for a time, the village is attacked by a giant shade; the battle culminates in Yonah being carried away by a master Shade that suddenly appears—the Shadowlord—who carries his own book, Grimoire Noir.|$|E
5|$|Chapter seven {{deals with}} conceptions of {{morality}} and ethics, arguing that whereas High Magic typically envisions a dualistic world view of good versus evil, Wicca adheres to a monistic worldview in which malevolence and benevolence are seen as intrinsic parts of the whole. Disagreeing with Luhrmann's view that morality's place in the occult is to hide the pseudo-scientific nature of magic, Greenwood discusses how <b>magic</b> <b>and</b> witchcraft developed in Europe {{as a part of}} moral discourse. She looks at the internal source of morality in High Magic, explaining concepts such as that of the Qliphoth, before examining the internal source of morality in Wicca and Feminist Witchcraft.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Might <b>and</b> <b>Magic</b> series {{ended with}} {{the closure of the}} 3DO Company. The rights to the Might <b>and</b> <b>Magic</b> name were purchased for USD 1.3 million by Ubisoft, who [...] "rebooted" [...] the franchise with a new series with no apparent connection to the previous continuity, starting with the games Heroes of Might <b>and</b> <b>Magic</b> V <b>and</b> Dark Messiah of Might <b>and</b> <b>Magic.</b>|$|R

5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy is menu-based: {{the player}} selects an action {{from a list}} of options such as Attack, <b>Magic,</b> <b>and</b> Item. Battles are turn-based and {{continue}} until either side flees or is defeated. If the player's party wins, each character will gain experience and Gil; if it flees, it will be returned to the map screen; and if every character in the party dies, the game will be over and all unsaved progress will be lost. Final Fantasy was the first game to show the player's characters {{on the right side of}} the screen and the enemies on the left side of the screen, as opposed to a first-person view.|$|E
5|$|English astrology {{had reached}} its zenith by the 17th century. Astrologers were theorists, researchers, and social engineers, {{as well as}} {{providing}} individual advice to everyone from monarchs downwards. Among other things, astrologers could advise on the best time to take a journey or harvest a crop, diagnose and prescribe for physical or mental illnesses, and predict natural disasters. This underpinned a system in which everything—people, the world, the universe—was understood to be interconnected, and astrology co-existed happily with religion, <b>magic</b> <b>and</b> science.|$|E
5|$|Harry Potter is {{a series}} of fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the life of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are {{students}} at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of <b>Magic,</b> <b>and</b> subjugate all wizards and muggles, a reference term that means non-magical people.|$|E

5|$|Hellblazer {{was set in}} a {{contemporary}} world, albeit a world of <b>magic</b> <b>and</b> supernatural conflict behind the scenes. The series is largely isolated {{from the rest of}} the DC Universe, in which the supernatural or paranormal did not play a large role in the lives of most ordinary people, and in Earth-threatening circumstances no superhero interventions were shown or hinted at, suggesting that superheroes no longer existed there. However, some DC Comics characters—most notably the fringe supernatural characters such as Zatanna, The Phantom Stranger, Shade, The Changing Man, Dream of the Endless, and Swamp Thing made appearances.|$|E
5|$|Hibiki is a {{young girl}} with little {{confidence}} in her abilities, except in tea making. When she met Shirotsuki, Hibiki was a shy girl who would hide {{in the corner of}} a room in his house speechlessly. Eventually, Hibiki warmed up to Shirotsuki's affectionate personality and came to consider him a very important person. Hibiki can be very lighthearted, and always helps people who need it. She has no talent for <b>magic,</b> <b>and</b> relies on her master to help her in this regard. She is a crybaby and somewhat clumsy, but does her best and wins people over with her abundant kindness and warm heart.|$|E
5|$|Hibiki meets a hard-to-handle {{student named}} Ahito who hates <b>magic,</b> <b>and</b> {{while he and}} Hibiki are {{eventually}} able to become friends, Ahito continues to hate magic. With {{the help of her}} master, Hibiki creates a homunculus {{in the form of a}} young girl which names herself Shiraasan. While she is hard to keep in line, Hibiki and Shiraasan share a close relationship. Hibiki meets a cursed girl named Nazuna Shireiyu, and Hibiki tries to help alleviate her curse, and in doing so becomes her friend. Nazuna turns out to be the granddaughter of the king of the land where Hibiki's Magic takes place.|$|E

25|$|The next Might <b>and</b> <b>Magic</b> {{game was}} {{released}} in 2002 as Might <b>and</b> <b>Magic</b> IX for Windows. Abandoning the now-dated Might <b>and</b> <b>Magic</b> VI engine {{in favor of the}} Lithtech engine (also used in Legends of Might <b>and</b> <b>Magic),</b> Might <b>and</b> <b>Magic</b> IX was the first game in the series to be rendered entirely in 3D. Unfortunately, the release of the game was rushed, and the finished product was received poorly by critics, who noted the numerous software bugs remaining in the final release, most of which were not fully resolved by the sole patch released before New World Computing's dissolution. The most current game, released by Ubisoft in 2014, is Might <b>and</b> <b>Magic</b> X.|$|R
5|$|In 1982, Ian Gillan {{announced}} the band would fold, as {{he needed to}} rest his damaged vocal cords. The tone and style of his singing changed considerably when he eventually returned. His voice had a more nasal tone and this can be heard on albums he has made from 1983 to the present day. His use of multi-tracked backing vocals also became highly prominent. The rest of the band Gillan, particularly McCoy and Towns, were not happy at the sudden disbanding of the group so soon after the success of <b>Magic,</b> <b>and</b> sued Gillan for royalties.|$|E
5|$|In April 1942, Brigadier General Spencer Akin and his Australian {{counterpart}} at LHQ, Major General Colin Simpson, {{agreed to}} pool their resources {{and establish a}} combined intelligence organisation, known as the Central Bureau. The Australian, British, and US Armies, {{as well as the}} RAAF and the RAN all supplied personnel for this formation, which worked on codebreaking and decrypting Japanese message traffic. This <b>Magic</b> <b>and</b> Ultra intelligence was vitally important to operations in SWPA.|$|E
5|$|In Proto-Indo-European religion, {{the moon}} was personified as the male god *Meh1not. The ancient Sumerians {{believed}} that {{the moon was}} the god Nanna, who {{was the father of}} Inanna, the goddess of the planet Venus, and Utu, the god of the sun. Nanna was later known as Sîn, and was particularly associated with <b>magic</b> <b>and</b> sorcery. In Greco-Roman mythology, the Sun and the Moon are represented as male and female, respectively (Helios/Sol and Selene/Luna); this is a development unique to the eastern Mediterranean and traces of an earlier male moon god in the Greek tradition are preserved in the figure of Menelaus.|$|E
