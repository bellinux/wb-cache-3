40|$|Background: <b>Minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> {{cardiovascular}} <b>procedures</b> {{have been}} progressively used in heart surgery. Objective: To describe the techniques and immediate results of <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> in 5 years. Methods: Prospective and descriptive {{study in which}} 102 patients were submitted to <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> in direct and video-assisted forms. Clinical and surgical variables were evaluated {{as well as the}} in hospital follow-up of the patients. Results: Fourteen patients were operated through the direct form and 88 through the video-assisted form. Between <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> in direct form, 13 had aortic valve disease. Between <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> in video-assisted forms, 43 had mitral valve disease, 41 atrial septal defect and four tumors. In relation to mitral valve disease, we replaced 26 and reconstructed 17 valves. Aortic clamp, extracorporeal and procedure times were, respectively, 91, 6 ± 21, 8, 112, 7 ± 27, 9 e 247, 1 ± 20, 3 minutes in <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> in direct form. Between <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> in video-assisted forms, 71, 6 ± 29, 99, 7 ± 32, 6 e 226, 1 ± 42, 7 minutes. Considering intensive care and hospitalization times, these were 41, 1 ± 14, 7 hours and 4, 6 ± 2 days in <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> in direct and 36, 8 ± 16, 3 hours and 4, 3 ± 1, 9 days in <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> in video-assisted forms procedures...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> are a {{more common}} {{alternative}} {{due to the}} decreased risk of damaging significant muscle tissue. The difference between <b>invasive</b> and <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> spinal surgeries is that <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> involves {{a series of small}} incisions. <b>Minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> can be performed anywhere along the spine, and have been used to treat various abnormalities. The percutaneous pedicle screw fixation technique allows for a procedure that presents minimal risk to the patient. Fluoroscopic image guided navigation through these portals allows for surgeons to perform more efficient <b>procedures.</b> <b>Minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> often yield a much faster recovery time than fully invasive surgeries, making them more appealing to patients. Laminectomies have always been the gold standard when treating lumbar spinal stenosis, but recently, less invasive surgeries have emerged as a safer alternative treatment that helps maintain the postoperative structural integrity of the spine.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{reports on}} {{technology}} developments {{aimed at improving}} {{the state of the}} art for image-guided <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> spine <b>procedures.</b> Back pain is a major health problem with serious economic consequences. <b>Minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> to treat back pain are rapidly growing in popularity due to improvements in technique and the substantially reduced trauma to the patient versus open spinal surgery. Image guidance is an enabling technology for <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures,</b> but technical problems remain that may limit the wider applicability of these techniques. The paper begins with a discussion of low back pain and the potential shortcomings of open back surgery. The advantages of <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> are enumerated, followed by a list of technical problems that must be overcome to enable the more widespread dissemination of these techniques. The technical problems include improved intraoperative imaging...|$|R
25|$|A second {{important}} {{concern is}} the appropriate source of the eggs that are needed. SCNT requires human eggs, {{which can only be}} obtained from women.

25|$|The Ex-Maze is a <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>procedure,</b> first {{reported}} in 2007, that also creates a lesion pattern across both atria epicardially on the beating heart. As with other procedures off-bypass, the surgeon can confirm that AF corrects to normal sinus rhythm during the procedure. Laparoscopic instruments {{are used to}} access the pericardium through the diaphragm. Like many heart-cauterizing instruments, the Ex-Maze device uses heat generated by a radiofrequency coil. The coil is inside a plastic tube that uses suction to maintain contact against the beating heart’s surface.|$|E
25|$|Uterine artery {{embolization}} (UAE) is a <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>procedure</b> {{for treatment}} of uterine fibroids. Under local anesthesia a catheter is introduced into the femoral artery at the groin and advanced under radiographic control into the uterine arterty. A mass of microspheres or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) material (an embolus) is injected into the uterine arteries in order to block {{the flow of blood}} through those vessels. The restriction in blood supply usually results in significant reduction of fibroids and improvement of heavy bleeding tendency. The 2012 Cochrane review comparing hysterectomy and UAE did not find any major advantage for either procedure. While UAE is associated with shorter hospital stay and a more rapid return to normal daily activities, it was also associated with a higher risk for minor complications later on. There were no differences between UAE and hysterectomy with regards to major complications.|$|E

40|$|<b>Minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> in pain {{treatment}} {{are an important}} supplement to conservative pain treatments, to pharmacotherapy {{as well as to}} non-pharmacological procedures when these are insufficient as pain treatments.

40|$|Abstract: During {{the past}} 4 years, some <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> for thyroid and {{parathyroid}} surgery have been described.

The results from <b>minimally</b> <b>invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> are almost comparable with those of conventional surgery, but they have additional advantages in terms of cosmetic result and postoperative pain.
