5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's <b>me</b> <b>looking</b> at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, the British media {{reported}} that she was anorexic, labelling her [...] "Kylie Thinogue". Minogue had been told about the rumours and, as a response, wrote the track [...] "Did It Again". Interviewed by Company magazine that year, she was questioned on her weight and the song, and she explained [...] "It's {{a bit of a}} girl's song, with me telling myself off and never learning my lesson, particularly with men. It's <b>me</b> <b>looking</b> myself in the eye and saying 'You fool, stop being too clever and over-neurotic.'" [...] She had begun writing the song whilst British tabloids published rumors about her private life, and the poor reception that Impossible Princess lead single [...] "Some Kind of Bliss" [...] received. However, she re-wrote the original lyrics with Anderson and Seaman and Minogue said it told a [...] "different meaning". The song discusses telling herself off when she does not learn from her past mistakes. She commented that [...] "Some of the songs from Impossible Princess are close to the heart, but this song was a little voice on my shoulder." [...] The song was originally titled [...] "Clever Girl (Did It Again)".|$|E
500|$|The lyrics for {{the album}} were all written by Radke during his imprisonment. He has {{often called the}} album a breakup record, but with a band and not a girl. Radke said that, [...] "I would think all day, for days and days, [...] what people would want to hear. I would dissect my old album and read all the fan letters and the reasons why they loved my band and why they listened to it. And I wrote about that, but in {{different}} ways. I don’t know why these kids love the tragedies that I write about. I guess they can relate to it." [...] Also on the writing process, Radke said that his lyrics were much more evolved than his past works and that he felt this was a high-point for the post-hardcore genre, owing success to being incarcerated and writing lyrics for two years with no other musical influences. The title, The Drug in Me Is You, came from Radke's experiences concerning his previous self-destructive behavior, which Radke explained that, [...] "We named it that because ... It's <b>me,</b> <b>looking</b> in the mirror, saying, 'I am my own worst [...] I do the worst damage to myself — {{more than anybody else}} can to do me.'" ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic {{stated that}} this episode gave her [...] "hope for this procedural {{that the pilot}} didn't". She called the storyline [...] "heartbreaking", [...] "sad", shocking", and [...] "chilling" [...] and added that there were [...] "plenty of twists and turns that kept me guessing throughout the hour". She was upset that Al Chapman was the murderer, saying {{that it would have}} been [...] "wonderful to see Brian, Linda's bad tempered, control freak of an ex hauled away in cuffs". She added that the look that Eric Singleton gave Detective Baker was [...] "positively evil". She praised the interaction between the Megan and the rest of the main cast, saying, [...] "We got to know more about the cast of characters in Megan's office and Curtis was the standout. Last week Megan questioned Curtis' abilities as a doctor. This week, Curtis not only proved her wrong but turned out to be the much needed comic relief delivering some of the best lines of the night". She finished, [...] ""Letting Go" [...] definitely left <b>me</b> <b>looking</b> forward to what this new hit show has in store for us next". After the ratings for [...] "Pilot" [...] were high, Matt Roush of TV Guide hoped that Body of Proof would [...] "continue to improve" [...] adding that he preferred this episode to [...] "Pilot", despite the lower ratings.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News {{on the set of}} the video shoot, Drake said, [...] "I've shot a lot of videos before, but this is my first attempt to establish myself as Drake the artist." [...] Confronting the criticism of his past videos, notably the one for [...] "Best I Ever Had", Drake said, [...] "I really don't care what other people think about them, they were great experiences for me. I've learned a lot from them", and he explained that he was working on that day with Mandler, someone he respects and looks up to. On the video, Drake said, [...] "We talked colors, we talked epic, emotion-evoking visuals." [...] He called the story of the video interesting and the song tells [...] "sort of a love story". He explained that the video {{has a lot to do}} with his debut album, stating [...] "The album is about finding love, feeling 'Have I sold my soul' as far as 'Will I ever be able to gain the trust of a woman? Will I only be able to be around the dark, evil women? Will I ever find that pure love?' Those elements are in the video." [...] In a separate interview on his Away From Home Tour, with MTV News, Drake said the video takes the song to [...] "another place". He said it offers up a different look to the song. He explained, [...] "This video is what I was really thinking about. The song is like a bad dream — but it's not a bad dream, it's not a terrible dream. It's a little evil. The video really reflects that. It's a struggle between the purities of my past life and what this new life has to offer. Even in the video, you see <b>me</b> <b>looking</b> back and forth between the two and deciding. At the end of the video I don't necessarily make a decision, but when you get the album, you'll see what choice I make." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1947, Wittgenstein {{addressed}} {{a group of}} Oxford philosophers {{for the first time}} at the Jowett Society. The discussion was on the validity of Descartes' Cogito ergo sum where Wittgenstein ignored the question and applied his own philosophical method. Harold Arthur Prichard who attended the event was not pleased with Wittgenstein's methods;Wittgenstein: If a man says to <b>me,</b> <b>looking</b> at the sky, ‘I think it will rain, therefore I exist,’ I do not understand him.Prichard: That’s all very fine; what we want to know is: is the cogito valid or not? ...|$|E

2500|$|Crabb {{has said}} that his early {{experiences}} informed his views on welfare: [...] "The most powerful thing to <b>me,</b> <b>looking</b> back, {{is the way that}} my mother went through a crisis in her life and became welfare dependent. She started working just a few hours each week, increasing her hours and then moving to a position where with extra training she was able to move into full-time work, become a car owner, and reach full economic independence." [...] He also said: [...] "I was brought up in a home where a huge amount of emphasis was put on work...so work and education as routes out of poverty were drummed into us".|$|E

What they did probably sold newspapers, {{but it had a}} devastating effect on my family and my friends. [...] It forced [...] Gene [...] to compose a press release to respond. [...] He said that I had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, had had surgery, and my prognosis was good. [...] The Enquirer doesn't like good news, so the Gilda Radner story stopped running." ...|$|E

2500|$|Frederick Buechner's lifelong {{love affair}} with Bermuda began with his family's escape from the trauma of his father's suicide. [...] In Telling Secrets, Buechner {{described}} [...] "the blessed relief of {{coming out of the}} dark and unmentionable sadness of my father's life and death into fragrance and greenness and light." [...] Bermuda was [...] "a place where healing could happen in a way that perhaps {{would not have been possible}} anywhere else and to a degree that—even with all the endurance, will, courage we might have been able to muster had we stayed —I do not think we could ever have achieved on our own." [...] For a child who had never known familial stability even before his father's death, Bermuda became home. [...] As Buechner explained, [...] "In that never-never land, that Oz of an island, where we had no roots, I found for the first time a sense of being rooted." [...] "All in all it seems to <b>me,</b> <b>looking</b> back, that I lived there with a greater sense of permanence than any place we had lived earlier." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{preparation}} she did for the film, actor Aishwarya Rai {{said in an interview}} that both herself and the director Bhansali [...] ".. just like to walk randomly around the sets and [...] "feel". Sometimes I sit quietly and gaze into space or the ground and he captures all that. In fact, the poster picture with <b>me</b> <b>looking</b> away was taken like that. I was looking at the ground, lost in deep thought and he clicked it and told me that he was putting it on his poster. He knows when I am ready to do a scene, when I am in character, and the like. For instance, I delayed going on the set by two days and he did not say anything. He called me on the set and said we would start shooting in five days. On the second day, I tried hair, make-up, and costume. He told me I was ready to give my first shot and indeed, I was." [...] About the script Bhansali said that he had worked on the script for 18 months and says, [...] "My film is mainstream in terms of budgets, cast and audience and I had to make sure that I did not hurt anyone but evoked a debate." [...] He points out that without star-clout, such themes will not make any impact on the audience or society. [...] "And at least till my screenplay reaches the interval point, I do not start casting my actors." ...|$|E
