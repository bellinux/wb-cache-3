30|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on the max-dmin MIMO {{precoder}} {{in the presence of a}} specific impulsive noise, whose model was obtained thanks to measurements on the antenna dedicated to Global System for Mobile Communications-Railways (GSM-R) situated on the roof of a running train. The measurement campaigns were carried out on trains running at a speed between 160 and 200 km/h. They showed that an intermittent source of electromagnetic interference (EMI) is received by the GSM-R antennas [18]. The EMI is generated by the electric arc emissions due to the sliding contact between the catenary and the pantograph. The variables that influence the electric arc emissions are the contact wire surface conditions, the pantograph sliding contact conditions, the temperature, the train speed, the amplitude of the collected current, the <b>mechanical</b> <b>suspensions</b> reaction, and in general the mechanical characteristics of the catenary system [19].

The results from the simulations are in good agreement with the experimental data, and confirm the observation that the reduced explosion pressure in long slender silos is very sensitive to ignition location.

40|$|The modern-day {{armoured}} fighting vehicles (AFVs) {{are basically}} tracked {{vehicles equipped with}} hydro gas suspensions, in lieu of conventional <b>mechanical</b> <b>suspensions</b> like torsion bar and coil spring bogie suspensions. The uniqueness of hydro gas suspension is that it offers a nonlinear spring rate, which is very much required for the cross-country moveability of a tracked vehicle.

Optimising various design parameters demands innovative design methodologies to achieve better ride performance. Hence, a comprehensive kinematic analysis is needed. In this study, a methodology has been derived to optimise the kinematics of the suspension by reorienting the cylinder axis and optimising the load-transferring leverage factor so that the side thrust on the cylinder is minimised to a greater extent. The optimisation ultimately increases the life of the high-pressure and high-temperature piston seals, resulting in enhanced system life for better dependability...|$|R

50|$|The {{acoustic}} suspension woofer {{provided an}} elegant {{solution to the}} age-old problem of bass distortion in loudspeakers caused by non-linear, <b>mechanical</b> <b>suspensions</b> in conventional loudspeakers. The acoustic suspension woofer (sometimes known as “air suspension”) used the elasticity of air within a small, sealed enclosure of about 1.7 cuft L to provide the restoring force for the woofer cone. The entrapped air of the sealed-loudspeaker enclosure -— unlike the mechanical springs of conventional speakers—provided an (almost) linear spring for the woofer's diaphragm, enabling it to {{move back and forth}} great distances (“excursion”) in a linear fashion, a requirement in the reproduction of deep bass tones. The disadvantage of this arrangement is low efficiency; since the restoring force is large with a large woofer in a small cabinet, the cone must be massive to keep the resonant frequency in the required low bass region. The AR-1s were about a factor of 10 less efficient than other (physically much larger) existing speakers with the same bass response, but since higher power amplifiers were becoming available about the same time, this was a reasonable trade-off to get good bass response from a relatively small speaker.|$|R

The experimental results, obtained in the band 0. 01 ÷ 10 Hz, demonstrate that this sensor has enough dynamics and sensitivity to introduce no limitations to the state-of-the-art control systems.
