40|$|Experiencing <b>malevolent</b> <b>acts</b> is {{a common}} feature when {{conducting}} business {{in parts of the}} developing world, but the effects that these acts have on a firm’s stock price have not received sufficient attention by the literature. Filling the gap, this thesis looks at the oil industry in Nigeria and the effects of multiple <b>malevolent</b> <b>acts</b> over a five year period (ranging from 2006 to 2010) on the stock prices of the four major international oil firms operating therein: Shell, Chevron, Exxon, and Total. The stock price data was presented in the form of abnormal returns, the difference in stock price from the expected price. Ordinary least squares regression as well as Wilcoxian sign-rank techniques were used to test the abnormal returns data for our firms. This data was segregated by firm name as well as by event types to isolate the effects that each has on the returns of the firms under study. This thesis raises several hypotheses, such as that a negative event in general will lead to negative returns and that negative events affecting one firm will lead to positive returns for that firm’s competitors. We managed to determine that the only event types that {{had a significant impact on}} any firm’s returns were kidnappings and government policies (either political or economic) targeted to harm the firms. We discovered that kidnapping events affected Shell’s returns negatively, whereas they have positive impact on the returns of Chevron and Exxon. We postulate that the latter results are a reaction to the relatively strong negative effect on Shell’s returns. In response to negative government actions, Shell and Total experienced positive returns, we postulate that this is due to the market’s perception that these policies will lead to less supply and consequently to higher prices for Nigerian oil. Our results indicate that violent events have no impact, at least on the four major firms, whereas kidnappings and government policies do...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper shares {{extensive}} experience in the practical conduct of effective stakeholder engagement and its application to issues facing the radiological protection profession today. In our current atmosphere of participatory governance, stakeholder engagement is {{a useful tool for}} building partnerships, based upon honesty and trust, between affected and interested parties dealing with radiological protection issues. Key and recurring features of effective stakeholder engagement include: being proactive, open and inclusive, honest, responsive, and transparent using two-way dialogue. Stakeholder engagement can be most beneficial in decision-aiding and decision-making as it leads to informed and sustainable decisions that are able to be implemented because of the broad support created in the process. It is also important, when dealing with issues having radiological protection implications, to establish a multidisciplinary team of professionals (e. g., physicians, agronomists, psychologists, sociologists, senior management, lawyers, law enforcement), as appropriate, to deal with the entire spectrum of issues important to stakeholders. Clear roles, responsibilities and rules for interactions, as well as establishing common goals, will further enhance the probability for successful stakeholder engagement. The radiation protection professional of today and certainly of the future needs new skills to enhance their ability to conduct effective and efficient stakeholder engagement. This paper will also discuss the need to establish these teams and build trusting relationships with stakeholders now so the profession can provide appropriate support for the nuclear renaissance, properly prepare for response to <b>malevolent</b> <b>acts</b> using radioactive material, and effectively deal with other issues facing the radiological protection profession today and in the future...|$|R

There'd be an obituary that would take the guys into a town, they'd do a little research, they'd have a skirmish with the monster, they'd meet a girl, they'd have a showdown with the monster, they'd learn something about themselves, and then they'd roll out of town again.

40|$|One {{year after}} the Fukushima event, the nuclear {{security}} summit in Seoul March 2012, in its final statement, highlights the nexus between safety and security. The safety of operations making use of nuclear or radioactive materials aims at the protection of health and minimization of danger to life and property. Nuclear security aims to prevent and, otherwise, detect and respond to theft, sabotage, unauthorized access, illegal transfer or other malicious acts involving nuclear material, other radioactive substances or their associated facilities. One evident common goal of safety and security is to avoid any contact between the radioactivity and public/environment by accident or incidentally. Synergies between nuclear safety and security at technical level, both for new and existing installations, are therefore possible, at least, in three areas. First, the technologies and design architecture used to ensure nuclear safety can and are also used to ensure security by prevention or mitigation of the consequences from <b>malevolent</b> <b>acts.</b> Second, the techniques and methods developed to ensure protection against ionizing radiation are applicable both to nuclear safety and nuclear security concerns. The third area where synergy between safety and security is evident is the emergency preparedness and response when similar effective procedures {{need to be in}} place irrespectively from the origin of the emergency. The synergy between nuclear safety and security could be sought in two ways – either by identifying/ designing common elements serving both safety and security needs or by adapting available safety technologies to serve security purposes and vise versa. While the first approach is usually applied for new designs, the second one can be applied at all stages of an installation's life time. The Joint Research Centre of the European Commission is leading {{an important part of the}} R&D Euratom Program where safety, security, safeguards and non-proliferation are core areas. JRC has recently demonstrated at a technical level the synergies between safeguards and security and their possible integration allowing better optimization of the resources and important benefit from exchange of experience and expertise between the two systems. In this paper, the focus will be on the technical synergies between safety and security giving some technical examples on the three selected relevant areas. JRC. E. 8 -Nuclear securit...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few years, several {{accidental}} events have highlighted the importance of major manmade hazards, either accidental or deliberate by nature, within chemical and process facilities. Moreover, many plants are located in unstable geo-political areas, where the risk of major accidents triggered by external factors, such as terroristic attacks or sabotages, is not negligible. Hence, intentional risks should be investigated by proper risk assessments, included in the risk picture and reduced by applying adequate security measures. Because of the increased attention for security issues, optimal selection of security measures, by developing and applying economic analyses, may become more important to reduce plants vulnerability towards intentional <b>malevolent</b> <b>acts,</b> as terroristic attacks and sabotages. Despite economic models, such as cost-benefit analysis for supporting the decision-making process, {{have proved to be}} fundamental in many respects with regards to safety, for instance no specific applications of cost-benefit analysis are available in the security domain, within the chemical and process industry context. In this paper, the role of the fundamental terms of cost-benefit analysis within the specific framework of process-industry security is discussed, focusing on the estimation of the threat probability, the assessment of physical security systems costs and performances and the evaluation of the costs of the losses derived from either perspective or retrospective accidental scenarios. Furthermore, a cost-benefit analysis was applied to an illustrative case study, based on a hypothetical sabotage to a storage tank in a process facility, leading to a major accident. The aim of the case study is to prove that the application of cost-benefit analysis provides an economic aid or criterion for selecting additional security measures in a process plant. Starting from a credible sequence of adversary’s actions, the uncertainties related to the threat probability have been accounted and realistic security measures in place have been considered, determining the baseline physical security system performance. Therefore, three pertinent security upgrades have been proposed; for each of them the performances improvement and realistic total costs have been calculated; the losses derived from an expected accidental scenario have been estimated. Then, cost-benefit analysis has been applied proving that it allows defining a rational allocation of security measures. Therefore, we conclude that cost-benefit analysis may offer a relevant support in security risk analysis and its related decision-making process, within the chemical and process industry domain.

40|$|The use {{of nuclear}} power to {{generate}} electricity is very widespread today, with about 20 % of all U. S. electricity coming from the nation's 103 operating reactors. Worldwide there are over 400 commercial nuclear plants that make a similar contribution percentage-wise. However, all of the current U. S. reactors {{and most of those}} elsewhere are relatively old, with no new ones having been started domestically in over two decades and only a few now being built overseas, mostly in Asia. The principal reason for this hiatus in the U. S. is that the cost of electricity from new nuclear plants has been non-competitive with other electricity sources for a long time. The U. S. nuclear-power industry has not been stagnant during this time, however. First, the existing plants themselves are running significantly better than they were twenty years ago, {{to the extent that the}} US. reactor fleet is producing about one-third more electricity annually than it was, due largely to improvements in the capacity factors: the plants run more reliably, shut down less often, and the refueling outages take less than half as long as they once did. The safety performance has also improved dramatically, with major improvements in every one of the main indicators of safety. The security of the plants against sabotage or other <b>malevolent</b> <b>acts</b> has always been very strong, and is stronger still after recent upgrades in response to the September 2001 attacks in New York and Washington. Thus the U. S. nuclear-electricity industry has remained dynamic despite the absence of new construction. The U. S. and foreign companies that design reactors and hope someday to sell more of them have also been actively at work [...] they have developed advanced reactor designs that promise to cost much less to build and to operate, and to have even better safety performance. Several of these advanced designs have received design-certification approvals from the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, meaning that a utility could order one of these certified designs today with confidence that the NRC approval of that design is already in place. These new reactor designs are advanced versions of the existing reactors: broadly similar in their design concept but incorporating important new safety and reliability features and cost-saving features. The term ''evolutionary'' is used to describe these designs, in contrast to several advanced reactor designs whose engineering concepts are very different...|$|R

40|$|A central {{tenet of}} the social {{contract}} is the individual 2 ̆ 7 s obligation to eschew force (with the exception of an inalienable right to self-defence) in return for collective security, with the state holding a monopoly {{on the use of}} force. After centuries of repression and violent conflict 18 th century Enlightenment values sought to fundamentally recast the social contract and redress the power imbalance between the individual and the state. Given the preceding history the state was largely perceived as a <b>malevolent</b> force that <b>acted</b> for narrow interests against the common good. Enlightenment values asserted the pre-eminence of the free, autonomous and self-reliant individual, with the secular state deriving its power/authority/legitimacy through the willing consent of those governed. The question of an appropriate balance between individual rights and social obligations remains a universal quandary. Does a culture that emphasises individual autonomy and self-reliance impact on the broader commitment to a peaceful and harmonious society? Does a libertarian culture inevitably engender some level of mistrust in the state and an associated lack of confidence in collective security? Where self-reliance extends to individual responsibility for personal safety (by providing the individual with the means and authority to resort to force), what are the implications for {{the nature and extent of}} interpersonal violence? For many years the United States has defined itself as an exceptional culturally advanced society that stands as a bastion for liberty against repressive foreign forces. Upholding the citizen 2 ̆ 7 s "natural" right to self-defence by enshrining a right to keep and bear arms in the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution is an integral part of this culture. For the same reasons the United States asserts an absolute right to take pre-emptive military action internationally against foreign adversaries in pursuit of its own self-defence. Domestically there is obvious dissonance between this self-image and the reality of extraordinary levels of interpersonal violence, political polarisation, social alienation and economic inequity. These complex issues are bought into sharp contrast when we try to comprehend why American citizens regularly resort to indiscriminate large-scale violence against innocent civilians (such as mass shootings and occasional bombings). Is it simply because citizens have relatively unrestricted access to the means to effectively undertake such violence, or are there deeper issues about the real level of community commitment to a civilised society...|$|R
