In the <b>mesochronous</b> scheme, pipeline stages operate on multiple data sets simultaneously. The clock period in conventional pipeline scheme {{is proportional to the}} maximum pipeline stage delay while in <b>mesochronous</b> pipelining, it is proportional to the maximum pipeline stage delay difference, which means higher clock speeds are possible and number of pipeline stages is significantly less. In <b>mesochronous</b> approach the clock distribution network is simple and load on it is less resulting in significant power savings. Also, the variations in supply current drawn by clock network is significantly less in <b>mesochronous</b> scheme, thus power supply noise (IR drop and Ldi/dt noise) is less. An 8 × 8 -bit multiplier using carry-save adder technique has been implemented in conventional and <b>mesochronous</b> pipeline approach using TSMC 180 nm (drawn length 200 nm).

Typically, these systems require fully balanced clock distribution trees to enable synchronous communication between all nodes on-chip, resulting in higher power consumption. One approach to reduce power consumption is to replace the balanced clock tree with a globally-asynchronous, locally-synchronous (GALS) <b>mesochronous</b> clocking scheme. NoCs implemented with a GALS clocking scheme, however, tend to have high latencies as packets must be synchronized at every hop between source and destination. In this paper, we propose a novel router microarchitecture for GALS NoCs which offers superior performance versus typical synchronizing router designs. Our approach features Asynchronous Bypass Channels (ABCs) at intermediate nodes thus avoiding synchronization delay. We also propose a new network topology that leverages the advantages of the bypass channel offered by our router design.

For conventional links, these two loops are separate with different performance metrics, resulting in sub-optimal performance. Fractionally spaced equalization (FSE) inherently unifies these two functions, and therefore is proposed for joint equalization and synchronization in this thesis. At the system level, this thesis introduces new adaptation techniques for both <b>mesochronous</b> and plesiochronous applications. For <b>mesochronous</b> systems, the divergence issue of the low-cost sign-sign least-mean-square (SSLMS) adaptive algorithm is solved by using update conditioning to effectively increase the quantization resolution. For plesiochronous systems, a digitally-controlled bit-skipping scheme is proposed for frequency offset compensation. At the circuit level, the voltage-time conversion technique is redesigned to build highspeed, linear and energy-efficient FSE filter taps, which are scalable to advanced technology nodes. All the information is processed by linear current integration, with all integrated currents independent of the channel voltages, avoiding the non-linear voltage-current transformation. Based on different voltage-to-time converter designs, two proof-of-concept FSE implementations have been fabricated in a 90 -nm CMOS process. The first implementation is a 2 -way interleaved 2 -tap FSE, operating at 4. 0 Gb/s, with 2. 0 pJ/bit energy-efficiency and 4. 3 bits of linearity, showing immunity to the sampling phase. Operating at higher rates (6. 25 Gb/s), the second implementation is designed as a 4 -way interleaved 2 -tap FSE with a 1 -tap DFE, which achieves 3. 6 pJ/bit energy-efficiency and over 4. 0 bits of linearity, demonstrating the convergence of the modified sign-sign least-mean-square (M-SSLMS) algorithm.

The key idea is to maintain the functionalities of the original layers, and to improve the performance of architectures by allowing, joint optimization and layer coordinations. In general purpose systems, we address the microarchitectural challenges by codesigning and co-optimizing feature-rich architectures. In application-specific NoCs, we emphasize the event notification, so that the platform is continuously under control. At the network assembly level, this thesis proposes a Hold Time Robustness technique, to tackle the hold time issue in synchronous NoCs. At the network architectural level, the choice of a suitable synchronization paradigm requires a boost of synthesis flow as well as the coexistence with the DVFS.

However, at present, scalability and flexibility are limited by the difficulty to guarantee correct synchronization obtaining high operating frequencies. A trade-off between complexity and operating frequency exists; in fact, while the complexity increases the operating frequency decreases and vice versa. This is mainly due to the difficulty to keep a tolerable skew between the clock signals at the different synchronous units. Such an issue is known as clock skew problem. In addition, {{in order to obtain}} high operating frequencies, regeneration buffers are needed and higher power consumption has to be paid. With the scaling of the integration technology, the clock skew problem is more and more important, and the interconnection delays increase. This drawback, known as wire-delay problem, also limits the performance of the on-chip communication systems and of all the architectures with extensive data-paths. In the last years, the need to interconnect many functional blocks on a single silicon chip obtaining suitable performance, have implied that architectures based on a shared-bus approach have been replaced by more complex systems based on highly hierarchical structures (AMBA bus, STBus, etc.). However, these solutions are not able to provide the scalability and flexibility degrees required by the future systems with hundred of IP-cores. Recently, an architecture based on a packet-switched approach has been proposed as a solution to the above problem. Such systems are known as Network on Chips (NoCs). Even if NoC architectures offer a good scalable solution, the wire-delay still poses some problems in clock generation and distribution in such complex systems. To overcome the clock skew problem, recently <b>mesochronous</b> communication {{systems have been}} proposed. This would enable mitigation of the wire-delay problem simplifying the clock distribution at the back-end phase. This solution does not allow building SoCs with multiple clock domains, but provides an effective solution to fix the clock skew problem. However, existing <b>mesochronous</b> solutions suffer from few problems: high latency, high complexity, clock failure and incompatibility with current design flows. To overcome these limitations, in this dissertation we propose a new <b>mesochronous</b> link architecture, named SKew Insensitive Link (SKIL). Chapter 1 describes technology scaling trends and gives an overview of how scaling affects digital systems performance. Chapter 2 describes NoC – related concepts and terminology and gives an understanding of the new of thinking that NoCs introduce in digital systems design. Some details about STNoC are also given; it is the AST Microelectronics Grenoble approach to NoCs. Chapter 3 describes various synchronization strategies together with their limitations; attention will be focused on synchronization techniques well suited for NoC systems. Chapter 4 is a summary of solutions existent in literature related to synchronization in NoC – like environments. Chapter 5 presents a link model named SKew Insensitive Link (SKIL); this architecture is patent pending on behalf of AST Microelectronics Grenoble. It proves to be as efficient as other solutions but simpler in implementation. Chapter 6 describes some advanced architectural aspects of SKIL. Chapter 7 reports some results about synthesis and simulations of the SKIL module...|$|E
