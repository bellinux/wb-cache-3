40|$|The European XFEL (X-ray Free Electron Laser) {{is a large}} {{facility}} {{under construction}} in Hamburg, Germany. It will provide a transversally fully coherent x-ray radiation with outstanding characteristics: high repetition rate (up to 2700 pulses with a 0. 6 ms long pulse train at 10 Hz), short wavelength (down to 0. 05 nm), short pulse (in the femtoseconds scale), and high average brilliance ($ 1. 6 ⋅ 10 ^{ 25 }$ (photons $s^{− 1 }$ $mm^{− 2 }$ $mrad^{− 2 }$) / 0. 1 % bandwidth). The beam has very high pulse energy; therefore, {{it has to be}} spread out on a relatively long mirror (about 1 m). Due to the very short wavelength, the mirrors need to have a high quality surface on their entire length, and this is considered very challenging even with the most advanced polishing methods. In order to measure the mirrors and to characterize their interaction with the <b>mechanical</b> <b>mount,</b> we equipped a metrology laboratory with a large aperture Fizeau interferometer. The system is a classical 100 mm diameter commercial Fizeau, with an additional expander providing a 300 mm diameter beam. Despite the commercial nature of the system, special care has been taken in the polishing of the reference flats and in the expander quality. We report the first commissioning of the instrument, its calibration, and performance characterization, together with some preliminary results with the measurement of a 950 mm silicon substrate.

40|$|This {{document}} {{describes a}} high-TRL backup {{implementation of the}} anti-coincidence detector for the IXO/XMS instrument. The backup detector, hereafter {{referred to as the}} low-voltage silicon ionization detector (LVSID), has been successfully flown on Astro-E 2 (Suzaku) /XRS and is currently being implemented, without significant changes, on the Astro-H/SXS instrument. The LVSID anti-coincidence detector on Astro-E 2 /XRS operated successfully for almost 2 years, and was not affected by the loss of liquid helium in that instrument. The LVSID continues to operate after almost 5 years on-orbit (LEO, 550 km) but with slightly increased noise following the expected depletion of solid Neon after 22 months. The noise of the device is increased after the loss of sNe due to thermally induced bias and readout noise. No radiation damage, or off-nominal affects have been observed with the LVSID on-orbit during the Astro-E 2 /XRS program. A detector die from the same fabrication run will be used on the Astro-H/SXS mission. The LVSID technology and cryogenic JFET readout system is thus TRL 9. The technology is described in detail in section 2. The IXO/XMS "backup-up" anti-coincidence detector is a small array of LVSID detectors that are almost identical to those employed for Astro -E 2 /XRS as described in this document. The readout system is identical and, infact would use the same design as the Astro -E 2 /XRS JFET amplifier module (19 channels) essentially without changes except for its <b>mechanical</b> <b>mount.</b> The changes required for the IXO/XMS LVSID array are limited to the mounting of the LVSID detectors, and the mechanical mounting of the JFET amplifier sub-assembly. There is no technical development needed for the IXO/XMS implementation and the technology is ready for detailed design-work leading to PDR. The TRL level is thus at least 6, and possibly higher. Characteristics of an IXO/XMS LVSID anti-co detector are given in Table 1 and described in detail in section 3...|$|E

50|$|Successful O-ring joint design {{requires}} a rigid <b>mechanical</b> <b>mounting</b> that applies a predictable deformation to the O-ring.

40|$|In {{this work}} a <b>mechanical</b> optode <b>mounting</b> system for {{functional}} brain imaging with light is presented. The particular application {{here is a}} non-invasive optical brain computer interface (BCI) working in the near-infrared range. A BCI is a device that allows a user to interact with their environment through thought processes alone. Their most common use is as a communication aid for the severely disabled. We have recently pioneered the use of optical techniques for such BCI systems rather than the usual electrical modality [1]. Our optical BCI detects characteristic changes in the cerebral haemodynamic responses that occur during motor imagery tasks. On detection of features of the optical response, resulting from localised haemodynamic changes, the BCI translates such responses and provides visual feedback to the user. While signal processing has a large part to play in terms of optimising performance {{we have found that}} it is the <b>mechanical</b> <b>mounting</b> of the optical sources and detectors (optodes) that has the greatest bearing on the performance of the system and indeed presents many interesting and novel challenges with regard to sensor placement, depth of penetration, signal intensity, artifact reduction and robustness of measurement.
