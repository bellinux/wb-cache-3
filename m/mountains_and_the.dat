5|$|Oklahoma {{has four}} primary {{mountain}} ranges: the Ouachita Mountains, the Arbuckle Mountains, the Wichita <b>Mountains,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ozark Mountains. Contained within the U.S. Interior Highlands region, the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains {{are the only}} major mountainous region between the Rocky <b>Mountains</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Appalachians. A portion of the Flint Hills stretches into north-central Oklahoma, and near the state's eastern border, The Oklahoma Tourism & Recreation Department regards Cavanal Hill as the world's tallest hill; at 1,999feet (609m), it fails their definition of a mountain by one foot.|$|E

5|$|A {{large stone}} {{windmill}} {{was built on}} a hill by late 1686, doubling as a watch tower over the Ottawa River, the Lake of Two <b>Mountains</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mouth of the Des Prairies River. This windmill was like no other in New France (although a similar fortified windmill was later built in Quebec), with thick walls, square loopholes for muskets, with machicolation at the top for pouring lethally hot liquids and rocks onto attackers.|$|E
5|$|At {{the head}} of his army, Simeon I marched from Preslav through the Balkan <b>Mountains</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> valley of the river Tundzha and besieged Adrianople. While the bulk of the Bulgarian forces were {{concentrated}} in Thrace, the Byzantines bribed the Serbian prince Pavle Branović, who was a Bulgarian protégé, to switch sides. The Bulgarians answered with a successful intervention in Serbia, easily gained control of the country and placed in power another Bulgarian candidate, Zaharija Pribisavljević. The conflict in Serbia distracted the Bulgarian military operations against the Byzantine Empire for the rest of 921.|$|E
5|$|Bat Caves Butte and Obsidian Butte formed {{islands in}} the lake when it was full. Relatively {{straight}} northwest-southeast trending eastern shores faced from northwest to southeast the Indio Hills, the Mecca Hills, the Orocopia Mountains, the Chocolate <b>Mountains</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> East Mesa. The less regular western shore faced the Santa Rosa Mountains towards north and the Fish Creek Mountains and Vallecito Mountains farther south. Earlier lake stages may have extended into the Jacumba Mountains as well.|$|E

5|$|Canberra {{is about}} three hours by road from Sydney on the Federal Highway (National Highway 23), which connects with the Hume Highway (National Highway 31) near Goulburn, and seven hours by road from Melbourne on the Barton Highway (National Highway 25), which joins the Hume Highway at Yass. It is a two-hour drive on the Monaro Highway (National Highway 23) to the ski fields of the Snowy <b>Mountains</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Kosciuszko National Park. Batemans Bay, a popular holiday spot on the New South Wales coast, is also two hours away via the Kings Highway.|$|E
5|$|Despite ongoing {{financial}} difficulties, Cerna {{graduated from}} university in 1906. His thesis was passed with a Magna cum laude qualifier. He was by then seriously ill with tuberculosis, and sought {{a change in}} climate. Cerna spent much of this period traveling through the Old Kingdom, and several times visited regions of the Southern Carpathians, in particular the area of Rucăr, the Bucegi <b>Mountains,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Jiu Valley. As Călinescu notes, he had bought himself a horse from a Rucăr local on credit, and failed to deliver the promised sum on time.|$|E
5|$|Many Phellodon {{species are}} {{known from the}} southeastern United States, {{where they have been}} {{extensively}} researched. According to Baird and colleagues, there are nine distinct Phellodon species from Great Smoky <b>Mountains</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> surrounding southern Appalachian Mountains. Three additional species from this area, P.mississippiensis, P.brunneo-olivaceus, and P.fuligineoalbus were added to the genus in 2013–14.|$|E

5|$|Other major streams that drained into Lake Cahuilla were Whitewater River {{from the}} north, and San Felipe Creek and Carrizo Creek from the southwest. More minor {{drainage}} came from Arroyo Salado {{on the western}} shore, and Salt Creek and Mammoth Wash on the eastern shore. Additional unnamed drainages did exist. Drainage from the Chocolate <b>Mountains</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Cargo Muchacho Mountains may have reached the lake but are now buried by the Algodones Dunes. All these water systems are ephemeral.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have shown}} how {{important}} birds are to individual societies, touching on {{all aspects of}} life. In Andean societies such as the Moche (1–800 AD), Nazca (100–700 AD) and Chimu (1150–1450 AD), bright parrot and macaw feathers were traded from the Amazon rainforest to the <b>mountains</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Pacific coast, while guano was collected as a fertiliser, and artists and craftsmen were inspired to create textiles, metal jewellery, and ceramics depicting condors, cormorants, ducks, hummingbirds, owls, vultures, and waders. Their religions, too, endowed birds with symbolic meaning.|$|E

The characteristics of the various faults are difficult to interpret, but they all dip steeply to the north with several thousand feet of displacement.|$|E
5|$|The Ross {{expedition}} was {{a voyage}} of scientific {{exploration of the}} Antarctic in 1839 to 1843, led by James Clark Ross, with two unusually strong warships, HMS Erebus and HMS Terror. It explored {{what is now called}} the Ross Sea and discovered the Ross Ice Shelf. On the expedition, Ross discovered the Transantarctic <b>Mountains</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> volcanoes Erebus and Terror, named after his ships. The young botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker made his name on the expedition.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet era saw drastic {{industrialization}} and militarization of the peninsula. In 1925–1926, significant deposits of apatite {{were discovered in}} the Khibiny <b>Mountains,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first apatite batch was shipped {{only a few years}} later, in 1929. In 1930, sulfide deposits were discovered in the Moncha area; in 1932–1933 iron ore deposits were found near the upper streams of the Iona River; and in 1935, significant deposits of titanium ores were discovered in the area of modern Afrikanda.|$|E

The regiment emplaced {{north and south of}} Chonan attempting to delay the North Koreans in an area where the terrain formed a bottleneck between <b>mountains</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Yellow Sea.|$|E
5|$|The main {{geographical}} {{results of}} the expedition were the discovery of King Edward VII Land; the ascent of the western <b>mountains</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> discovery of the Polar Plateau; the first sledge journey on the plateau; the Barrier journey to a Furthest South of 82°17′S. The island nature of Ross Island was established, the Transantarctic Mountains were charted to 83°S, and the positions and heights of more than 200 individual mountains were calculated. Many other features and landmarks were also identified and named, and there was extensive coastal survey work.|$|E
5|$|The site's value today {{includes}} its {{ecological and}} environmental significance, and its shoreline, {{which is in}} a semi-natural state, {{is part of the}} habitat for the rare map turtle. It is situated between the Lake of Two <b>Mountains</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Senneville Forest ecoterritory, as described in Montreal's Natural Spaces Policy. Therefore, it could be considered part of the wildlife corridor (lien faunique) between the lake and the forest.|$|E
