25|$|Though {{there is}} {{evidence}} that ocular implants have been around for thousands of years modern nonintegrated spherical intraconal implants came into existence around 1976 (not just glass eyes). Nonintegrated implants contain no unique apparatus for attachments to the extraocular muscles and do not allow in-growth of organic tissue into their inorganic substance. Such implants have no direct attachment to the ocular prosthesis. Usually, these implants are covered with a material that permits ﬁxation of the extraocular recti muscles, such as donor sclera or polyester gauze which improves implant motility, but does not allow for direct <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> between the implant and the artiﬁcial eye.|$|E

25|$|In cardiac muscle, beta-catenin forms {{a complex}} with N-cadherin at adherens {{junctions}} within intercalated disc structures, which {{are responsible for}} electrical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling</b> of adjacent cardiac cells. Studies in a model of adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes {{have shown that the}} appearance and distribution of beta-catenin is spatio-temporally regulated during the redifferentiation of these cells in culture. Specifically, beta-catenin is part of a distinct complex with N-cadherin and alpha-catenin, which is abundant at adherens junctions in early stages following cardiomyocyte isolation for the reformation of cell-cell contacts. It has been shown that beta-catenin forms a complex with emerin in cardiomyocytes at adherens junctions within intercalated discs; and this interaction is dependent on the presence of GSK 3-beta phosphorylation sites on beta-catenin. Knocking out emerin significantly altred beta-catenin localization and the overall intercalated disc architecture, which resembled a dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype.|$|E
25|$|Integrated tug barge {{systems are}} {{generally}} {{divided into three}} generations {{by the type of}} coupling. In the first generation systems the tug is connected to the barge by wires or chains. However, because the two vessels are subject to different motion responses due to their shape, displacement and position on a wave, such operation is only possible in calm sea conditions — in rough weather the tug has to disconnect from the barge and continue the journey by towing it in a traditional way. The second generation systems are designed with a deeper stern notch and improved coupling devices to allow operation in heavier seas while still permitting relative motion between the two vessels. The third generation systems such as the Finnpusku system, equipped with rigid or articulated <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupling,</b> allow operation in all sea states and even in ice conditions as the pusher-barge combination behaves hydrodynamically like a conventional ship. However, in some cases the specialized hull form of the pusher, designed to form a streamlined hull when coupled to the barge, might lead to problems with stability and seakeeping when the pusher is operated independently.|$|E

25|$|Finnpusku uses {{a unique}} rigid {{coupling}} system, Wärtsilä Marine Locomotive, {{which consists of}} two hydraulic locking pins, {{one on each side}} of the pusher, and one fixed pin in the bow. When connected, the hydraulic pins exert a transverse force of 450 tons to the sockets, forcing the jaws of the barge apart by , and the angled faces of the coupling pins push the pusher forwards, resulting in a longitudinal force, also of 450 tons, at the bow pin. The three-point connection removes all degrees of freedom and results in the combination behaving hydrodynamically like a single ship, allowing unrestricted service and independent operation in the severe ice conditions of the Gulf of Bothnia. The pusher can be connected to the barge at three different levels, removing the need to ballast the barge to the same draught as the pusher when not carrying cargo.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{investigates the}} {{hypothesis}} that robots based on highly <b>coupled</b> <b>mechanical</b> structures can give rise to redundancy in control. Highly <b>coupled</b> <b>mechanical</b> structures have the property that actuation at one location can translate into movement at multiple locations, and conversely, movement at one location {{can be caused by}} multiple actuators. Due to this property, multiple control strategies may exist for a single behavior. Tensegrity structures which have recently been shown to form the basis for successful locomotor robots [8], have highly <b>coupled</b> <b>mechanical</b> structures. Thus, as a case study, it was of interest to investigate whether these new tensegrity based robots could offer a high degree of redundancy of control. This was investigated on two robots, based on three and four strut tensegrity prisms. Control strategies for locomotion were evolved using a genetic algorithm in simulation, and the evolved behaviors were compared. It was found that multiple control strategies existed for forward locomotion in both structures, and that qualitatively similar behavior could be obtained with significantly different control strategies. This indicated that a considerable degree of redundancy could exist in the control of robots based on highly <b>coupled</b> <b>mechanical</b> structures. I...|$|R
