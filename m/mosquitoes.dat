5|$|Methods used {{to prevent}} malaria include medications, {{mosquito}} elimination and the prevention of bites. There is no vaccine for malaria. The presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density, high anopheles mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from humans to <b>mosquitoes</b> and from <b>mosquitoes</b> to humans. If any of these is lowered sufficiently, the parasite will eventually disappear from that area, as happened in North America, Europe {{and parts of the}} Middle East. However, unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world, it could become re-established if conditions revert to a combination that favors the parasite's reproduction. Furthermore, the cost per person of eliminating anopheles <b>mosquitoes</b> rises with decreasing population density, making it economically unfeasible in some areas.|$|E

5|$|A non-chemical {{vector control}} {{strategy}} involves genetic manipulation of malaria <b>mosquitoes.</b> Advances in genetic engineering technologies {{make it possible}} to introduce foreign DNA into the mosquito genome and either decrease the lifespan of the mosquito, or make it more resistant to the malaria parasite. Sterile insect technique is a genetic control method whereby large numbers of sterile male <b>mosquitoes</b> are reared and released. Mating with wild females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation; repeated releases eventually eliminate the target population.|$|E
5|$|Britain's Sir Ronald Ross, an army surgeon {{working in}} Secunderabad India, proved in 1897 that malaria is {{transmitted}} by <b>mosquitoes,</b> an event now commemorated via World Mosquito Day. He {{was able to}} find pigmented malaria parasites in a mosquito that he artificially fed on a malaria patient who had crescents in his blood. He continued his research into malaria by showing that certain mosquito species (Culex fatigans) transmit malaria to sparrows and he isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of <b>mosquitoes</b> that had fed on infected birds. He reported this to the British Medical Association in Edinburgh in 1898.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to find out {{environmental}} early predictors for <b>mosquito</b> population dynamics. The <b>mosquito</b> dataset consists of a longitudinal sampling of Culex pipiens adult females collected from 2000 to 2011 in Piedmont region, North-western Italy. A series of statistical models were implemented to catch the best environmental predictors for <b>mosquito</b> population dynamics. For each years and <b>mosquito</b> trap, starting from weekly data, annual indexes that summarize <b>mosquito</b> seasonal population dynamics were derived; precisely, the yearly total <b>mosquito</b> abundance, defined as {{the sum of all}} weekly captures within the year and the date of significant onset for <b>mosquito</b> activity (defined as the date when cumulative <b>mosquito</b> abundance exceeds 10 % of total abundance). It has been found that both the onset of <b>mosquito</b> activity and total <b>mosquito</b> abundance are well explained by early predictors that consider only climatic and environmental conditions during the spring season. Precisely, the onset of <b>mosquito</b> activity is well predicted by growing degree temperature cumulated in the first 19 weeks of the year (around half of May) while total <b>mosquito</b> abundance is well predicted by spring warming (speed of temperature increase in spring) and by total precipitation during spring...|$|R

5|$|Indoor {{residual}} spraying is the spraying of insecticides on {{the walls}} inside a home. After feeding, many <b>mosquitoes</b> rest on a nearby surface while digesting the bloodmeal, so if the walls of houses have been coated with insecticides, the resting <b>mosquitoes</b> can be killed before they can bite another person and transfer the malaria parasite. As of 2006, the World Health Organization recommends 12 insecticides in IRS operations, including DDT and the pyrethroids cyfluthrin and deltamethrin. This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under the Stockholm Convention, which prohibits its agricultural use. One problem with all forms of IRS is insecticide resistance. <b>Mosquitoes</b> affected by IRS tend to rest and live indoors, and due to the irritation caused by spraying, their descendants tend to rest and live outdoors, meaning that they are less affected by the IRS.|$|E

5|$|The first {{evidence}} of malaria parasites {{was found in}} <b>mosquitoes</b> preserved in amber from the Palaeogene period that are approximately 30 million years old. Human malaria likely originated in Africa and coevolved with its hosts, <b>mosquitoes</b> and non-human primates.

P. vivax, another malarial Plasmodium species among the six that infect humans, also likely originated in African gorillas and chimpanzees. Another malarial species recently discovered to be transmissible to humans, P. knowlesi, originated in Asian macaque monkeys.

5|$|After {{the threat}} from {{invasion}} muted in 1941, the Command's attention turned to the Battle of the Atlantic. During this time, the Command used the Martin Maryland, which excelled in PR work. On 13 July 1941, the first PR Mosquito arrived, though it was some time before the aircraft was operational. By September 1941, the operational strength of the PRU's first flight was 37 Spitfires, two Marylands and two <b>Mosquitoes.</b> The long-range Spitfires and <b>Mosquitoes</b> could reach deep into German airspace, and photograph the Baltic Sea ports and monitor German surface ships. Flights of eight hours were not uncommon. One Spitfire reached Gdynia, searching for the German battleship Tirpitz. Tactics needed to vary to avoid Spitfires being intercepted by German patrols at heights of 30,000ft. Constant trips alerted the Germans to the British operations, but the Admiralty insisted in the volume of flights so they could keep tabs on German capital ships. With surprise lost, the only solution was to change the height and directions of approach.|$|E
