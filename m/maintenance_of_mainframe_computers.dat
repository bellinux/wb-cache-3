40|$|A {{performance}} {{evaluation of a}} variety of computers frequently found in a scientific or engineering research environment was conducted using a synthetic and application program benchmarks. From a performance perspective, emerging commodity processors have superior performance relative to legacy <b>mainframe</b> <b>computers.</b> In many cases, the PC clusters exhibited comparable performance with traditional mainframe hardware when 8 - 12 processors were used. The main advantage of the PC clusters was related to their cost. Regardless of whether the clusters were built from new computers or whether they were created from retired computers their performance to cost ratio was superior to the legacy <b>mainframe</b> <b>computers.</b> Finally, the typical annual <b>maintenance</b> cost <b>of</b> legacy <b>mainframe</b> <b>computers</b> is several times the cost of new equipment such as multiprocessor PC workstations. The savings from eliminating the annual maintenance fee on legacy hardware can result in a yearly increase in total computational capability for an organization...|$|R

50|$|To make {{best use}} <b>of</b> <b>mainframe</b> <b>computer</b> {{processor}} time, input/output tasks were delegated to separate systems called Channel I/O. The mainframe would not require any I/O processing at all, instead would just set parameters for an input or output operation and then signal the channel processor {{to carry out}} the whole of the operation. By dedicating relatively simple sub-processors to handle time-consuming I/O formatting and processing, overall system performance was improved.|$|R
25|$|In {{many ways}} the fair symbolized a grand {{consumer}} show covering many products produced in America at the time for transportation, living, and consumer electronic needs {{in a way that}} would never be repeated at future world's fairs in North America. Many major American manufacturing companies from pen manufacturers, to chemical companies, to computers, to automobiles had a major presence. This fair gave many attendees their first interaction with computer equipment. Corporations demonstrated the use <b>of</b> <b>mainframe</b> <b>computers,</b> computer terminals with keyboards and CRT displays, teletype machines, punch cards, and telephone modems in an era when computer equipment was kept in back offices away from the public, decades before the Internet and home computers were at everyone's disposal.|$|R
