40|$|VSA (Vacuum Swing Adsorption) is a {{promising}} technology for capturing CO 2 {{which is known}} to contribute to global warming. Capture of CO 2 from flue gas streams using adsorption processes must deal {{with the prospect of}} high humidity streams containing bulk CO 2 as well as other impurities such as SOx, NOx, etc. However, most studies to date have ignored this aspect of CO 2 capture. The major problem caused by water vapour is that water is a much stronger adsorbate than CO 2 on most of the polar adsorbents thus drastically reducing the CO 2 adsorption capacity. Although the water problem may be tackled by adding a pretreatment drier before the CO 2 VSA unit, this will result in a large increase of capital and operational cost. Therefore, there is a strong economic motivation to integrate the drying and CO 2 recovery in a single VSA process for commercialization of CO 2 VSA technology. The main purpose of this project is to study the influence of water vapour on the adsorption of CO 2 both in the light of fundamentals of adsorption and in the application of post-combustion carbon capture by vacuum swing adsorption experimentally and theoretically. Adsorption equilibria of a CO 2 /H 2 O binary mixture were measured on activated alumina F- 200 at several temperatures and over a wide range of concentrations from 4 % to around 90 % relative humidity. In comparison with the single component data, the loading of CO 2 was not reduced in the presence of H 2 O whereas at low relative humidity the adsorption of H 2 O was depressed. The binary system was described by a competitive/cooperative adsorption model where the readily adsorbed water layers acted as secondary sites for further CO 2 adsorption via hydrogen bonding or hydration reactions. The combination of kinetic models namely a Langmuir isotherm for characterizing pure CO 2 adsorption and a BET isotherm for H 2 O was extended to derive a binary adsorption equilibrium model for the CO 2 /H 2 O mixture. Models based on the ideal adsorbed solution theory of Myers and Prausnitz failed to characterize the data over the whole composition range and a large deviation of binary CO 2 /H 2 O equilibrium from ideal solution behavior was observed. The extended Langmuir-BET (LBET) isotherm, analogous to the extended Langmuir equation, drastically underestimated the CO 2 loading. By incorporating the interactions between CO 2 and H 2 O molecules on the adsorbent surface and taking into account the effect of nonideality, the realistic interactive LBET (R-LBET) model was found to be in very good agreement with the experimental data. In contrast, CO 2 adsorption on zeolite 13 X was entirely depressed at higher water humidity. Direct modification of 13 X by silanes increased the hydrophobicity of the adsorbent but also reduced CO 2 uptake. A laboratory-scale VSA apparatus was constructed and used to experimentally examine the capture of CO 2 from a 10 – 12 % synthetic flue gas stream over a range of water relative humidity. Breakthrough experiments with a binary CO 2 /H 2 O mixture in a near-adiabatic double layered 3 A/ 13 X column showed a peculiar dual roll-up phenomenon. Water adsorption generated a pure thermal wave which traveled ahead of the water concentration front and swept off the readily adsorbed CO 2 leading to a thermal induced roll-up; the slow propagation of the water concentration wave displaced the CO 2 by competitive adsorption resulting in n equilibrium induced roll-up. Cyclic VSA experiments with single layered 13 X column and multilayered Al 2 O 3 / 13 X column configurations were conducted. The migration of the water and its subsequent impact on capture performance was evaluated. The formation of a water zone creates a “cold spot” which has implications for the system performance. Although the concentration of water leaving the bed under vacuum was high, the low vacuum pressure prevented condensation of this stream. The vacuum pump acted as a condenser and separator to remove bulk water. An important consequence of the presence of a water zone was to elevate the vacuum level thereby reducing CO 2 working capacity. On the other hand, the internal purge of CO 2 was found to be of critical importance to lower the water partial pressure during evacuation. The penetration of water in the column could be managed by keeping an appropriate volumetric purge-to-feed ratio or a higher vacuum level. This effect was predicted by our axial adiabatic working capacity model. At relatively high water content (> 4 % v/v) in the feed, the use of a water prelayer was essential to prevent failure of the system. The overall performance of the VSA with wet feed decreased slightly compared with the performance for dry feed. Reasonable results have been achieved for a triple layered single column VSA in the case with the highest feed humidity of 8. 5 % v/v, with a product CO 2 recovery of 58. 2 %, purity 52. 4 % and productivity 0. 128 kg CO 2 /h/L adsorbent. Further scale-up of this process by using <b>multi-columns</b> and a more sophisticated cycle design is expected to further improve the performance. Thus although there is a detrimental effect of water on CO 2 capture, long term recovery of CO 2 is still possible in a single VSA process...|$|R
