40|$|From {{the many}} {{attempts}} {{to produce a}} conceptual framework for the organization of living systems, the notions of (<b>M,R)</b> <b>systems</b> and Autopoiesis stand out for their rigor, their presupposition of the circularity of metabolism, and the new epistemologies that they imply. From their inceptions, these two notions have been essentially disconnected because each has defined its own language and tools. Here we demonstrate {{the existence of a}} deep conceptual link between (<b>M,R)</b> <b>systems</b> and Autopoietic systems. This relationship permits us to posit that Autopoietic systems, which have been advanced as capturing the central aspects of living systems, are a subset of (<b>M,R)</b> <b>systems.</b> This result, in conjunction with previous theorems proved by Rosen, can be used to outline a demonstration that the operation of Autopoietic systems cannot be simulated by Turing machines. This powerful result shows the potential of linking these two models. Finally, we suggest that the formalism of (<b>M,R)</b> <b>systems</b> could be used to model the circularity of metabolism...|$|R

Question 2 asked if the <b>MR</b> <b>system</b> overall better facilitates design collaboration tasks than the NavisWorks Roamer, with which about 69 % of respondents agreed. Most of the respondents (63 %) believed that the <b>MR</b> <b>system</b> better facilitated communication and creativity {{and a total of}} 65 % of the respondents totally or partially agreed with the statement that the <b>MR</b> <b>system</b> better facilitated problem-solving. The increase in the overall quality of output from the collaboration is marginally positive (57 %), however, the belief that the <b>MR</b> <b>system</b> better facilitated the quantity of work in a given amount of time and increased the quality of the user’s contribution to the project is more marked (70 % and 70 % respectively). It is surprising that these impressions are not stronger in light of the clear time benefits that were observed. The belief that there has been an increase in self-satisfaction from the collaboration as a result of using the <b>MR</b> <b>system</b> is well supported by 63 % of the users.

30|$|Questions 5, 10, 11, and 12 {{deal with}} the issues {{regarding}} the overall control of the <b>MR</b> <b>system.</b> The surrounding real background seemed to marginally help the subjects’ spatial comprehension of the model (Mean, 3.56; S.D., 1.15) as evidenced by responses to Question 5, an expected result. The real background could {{have served as a}} stationary landmark reference for orientation of the virtual model, especially while users were turning the tracking marker. Question 12 responses indicate almost all the subjects had a fairly uncomfortable experience with long-term use of the <b>MR</b> <b>system,</b> with a very low mean rating of 2.06 (S.D., 1.28). This result is in accordance with the high physical discomfort rating in the first questionnaire discussed earlier. The bulky HMD is the most significant usability issue of the <b>MR</b> <b>system.</b> Because the design review collaboration task might require long-duration, intensive work, the <b>MR</b> <b>system</b> would require moderately high levels of ease of use and user comfort. It was found that using the <b>MR</b> <b>system</b> produced neck strain in some users. The tracking and interaction techniques in future generations of the <b>MR</b> <b>system</b> must be easy, comfortable, and intuitive to the user, so that the focus can be on the task and not on the system itself.|$|E

30|$|Based on the {{experimental}} {{evaluation of the}} MR-based virtual space system, several conclusions were noted. It was observed that the subjects using the <b>MR</b> <b>system</b> completed the task much faster than the subjects using the NavisWorks Roamer commercial visualization software. It appears the increased 3 D visual perception, spatial cognition, and spatial layout of the design offloaded the required mental processing to the <b>MR</b> <b>system</b> and thus enabled the subjects {{to complete the task}} in a shorter time. Subjects felt more physical comfort using NavisWorks Roamer than the <b>MR</b> <b>system.</b> The subjects rated the level of immersion for the <b>MR</b> <b>system,</b> on average, much higher than for the NavisWorks Roamer application, which implies that MR definitely provides the users a sense of being present or isolated with the model, more than with the static model in NavisWorks Roamer. The subjects believed that the <b>MR</b> <b>system</b> was more suitable for making decisions and performing tasks on design models than the NavisWorks Roamer. MR seemed to better facilitate communication, creativity and problem-solving. The increase in the overall quality of output from the collaboration is marginally positive, however, the belief that the <b>MR</b> <b>system</b> better facilitated the quantity of work in a given amount of time and increased the quality of the user’s contribution to the project is more marked. Perhaps more importantly, there is a belief that there has been an increase in self-satisfaction from the collaboration as a result of using MR.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The use of 3. 0 -T <b>MR</b> <b>systems</b> is {{increasing}} worldwide. We evaluated magnetic field interactions and translational attraction for 32 aneurysm clips {{in association with}} exposure to “long-bore ” and “short-bore ” 3. 0 -T <b>MR</b> imaging <b>systems.</b> METHODS: Thirty-two different aneurysm clips were evaluated in this investigation. Each aneurysm clip was qualitatively evaluated for magnetic field interactions and quantitatively assessed for translational attraction by using the deflection angle test. The deflection angle tests were performed at the points of the highest spatial gradients for long-bore and short-bore 3. 0 -T <b>MR</b> imaging <b>systems.</b> RESULTS: Seventeen of the 32 aneurysm clips showed positive magnetic field interactions. Deflection angles for the aneurysm clips were significantly (P <. 001) higher on the short-bore (range, 0 – 18 degrees) compared with those recorded on the long-bore (range, 0 – 16 degrees) 3. 0 -T <b>MR</b> imaging <b>system.</b> Aneurysm clips made from commercially pure titanium and titanium alloy displayed no translational attraction (n 15), whereas those made from stainless steel alloy, Phynox, and Elgiloy displayed positive deflection angles (n 17).

40|$|Background: The {{design review}} process is often {{expensive}} {{due to the}} need for face-to-face meetings between the involved parties. Distributed design collaboration is made possible by advances in networking techniques. A tangible Mixed Reality (MR) -based virtual design prototype was created as a distributed virtual environment (DVE) for the purpose of improving remote design review collaboration. This tangible <b>MR</b> <b>system</b> has been developed to a point that experimental evaluation is necessary {{in order to understand the}} strengths and weaknesses of various features of the system. Methods: In this paper, we evaluated the tangible <b>MR</b> <b>system</b> against a commercial 3 D distributed design review system in three aspects: the investigation of how users experienced virtual models in the tangible <b>MR</b> <b>system</b> as compared with the commercial system, the measurement of the users’ attitude towards the effectiveness of the tangible <b>MR</b> <b>system,</b> and the discoveries of usability issues involved in the tangible MR interface through usability studies. Results: The findings from user feedback suggest that the tangible <b>MR</b> <b>system</b> may facilitate problem-solving and the quantity of work in a given amount of time and that virtual design displayed in the mixed scene was a useful aid in the design error detection task. Conclusion: These findings are useful for the improvement of future generations of the <b>MR</b> <b>system.</b> Also the suggestions can be further generalized to become usability guidelines for the MR developers in other applications and domains...|$|E
30|$|As {{stated above}} in Section 1, the entire {{experimentation}} was implemented using the procedure/method {{that was set}} by the authors in a study comparing face-to-face collaboration facilitated by paper and MR media (Wang and Dunston, 2008).

The remaining discussion details {{the evaluation of the}} MRDVEs using the same method. The experiment aimed to collect data for investigating the subjects’ experience with the <b>MR</b> <b>system,</b> gauge the subjects’ attitude towards the <b>MR</b> <b>system,</b> and discover usability issues. Three questionnaires were administered to individual participants in an experiment where pairs of subjects worked collaboratively using both the MR-based virtual space system and a leading commercial design review application to detect design errors: the first questionnaire was devised to measure the users’ attitude towards the effectiveness of the MR system; the second questionnaire investigated how users experienced virtual models in the <b>MR</b> <b>system</b> as compared with the commercial system; the third questionnaire aimed to reveal usability issues involved in the <b>MR</b> <b>system</b> interface through a usability study.|$|E

30|$|Interaction {{with the}} virtual model via the nine {{functions}} in the NavisWorks Roamer seemed to be as natural and intuitive as in the <b>MR</b> <b>system</b> according to the ratings (NavisWorks: Mean, 3.26; S.D., 1.03; MR: Mean, 3.87; S.D., 0.64). The difference is insignificant according to the p-value[*]>[*] 0.05, and therefore Hypothesis 3 is not supported. This similarity can be explained as the trade-off between the unnaturalness of MR due to the demand of more physical effort and the intuitiveness of interaction with the virtual model via the virtual tracking ball. The subjects assessed the level of immersion for the <b>MR</b> <b>system</b> at an average rating of 4.37 (S.D., 0.81) compared with 2.73 (S.D., 0.88) for the NavisWorks Roamer with a significant p-value indication, which strongly implies that the <b>MR</b> <b>system</b> provides the users {{a greater sense of}} being present with the model.
