500|$|Gregory G. Garre, Assistant Solicitor General {{argued the}} case for the United States. As the petitioner, Garre argued that the 1960 act did not authorize {{monetary}} damages for a breach of trust duties. Their position was that while a trust was formed, the tribe could not make a claim for damages without explicit congressional authorization. Further, he argued, the exclusive control does not create liability; only the explicit language of statutes and regulations could allow monetary damages. The position of the United States was that [...] "in trust" [...] <b>meant</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the land was not subject to alienation or to state taxation.|$|E
500|$|While {{promoting}} the novel, Neil Gaiman {{said that it}} was [...] "unquestionably the finest English novel of the fantastic written in the last 70 years", a statement which has most often been read hyperbolically. However, as Clute explains, what Gaiman <b>meant</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Jonathan Strange is [...] "the finest English novel of the fantastic since Hope Mirrlees's great Lud-in-the-Mist (1926), which is almost certainly the finest English fantasy about the relationship between England and the fantastic yet published" [...] (emphasis in original). Clute writes that [...] "a more cautious claim" [...] would be: [...] "if Susanna Clarke finishes the story she has hardly begun in Strange...she may well have then written the finest English novel of the fantastic about the myth of England and the myth of the fantastic and the marriage of the two ever published, bar none of the above, including Mirrlees." ...|$|E
50|$|In the Indian astronomical tradition, a Yuga is {{a period}} {{consisting}} of 1,577,917,500 civil days. Saturn makes 146,564 revolutions and Mars makes 229,6824 revolutions in a Yuga. So Saturn makes 146,564/1,577,917,500 = 36,641/394,479,375 revolutions in a day. By saying that the residue of the revolution of Saturn is x, what <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the fractional number of revolutions is x/394,479,375. Similarly, Mars makes 229,6824/1,577,917,500 = 190,412/131,493,125 revolutions in a day.

500|$|On 13 November, Malaysia's Agent, Ambassador-at-Large Abdul Kadir Mohamad, {{alleged that}} [...] Singapore {{was trying to}} [...] "subvert" [...] a 150-year-old {{arrangement}} under which Singapore operated Horsburgh Lighthouse on Pedra Branca, which was Malaysia's territory. He also suggested that if permitted to do so, Singapore would upset the peace and stability of {{the area where the}} island is located. He said that if Singapore reclaimed land around Pedra Branca, [...] "uite apart from the possible effects on the environment and navigation in the Strait, this could lead to potentially serious changes to the security arrangements in the eastern entrance of the Strait". According to Malaysian Attorney-General Abdul Gani Patail, Singapore had first raised the issue of sovereignty over Pedra Branca on 13 April 1978 during a meeting between officials, saying it had [...] "incontrovertible legal evidence" [...] of its sovereignty over the island though it had never produced any documents in support. Prior to that, the sovereignty of the island had never been disputed. The 1980 statement by the then Malaysian Prime Minister Tun Hussein Onn concerning the [...] "unclear" [...] position of the island had also been premised on these documents which former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew had claimed were in Singapore's possession. The statement was therefore merely a friendly and respectful statement of a visiting prime minister at a press conference which had no probative value in court. All Hussein Onn had <b>meant</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the matter required further discussion between the two countries.|$|E
500|$|Debbage comments, [...] "One {{strength}} of Bradley Joseph {{as an artist}} has been his keen ability to write inspiring music with appropriately titled songs that express that thought non-verbally". [...] Joseph explained to Janus that, [...] "Through instrumental music, I'm allowed {{to come up with}} musical ideas that allow the listener to create their own impression of my song. If you add lyrics about a girl in the song, the listener doesn't have a choice of what the song is about, it's told to them. My musical writings allow me to express anything. [...] It's easier for me to tell a story of something I've encountered this way than to verbalize it. [...] And my feelings are explored more in my compositions compared to what I could ever say in a few sentences." [...] He believes that [...] "music allows a person to express their deepest thoughts, thoughts that cannot be expressed with just words." [...] He also believes that the spiritual aspect of creating is to [...] "find something deep within yourself that can only be created by you"..."Your spiritual self cannot be copied and that's why it's so significant in life and music", he says. [...] Parsons goes on to say, [...] "The influence of years of touring with Yanni is apparent in the richness of Joseph's sound, but his musical voice is his own." [...] Yanni once said, [...] "Bradley, your extreme sensitivity is your greatest gift". Joseph later realized what Yanni <b>meant</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he needed that as a composer, that it was a crucial component [...] "to be sensitive to what you see {{and to be able to}} apply that to music".|$|E

In his thinking about the biological processes linking DNA genes to proteins, Crick made explicit the distinction between the materials involved, the energy required, and the information flow. Crick was focused on this third component (information) and it became the organizing principle of what became known as molecular biology. Crick had by this time become a highly influential theoretical molecular biologist.|$|E

[...] Commentators have indicated that what she <b>meant</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the reference of objects remained central to her work, although the representation of them had not. Scholar Marjorie Perloff had said of Stein that [...] "nlike her contemporaries (Eliot, Pound, Moore), she does not give us an image, however fractured, of a carafe on a table; rather, she forces us to reconsider how language actually constructs the world we know." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Mitchell Bard, the two Jewish groups aim {{to present}} policy makers with unified and {{representative}} messages via the aggregation and filtering {{of the diversity}} of opinions held by smaller pro-Israel lobby groups and the wider American Jewish community. The diverse spectrum of opinions held by American Jewry is reflected in the many formal pro-Israel groups, and as such some analysts make a distinction within the Israel lobby between right-leaning and left-leaning groups. [...] This diversity became more pronounced following Israel’s acceptance of the Oslo Accords, which split “liberal universalists” and “hard-core Zionists --- the Orthodox community and right wing Jews”. This division mirrored a similar split for and against the Oslo process in Israel, and led to a parallel rift within the pro-Israel lobby. [...] During the 2008 election campaign, Barack Obama implicitly noted differences within the lobby in his comment that [...] "there is a strain within the pro-Israel community that says, 'unless you adopt an unwavering pro-Likud approach to Israel, that you’re anti-Israel,' and that can’t be the measure of our friendship with Israel." [...] Commentary Magazine, notes “It was an odd choice of words—Likud has not been Israel’s governing party for more than three years—but what Obama clearly <b>meant</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> an American politician should not have to express fealty to the most hard-line ideas relating to Israel’s security to be considered a supporter of Israel’s.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the second}} half of 1916, the Germanophile option was ruled out by Premier Ion I. C. Brătianu. With Ferdinand's acquiescence, Brătianu signed the secret treaty of Bucharest, which {{attached}} Romania to the Entente and promised her the annexation of Transylvania and Bukovina (see Romania in World War I). The news was communicated to the country's statesmen at a new Crown Council, on August 27, 1916. There followed a heated exchange between Carp and the King, as witnessed by the other participants—including arch-rival Take Ionescu, who noted [...] " [...] is Shakespearean in his error." [...] Prophesying defeat, Carp brought into discussion Ferdinand's German (Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen) lineage. To his [...] "No Hohenzollern was ever defeated", Ferdinand tacitly acknowledged the issue: [...] "I have already defeated one" [...] (that is, himself). Carp then shocked the audience by stating: [...] "I shall pray to God that the Romanian army be defeated", or, [...] "I wish you'd be vanquished, for your victory would mean the country's destruction and demise." [...] Sources also diverge on what Carp said next. One story is that he promised to sacrifice his sons for a cause he did not believe in, by allowing them to be drafted into the Romanian military. According to others, what he actually <b>meant</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the three young men would be serving the Central Powers.|$|E
