5000|$|... or a <b>mechanical</b> <b>lock</b> that {{releases}} upon power failure, {{allowing you}} to push or slide the gate open.|$|E
50|$|A {{standard}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>lock,</b> {{operated by}} a lever in the lever frame. It could not be released unless the Home signal was at Danger.|$|E
50|$|It is conceptually {{similar to}} the balisong ("butterfly knife") in {{that it has no}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>lock</b> or spring pressure, but is kept in the open {{position}} during use by the leverage imparted by the user's hand.|$|E
5000|$|Electronic locks {{as well as}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>locks</b> are {{available}} on many models of safes. The highest reliability exists for <b>mechanical</b> <b>locks,</b> although they are often more time consuming to open than electronic <b>locks.</b> [...] Some <b>mechanical</b> combination <b>locks</b> have key locks, too, that lock the combination lock dial from turning, thereby precluding casual attempts by anyone with physical access to the safe from trying multiple combinations {{in the hopes of}} unlocking the safe.|$|R
5000|$|ZF-I lenses feature <b>mechanical</b> <b>locks</b> for {{focus and}} aperture, and {{additional}} environmental sealing, for industrial applications.|$|R
50|$|Keyless {{ignition}} {{does not}} by default provide better security. In October 2014, {{it was found}} that some insurers in the UK would not insure certain vehicles with keyless ignition unless there were additional <b>mechanical</b> <b>locks</b> in place due to weaknesses in the keyless system.|$|R
50|$|Frank Best's oldest son, Walter Best, {{owned the}} {{majority}} {{shares of the}} three Best companies and served as President from 1966 through 1994 and it was during his tenure that the full line of <b>mechanical</b> <b>lock</b> hardware was developed.|$|E
50|$|On 8 January 2014, Allegion {{acquired}} certain {{assets of}} Schlage Lock de Colombia S.A., {{the second largest}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>lock</b> manufacturer in Colombia with revenues of US $12 million. The acquisition gave Allegion a 45,000-square-foot integrated plant in Bogota, Colombia and approximately 350 new employees.|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic-set packers use fluid {{pressure}} {{to drive the}} cone behind the slips. Once set they remain set {{by the use of}} either entrapped pressure or a <b>mechanical</b> <b>lock.</b> They are released by picking up the tubing. They are good for used in deviated or crooked holes where tubing movement is restricted or unwanted. The tubing can be hung in neutral tension.|$|E
5000|$|Moving parts do {{not include}} any moving fluids, such as fuel, coolant or {{hydraulic}} fluid. Moving parts also {{do not include}} any <b>mechanical</b> <b>locks,</b> switches, nuts and bolts, screw caps for bottles etc. A system with no moving parts is described as [...] "solid state".|$|R
50|$|Open front {{differential}} (<b>mechanical</b> differential <b>lock</b> optional on Vanagon).|$|R
50|$|Physical {{access control}} {{is a matter of}} who, where, and when. An access control system determines who is allowed to enter or exit, where they are allowed to exit or enter, and when they are allowed to enter or exit. Historically, this was {{partially}} accomplished through keys and locks. When a door is locked, only someone with a key can enter through the door, depending on how the <b>lock</b> is configured. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>locks</b> and keys do not allow restriction of the key holder to specific times or dates. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>locks</b> and keys do not provide records of the key used on any specific door, and the keys can be easily copied or transferred to an unauthorized person. When a mechanical key is lost or the key holder is no longer authorized to use the protected area, the locks must be re-keyed.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{design of the}} bearing had a long keyed sleeve and a Threaded Ring (TR) lock. This was the typical design through the 1950s when the Quick-Change (QC) <b>mechanical</b> <b>lock</b> was introduced. Short-key and keyless KL® bearings were introduced in the late 1970s to reduce roll force variation and allow the mill operators to produce a higher quality product.|$|E
50|$|ControlTrac II {{has since}} been {{replaced}} by the automatic Intelligent four-wheel drive system, a similar system with the viscous coupling replaced by a computer controlled clutch. The Intelligent 4WD system functionally acts similar to the ControlTrac II system, with the front wheels being driven predominately with torque being sent to the rear wheels only as conditions dictate. The Intelligent 4WD system also lacks the <b>mechanical</b> <b>lock</b> provided by ControlTrac II.|$|E
5000|$|Strike plate - A {{plate with}} a hole in the middle made to receive a bolt. If the strike is for a latchbolt, it {{typically}} also includes a small ramped area to help the bolt move inward while the door is being closed. (Also known as just [...] "strike") It's also available as electric strike which allows you to open the door even though the <b>mechanical</b> <b>lock</b> is locked.|$|E
40|$|Our {{proposed}} {{idea for}} this project is an application that would utilize RF readers along with RF tags in tracking and logging of hourly employee hours; along with this we would control a <b>mechanical</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism via wireless commands. This {{would be used to}} substitute manual clock punching in and out. Employees could have small R...|$|R
40|$|Following {{testing methods}} have been {{compared}} and their response assessed to parameter changes {{in the process of}} plasma spraying and substrate pretreatment: Pull-off-test, hardness-indentation-test, shear test, and fracture mechanics by 4 -point-bend test and double- torsion-test. Different effects on the adhesion properties like <b>mechanical</b> <b>locking,</b> physical bonding forces, residual stress enter the test results in a different way. Thus the results prove, that the shear test is revealing the effect of <b>mechanical</b> <b>locking</b> of coating material with the roughened substrate surface better, while the interfacial hardness indentation test is more sensitive to the physical bonding forces between coating and substrate. Between those two methods the pull-off test takes an intermediate position. Both the 4 -point-bend test and the double torsion test arrangement don't give an unimbigous decision, whether the cohesive or the adhesive strength has been measured, because the fraction course run near the interface in the coating materia...|$|R
50|$|ZF is the {{original}} product line. ZF.2 lenses are CPU-enabled (similar to Nikon AI-P lenses) offering full metering compatibility with {{the full range of}} AF Nikon SLR cameras. ZF-I lenses add <b>mechanical</b> <b>locks</b> for focus and aperture, and additional environmental sealing, for industrial applications. ZF-IR lenses are adapted to infrared imaging, with coatings that transmit wavelengths up to 1100 nm, and focus scales marked for infrared.|$|R
50|$|ControlTrac II was a Ford {{four-wheel drive}} {{system based on}} a viscous {{coupling}} unit. The viscous coupling replaced the typical center differential used in four-wheel drive applications. The system worked normally in front wheel drive {{but in addition to}} the front wheels being driven, a shaft is powered that runs to the viscous coupling in the rear. If the front wheels slip, the viscous coupling progressively releases torque to the rear wheels. Additionally, the ControlTrac II system provided a <b>mechanical</b> <b>lock</b> of four-wheel drive though there was no low range provided by the system.|$|E
5000|$|Fail-secure. Also called fail-locked or non-fail safe. In this configuration, {{applying}} {{electric current}} to the strike will {{cause it to}} unlock. In this configuration, the strike would remain locked in a power failure, but typically the <b>mechanical</b> <b>lock</b> can still be used {{to open the door}} from the inside for egress from the secure side. These units can be powered by alternating current, which will cause the unit to buzz, or DC power, which offers silent operation, except for a [...] "click" [...] while the unit is powered.|$|E
50|$|In 1978 a {{combination}} lock {{which could be}} set by the user to a sequence of his own choosing was invented by Andrew Elliot Rae. At this time the electronic keypad was invented and {{he was unable to}} get any manufacturers to back his <b>mechanical</b> <b>lock</b> for lockers, luggage, or brief-cases. The silicon chip locks never became popular due to the need for battery power to maintain their integrity. The patent expired and the original mechanical invention was instantly manufactured and sold worldwide mainly for luggage, lockers, and hotel safes. It is now a standard part of the luggage used by travellers.|$|E
50|$|Railway {{interlocking}} is of British origin, where numerous patents were granted. In June 1856, John Saxby {{received the}} first patent for interlocking switches and signals. In 1868, Saxby (of Saxby & Farmer) {{was awarded a}} patent for what is known today in North America as “preliminary latch locking”. Preliminary latch locking became so successful that by 1873, 13,000 <b>mechanical</b> <b>locking</b> levers were employed on the London and North Western Railway alone.|$|R
50|$|The third {{component}} in SIPs is the spline or connector piece between SIP panels. Dimensional lumber {{is commonly used}} but creates thermal bridging and lowers insulation values. To maintain higher insulation values through the spline, manufacturers use Insulated Lumber, Composite Splines, <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Locks,</b> Overlapping OSB Panels, or other creative methods. Depending on the method selected, other advantages such as full nailing surfaces or increased structural strength may become available.|$|R
50|$|Finally, most {{electric}} locking hardware still have mechanical keys as a fail-over. <b>Mechanical</b> key <b>locks</b> {{are vulnerable to}} bumping.|$|R
50|$|The lock can {{be either}} {{mechanical}} or electronic. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>lock</b> {{is based on the}} distribution of an RFID-tagged key from a pillar box dispenser. The electronic lock relies on an RFID reader on the bicycle, together with a keyboard for casual users. A long term member will simply flash the member card on the bike to unlock it while the casual user will purchase a code, by internet, SMS, at a counter, or from a credit-card pillar dispenser. One idea is to share costs of payment methods and of street furniture with other existing systems such as car park ticket machines or public transport ticket systems, which can host the radio relay server.|$|E
50|$|An {{electric}} {{strike is}} an access control device used for doors. It replaces the fixed strike faceplate often {{used with a}} latchbar (also known as a keeper). Like a fixed strike, it normally presents a ramped surface to the locking latch allowing the door to close and latch just like a fixed strike would. However, an electric strike's ramped surface can, upon command, pivot {{out of the way}} when the lock on the door is in the locked position and the door is opened, allowing a user to open the door without operating the <b>mechanical</b> <b>lock</b> or using a mechanical key. After the door is opened past the keeper, the keeper returns to its standard position and re-locks when power is removed or applied, depending upon the strike's configuration.|$|E
5000|$|For {{some time}} Union Connector {{produced}} 2P&G connectors with a distinctive yellow cover that featured a locking tab {{in the ground}} pin that provided a positive <b>mechanical</b> <b>lock</b> to prevent accidental disengagement of the connectors. This design required special connectors on both {{the male and female}} side in order to work, meaning that all connectors in an installation would need to be replaced to see a real benefit to the locking feature. The expense of this proposition as well as the unpopularity of the connector itself among technicians led the locking feature to eventually be dropped, and locking connectors are no longer manufactured. The locking connectors that are still found occasionally in installations or spare parts bins are often referred to as [...] "Union Connectors", though the Union Connector brand now features only standard non-locking stage pin connectors.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{electronic}} time locks {{have some}} functions {{not available to}} <b>mechanical</b> time <b>locks,</b> like resettable timers and pre-set times to activate.|$|R
40|$|A {{new process}} of joining tubes from {{different}} materials to a bimetallic tube {{based on a}} combination of large shear and high hydrostatic pressure is proposed. It results in improved <b>mechanical</b> <b>locking</b> of surface asperities, along with enhanced diffusivity owing to the ultrafine-grained microstructure produced. This is augmented by a temperature increase due to heat release associated with mechanical work. Electron microscopy characterization of the interface and the adjacent regions supports the hypothesis of enhanced interdiffusion...|$|R
50|$|Early {{firearms}} were muzzle-loading, with powder, {{and then}} shot loaded from the muzzle, capable {{of only a}} low rate of fire. Breech loading provided {{a higher rate of}} fire, but early breech-loading guns lacked an effective way of sealing the escaping gases that leaked from the back end of the barrel, reducing the available muzzle velocity. During the 19th century effective <b>mechanical</b> <b>locks</b> were invented that sealed a breech-loading weapon against the escape of propellant gases.|$|R
50|$|The n/2 model (pronounced either ‘en over two’ or 'half en') {{suggests}} {{the mode of}} operation of the gene-for-gene relationship in a wild plant pathosystem. It apparently functions as a system of locking in which every host and parasite individual has half of the genes in the gene-for-gene relationship (i.e., n/2 genes, where n is {{the total number of}} pairs of genes in that relationship). Each gene in the host is the equivalent of a tumbler in a <b>mechanical</b> <b>lock,</b> and each gene in the parasite is the equivalent of a notch on a mechanical key. Provided that each n/2 combination of genes occurs with an equal frequency, and with a random distribution, in both the host and parasite populations, the frequency of matching allo-infections will be reduced to the minimum. For example, with six pairs of genes, each host and parasite individual would have three genes, and there would be twenty different locks and keys; with a twelve-gene system, there would be 924 six-gene locks and keys. Given an equal frequency and a random distribution of every lock and key, the frequency of matching allo-infection would be 1/20 and 1/924, respectively. These figures are obtained from the binomial expansion illustrated by Pascal's triangle.|$|E
5000|$|Lock {{manipulation}} is {{the famous}} safe cracking technique we've all seen in movies. It's a damage free combination recovery method, and a well known surreptitious bypass technique. Manipulation only requires fingers, eyes, and proper technique but it's a skill that takes years to develop and decades to master. Manipulation is a Group 2 <b>mechanical</b> <b>lock</b> bypass method. Expert practitioners of this art can open locks with speed and consistency. These professionals manually manipulate [...] the lock {{in order to obtain}} the combination one number at a time. Manipulation procedures can vary, but they all exploit the same imperfections. Manipulation will unlock a safe and recover its combination. Once the combination is recovered it may be reused to open the safe lock. Similar damage free bypass can also be completed by a computerized auto-dialer. These auto-dialer machines are known to take 24 hours or more to reach the correct combination. In recent years faster devices have been engineered for lock bypass. These new devices use more advanced robotics and more advanced software. When used in cooperation with each other the two technologies closely mimic manual manipulation. This generation of niche robotics mimics manual manipulation because they can [...] "feel," [...] and measure mechanical movement within the lock. The newest dialers can manipulate.|$|E
50|$|Unless carried {{or under}} the control of the owner, state law {{requires}} all firearms to be stored in a locked container, or equipped with a tamper-resistant <b>mechanical</b> <b>lock</b> or other safety device (see trigger lock), properly engaged so as to render such weapon inoperable by any person other than the owner or other lawfully authorized user. If in a vehicle, firearm must be unloaded and contained within the locked trunk of such vehicle or in a locked case or other secure container, unless the licensee has a Class A license, in which case the firearm must be under the licensee's direct control. Any firearms that are found to be unsecured may be confiscated by law enforcement officers and license may be revoked. In the event a license is revoked for any reason, law enforcement will confiscate all weapons and store them for 1 year before destroying them unless the revoked licensee transfers ownership to a properly licensed party who then claims the firearms. Also, gun license holders may encounter licensing issues when moving from one town to another. While one city or town police chief may have issued a license, the chief of police in the city or town where the license holder may move does not have to authorize it, and may require that guns be surrendered. If a gun license is not authorized, and the police determine that the resident also holds a license in a different state, they may contact law enforcement in that state and inform them of the action, which could lead to the loss of the out-of-state license as well.|$|E
50|$|A smart gun, or {{personalized}} gun, is {{a firearm}} {{that includes a}} safety feature or features that allow it to fire only when activated by an authorized user. These safety features can prevent misuse, accidental shootings, gun thefts, {{and use of the}} weapon against the owner. Smart guns distinguish between authorized users and unauthorized users in several different ways, including the use of RFID chips or other proximity tokens, fingerprint recognition, magnetic rings, or <b>mechanical</b> <b>locks.</b> Related to smart guns are other smart firearms safety devices such as biometric or RFID activated accessories and safes.|$|R
50|$|Electric mortise and {{cylindrical}} locks are drop-in {{replacements for}} door-mounted <b>mechanical</b> <b>locks.</b> An additional hole must be drilled {{in the door}} for electric power wires. Also, a power transfer hinge {{is often used to}} get the power from the door frame to the door. Electric mortise and cylindrical <b>locks</b> allow <b>mechanical</b> free egress, and can be either fail unlocked or fail locked. In the US, UL rated doors must retain their rating: in new construction doors are cored and then rated. but in retrofits, the doors must be re-rated.|$|R
50|$|Electronic {{access control}} uses {{computers}} {{to solve the}} limitations of <b>mechanical</b> <b>locks</b> and keys. A wide range of credentials {{can be used to}} replace mechanical keys. The electronic access control system grants access based on the credential presented. When access is granted, the door is unlocked for a predetermined time and the transaction is recorded. When access is refused, the door remains locked and the attempted access is recorded. The system will also monitor the door and alarm if the door is forced open or held open too long after being unlocked.|$|R
