25|$|The {{revolution}} of African slaves brought many fears to colonies surrounding Haiti and the Caribbean. Prominent wealthy American slave owners, {{reading about the}} revolution, also read speculation about what <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> their own states. However, newspapers like the Colombian Centinel took the extra steps to support the revolution, {{in the sense that}} it was based on the foundations of the American Revolution. The French media also played an important role in the Haitian Revolution, with contributions that made many French upstarts quite interested in the young, passionate Toussaint's writings of freedom.|$|E

On 12 September 1873 he was appointed to Wolseley’s staff for special services. He commanded a flank at the Battle of Amoaful (31 January 1874) where he was wounded. and at the Battle of Esaman. He helped recruit a regiment from among the coastal African tribes, although he wrote of the Fantis that “it {{would be difficult to}} imagine a more cowardly, useless lot of men”. He did, however, discourage British officers from using physical abuse on them.|$|E
25|$|Doom’s armor augments {{his natural}} {{physical}} strength to superhuman levels, {{to the point}} where he is able to overpower normal humans and hold his own against superhuman foes Spider-Man, the Hulk and the Thing in hand-to-hand combat, although he tends to rely on long-range tactics when engaging physically stronger foes. It is also nigh-indestructible, capable of taking hits from most superhuman foes to some cosmic level beings and protecting Doom from matter manipulation, reality warping and psychic assaults. The armor has an arsenal of high tech weaponry and gadgets hidden within it, energy manipulation, absorption and projection, is capable of generating a defensive force field and a lethal electric shock stunning or killing anyone who <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> contact with Doctor Doom. The armor is self-supporting, equipped with internal stores and recycling systems for air, food, water, and energy, allowing the wearer to survive lengthy periods of exposure underwater or in outer space.|$|E

5000|$|Note that [...] "demand" [...] {{is nowhere}} near as rude as it <b>might</b> <b>come</b> across <b>in</b> English. It is a polite but firm request, but not as polite as, say, [...] "would you...".|$|R
2500|$|This is {{especially}} important in the postseason. A few LCBL players are dual-sport athletes and must leave at playoff time {{for the start of}} college football practices. In order to qualify for these voided spots, undrafted [...] "rental" [...] players must dress for 15% of their team's total games. Drafted reserves can play in the postseason without this restriction. Since all conference managers had a chance to evaluate (and draft) them {{before the start of the}} season, their diminished talents are known. Managers keep these players on-call for a reason; their opportunity to play just <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> the team's most important games. [...] Both types of reserves must enter the roster while staying within the league's position-by-position limitations, filling a direct need at a particular place on the field.|$|E
2500|$|Highlining is slacklining at {{elevation}} {{above the}} ground or water. Many slackliners consider highlining to be the pinnacle of the sport. Highlines are commonly set up in locations {{that have been used}} or are still used for Tyrolean traverse. When rigging highlines, experienced slackers take measures to ensure that solid, redundant and equalized anchors are used to secure the line into position. Modern highline rigging typically entails a mainline of webbing, backup webbing, and either climbing rope or amsteel rope for redundancy. However, many highlines are rigged with a mainline and backup only, especially if the highline is low tension (less than [...] ), or rigged with high quality webbing like [...] or [...] It is also common to pad all areas of the rigging which <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> contact with abrasive surfaces. To ensure safety, most highliners wear a climbing harness or swami belt with a leash attached to the slackline itself. Leash-less, or [...] "free-solo" [...] slacklining– a term borrowed from rockclimbing– is not unheard of, however, with proponents such as Dean Potter and Andy Lewis.|$|E

6000|$|MRS HUSHABYE. One students' day. Paid sixpence {{to stumble}} about through {{a crowd of}} easels, when he <b>might</b> have <b>come</b> <b>in</b> next day for nothing and found the floor clear! Quite by accident? ...|$|R
6000|$|Burning {{tears of}} {{disappointment}} were upon Alison's cheek, the old hopeless blank was returning, {{and her brother}} <b>might</b> <b>come</b> back <b>in</b> vain, to find his enemy beyond his reach. Here was an end alike of his restoration and of Ermine's happiness! ...|$|R
60|$|AFTER a short interval, the drawing-room {{door was}} opened again. Waiting on the threshold, the Irish lord {{asked if he}} <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E
60|$|He had sat ruminating {{about the}} matter for some time, when the voice of Roker, the turnkey, demanded whether he <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E
60|$|MRS. MEGAN. [Impassive.] You said {{something}} abaht makin' {{a picture of}} me. [With faint eagerness.] So I thought I <b>might</b> <b>come,</b> <b>in</b> case you'd forgotten.|$|E

6000|$|... “Hem!” said Hiram, {{undergoing}} a violent struggle between {{his desire for}} vengeance, and his love of legal fame: “I do suppose—that in—that is—strict law—that supposing—maybe I hadn’t a real—lawful right; but as the case was—and Billy was so back’ard—I thought I <b>might</b> <b>come</b> for’ard <b>in</b> the business.” ...|$|R
60|$|But {{she rose}} and dressed in better spirits. It had been hardest to lie there and do nothing. Now the day was before her and {{something}} pleasant might happen. Spencer <b>might</b> <b>come</b> back <b>in</b> the evening. She would be doubly nice to him to make up.|$|R
60|$|Guy came in {{the next}} moment, and running lightly up-stairs after Mrs. Edmonstone, found her opening the dressing-room door, {{and asked if he}} <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E

60|$|Behind the {{soldiers}} the green carpet rolled itself up again, {{so that there}} was always just enough of it for the procession to walk upon, in order that their feet <b>might</b> not <b>come</b> <b>in</b> contact with the deadly, life-destroying sands of the desert.|$|R

60|$|It {{was a dark}} {{street with}} a dead wall on one side. Nearly all the outer doors of the houses stood open. I took the first entry, and knocked at a parlour-door. <b>Might</b> I <b>come</b> <b>in?</b> I <b>might,</b> if I plased, sur.|$|R

5000|$|Ray Davies said in late 1969, [...] "I'm {{not very}} witty at all. I feel {{intensely}} {{about a lot}} of things but it <b>might</b> <b>come</b> out <b>in</b> a funny sounding way.

6000|$|... "Really," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "you two are incomprehensible beings. Don't {{you know}} that people <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> here at any moment? It is {{fortunate}} that I was the person who came in at this moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|After {{the goods}} {{had been brought}} to light the earth was {{replaced}} in the excavation and pounded down carefully.
