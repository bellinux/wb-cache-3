5|$|After {{the band}} had walked offstage, {{in a move}} {{described}} by NME as the most <b>meaningful</b> of the concert, the audience faced the troops in the stadium and broke into a spontaneous round of applause, which quickly turned into an ovation—an act which the soldiers mimicked in turn.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{felt that}} this protest would dramatise Purna Swaraj {{in a way that}} was <b>meaningful</b> to the lowliest Indians. He also {{reasoned}} that it would build unity between Hindus and Muslims by fighting a wrong that touched them equally.|$|E
5|$|Grammar is {{the study}} of how <b>meaningful</b> {{elements}} called morphemes within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called words, and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called affixes. The way in which <b>meaningful</b> elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called morphology. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called syntax.|$|E
5|$|In {{the music}} video Mutual Core {{directed}} by Andrew Thomas Huang, Björk is organically {{part of nature}} and universe. The human connection to nature is a theme that underpins most of her artistic output. It’s particularly <b>meaningful</b> to bring Björk’s vision to 7 continents because of its relevance to all cultures.|$|E
5|$|Jim's {{health is}} excellent. That's {{not the reason}} he didn't {{participate}} in (Bat III). He had some <b>meaningful</b> health problems about four years ago, but he's been totally healthy {{the last couple of}} years. His health in no way impacted on his involvement in the Bat Out of Hell project.|$|E
5|$|The Landis Center, Lafayette College's {{community}} outreach program, {{provides students with}} service opportunities. Landis' mission is to cultivate personal, civic and intellectual growth for students through <b>meaningful</b> and effective service experiences. The program also strives to foster college-community partnerships {{that contribute to the}} well-being of the community, both locally and globally.|$|E
5|$|The march did, however, make {{specific}} demands: an end {{to racial}} segregation in public schools; <b>meaningful</b> civil rights legislation, including a law prohibiting racial discrimination in employment; protection of civil rights workers from police brutality; a $2 minimum wage for all workers; and self-government for Washington, D.C., then governed by congressional committee.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} <b>meaningful</b> non-manual signals in ASL. This may include {{movement}} of the eyebrows, the cheeks, the nose, the head, the torso, and the eyes.|$|E
5|$|Although {{individuals}} with Asperger syndrome acquire language skills without significant general delay and their speech typically lacks significant abnormalities, language acquisition and use is often atypical. Abnormalities include verbosity, abrupt transitions, literal interpretations and miscomprehension of nuance, use of metaphor <b>meaningful</b> {{only to the}} speaker, auditory perception deficits, unusually pedantic, formal or idiosyncratic speech, and oddities in loudness, pitch, intonation, prosody, and rhythm. Echolalia has also been observed in {{individuals with}} AS.|$|E
5|$|English writing also {{includes}} a system of punctuation {{that is similar to}} the system of punctuation marks used in most alphabetic languages around the world. The purpose of punctuation is to mark <b>meaningful</b> grammatical relationships in sentences to aid readers in understanding a text and to indicate features important for reading a text aloud.|$|E
5|$|Frank and the CCAF's {{position}} against coupon settlements {{was expressed}} in his written {{objection to the}} case in which he stated that they often do not provide <b>meaningful</b> compensation to class members, they often fail to disgorge ill-gotten gains from the defendant, and they often require class members to do future business with the defendant {{in order to receive}} compensation.|$|E
5|$|Opposition MPs {{complained that}} several {{recommendations}} for access-to-information reform were {{omitted from the}} bill, and were instead sent to committee for further review. New Democratic Party MP Pat Martin suggested that this deferral could delay <b>meaningful</b> reform for the foreseeable future. Martin later {{made a deal with}} Baird to give the bill an easy passage through committee, in return for the Conservatives accepting some NDP amendments.|$|E
5|$|Other themes include {{chance and}} coincidence. During Chasing Vermeer, Charles Fort's book, Lo!, inspires the {{children}} to list {{and pay attention to}} coincidences as they realize that they are more than what they seem and explore the concept that they make up one unexplained pattern. Balliett stated that she wanted to convey how coincidences were noticeable and felt <b>meaningful,</b> and how they could matter even if they were unexplainable.|$|E
5|$|Television {{broadcasts}} of Paralympic Games {{began in}} 1976, but this early coverage {{was confined to}} taped-delay releases to one nation or region. At the 1992 Summer Paralympics there were 45hours of live coverage but it was available only in Europe. Other countries broadcast highlight packages during the Games. No <b>meaningful</b> improvements in coverage occurred until the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney.|$|E
5|$|The Columbia {{report also}} found a failure in journalistic {{standards}} by either not making contact with the people they were publishing derogatory information about, or when they did, by not providing enough context {{for people to be}} able to offer a <b>meaningful</b> response. The report also states that the article misled readers with quotes where attribution was unclear and used pseudonyms inappropriately as a way to address these shortcomings.|$|E
5|$|The Temple of the Warriors bears {{iconography}} depicting feathered serpents {{associated with}} Quetzalcoatl or Kukulcan. This {{means that the}} building's alignment towards the place on the horizon where Venus first appears in the evening sky (when it coincides with the rainy season) may be <b>meaningful.</b> However, since both the date and the azimuth of this event change continuously, a solar interpretation of this orientation is much more likely.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. had granted full de jure {{recognition}} to all three Baltic states by July 1922. The recognitions were granted during the shift from the Democratic administration of Woodrow Wilson to the Republican administration of Warren Harding. While the U.S. did not sponsor any <b>meaningful</b> political or economic initiatives in the region during the interwar period, and its administrations did not consider the states strategically important, it maintained normal diplomatic relations with the states.|$|E
5|$|The WHO 2008 {{classification}} of {{acute myeloid leukemia}} attempts to be more clinically useful and to produce more <b>meaningful</b> prognostic information than the FAB criteria. Each of the WHO categories contains numerous descriptive subcategories {{of interest to the}} hematopathologist and oncologist; however, most of the clinically significant information in the WHO schema is communicated via categorization into one of the subtypes listed below.|$|E
5|$|The revamped Library, {{opened in}} 2013, {{features}} dedicated study areas, a small platform to hold forums and press conferences, {{as well as}} three discussion rooms available for student-teacher consultations, projects and group studies. The Nest, a dedicated maker-space which was opened in March 2017, allows students to design, construct or modify <b>meaningful</b> or handy items with specialised tools in the lab, and supports the school's Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Applied Learning Programme (STEM ALP).|$|E
5|$|Vocabulary {{development}} is a process by which people acquire words. Babbling shifts towards <b>meaningful</b> speech as infants grow and produce their first words around the age of one year. In early word learning, infants build their vocabulary slowly. By the age of 18 months, infants can typically produce about 50 words and begin to make word combinations.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1 was {{initially}} expected to work {{only through the}} Saturn encounter. When the spacecraft passed the planet in 1980, Sagan proposed {{the idea of the}} space probe taking one last picture of Earth. He pointed out that such a picture would not have had much scientific value, as the Earth would appear too small for Voyagers cameras to make out any detail, {{but it could have been}} <b>meaningful</b> nevertheless as a perspective on our place in the universe.|$|E
5|$|When it {{was founded}} in March 1839 as the {{flagship}} school of what later became the Baltimore City Public Schools, Baltimore City College was charged with providing a unique classics- and liberal arts-based course of study and with holding all members of its school community to the highest standards of academic achievement and personal development. The school's mission is to prepare its students to succeed in the best colleges In the United States. The faculty and staff of the school strive to engage every student in a rigorous university preparatory study of liberal arts, provide strong extended academic and social support services, and to develop students who enjoy studying and learning. The school's ultimate goal is to produce competitive graduates who have an appreciation for scholarship, perform well on <b>meaningful</b> assessments, make <b>meaningful</b> contributions to society, behave with civility and respect, and perform as reasonable leaders.|$|E
25|$|Various {{attempts}} have been made to produce a taxonomy of levels of measurement. The psychophysicist Stanley Smith Stevens defined nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales. Nominal measurements do not have <b>meaningful</b> rank order among values, and permit any one-to-one transformation. Ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values, but have a <b>meaningful</b> order to those values, and permit any order-preserving transformation. Interval measurements have <b>meaningful</b> distances between measurements defined, but the zero value is arbitrary (as in the case with longitude and temperature measurements in Celsius or Fahrenheit), and permit any linear transformation. Ratio measurements have both a <b>meaningful</b> zero value and the distances between different measurements defined, and permit any rescaling transformation.|$|E
25|$|Definition: Writing/forming a <b>meaningful</b> {{character}} or design.|$|E
25|$|Hilbert was {{initially}} a deductivist, but, {{as may be}} clear from above, he considered certain metamathematical methods to yield intrinsically <b>meaningful</b> results and was a realist {{with respect to the}} finitary arithmetic. Later, he held the opinion that there was no other <b>meaningful</b> mathematics whatsoever, regardless of interpretation.|$|E

25|$|Dasein is {{therefore}} enabled to participate authentically in co-creating <b>meaningful</b> truth {{for his life}} as he engages in healthy, <b>meaningful</b> relationships—including in therapy. Where other mainstream approaches discourage dialogue about subjective meaning and truth {{in an effort to}} maintain therapist objectivity and value-neutrality, ontological hermeneutics encourages authentic dialogue between therapist and client that co-creates <b>meaningful,</b> subjective truth to enrich the life of the client. This process not only provides new perspective for the client via the fusing of horizons, but it also serves {{as a model for the}} client to follow when he goes into the world and seeks authentic relationships vital to psychological well-being.|$|E
25|$|Synthesis: A <b>meaningful</b> {{sentence}} {{consists of}} some phrases; Some of these classes {{are divided into}} sub-classes.|$|E
