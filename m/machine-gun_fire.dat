5|$|On {{the night}} of July 17–18, Major Bruce made a {{personal}} reconnaissance ahead of his troops through heavy flanking <b>machine-gun</b> <b>fire.</b> He pushed forward to the outpost lines through heavy artillery and <b>machine-gun</b> <b>fire</b> {{to keep in touch}} with all his company. On October 3–4 he made a personal reconnaissance on the left flank of his division through heavy shell fire and continual sniping and gained information which enabled him to well place his battalion and cover an exposed flank.|$|E
5|$|A Pakistani defence {{official}} reportedly {{admitted that}} {{soldiers in the}} Pakistani border post sitting there {{for the express purpose}} of stopping infiltration fired a few flares, a couple of mortar rounds and one or two bursts of <b>machine-gun</b> <b>fire</b> in that direction.|$|E
5|$|The assault {{began at}} {{daylight}} on 27 March; the 8th Squadron {{moved across the}} plain to Kusr, where their progress was stopped by heavy Turkish small arms fire. The squadron formed a defensive line, while the 1st Squadron moved past them {{on the right and}} captured a small hill. Turkish artillery and <b>machine-gun</b> <b>fire</b> grew heavier all day, and another attempt by the 8th Squadron to move forward at 16:00 also failed. At 19:25 the Turks counter-attacked the 1st Squadron, but were forced to retire. That night patrols were sent to reconnoitre the Turkish positions, so they could be more easily attacked the next day. At dawn on 28 March the entire division tried another attack. The 1st Squadron managed to capture a small trench, but without their artillery support they were unable to move any further forward in the face of heavy Turkish <b>machine-gun</b> <b>fire.</b> All that day and night they managed to hold onto what they had won, waiting for reinforcement to continue the attack.|$|E
50|$|Hewitt {{spent eight}} years as a {{commissioned}} officer in the Parachute Regiment. He was mentioned in dispatches in 2006 during his first tour of Afghanistan. Whilst leading a Platoon attack in Helmand Province, Afghanistan in 2007 on his second tour of duty he received gunshot wounds to the chest and foot from a 7.62 calibre <b>machine-gun</b> <b>fired</b> by insurgents. This resulted in his right-arm becoming permanently paralysed.|$|R
50|$|During the Great War, Thompson {{became an}} expert in machine-gun tactics. In the Meuse-Argonne campaign, he worked out a mass <b>machine-gun</b> <b>firing</b> {{technique}} and attained the rank of lieutenant colonel, having received a battlefield promotion from General John J. Pershing. At twenty-six, he was the youngest lieutenant colonel in the Army. After the cessation of hostilities, Thompson remained in Europe to direct the stockpiling of German weapons with the Army of Occupation.|$|R
50|$|Under {{withering}} fire Agansing Rai and {{his party}} charged a machine-gun. Agansing Rai himself killed three of the crew. When the first position had been taken, he then led a dash on a <b>machine-gun</b> <b>firing</b> from the jungle, where he killed three of the crew, his men accounting for the rest. He subsequently tackled an isolated bunker single-handed, killing all four occupants. The enemy were now so demoralised that they fled and the second post was recaptured.|$|R
5|$|Although {{orders for}} the attack had been hurried and lacking in detail, and the {{strength}} of the defenders unknown, the assaulting force had prevailed, securing the ridge with only limited offensive support. During the fighting one of the B Company platoon commanders, Lieutenant Eric Larsen, who had only the week before led the crossing at Kujin, was killed. One of the section commanders, Corporal Jeff Jones, immediately took command of the 5 Platoon assault, moving from section to section across the steep slope to direct their fire, even while under heavy Chinese mortar and <b>machine-gun</b> <b>fire.</b> He was awarded the US Silver Star for his actions. The successful assault opened the road south, enabling the Middlesex battalion, brigade headquarters and a number of supporting units to withdraw down the road through the Australians, followed by the Argylls. 3 RAR remained behind as a rearguard while the British battalions took up new positions, covering the Chongchon River crossing at Anju. Chinese mortars and <b>machine-gun</b> <b>fire</b> continued to fall on 3 RAR, and at 17:00 a round destroyed the A Company headquarters, killing two men and wounding four others, including Chitts who was evacuated by stretcher.|$|E
5|$|At around 07:00, {{the deer}} on the {{expansive}} lawns of the French colonial-era palace were frightened off as Quốc and Cử—flying American-built A-1 Skyraiders (A1H/AD-6 variant) single-seater ground attack planes—flew low over their target {{to inspect the}} ruling family's residence. On their second run, they dropped bombs and napalm before firing rockets and strafing the presidential compound with <b>machine-gun</b> <b>fire.</b> The two continued their runs for 30 minutes before units loyal to the president arrived and launched a counter-attack.|$|E
5|$|Lt Col Newman {{aboard the}} MGB {{need not have}} landed, but {{he was one of}} the first ashore. One of his first actions was to direct mortar fire onto a gun {{position}} on top of the submarine pens that was causing heavy casualties among the Commandos. He next directed <b>machine-gun</b> <b>fire</b> onto an armed trawler, which was forced to withdraw upriver. Newman organised a defence that succeeded in keeping the increasing numbers of German reinforcements at bay until the demolition parties had completed their tasks.|$|E

25|$|On 18 April 1915, the Morane-Saulnier L of Roland Garros was {{captured}} {{after he was}} shot down behind the German lines. From 1April, Garros had destroyed three German aircraft in the Morane, which carried a <b>machine-gun</b> <b>firing</b> through the propeller arc. Bullets that hit the blades were deflected by small metal wedges. Garros' efforts to burn his aircraft failed to conceal {{the nature of the}} device and the significance of the deflector blades was immediately apparent.

5|$|On 25 September, {{the same}} day the railway group returned, the brigade set out at 06:00 for Amman. Approaching from the north, they would be {{supported}} during the assault by the 2nd Light Horse Brigade. At 10:30 the regiment, with a machine-gun section and an artillery section, was ordered to move forward {{to the left of the}} Canterbury Mounted Rifles. The Turkish defenders were in redoubts surrounded by barbed wire. McCarroll sent a squadron to attack from the west, which came under Turkish <b>machine-gun</b> <b>fire.</b> Covered by the artillery the squadron was gradually able to advance. At 15:30 the reserve squadron galloped forward, dismounted and came under <b>machine-gun</b> <b>fire.</b> The regiment and Canterbury Mounted Rifles pushed forward. The 4th Squadron succeeded in reaching a double redoubt, but just as they were about to charge, sixty of the defenders surrendered and others withdrew along the Wadi Amman. By now the Canterbury Mounted Rifles had galloped into the town and out the other side, capturing the Turkish defences there from the rear. The battle was over and the brigade captured 1,734 prisoners, twenty-seven machine-guns, five artillery pieces, 298 horses and other military supplies. That night the regiment camped in the Wadi Amman.|$|E
5|$|The 5th Division {{attacked}} {{with three}} battalions through the Scherriabeek valley, which were raked by fire from Gheluvelt {{and found the}} valley to be impassable. Polderhoek Château was captured but then relinquished because many weapons were clogged by mud and the position made an awkward salient. The Germans promptly reoccupied the château, swept the area to the west with massed <b>machine-gun</b> <b>fire</b> and counterattacked, which pushed the brigade back to the start line.|$|E
5|$|Agamemnons first {{target service}} took place before her {{modifications}} were completed. On 19 March 1921, she {{was exposed to}} a cloud of poisonous gas {{to determine the effect}} of gas on a battleship. It was found that gas could penetrate the ship via her various openings, but the ship had not been sealed against gas before the trial and no accurate results applicable to a commissioned battleship could be obtained. On 21 September, she was subjected to <b>machine-gun</b> <b>fire</b> by strafing aircraft. These trials showed that such strafing could harass a battleship, but could not impair her fighting or steaming capabilities, and helped to determine protection for bridge personnel.|$|E

50|$|The British reopened {{the tunnel}} beneath the Hawthorn Ridge crater {{three days later}} and reloaded the mine with {{explosives}} for the Battle of the Ancre (13-18 November). The new mine was fired on 13 November in support of an attack on Beaumont-Hamel by the 51st (Highland) Division of V corps. The Scottish infantry advanced from a trench 250 yd from the German lines, half the width of no man's land on 1 July, supported by tanks, an accurate creeping barrage and <b>machine-guns</b> <b>firing</b> {{over the heads of}} the infantry. Beaumont-Hamel was captured and 2,000 German prisoners taken.|$|R
50|$|On 26 September 1917 at Zonnebeke, Belgium, Sergeant Dwyer, {{in charge}} of a Vickers machine-gun during an advance, rushed his gun forward to within 30 yards of an enemy <b>machine-gun,</b> <b>fired</b> point blank at it and killed the crew. He then seized the gun and carried it back across shell-swept ground to the Australian front line. On the {{following}} day, when the position was being heavily shelled, and his Vickers gun was blown up, he took his team through the enemy barrage and fetched a reserve gun which he put into use in the shortest possible time.|$|R
5|$|At 11:00 on 14 November the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, {{the brigade}} vanguard, {{encountered}} Turkish observation posts. The brigade ordered {{an attack on}} the main Turkish defences. The regiment was positioned to cover the left flank. Advancing by troops they came under <b>machine-gun</b> <b>fire.</b> The 3rd Squadron was dispatched to occupy the high ground on the regiment's right while the other squadrons took cover. Then a force of Turkish cavalry appeared to their left. McCarroll sent the 11th Squadron to check on their dispositions and numbers. However, the squadron encountered heavy rifle and <b>machine-gun</b> <b>fire</b> and could not move forward. To assist them, two troops from the 4th Squadron, were ordered to charge on horseback. The two troops captured the position and continued forward, occupying the high ground on the left in front of the Wellington Mounted Rifles. The 3rd Squadron, in reserve, provided covering fire as the 11th Squadron moved forward alongside the 4th on their left. Covered by the 4th Squadron, the 11th Squadron moved forward. At 14:15 the advance troops of the 11th Squadron located, in an orange grove, a Turkish concentration of troops that counter-attacked the regiment. McCarroll, who had kept up with his forward line of troops, ordered the rest of the regiment, including headquarters troops, to move up in support of the 11th Squadron. The 3rd Squadron galloped forward, dismounting just behind the front line, and engaged the Turkish attack with enfilade fire, forcing the Turks to retire.|$|E
5|$|Early {{the next}} day the NZMRB moved towards Katia, with the {{intention}} of attacking a Turkish gun emplacement. The brigade positioned itself between the 2nd Light Horse Brigade on the left and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade on the right. Taking the lead, the regiment advanced close enough by 14:30 to charge the position on horseback, then dismounted and continued the attack on foot, all in the face of heavy rifle and <b>machine-gun</b> <b>fire.</b> No progress was made and they {{spent the rest of the}} day returning fire from cover. The engagement cost the regiment one dead and six wounded.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the growing threat to the Australian base, the {{decision}} was made to reinforce FSB Andersen, with C Company, 3 RAR flown in by the time of the second attack two nights later. The APCs had also been redeployed to cover the south-east ridge and the southern approach from Trang Bom. The communist assault commenced just before midnight on 19 February, this time focussing on the south-east, and was preceded by heavy <b>machine-gun</b> <b>fire.</b> The attack was stopped short of the wire, regardless the forward pits were hit by rifle grenades, while the Assault Pioneer positions were attacked with satchel charges. The only casualties were four Viet Cong killed.|$|E
2500|$|... 27 July: IRA volunteers <b>fired</b> <b>machine-guns</b> and {{a rocket}} at two RUC landrovers from an {{occupied}} house in West Belfast. Four RUC officers were hurt.|$|R
2500|$|At [...] the sky lit {{up behind}} the attacking {{divisions}} and a hurricane bombardment, supplemented by <b>machine-guns</b> <b>firing</b> on fixed lines, fell on the German positions. At [...] the leading British infantry stood up and moved forwards through a mist, with just enough light to recognise German troops. The German infantry were surprised by the intensity and brevity of the bombardment and the rapid onset of the British infantry behind a creeping barrage of high-explosive shells. The II Battalion, Bavarian Infantry Regiment 16 in Longueval had been alerted and sent out four patrols; one disappeared, one ran into a British patrol and two returned with nothing to report. The first wave reached the German wire without a shot and passed over the front line, some of the following waves being engaged by Germans who emerged from underground shelters. A German counter-barrage began and fell into Caterpillar Valley, well behind the infantry.|$|R
50|$|The Merkava is {{equipped}} with a turret 12.7 mm caliber coaxial machine gun, which enables the crew to lay down fairly heavy cover fire without using the main gun (which is relatively ineffective against individual enemy combatants). Like the new remote-operated weapon station, the coaxial <b>machine-gun</b> is <b>fired</b> from inside the tank without exposing the crew to small-arms fire and snipers.|$|R
5|$|At 10:45am on 12 June Private Haines, a sentry on {{the left}} hand flank, warned of the {{approach}} of an Indonesian foot patrol along the river bank. The Australians had sited the ambush to engage targets on the river and were initially at a disadvantage. Ten minutes after the Indonesians were first seen, Private Sneddon, on the extreme left, engaged a group of six Indonesians with a long burst of <b>machine-gun</b> <b>fire,</b> killing two instantly and a third as he ran towards him. Haines subsequently killed a fourth, while a fifth Indonesian continued past him, followed by five others, who then engaged the Australians. The Indonesian patrol continued to advance, taking them towards {{the rear of the}} Australian positions.|$|E
5|$|In March 1941, the 2nd New Zealand Division was one {{of several}} Allied units {{deployed}} to Greece to help prepare for an expected invasion by Italian and German troops. When the invasion began on 6 April 1941, the 20th Battalion briefly saw action at Thermopylae before being withdrawn, but Hinton missed this fighting as he was with the division's reinforcement battalion, which was initially based in Athens before it moved to the port of Kalamata. It had been decided that the Allied forces would abandon Greece; at Kalamata, the reinforcement battalion, along with several thousand other, mainly Australian, troops, was awaiting evacuation. On 28 April, the New Zealanders were waiting for transport when advance units of the German 5th Panzer Division began to attack the town with <b>machine-gun</b> <b>fire</b> and self-propelled 6-inch guns.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the 4th Rifle Battalion, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Colonel Harold Barrowclough and positioned {{a distance from}} the west wall of the ramparts, had carried out scouting expeditions to explore the defences. Gradually, the German posts around the fortifications fell to the attacking platoons of the battalion. As on the northern side of the town, <b>machine-gun</b> <b>fire</b> from the ramparts prevented any further advance. One party reached the outer rampart but became pinned down by gunfire for several hours. By midday, the situation had settled into a temporary stalemate. In the afternoon, some German prisoners of war were sent into the town with an invitation to surrender but this approach was rebuffed, as had been a similar attempt earlier that morning.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the left}} flank, the 15th Brigade of the 5th Division, {{attacked}} with one battalion forward {{and one in}} support. German artillery-fire before zero hour was so extensive, that most of a company of the forward battalion was buried and the Stokes mortars knocked out. The support battalion was pushed forward and both advanced on time into {{the west end of}} the wood, where they linked with the 99th Brigade. The attack on Longueval was hampered by the German barrage to the south, which cut communications and by several <b>machine-guns</b> <b>firing</b> from the village. An attempt by the Germans to reinforce the garrison from Flers failed, when British artillery-fire fell between the villages but the German infantry held out {{at the north end of}} Longueval. A British line was eventually established from the north-west of Delville Wood, south-west into the village, below the orchards at Duke Street and Piccadilly. A German counter-attack began at [...] from the east end of Delville Wood against the 99th Brigade.|$|R
50|$|At 19:15 as the {{bombardment}} lifted, the 16th Battalion {{climbed out of}} Monash Valley and as they cleared the ridge, came under heavy Turkish small arms fire, from The Nek and the Chessboard, to their rear. Advancing a few yards the battalion started digging in, extending the forward trench of Quinn's Post. Another section of the battalion occupied an abandoned Turkish trench 5 yd from the opposite crest, {{and the rest of}} the battalion fought and extended their trenches through the night. However supplying the forward troops was difficult during the night and impossible during daylight, with the Turkish <b>machine-guns</b> <b>firing</b> from their rear. At daylight the Australians charged another Turkish trench about 80 yd, Turkish machine-guns on Baby 700 opened fire and forced them back. The Turks started moving forwards towards the Australians trench, when around 05:00 an shell from an ANZAC battery landed behind them and part of the 16th Battalion withdrew back to their start position.|$|R
50|$|At 3:20 a.m., the sky lit {{up behind}} the attacking {{divisions}} and a hurricane bombardment, supplemented by <b>machine-guns</b> <b>firing</b> on fixed lines, fell on the German positions. At 3:25 a.m. the leading British infantry stood up and moved forwards through a mist, with just enough light to recognise German troops. The German infantry were surprised by the intensity and brevity of the bombardment and the rapid onset of the British infantry behind a creeping barrage of high-explosive shells. The II Battalion of Bavarian Infantry Regiment 16 in Longueval had been alerted and sent out four patrols, one disappeared, one ran into a British patrol and two returned with nothing to report.

5|$|On 10 April, Rane got {{up early}} and resumed work on an {{obstacle}} {{that had not been}} cleared the previous night. Within a span of two hours, he cleared the roadblock of five large pine trees in the midst of mines and <b>machine-gun</b> <b>fire.</b> This allowed the 4th Dogra Battalion to advance another thirteen kilometers until it encountered another major roadblock. The Pakistani forces were situated on the adjoining hills and able to fire on all approaches to the block, making its destruction problematic. Rane drove a tank to the roadblock and took cover behind the tank while blasting open the roadblock with mines, opening the road {{before the end of the}} night.|$|E
5|$|On 17 November, {{fighting}} for the main position around Sattelberg commenced. The previous night, in order {{to prepare for the}} attack on the 2200 feature, the 2/48th Battalion captured Green Ridge, a small but important feature that dominated the Sattelberg road. The capture of the ridge secured a start line forward of Jivevaneng for Whitehead's 26th Brigade to launch the first stage of their attack upon Sattelberg. The following day, the 2/48th Battalion handed over responsibility for the defence of the ridge to a company from the 2/23rd Battalion, and the attack commenced amidst heavy supporting artillery and <b>machine-gun</b> <b>fire.</b> In response, the Japanese artillery from Sattelberg fired a limited barrage onto the Australians on Green Ridge.|$|E
5|$|On 3 August, {{still with}} the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, the {{regiment}} returned to Katia. Forming the vanguard, they came under Turkish fire on their approach, and as Katia appeared {{to be held in}} strength by the Turks, the brigade set up a line of observation posts to monitor them until nightfall. They then retired to Maler, unknowingly being followed by the Turks. At 23:30 the 1st Light Horse Brigade reported movement to their front, and thirty minutes later shots were exchanged at Mount Meredith and Hod El Enna. The regiment had just settled down for the night and were ordered to stand to. At 02:15 4 August, fighting broke out along the front line and two hours later the 1st Light Horse Brigade carried out a fighting withdrawal. At dawn the regiment was the brigade reserve behind the 6th and 7th Light Horse Regiments. By 05:00 the Turkish force was outflanking both their defences and the ANZAC Mounted Division headquarters, which was co-located at the regiment's position. Two hours later they were ordered to gallop to the front line. Riding through rifle and <b>machine-gun</b> <b>fire,</b> they moved to the left and rear of the 6th and 7th Light Horse Regiments. Once the regiment's position was established, the Australian regiments pulled back to form a line with them. As the Turks advanced and occupied the ridge line previously held by the light horse, they brought artillery and <b>machine-gun</b> <b>fire</b> down onto the division's rear areas. The situation appeared serious, and the regiment's clerks were ordered to burn all their papers. Just before 10:00 reinforcements, consisting of a yeomanry regiment, two Scottish infantry companies and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, arrived and began attacking the Turkish left. By 18:00 they had captured the position. The regiment's casualties during the day were twenty-four wounded.|$|E
50|$|On {{the left}} flank, the 15th Brigade of the 5th Division, {{attacked}} with one battalion forward {{and one in}} support.

A German counter-attack began at 9:30 a.m., from the east end of Delville Wood against the 99th Brigade.|$|R
50|$|The {{nationalist}} gunmen {{fired the}} first {{shots at the}} RUC, who responded by <b>firing</b> <b>machine-guns</b> down the streets, killing two Catholic civilians (Samuel McLarnon, 27, and Michael Lynch, 28) and wounding ten more.|$|R
50|$|Secondary to the airship, Tom {{needs to}} {{conceive}} {{of a way to}} neutralize recoil from the guns which he plans to mount: two 4-inch cannon, and several unspecified <b>machine-guns.</b> When <b>fired,</b> the cannon would generate enough recoil to rip the ship apart, but Tom is inspired by Ned's observation of how an automatic door closer operates. Tom's invention is similar to the recoil system used in the French 75mm field gun.|$|R
