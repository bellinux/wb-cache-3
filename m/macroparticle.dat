50|$|The {{collective}} beam motion may {{be modeled}} {{in a variety}} of ways. One may use <b>macroparticle</b> models, or else a continuum model. The evolution equation in the latter case is typically called the Vlasov equation, and requires one to write down the Hamiltonian function including the external magnetic fields, and the self interaction. Stochastic effects may be added by generalizing to the Fokker-Planck equation.|$|E
50|$|The real systems studied {{are often}} {{extremely}} large {{in terms of}} the number of particles they contain. In order to make simulations efficient or at all possible, so-called super-particles are used. A super-particle (or <b>macroparticle)</b> is a computational particle that represents many real particles; it may be millions of electrons or ions in the case of a plasma simulation, or, for instance, a vortex element in a fluid simulation. It is allowed to rescale the number of particles, because the Lorentz force depends only on the charge to mass ratio, so a super-particle will follow the same trajectory as a real particle would.|$|E

40|$|The {{velocity}} {{distribution of}} carbon <b>macroparticles</b> have been measured using a simple optical technique with a gated charged-coupled device camera, ultilizing the lightemitted by the incandescently bright particles. Distributions have been separately determined for <b>macroparticles</b> which have {{and have not}} experienced collisions with a solid wall (the anode). The measured velocities {{are in the range}} 10 - 370 m s- 1. The distribution without wall collinsions peaks at 80 m s- 1, while the distribution of particles with wall collisions peaks at about 50 m s- 1. This indicates that, in the average, about one-third of the kinetic energy islost to the wall when a collision occurs, assuming <b>macroparticles</b> remained intact. However, it is shown that most carbon <b>macroparticles</b> fracture into even smaller particles when colliding with a surface. The velocity measurements do not include either very small (submicrometre) or cooled-off particles...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of cooling processes over minutes or hours of real time are usually carried out using direct {{solution of the}} Fokker-Planck equation. However, by using scaling rules derived from that equation, {{it is possible to}} use <b>macroparticle</b> representations of the beam distribution. Besides having applications for cooling alone, the <b>macroparticle</b> approach allows combining the cooling process with other dynamical processes which are represented by area-preserving maps. A time-scaling rule derived from the Vlasov equation can be used to adjust the time step of a map-based dynamics calculation to one more suitable for combining with a <b>macroparticle</b> Fokker-Planck calculation. The time scaling for the Vlasov equation is also useful for substantially more rapid calculations when a <b>macroparticle</b> model of a conservative multiparticle system requires a large number of macroparticles to faithfully produce the collective potential or when the model must simulate a long time period...|$|E

40|$|The {{deformation}} of biological <b>macroparticles</b> such as DNA and proteins in a flow {{has been a}} subject of great important {{in the last decade}} due to the interest in single molecule analysis. In this paper, a multiscale flow-macroparticle interaction numerical method was developed to analyze {{deformation of}} biological <b>macroparticles</b> in uniform flows. To bridge the gap between huge scale differences between the protein dynamics (in Pico scales) and the underlying hydrodynamics (from nano to micro scales), a hybrid coarse-grained model is coupled with the continuum Navier-Stokes solver. Based on the Gō-type modeling, biological dynamics is governed by the Langevin equation for which the biological <b>macroparticles</b> are represented by a collection of micro-sized spherical beads that are tethered by harmonic potentials. The velocity vector is coupled through the friction factors, which are amino acid dependent, in the stochastic Langevin equation. With this model, simulation results show that flow may stretch biological <b>macroparticles</b> to partially unravel stationary conformations that depend on the flow rate and on the terminus which is anchored. These features potentially offer richer diagnostic results to investigate biological <b>macroparticles</b> configuration process, as compared to force clamp results using Atomic Force Microscopy...|$|R
40|$|Cathodic arc {{evaporation}} (CAE) is {{a widely}} used technique for generating highly ionised plasma from which hard, wear-resistant PVD coatings can be deposited. A major drawback of this technique is the emission of micrometer-sized droplets of cathode material from the arc spot, which are {{commonly referred to as}} ‘macroparticles’. In this study, the effect of cathode poisoning was investigated as a method {{to reduce the number of}} <b>macroparticles</b> in PVD coatings. While the study focuses on the reduction of <b>macroparticles</b> in titanium nitride coatings, the outcomes and key findings can be broadly applied to the cathodic arc process, in particular, for the reduction of <b>macroparticles</b> in more advanced CAE coatings. The results support earlier findings that have shown that poisoning of the cathode can reduce the number of <b>macroparticles</b> emitted from the arc spot. The results of glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GD-OES) showed that the titanium content of the coatings varied little between the respective coatings despite changes in the deposition pressure from 0. 1 to 1. 2 Pa. The GD-OES results also showed the presence of oxide contamination at the surface of the coatings, which was significantly reduced with increasing deposition pressure. The coatings were also deposited onto high-speed steel twist drills to compare the metal-cutting performance when dry drilling a workpiece of cast iron. The results of the drill tests showed that tool life increased with a reduction in the number of <b>macroparticles.</b> <br /...|$|R

40|$|<b>Macroparticle</b> {{simulation}} {{plays an}} important role in modern accelerator design and operation. Most linear rf accelerators have been designed based on <b>macroparticle</b> simulations using longitudinal position as the independent variable. In this paper, we have done a systematic comparison between using longitudinal position as the independent variable and using time as the independent variable in <b>macroparticle</b> simulations. We have found that, for an rms-matched beam, the maximum relative moment difference for second, fourth moments and beam maximum amplitudes between these two types of simulations is 0. 25 % in a 10 m reference transport system with physical parameters similar to the Spallation Neutron Source linac design. The maximum z-to- t transform error in the space-charge force calculation of the position dependent simulation is about 0. 1 % in such a system. This might cause a several percent error in a complete simulation of a linac with a length of hundreds of meters. Furthermore, the error may be several times larger in simulations of mismatched beams. However, if such errors are acceptable to the linac designer, then one is justified in using position dependent <b>macroparticle</b> simulations in this type of linac design application...|$|E

40|$|Characterization of <b>macroparticles</b> in TiN films {{prepared}} by an are ion-plating method on AISI {{304 stainless steel}} {{was carried out by}} energy filtering transmission electron microscopy. The results show that most of the <b>macroparticles</b> have the shape of a bud, which has the equiaxial polycrystalline Ti metal located at the bottom center. The outerlayer consists of TiN 0. 26, alpha -TiN 0. 3 and Ti 2 N, in addition to TiN, identified by selected area diffraction. On the basis of the analysis, a model describing the formation of <b>macroparticles</b> in the are ion-plated TiN is proposed. Once emitted from the cathode, the liquid Ti droplets react with nitrogen during their migration to the substrate and form a thin layer of titanium nitrides {{on the surface of the}} droplets, resulting in a core-shell structure. As a result of the high-melting outshell, flattened torus voids are produced, upon impact on the substrate, beneath each particle which causes shadowing of the ion flux during deposition. Subsequent growth of TiN follows the orientation of the titanium nitride nuclei in the outshell to form a radial type structure, until coalescence with the regular TiN columns grown perpendicular to the substrate surface occurs.

40|$|Known arc sources have, {{among other}} things, the {{disadvantage}} that <b>macroparticles</b> on the substrate to be coated negatively affect layer characteristics.

The known arc source has a pot-shaped cathode housing with a cooled jacket. The target (cathode) is directly attached to its thin-walled base and is replaceable. The magnet system is mounted in a rotatable bearing in the cathode housing directly under the base. The power supply unit for the arc current is connected to an electronic detector, a limiter and a controller in order to program and control the operating parameters of the arc source. The arc source is used for vacuum-coating of electrically conducting layers, preferably for tools, where high wear and tear resistance, adhesive strength and corrosion resistance are demanded...|$|R
40|$|Commercially {{available}} multilayer TiN/(Ti,AI) N coatings deposited onto {{stainless steel}} substrates {{have been evaluated}} {{with respect to their}} microstructure and deformation mechanisms. The microstructure and chemical composition have been investigated using a combination of scanning electron microscopy cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. The multilayer exhibited a columnar structure extending throughout the film thickness. Micrometer-sized <b>macroparticles</b> were present at various distances from the substrate, being incorporated in the growing film in the solid state. They consisted of a core structure with equiaxed grains having the alpha-Ti phase and an outer layer of TiN. Nanoindentation testing was used to explore the deformation mechanisms operating in the coated system. Analysis of the load-displacement curves showed that they were useful in identifying the occurrence of cracking. By cross-sectioning the nanoindentations, the deformation was observed to occur along the columnar grain boundaries and in the layers parallel to the interfaces. The effect of the <b>macroparticles</b> in the deformation mechanisms has been observed and will be discussed...|$|R

If the initial action variable of the accelerating particles is small, rapid phase bunching occurs and the particle population is condensed into a single <b>macroparticle</b> in phase space. As a result, this low-dimensional state is predominantly regular. For larger energies, on the other hand, there is no <b>macroparticle</b> formation.

The comparison of a <b>macroparticle</b> model with the existing theory indicates interesting discrepancies, although the theoretical threshold is confirmed.

40|$|Unphysical {{heating and}} <b>macroparticle</b> {{trapping}} {{that arise in}} the numerical modeling of laser wakefield accelerators using particle-in-cell codes are investigated. A dark current free laser wakefield accelerator stage, in which no trapping of background plasma electrons into the plasma wave should occur, and a highly nonlinear cavitated wake with self-trapping, are modeled. Numerical errors can lead to errors in the <b>macroparticle</b> orbits in both phase and momentum. These errors grow {{as a function of}} distance behind the drive laser and can be large enough to result in unphysical trapping in the plasma wake. The resulting numerical heating in intense short-pulse laser-plasma interactions grows much faster and to a higher level than the known numerical grid heating of an initially warm plasma in an undriven system. The amount of heating, at least in the region immediately behind the laser pulse, can, in general, be decreased by decreasing the grid size, increasing the number of particles per cell, or using smoother interpolation methods. The effect of numerical heating on <b>macroparticle</b> trapping is less severe in a highly nonlinear cavitated wake, since trapping occurs in the first plasma wave period immediately behind the laser pulse...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{concerned the}} corrosion behaviour of <b>macroparticle</b> and growth defects in PVD CrN/NbN superlattice coatings formed by are bond-sputtering (ABS) process on a mild steel BS 6323. The electrochemical behaviour of the coatings was firstly studied by potentiodynamic polarising in de-aerated 0. 5 M (Na 2 CO 3 -NaHCO 3) buffer and 5 % NaCl solutions, respectively. The coating and defects were then examined in planar view and cross-section by scanning electron microscopic analyses {{and the results}} were compared with those prior to the electrochemical measurement. It is found that the overall coating/substrate corrosion process is closely related to the deleterious effect of the macroparticles and growth defects in the PVD coatings. It is further demonstrated that for through thickness <b>macroparticle</b> inclusions, corrosion initiates by galvanic or crevice corrosion between the defect and the coating matrix, subsequently permitting solution access to those defects with eventual substrate pitting and corrosion at the coating/substrate interface. On the basis of the experimental findings and the <b>macroparticle</b> formation theory, the mechanisms of the growth defect-related coating/substrate corrosion are finally proposed.

40|$|A {{numerical}} algorithm for simulating {{electron beam}} shot noise in free electron lasers (FELs) is presented. Shot noise {{is a source}} of spontaneous emission that may be amplified in the self-amplified spontaneous emission regime of operation. This regime is of great importance to XUV and x-ray FELs where the spontaneous emission is currently the only effective source available for amplification. The algorithm uses a quasiuniform phase-space distribution of appropriately charge weighted <b>macroparticles.</b> The statistical properties of the <b>macroparticles</b> are derived directly from the temporal Poisson statistical properties of the real electron distribution. Unlike previous algorithms, ours does not rely upon any averaging over a resonant radiation period time scale and so more correctly describes the underlying physics. The algorithm also allows shot noise to be modeled self-consistently in unaveraged FEL models which are able to describe subwavelength phenomena such as coherent spontaneous emission (CSE). The algorithm is used in the unaveraged 1 D FEL numerical simulation code FemFel and demonstrates spontaneous emission due to shot noise and CSE in both rectangular and Gaussian electron pulse current profiles. The preliminary results show good qualitative and quantitative agreement with theory...|$|R

40|$|Laser driven accelerators {{are capable}} of {{producing}} multi nC, multi MeV electron beams with transverse and longitudinal sizes {{on the order of}} microns. To investigate the transport of such electron bunches, a fast and fully relativistic space charge code which can handle beams with arbitrarily large energy spread has been developed. A 6 -D <b>macroparticle</b> model for the beam is used to calculate the space charge fields at each time step. The collection of macroparticles is divided into longitudinal momentum bins, each with a small spread in relative momentum. The <b>macroparticle</b> distribution in each momentum bin is decomposed into ellipsoidal shells in position space. For each shell, an analytical expression for the electrostatic force in the bin rest frame is used. The total space charge force acting on one <b>macroparticle</b> in the lab frame is then the vector sum of the Lorentz-transformed forces from all the momentum bins. We have used this code to study the evolution of typical beams emerging from the plasma in the two most popular schemes, i. e., the self-modulated laser-wakefield-accelerator, where the laser pulse size is many times the plasma wavelength (L >> lr), and the colliding pulse laser-wakefield-accelerator regime where L-lr and two counter propagating laser pulses are used to inject electrons into the wakefield...|$|E
