50|$|Presently {{there is}} no {{agreed-upon}} terminology of comorbidity. Some authors bring forward different meanings of comorbidity and <b>multi-morbidity,</b> defining the former, {{as the presence of}} a number of diseases in a patient, connected to each other through proven pathogenetic mechanisms and the latter, as the presence of a number of diseases in a patient, not having any connection to each other through any of the proven till date pathogenetic mechanisms. Others affirm that <b>multi-morbidity</b> is the combination of a number of chronic or acute diseases and clinical symptoms in a person and do not stress the similarities or differences in their pathogenesis. However the principle clarification of the term was given by H. C. Kraemer and M. van den Akker, determining comorbidity as the combination in a patient of 2 or more chronic diseases (disorders), pathogenetically related to each other or coexisting in a single patient independent of each disease's activity in the patient.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges in this field of health care is dealing with the co-existence of multiple disorders, which is called <b>multi-morbidity.</b> There are few incentives within current health care systems to coordinate care across multiple providers and varying services. [...] A 2001 survey by Mathematica Policy Research found that physicians feel they have inadequate training to deal with multiple chronic conditions. An {{increase in the number of}} chronic conditions correlates with an increase in the number of inappropriate hospitalizations. [...] Self-management can be challenging because recommended activities for one condition may be made difficult because of another condition.|$|E
5000|$|The European Union {{has decided}} to include a small set of health expectancies among its European Community Health Indicators (ECHI) to provide {{synthetic}} measures of disability, chronic morbidity, and perceived health. Therefore the Minimum European Health Module (MEHM), composed of 3 general questions covering these dimensions, has been introduced into the Eurostat EU-Statistics on Income and Living Conditions Survey (EU-SILC) to improve the comparability of health expectancies between countries. In addition life expectancy without long term activity limitation, based on the disability question, was selected in 2004 {{to be one of}} the structural indicators to be examined every year, during the European Spring Council for assessing the EU strategic goals (Lisbon Strategy) under the name of “Healthy Life Years” (HLY). Furthermore the European Union is co-funding a Joint Action on Chronic Diseases and Promoting Healthy Ageing across the Life Cycle (CHRODIS-JA). This aims to promote and facilitate a process of exchange and transfer of good practices between European countries and regions, addressing chronic conditions, with a specific focus on health promotion and prevention of chronic conditions, <b>multi-morbidity</b> and diabetes.|$|E
30|$|The {{association}} between older age, female gender and injury/poisoning is {{also consistent with}} existing literature. Declining health, <b>multi-morbidities,</b> cognitive dysfunction and depression may contribute to accidental and deliberate poisoning as well as age-related physiological changes and poly-pharmacy can affect the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of drugs, making elderly more susceptible to toxicity [52, 53]. Cassidy et al. [52] reported a female/male ratio of 1.6 within a sample of elderly who experienced poisoning. These events occurred mainly in a domestic setting (87  %) while nursing home represents the second place of occurrence (4.5  %).|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Health {{disparity}} between {{urban and rural}} regions in Australia is well-documented. In the Wheatbelt catchments of Western Australia there is higher incidence and rate of avoidable hospitalisation for chronic diseases. Structured care approach to chronic illnesses is not new but the {{focus has been on}} single disease state. A recent ARC Discovery Project on general practice nurse-led chronic disease management of diabetes, hypertension and stable ischaemic heart disease reported improved communication and better medical administration. [1] In our study we investigated the sustainability of such a <b>multi-morbidities</b> general practice –led collaborative model of care in rural Australia. METHODS A QUAN(qual) design was utilised. Eight pairs of rural general practices were matched. Inclusion criteria used were > 18 years and capable of giving informed consent, at least one identified risk factor or diagnosed with chronic conditions. Patients were excluded if deemed medically unsuitable. A comprehensive care plan was formulated by the respective general practice nurse in consultation with the treating General Practitioner (GP) and patient based on the individual’s readiness to change, and was informed by available local resource. A case management approach was utilised. Shediaz-Rizkallah and Lee’s conceptual framework on sustainability informed our evaluation. [2] Our primary outcome on measures of sustainability was reduction in avoidable hospitalisation. Secondary outcomes were patients and practitioners acceptance and satisfaction, and changes to pre-determined interim clinical and process outcomes. RESULTS The qualitative interviews highlighted the community preference for a ‘sustainable’ local hospital in addition to general practice. Costs, ease of access, low prioritisation of self chronic care, workforce turnover and perception of losing another local resource if underutilised influenced the respondents’ decision to present at local hospital for avoidable chronic diseases regardless. CONCLUSIONS Despite the pragmatic nature of rural general practice in Australia, the sustainability of chronic <b>multi-morbidities</b> management in general practice require efficient integration of primary-secondary health care and consideration of other social determinants of health. What this study adds: What is already known on this subject: Structured approach to chronic disease management is not new and {{has been shown to be}} effective for reducing hospitalisation. However, the focus has been on single disease state. What does this study add: Sustainability of collaborative model of <b>multi-morbidities</b> care require better primary-secondary integration and consideration of social determinants of health. ...|$|R
40|$|Aortic {{stenosis}} (AS) is {{the term}} {{used to describe the}} narrowing of the valve within the aorta (aortic valve). The restricted opening of the valve results in the obstruction of the left ventricular outflow leading to a reduced volume of blood entering the systemic circulation.

English hospitals during the financial year 2012 - 13. All admitted patients aged 65 years and over. By using exploratory analysis (correspondence analysis) we identify <b>multi-morbidity</b> groups based on 20 target conditions whose hospital prevalence was ≥ 1 %. We examined a total of 2788900 hospital admissions. <b>Multi-morbidity</b> was highly prevalent, 62. 8 % had 2 or more of the targeted conditions while 4. 7 % had six or more. <b>Multi-morbidity</b> increased with age from 56 % (65 - 69 yr age-groups) up to 67 % (80 - 84 yr age-group). The average <b>multi-morbidity</b> was 3. 2 ± 1. 2 (SD). Correspondence analysis revealed 3 distinct groups of older patients.

40|$|Background: <b>Multi-morbidity</b> among elderly is {{increasingly}} {{recognized as a}} major public health challenge {{in most of the}} developing countries. However, information on the size of population suffering from <b>multi-morbidity</b> and socio-economic differentials of <b>multi-morbidity</b> is scarce. The objectives of this paper are twofold; first, to assess the prevalence of various chronic conditions and morbidity among rural elderly and second, to examine the socio-economic and demographic factors that {{have a significant effect on}} the morbidity. Methods: A cross-sectional survey has been done using multi-stage random sampling procedure that was conducted among elderly (60 + years) in Bargarh District of Odisha during October 2011 -February 2012. The survey was conducted among 310 respondents including 153 males and 157 females.

40|$|SUMMARY Female {{aging is}} a process that {{involves}} hypoestrogenism time, the individual impact on each woman, and what we can do as experts to reduce morbidity and provide quality of life. This natural process in the female life cycle has been of concern to women after menopause. Changes in different biophysical and psychosocial aspects, and their individual experiences, have repercussions on the lives of patients seeking specialized and multidisciplinary support to reduce the harmful effects of prolonged hypoestrogenism. Overweight and obesity, inadequate living habits and the presence of <b>multi-morbidities</b> cause damage to the quality of life and impact the functional capacity. Behavioral prescription and hormone therapy are among the treatments given to ease symptoms and reduce morbidity. A better understanding of these factors can help identify groups that require more care after menopause...|$|R

This study investigated the prevalence of <b>multi-morbidity</b> in the Serbia population and assessed the co-occurrence of chronic diseases by age and gender. We analyzed data from the 2013 National Health Survey, which included 13, 103 individuals ≥ 20 years old. <b>Multi-morbidity</b> patterns were identified by exploratory factor analysis of data on self-reported chronic diseases, as well as data on measured body weight and height. The analysis was stratified by age and gender. <b>Multi-morbidity</b> was present in nearly one-third of respondents (26. 9 %) and existed in all age groups, with the highest prevalence among individuals aged 65 years and older (47. 2 % of men and 65. 0 % of women). Six patterns of <b>multi-morbidity</b> were identified: non-communicable, cardio-metabolic, respiratory, cardiovascular, aggregate, and mechanical/mental/metabolic.

40|$|Background: Gait disorders, {{a highly}} {{prevalent}} condition in older adults, {{are associated with}} several adverse health consequences. Gait analysis allows qualitative and quantitative assessments of gait that improves the understanding of mechanisms of gait disorders and the choice of interventions. This manuscript aims (1) to give consensus guidance for clinical and spatiotemporal gait analysis based on the recorded footfalls in older adults aged 65 years and over, and (2) to provide reference values for spatiotemporal gait parameters based on the recorded footfalls in healthy older adults free of cognitive impairment and <b>multi-morbidities.</b> Methods: International experts working in a network of two different consortiums (i. e., Biomathics and Canadian Gait Consortium) participated in this initiative. First, they identified items of standardized information following the usual procedure of formulation of consensus findings. Second, they merged databases including spatiotemporal gait assessments with GAITRite® system and clinical information from the “Gait, cOgnitiOn & Decline” (GOOD) initiative and the Generation 100 (Gen 100) study. Only healthy—free of cognitive impairment and <b>multi-morbidities</b> (i. e., ≤ 3 therapeutics taken daily) —participants aged 65 and older were selected.

40|$|Two-thirds {{of people}} aged ≥ 65 years have <b>multi-morbidity,</b> with {{people living in}} the most {{deprived}} areas developing <b>multi-morbidity</b> 10 - 15 years even earlier. <b>Multi-morbidity</b> is associated with higher mortality, polypharmacy and high treatment burden, higher rates of adverse drug events, and much greater health services use including emergency hospital admissions. <b>Multi-morbidity</b> includes both physical and mental health conditions, as anxiety and depression, that almost invariably affect patients with multiple symptomatic chronic diseases. The main message of the present paper is that the management of a patient with any of the chronic diseases that are part of <b>multi-morbidity</b> is not just the management of that single index disease, but must include the active search and proper treatment of concomitant chronic diseases. The presence of concomitant chronic diseases should not alter the management of the index disease (eg COPD), and concomitant chronic disease should be treated according to single diseases guidelines regardless of the presence of the index disease, obviously with careful consideration that this choice implies complex management, polypharmacy and potential adverse effects.

40|$|Patient {{expertise}} in self-care is recognised as {{a cornerstone of}} disease management in advanced welfare capitalist societies. When conceptualised within a broader agenda of ‘engaged and active patients’ such expertise is expected to relieve UK NHS resources significantly. However, although self-care {{is first and foremost}} an embodied practice, grounded in the context of everyday life, state sponsored self-care support initiatives such as the Expert Patients Programme operate a dualistic framework separating cognitive and corporeal elements.

Evidence indicates that health systems with strong integrated primary health care (PHC) at their core are both effective and efficient at delivering appropriate services where they are needed most. Although Australia is comparable to New Zealand (NZ), England, Canada, and the United States (US) in terms of expenditure and coverage of PHC, recent evidence suggests that there is room for improvement in Australia on indicators of integration including access, cost, coordination, information sharing and chronic disease management, which may reflect the fact that, for the most part, these countries have been working at ways to achieve integrated health services for longer than Australia...|$|R

During the 2 -year study period, 690 registered patients died ‘totally expectedly and non-suddenly’. These made 709 transitions in the last 3 months, which involved a hospital two times out of three, and covered 43 distinct care trajectories. The most frequent trajectory was home-to-hospital (48 %). Forty-six percent experienced one or more transitions in their last month of life. Male gender, <b>multi-morbidities,</b> and absence of GP awareness of a patient’s wish for place of death were associated with having a transition in the last 30 days of life; age of 85 years, having an infection {{and the absence of}} a palliative-centred treatment goal were associated with terminal hospitalization for 7 days. Although the majority of the ‘totally expected and non-sudden’ deaths occurred at home, transitions to hospitals were relatively frequent.

The review identified 37 studies focussing on <b>multi-morbidity</b> but using conceptually different approaches. Studies focusing on ‘comorbidity’ (i. e. the ‘index disease’ approach) suggested that quality may be enhanced in the presence of synergistic conditions, and impaired by antagonistic or neutral conditions. Studies on ‘multi-morbidity’ (i. e. multiplicity of problems) and ‘morbidity burden’ (i. e. the total severity of conditions) suggested that increasing number of conditions and severity may be associated with better quality of healthcare when measured by process or intermediate outcome indicators, but with worse quality when patient-centred measures are used. However, issues related to the conceptualization and measurement of <b>multi-morbidity</b> (inconsistent across studies) and of healthcare quality (restricted to evaluations for each separate condition without incorporating considerations about <b>multi-morbidity</b> itself and its implications for management) compromised the generalizability of these observations.

The net result of these factors is that between 2004 / 5 and 2014 / 15 there has been a 31 % increase in NHS hospital admissions and a 45 % increase in hospital based operations (NHS Confederation). However, the duration of hospital stays has reduced from just over 8 days, to 5 days over the same time period, and the most common length of stay is one day (The Nuffield Trust). The reality for the patient is that time spent in the presence of nursing, or other healthcare professionals is becoming increasingly limited, particularly in relation to surgical procedures, which are now more commonly offered as day case interventions. How can the nursing profession ensure that a patient’s pain is appropriately assessed and managed in this scenario...|$|R
40|$|The new Australian National Diabetes Strategy {{seeks to}} {{prioritise}} Australia’s response to diabetes, {{and to identify}} approaches to reduce the impact of diabetes in the community. Developing a new Australian National Diabetes Strategy provides a valuable opportunity to evaluate current approaches to diabetes services and care; consider the role of governments at all levels, {{as well as other}} stakeholders; evaluate whether current efforts and investments align with identified needs; maximise the efficient use of existing, limited healthcare resources; and articulate a vision for preventing, detecting, and managing diabetes and for diabetes research efforts. The Australian National Diabetes Strategy will form part of the Government’s overall strategic framework for managing chronic diseases, which recognises the shared health determinants, risk factors and <b>multi-morbidities</b> that exist across a broad range of chronic conditions. We welcome the diverse perspectives, experience and knowledge of all diabetes stakeholders and interested members of the community including people with diabetes, families, carers, health care professionals, researchers, community and non-government organisations, all levels of government, industry and business. Why we are consulting The purpose of this consultation is to seek feedback from the community on the draft Strategic Framework for Action presented in the Consultation Paper {{for the development of the}} Australian National Diabetes Strategy and further inform the development of the Strategy. The consultation paper has been prepared by the National Diabetes Strategy Advisory Group (NDSAG), a committee appointed by the Australian Government. How to give us your view...|$|R
40|$|Given {{the global}} {{increase}} in the number of people over the age of 85, there is a growing body of work concerning this group, termed the oldest old. Much of this work is confined to the literature specialising in geriatrics and the more generic health care papers refer to ‘older people’ with little definition of what is meant by ‘older’. Iatrogenesis (ill health caused by doctors) is a major issue and general practitioners (GPs) need practical help in prescribing for the oldest old. This paper presents a narrative review of the literature on prescribing and the oldest old. The results showed that all papers sourced referred to prescribing for the ‘old’ as those aged over 65, with only scant mention of oldest old. Yet prescribing for the oldest old involves clinical judgement and knowledge of the patient. It includes weighing up what will do good, cause no harm and is acceptable to the individual. GPs have to make treatment choices mostly in isolation from colleagues, during time-limited consultations and with few relevant guidelines on managing <b>multi-morbidities</b> in the oldest old. A major issue in prescribing for people over the age of 85 is that guidelines for diseases are based on trials with younger adults, outline the best practice for one disease in isolation (i. e. not in the presence of other diseases) and take little account of the interactions between the drugs used in managing several diseases in frail older people. There is a growing body of work, however, calling for specialist services for the oldest old...|$|R
40|$|Background Complex {{health systems}} make it {{difficult}} for older persons (75 +) with <b>multi-morbidity</b> to achieve continuity of care. Case management could be one way to address this difficulty. Currently, {{there is a need to}} extend the knowledge regarding case management as experienced by those utilising the services, namely older persons (75 +) with <b>multi-morbidity.</b> The study aimed to explore older persons’ (75 +) with <b>multi-morbidity</b> experiences of case managers. Methods The study design was qualitative and used a focused ethnographic approach. Data was collected through individual interviews with 13 older persons and by participant observations with accompanying field notes, all conducted in 2012 – 2013. Results The data revealed four themes illustrating the older persons’ experiences of case managers: 1) Someone providing me with a trusting relationship; 2) Someone assisting me; 3) Someone who is on my side; and 4) Someone I do not need at present. Conclusions This study illustrates the importance of establishing trusting relationships between older persons and their case managers in order to truly provide assistance. The older persons valued the case managers acting as informed but unbiased facilitators. The findings could be of help in the development of case management interventions better designed for older persons with <b>multi-morbidity...</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: A growing {{proportion}} {{of people are}} living with long term conditions. The majority have more than one. Dealing with <b>multi-morbidity</b> is a complex problem for health systems: for those designing and implementing healthcare {{as well as for}} those providing the evidence informing practice. Yet the concept of <b>multi-morbidity</b> (the presence of > 2 diseases) {{is a product of the}} design of health care systems which define health care need on the basis of disease status. So does the solution lie in an alternative model of healthcare? DISCUSSION: Strengthening generalist practice has been proposed as part of the solution to tackling <b>multi-morbidity.</b> Generalism is a professional philosophy of practice, deeply known to many practitioners, and described as expertise in whole person medicine. But generalism lacks the evidence base needed by policy makers and planners to support service redesign. The challenge is to fill this practice-research gap in order to critically explore if and when generalist care offers a robust alternative to management of this complex problem. We need practice-based evidence to fill this gap. By recognising generalist practice as a 'complex intervention' (intervening in a complex system), we outline an approach to evaluate impact using action-research principles. We highlight the implications for those who both commission and undertake research in order to tackle this problem. SUMMARY: Answers to the complex problem of <b>multi-morbidity</b> won't come from doing more of the same. We need to change systems of care, and so the systems for generating evidence to support that care. This paper contributes to that work through outlining a process for generating practice-based evidence of generalist solutions to the complex problem of person-centred care for people with <b>multi-morbidity...</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Increasing age often implies {{increasing}} frailty, and {{the oldest}} old are often described as a frail group with {{a high risk of}} developing functional impairments and <b>multi-morbidities</b> like falls at home, which often result in dependence in daily activities. This preliminary study evaluate the efficacy of light path coupled with tele-assistance service for preventing unintentional falls at home in a frail elderly population. METHODS: Study design is a longitudinal prospective cohort study from 1 st July 2009 to 30 June 2010. The program included 194 adults aged 65 and over living at home and registered on a list of frail elderly people. Participants were uniformly asked about their history of falls during the year prior to their most recent health examination. The recall period was one year. RESULTS: We observed that 77 (40. 5 %) elderly fell at home, 29 (30. 9 %) in the exposed group and 48 (50. 0 %) in the unexposed group. The use of light path coupled with tele-assistance was significantly associated with the reduction in falls at home, odd ratio= 0. 33 95 %CI [0. 17 - 0. 65] p value= 0. 0012. There was also a greater reduction in post-fall hospitalization rate among exposed group with odd ratio= 0. 30 95 %CI [0. 12 - 0. 74] p value= 0. 0091. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study showed that the use of light path coupled with tele-assistance service significantly reduced the incidence of unintentional falling at home among frail elderly population. This result should be confirmed by a randomized trial...|$|R
40|$|Non-modifiable patient characteristics, {{including}} age, gender, ethnicity {{as well as}} {{the occurrence}} of <b>multi-morbidities,</b> are associated with processes and outcomes of diabetes care. Information on these factors can be used in case mix adjustment of performance measures. However, the practical relevance of such adjustment is not clear. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the strength of associations between patient factors and diabetes care processes and outcomes. We performed an observational study based on routinely collected data of 12, 498 diabetes patients in 59 Dutch primary care practices. Data were collected on patient age, gender, whether the patient lived in a deprived area, body mass index and the co-occurrence of cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression or anxiety. Outcomes included 6 dichotomous measures (3 process and 3 outcome related) regarding glycosylated hemoglobin, systolic blood pressure and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol. We performed separate hierarchical logistic mixed model regression models for each of the outcome measures. Each of the process measure models showed moderate effect sizes, with pooled areas under the curve that varied between 0. 66 and 0. 76. The frequency of diabetes related consultations as a measure of patient compliance to treatment showed the strongest association with all process measures (odds ratios between 5. 6 and 14. 5). The effect sizes of the outcome measure models were considerably smaller than the process measure models, with pooled areas under the curve varying from 0. 57 to 0. 61. Several non-modifiable patient factors could be associated with processes and outcomes of diabetes care. However, associations were small. These results suggest that case-mix correction or stratification in assessing diabetes care has limited practical relevance...|$|R
40|$|Older people {{residing}} {{in nursing homes}} have complex needs requiring the input of nurses skilled in managing <b>multi-morbidities</b> and psychosocial issues. However, in England, nursing homes {{have proven to be}} unappealing work settings for potential staff, while nurses who do work in these settings are often afforded low status. Such contradictions pervade current {{understanding of the nature of}} work in nursing homes. To-date, few studies have investigated the views and experiences of nursing home nurses themselves regarding the contradictions that arise from role and status issues. This study explores English nursing home nurses’ views regarding status and role. The aims of the study were constructed as follows:  To explore the experiences and views of nursing home nurses working with older people regarding their status and role. -To generate an understanding of how and why these experiences and views occur. -To explore whether emerging insights regarding nursing home nursing can inform workforce development processes. The methodology utilised was hermeneutic phenomenology, based upon the philosophies of Gadamer and Iser. Thirteen nurses from seven nursing homes were each interviewed five times using an episodic interview technique. Data analysis methods were adapted from Van Manen’s hermeneutic phenomenological approach, and Iser’s literary reception theory methods. Four categories emerged from the data - nursing ‘residents’ rather than ‘patients’, business role, stigma, and isolation and exclusion. From these categories, three themes were ascertained - uncertainty about role identity, unpreparedness for the demands of the role, and low occupational status. Participants feel uncertain, unprepared and stigmatised because they are positioned at the intersection of health and social care – a location where health and social care funding issues cross, and healthcare and social care work overlaps. Understanding generated from this study can inform workforce development processes...|$|R
