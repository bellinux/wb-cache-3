500|$|In a more {{positive}} review, Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer stated that [...] "Stolen Memory" [...] "does {{a good job of}} justifying itself through enjoyable gameplay and clever storytelling. Short, yes, but also surprisingly sweet." [...] He also highlighted positively the story and opined that the ending [...] "adds more shading to Kasumi's flirtatious character", stating that [...] "the obligatory moral choice at the end is dictated by intimate emotional considerations rather than battlefield pragmatism." [...] Eduardo Reboucas of Game Revolution criticized the fact that the story does not fit in a post-story scenario, stating that [...] "Stolen Memory" [...] "is intended to be played as you're <b>making</b> <b>your</b> way through the suicide mission storyline and not in the aftermath." ...|$|E
500|$|In Work Suspended and Other Stories [...] Waugh {{introduced}} [...] "real" [...] {{characters and}} a first-person narrator, signalling the literary style he would adopt in Brideshead Revisited {{a few years}} later. [...] Brideshead, which questions the meaning of human existence without God, is the first novel in which Evelyn Waugh clearly presents his conservative religious and political views. In the LIFE magazine article, [...] "Fan Fare" [...] (1946), Waugh said that [...] "you can only leave God out [...] by <b>making</b> <b>your</b> characters pure abstractions" [...] and that his future novels shall be [...] "the attempt to represent man more fully which, to me, means only one thing, man in his relation to God." [...] As such, the novel Helena (1950) is Evelyn Waugh's most philosophically Christian book.|$|E

[...] The consuls were also present during much of the torture.

500|$|The Annenbergs contributed {{substantially}} to Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign, {{and upon}} Reagan's election in 1981, Lee Annenberg was named as Chief of Protocol of the United States.

Annenberg oversaw a staff of 60 who worked on myriad details, ranging from {{the choice of the}} state gifts that will be given to the guest, to the bathrooms the foreign delegation may visit. She said of her position, [...] "It's all about <b>making</b> <b>your</b> guests feel respected and welcome". Annenberg attracted some controversy during her tenure when she curtsied before the visiting Prince Charles upon arriving for a diplomatic visit, commentators saying it was unseemly in a republic which gained its independence from the same monarchy.|$|E

Celeste Rhoads of AllMusic positively regarded Saxobeats and awarded {{it with a}} rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars. Similarly, German portal Mix1 gave it 7 stars out of 8.

500|$|The lyrics for Wasting Light were {{completed}} {{during the week}} each song was being recorded. Grohl said that the words were [...] "what was on my mind each week", most being [...] "written {{from the perspective of}} who I was then and who I am now", with references to the past, life and death, and [...] "time, but questioning whether it matters at all. There's so much focus on the before that people forget there's an after." [...] The frontman said this was helped by the environment - [...] "a lot of retrospection and introspection and nostalgia going back to the way we used to make records" [...] - and working with Vig again, which [...] "made me think a lot about starting over, and rebirth, and <b>making</b> <b>your</b> way through tragedy and coming out the other side." [...] An example was [...] "I Should Have Known", partially inspired by former Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain - [...] "a song like 'I Should Have Known' is about all the people I've lost, not just Kurt". Grohl still tried to do laid-back songs such as [...] "White Limo", which had its lyrics written in just two minutes, specially after Mendel sent him an e-mail saying, [...] "I really like it when you write songs that are silly and mean nothing, too. You don't have to try to write 'Imagine' every time you sit down with a pen and paper".|$|E
