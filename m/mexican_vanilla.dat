Its pods have fewer seeds than Vanilla planifolia, {{which is not a}} direct competitor. <b>Mexican</b> <b>vanilla</b> is used almost exclusively as the base of vanilla extract, due to higher vanillin levels. Tahitian vanilla is used primarily in perfume because of its coumarin-like scent. Other Tahitian vanilla products include vanilla green tea, vanilla oil, vanilla powder, vanilla rum, and vinegar-based vanilla.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mexican</b> <b>vanilla,</b> {{made from}} the native V. planifolia, is {{produced}} in much less quantity and marketed as the vanilla {{from the land of}} its origin. Vanilla sold in tourist markets around Mexico is sometimes not actual vanilla extract, but is mixed with an extract of the tonka bean, which contains the toxin coumarin. Tonka bean extract smells and tastes like vanilla, but coumarin has been shown to cause liver damage in lab animals and has been banned in food in the US by the Food and Drug Administration since 1954.|$|E
5000|$|There {{is about}} 3 {{calories}} per 1 gram of vanilla extract. It contains no fat, cholesterol and relatively low in protein. There {{are more than}} 150 kinds of vanilla plants growing around the world, but only two species are used commercially. The most common plant used and sold in most stores is called Bourbon or Madagascar vanilla extract. Pure <b>Mexican</b> <b>vanilla</b> extract can be available in specialty food stores. Bourbon, Madagascar and Mexican are made from the same species of beans, however they have different names and are grown in different areas.10 ...|$|E
2500|$|Vanilla is a {{flavoring}} {{derived from}} orchids {{of the genus}} Vanilla, primarily from the <b>Mexican</b> species, flat-leaved <b>vanilla</b> (V. planifolia). The word vanilla, derived from , the diminutive of the Spanish word [...] (vaina itself meaning sheath or pod), is translated simply as [...] "little pod". Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican people cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid, called tlilxochitl by the Aztecs. Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés is credited with introducing both vanilla and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s.|$|R
2500|$|True vanilla {{comes from}} a seed pod of an orchid called vanilla planifolia. This plant grows as a vine on host trees and is native to this area. The pods are green when harvested, and turn black when dried. In the Totonac language, vanilla is called Xanath and is {{used to make a}} liquor which is almost never seen outside of the Papantla area. These people have used vanilla for centuries as a flavoring, a perfume and as medicine. In the early colonial period, the Spanish quickly {{exported}} vanilla to Europe and a number of cultivators became wealthy. The name “vanilla” comes from the Spanish “vainilla” which means little seed pod. The growing of vanilla remained a monopoly of Mexico until hand pollination methods were developed that allowed the plant to grow {{in other parts of the}} world, devastating the industry here. Today, <b>Mexican</b> production of <b>vanilla</b> trails behind production in parts of Africa and Asia. [...] In spite of this, the Academy of Sciences and Gastronomic Arts in Paris in 1921chose to pay homage to the Totonacs who discovered vanilla.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mountain}} {{areas of the}} region are home to the vanilla plant, which {{is a kind of}} orchid which produces the bean from which the flavoring comes. [...] The bean was highly valued long before the arrival of the Spanish, used for religious rituals, perfumes and healing potions as well as a flavoring. When the Aztecs conquered Totonacapan, part of the tribute was in vanilla beans, mostly used to flavor chocolate drinks in Tenochtitlán. In the recent past, vanilla was a major trade in the region, with a number of vanilla “barons” {{in the first half of}} the 20th century making fortunes as middlemen and exporters. However, it began to be grown more cheaply elsewhere and the creation of synthetic vanilla collapsed the market for authentic <b>Mexican</b> <b>vanilla.</b> Despite the quality due to ideal growing conditions, Mexico produces only fifteen percent of the world’s vanilla. However, a number of entrepreneurs are working to bring the crop back experimenting with production rates and promoting the quality of Totonacapan-grown vanilla. The best vanilla still comes from here.The Tecolutla, Nautla and Vega de la Torre zones are fishing centers were cooperatives catch catfish, crayfish and other species although crayfish species are endangered.|$|E
