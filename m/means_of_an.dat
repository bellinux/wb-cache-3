40|$|Thesis (MSc (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Acute {{diarrhoea}} {{is one of}} {{the largest}} health challenges globally, causing millions of child deaths every year. A continued effort is made by the WHO, in collaboration with other institutions, to successfully combat diarrhoea. A new formulation for ORS (with a reduced osmolarity), in combination with zinc supplementation, was proposed to reduce the severity and duration of diarrhoea (WHO, 2006 : 1). Appropriate zinc supplementation for the treatment of diarrhoea includes: zinc sulfate, zinc acetate dihydrate and zinc gluconate. With no monographs available in The Ph. Int. for zinc acetate dihydrate and zinc gluconate APIs, the development thereof has become a priority to the WHO. During this study, suitable methods according to The Ph. Int. for the quality control testing of zinc acetate dihydrate and zinc gluconate APIs were investigated and proposed. The following monograph requirements were proposed for zinc acetate dihydrate API: * Identification <b>of</b> zinc by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> precipitation reaction <b>of</b> zinc hydroxide and zinc sulfide, * Identification <b>of</b> acetate by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> precipitation reaction <b>of</b> ferric acetate, * Clarity and colour <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 0. 05 g/ml solution, * pH value <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 0. 05 g/ml solution, * Assay by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> complexometric titration with disodium EDTA, * Impurities / Limit tests: o reducing substances by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reduction reaction with potassium permanganate, o chlorides by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> precipitation reaction with silver nitrate, o sulfates by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> precipitation reaction <b>of</b> barium sulfate, o arsenic by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> reaction between arsine and bromide, o aluminium, cadmium, copper, iron and lead by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> atomic absorption spectrometry. The following monograph requirements were proposed for zinc gluconate API: * Identification <b>of</b> zinc by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> precipitation reaction <b>of</b> zinc ferrocyanide, * Identification <b>of</b> gluconate by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> thin layer chromatographic separation method, * Clarity and colour <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 0. 01 g/ml solution, * pH value <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 0. 01 g/ml solution, * Water by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> the Karl Fischer method, * Assay by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> complexometric titration with disodium EDTA, * Impurities / Limit tests: o reducing sugars by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reduction reaction with cupri–tartaric test solution, o chlorides by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> precipitation reaction with silver nitrate, o sulfates by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> precipitation reaction <b>of</b> barium sulfate, o heavy metals by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> precipitation reaction <b>of</b> sulfides in acidic solutions, o cadmium by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> atomic absorption spectrometry, and o microbial testing if required by The Ph. Int. The proposed methods were then validated or verified according to international standards. Once the methods were proven to be fit for purpose, they were assembled into the respective monographs for inclusion in The Ph. Int. The newly developed monographs were then evaluated by determining the compliance of commercially available zinc acetate dihydrate and zinc gluconate to the proposed specifications. The study contributes to the WHO, pharmaceutical industry and medicines regulatory authorities by making these two monographs globally available, thus providing a quality gauge to ensure the availability of zinc acetate dihydrate and zinc gluconate APIs of pharmaceutical acceptable quality.

5|$|One of the {{principal}} sources of revenue Hamilton prevailed upon Congress to approve was an excise tax on whiskey.

5|$|One {{of these}} {{proposals}} was the Gemini Lunar Orbit Rescue Vehicle, {{which was designed}} to retrieve the crew of an Apollo spacecraft stranded in orbit around the Moon. It was to have used a stretched reentry module to accommodate the three astronauts who would have been aboard the Apollo. This would have been attached to a modified Equipment Module. The Equipment Module contained engines which would be used for Lunar orbit insertion and trans-Earth injection, as well as life support equipment to keep the crew alive until they returned to Earth. Launch and trans-Lunar injection would have been performed by a Saturn V. Once the spacecraft was in Lunar orbit, the Apollo crew would have boarded it by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> EVA.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} {{proposals}} {{to use the}} Gemini spacecraft to conduct long-duration missions to small, purpose-built space stations in low-Earth orbit.

A pressurized module between the Agena and the docking adapter would have been used by the crew for accommodation and to conduct experiments. The crew would have boarded the Agena by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inflatable tunnel between the hatches and its airlock. The Pecan spacecraft was a similar proposal.|$|E

5|$|Amundsen's initial plans {{had focused}} on the Arctic and the conquest of the North Pole by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{extended}} drift in an icebound ship. He obtained the use of Fridtjof Nansen's polar exploration ship Fram, and undertook extensive fundraising. Preparations for this expedition were disrupted when, in 1909, the rival American explorers Frederick Cook and Robert E. Peary each claimed to have reached the North Pole. Amundsen then changed his plan and began {{to prepare for a}} conquest of the South Pole; uncertain {{of the extent to which}} the public and his backers would support him, he kept this revised objective secret. When he set out in June1910, he led even his crew to believe they were embarking on an Arctic drift, and revealed their true Antarctic destination only when Fram was leaving their last port of call, Madeira.|$|E
5|$|Females vacate {{the nest}} after spawning, leaving the male behind {{to protect the}} eggs during the eight to ten days of incubation. A nest may contain 2,000 to 5,000 eggs, {{possibly}} more. Fecundity is usually related to size of the fish, so it isn't unusual for the roe of a large gravid female to contain over 55,000 eggs. Bowfin eggs are adhesive, and will attach to aquatic vegetation, roots, gravel, and sand. After hatching, larval bowfin do not swim actively in search of food. During the seven to nine days required for yolk-sac absorption, they attach to vegetation by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> adhesive organ on their snout, and remain protected by the parent male bowfin. Bowfin aggressively protect their spawn {{from the first day}} of incubation to a month or so after the eggs have hatched. When the fry are able to swim and forage on their own, they will form a school and leave the nest accompanied by the parent male bowfin who slowly circles them to prevent separation.|$|E
5|$|Making {{matters worse}} for the defenders, any {{aircraft}} that braved the weather and attempted to land was subject to North Vietnamese anti-aircraft fire on its way in for a landing. Once the aircraft touched down, it became the target of any number of NVA artillery or mortar crews. The aircrew then {{had to contend with}} anti-aircraft fire on the way out. As a result, 65 percent of all supplies were delivered by paradrops delivered by C-130 aircraft, mostly by the US Air Force, whose crews had significantly more experience in airdrop tactics than Marine air crews. The most dramatic supply delivery system used at Khe Sanh was the Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System (LAPES), in which palletized supplies were pulled out of the cargo bay of a low-flying transport aircraft by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> attached parachute. The pallet slid to a halt on the airstrip while the aircraft never had to actually land. The US Air Force delivered 14,356 tons of supplies to Khe Sanh by air (8,120 tons by paradrop). 1st Marine Aircraft Wing records claim that the unit delivered 4,661 tons of cargo into KSCB.|$|E

5|$|The Elementary Education Act 1880 {{insisted on}} {{compulsory}} attendance from 5–10 years. For poorer families, ensuring their children attended school proved difficult, {{as it was}} more tempting to send them working if the opportunity to earn an extra income was available. Attendance Officers often visited the homes of children who failed to attend school, which often proved to be ineffective. Children {{under the age of}} 13 who were employed were required to have a certificate to show they had reached the educational standard; employers of these children who weren't able to show this were penalised. An act brought into force thirteen years later went under the name of the Elementary Education (School Attendance) Act 1893, which stated a raised minimum leaving age to 11. Later the same year, the act was also extended for blind and deaf children, who previously had no <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> official education. This act was later amended in 1899 to raise the school leaving age up to 12 years of age.|$|E
5|$|The {{property}} that makes neurons unique is {{their ability to}} send signals to specific target cells over long distances. They send these signals by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> axon, which is a thin protoplasmic fiber that extends from the cell body and projects, usually with numerous branches, to other areas, sometimes nearby, sometimes in distant {{parts of the brain}} or body. The length of an axon can be extraordinary: for example, if a pyramidal cell, (an excitatory neuron) of the cerebral cortex were magnified so that its cell body became the size of a human body, its axon, equally magnified, would become a cable a few centimeters in diameter, extending more than a kilometer. These axons transmit signals in the form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials, which last less than a thousandth of a second and travel along the axon at speeds of 1–100 meters per second. Some neurons emit action potentials constantly, at rates of 10–100 per second, usually in irregular patterns; other neurons are quiet most of the time, but occasionally emit a burst of action potentials.|$|E
5|$|The studies {{looked at}} {{minimizing}} required {{modifications to the}} Gemini spacecraft. Three docking methods were considered. The first was use of the existing docking system used on Gemini-Agena missions. This would have allowed the mission to be accomplished with little modification to the Gemini spacecraft needed, however crew transfer {{could only have been}} accomplished by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Extra-vehicular activity (EVA). Changes that would have been required included strengthening the nose, installing two solid rockets to be used for a separation burn, adding the necessary equipment to perform the transfer EVA, and providing provisions for flight to and from the station. The number of retro-rockets would have been increased from four to six. A second method would have seen the spacecraft dock in the same way, but after docking, the spacecraft would be swung round and attached {{to the side of the}} space station. A tunnel would then have been placed over the Gemini's hatches, allowing the crew to transfer to the station without performing an EVA. Some modifications to the hatches would have been required. The final proposed docking method was to use a port mounted on the rear of the equipment module, which would have allowed the crew to transfer directly between the spacecraft and space station, through the docking port.|$|E
