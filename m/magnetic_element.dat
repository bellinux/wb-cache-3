The thermal portion of the circuit breaker provides a time response feature, that trips the circuit breaker sooner for larger overcurrents but allows smaller overloads to persist for a longer time. This allows short current spikes such as are produced when a motor or other non-resistive load is switched on.

40|$|We {{present the}} first center-to-limb G-band images {{synthesized}} from high resolution simulations of solar magneto-convection. Towards the limb the simulations show "hilly" granulation with dark bands {{on the far}} side, bright granulation walls and striated faculae, similar to observations. At disk center G-band bright points are flanked by dark lanes. The increased brightness in <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements</b> is due to their lower density compared with the surrounding intergranular medium. One thus sees deeper layers where the temperature is higher. At a given geometric height, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements</b> are cooler than the surrounding medium. In the G-band, the contrast is further increased by the destruction of CH in the low density <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements.</b> The optical depth unity surface is very corrugated. Bright granules have their continuum optical depth unity 80 km above the mean surface, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements</b> 200 - 300 km below. The horizontal temperature gradient is especially large next to flux concentrations. When viewed at an angle, the deep <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements</b> optical surface is hidden by the granules and the bright points are no longer visible, except where the "magnetic valleys" are aligned with the line of sight. Towards the limb, the low density in the strong <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements</b> causes unit line-of-sight optical depth to occur deeper in the granule walls behind than for rays not going through <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements</b> and variations in the field strength produce a striated appearance in the bright granule walls.

40|$|Context. The quiet Sun is an {{important}} part of understanding the global magnetic properties of the Sun. A recently launched observa-tion system, named HINODE, provides a lot of high-resolution images for studying the quiet Sun. Obviously, it is time-consuming to analyze these images by hand. It is desirable to develop a technique for recognizing <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements,</b> thus automatically computing magnetic properties and the relationship between <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements</b> and granulation. Aims. We design an automatic method of recognizing <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements</b> based on the features of HINODE magnetograms and of measuring their properties. Then we study the relationship between <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements</b> and granulation. Methods. We used the magnetogram, continuum image, and Dopplergram on April 16, 2007, which were taken with the Solar Optical Telescope instrument aboard HINODE. The field of view is 147. ′′ 60 × 162. ′′ 30 in a quiet solar region, locating at disk center. We intro-duced the mark-controlled watershed method to detect <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements</b> automatically, because it is a popular image-segmentation method for dealing with overlapping objects. We took the centers that are the local maximum in all directions as the marks for re-straining over-segmentation. We computed the properties of the detected <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements</b> and the relation among magnetic field strength, relative continuum intensity, and Doppler velocity at the same locations of <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements.</b> Results. We obtain the following results: (1) 34 % of our observation region are covered by magnetic fields; (2) the magnetic flux distribution of all elements reaches a peak at 1. 07 × 1016 Mx for the whole region; (3) the relative continuum intensity distribution a...|$|R

We present {{observational}} {{results that}} demonstrate a strong {{increase in the}} dynamic behavior of <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements</b> at the solar photosphere, when observed at high spatial and temporal resolution. The HAO/NSO Advanced Stokes Polarimeter was used to obtain an extensive set of high resolution Stokes-V spectra from network, intranetwork and active region magnetic fields at a low noise level. We performed a statistical analysis of Doppler shifts and asymmetries of the V spectra of FeI 630. 15 and 630. 25 nm to obtain information on the dynamics of <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements</b> of different sizes.

The quiet intranetwork regions are pervaded by horizontal <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements.</b> We categorize the horizontal intranetwork <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements</b> into two types: one is the non-isolated element which is accompanied by the vertical <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements</b> during its evolution; another is the isolated element which is not accompanied by the vertical <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements.</b> Their properties, such as lifetime, size and magnetic flux density, are studied, and the relationships among various magnetic parameters are investigated. We identify 446 horizontal intranetwork <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements,</b> among them 87 elements are isolated and 359 are non-isolated. Quantitative measurements reveal that the isolated elements have relatively weaker horizontal magnetic fields, almost equal size, and shorter lifetime comparing with the non-isolated elements. Most non-isolated horizontal intranetwork <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements</b> are identified to associate {{with the emergence of}} Ω-shaped flux loops. A few non-isolated elements seem to indicate scenarios of submergence of Ω loops or emergence of U-like loops. There is a positive correlation between the lifetime and the size for both the isolated and non-isolated HIFs. It is also found that there is also positive correlation between the lifetime and the magnetic flux density for non-isolated HIFs, but no correlation for isolated HIFs. Even though the horizontal <b>elements</b> show lower <b>magnetic</b> flux density, they could carry the total magnetic flux in the order of magnitude close to 10 25 Mx to the solar surface each day...|$|R

40|$|We {{simulate}} the dynamics {{and the evolution}} of quiet Sun <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements</b> to produce a probability density function of the field strengths associated with such elements. The dynamics of the magnetic field are simulated through a numerical model in which <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements</b> are passively driven by an advection field presenting spatio-temporal correlations which mimicks the granulation and the mesogranulation scales observed on the solar surface. The field strength can increase due to an amplification process which takes place where the <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements</b> converge. Starting from a delta-like probability density function centered on B= 30 G, we obtain magnetic field strengths up to 2 kG (in absolute value). To derive the statistical properties of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements</b> several simulation runs are performed. The model is able to produce kG magnetic fields in a time interval of the order of the granulation time scale. The mean unsigned flux density and the mean magnetic energy density of the synthetic quiet Sun reach respectively 100 G and 350 G in the stationary regime. The derived probability density function of the magnetic field strength decreases rapidly from B= 30 G to B= 100 G and presents a secondary maximum for B= 2 kG. From this result it follows that magnetic fields > 700 G dominate the unsigned flux density and magnetic energy density although the probability density function of the field strength presents a maximum for B= 30 G.

40|$|Aspects of the {{structure}} and dynamics of the flows in the Sun's surface shear layer remain uncertain and yet are critically important for understanding the observed magnetic behavior. In our previous studies of the axisymmetric transport of <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements</b> we found systematic changes in both the differential rotation and the meridional flow {{over the course of}} Solar Cycle 23. Here we examine how those flows depend upon the strength (and presumably anchoring depth) of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements.</b> Line of sight magnetograms obtained by the HMI instrument aboard SDO over the course of Carrington Rotation 2097 were mapped to heliographic coordinates and averaged over 12 minutes to remove the 5 -min oscillations.

In the present study, the interaction of two <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements</b> is considered. Our objectives are to study magnetic energy build up, storage and dissipation as a result of emergence, cancellation, and flyby of these <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements.</b> In the future these interactions will be the basic building blocks of more complicated simulations involving hundreds of elements. Each interaction is simulated in the presence of an overlying uniform magnetic field, which lies at various orientations with respect to the evolving <b>magnetic</b> <b>elements.</b> For these three small-scale interactions, the free energy stored in the field {{at the end of the}} simulation ranges from 0. 2 - 2. 1 × 10 ^ 26 ergs, while the total energy dissipated ranges from 1. 3 - 6. 3 × 10 ^ 26 ergs. For all cases, a stronger overlying field results in higher energy storage and dissipation. For the cancellation and emergence simulations, motion perpendicular to the overlying field results in the highest values. For the flyby simulations, motion parallel to the overlying field gives the highest values. In all cases, the free energy built up is sufficient to explain small-scale phenomena such as X-ray bright points or nanoflares.
