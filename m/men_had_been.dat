5|$|The Natchez {{lost only}} about 12 warriors during the attack. Eight warriors died attacking the {{homestead}} of the La Loire des Ursins family, where the <b>men</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> able {{to prepare a}} defense against the intruding Natchez.|$|E
5|$|By 1916, seventy-four {{men from}} Mells {{had left to}} fight, and several women, {{including}} Lady Horner, were working as nurses in France. By {{the end of the}} war, 21 <b>men</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> killed and multiple others wounded. Among the returned was the curate of St Andrew's Church, who earned the Military Cross for saving a wounded soldier.|$|E
60|$|They returned, in two hours, {{with the}} news that a party of ten <b>men</b> <b>had</b> arrived in the town, on the {{previous}} day, with two prisoners. One, a coloured <b>man,</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> able to walk. The other, a white <b>man,</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> carried in on a litter. They <b>had</b> both <b>been</b> lodged in the jail.|$|R

5|$|Having won the battle, Nelson {{needed to}} send despatches to his commander, Vice-Admiral Earl St. Vincent {{reporting}} on {{the destruction of the}} French Mediterranean fleet. These messages were entrusted to Captain Edward Berry, who had served as Nelson's flag captain on HMS Vanguard during the battle. Thompson was ordered to escort Berry to St. Vincent, believed to be with the blockade squadron off Cadiz, in Leander. Although Leander had not suffered serious damage in the battle, Thompson had manning problems: casualties from the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife in July 1797 had never been replaced, 14 <b>men</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> wounded in the battle at Aboukir Bay and two officers and fifty <b>men</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> detached to man the captured French prizes. This left Thompson with just 282 men on board Leander. Following Nelson's orders, Thompson sailed on 5 August.|$|E
5|$|The KRRC's 3rd Battalion, {{including}} {{a platoon of}} 70 Rhodesians, was transferred from France to the Salonika Front in 1915. On this comparatively quiet front, they were slowly whittled down {{over the course of}} the war: 26 of them remained in January 1917, and by the end of the war so few were left that the platoon no longer existed. Most of the <b>men</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> killed in action, while others were prisoners of the Bulgarians.|$|E
5|$|The Swedes {{had fought}} bravely. Salzback had {{personally}} dispatched 8 men. But their losses were heavy, over 2,000 <b>men</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> killed, {{almost half the}} force while the allies had lost 1,900 men. The defenses at Nyborg was in no condition to withstand a siege. There was nothing for the Swedish to do but to surrender, forcing 5,000 men into captivity; Sweden had suffered a devastating defeat.|$|E

40|$|Deslanting the Lens {{examines}} {{the historical and}} sociological implications of how Asian <b>men</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> represented in popular American film. From {{the early days of}} “yellowface” to caricatures like Long Duck Dong, Asian <b>men</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> relegated to perpetual foreigner status in American cinema. This paper will explore why the portrayal of Asian <b>men</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> limited to very specific ideas about Asian and Asian Americans are in society. This analysis will also include how socio/political events have shaped and influence popular perceptions about Asians, that inform how Asian men continue to be depicted in film...|$|R
5|$|The {{physical}} standards {{under which}} the first contingent of the AIF was recruited were very strict, nevertheless {{by the end of}} August over 20,000 <b>men</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> recruited into one infantry division—the 1st Division—and one light horse brigade, the 1st Light Horse Brigade. Following a brief period of training in Australia, the force set sail for the Middle East, assembling off Albany, Western Australia, in early November 1914 before leaving Australian waters, with the 2nd Battalion embarked upon the HMAT Suffolk.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they failed}} to achieve their objectives, by nightfall the ANZACs had formed a beachhead, albeit much smaller than intended. In places they were {{clinging}} onto cliff faces with no organised defence system. Their precarious position convinced both divisional commanders to ask for an evacuation, but after taking advice from the Royal Navy about how practicable that would be, the army commander decided they would stay. The exact number of the day's casualties is not known. The ANZACs had landed two divisions but over two thousand of their <b>men</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> killed or wounded, together {{with at least a}} similar number of Turkish casualties.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the war, Australia's economy had been quite small and {{dependent}} largely upon agriculture and the resources industries for export earnings, while most manufactured products were imported from overseas. Almost immediately uncertainty over the continuation of foreign trade led to a rise in unemployment, indeed it was estimated that after only a couple of days of Britain having declared war, that up to 15,000 <b>men</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> retrenched in New South Wales alone due to concerns about the continued availability of foreign markets for Australian produce.|$|E

25|$|In December 2005, Aaron Gillego, a {{columnist}} for The Advocate, criticized the series for having never cast an Asian man in the then-13 years of its existence, opining that Asian women <b>have</b> <b>been</b> cast on the show because heterosexual <b>men</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> socialized by the media {{to think of them}} as exotic beauties or sex objects, but that Asian <b>men</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> largely invisible in popular media. As of 2017, an Asian <b>man</b> <b>has</b> never <b>been</b> cast in the 25 years of the show's existence.|$|R

5|$|By {{this time}} {{most of the}} 3rd Brigade <b>men</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> killed or wounded, and the line was held by the five {{depleted}} companies from the 1st Brigade. On the left, Gordon's company 2nd Battalion, with the 11th and 12th Battalion's survivors, charged five times and captured the summit of Baby 700, but were driven back by Turkish counter-attacks; Gordon was among the casualties. For the second time Maclagen requested reinforcements for Baby 700, but the only reserves Bridges had available were two 2nd Battalion companies and the 4th Battalion. It was now 10:45 and the advance companies of the 1st New Zealand Brigade were disembarking, so it was decided {{they would go to}} Baby 700.|$|E
5|$|Lon Nol saw Cambodia's {{population}} of 400,000 ethnic Vietnamese as possible hostages to prevent PAVN attacks and ordered their roundup and internment. Cambodian soldiers and civilians then unleashed a reign of terror, murdering thousands of Vietnamese civilians. On 15 April for example, 800 Vietnamese <b>men</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> rounded {{up at the}} village of Churi Changwar, tied together, executed, and their bodies dumped into the Mekong River. They then floated downstream into South Vietnam. Cambodia's actions were denounced by both the North and South Vietnamese governments.|$|E
5|$|Munitions transported {{through the}} {{magazine}} included bombs, shells, naval mines, torpedoes, and small arms ammunition. The munitions, {{destined for the}} Pacific Theater of Operations, were delivered to the Port Chicago facility by rail then individually loaded by hand, crane and winch onto cargo ships for transport to the war zones. From the beginning, all the enlisted men employed as loaders at Port Chicago were African-American; all their commanding officers were white. All of the enlisted <b>men</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> specifically trained {{for one of the}} naval ratings during his stay at Naval Station Great Lakes (NSGL) but the men were instead put to work as stevedores. None of the new recruits had been instructed in ammunition loading.|$|E

5|$|On April 27, nine of {{the fallen}} militants were buried in Erec. Some 400 ethnic Albanians {{attended}} their funerals. The dead {{ranged in age from}} seventeen to forty-five years old. Villagers claimed that some of the dead had been arrested days before their deaths and thus could not have been ambushed, as the Yugoslav authorities claimed. Such claims could not be independently verified by Western reporters. In a 1998 report, Amnesty International affirmed that the 19 <b>men</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> killed in an ambush while trying to smuggle weapons into Kosovo.|$|E
5|$|The band's road manager, Brian Maguire {{stated that}} when he drove away from Banbridge in the lead, a few minutes ahead of the band's minibus, he passed through {{security}} barriers manned by the RUC. As Maguire continued ahead, up the by-pass towards Newry, he noticed a blue Triumph 2000 pulling-out from {{where it had been}} parked in a lay-by. Maguire recalled that the car first slowed down, then it accelerated, flashing its lights. Two <b>men</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> observed acting suspiciously inside the Castle Ballroom during the band's performance that night, suggesting that the Miami Showband's movements were being carefully monitored.|$|E
5|$|The seventh wave, {{made up of}} USS LST-67, LST-452, and LST-454, {{arrived at}} Scarlet Beach at midnight. As with the {{previous}} wave, each carried an Australian labour force which unloaded the LSTs {{under the direction of}} the Shore Battalion. The LSTs retracted at 03:00 in order to be well clear before dawn. During the first day, Australian casualties were 20 killed, 65 wounded, and nine missing, all of whom were eventually found to be either dead or wounded. The VII Amphibious Force reported that three <b>men</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> wounded.|$|E

5|$|The unit, {{initially}} {{known as}} the No.1 Long Range Patrol Unit (LRP), was founded on 3 July 1940. Bagnold wanted men who were energetic, innovative, self-reliant, physically and mentally tough, and able to live and fight in seclusion in the Libyan desert. Bagnold felt that New Zealand farmers would possess these attributes and was given permission to approach the 2nd New Zealand Division for volunteers; over half the division volunteered. Two officers and 85 other ranks including 18 administrative and technical personnel were eventually selected, coming mostly from the Divisional Cavalry Regiment and the 27th Machine-Gun Battalion. Once the <b>men</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> recruited, they started training in desert survival techniques and desert driving and navigation, with additional training in radio communications and demolitions.|$|E
5|$|A Greek fleet {{under the}} Spartan king Leotychides had sailed to Samos to {{challenge}} {{the remnants of the}} Persian fleet. The Persians, whose ships were in a poor state of repair, had decided not to risk fighting and instead drew their ships up on the beach at the feet of Mount Mycale in Ionia. An army of 60,000 <b>men</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> left there by Xerxes and the fleet joined with them, building a palisade around the camp to protect the ships. However, Leotychides decided to attack the camp with the Allied fleet's marines. Seeing the small size of the Greek force, the Persians emerged from the camp but the Greek hoplites again proved superior and destroyed much of the Persian force. The ships were abandoned to the Greeks, who burned them, crippling Xerxes' sea power and marking the ascendancy of the Greek fleet.|$|E
5|$|Bleak then {{returned}} to the patrol and attempted to treat more wounded members, but soon thereafter a Chinese hand grenade bounced off the helmet of the soldier standing next to him and landed nearby. Bleak tackled the soldier over and covered him with his larger frame to protect him from the grenade, but neither was injured in the ensuing blast. The patrol then continued on its mission, and was successful in capturing several Chinese prisoners. However, as it descended Hill 499 to return to UN lines, they were ambushed by another group of Chinese hidden in a trench with an automatic weapon. Three of the other soldiers were wounded in the attack, and as Bleak attempted to run to them, he was hit in the leg. Bleak dressed all four wounds, but one of the <b>men</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> hit too critically to move. In spite of continued Chinese fire and his own injury, Bleak picked up the wounded soldier and began to carry him down the hill.|$|E
