5|$|The {{types of}} {{minerals}} present in volcanic ash {{are dependent on}} the chemistry of the magma from which it erupted. Considering that the most abundant elements found in silicate magma are silicon and oxygen, {{the various types of}} magma (and therefore ash) produced during volcanic eruptions are most commonly explained in terms of their silica content. Low energy eruptions of basalt produce a characteristically dark coloured ash containing ~45 - 55% silica that is generally rich in iron (Fe) and <b>magnesium</b> (<b>Mg).</b> The most explosive rhyolite eruptions produce a felsic ash that is high in silica (>69%) while other types of ash with an intermediate composition (e.g., andesite or dacite) have a silica content between 55-69%.|$|E
5|$|Seawater is {{invariably}} salty and, {{although its}} degree of saltiness (salinity) can vary, about 90% {{of the water}} in the ocean has 34– (1.2 oz.) of dissolved solids per liter, producing a salinity between 3.4 and 3.5%. To easily describe small differences, however, oceanographers usually express salinity as a millage (‰) or part per thousand (ppt) instead of using percents. The surface salinity of waters in the Northern Hemisphere are generally closer to the 34‰ mark, while those in the South are closer to 35‰. The solutes in ocean water come both from inflowing river water and from the ocean floor. The relative composition of the solutes is stable throughout the world's oceans: sodium (Na) and chloride (Cl) make up about 85%. Other solutes include metal ions such as <b>magnesium</b> (<b>Mg)</b> and calcium (Ca) and negative ions such as sulfate (SO₄), carbonate (CO₃), and bromides. In the absence of other pollution, seawater would not be harmful to drink except that it is much too saline; similarly, it cannot be used for irrigating most plants without being desalinated. For scientific and technical purposes, a standardized form of artificial seawater is often used.|$|E
25|$|Elements {{known to}} be present on the lunar surface include, among others, oxygen (O), silicon (Si), iron (Fe), <b>magnesium</b> (<b>Mg),</b> calcium (Ca), {{aluminium}} (Al), manganese (Mn) and titanium (Ti). Among the more abundant are oxygen, iron and silicon. The oxygen content is estimated at 45% (by weight). Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) appear to be present only in trace quantities from deposition by solar wind.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{temperatures}} on the illuminated side of the planet, and the likelihood that all surface volatiles have been depleted, silicate rock vaporization may have produced a tenuous atmosphere (with a pressure approaching 1 Pa or 10−2 mbar at 2500 K) consisting predominantly of sodium, O2, O and silicon monoxide, as well as smaller amounts of potassium and other metals. <b>Magnesium</b> (<b>Mg),</b> aluminium (Al), calcium (Ca), silicon (Si), and iron (Fe) may rain out from such an atmosphere on the planet's daylight side {{in the form of}} particles of minerals, such as enstatite, corundum and spinel, wollastonite, silica, and iron (II) oxide, that would condense at altitudes below 10km. Titanium (Ti) may be depleted (and possibly iron similarly) by being transported towards the night side before condensing as perovskite and geikelite. Sodium (and to a lesser extent, potassium), being more volatile, would be less subject to condensation into clouds, and would dominate the outer layers of the atmosphere. Observations carried out with the UVES spectrograph on COROT-7b in and out of transit, searching for emission and absorption lines originating in the exosphere of the planet, failed to detect any significative feature. Spectral lines of calcium (Ca I, Ca II) and sodium (Na), expected for a Mercury-like planet, are either absent or below detection limits, and even emission lines expected from volcanic activity, due to tidal forces exerted by the gravity of the nearby star, were not found. The lack of detections is in agreement with the previously cited theoretical work, which points to a cloudless atmosphere made of rocky vapours with a very low pressure. From the data available, scientists can only infer that COROT-7b does not resemble any of the rocky planets of the Solar System.|$|E

30|$|Metal nitride {{coatings}} are extensively {{employed in}} various scientific and industrial applications, {{because of their}} remarkable properties [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Among metal nitrides, <b>magnesium</b> nitride films (<b>Mg</b> 3 N 2) are of particular interest and have wide range of applications, {{which can be used}} for preparation of high hardness, high thermal conductivity, corrosion resistance, abrasion resistance and high temperature of the other elements of the nitrides, preparation of special ceramic materials, manufacture of special alloy blowing agents, manufacture of special glass, catalytic polymer cross-linking, nuclear waste recycling and synthesis of diamond and cubic boron nitride as catalyst material [6, 7]. Also, <b>magnesium</b> nitride (<b>Mg</b> 3 N 2) is a hexagonal inorganic compound of magnesium and nitrogen and a greenish yellow powder at room temperature and pressure which is used as an additive for high-strength steel melting, alternative in construction of steel for melting magnesium desulfurization, favorable increase of the density of steel, strength, tension and endurance, increase of the internal material “alum” (Vitriol) content for quality of construction of steel. Therefore, using of <b>magnesium</b> nitride (<b>Mg</b> 3 N 2) can reduce the amount of other additives, which help to reduce the production cost in construction of steel [6, 7]. Different properties of grown thin films depend directly on the microstructure of the thin film, which can vary for different deposition methods and deposition parameters, namely, deposition rate, substrate temperature, ratio of ions to neutral atoms and the amount of contamination. Therefore, thin films can be grown with different nano-structures, crystallographic orientations and chemical compositions [8, 9, 10, 11].|$|R
