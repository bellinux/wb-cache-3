40|$|Judicious media {{planning}} decisions are crucial for successful advertising of products. Media planners extensively use mathematical models supplemented with market research and expert opinion to devise the media plans. <b>Media</b> <b>planning</b> <b>models</b> {{discussed in the}} literature largely focus on single products with limited studies related to the multi-product {{media planning}}. In this {{paper we propose a}} media planning model to allocate limited advertising budget among multiple products advertised in a segmented market and determine the number of advertisements to be given in different media. The proposed model is formulated considering both segment specific and mass media vehicles to maximize the total advertising reach for each product. The model also incorporates the cross product effect of advertising of one product on the other. The proposed formulation is a multi-objective linear integer programming model and interactive linear integer goal programming is discussed to solve the model. A real life case study is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed model...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{a model to}} {{estimate}} {{the probability that a}} target group of an advertising campaign is reached by a commercial message a given number of times. This contact frequency distribution is known to be computationally difficult to calculate because of dependence between the viewing probabilities of advertisements. Our model calculates good estimates of contact frequencies {{in a very short time}} based on data that is often available. A media planning model that optimizes effective reach as a function of contact frequencies demonstrates the usefulness of the model. Several local search procedures such as taboo search, simulated annealing and genetic algorithms are applied to find a good media schedule. The results show that local search methods are flexible, fast and accurate in finding media schedules for <b>media</b> <b>planning</b> <b>models</b> based on contact frequencies. The contact frequency model is a potentially useful new tool for media planners. optimization;contact frequency;effective reach;media planning...|$|E
40|$|This {{review is}} {{intended}} to provide an overview and assessment of work conducted largely in the academic community on advertising media decision models in {{the past thirty years}} or so. The area of media decision models in advertising will be considered in this review from two standpoints: (1) Those models which aim at estimation of the numbers of people in target markets exposed to the media schedule (reach and frequency of exposure distribution models); and (2) those models which often incorporate exposure distribution models as their fundamental building block and aim at the complete planning and scheduling of the media program (comprehensive <b>media</b> <b>planning</b> <b>models).</b> I. Reach and Frequency Media Models The issue which has come to serve as the focus of those in the United States, as well as other countries interested in exposure distribution models has its origins in the need of advertising practitioners to know how many people will be exposed to their advertisements.

40|$|Of {{the various}} media {{vehicles}} available for advertising, {{the internet is}} the latest and the most rapidly growing, emerging as the ideal medium to promote products and services in the global market. In this article, the authors propose an internet <b>media</b> <b>planning</b> <b>model</b> whose main objective is to help advertisers determine the return they obtain from spending on internet advertising. Using available data such as internet page view and advertising performance data, the model contributes to attempts not only to optimize the internet advertising schedule but also to fix the right price for internet advertisements {{on the basis of}} the characteristics of the exposure distribution of sites. The authors test the model with data provided by KoreanClick, a Korean market research company that specializes in internet audience measurement. The optimal durations for the subject sites provide some useful insights. The findings contrast with current web <b>media</b> <b>planning</b> practices, and the authors demonstrate the potential savings that could be achieved if their approach were applied. media planning; optimization; advertising repeat exposure; probability distribution; internet...|$|R

From de advertising <b>media</b> <b>planning,</b> new <b>media</b> give new ways to reach the consumers, but they also add more complexity. The communication capacity of online media and the greater use of that media by part of the users open up {{the debate about the}} necessity of rethinking the approach of the ‘traditional’ advertising <b>media</b> <b>planning,</b> which structure and work processes were developed when media were offline. So, this article gives a panoramic view about the influence of new media in advertising <b>media</b> <b>planning.</b> To do this, in first place, describes the current scenario, analyzing the penetration and advertising expenditure in Internet.
