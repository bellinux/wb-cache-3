5|$|A {{contemporary}} account {{said that}} King Charles in person worked <b>manually,</b> that day or later, to help throw water on flames {{and to help}} demolish buildings to make a firebreak.|$|E
5|$|A {{rammed earth}} wall is built by placing damp soil in a {{temporary}} form. The soil is <b>manually</b> or mechanically compacted {{and then the}} form is removed.|$|E
5|$|Backwards-incompatible versions, where code is {{expected}} to break and must be <b>manually</b> ported. The {{first part of the}} version number is incremented. These releases happen infrequently—for example, version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0.|$|E
5|$|Each {{bulkhead}} {{could be}} sealed by watertight doors. The engine rooms and boiler {{rooms on the}} tank top deck had vertically closing doors that could be controlled remotely from the bridge, lowered automatically by a float if water was present, or closed <b>manually</b> by the crew. These took about 30 seconds to close; warning bells and alternate escape routes were provided so that the crew would not be trapped by the doors. Above the tank top level, on the Orlop Deck, F Deck and E Deck, the doors closed horizontally and were <b>manually</b> operated. They could be closed at the door itself or from the deck above.|$|E
5|$|Homemade {{versions}} of pancake machines have been constructed. An {{example of a}} homemade pancake machine is one constructed in 1977 by Ken Whitsett of the Ocala Kiwanis Club in Ocala, Florida, which {{was used for the}} organization's annual pancake day. The Kiwanis machine utilized a hopper filled with pancake batter that was <b>manually</b> dropped onto a revolving griddle. The pancakes were <b>manually</b> flipped and plated when cooking was completed. It required four people for its operation, and could produce between 750–1000 pancakes per hour.|$|E
5|$|The {{radiation}} sources {{used for}} brachytherapy are always enclosed within a non-radioactive capsule. The sources {{can be delivered}} <b>manually,</b> but are more commonly delivered through a technique known as ‘afterloading’.|$|E
5|$|These {{limitations}} {{have caused}} problems. For example, before 2005, DST in Israel varied {{each year and}} was skipped some years. Windows 95 used rules correct for 1995 only, causing problems in later years. In Windows 98, Microsoft marked Israel as not having DST, forcing Israeli users to shift their computer clocks <b>manually</b> twice a year. The 2005 Israeli Daylight Saving Law established predictable rules using the Jewish calendar but Windows zone files could not represent the rules' dates in a year-independent way. Partial workarounds, which mishandled older time stamps, included <b>manually</b> switching zone files every year and a Microsoft tool that switches zones automatically. In 2013, Israel standardized its daylight saving time according to the Gregorian calendar.|$|E
5|$|A Sm3 derailed near Karjaa on 25 July 2003 due to {{a defect}} in a turnout. The train derailed at a low speed after {{mechanics}} turned the turnout blades <b>manually</b> into the correct position, but forgot to check the turnout frog, which was set to a diverging track. The first three carriages of the train derailed completely, {{in addition to the}} first bogie of the fourth car.|$|E
5|$|A gritter, {{also known}} as a sander, salt {{spreader}} or salt truck, is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so commonly seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously. Gritters are used to spread grit (rock salt), onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, with a wire mesh over the top to prevent foreign objects from entering the spreading mechanism and hence becoming jammed. The salt is generally spread across the roadway by an impeller, attached by a hydraulic drive system to a small onboard engine. However, until the 1970s, the grit was often spread <b>manually</b> using shovels by men riding {{on the back of the}} truck, and some older spreading mechanisms still require grit be <b>manually</b> loaded into the impeller from the hopper.|$|E
5|$|Burr {{was quickly}} called to Canada's Naval Services Headquarters {{to discuss how}} to apply {{diffused}} lighting camouflage. Simple tests in the laboratory served as proof of concept. In January 1941, sea trials began on the new corvette HMCS Cobalt. She was fitted with ordinary light projectors—neither designed for robustness, nor waterproofed—on temporary supports {{on one side of}} the hull; brightness was controlled <b>manually.</b> The trial was sufficiently promising for a better prototype to be developed.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{significant}} noise reduction typical of vehicles traveling in all-electric mode at low speeds, the Volt is {{fitted with a}} <b>manually</b> activated electronic warning sound system called Pedestrian-Friendly Alert System for use when the car is operating at low speeds to alert pedestrians to the car's presence.|$|E
5|$|During normal {{passenger}} {{operation on}} revenue tracks, trains {{are designed to}} be controlled by an integrated Automatic Train Operation (ATO) and Automatic Train Control (ATC) system that accelerates and brakes trains automatically without operator intervention. All trains are still manned with train operators who open and close the doors, make station announcements, and supervise their trains. The system was designed so that an operator could <b>manually</b> operate a train when necessary.|$|E
5|$|Filler metals {{are also}} used in nearly all {{applications}} of GTAW, the major exception being the welding of thin materials. Filler metals are available with different diameters and are made {{of a variety of}} materials. In most cases, the filler metal {{in the form of a}} rod is added to the weld pool <b>manually,</b> but some applications call for an automatically fed filler metal, which often is stored on spools or coils.|$|E
5|$|General Motors' first commercially {{available}} plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, the Chevrolet Volt, introduced in December 2010, includes warning sounds for pedestrians. GM's system is called Pedestrian-Friendly Alert System {{and it is}} <b>manually</b> activated by the driver, but future generations probably will include an active system.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{up through}} 2012, Valve would <b>manually</b> select games to be {{included}} on the Steam service, generally limiting these to games that either had a major developer supporting them, or smaller studios with proven track records for Valve's purposes. Valve have sought ways to enable more games to be offered through Steam, while pulling away from <b>manually</b> approving games for the service, short of validating that a game runs on the platforms the publisher had indicated. Alden Kroll, {{a member of the}} Steam development team, said that Valve knows Steam is in a near-monopoly for game sales on personal computers, and the company {{does not want to be}} in a position to determine what gets sold, and thus had tried to find ways to make the process of adding games to Steam outside of their control. At the same time, Valve recognized that unfettered control of games onto the service can lead to discovery problems as well as low-quality games that are put onto the service for a cash grab.|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{oligonucleotide}} synthesis {{was carried}} out <b>manually</b> in solution or on solid phase. The solid phase synthesis was implemented using, as containers for the solid phase, miniature glass columns similar in their shape to low-pressure chromatography columns or syringes equipped with porous filters.|$|E
5|$|It {{was first}} thought that Fossett {{may have also}} been wearing a Breitling Emergency watch with a <b>manually</b> {{operated}} ELT that had a range of up to , but no signal was received from it. On September 13, Fossett's wife, Peggy, issued a statement clarifying that he owned such a watch but was not wearing it when he took off for the Labor Day flight.|$|E
5|$|Later that year, Rindt drove, {{again in}} a Ferrari 250LM, at the 500 {{kilometre}} race at Zeltweg. He was able to win ahead of the better powered Ferrari of Mike Parkes owing to a special lever that <b>manually</b> activated the brake lights. Using the tool shortly before his actual braking point, Rindt was able to force Parkes to brake earlier than him which allowed him to stay ahead.|$|E
5|$|Secondary {{armament}} included eighteen 15cm (5.9inch) SK L/40 guns; {{six were}} emplaced in single turrets amidships and twelve were mounted in MPL casemates. These guns fired armor-piercing shells {{at a rate}} of 4–5 per minute. The ships carried 120 shells per gun, for a total of 2,160 rounds total. The guns could depress to −7degrees and elevate to 20degrees, for a maximum range of 13,700m (14,990yd). They were <b>manually</b> elevated and trained.|$|E
5|$|Square {{accumulated}} four SGI Origin 2000 series servers, four Onyx2 systems, and 167 Octane workstations for the film's production. The basic {{film was}} rendered at a custom render farm created by Square in Hawaii. It housed 960 Pentium III-933MHz workstations. Character movements were filmed using motion capture technology. Animator Matthew Hackett stated that while motion capture was effective {{for many of}} the scenes, in others animators still had to add movements <b>manually.</b> Hand and facial movements were all done <b>manually.</b> Some of General Hein's facial features and poses were based on Hackett. As animators did not want to use any actual photographs in the film, all backgrounds were done using matte paintings. 1,327 scenes in total needed to be filmed to animate the digital characters. The film consists of 141,964 frames, with each frame taking an average of 90 minutes to render. By the end of production Square had a total of 15 terabytes of artwork for the film. It is estimated that over the film's four-year production, approximately 200 people put in a combined 120 years of work on it.|$|E
5|$|The Chew Magna {{telephone}} exchange was <b>manually</b> operated until the 1950s. An important number Chew Magna 2 {{was that of}} Dr Terrell Hughes: the exchange operators could often locate him in an emergency {{even if he was}} away from his home and surgery. The manual exchange served most of the Chew valley and even East Dundry.|$|E
5|$|The Debian project offers {{documentation}} and tools to harden a Debian installation both <b>manually</b> and automatically. Security-Enhanced Linux and AppArmor support is available but disabled by default. Debian provides an optional hardening wrapper, {{and does not}} harden all of its software by default using gcc features such as PIE and buffer overflow protection, unlike operating systems such as OpenBSD, but tries to build as many packages as possible with hardening flags.|$|E
5|$|The Great Hall {{which has}} a double {{staircase}} still contains an original pipe organ built by Flight and Robson of London. In addition to being played <b>manually,</b> it could originally be set to play the overture and a duet ("Ah, Perdona") from Mozart's Clemenza di Tito.|$|E
5|$|The Parallax Correctors {{were needed}} because the turrets were located {{hundreds}} of feet from the director. There was one for each turret, and each had the turret/director distance <b>manually</b> set in. They automatically received Relative Target Bearing (bearing from own ship's bow), and Target Range. They corrected the bearing order for each turret so that all rounds fired in a salvo converged on the same point.|$|E
5|$|The action {{could not}} be opened until a slight forward {{movement}} of the slide handle released the action slide lock. In firing, the recoil of the shotgun gave a slight forward motion to the slide handle and released the action slide lock which enabled immediate opening of the action. In {{the absence of any}} recoil, the slide handle had to be pushed forward <b>manually</b> in order to release the action slide lock.|$|E
5|$|The first {{automatic}} power {{windows were}} developed by Packard in 1940. Each of the major American brands experimented with the technology, which was initially for luxury vehicles {{as a replacement for}} <b>manually</b> operated roll up windows. In the 1950s, these became widespread in American passenger cars.|$|E
5|$|The {{line had}} no signals or {{automatic}} points {{to control the}} switching between lines at junctions with the main line and with the sidings. On the approach to a level crossing the fireman ran ahead with a red flag, to stop the traffic; he also <b>manually</b> operated the points.|$|E
5|$|The {{model of}} the drone was created by Dan Curry, from a L'eggs pantyhose {{container}} and a shampoo bottle. He hand animated the model instead of using motion control photography, using his years of Tai Chi training to keep the movements fluid. In order to blend into the background, he wore a pair of green tights whilst he was <b>manually</b> moving the model on screen.|$|E
5|$|The ship's crew {{comprised}} 50 {{officers and}} 656 ratings in 1863. The {{majority of the}} crew had to do physically demanding tasks; one such duty was the raising of the heaviest <b>manually</b> hauled anchors in maritime history. The day-to-day life of her crew differed little from those on the navy's traditional wooden-hulled vessels.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{also carried}} twelve 8.8cm (3.45in) SK L/30 quick-firing guns, also mounted in casemates. These guns were {{supplied}} with between 170 and 250 shells per gun. These guns fired 13.8kg (30.4lb) at a muzzle velocity of 590m/s (1,936ft/s). Their {{rate of fire}} was approximately 15 shells per minute; the guns could engage targets out to 10,500m (11,480yd). The gun mounts were <b>manually</b> operated. The ships' gun armament was rounded out by twelve machine guns.|$|E
5|$|Vavilovian mimicry {{is found}} in weeds that come to share {{characteristics}} with a domesticated plant through artificial selection. It is named after Russian botanist and geneticist Nikolai Vavilov. Selection against the weed may occur either by <b>manually</b> killing the weed, or by separating its seeds {{from those of the}} crop by winnowing.|$|E
5|$|Weapons are {{equipped}} on both {{hands of the}} characters and are used with the circle and cross buttons. Pressing both buttons in succession is necessary to execute combos. The other buttons are used to lock focus onto an enemy, guard, dash, or <b>manually</b> change the camera angle. The number of attacks and blocks is limited by an energy meter for each arm, which decreases after each move but replenishes with time.|$|E
5|$|When {{the trigger}} was pulled, the spring pushed {{the firing pin}} {{forwards}} into the bomb, which ignited the propellant in the bomb and launched {{it out of the}} trough and into the air. The recoil caused by the detonation of the propellant then blew the firing pin backwards onto the spring; this automatically cocked the weapon for subsequent shots, eliminating the need to <b>manually</b> re-cock.|$|E
5|$|A second {{overhaul}} of AA defense was made between 1944 and 1945, as the Navy had found 20mm shells too light to stop Japanese kamikaze planes; this plus the higher approach speeds of these planes made these <b>manually</b> controlled guns obsolete. In their place, more quad 40mm Bofors mounts were fitted. Maryland eventually carried forty quad 40mm and eighteen 20mm guns. Colorados quad 40s were increased to forty {{but she kept}} all her 20mm guns. West Virginia carried forty quad 40mm and fifty 20mm. guns.|$|E
5|$|By World War I, all of {{the major}} powers were experimenting with {{aircraft}} mounted cannon; however their low rate of fire and great size and weight precluded any of them from being anything other than experimental. The most successful (or least unsuccessful) was the SPAD 12 Ca.1 with a single 37mm Puteaux mounted to fire between the cylinder banks and through the propeller boss of the aircraft's Hispano-Suiza 8C. The pilot (by necessity an ace) had to <b>manually</b> reload each round.|$|E
5|$|High-tech {{systems may}} be {{dedicated}} devices developed solely for AAC, or non-dedicated {{devices such as}} computers that run additional software {{to allow them to}} function as AAC devices. They may be static or dynamic in form. Static communication devices have symbols in fixed positions on paper overlays, which are changed <b>manually.</b> To increase the vocabulary available, some static devices have multiple levels, with different words appearing on different levels. On dynamic AAC devices, the user can change the symbols available using page links to navigate to appropriate pages of vocabulary and messages.|$|E
