5|$|Although Spec Ops: The Line has {{a strong}} single-player focus, it also {{features}} <b>multiplayer</b> components. Yager was only responsible for the single-player campaign; the <b>multiplayer</b> was outsourced to Darkside Game Studios. The <b>multiplayer</b> team at 2K Games, which previously developed the <b>multiplayer</b> of BioShock 2, also assisted in creating the <b>multiplayer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Deus Ex was {{designed}} as a single player game, and the initial releases of the Windows and Macintosh versions of the game did not include <b>multiplayer</b> functionality. Support for <b>multiplayer</b> modes was later incorporated through patches. The component includes three game modes: deathmatch, basic team deathmatch, and advanced team deathmatch. Only five maps, based on levels from the single-player portion of the game, were included with the original <b>multiplayer</b> patch, but many user-created maps now exist. The PlayStation 2 release of Deus Ex does not offer a <b>multiplayer</b> mode. In April 2014 it was announced that Gamespy would cease their masterserver services, also affecting Deus Ex. A community-made patch for the <b>multiplayer</b> mode has been created as a response to this.|$|E
5|$|Dungeon Siege {{has both}} a single-player and <b>multiplayer</b> mode. The single-player mode {{consists}} of a single story and world; players can either create a new character when starting the story or use one created in a prior playthrough. The cooperative <b>multiplayer</b> mode allows for up to eight players to play through either the single-player storyline or in the <b>multiplayer</b> map, which features a central town hub with increasingly difficult enemies as players move away from it. <b>Multiplayer</b> games can be set to different difficulty levels, allowing accommodation of higher-leveled characters. Additional maps can be created by players that can allow for competitive <b>multiplayer</b> instead. <b>Multiplayer</b> matches can be created and joined via local area networks, direct IP addresses, and, prior to its closure in 2006, through the Microsoft Zone matchmaking service.|$|E
5|$|From the outset, {{the team}} {{wanted to make}} a grand RPG, but were {{restricted}} by their budget and schedule. They were reluctant to cut any content such as one of the time periods or the <b>multiplayer</b> aspect, and they decided to postpone the original release date from March 2000 to June the same year. They also scaled back the scope of their <b>multiplayer</b> testing and canceled the planned release of an interactive pre-launch demo. The delay allowed Nihilistic to retain most of the intended design but they were forced to remove the ability to play the entire single-player campaign as a team online, compensating for this by adding two <b>multiplayer</b> scenarios built using levels from the single-player game. Huebner said they did not plan appropriately for <b>multiplayer</b> when building the Java scripts for the single-player game, meaning the scripts did not work effectively in <b>multiplayer</b> mode.|$|E
5|$|GameSpot {{stated that}} the <b>multiplayer</b> {{functionality}} of Rise of Nations: Thrones and Patriots had some lag, even when on a local network. 1UP.com reported problems with crashes in both the single and <b>multiplayer</b> modes of Thrones and Patriots.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>multiplayer</b> matchmaking, ODST {{includes}} Halo 3s <b>multiplayer</b> game modes contained on {{a separate}} disc. The offering contains 21multiplayer maps released for Halo 3 as well as 3additional maps titled Citadel, Heretic, and Longshore. Along with the Halo 3 maps, ODST includes {{a version of the}} Forge map editor—a utility that allows player customizations of <b>multiplayer</b> levels.|$|E
5|$|Like Halo: Combat Evolved, the Xbox {{version of}} Halo 2 {{features}} a <b>multiplayer</b> {{system that allows}} players to {{compete with each other}} in split-screen and system link modes; in addition, it adds support for online <b>multiplayer</b> via Xbox Live.|$|E
5|$|Modem Wars, {{released}} in 1988 for DOS and the Commodore 64, {{was the first}} RTS with <b>multiplayer</b> games by means of modems. Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, which allow two gamers to compete by modem or local networks, persuaded a wider audience that <b>multiplayer</b> competition was much more challenging than contests against the artificial intelligence (AI), and made <b>multiplayer</b> facilities essential for future RTS titles.|$|E
5|$|<b>Multiplayer</b> {{comes in}} two forms in Empire: Total War. As with {{previous}} Total War titles, players {{can engage in}} real-time battles against each other either by composing their armies themselves, or re-enacting battles from history. The full campaign <b>multiplayer</b> mode was unveiled {{one month after the}} initial release, because the technology to create a <b>multiplayer</b> campaign game was not available in previous Total War games, and the time allowed The Creative Assembly to implement this for Empire: Total War. The campaign <b>multiplayer</b> mode was first tested in a two-player beta build which was released on 7 December 2009.|$|E
5|$|<b>Multiplayer</b> {{with up to}} {{four players}} is {{supported}} via a modem or over a local area network (LAN). The game features twenty <b>multiplayer</b> levels, playable as single-player levels.|$|E
5|$|Online <b>multiplayer</b> {{is set up}} {{similarly}} to local <b>multiplayer</b> but allows the players to be at separate computers. Additionally, hotseat can be combined with online play, so multiple human players can use each computer.|$|E
5|$|Players {{can play}} minigames in <b>multiplayer</b> mode at Tingle's Tower, which appears in every world, to gain extra <b>multiplayer</b> lives. These eight games are earned by playing though certain stages in <b>multiplayer</b> mode. The minigames include horse racing, hammer tag, monster hunting and five others.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{version of}} Dirge of Cerberus {{included}} a <b>multiplayer</b> mode absent from other releases, which contained music tracks {{not used in}} the single-player game. Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII <b>Multiplayer</b> Mode Original Sound Collections is a download-only soundtrack album for the <b>multiplayer</b> tracks released through the Japanese iTunes Store and the Square Enix Music Download website on August 22, 2006. It spans 1:07:07 over 27 tracks. The soundtrack includes all the music from the <b>multiplayer</b> mode and some music from the single-player game which did not appear on the previous soundtrack album, including two tracks composed by Ryo Yamazaki for the North American release of the game.|$|E
5|$|The Xbox Live <b>multiplayer</b> and {{downloadable}} content {{features of}} the Xbox version of Halo 2 were supported until the discontinuation of the service in April 2010. The online <b>multiplayer</b> of Halo 2 for Windows Vista uses Games for Windows – Live. In January 2013, {{it was reported that}} the PC <b>multiplayer</b> servers would be taken offline on February 15, 2013, due to inactivity. On February 12, 2013, it was announced that the <b>multiplayer</b> servers for Halo 2 on PC would remain online until June, while further support options would be investigated. The last original Xbox Live game session in Halo 2 concluded on May 10, 2010, almost a month after the service was officially terminated.|$|E
5|$|The {{addition}} of a <b>multiplayer</b> mode to Jedi Knight was met positively, but questions arose to why {{there are so few}} <b>multiplayer</b> maps and why single-player maps cannot be used in the <b>multiplayer</b> mode. Tom Chick of IGN believes this was corrected with the release of Mysteries of the Sith.|$|E
5|$|The game's <b>multiplayer</b> {{received}} mixed reviews. Prell {{thought that}} the mission-design was varied, and the voting system kept the mode from being repetitive. He also praised the interconnected structure between the single-player and <b>multiplayer,</b> noting that the items that could be carried over from <b>multiplayer</b> to campaign made the mode feel rewarding for players. Reiner {{thought that the}} action featured in this mode is satisfying, but thought that the system lacked enough depth and complexity to engage players. Patterson echoed similar thoughts, and felt that the ability of players to switch between the campaign and the Chaos Squad mode made the <b>multiplayer</b> mode a rewarding experience. Brown criticized the mode, saying that its difficulty was not properly scaled.|$|E
5|$|The <b>multiplayer</b> side of Mysteries of the Sith was {{received}} positively, {{but did not}} completely escape criticism. Emil Pagliarulo of The Adrenaline Vault questioned why certain features seemed to be missing from the <b>multiplayer</b> mode that {{were present in the}} single-player mode. One such feature is the rancor which appears prominently in a single-player level but is not in any <b>multiplayer</b> maps.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Combat Evolved did {{not support}} online <b>multiplayer,</b> but players could play <b>multiplayer</b> locally via split-screen or System Link LAN. Anniversary adds revamped <b>multiplayer</b> and two-player co-op campaign support available both online via Xbox Live and offline locally. The game's <b>multiplayer</b> mode uses s engine and features seven remakes of Combat Evolved and Halo 2 maps. Anniversary also includes a new map based on Halos eponymous campaign level for , a wave-based survival <b>multiplayer</b> game type in which players and their allies fight enemy groups of scaling difficulty. Anniversary introduced artificially intelligent Firefight allies to the series.|$|E
5|$|Worms Armageddon {{includes}} {{a series of}} training missions, a single-player campaign with premade missions, a deathmatch mode in which the player fights increasingly difficult and outnumbered battles against the computer, local <b>multiplayer,</b> and online <b>multiplayer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although the Xbox {{version of}} Halo lacks {{official}} support for online <b>multiplayer</b> play, third-party packet tunneling software provide unofficial ways around this limitation. The Windows and Macintosh ports of Halo support online matches involving up to 16 players and include <b>multiplayer</b> maps {{not in the}} original Xbox release. However, co-operative play {{was removed from the}} ports because it would have required large amounts of recoding to implement. In April 2014, it was announced that GameSpy's servers and matchmaking, on which Halo PC relied, would be shut down by May 31 of the same year. A team of fans and Bungie employees announced they would produce a patch for the game to keep its <b>multiplayer</b> servers online. The patch was released on May 16, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Before its release, IGN {{was highly}} anticipating {{the final version}} of the game as they had played two {{previous}} versions of the game already. Concentrating on the <b>multiplayer</b> aspect of the game, they praised the developers for moving a solely platform game into the <b>multiplayer</b> genre so well. Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal was featured at the E3 games festival in 2004, where there was a playable demo. Only the <b>multiplayer</b> Siege mode and a single-player demo were available but they were enough to get 1UP.com's award for best action game at E3.|$|E
5|$|Character is {{available}} in campaign and <b>multiplayer</b> via downloadable content.|$|E
5|$|Characters can {{continue}} to level up through activities within the Peristylium while the PSP is in sleep mode, the game's UMD is running, and the PSP is charging. The <b>multiplayer</b> function, activated through the game's configuration screen, allows two other players to jump into another host player's game via an online connection. The allotted time for <b>multiplayer</b> {{is limited to a}} few minutes, with transitions between zones triggering the end of a <b>multiplayer</b> section. The time limit can be extended by players helping their current host. The first and last segments of the game are not open to <b>multiplayer.</b> There is also a function called Magical Academy Assist, in which NPCs named after members of the game's production team are summoned into battle to assist the cadets.|$|E
5|$|Crytek {{contracted}} Ruffian Games {{to develop}} a competitive <b>multiplayer</b> mode for Ryse, but the feature was later cut from the final game. Despite that, a co-operative <b>multiplayer</b> mode was introduced, and tasked players to fight against waves of increasingly difficult human enemies. The team originally hoped to add sea battles and animals to the game, but after internal testing, these features were removed. A Xbox SmartGlass feature called the Challenge Editor was set to be introduced to the game after its launch. It allowed players to create custom challenges for the game's co-operative <b>multiplayer.</b> However, Crytek announced {{that the development of}} this feature had been ceased in February 2014.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy Type-0 Online, a {{replacement}} for Agito, was developed for Android, iOS and Microsoft Windows. The gameplay features cooperative <b>multiplayer</b> similar to the original <b>multiplayer</b> elements of Type-0, along with hack-and-slash gameplay. Released in December 2016 in China, it is scheduled for a later release in Japan and under consideration for a release in North America and Europe.|$|E
5|$|Game Revolution {{said the}} <b>multiplayer</b> feature {{was a revelation}} and worth {{the cost of the}} game alone. Computer Games said it was {{innovative}} and may serve as an inspiration for future games. PC Gamer said the <b>multiplayer</b> mode was the redeeming factor of the game, though it was still marred by bugs. Others noted that aspects of the <b>multiplayer</b> interface were insufficient, such as the inability to store custom dialog, requiring the Storyteller to type text in real time during gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Graham was at {{the centre}} of {{development}} across platforms, and {{had no problem with}} the Game Gear version having vehicle behaviour similar to the NES version. Routledge and Saunders came up with the method of <b>multiplayer</b> on the same device. <b>Multiplayer</b> via link-up was difficult to implement, with problems such as the game losing sync.|$|E
5|$|Heroes of Mana {{features}} a local <b>multiplayer</b> option, where players can battle {{against each other}} using the progress they have made in the single-player game. There is no <b>multiplayer</b> support on the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service, though players {{can use it to}} access the Wi-Fi Heroes Ranking system to download additional maps, missions, and items.|$|E
5|$|In December 2012, {{official}} servers for Thrones and Patriots {{were shut}} down by GameSpy Technologies, which {{made it difficult for}} <b>multiplayer</b> matches to be played officially online. Programs like GameRanger could be used to continue playing <b>multiplayer</b> games online without the usage of official game servers.|$|E
5|$|In a {{first for}} the series, Days of Ruin {{includes}} online <b>multiplayer</b> over Nintendo's Wi-Fi Connection service, {{as well as a}} feature for players to share their own custom map designs and download maps made by others (custom maps and sharing custom maps is a feature present in all Advance Wars games). Over 150 premade maps are included in the game for use in local <b>multiplayer,</b> and designed for two, three, and four-player matches. <b>Multiplayer</b> games can be played with only one DS game card: each player can pass the game to the next player when it is their turn. It is also possible to set all sides to CPU, which is useful for studying the AI.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the single-player mode, Seeds of Evil features a <b>multiplayer</b> mode where various players can compete {{against each other in}} several game types. Options such as time limit, map to play on, and characters to play as can be changed to match player preference. Every character has their own strengths and weaknesses, with some being able to regenerate health. For example, the Raptor is limited to close-range attacks, but is also extremely fast and agile. <b>Multiplayer</b> games in the Nintendo 64 version of the game support up to four players via split screen. In contrast, <b>multiplayer</b> games in the Microsoft Windows version support up to 16 players via LAN or internet.|$|E
5|$|Including contractors, 350 {{people worked}} on the game. 343 Industries {{contracted}} Certain Affinity, an independent video game development studio, {{to help with the}} development of Halo 4; they started work on the game in early 2011. Certain Affinity has worked alongside Bungie and 343 Industries on producing <b>multiplayer</b> content for previous Halo titles. The studio developed the Forge mode, co-developed War Games and created a number of maps and <b>multiplayer</b> modes for Halo 4.|$|E
5|$|It was {{followed}} by Owen Rubin's Space Duel in 1982, featuring colorful geometric shapes and co-op <b>multiplayer</b> gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Its <b>multiplayer</b> {{features}} were praised; according to McCaffrey, the co-operative <b>multiplayer</b> mode had enough content {{for a separate}} game. Although he appreciated Spies vs. Mercs' faster pace, he found the mode less innovative than its predecessor. Reeves partially agreed, describing the revived Spies vs. Mercs mode as refreshing, intense, and bloody. De Matos wrote {{that it was one}} of the best <b>multiplayer</b> modes he had ever experienced, and the Blacklist version had evolved and modernized while remaining creative. Daniel Bloodworth of GameTrailers praised the game's satisfying co-op design, which tasks players to plan and coordinate strategy.|$|E
5|$|Khan {{appears as}} a Team-Up {{character}} in the massively <b>multiplayer</b> online role-playing game, Marvel Heroes, voiced by Erica Luttrell.|$|E
5|$|Midtown Madness {{supports}} <b>multiplayer</b> games via {{local area}} network, Internet, or serial cable connection. <b>Multiplayer</b> mode was originally supported by Microsoft's MSN Gaming Zone, but this service was retired on June 19, 2006. It is now supported by similar {{services such as}} GameSpy Arcade and XFire, via DirectPlay. <b>Multiplayer</b> mode includes a Cops and Robbers mode, a capture the flag-style game in which players form two teams and each team tries to steal the opposing team's cache of gold {{and return it to}} their own hideout.|$|E
