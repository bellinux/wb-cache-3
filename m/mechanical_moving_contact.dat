Geometrically, the problem may be characterized in terms of a conjugate triplet which is formed by the two shapes <b>moving</b> in <b>contact</b> and their relative motion.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we outline a front-tracking method for {{computing}} the <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> line. In particular, {{we are interested}} in the motion of two-dimensional drops and bubbles on a partially wetting surface exposed to shear flows. Peskinâ€™s Immersed Boundary Method is used to model the liquid-gas interface, similar to the approach used by Unverdi and Traggvason. The movement near the <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> line is modelled by a slip condition, the value of the dynamic contact angle is determined by a linear model, and the local forces are introduced at the <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> lines based on a relationship of <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> angle and contact line speed. Numerical examples show that the method {{can be applied to the}} motion of drops and bubbles on a solid surface over a wide range of parameter values. Key words. Moving drop on surface, <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> line, dynamic contact angle, and numerical computation. 1. Problem Description The motion of a drop on a solid surface has been a subject of extensive research since 1970 s not only because of its relevance to many industrial and engineering applications, but also due to the complication caused by the <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> line...|$|R
50|$|An {{external}} {{operating mechanism}} drives {{the motion of}} the <b>moving</b> <b>contact,</b> which opens and closes the connected circuit. The vacuum interrupter will include a guide sleeve to control {{the motion of the}} <b>moving</b> <b>contact,</b> and to protect the sealing bellows from any twisting, which would drastically shorten its life.|$|R
50|$|Many {{manufacturing}} variations exist, but {{in general}} a vacuum interrupter will have a fixed <b>contact,</b> a <b>moving</b> <b>contact,</b> a flexible bellows to allow movement of the <b>moving</b> <b>contact,</b> and arc shields, enclosed in a hermetic glass, ceramic or metal housing that is evacuated to a high vacuum. The <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> is connected by a flexible braid to the external circuit, and is moved by an actuating mechanism when the device is required to open or close. Since air pressure tends to close the contacts, the operating mechanism must hold the contacts open against the inherent closing force of air pressure on the bellows.|$|R

40|$|We {{developed}} a sharp interface level-set approach for two-phase immiscible flow with <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> lines. The Cox-Voinov model {{is used to}} describe the <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> line. A piecewise linear interface method is used to construct the signed distance function and to implement the contact angle boundary condition. Spurious currents are studied in the case of static and moving fluid interfaces, which show convergence behavior. Pressure and the surface tension force are balanced up to machine precision for static parabolic interfaces, while the velocity error decreases steadily with grid refinement when the interface is advected in a uniform flow field. The <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> line problem is studied and validated through comparison with theory and experiments for an advancing interface and capillary rise in a tube...|$|R
40|$|In early {{theoretical}} {{investigations of}} the <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> line [H. K. Moffatt, Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 18, 1 - 18 (1964), C. Huh and L. E. Scriven, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 35 (1971) ], an infinite force along the solid wall was reported based off the non-integrable stress along a single interface. Contrary to these results, this investigation demonstrates that while the stress is still singular, there is a finite point force at the <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> line singularity if the forces applied along all three interfaces {{that make up the}} <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> line are taken into consideration. Mathematically, this force is determined by summing all the forces that act over an infinitesimally small cylindrical control volume enclosing the <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> line. With this finite force, we predict the microscopic dynamic contact angle based off a balance of forces at the <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> line and subsequently combine our model with Cox's model for apparent dynamic contact angle [R. G. Cox, Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 168 169 - 194 (1986) ]. This combined model is in good agreement with published dynamic contact angle measurements and eliminates the microscopic dynamic contact angle as an empirical fitting parameter. In support of our results, the proposed analysis also independently predicts the known forces of two other singular Stokes flows that contain stress singularities, namely the cusped fluid interface and Stokeslet.

40|$|In {{immiscible}} two-phase flows, {{contact line}} denotes {{the intersection of}} the fluid-fluid interface with the solid wall. When one fluid displaces the other, the contact line moves along the wall. A classical problem in continuum hydrodynamics is the incompatibility between the <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> line and the no-slip boundary condition, as the latter leads to a non-integrable singularity. The recently discovered generalized Navier boundary condition (GNBC) offers an alternative to the no-slip boundary condition which can resolve the <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> line conundrum. We present a variational derivation of the GNBC through the principle of minimum energy dissipation (entropy production), as formulated by Onsager for small perturbations away from the equilibrium. Through numerical implementation of a continuum hydrodynamic model, it is demonstrated that the GNBC can quantitatively reproduce the <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> line slip velocity profiles obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. In particular, the transition from complete slip at the <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> line to near-zero slip far away is shown to be governed by a power-law partial slip regime, extending to mesoscopic length scales. The sharp (fluid-fluid) interface limit of the hydrodynamic model, together with some general implications of slip versus no-slip, are discussed. Comment: 44 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

40|$|The <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> line {{problem is}} one of the main unsolved {{fundamental}} problems in fluid mechanics, with relevant physical phenomena spanning multiple scales, from the molecular to the macroscopic scale. In this thesis, at the macroscale, it is shown that classical asymptotic analysis is applicable at the <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> line. This allows for a direct matching procedure between the inner (nanoscale) region and the outer (macroscale) region, therefore simplifying the analysis presented to date in the literature. At the mesoscale, a unified derivation for single and binary fluid diffuse interface models is presented, consolidating two models present in the literature. Results from an asymptotic analysis of the sharp interface limit of the binary fluid diffuse interface model are compared with numerical computations of the inner region in the vicinity of a <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> line. Finally, the nanoscale structure of the density profile in the vicinity of the con- tact line is studied using density functional theory (DFT). At equilibrium, an effective disjoining pressure is extracted and results are compared with coarse-grained Hamiltonian theory. A derivation of Navier-Stokes like dynamic DFT equations is presented. Results for the <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> line are compared with predictions from molecular kinetic theory. Computations for both DFT and diffuse interface approaches are performed using pseudospectral methods mapped to unbounded domains.

The <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> line behaviour is analysed for a general problem relevant for any density dependent dynamic viscosity and volume viscosity, and for general microscopic contact angle and double well free-energy forms. Away from the contact line, analysis of the diffuse-interface model shows that the Navier [...] Stokes equations and classical interfacial boundary conditions are obtained at leading order in the sharp-interface limit, justifying the creeping flow problem imposed in an intermediate region in the seminal work of Seppecher [Int.

40|$|Having {{conducted}} the research {{described in this}} thesis I found that there exists a possibility to produce polyelectrolyte nanostructures on hydrophobic surfaces by application of the <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> line approach. It was demonstrated that the morphology of nanostructures displays a range of structure variations from root-like to a single wire structure with a high anisotropy and aspect ratio (providing diameters of several nanometers and the length limited by the sample surface dimensions).

However, the continuum description of the flow towards or away from a contact line implies that the forces diverge as one approaches a <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> line. This fundamental problem is of relevance to many applications, and in particular to the development and application of immersion lithography, where a liquid droplet is positioned between the lithographic optical head and the substrate that moves under it.
