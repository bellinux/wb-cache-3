5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>natural</b> {{diamonds}} contain extended {{planar defects}} in the <100> lattice planes, which are called platelets. Their size ranges from nanometers to many micrometers, and large ones are easily observed in an optical microscope via their luminescence. For a long time, platelets were tentatively associated with large nitrogen complexes — nitrogen sinks produced {{as a result}} of nitrogen aggregation at high temperatures of the diamond synthesis. However, direct measurement of nitrogen in the platelets by EELS (an analytical technique of electron microscopy) revealed very little nitrogen. The currently accepted model of platelets is a large regular array of carbon interstitials.|$|E
5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>natural</b> {{membranes}} are {{a complex}} mixture of different lipid molecules. If {{some of the}} components are liquid at a given temperature while others are in the gel phase, the two phases can coexist in spatially separated regions, rather like an iceberg floating in the ocean. This phase separation plays {{a critical role in}} biochemical phenomena because membrane components such as proteins can partition into one or the other phase and thus be locally concentrated or activated. One particularly important component of many mixed phase systems is cholesterol, which modulates bilayer permeability, mechanical strength, and biochemical interactions.|$|E

50|$|Romania {{has proven}} natural gas {{reserves}} of 630 billion cubic meters (22.94 Tcf) and is ranked 30th among country's with proved reserves of <b>natural</b> gas. <b>Most</b> of Romania's <b>natural</b> gas resources {{are located in}} Transylvania, Moldavia, Wallachia and the Black Sea with around 75% being located in Transylvania especially in Mureş and Sibiu counties. The <b>most</b> important <b>natural</b> gas fields in Transylvania are Abrămuţ, Bazna, Benţid, Brădeşti, Copşa Mică, Cuşmed, Deleni, Filitelnic, Firtuşu, Ibăneşti, Laslău Mare, Salonta, Sărmaşel, Sighişoara, Şamşud and Zau de Câmpie.

5|$|The {{abundance}} of actinium in the Earth's crust {{is only about}} 5%. Actinium is mostly present in uranium-containing, but also in other minerals, though in much smaller quantities. The content of actinium in <b>most</b> <b>natural</b> objects corresponds to the isotopic equilibrium of parent isotope 235U, {{and it is not}} affected by the weak Ac migration. Protactinium is more abundant (10−12%) in the Earth's crust than actinium. It was discovered in the uranium ore in 1913 by Fajans and Göhring. As actinium, the distribution of protactinium follows that of 235U.|$|E
5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>natural</b> and {{convenient}} {{way to express}} the relation involves the algebraic concept of exact sequences: sequences of objects (in this case groups) and morphisms (in this case group homomorphisms) between them such {{that the image of}} one morphism equals the kernel of the next. In general, this does not allow (co)homology groups of a space to be completely computed. However, because many important spaces encountered in topology are topological manifolds, simplicial complexes, or CW complexes, which are constructed by piecing together very simple patches, a theorem such as that of Mayer and Vietoris is potentially of broad and deep applicability.|$|E

5|$|While lipid tails {{primarily}} modulate bilayer phase behavior, {{it is the}} headgroup {{that determines}} the bilayer surface chemistry. <b>Most</b> <b>natural</b> bilayers are composed primarily of phospholipids, although sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin and sterols such as cholesterol are also important components. Of the phospholipids, the most common headgroup is phosphatidylcholine (PC), accounting for about half the phospholipids in most mammalian cells. PC is a zwitterionic headgroup, as it has a negative charge on the phosphate group and a positive charge on the amine but, because these local charges balance, no net charge.|$|E
5|$|After the Republic was proclaimed, the {{national}} flag was provisionally adopted as distinguishing {{flag of the}} head of state in place of the royal standard. On the initiative of the Ministry of Defence, a project was prepared in 1965 to adopt a distinct flag. Opportunity suggested the <b>most</b> <b>natural</b> solution was the Italian tricolour defaced with the coat of arms; however, under conditions of poor visibility, this could easily be mistaken for the standard of the President of the United States of Mexico, which is also that country's national flag. The standard is kept in the custody of the Commander of the Reggimento Corazzieri of the Arma dei Carabinieri, along with the war flag (assigned to Regiment in 1878).|$|E
5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>natural</b> {{resources}} were easily {{available in the}} immediate vicinity of the city. The nearby port at La Trinidad de Nosotros was an important hub for the import of exotic goods and export of local products such as chert and ceramics. Other goods not immediately available were likely to have been provided by the city’s satellite sites. The local area provided a number of different soils suitable for varied agricultural use, and the port at La Trinidad de Nosotros provided the city with freshwater products such as turtles, crocodiles and freshwater molluscs. Deer were hunted locally and provided an important source of protein for the upper class, while freshwater snails were the main source of protein for commoners.|$|E

5|$|Protactinium {{occurs in}} {{uraninite}} (pitchblende) at concentrations of about 0.3-3 parts 231Pa per million parts (ppm) of ore. Whereas the usual content {{is closer to}} 0.3 ppm (e.g. in Jáchymov, Czech Republic), some ores from the Democratic Republic of the Congo have about 3 ppm. Protactinium is homogeneously dispersed in <b>most</b> <b>natural</b> materials and in water, but at much lower concentrations {{on the order of}} one part per trillion, that corresponds to the radioactivity of 0.1 picocuries (pCi)/g. There is about 500 times more protactinium in sandy soil particles than in water, even the water present in the same sample of soil. Much higher ratios of 2,000 and above are measured in loam soils and clays, such as bentonite.|$|E
5|$|The Scuppernong had {{remained}} largely undeveloped throughout history. In 1793, {{the town of}} Columbia was built on its banks, as were several boat landings. The Scuppernong is a blackwater river: it water is colored like black tea or coffee. The Scuppernong served {{as a means of}} transportation for the early settlers in this region of North Carolina. Since 1989 the Nature Conservancy has sought to protect it in its <b>most</b> <b>natural</b> state. In 2002 the Nature Conservancy offered to donate four tracts of land that they owned along the Scuppernong if the state would purchase three more tracts that became available that same year. The state agreed and in 2004 the area along the river was officially added to the state park system.|$|E
5|$|This {{explains}} the <b>most</b> <b>natural</b> plans for both sides. White will try a minority {{attack on the}} queenside, {{in order to increase}} its space advantage and to create some weaknesses in the black pawns (e.g. an isolated pawn or a backward pawn). So White will try to use the advances b2–b4 or c4–c5 in good conditions, supported by the queen and the rooks on the c-file and the d-file. On the other hand, Black will try to keep the position closed, most importantly by keeping the c4-pawn where it is {{in order to keep the}} Bf1 at bay. This can be achieved by moves like b7–b6 and d7–d6, and sometimes the manoeuvre Ne5–d7–f8–e6. The first move by Black has to be 10...d6! because otherwise White plays 11.c5! and gets a clear advantage immediately. For example 10...b6? loses a pawn to 11.Qd5 Nc6 12.Bxc7, and 10...0-0?! is bad because of 11.c5! Qxc5? 12.Rc1 Qe7 13.Rxc7 and White is winning already.|$|E
