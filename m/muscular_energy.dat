6000|$|... 133. Be it so. Let it even be {{admitted}} that egoism {{is the only}} power conceivable by a modern metaphysician to be the spring of mental energy; just as chemical excitement {{may be the only}} power traceable by the modern physician as the source of <b>muscular</b> <b>energy.</b> And still Mr. Spencer's subsequent analysis is inaccurate, and unscholarly. For egoism does not necessarily imply either misapprehension or mismeasurement. There are modes of the love of our country which are definitely selfish, as a cat's of the hearthrug, yet entirely balanced and calm in judicial faculty; passions which determine conduct, but have no influence on opinion. For instance, I have bought for my own exclusive gratification, the cottage in which I am writing, near the lake-beach on which I used to play when I was seven years old. Were I a public-spirited scientific person, or a benevolently pious one, I should doubtless, instead, be surveying the geographical relations of the Mountains of the Moon, or translating the Athanasian Creed into Tartar-Chinese. But I hate the very name of the public, and labor under no oppressive anxiety either for the advancement of science, or the salvation of mankind. I therefore prefer amusing myself with the lake-pebbles, of which I know nothing but that they are pretty; and conversing with people whom I can understand without pains, and who, so far from needing to be converted, seem to me on the whole better than myself. This is moral egoism, but it is not intellectual error. I never form, much less express, any opinion as to the relative beauties of Yewdale crag and the Mountains of the Moon; nor do I please myself by contemplating, in any exaggerated light, the spiritual advantages which I possess in my familiarity with the Thirty-nine Articles. I know the height of my neighboring mountains to a foot; and the extent of my real possessions, theological and material, to an article. Patriotic egoism attaches me to the one; personal egoism satisfies me in the other; and the calm selfishness with which Nature has blessed all her unphilosophical creatures, blinds me to the attractions--as to the faults--of things with which I have no concern, and saves me at once from the folly of contempt, and the discomfort of envy. I might have written, as accurately, [...] "The discomfort of contempt"; for indeed the forms of petulant rivalry and self-assertion which Mr. Spencer assumes to be developments of egoism, are merely its diseases; (taking the word [...] "disease" [...] in its most literal meaning). A man of sense is more an egoist in modesty than a blockhead is in boasting; and it is neither pride nor self-respect, but only ignorance and ill-breeding, that either disguise the facts of life, or violate its courtesies.|$|E

40|$|Many plethodontid {{salamanders}} project {{their tongues}} ballistically {{at high speed}} and for relatively great distances. Capturing evasive prey relies on the tongue reaching the target in minimum time, therefore {{it is expected that}} power production, or the rate of energy release, is maximized during tongue launch. We examined the dynamics of tongue projection in three genera of plethodontids (Bolitoglossa, Hydromantes and Eurycea), representing three independent evolutionary transitions to ballistic tongue projection, by using a combination of high speed imaging, kinematic and inverse dynamics analyses and electromyographic recordings from the tongue projector muscle. All three taxa require high-power output of the paired tongue projector muscles to produce the observed kinematics. Required power output peaks in Bolitoglossa at values that exceed the greatest maximum instantaneous power output of vertebrate muscle that has been reported by more than an order of magnitude. The high-power requirements are likely produced through the elastic storage and recovery of <b>muscular</b> kinetic <b>energy.</b> Tongue projector muscle activity precedes the departure of the tongue from the mouth by an average of 117 ms in Bolitoglossa, sufficient time to load the collagenous aponeuroses within the projector muscle with potential energy that is subsequently released at a faster rate during tongue launc...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-The {{hypothesis}} that {{the sum of the}} absolute changes in mechanical energy (internal work) is correlated with the <b>muscular</b> mechanical <b>energy</b> expenditure (MMEE) was tested using two elliptical chainrings, one that reduced and one that increased the internal work (compared to circular). Upper and lower bounds were put on the extra MMEE (work done by net joint torques in excess of the external work) with respect o the effect of intercompensation between joint torques due to biarticular muscles. This was done by having two measures of MMEE, one that allowed no intercompensation and one that allowed complete intercompensation between joints spanned by biarticular muscles. Energy analysis showed no correlation between internal work and the two measures of MMEE. When compared to circular, the chainring that reduced internal work increased MMEE, and phases of increased crank velocity associated with the elliptical shape resulted in increased power absorbed by the upstroke leg as it was accelerated against gravity. The resulting negative work necessitated additional positive work. Thus, the {{hypothesis that}} the internal work is correlated with MMEE was found to be invalid, and the total mechanical work done cannot be estimated by summing the internal and external work. Changes in the dynamics of cycling caused by a non-circular chainring may affect performance and must be considered during the non-circular chainring design process...|$|R
40|$|Paediatric obesity arises as {{a result}} of a {{positive}} energy balance. A positive energy balance may be due to a reduced energy expenditure or increased energy intake. The reduced energy expenditure is often due to a reduced energy cost of activity, but a reduction in energy expenditure at rest can sometimes occur. In some disease states, such as Duchenne <b>muscular</b> dystrophy, <b>energy</b> imbalance may be a result of a decrease in resting energy expenditure, due to alterations in body composition, or energy metabolism. Regardless of the aetiology, the basis of dietary prescription to create an energy deficit relies on the accurate assessment of energy requirements. The use of the doubly labelled water method to measure total energy expenditure, and in turn, energy requirements, is impractical and costly in a clinical setting. As a result, predictive equations and self-reported measures of physical activity and energy intake, to establish baseline energy requirements, are frequently used. Current equations are based on data obtained from healthy paediatric populations, and the use of such equations to estimate energy requirements in populations whom differ from the norm are yet to be established. Furthermore, the accurate assessment of body composition is vital for evaluating and monitoring the success of various management programmes. While many body composition analysis techniques were developed in healthy adult populations, the use of these techniques in clinical, paediatric populations is questionable. To provide an insight into these issues, this thesis explored the assessment of energy requirements and body composition in two different paediatric cohorts (obese children and adolescents, and ambulatory boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy). Additionally, the feasibility of a reduced dose of isotopes in the doubly labelled water technique was assessed in a cohort of healthy control children...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionOptimising {{the first}} model {{developing}} heterotopic ossification (HO) on paraplegic mouse requires the study of cardiotoxin intramuscular injection substitution by a mechanical injury. Two lines of research were developed: pressure by extended crush and brief high-energy physical impact, with and without IM injection of LPS (purified bacterial lipopolysaccharides). MaterialThe first kind of mechanical injury evaluated was the crush with a pressure manometer Jamar®. The hamstring of the hind limbs of five groups of paraplegic mice underwent pressure forces from 2. 5 to 10 kg with compression length going from 5 to 25 seconds. The second involved a brief high-energy physical impact on thigh muscles through an impactor, making possible a defined and reproducible soft tissue contusion. The hamstring of hind limbs of 2 subgroups of paraplegic mice underwent 2 different forces of <b>muscular</b> impact (<b>energy</b> for impact 1 = 0. 19 J & for impact 2 = 0. 32 J). In these two experiments, a spinal cord injury of T 6 level was made, associated or not to LPS injection. The presence and {{the volume of the}} HO was measured by μCT after fixation and decalcification. ResultsThere was no HO: (1) in the different groups after muscular crush and in the control groups with and without injection of LPS in the hamstring. (2) Neither in the brief high-energy impact without LPS groups. On the other hand, we found HO in the hamstrings of the brief high-energy impact with LPS injection group (n= 7 mice) (mean volume: 0. 355 mm 3 for impact 1 and 0. 76 mm 3 for impact 2; mean density: 209. 75 mg HA/cm 2 for impact 1 and 265. 5 mg HA/cm 2 for impact 2).

Sequence rank variation of individual bones, phylogenetic analysis, and algorithm-based heterochrony optimization using event pairs were employed. Phylogenetic analysis only recovers Marsupialia, Australidelphia, and Eulipotyphla. Little heterochrony is found within marsupials and placentals. However, heterochrony was observed between marsupials and placentals, relating to late ossification in hind limb long bones and early ossification of the anterior axial skeleton. Also, ossification rank position of marsupial forelimb and shoulder girdle elements is more conservative than that of placentals; in placentals the hind limb area is more conservative. The differing ossification patterns in marsupials can be explained with a combination of <b>muscular</b> strain and <b>energy</b> allocation constraints, both resulting from the requirement of active movement of the altricial marsupial neonates toward the teat. Peramelemorphs, which are comparatively passive at birth and include species with relatively derived forelimbs, differ little from other marsupials in ossification sequence.

60|$|On {{this subject}} {{one person at}} least shared her bias. Whenever she met Lucian Webber, they talked about Cashel, {{invariably}} coming {{to the conclusion that}} though the oddity of his behavior had gratified Lydia's unfortunate taste for eccentricity, she had never regarded him with serious interest, and would not now, under any circumstances, renew her intercourse with him. Lucian found little solace in these conversations, and generally suffered from a vague sense of meanness after them. Yet next time they met he would drift into discussing Cashel over again; and he always rewarded Alice for the admirable propriety of her views by dancing at least three times with her when dancing was the business of the evening. The dancing was still less congenial than the conversation. Lucian, who had at all times too much of the solemnity of manner for which Frenchmen reproach Englishmen, danced stiffly and unskilfully. Alice, whose <b>muscular</b> power and <b>energy</b> were superior to anything of the kind that Mr. Mellish could artificially produce, longed for swift motion and violent exercise, and, even with an expert partner, could hardly tame herself to the quietude of dancing as practised in London.

We see this in the case of men who are doomed for long periods to solitary confinement. The force derived from their food, and released within their systems by the vital processes, being cut off by the silence and solitude of the dungeon from all usual and natural outlets, begins to work mischief within, by disorganizing the cerebral and other vital organs, and producing insanity and death.|$|R
