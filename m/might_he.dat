5|$|Blessed be God's name? Why, but {{why would}} I bless Him? Every fiber in me rebelled. Because He caused {{thousands}} of children to burn in His mass graves? Because He kept six crematoria working day and night, including Sabbath and the Holy Days? Because in His great <b>might,</b> <b>He</b> had created Auschwitz, Birkenau, Buna, {{and so many other}} factories of death? How could I say to Him: Blessed be Thou, Almighty, Master of the Universe, who chose us among all nations to be tortured day and night, to watch as our fathers, our mothers, our brothers end up in the furnaces?...|$|E
5|$|Freitas finds {{numerous}} {{reasons why}} interstellar probes {{may be a}} preferred method of communication among extraterrestrial civilizations wishing {{to make contact with}} Earth. A civilization aiming {{to learn more about the}} distribution of life within the galaxy <b>might,</b> <b>he</b> speculates, send probes to a large number of star systems, rather than using radio, as one cannot ensure a response by radio but can (he says) ensure that probes will return to their sender with data on the star systems they survey. Furthermore, probes would enable the surveying of non-intelligent populations, or those not yet capable of space navigation (like humans before the 20th century), as well as intelligent populations that might not wish to provide information about themselves and their planets to extraterrestrial civilizations. In addition, the greater energy required to send living beings rather than a robotic probe would, according to Michaud, be only used for purposes such as a one-way migration.|$|E
25|$|The Meditator {{finds it}} almost {{impossible}} to keep his habitual opinions and assumptions out of his head, try as he <b>might.</b> <b>He</b> resolves to pretend that these opinions are totally false and imaginary in order to counterbalance his habitual way of thinking. The Meditator wishes to avoid an excess of skepticism and instead uses a skeptical method, an important distinction. He supposes that not God, but some evil demon has committed itself to deceiving him so that everything he thinks he knows is false. By doubting everything, he can at least be sure not to be misled into falsehood by this demon.|$|E

25|$|The hrossa honour Ransom greatly {{by asking}} him to join them in a hunt for a hnakra (plural hnéraki), a fierce water-creature {{which seems to be}} the only {{dangerous}} predator on the planet, resembling both a shark and a crocodile. While hunting, Ransom and his hrossa companions are told by an eldil, an almost invisible creature reminiscent of a spirit or deva, that Ransom must go to meet Oyarsa, the eldil who is ruler of the planet—and indeed that he already should have done so. He hesitates to respond to the summons, as he wishes to proceed with the hunt. Hyoi, after killing the hnakra with Ransom's help, is shot dead by Devine and Weston, who are seeking Ransom in order to take him prisoner and hand him over to the séroni. Ransom is told by Hyoi's friend (another hross named Whin) that this is the consequence of disobeying Oyarsa, and that Ransom must now cross the mountains to escape Weston and Devine and fulfil his orders. On his journey, Ransom finally meets a sorn, as he long feared he <b>might.</b> <b>He</b> finds, however, that the séroni are peaceful and kindly. Augray (the sorn) explains to him the nature of Oyarsa's body, and that of all eldila. The next day, carrying the human on his shoulders, Augray takes Ransom to Oyarsa.|$|E
500|$|The act must be {{inherently}} criminal [...] {{the case}} in point is that of R v Andrews, where the defendant had killed whilst driving dangerously. It was only the fact that the driving was dangerous that made it a crime, not the driving itself. Accordingly, Andrews removed driving and regulatory offences from the scope of constructive manslaughter. There are separate rules for causing death by dangerous driving and some regulatory offences. Some commentators took Andrews as excluding strict liability and negligence cases out of constructive manslaughter, although contrary to the exact wording in the judgment there; however, a separate case also called R v Andrews convicted the defendant of constructive manslaughter based on a strict liability offence and this alternative proposition cannot be supported. Gross negligence manslaughter exists as a complementary form, and, if a driver was sufficiently negligent, as well he <b>might,</b> <b>he</b> would be liable for it. This provides an additional reason to exclude such cases from constructive manslaughter.|$|E
500|$|In the New Year, Pooter is {{promoted}} to senior clerk at Perkupp's, and his salary raised by £100 a year, but his achievement is overshadowed by Lupin's announcement {{that he has}} just profited by £200 through a timely shares speculation. Lupin persuades his father, and Gowing and Cummings, to invest small sums in Parachikka Chlorates, {{the source of his}} gains. The Pooters meet a new friend of Lupin's, Mr Murray Posh, who Pooter thinks is somewhat over-familiar with Daisy and <b>might,</b> <b>he</b> warns Lupin, be a rival for her hand. [...] Lupin pooh-poohs this notion. Later, Pooter learns that he and his friends have lost their investment; indeed, Lupin's stockbroking firm has collapsed entirely and its principal has fled. Lupin is thus unemployed; worse, that same day the engagement of Daisy Mutlar to Murray Posh is announced. Lupin's only consolation, he tells his father, is that he persuaded Posh to invest £600 in Parachikka Chlorates. However, in Pooter's eyes the [...] situation is redeemed when Mr Perkupp offers Lupin a clerkship.|$|E

2500|$|The Emperor {{no sooner}} heard of Otto's confinement, than he [...] again {{prepared}} to attack [...] Brunswick. His son, the Roman king, was [...] detached [...] with [...] a [...] considerable force to seize [...] upon the city; and [...] that more weight <b>might</b> <b>he</b> {{given to the}} expedition, the Duke of Bavaria was prevailed upon to accompany him. But on their approach, they found the gates shut, and the citizens prepared to defend their liberties, while they learnt, at the same time, that the King of Denmark was advancing upon their rear. They were therefore compelled to sound a retreat; and luckily for the captive prince, the emperor had become involved in matters of higher importance, which we shall now briefly notice, and was under the necessity of withdrawing his attention from the conquest of Brunswick.|$|E
2500|$|Noting that Moses asked God to {{designate}} someone {{to succeed him}} in [...] soon after the incident of Zelophehad's daughters, a Midrash deduced that when the daughters of Zelophehad inherited from their father, Moses argued that it would surely be right for his sons to inherit his glory. God, however, replied (in the words of [...] ) that [...] "Whoever keeps the fig-tree shall eat its fruit; and whoever waits on the master shall be honored." [...] The sons of Moses sat idly by and did not study Torah, but Joshua served Moses and showed him great honor, rose {{early in the morning}} and remained late at night at the House of Assembly, and arranged the benches and spread the mats. As he had served Moses with all his <b>might,</b> <b>he</b> was worthy to serve Israel, and thus God in [...] directed Moses to [...] "take Joshua the son of Nun" [...] as his successor.|$|E
2500|$|Philosophical anarchists may {{accept the}} {{existence}} of a minimal state as an unfortunate, and usually temporary, [...] "necessary evil" [...] but argue that citizens do not have a moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy. As conceived by Godwin, it requires individuals to act in accordance with their own judgments and to allow every other individual the same liberty; conceived egoistically as by Max Stirner, it implies that [...] "the unique one" [...] who truly [...] "owns himself" [...] recognizes no duties to others; within the limit of his <b>might,</b> <b>he</b> does what is right for him. Godwin opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present [...] "necessary evil" [...] that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge. Godwin advocated extreme individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labor be eliminated. Godwin felt discrimination on any grounds besides ability was intolerable.|$|E

2500|$|King Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki, {{a native}} Pole, {{was elected to}} replace John II Casimir in 1669. The Second Polish–Ottoman War (1672–76) broke out during his reign, which lasted until 1673, [...] and {{continued}} under his successor, John III Sobieski (1674–1696). Sobieski intended to pursue Baltic area expansion (and to this end he signed the secret Treaty of Jaworów with France in 1675), but was forced instead to fight protracted wars with the Ottoman Empire. By doing so, Sobieski briefly revived the Commonwealth's military <b>might.</b> <b>He</b> defeated the expanding Muslims at the Battle of Khotyn in 1673 and decisively helped deliver Vienna from a Turkish onslaught at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Sobieski's reign marked the last high point {{in the history of}} the Commonwealth: in the first half of the 18th century, Poland ceased to be an active player in international politics. The Eternal Peace Treaty with Russia of 1686 was the final border settlement between the two countries before the First Partition of Poland in 1772.|$|E
2500|$|Ray is head chef at The Queen Victoria, is in a {{relationship}} with Kat's friend Kim Fox (Tameka Empson) and is trusted by Alfie, of which Inside Soap said an affair [...] "seems unimaginable, but <b>might</b> <b>he</b> surprise us with his actions?" [...] They called Ray [...] "eye candy" [...] for Kat, saying [...] "it's never a bad thing" [...] for her, and noted that she appreciates him as her head chef. For Kat to have an affair with Ray would not only mean betraying Alfie but also Kim. They felt that Ray was the most obvious choice, and had not yet had a major storyline, and an affair would shock viewers and have a big impact on Ray's family life. They also said that they would not blame Kat for an affair with Ray as he is [...] "gorgeous, sensitive and has a six-pack to die for". Soaplife opined that Ray was the [...] "red herring", as actor Venn has said he would like Ray to marry Kim and start a family, and later said that all hints were pointing to Ray, so [...] "it would be no kind of mystery if it is him." [...] All About Soap said that Ray's [...] "flirty banter with Kat has sent her into a spin", but were not sure Ray would be the one having the affair, especially after Kat picks Alfie for the football team over Ray, and made him joint third most likely, along with Derek. The magazine later opined that [...] "lovely" [...] Ray would not have it in him to cheat, but thought he may have tired of Kim's behaviour. Empson told Inside Soap that she was unsure if Kat would cheat on Ray as Kim is her best friend, while Venn said that [...] "Kat's a saucy minx, and what man wouldn't want to get involved with her? Ray is a loyal, caring father, but we all have our dark sides. There's a lot the audience hasn't seen yet, put it that way..." [...] Venn also said, [...] "I would love it to be me—for the drama, of course. Why not? You can just imagine the kind of drama which would ensue with Kim. It'd be fight of the century, that one. Dynasty would have nothing on this!" [...] Venn also {{said in an interview that}} he was looking forward to kissing scenes with Wallace, implying that Ray could be Kat's lover. Ray was the first of the five suspects to be eliminated, on 7 August 2012.|$|E
