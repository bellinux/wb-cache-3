500|$|In 1984, {{director}} Rob Reiner, producer Andy Scheinman {{and writer}} Nora Ephron met over {{lunch at the}} Russian Tea Room in New York City to develop a project. Reiner pitched {{an idea for a}} film that Ephron rejected. The second meeting transformed into a long discussion about Reiner and Scheinman's lives as single men. Reiner remembers, [...] "I was in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> single life. I'd been divorced for a while. I'd been out a number of times, all these disastrous, confusing relationships one after another". The next time they all met, Reiner said that he had always wanted to do a film about two people who become friends and do not have sex because they know it will ruin their relationship but have sex anyway. Ephron liked the idea, and Reiner acquired a deal at a studio.|$|E
500|$|... "It Girl" [...] is a mid-tempo pop and R love song, {{built on}} a finger-clicking beat. The song is set in common time with a {{moderate}} tempo of 95 beats per minute.

According to Rap-Up, the song's lyrics find Derulo as the male protagonist singing praises of [...] "a lovely lady", comparing her to his [...] "greatest hit".

Its hook, which forms part of the chorus, contains the lyrics: [...] "You could be my it girl / Baby, you're the shit girl / Lovin; you could be a crime / Crazy how we fit, girl / This is it, girl / Gimme 25 to life / I just wanna rock all night long and put you in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> spotlight / You could be my it girl / You're my biggest hit, girl / Let me play it loud."

But of this I allowed no sign to show, no suspicion even. I continued to lie there day after day in a state of complete collapse, so that whilst I was quickly gathering strength it was believed by my gaolers that I was steadily sinking, and that I should soon be dead.|$|R
2500|$|The third Baldrick is {{much more}} noticeably crude and unintelligent than those {{previous}} to him and maybe even the most stupid of all four Baldricks. Like his Elizabethan ancestor, he is known to eat dung occasionally.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Talk magazine in late 1999, Schwarzenegger {{was asked if he}} thought of running for office. He replied, [...] "I think about it many times.

Following his initial comments, Schwarzenegger said, [...] "I'm in show business– I am in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> career.

2500|$|As a {{footnote}} to this event, many years later, I ran across Lt. Comdr. Carpenter (by that time Admiral Carpenter) at a Helena reunion and he filled in some details that I hadn't known. We were seated {{across from each}} other at a dinner table. We were all telling sea stories and I started telling them my story (I had forgotten that it was Commander Carpenter who had issued the orders to the wheel). Right in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> story Carpenter looked at me and said, [...] "And do you know who issued those orders?" [...] When I admitted that I didn't remember, but wished that I could, he replies, [...] "I did." [...] The minute he said that, I remembered.|$|E

As I looked at it, it exploded with a sharp report quite impossible to confuse with the continuous turmoil of the lightning, thunder and hail, or that of the lashed water and smashed wood which was creating a pandemonium outside the cottage. I felt a very slight shock in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> right hand, which was closer to the globe than any other part of my body." ...|$|E

Maggie and Jonathan's romance was new territory for Hendrickson, as her character's sexual activity increased:Because I play a sexually confused character, I have not {{had to do a}} lot of sex scenes (giggles). Maggie lost her virginity to Henry in her dorm room, and it was PC, pretty chaste. Well, not with Jonathan! When we did our first big love scene, I was so surprised about how prudish and shy I became! It's like I became 16 again. I had to drop the blanket that was covering me, and in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> kiss with Jeff Branson, Jonathan], I started cracking up. He was like, 'What did I do, what did I do?' And I was like, 'Nothing! It wasn't you! I'm a 25-year-old professional woman. What is wrong with me?' I couldn't believe myself!' Everyone else does these scenes all the time, they're basically naked and it's no big deal, and I'm like, 'I need everyone to leave the set!' I'm a prude! ...|$|E
