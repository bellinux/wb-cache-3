40|$|Since the 1970 s, {{automatic}} identification (auto-ID) technologies have been evolving to revolutionise {{the way people}} live and work. Previous research has not addressed auto-ID technological innovation as a field of study, despite its growing importance on consumer, business and government electronic commerce (EC) applications. This paper is specifically concerned with five auto-ID technologies, bar codes, <b>magnetic-stripe</b> <b>card,</b> smart card, biometrics and radiofrequency identification (RF/ID) tags and transponders. Using multiple embedded case studies and applying the fundamental concepts of the systems of innovation (SI) approach, the overall aim is to understand the selection environment of the auto-ID industry. The results show that industry competition encourages the coexistence of numerous auto-ID technologies, dispelling the idea that one superior technology will make all others obsolete. This {{can be seen by}} the trends of migration, integration and convergence that are occurring in auto-ID innovation today. The significance of the study rests in its practical contributions. Stakeholders will benefit by becoming more aware of the opportunities in the market for the recombination of one or more auto-ID techniques. Additionally, suppliers of auto-ID system components will understand the new paradigm where various auto-ID firms can share in the same trajectory successfully...|$|E

40|$|Access {{control has}} been a great concern in this Information and Communication Technology (ICT) era. The need to control access to certain {{information}} and resources has been taken seriously by the ICT community. This research believes that no single security method, algorithm, key or procedure is entirely secure. Hence, a combination of multiple security components is mandatory to provide a high level of protection against fraud and other threats. This research combines two security components, which are the smart card and fingerprint recognition. It looks into the vulnerabilities of <b>magnetic-stripe</b> <b>cards</b> and Personal Identification Numbers (PIN) or passwords widely used in systems today. As a result, the research proposed a framework for user identification and authentication in automatic-teller-machine (ATM) systems using fingerprints and smart cards as opposed to the PIN and <b>magnetic-stripe</b> <b>cards...</b>|$|R

[...] In {{the case of the}} Belgian <b>magnetic-stripe</b> <b>cards</b> and Kazakh smart cards, independent voter verification of the contents of the ballot card is impossible.|$|R
40|$|Credit card fraud losses {{within the}} South African credit card market in 2006 {{exceeded}} R 257 M. A portion of these losses (R 179 M) {{are within the}} borders of South Africa and its common monetary area partners. This represents a startling 70 % of credit card fraud on magnetic stripe cards used within the borders of South Africa. The South African credit card industry adopts floor limits at certain merchants and merchant categories. South Africa {{is one of a}} few countries in the world that still adopt floor limits on credit cards within its payment card industry. Credit <b>card</b> transactions on <b>magnetic-stripe</b> <b>cards</b> conducted below the merchant’s designated floor limit do not go to the issuing bank for authorization. The first time the issuing bank acknowledges these transactions is when they are settled on average two days later. The rationale for not adopting zero floor limits within the South African credit card market is the supposed inability of the existing telecommunications infrastructure to handle the volume and frequency of data submitted by merchants for authorization. The impact of reduced fraud and bad debt losses through adopting a zero floor limit in relation to merchant operational costs is the basis of the research. The research also aims to examine the Proposition that the existing telecommunications infrastructure is unable to support a zero floor limit proposal...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally the {{approach}} used to analyse technological innovation {{focused on the}} application of the techno-economic paradigm with the production function as its foundation. This thesis explores the rise of the evolutionary paradigm as a more suitable conceptual approach to investigating complex innovations like automatic identification (auto-ID) devices. Collecting and analysing data for five auto-ID case studies, (bar codes, <b>magnetic-stripe</b> <b>cards,</b> smart cards, biometrics and RF/ID transponders), it became evident that a process of migration, integration and convergence is happening within the auto-ID technology system (TS). The evolution of auto-ID is characterised by a new cluster of innovations, primarily emerging through the recombination of existing knowledge. Using the systems of innovation (SI) framework this study explores the dynamics of auto-ID innovation, including organisational, institutional, economic, regulatory, social and technical dimensions. The results indicate that for a given auto-ID innovation to be successful there must be interaction between the various stakeholders within each dimension. The findings also suggest, that the popular idea that several technologies are superseded by one dominant technology in a given selection environment, does not hold true in the auto-ID industry. Each device studied has a significant role to fulfil in the marketplace, sharing in the same technological trajectory. Trends captured from the embedded case studies provide evidence for the continued growth in the requirement for auto-ID; they also point to an ever-increasing pervasiveness in auto-ID exemplified in the quest for the human electrophorus. Finally, as new auto-ID innovations are introduced, it is important to ensure that the adequate safeguards are put in place to protect citizens against accidental or intentional misuse. This is especially true of wireless applications that make use of wearable computing and microchip implants for tracking and monitoring purposes. Engineers therefore, should act in a socially responsible manner when inventing or patenting, viewing ethical discourse as an integral component of the innovation process, despite the competitive pressures for stakeholders to be first-to-market with new solutions...|$|R
40|$|The fraudsters, phishers, hackers, and pickpockets who thrive off payment card fraud {{may soon}} have their {{work cut out}} for them. U. S. {{financial}} institutions have announced plans to add computer chips to their debit and credit cards in the next few years, a move likely to make payment card fraud more difficult. Compared with the <b>magnetic-stripe</b> payment <b>cards</b> carried by millions of U. S. consumers, the new chip cards will offer stronger defenses against fraud. But they certainly will not put an end to it. In fact, as countries around the world have adopted computer-chip cards, new trends in fraud have emerged. France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom all switched from magnetic-stripe to computerchip payment cards, with mixed results. The fraudulent use of lost and stolen cards declined in both France and the United Kingdom. But fraudsters soon shifted tactics and exploited other weak links in payment card security. In the United Kingdom, the eventual succes...|$|R
40|$|This is {{an era of}} {{communication}} technology. This era has faced a lot of innovation in technology sector. Mobile phones were once used for calling or text messaging only, now slowly becoming competitor of computers. The rapid development of hardware, software and operating system of smartphones {{made it possible to}} do multiple tasks through the phones. Nowadays, smart phones have powerful operating systems which provide wide range of applications. Smart phones can be interfaced with external hardware also. The payment industry is about to see a drastic change because of these features. People can now pay through their smartphones; they can use payment cards to pay through it etc. But financial transaction is a very sensitive service and security is very crucial here. For financial services, the major security services such as confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, authorization and non-repudiation must be ensured. There are two major types of payment <b>cards,</b> <b>magnetic-stripe</b> based <b>cards</b> and chip based cards. Chip based card provides better security. Magnetic stripe based cards being static, is easy to counterfeit. But the fact that these magnetic stripe cards are still used in many countries, it is necessary to provide a security solution in order to protect customers from treachery. In this thesis, it has been investigated how to secure the mobile payment based on EMV standard. EMV is a chip based payment card. It has strong security features which made skimming or tampering it very hard. But, Magstripe based payments still remained insecure. This thesis paper aims to secure the transaction when paid with magnetic stripe based cards. Several measures have been taken to ensure that major security services are met. In addition, a prototype was developed and tested to demonstrate the practicality of the designed solution. The research results of this paper show that by transacting through the secured mobile payment protocol, customers can avail payment service more securely than traditional magnetic striped card based payments...|$|R
50|$|CTA's Automated Fare Collection (AFC) {{system was}} {{installed}} in 1997 by Cubic Transportation Systems, Inc., the largest provider of AFC systems in the USA. The AFC system replaced the CTA’s tokens with <b>magnetic-stripe</b> stored-value <b>cards</b> printed on plastic or paper based on Cubic's earlier MetroCard implementation in New York City. All fare collection and payment equipment {{was designed to be}} retrofitted at a later date with smart card readers, a technology that was on the horizon. A small pilot program (“Chicago Gold”) for reduced-fare disabled riders in 1999 led to a contract with Cubic to install smart card readers universally in 2000. In August 2000, a more extensive “Chicago Card” pilot program distributed stored-value smart cards to volunteer participants. The pilot program was expanded system-wide in November 2002. The Chicago Card Plus debuted in January 2004. “Go Lane” card readers were installed in the buses, starting in 2005, allowing Chicago Card users to bypass the line of passengers using the farebox; however, only one payment could be accepted at a time, eliminating this possible efficiency. The Go Lane card readers were removed starting in May 2010 and Chicago Card card readers were moved back to the main fare box.|$|R
